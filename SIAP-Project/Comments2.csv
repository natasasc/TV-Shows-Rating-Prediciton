The Fierce Wife,finally...good decision...don't be afraid
The Fierce Wife,我觉得很扣分的片段是 天慰和安真的吻戏。 有那个必要吗？还床上激情热吻勒。 安真人社是个保守，自重的女人。 而天慰是个对感情慢热，腼腆的人。 我是很想他们在一起，可是这样一个桥段让我觉得安真和天慰有点随便。 这不是我认识的安真，还我安真！ >.<
The Fierce Wife,Também é meio confuso queria saber se Rui ficou com a We e a criança
The Fierce Wife,A we conversou com a prima gostaria de saber oque
The Fierce Wife,Assusti a primeira temporada gostaria de assistir a segunda em português
The Fierce Wife,"Eu assisti essa série no telegram, mas lá foi cortada do episódio 24 pra frente.  Fiquei bem aborrecida 😥"
The Fierce Wife,Really enjoyed this series on Netflix. I agree asking for a divorce while your wife is in Hospital is unforgivable. So happy she did not take him back and has a Husband now that will appreciate her. Great acting.
The Fierce Wife,"Is this a the series or is it a movie along with it, I just started to watching these for the last few months and found only 2 shows with the younger male lead and he IA really talented did he Do more shows or movies, the main lead female was so good for this part in some parts it almost made me cry."
The Fierce Wife,She deserves to be happy  now
The Fierce Wife,🥰👍❤️❤️❤️❤️🇷🇴
The Fierce Wife,Subsidi indo
The Fierce Wife,Simplesmente amei a série.  Vi a temporada 1 na Netflix e a 2 aqui.  Ela sofreu muito e não merecia dá uma segunda chance ao ex. Ele a maltratou muito. Gostei do final!!😍
The Fierce Wife,"I love it 👌👌👌💃💃🥂🤗
Wat an amaizing great ending and superb msg"
The Fierce Wife,32:54 😭😭😭😭
The Fierce Wife,Que isso a 2° temporada??????
The Fierce Wife,"Estava procurando pela música da série, e encontrei  esse filme continuação da série amei, na série sofri junto com ela porque passei pela mesma situação, fiquei muito feliz porque os dois ficaram juntos no final, eu também tenho quatro anos que me separei mas ainda não encontrei o amor. Obrigada  por ter postado esse filme que nos proporcionou esse belíssimo final, simplesmente amei 🥰😍"
The Fierce Wife,"Que história !Acabei de assistir a série , retrata a vida de muitas famílias , infelizmente, mas que nós possamos ficar atentos , pois as perdas são muito grandes e não vale a pena."
The Fierce Wife,"terminei o dorama agora ai vim procurar a ost  pra baixar e encontro o filme. Maravilha,obrigada por postar!"
The Fierce Wife,"It’s good the female lead did not go back to her ex husband. After all the experiences she had with him,  I am happy she finally got a good man in the end. Asking for divorce while wife is in the hospital is unforgivable for me."
The Fierce Wife,"Though I expected something different, I'm glad those two ended up together. But I do wonder, what's the point of Wei En (is that how to spell it?) showing up only to disappear quickly? Is Oliver going to get to know his dad and sister?"

Schulz Saves America,This guy needs a daily talk show on Netflix
Schulz Saves America,Why is this clip so explicitly right wing?
Schulz Saves America,"Socially we aren't that bad. But politically, economically, healthwise, we are a shithole. A 3rd world country with iphones."
Schulz Saves America,Meanwhile in Texas the history books rebrand slaves as migrant workers
Schulz Saves America,"Love the way he spelled « laisser-faire », I'm glad that I'm Algerian, so I can easily understand few languages"
Schulz Saves America,LOL. Droning along was the best bit.
Schulz Saves America,"It's so true. Just went on a Batchelor party trip to Tennessee, and the other guys let the fact that we were in the south RUIN the trip. They saw racism everywhere we went. Shit talked literally everyone we met with an accent after they were out of earshot. It was insufferable. Too much mainstream media"
Schulz Saves America,"He's totally right. Trump knows how to create the tidal wave on CNN and MSNBC and he believes any publicity is good publicity. And they continually fall for it. But he's in control, because bashing him gets them ratings, and helps get him votes. But they just can't stop"
Schulz Saves America,That WAS an amazing joke!!
Schulz Saves America,"Thanks I’m writing an essay on this topic rn, hoping to write a book in the future about the things good and bad about America and comparisons"
Schulz Saves America,ur so right and i live in it and i already know its crazy but  im 8 in real life and i its nice most of the time
Schulz Saves America,This didn’t age well… instead of thinking you know politics and or grifting to get on Netflix after saying you didn’t want it is proof enough. This is what you get when your best friend is a Chile molester and he’s the only person you’ve never called out because Schulz is also a scumbag
Schulz Saves America,The USA is the most pathologic enterprise which has ever existed. Capitalism is pure evil
Schulz Saves America,This dude isn’t funny
Schulz Saves America,Finally someone talks about us the right way in Texas
Schulz Saves America,Exactly!
Schulz Saves America,"As a Texan, 100% agree. It’s the most diverse place ever. Especially politically"
Schulz Saves America,Unfortunately it really is that bad 😔
Schulz Saves America,Yo Andrew - that was a fucking amazing joke
Schulz Saves America,MAGA Wooooo yeah baby that's what I've been waiting for let's gooo

Tornado,"ㅇThen he said to them: “Nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. 
ㅇThere will be great earthquakes, famines and pestilences in various places, and fearful events and great signs from heaven. ㅇThere will be signs in the sun, moon and stars. On the earth, nations will be in anguish and perplexity at the roaring and tossing of the sea. 
ㅇPeople will faint from terror, apprehensive of what is coming on the world, for the heavenly bodies will be shaken. 
ㅇAt that time they will see the Son of Man coming in a cloud with power and great glory.""
‭‭[Luke‬ ‭21‬:‭10‬-‭11‬, ‭25‬-‭27‬]

“And as it is appointed unto men once to die, but after this the judgment:” [Hebrews‬ ‭9‬:‭27‬]

“For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.” [John‬ ‭3‬:‭16]

“(Jesus said) And this is the will of him that sent me, that every one which seeth the Son, and believeth on him, may have everlasting life: and I will raise him up at the last day.""
[John‬ ‭6‬:‭40]

ㅇthat if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. 
ㅇFor with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.

Tornado,lol
Tornado,People dying? Cringe
Tornado,Looks like we waiting for Wizard of Oz
Run On,They are ruining it by trying to make their shows more like western tv shows. especially the swearing. please don't.
Run On,Aniyoooo but is it only me The subtitles are hard to read it is bit fast but the storyline is good as far
Run On,"Estuvo bien, no es el mejor drama coreano que vi pero es tranquilo para relajarse un rato mientras lo ves. Mis personajes favoritos, son gyeom y dan ah. Divinos, nunca un personaje principal masculino fue tan dulce y Green flag. Siwan una vez más demostró lo buen actor que es. Recomiendo el drama si quieren algo no tan dramático y con un poco de romance."
Run On,"Yikes, so many corrupt, brutal people in this show - the father, the agent, the coach, the film director and I'm only at Ep. 3! Not sure I can keep watching this. I do care about the translator and curious to see if this series will crush her spirit or she'll rise above it!"
Run On,The male lead I think I have seen him in a kdrama wherein he is a villain/psycho
Run On,I have never seen such a boring lead actor in a series!!!🤷🏻‍♀️ Such a lame series🥱🥱..the scriptwriter had probably taken sleeping pills!!!!😴😴😴
Run On,"Second male n female lead were amazing, even d younger brother was good"
Run On,wait what is this about?
Run On,Just start watching this drama and I like it I feel sorry for the way the guy who work so hard to be a sprinter. Is been treated by his dad of all people. Where is the LOVE for your beautiful SON. Don’t let him get married to no one if it’s not LOVE. Don’t hurt him in this way. Let him live his life make his own choices. Right or wrong. I just want to give him a thousand hugs. I do I feel it for him. Beautiful soul first of all. We may be blessed with Children and no matter how we want things to go the way we want it. It just not happen that way. I hope father and son relationship heals and they get back on track. And enjoy each other. Because LIFE is SHORT. And you need to have good memories of your parents. They are not here FOREVER. This is my opinion great drama by the way. ❤️💕
Run On,I love this drama 💖 Siwan and Se Kyung are very beautiful.  ✨😭 This drama is harmless and healing and taught me to take good care of myself.  ✨🍀
Run On,There should be an English dub of this!  The main character dubs movies!!!
Run On,"From this trailer I got the vibe that he's a rudeass sharp mouthed person lol I dont know why. And not only he wasn't such a man, he had to be COMPLETELY, i repeat ABSOLUTELY COMPLETELY opposite and the softest man in the kdrama world and honey is dripping from his voice 24/7. My guts never did me so wrong."
Run On,this was so good! very funny too actually!
Run On,It's not available in you tube
Run On,I do like Sooyoung's swimsuit in this drama
Run On,Por favor ya está en nexflix Latinoamérica? Saludos desde México 👍🌟🤗🤩❤️
Run On,Will there be a season 2?
Run On,loved how chilled the series was. best ending. no toxic love triangles and all
Run On,I'm so glad I picked up this drama. It has now become one of my favourite shows ever!!
Run On,"Idk why this drama so underrated...I live how the characters are mature and stable.. not dominating ,toxic or cringy..
Love this drama and the characters...✨This drama is definitely for mature minded ppl...."

How To Ruin Christmas,Broooo honestly i never thought South Africans were this good .....am loving every fcking minute of this 😂😂😂😂😂❤️
How To Ruin Christmas,Not the same without my best character. RIP Busy
How To Ruin Christmas,I loved tumi;'s character. i do not know her name but she express tumi's character well
How To Ruin Christmas,I didn't see them honour Busi at the end of their credits like they would Honour any key actors or people key to a project 🤷🏽‍♀️
How To Ruin Christmas,Beauty has got to be the worst character for me throughout the 3 parts
How To Ruin Christmas,"I really love Zuma, buh I miss Busi, she was really a life of the movie, the naughty prodigal daughter, I didn't know she is late 🥺😞
 Shadrack, so sorry for your 🐑😔."
How To Ruin Christmas,"I’ve enjoyed watching this lol, all love from Ireland

Damn I didn’t know that, the girl with no hair passed away😢, I was about to complain that why is she not on the other episodes, she was really funny, RIP Queen"
How To Ruin Christmas,"Okay I'm from Kenya honestly I didn't know Busi Lurayi passed away,I was looking for her in the first episode of season 3 and it finishes without me seeing her.Then I see In loving memory...so sad 😢😭 may she rest in peace."
How To Ruin Christmas,It was good but just wasn't the same.....  R.I.P. Busi 🥹
How To Ruin Christmas,"The best Christmas series ewer!! 
I laughed to tears!!🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Can we hawe mor, and more like this!!!
👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏"
How To Ruin Christmas,"I’m going to miss Busi to much, but this will still blow us away."
How To Ruin Christmas,"Yazi the comments sectionis always just pivotal! My horror and shock to find out that Busi is no more!! He lona?! Le reng?!!! I just searched on the internet, and it has been affirmed!!! July the 10th!! I've relocated therefore totally missed this if it was at one point in the news or whatever back home!!!!!! Bathong guyzini! Hayini nina hleni!!!😱😱😱😱😭😭😭💔💔💔💔💔 She was everything!!! Authentic to Africa and her acting game was just on another level nje, always looked forward to Tumi's scenes! Shockhet!!"
How To Ruin Christmas,👎
How To Ruin Christmas,The trailer felt empty without the main characters 😢 💔 😔
How To Ruin Christmas,They best address Busi Lurayi....this show is not the same without her
How To Ruin Christmas,Can't wait! Glad they continued it!!!
How To Ruin Christmas,I miss Busi omg :(
How To Ruin Christmas,"Really going to miss Tumi, rest in peace Busi"
How To Ruin Christmas,Are you sure Mr. & Mrs. Harry Mountbatten-Windsor aren't part of this movie? They surely know how to ruin Christmas for their family. As long as Netflix continues ANY association with H&M with any rebroadcast of any media  they are involved with I'll continue to boycott this streaming service along with many others.
How To Ruin Christmas,"Tell me why my bf sent this to me excited without looking at the trailer, thinking this was a movie with Nicole Byer in it lol 😂"
Teen Mom 2,"So, not being sleeping around,protecting yourself, make him wear protection is not in the conversation? But we need to vote democrat and protest so we can murder our babies anytime we want?"
Teen Mom 2,What did Leah do to her face?? She looks so different 😮
Teen Mom 2,Can't believe they're teens!! Such beautiful girls 💕
Teen Mom 2,"The girls are so big my son is gonna be 15 this year so unreal he was
My baby"
Teen Mom 2,They grew up so fast! Time flies!
Teen Mom 2,❤️
Teen Mom 2,dam her girls look just like her
Teen Mom 2,Omg
Teen Mom 2,"What an awful advice, tell the girls to never get in a situation like that, use protection, she makes it sound like abortion is not a big deal, somekind of birth control. Btw she needs to stay away from fillers and botox it makes her look older."
Teen Mom 2,Leah is an amazing mother.
Teen Mom 2,"Taking away abortion ""rights""? What the? First off she starting the conversation based on a false premise."
Teen Mom 2,LIFE BEGINS AT CONCEPTION. YOU were 16 and chose to keep them. WHY ARE YOU NOT SEEING THAT LIFE BEGINS AT CONCEPTION. DONT HAVE SEX IF YOU DONT UNDERSTAND  THAT LIFE BEGINS AT CONCEPTION.
Teen Mom 2,1:18
Teen Mom 2,I would really hope they discuss and ask all the children if they're OK talking about these things on camera. I would hate it.
Teen Mom 2,Leah needs to go back to school. I can't believe she's been on TV this long and hasn't got some speech training. Its painful listening to her speak.
Teen Mom 2,"Because Leah aborted Jeremy’s baby when they broke up, then didn’t tell him once they got back together."
Teen Mom 2,🗑 🗑🗑🗑
Teen Mom 2,It’s a Medical right when your life is at risk not a I’m teenage and got pregnant not I can’t afford it. I already knew that and got pregnant.
Teen Mom 2,"All Roe V Wade did was give choice back to each state on what their abortion laws would be and abortions are not used on still born babies. Abortions cause stillborn babies. She is though, a very wonderful, caring mother with very smart girls and has good intentions."
Teen Mom 2,"She talks about abortion but what about birth control methods and STD? 
My God, teach your children how to be responsible!"
The Challenge,If you could the colors it's 8 6 8 and 6 again so I don't know how that works our in the long run because it's not an even pairing between groups
The Challenge,I was hoping AJ from TC UK would’ve been here
The Challenge,I’m not aof Sarah and Ben at all but love that Wes and Theo r back. Think this will be a good season
The Challenge,Producers should bring Jenny in as a surprise when amber leaves due to pregnancy
The Challenge,Justice for Jenny not being not being part of the cast while kaycee is bit weird Theo isn’t shown in the trailer since he is the face everyone is most excited to see
The Challenge,Aye what's on now?? Any seasons on now?
The Challenge,"Maaaan I still love to see people 35 and up put in that work. 35 ain't old, 50 ain't old.  Staying active is what keeps u young. Run fast, lift heaving, keep moving"
The Challenge,"This makes me upset. I already pay 100 bucks for cable to get MTV I don’t have enough for paramount too, shit I got 4 kids! 😭😭"
The Challenge,Not them pairing danny with kiki 🤣🤣🤣
The Challenge,"I don't like them being teamed up with mtv legends, I don't like that. Their getting help from our countrymen🤷🏿what... I'm ready for it tho"
The Challenge,So we are getting world championship first before All stars 4? 😢
The Challenge,Impressive as always sir! Thanks Drew ❤
The Challenge,Maaayn I thought the trailer would be on youtube
The Challenge,C’mon Aussie Aussie Aussie
The Challenge,"I'm excited for the season, but REALLY NOT looking forward to having to watch another season with Sarah...hope she is eliminated early!"
The Challenge,"The opening shot has them wearing shirts according to country. Green: Aussie, Red: UK, Black: USA, Gray: Argentina. I would think they keep those colors throughout the challenge, making some of your guesses on who's in what shot not make sense. No offense intended. Also there are only 6 players on both UK and Argentina. Guess maybe two people do get eliminated up front."
The Challenge,I hope Kaycee does have to go into an elimination against a woman potentially as strong as her. It seems like she skates by because of her BB alliance or her relationship with Nany. No offense but she hasn’t brought any excitement to the show. I know she’s strong and athletic and I want to see her earn her spot in a final.
The Challenge,I’d like to see gus and jerimiah from floribama on the next USA challenge. Gus was nervous af his first time on wow1
The Challenge,"I would have LOVED to have seen AJ from UK over Nathan, he really felt like the main character of the season and a great competitor then got unlucky being colorblind lol, but I cannot say I am upset with the casting overall at all."
The Challenge,I wish the concept was more like WOTW2 .. like is it really global challenge champion if their all paired with USA challengers?
Black Ink Crew New York,Should’ve been canceled the show after what was done to Dutchess and Jada. Tf.
Black Ink Crew New York,I.  Love.    The.  Show.      But.  The.   Drama.    Needs.  To.  Stop.
Black Ink Crew New York,I’ve been watching Trevia on TV since she was the producer for Mary Mary’s show. I hope she and the rest of the cast will be ok in the future 🙏🏾🙏🏾
Black Ink Crew New York,messy ass producer acting like she dont like the drama herself
Black Ink Crew New York,Been a long time coming. 😂👌🏿
Black Ink Crew New York,It’s crazy how many people this show destroyed from season 1 - 9 jumping people fighting every episode see they dnt care about humans at all or maybe it’s cause it’s just because a bunch of minorities lol
Black Ink Crew New York,"He should have been cut off a long time ago no matter how many times in the fucked up situation that he has caused. He fires ppl left and right, he acts like the victim when it comes to his shop; I understand that it's his shop and he wants to make sure it's all good and keep things professional but there are limits. He is very disrespectful to his crew and family. From seeing the episodes I've watched where he and his cousin teddy ambushed/jumped Alex where he could have lost his life but suffered with physical pain to his back. Ceaser and ted basically ruined Alex's career. Then seeing Ceaser beat up his daughter and defends his gf. When ur a parent there is difference between discipline and abuse. Parents should discipline not hit a child. It bewildered me that he wasnt cut off but after showing the video of the dog. Animal abuse is no joke. Nor child abuse. He should have been in anger management classes a long time ago. Its ashame what can happen behind close doors with him. But due to the serious situations of why he got cut off of black ink crew. An animals life matters too just like a child. While may some ppl who agree or disagree but to my honest opinion they both matter to me. But everyone has their own opinions. Such ashame that black ink crew is done but if they ever do make a series again cool if nor then it's over. It was a good show, funny, creative when they did some scenes where tattoos have been done and very emotional. Hopefully the casts is doing alright. 

Due to the situation happened a year or many months ago I just wanted to state my comment.  So...yeah."
Black Ink Crew New York,Why they talking about it like they getting fired from work 🤣🤣💀
Black Ink Crew New York,Show was canceled cause of Cesar beating the dog and his daughter it was not cause of the staff. They’re just using that as an excuse
Black Ink Crew New York,He mistreated everybody in that room
Black Ink Crew New York,Wait the end of the season! They didn’t say show
Black Ink Crew New York,so they canceled the show?
Black Ink Crew New York,"Tati you got fired you still trying to kiss ass like tf! Y’all have so much to say about Donna, sky, Dutch and kit it’s sad. Move on without him some of y’all have shops what y’all need from cease.."
Black Ink Crew New York,Byeeee🤮🚮‼🥱
Black Ink Crew New York,And what does Ted do in the shop nothing get a free check and mess around with non black woman in the shop show should have been gone 🤡🚮🚮‼✌💥
Black Ink Crew New York,Should  been cancelled🤡🚮🛐🛐🛐🛐
Black Ink Crew New York,SKY SAVE BLACK INK CREW !!! Save the show !!
Black Ink Crew New York,"He took EVERYONE'S bag, even the producers."
Black Ink Crew New York,Man they’re ok with violence against a person but when someone spanks their dog it’s the end of the world
Black Ink Crew New York,Yes gonna have to change his name cos how are u gonna be Ceaser when you're the one responsible for bringing down your own damn Empire ta bumba ras bwoy lol
The Sound of Your Heart,"Oh, what a pathetic Mouron"

The Sound of Your Heart,HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA 🤣🤣 Jung So Min really funny though !!! She’s a crackhead like LKS too 😂🤣

Exatlon,"Es la primera vez que veo a Evelyn muy unida a su equipo, y ahora que la veo un poco más distante con Mati por lo de los equipos diferentes, se ponen a funar a Evelyn por qué no apoya a Mati cuando llora, osea quien los entiende o las quieren juntas o separadas no se le puede tener contentos a todos. Menos que le tiren hate a Eve que no se lo merece"
Exatlon,AZULES no se dejen manejar por Mati como el gatito mimoso porque ya lo dijo ella les enseñara las garras 💙💪🏻💙💪🏻💙💪🏻💙💪🏻💙💪🏻💙💪🏻💙💪🏻💙💪🏻esto e s mental AZULES no se dejen engañar. !!!

Exatlon,La verdad que se  valla Natali no se x que la metieron una mujer que no sabe jugar. Pobre marido como la aa guanta que  se balla
Exatlon,"por que siempre se le ve a Fogel que no hace comentarios, como que no le interesa hacer convivencia"
Exatlon,"Venga rojos!!!❤️
Vendrán días buenos."
Exatlon,"Mati deberías darte un descanso y si extrañas mucho a tu familia pues deberías irte eres una buena atleta pero ya no sufras así que ve a casa 

#SiempreAzul💙"
Exatlon,No se ustedes pero yo pienso que alguien  más de los azules se merecía la playera dorada
Exatlon,"Hasta hoy me está gustando la actitud de los 2 equipos, esta vez ni Pato me a caído mal 😂 Espero así sea toda la temporada y que gane el/la mejor 😊 Claro si es un azul estaría mejor 💙💙💙"
Exatlon,"Cómo es posible q Liliana siempre con su sonrisa burlona , habra ganado , pero porq  no tenía rivales . Actitud lamentable aún siendo su vida tan problemática y triste ."
Exatlon,"Verdad que estos azulitos hacen reir ...lo unico que piensan es en hablar mal de los rojos...se despiertan  hablan de los rojos, comen hablan de los rojos, antes de dormir hablan de los rojos, durante el juego hablan de los rojos, pienso que hasta en sus sueños hablan de los rojos y lo peor es que hablan mal...pobre azulitos por eso quedan mal con muchas personas que los ven...FUERZA ROJOS SE PUEDE...💪💝"
Exatlon,Jajaja la mati segun saca a  lili x que dice que son puntos seguros jajaja si como no no siempre gnaras Matilda
Exatlon,Cada que pierde matty extraña a su familia.. Acepta la realidad hoy fueron superiores los azules y mientras el engreído se pato y el malvibroso de Eliud no se dediquen a competir con honestidad y gallardía.. Se los va a seguir llevando el cuerno...
Exatlon,Que pena da esta gente . Que con poca incomodidad ya se sienten frustrados . O dicen extraño a mi familia . Ellos saben al inscribirse para ir a exatlon lo van a vivir y estar alejados de sus familiares . Que difícil es para los seres humanos volver a vivir a lo básico .
Exatlon,Las primeras 2 semanas los azules también la sufrieron pero solo así pudieron reaccionar y volverse más fuertes...💙💙
Exatlon,"Más  acción  menos chisme  y envidias  PARA GANAR  
Y MENOS  AMARGURA Y  DISFRUTAR  LOS  JUEGOS"
Exatlon,"Vamos azules espero que producción no  haga nada en contra para que ganen los rojos, si ganan será por el esfuerzo de cada quien ."

The Return of the Condor Heroes,為了劉亦菲來看的~不過看到郭靖拿雙手劍就冷了~誰不知道郭靖強的是掌法~用雙手劍的郭靖是怎樣???編劇跟導演是有甚麼毛病嗎........
The Return of the Condor Heroes,把楊過釋演的缺根筋，實在不好看，男主角雖帥俊，但演成這樣子，才是悲劇。
The Return of the Condor Heroes,這是那個「天才」，把劉亦菲小龍女的劇照和楊冪王昭君的劇照擺在一起，這不是表明了楊冪在本劇中的表現差劉亦菲很多嗎！

Wild Orchids,"Trolling I can't describe how Great the Vibes were I had to hold on to the person next to me I was Blowing up so Fuking hard, Can't wait for the next  universe journey Peace Love and Wub🙌🏻💯"
Wild Orchids,"""Amethyst in my fist like a switchblade"" 💥"
Wild Orchids,This is such an underrated track.
Wild Orchids,"Keep on keeping on, you are litteraly one of the most talented artists when it comes to this shit. Like dude you're merging reality with something you've created, but at the same time... it feels like something so primitive down to the bone."
Wild Orchids,DMT EXPERIENCE! IMAGINE IF THIS WAS IN 8D! 👀
Wild Orchids,Heard this live yesterday. If you get a chance definitely see him live. Amazing visuals and sound. Best day everrrr!
Wild Orchids,I can listen to this on repeat and never get tired of it
Wild Orchids,LSDREAM been killing it since day one <3

Mystery,"Play War Thunder now with my link, and get a massive, free bonus pack including vehicles, boosters and more: https://playwt.link/theepicnate315"
Mystery,You do the exploring I'm too lazy to do
Mystery,I thought the fallout universe was locked in the 50s theme not 60s?
Mystery,"Thought you were gonna say ""scratch my post apocalyptic balls"""
Mystery,Thank you for this video!!! 💕
Mystery,You are correct in your asssumption Fallout 4 continues. With mods it's got super replay potential. So keep making the videos & I'll keep watching. Heck it's snowing hard outside what else am I going to do? ;p
Mystery,That goofy religion sure sounds like scientology
Mystery,Thanks for all your bethesda secret lore efforts
Mystery,"Hey Nate. Over all I don't mind what game you play and do a video on.

I actually like the videos you make in general. For the way you present and the info you find out.

I look forward to your next video."
Mystery,Heaven's Gate vibes
Mystery,You okay man?
Mystery,"Nate... I'm not picky about the subject... Just don't stop talking. Your voice is very calming, and drowns out the brain thoughts"
Mystery,More pls. Thanks
Mystery,"The ""dead emissary"" encounter is rarer than the living encounter. It's simpler to find the living one and, um, not engage in dialog."
Mystery,The difference between 3 and 4's alien blasters could just be different models. Colt M1911 vs 1903 Pocket Hammer.
Mystery,"The Emissary sounds like a less-human, Fallout version, of the Doctor"
Mystery,"They actually simplified the hidden quest in 76, you just need to get into the Freddy Fear apartment to get the dome key now."
Mystery,It took me like 3 days to entirely watch this video lmao
Mystery,Just say H.sapiens.
Mystery,I like the fact you couldn't hide the laugh in your voice while explaining the teirs
Morning Express,"Just revisiting this video with my dad. We'd watch Robin every day. She and her team brightened our mornings and started our days off on positive notes. With so much negativity in the news right now, we're sorely missing her show!

CNN/HLN lost our family and a few others we know when this happened.  

I wish all those who lost their jobs the best. Robin was gracious and thoughtful in her final signoff. We wish all those who lost their jobs the best and wanted to say thank you again for the years of wholesome honest news!"
Morning Express,What are all the anchors doing now?
Morning Express,Bye Robin...All the Best to  the Best Mornings miss you 😊😇💔
Morning Express,Aww. I missed out. Positive blessings all around HLN!! <3 HLN was my go to for my AM news!!
Morning Express,I miss this program. It should have never been canceled
Morning Express,"Morning Express is the only morning new show worth watching. They reported the news in bite size context and seemed to have fun on the set .  This show should definitely be on.  Warner Brothers is a mess, merging with Discovery even worse."
Morning Express,"CNN HLN you suck. This was a beautiful show with a fantastic staff. Robin i miss you, CNN you are fired. Bad move bad move, guess i have to find a new station and for this i will never forgive you. Robin thank you so much for a wonderful 21 years! Godspeed!"
Morning Express,What a shame. Too bad CNN won’t go away instead.
Morning Express,"""Stellar hands"" - I beg to differ.  Those ""stellar hands"" continuously try to create the narrative, but you and your team had to fall on the sword for it.  We will miss your news without analysis.  We will miss your salutes. We will miss you all.  Take care."
Morning Express,"Fucking miss her, the whole group. God"
Morning Express,Ain't no sunshine when she's gone. Wishing Robin and the crew the best on new adventures. Made my morning watching
Morning Express,Robin and Bob were the only I reason why I watched CNN. I am and forever be In Love with Jennifer Westhoven. The network is trash now. I am NOT watching it again. Thanks Crappy News Network for screwing up millions of morning routines.
Morning Express,"I loved waking up to Robin Meade and the rest of the gang! Never liked CNN and their news channel, so will now look elsewhere because taking such class off tv, will definitely not be worth my time.  Good luck to all of you. 😢"
Morning Express,"What a drag!!  I looked forward to this show every morning 4am my time, Mrs. Meades is gonna be missed!!  😔"
Morning Express,"Wow. I was getting up in the morning and kept seeing Forensic files and was like ‘damn, I woke up too late’. I miss this show"
Morning Express,*She DUMPED ON TRUMP wayyyyyy to many times and TRUMP'S Friend bought the Network* 😂😎🚬👍🏼 *should have kept her opinions to herself*
Morning Express,She will be dead within 3 years of a painful debilitating ailment for manipulating the less fortunate with hidden pervert cameras.Satan will strike get down and take her soul.Mark my words.within 3 years
Morning Express,hln/cnn/warner bros really messed up. this was THE best morning show that ive ever watched. colleagues and friends agree and LOVED Robin--watching this show was part of my (and our) morning ritual. watching cnn with don lemon just isnt the same. we're slammed with political opinions from every angle at 6am by don lemon and his counterparts--a way less enjoyable way to start my day :/
Morning Express,"cute  Robins    "" Boss"""
Morning Express,so i havent had cable in a while and here i am clicking on HLN to see robin meade and friends i kept saying wait a min they still on break until i google when will robin meade be back from break to only find out this show has not been on since dec 5 now im crying i loved watching this news channel thank you for all the years and love you show us there no other like you all  I pray for whatever comes your way be sucessful. Im going to miss yall so much now i got to find someone else to brighten my morning but wait there isnt lol again thank you!!!! Now i have to go grieve 😇😇😇😇

The Golden Pillow,"Hi, can you upload chinese drama ""Brave New World"" (新阿郎) starring Alex Man and Fann Wong, please."
The Golden Pillow,"Really unusual for me to see Alex Man on a Singaporean TV show. To Hongkongers like me, he is known for his appearances on many TVB series. I actually didn't know he took roles on SBC/TCS/Mediacorp drama series until recently."
The Golden Pillow,"my fave show during my teenage time, really bring back memory"

The Surgeons Cut,hat's off to Dr. Devi Prasad Shetty
The Surgeons Cut,@0:32 Huge respect and love to devi sir
The Surgeons Cut,Absolutely
The Surgeons Cut,Seems good ...but the worst movie ever
The Surgeons Cut,Doctor's Are Like God. ❤️
The Surgeons Cut,Dr Kypros is a badass and the best gynecologist so far🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏 he is also born and raised in paphos like me😎😎😎 I adore him 😍😍😍 I cant wait to finish and go work with him in England 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
The Surgeons Cut,omg!!! the first episode itself 😦
The Surgeons Cut,I hope that one day i will also become a great surgeon🤞💯 and will be able to help needy people in getting  treatment at affordable prices just like Dr. Devi prasad shetty💯
The Surgeons Cut,Span Chirurgi
The Surgeons Cut,just mute this trailer and play like a surgeon over it
The Surgeons Cut,When people ask me why I'm not religious I'll tell them to watch this Docuseries.
The Surgeons Cut,Massive respect to all surgeons out there. What you do is truly incredible.
The Surgeons Cut,"My identical twin boys are turning 3 in May due to Kypros, he performed laser ablation surgery on me and my boys at 17 weeks gestation. We had Stage 3 Twin to Twin Transfusion Syndrome. Looking back now it is truly amazing this surgery exists as without treatment my boys would have died."
The Surgeons Cut,Dr Devi Shetty = King of Hearts ❤️
The Surgeons Cut,"This is an excellent documentary featuring 4 doctors with a BBC production quality standard - need to say no more. The 4 docs shown are the best of the best of the best of the best, not only in what they do but the lives they live. I have to say that the first surgeon who operates babies inside the mother´s belly and the third surgeon - a woman - who I think invented the method of cutting the liver of a live donor (liver regenerates itself) and transplanting that 2/3 of the liver into the recipient - are the most breathtaking to me.  The second story of the illegal immigrant who became one of the best brain surgeons in the country is also amazing, and the fourth story is incredible. Netflix keeps on coming with these high-quality documentaries, and I am getting addicted!!!"
The Surgeons Cut,"Great documentary. Looking forward to see a documentary on Nurses as they are also work hand in hand with the Doctors and more contact with patients ❤️
Kudos all the healthcare people"
The Surgeons Cut,"""When you see a virtuoso perform, you just know it"". Perfect..sums it all for me"
The Surgeons Cut,There's Dr Devi shetty my idol
The Surgeons Cut,Doctors are the heroes ... Everyone should respect them for what they do..They sacrifice their family time just for patients...We salute them...May Allah bless them.
The Surgeons Cut,Me 😅

Babel,👉Spotify Playlist  : https://open.spotify.com/playlist/3os7OYySH1hfmjgBEJtga4
Babel,You know the remix is good when it gots more views than the original song
Babel,Song = mood relax
Babel,"For me this song is reminding the moment, when the beautiful memories from the past met the awesome possibilities in the future"
Babel,"the girl in the preview is obviously under the hard drugs! so young and already forever broken, most likely deliberately and lost for life, doomed to slowly die! tragedy!
девушка на превью очевидно под кайфом! такая юная и уже навсегда сломленная, скорее всего намерянно и потерянная для жизни, обречённая медленно умирать! трагедия!"
Babel,Мотив полностью слизан с Чеченского «дечк пондар»
Babel,Good 👍🔥
Babel,Dayummm 🔥 those chills 🥶
Babel,🇦🇿🇵🇰🇹🇷
Babel,Sounds good riding my mtn bike.
Babel,Babel music
Babel,Coming from otnicka where are you really this  .pice is in my  alarm ⏰ ringtone  Friday 17 2023  17/02/2023 night 01:32am.  Mid night ❤️
Babel,"Does anyone know, what the song at the end is?"
Babel,"OK, please help me find a song like this one! It sounds like this one, with the guitar, but it is much faster. I don't know how else to explain it. It is a dance/house/trance? type of music."
Babel,🌞♥️🌞♥️🌞♥️💥💞♥️💥♥️💞♥️💥🌞♥️SB
Babel,I really like this music. It is awesome

The War of the Worlds,I want a War of the Worlds movie/series that strictly adheres to the book.
The War of the Worlds,I loved! I don't know why such a low rating!
The War of the Worlds,Project blue beam
The War of the Worlds,Love this.
The War of the Worlds,How did I miss this?... I never even knew about it... It actually looks kind of cool. It looks like they stuck to the original late 1800s version from H.G. Wells.
The War of the Worlds,"Part 1 & 2 were ok apart from the Main characters being in front of martians & being the last to get away, but miraculously never get hit as all around burst into flames. Part 3 was a miss, full of dumb character decisions that left the ending rather flat."
The War of the Worlds,"When you uploaded a scene from the movie, with “👽” this emoji, and then “💥” this emoji, I really thought that it was a parody.
 
Note to BBC: I don’t know If I fell in love with the person who thought of using them, or if I despise those very fingers who thought of using them."
The War of the Worlds,Interesting scientific series!.👏🏻
The War of the Worlds,"A shitty feminazi version masquerading as a period piece. Absolute waste of time. Never let the BBC writing staff within 50 miles of an original story, or they'll wreck it. Same as they did with W. J. Burley books and Reginald Hill's Dalziel and Pascoe novels. If you're here for a faithful retelling, don't waste your time. They took the original story and boned it up the arse."
The War of the Worlds,British using gatlings instead of maxims?
The War of the Worlds,Is it on any other streaming service as well? Really wanna watch this.
The War of the Worlds,"If anyone here knows a movie that kinda similar to this but , there is a scene in that movie that the spaceships tries to bomb on something red that consumes or invades like earth I dunno if that was exactly it but apparently that was I only remember , please please do tell me , what the title of that movie , that is betwwen 2011 to 2015 movie and kinda A good one but Had only watched that one time that I can't remember what's the other details so if anyone across my comment knows that movie please comment , thank you I will appreciate it whole heartedly."
The War of the Worlds,oh nooo..another similar movie to the others???? stop stop stop pleassseeee
The War of the Worlds,Elennor Tomlinson after she done with this should go to Doctor who.
The War of the Worlds,10в ку
The War of the Worlds,I love this adaptation!  👍
The War of the Worlds,Oh please was perfect
The War of the Worlds,This is my favourite series
The War of the Worlds,This was so boring lol

World on Fire,Love this style of music so relaxing.
World on Fire,Ну ты чего? Оставь лайк!
World on Fire,"This is REALLY good, and that Pandora's Box backing beat has me extra chuffed"
World on Fire,"Pretty prophetic. God's prophets may not have shared the same message through Reggae, but we've been warned it's coming."
World on Fire,Welcome to more fire in the World😵
World on Fire,Great song!💙🎵
World on Fire,"Your fans are real. From word of mouth met a decent dude to mention stick figure...ever since I been hooked! To this day I'm thankful for this guy, but no longer communicate. Your fans are the shit!!"
World on Fire,nice chanel. found ya through food forest permacutlure. cheers!
World on Fire,Nice
World on Fire,"Listen to the song ""Snoop Lion - la la la"" and tell me it's not the same melody :D Love both songs!"
World on Fire,I love this song and the music I listen to every day.
100 Days My Prince,"Mr Queen is worse. Flower Crew is so cringe.
I actually enjoyed the ML. He can say so much with his eyes and subtle facial expressions. To me, that takes skill.
A lot of Kdramas start out terrible and don’t settle down until a few episodes in.
This year, I haven’t found anything worth watching other than to just past the time.
The last good series I watched was Alchemy of Souls and U see the Queen’s Umbrella. Vicenzo and Crash Landing on You are probably my favorites.
So I rewatch better kdramas rather than watching the teen/young adult crazies that there seems to be an abundance for young viewers."
100 Days My Prince,"The acting of this show probably is one of the worst I seen. Lee Yool and Yoon yi-seo have no chemistry together, so their love story seems shallow and they are always bickering about something stupid 🙄. The supporting cast are uninteresting and silly. The director tried to make this into a comedy drama but the comedy was cringe and and not funny. Bad acting all around.  I will rate it 1 out 5.  The Crowned Clown was so good compared to this terrible show!"
100 Days My Prince,Me gusta mucho como sus amigos les quieren mucho Son humildes y amorosos
100 Days My Prince,Definitely this drama deserves a award!!A real package!
100 Days My Prince,"She is so mean. No wonder no one married her. She even takes advantage of the Prince.
She would have made a terrible concubine."
100 Days My Prince,This drama that made me meet EXO🥰💕
100 Days My Prince,"I love this drama. Everyone's interpretation was actually really, really good, but D.O. put on a show apart. His micro facial expressions made me laugh and cry in equal measure. And what a beautiful voice...OMG.💘😭😂😍💕"
100 Days My Prince,My favorite 😍 💓
100 Days My Prince,"Wow heart touching drama I lv it ,D.O  u r a good singer & good actor also all the best future Drama's & Album's, but y clips I hope I can see all Episode's. Love u D.O💞🥰😘😘"
100 Days My Prince,"Does someone knows the words in Korean he says up to 1.37 ?? I really want to know how to write it in Korean but I can't really translate his words into it 
Thanks a lot"
100 Days My Prince,needed a flash forward at the palace. would be nice to see them married and BOTH in nice clothes with the prince presenting her with the cherry blossom shoes he promised her 🥰
100 Days My Prince,"I just finish watching this on Netflix and I really love it! All characters are awesome and all great Actors and Actress even extras! Directors and producers and also fashion everyone did a great job! Crown Prince love for her was amazing beautiful! There is times I do not believe in love but watching this and other Dramas think there is love that do exist. Every Chinese n Korea Drama I watch the men act As a crown prince, a king, and even General most their love shows example of how true love should be there’s times is true n other times not cause people has a different way of showing wats love is. Do kyungsoo that plays crown prince he awesome and great Actor great singer I also big fan of EXO. The Characters that plays group friends in villages like family is great to have those friends that you can trust that’s shows loyalty and be the one you can most count on. This Drama is beautiful, love, sad, loyalty, betrayal, sacrifice most of all happiness. I am such big fan! Wish to have autograph and meet all you guys just to shake your hands and pictures. Sending lots love! God bless!❤️"
100 Days My Prince,THIS SHOW IS HOW I GOT INTO EXO AHSHBSJDMSLKDS
100 Days My Prince,OMG my favorite episode!!! 1st tine watching this
100 Days My Prince,What a well-written romance story!  The prince was an ideal lover whose dedication has not changed since they were children.  The girl was ordinary but a strong woman.  Hat off to the writers and the acting crew!  I actually hated every emperor drama with many concubines .  I never found them romantic.
100 Days My Prince,"season TWO, WEDDING>>"
100 Days My Prince,Um is no one going to talk about how her friend is obviously pregnant but somehow managed to get onto that roof?
100 Days My Prince,Explained in tamil vj voice

Graceful Family,"PROPHECIES RECEIVED FROM AN OLD WOMAN OF 90 YEARS – 4 keys to the timing of Christ’s return
.
Prophecies given long ago in Norway An old woman of 90 from Valdres in Norway had a vision from God in 1968. The evangelist Emanuel Minos had meetings (services) where she lived. He had the opportunity to meet her, and she told him what she had seen. He wrote it down, but thought it to be so unintelligible that he put it in a drawer. Now, almost 30 years later, he understands he has to share the vision with others.
The woman from Valdres was a very alert, reliable, awake and credible Christian, with a good reputation among all who knew her. This is what she saw:
“I saw the time just before the coming of Jesus and the outbreak of the Third World War. I saw the events with my natural eyes. I saw the world like a kind of a globe and saw Europe, land by land. I saw Scandinavia. I saw Norway. I saw certain things that would take place just before the return of Jesus, and just before the last calamity happens, a calamity the likes of which we have never before experienced.
She mentioned four waves:
1. “First before Jesus comes and before the Third World War breaks out there will be a ‘détente’ like we have never had before. There will be peace between the super powers in the east and the west, and there will be a long peace. (Remember, that this was in 1968 when the cold war was at its highest. E. Minos) In this period of peace there will be disarmament in many countries, also in Norway and we are not prepared when it (the war) comes. The Third World War will begin in a way no one would have anticipated – and from an unexpected place.
2. “A lukewarmness without parallel will take hold of the Christians, a falling away from true, living Christianity. Christians will not be open for penetrating preaching. They will not, like in earlier times, want to hear of sin and grace, law and gospel, repentance and restoration. There will come a substitute instead: prosperity (happiness) Christianity.
“The important thing will be to have success, to be something; to have material things, things that God never promised us in this way. Churches and prayer houses will be emptier and emptier. Instead of the preaching we have been used to for generations -like, to take your cross up and follow Jesus, – entertainment, art and culture will invade the churches where there should have been gatherings for repentance and revival. This will increase markedly just before the return of Jesus.
3. “There will be a moral disintegration that old Norway has never experienced the likes of. People will live together like married without being married. (I do not believe the concept ‘co-habitor’? existed in 1968 – E. Minos.) Much uncleanness before marriage, and much infidelity in marriage will become the natural (the common), and it will be justified from every angle. It will even enter Christian circles and we pet it – even sin against nature. Just before Jesus return there will be TV- programs like we have never experienced. (TV had just arrived in Norway in 1968. E. Minos)
“TV will be filled with such horrible violence that it teaches people to murder and destroy each other, and it will be unsafe in our streets. People will copy what they see. There will not be only one ‘station’ on TV, it will be filled with ‘stations.’ (She did not know the word ‘channel’ which we use today. Therefore she called them stations. E. Minos.) TV will be just like the radio where we have many ‘stations,’ and it will be filled with violence. People will use it for entertainment. We will see terrible scenes of murder and destruction one of the other, and this will spread in society. Sex scenes will also be shown on the screen, the most intimate things that takes place in a marriage.” (I protested and said, we have a paragraph that forbids this kind of thing. E. Minos.) There the old woman said: “It will happen, and you will see it. All we have had before will be broken down, and the most indecent things will pass before our eyes.”
4. “People from poor countries will stream to Europe. (In 1968 there was no such thing as immigration. E. Minos.) They will also come to Scandinavia – and Norway. There will be so many of them that people will begin to dislike them and become hard with them. They will be treated like the Jews before the Second World War. Then the full measure of our sins will have been reached (I protested at the issue of immigration. I did not understand it at the time. E. Minos.)
The tears streamed from the old woman’s eyes down her cheeks. “I will not see it, but you will. Then suddenly, Jesus will come and the Third World War breaks out. It will be a short war.” (She saw it in the vision.)
“All that I have seen of war before is only child’s play compared to this one, and it will be ended with a nuclear atom bomb. The air will be so polluted that one cannot draw one’s breath. It will cover several continents, America, Japan, Australia and the wealthy nations. The water will be ruined (contaminated?). We can no longer till the soil. The result will be that only a remnant will remain. The remnant in the wealthy countries will try to flee to the poor countries, but they will be as hard on us as we were on them.
“I am so glad that I will not see it, but when the time draws near, you must take courage and tell this. I have received it from God, and nothing of it goes against what the Bible tells.
“The one who has his sin forgiven and has Jesus as Savior and Lord, is safe.” Jesus our savior is coming back Repent now before it's too late to get ready to meet him in heaven."

So don't treat me bad if I'm feeling sad, alright?
Please don't be mad if I don't smile back, alright?
If I fuck up my words, don't think I'm absurd, alright?
Alright?
I'm physically exhausted
Tired of my knuckles beating
I'm chewing gum to pass this time of sadness
Can't you see it?
You're too busy seeking selfish wishes
Don't care how I'm feeling
You write me up and say it's love
And I can't believe it
Baby, can you meet me tonight in detention?
I can feel your blood pressure rise, fuck this tension
Let me crawl up into your mind, did I mention?
Pretending everything's alright is detention
De-de-detention
De-de-detention
Pretending everything's alright is (shh)
The teachers don't care about me
Fuck how I feel as long as I make money
They let them do whatever they want to me
They're the customer, I'm chopped meat
I'm chopped meat
I'm physically exhausted
Tired of my knuckles beating
I'm chewing gum to pass this time of sadness

I can feel your blood pressure rise, fuck this tension

Pretending everything's alright is detention
Tonight, I can feel your blood pressure rise

Selena: The Series,We'll all be crying knowing how this series will end.
Selena: The Series,I wouldn’t be able to watch this because I cannot see Christian Serratos as any other character besides Rosita from The Walking Dead. It would be hard to take her seriously playing Selena!
Selena: The Series,"They should have brought back Edward James Olmos as Selena's Father, his performance brought a lot to the table in the movie."
Selena: The Series,"Selena Gomez (Ana De Armas) 
Katy Perry (Jamie Alexander)  
Alejandro Guzman (Jamie Campbell) he killed Selena Gomez she’s dead at Age 22 Years Old"
Selena: The Series,"Why was this series created when a great movie with perfect casting has already been made? This woman looks nothing like Selena and can't act. The tacky wigs, poor acting and ridiculous script is an insult to the legacy of Selena. Please let her rest in peace. 🙏🙏🙏💕"
Selena: The Series,SELENA🕊🕊🕊🕊🕊🕊🕊🕊🕊
Selena: The Series,"Personal opinion, J Lo plays a better Selena. Just watched it again for the first time in years. The resemblance is spooky. I remember the day it happened 😞 I remember the standoff between yulonda and the police. Didn't expect after all these years to cry so much watching this. Her music and smile are forever in my heart."
Selena: The Series,"So I’m not sure if I’ll get banned for this, but being in California and not wanting to spend $293 on ticket made me look into other options. CinemaVariety is wonderful and just for $8/mo."
Selena: The Series,"Her dad got on my FAWKIN NERVES. Her family suffocated the shit out of her. I would have cut my family out, i wouldve took care of them but from a distance because they really suffocated her by treating her like music was her only life! Shit sad and it always ends bad for people who dictate their children’s lives."
Selena: The Series,"Selena não era negra, oxeeee."
Selena: The Series,Meanwhile the killer will be eligible for parole in 2025
Selena: The Series,Nonononono
Selena: The Series,A friend of mine who sang in a band in Baton Rouge met her to sing with her cause Selena was a cool home girl...but she was 'Hit'..look at the design on her black top with the ribbons across her chest in the form of the 5 pointed demon star...God Bless You Sweet Reina..she didn't care what color you were Minorities should stick together..cause there are more brown and black people in this world..Viva la paz!!!! Right on!!!🎼🎹🎶🎉
Selena: The Series,"O livro do Cris que deveria ser a série.
Ele a apoiava em tudo e isso não foi mostrado na série,ficou mesmo aparecendo a imagem que a família Quintanilla tinha dele e não a realidade do fato.
Não mostrou tbm como Selena era forte e teria uma grande personalidade ,ficou parecendo que ela era a que aceitava tudo do pai sem reclamar,coisa impossível para todos os mortais ahahaha"
Selena: The Series,I can sing as bobby brown
Selena: The Series,this is just 1997 the movie
Selena: The Series,That woman looks nothing like Selena.
Selena: The Series,"Selena and Aaliyah, both gone to soon"
Selena: The Series,"The acting was already so good, they should've got a dance double but who looks better in Selena's costumes for Christian because that's where the series is getting ruined."
Selena: The Series,"In my opinion, Christian's portrayal was too sweet and captured Selena's amazing core values and being relatable because she was so easy to reach out to. But I've seen Selena being goofy too. She was sweet but goofy all the time."
Bhaag Beanie Bhaag,"Koi btayga kya , ki last me Arun kya help mangta hai Binny ki frnd ?"

Alien Worlds,"As a stoner, I love this show"
Alien Worlds,"OK this has been out since 2020, WHY CAN I NOT BUY A DVD!?!?!  yes, some of us old people (old people with MONEY) still like to OWN physical media!"
Alien Worlds,Really want a second season.
Alien Worlds,Is this supposed to be a documentary?  May I remind you that documentary films are based on observations that are documented?  This has nothing to do with authenticity.  This is plain science fiction lie.  And this floating robot you stole the idea from the Super men movie. Trashcan
Alien Worlds,The guy in this series is a Conspiracy Theorist. He’s a denier. Conspiracy deniers are Conspiracy Theorists.
Alien Worlds,It would be nice if you guys were using practical efforts to make the aliens.
Alien Worlds,"If we get destroyed by AI, then definately they are gonna go after the Aliens on other planets. Lets just hope AI wont take over the galexy by regarding biological creatures as a threat to its survival."
Alien Worlds,"To everyone crying and whining about it showing more Earth than the CGI planets, it's a documentary not a science fiction movie, watch Avatar if you want that. And for the little CGI we get, it looks amazing, I love the quality over quantity. Just deal with it."
Alien Worlds,"The CGI is really good and the alien species look so real. I love that music by the way!
I'm really excited."
Alien Worlds,Great if you want to watch 2 min intervals of what it's supposed to be about then have to skip forward 8 mins of earth guff every episode. Should have just put it in one
Alien Worlds,Loved this miniseries so much! I hope season 2 is in the making.
Alien Worlds,Season 2?
Alien Worlds,PLS SEASON 2
Alien Worlds,Alien Worlds? More like Planet Earth but with Aliens…….one of the most disappointing things to have come out in 2020
Alien Worlds,Aliens taking a gander at earth from ufo: *car lock sound*
Alien Worlds,Where’s season 2?
Alien Worlds,"Sorry I just couldn't get into the show. They keep switching from the CGI world back to our world to show real world examples of trait or behaviour or animal feature and it's just very jarring, they need to stay in the CGI world more like the discovery one that was made years ago."
Alien Worlds,I don’t get it
Alien Worlds,Pls Hindi Dubbed
Alien Worlds,Two important facts we have no correct answers:  Do aliens life exist other solar systems in Miky Way galaxy and how many stars are there in Miky Way galaxy?  I hope someone has the correct answers and wins the Nobel Prize.

The Bachelorette,"Time now for a recap of Bachelor Nation on ABC and Jesse Palmer the recent host who said he was the bachelor before Clayton Echard as the new ones welcomed Gabby and Rachelle as the bachelorette but Katlin Bristowe was suppose to be the new host as the bachelorette, too. Well, now Deanna Pappas can try to host the bachelorette in the future. Now we all know from Rachel & Gabby where these men will go with The Bachelorettes for two dates."

The Holiday Movies That Made Us,This is an excellent documentary series.
The Holiday Movies That Made Us,Not the same since they change narrators
The Holiday Movies That Made Us,Season 2 I want you to cover Rudolph (1964)
The Holiday Movies That Made Us,"I seriously hope Neflix covers more holiday movies with this show, it's is a wonderful premise, and I'd love to take a deeper look at the making of other holiday classics!"
The Holiday Movies That Made Us,"Honestly, the comments during the Die Hard episode about toxic masculinity is garbage. Also, Lethal Weapon came out a year before Die Hard and yet they act like they invented action without a muscle-bound star at the center, etc. I love Die Hard, but come on ..."
The Holiday Movies That Made Us,"What just 2 episodes??,   I thought we were going to get at least 4 episodes from the last: Movies That Made Us"
The Holiday Movies That Made Us,"The female narrator in this show is so nauseating i had to turn it off, pity cause i wanted to watch it 👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻"
The Holiday Movies That Made Us,"One of the worst edited shows I've seen and it could have been so great. It's like the editor was on PCP and told ""do not let 10 seconds pass without changing the shot or inserting someone else's voice."".  So annoying to watch and barely got through it. Was hoping we were past the worst of the old ""MTV editing"" style but seems this wanted to take the cake."
The Holiday Movies That Made Us,Wtf? The editing was bonkers and the narrator’s voice interrupted people mid sentence to add nothing of value. The actual content was interesting.
The Holiday Movies That Made Us,If only they did the Jim Carry's How The Grinch Stole Christmas episode or maybe The Polar Express.
The Holiday Movies That Made Us,Why the change of narrator?
The Holiday Movies That Made Us,Why not just call it the Christmas movies that made us. It’s not like they’re gonna cover a Hanukkah movie.
The Holiday Movies That Made Us,"In documentary film class day 1, you’re told that when making a documentary, you use voiceover to give you basic facts, then your interview subjects are giving you their unique insight into previously stated facts. It may be formulaic and a bit generic, but if the goal of a documentary is to translate information in a palatable way to people who might not be familiar with the documentary’s subject matter, this formula is hugely effective. This series throws those conventions out of the window in the absolute worst way possible. This is easily one of the most frustrating documentaries I have ever watched- you have one of the most revolutionary movies ever created in Nightmare Before Christmas, with a cast of interviewees who had a big hand in making the thing- and present the information in the absolute most confusing un-digestible way possible. It fees like the director/editor of this documentary were living on a diet exclusively made up of of red bull laced with crushed up Ritalin whilst making this. Like they’ve never heard of the simple technique of giving interview comments a bit of space to breathe so people can, you know, digest what they just heard? 

What you’re left with is an assault of being spoken at at 100 miles per hour for 44 minutes that feel more like an exhausting conversation at a house party at 2am with an irritating person on cocaine telling you their big ideas to open a tequila bar in Miami someday. Netflix, I’ve been an editor for 13 years and am willing to help out on any projects you might be thinking of taking in this direction.
Cheers"
The Holiday Movies That Made Us,The editing is so annoying
The Holiday Movies That Made Us,"What a rip off, two episodes and Elf? Seriously? They choose that movie over a Christmas Story bullshit"
The Holiday Movies That Made Us,"Only 2 episodes, come on Netflix"
The Holiday Movies That Made Us,The editing on this show is so irritating.
The Holiday Movies That Made Us,Netflix should make a documentrie called the baseball cards that made us.
The Holiday Movies That Made Us,"Omgggg, im so excited!!!"
The Holiday Movies That Made Us,"they have a home alone episode on netlfix called the “movies that made us”. along with ghostbusters, die hard, and dirty dancing"
Are You The One,Which AYTO season was your favorite?
Are You The One,Kaylen the type of girl to think that she can “save a guy from himself” then she starts saying “I can’t believe you pushed me” what did you think he was going to do😭😭
Are You The One,gio is so corny
Are You The One,Say what you want about that Guido scalli dude but John was low key abusive and showed red flags straight up. He’s one of those nerdy dude that starts going to the gym and because he starts getting attention from women he thinks he knows how to behave like there’s no one likes you not because you’re nerdy it’s because you’re fucking toxic.
Are You The One,Bro code?
Are You The One,Omg I love when Ryan catches an attitude with these crazies lol
Are You The One,Gio is a PSYCHO
Are You The One,Gio was the worst
Are You The One,What’s funny is that the other guy threw Stephen down 😂
Are You The One,"Gio, that third eye of yours is well behaved. good on you proving that your third eye is bullshit."
Are You The One,Who ended being devins Match again ?!
Are You The One,Devin too funny

Are You The One,Who is the buff guy in a blue shirt with golden skin....I need to know his name🥺...can someone plse tell me his name
Are You The One,This fool said “ love octagon”
Are You The One,"Sooooo, Connor was arrested last year for  - best case - statutory r*pe of a 16 year old (he was 31). The news report is a little unclear if it was forcible or not but even if it wasn't it's illegal and gross.

Really sucks bc he has always been one of my favourite cast members. Chelsea and Kayla dodged a bullet with him 😬 Him calling Kayla inappropriate and immature on the show is very ironic though."
Are You The One,Worst people in this shows history are Gio from season 4 and Zak from season 7.
Are You The One,11:55 what did you expect going in the middle of a fight of men looking 6 feet dumbass 😭

Princess Sarah,Ce générique là est bien plus beau que le français
Princess Sarah,watashi wa ilies desu
Princess Sarah,Ma mère le gâtait depuis qu'elle était tout petit et moi j'adore ce dessin animé je le gaite tout le temps

Princess Sarah,Pourquoi c'est pas le même générique en français
Princess Sarah,Met plus de chanson stp hana no sasayaki et ma chanson prefere☺
Princess Sarah,"Notre enfance à tous,et aussi l'enfance de nos parents 💖"

Scent of Love,for some odd reason this sounds like this would be from jojos bizzare adventure
Scent of Love,💘💖💖💗💗💓💓💋💋💋💋😘😘😘😘😚😚
Scent of Love,Bayonetta 1 has the best soundtrack out of all games you cannot change my mind
Scent of Love,I feel like this is more rosa theamed in everyway or the song balder heard when he saw rosa through witch time ❤
Scent of Love,I don't like romance songs but I'll accept this.
Scent of Love,I want a version sung by Patchy the pirate called Scent of Love - Patchyslot
Scent of Love,"The fact that Bayo got turned into a pachinko abomination makes me sad to no end, but this fucking banger makes up for it"
Scent of Love,Should've just used this as the new theme...
Scent of Love,can we all agree this is a song about jeanne and bayo 🏳️‍🌈
Scent of Love,"""girl that stinks good"""

Scent of Love,Jeanne and Bayonetta song omg
Scent of Love,"People without brain (also slaves living in the Matrix world): ""The boycott of Bayonetta 3 is actually increasing the sales. Jennifer Hale's statements, PlatinumGames's reports and mainstream's media (Covid came from Pangolin, Russia is our enemy, ...) are 100% accurate. I will buy the game without having doubts about it"".

People with brain (living in the real world): ""Those things (The Cabal, Twitter's bootlickers, ...) want us to believe these kinds of nonsense. We are not stupid to fall for it""."
Scent of Love,bensen brought me here

Gibiate,is 2006 coming back or something? that cg
Gibiate,"Nếu bạn đọc được bình luận này, bố mẹ bạn sẽ qua đời trong vòng 5 năm nữa. Để thoát khỏi lời nguyền này, bạn cần phải sao chép nó và dán nó vào năm bộ phim hoạt hình khác. Tôi xin lỗi, tôi xin lỗi, xin hãy tha thứ cho tôi, tôi cũng bị ép buộc"
Gibiate,"It's pretty bad when a viewer lasts for just 1 minute out of a 3 minute trailer. Wow. I've rarely been so underwhelmed, guys. Good job."
Gibiate,The only good thing is the soundtrack
Gibiate,You know that the editor of this was drawing blanks when he spent this long just promoting the music.
Gibiate,Feel like I wasted my life watching this
Gibiate,trash 3D and CGI
Gibiate,Makes me wanna watch ex-arm
Gibiate,"Who else is here because they saw it in the ""worst anime of 20202"" list?"
Gibiate,I won't put any expectation in Crunchyroll again
Gibiate,Where's the animation
Gibiate,Fun fact: this and Ex-Arm are the only TV anime on MAL to have a score below a 4
Gibiate,Ex arm enters the battle
Gibiate,I'll definitely watch it when it comes out
Gibiate,I mean I’ll still watch it but I was really  looking forward to a Vampire Hunter D series.. not samurai vs alien bugs..
Gibiate,Still better than Berserk 2016
Gibiate,The poor voice acting mixed with that botched animation just makes this even harder to watch.
Gibiate,"Hey this actually looks really co-

Sees MAL rating. (not kidding here)
3.96

........Oh no."
Gibiate,The anime is so bad that its so good
Gibiate,More brainwashing and propaganda.
A Very English Scandal,This was just brilliant.  Hugh and Ben equally magnificent.
A Very English Scandal,it is the same as one were sailing around cuba with five bronzed seamen and a childless blonde ballerina...
A Very English Scandal,"Amazeballs. Truly a masterpiece all around.  Surprisingly impressed by Hugh Grant's performance so much so I would like to see him in another ""scandalous"" drama.  Here's an interesting idea, I would like to see him play the role of a Catholic cardinal or bishop with a ""scandalous"" past (the robe would suit him well having seen him in Paddington 2)."
A Very English Scandal,where's Anna Scott when you need her..lol
A Very English Scandal,Super movie - Hugh Grant at his best
A Very English Scandal,the boy with the thorpe in his side
A Very English Scandal,Hugh grant plays a cad a change
A Very English Scandal,Disgusting show & theme. So perverse. I made it through 20 minutes then  grabbed the remote.
A Very English Scandal,The writing or the script was absolutly brilliant. The actors were extraordinary
A Very English Scandal,This was absolutely brilliant
A Very English Scandal,"I remember these events, this seems like a very accurate and honest representation of what happened , allowing for the fact it was a drama. Hugh grant shows he is much more than the bumbling posh boy of romantic movies. Brilliant acting."
A Very English Scandal,This shows Hugh grant as a brilliant serious actor.
A Very English Scandal,This is so British...just watching the trailer made my teeth turn yellow.
A Very English Scandal,the sound is not good I am quite disappointed
A Very English Scandal,Hugh Grant is amazing in this. I didn’t really think much of H.G but Im a fan after watching this
A Very English Scandal,the sound is not good I am quite disappointed
A Very English Scandal,Paddington gang represent
A Very English Scandal,Absolutely brilliant..watched the whole series on Prime Video
A Very English Scandal,"This could easily work as a wholeass sequel to Maurice(1987) seeing how Clive’s political career progressed him to the British Parliament and he finally came in terms with his sexuality after losing Maurice for good.

EPIC SHIT—"
A Very English Scandal,Just finished the book by John Preston this drama was based on... highly recommend as goes into more detail...
Deliver Us,baGOEUKARH
Deliver Us,":54 I don't know why, but this is my favorite visual in the whole film. There's something so simple yet profound about another person offering a hand in need to a suffering soul."
Deliver Us,"this is my favorite movie to date, always will be"
Deliver Us,"We are all slaves, endlessly building monuments and idols empty of meaning, empty of purpose. 

Deliver us."
Deliver Us,What service industry workers go through to get a crappy paycheck from a horrible middle eastern person
Deliver Us,such a masterpiece
Deliver Us,"Fathers work on temple and statues,  walk home at night just to find their sons death, tragic."
Deliver Us,I will show this movie to my children.
Deliver Us,Ha Shem-The Name
Deliver Us,"It was pretty sad to watch as a little girl, but now I'm a mother it completely breaks my heart to imagine what Moses' mother went through."
Deliver Us,This intro is immaculate
Deliver Us,God is Good
Deliver Us,"Nobody:
Average P.E Class"
Deliver Us,"I may be an Atheist, but even I cannot deny the sheer emotional power behind this opening.
Heck, I remember watching it right after Joseph: King of Dreams and the immediate shift in tone from that movie to this has stuck with me to this day. 

It's dark, heavy, dreadful, full of despair and pain. And yet with it is the power of human hope that shines through the darkness, pleas for freedom mixed with a mother's unyielding and total love for her son.

Both the things that makes Humanity major suckage and beautiful are present within the first 7 minutes of the movie. Absolute perfection."
Deliver Us,I was born the same year this film came out. Seeing this on the big screen must've been incredible.
Deliver Us,"I hope Dream Works or Disney will do The Prince of Egypt the movie again- a non-animated version like Alladin, Beauty and the Beast etc. If would be an EPIC and blockbuster for sure."
Deliver Us,I'm not religious but I've watched this movie so many times that I've actually started dreaming about it.....absolutely no-one can sing lullaby better than Ofra Haza....so talented and the voice out of this world....I've listened to every single dub she did and I take my hat off to her....RIP you've left something that will make everyone never forget you
Deliver Us,Ramses and Moses were so cute as kids
Deliver Us,this is so goated
Deliver Us,One minute in already tearing up😢

The Uncanny Counter,i wish i could see bl in this series between the two boys mun and the mayors son in season two it will be so great a new changes too🎉
The Uncanny Counter,"Decent supernatural themed show.The one thing I don;y understand is why Mun's own spirit partner was willing to label him an evil spirit Just because he lost control three times,can you blame him"
The Uncanny Counter,Honestly I find k dramas highly unreleastic and the cultural difference  is just too high.
Die Gustloff,Käsebrot essen
Die Gustloff,"This is absolutely a tragedy! But you cannot blame the Russians, that ship Wilhelm Gusloff was used as a warship by the Kriegsmarine!"
Die Gustloff,"Der erste Satz reicht schon aus, zum Umschalten."
Die Gustloff,It is a pity for all the innocents who died on that ship. And for the innocents of Europe who were victims of the Nazi Germans and their Fascist Allies.
Die Gustloff,Frechheit....
Die Gustloff,"What a shitty film! But what can we expect from the Lügenpresse... While the theme, the tragedy of the Gustloff would be really important to portrait."
Die Gustloff,An excellent film which depicted the fate of many refugees trying to escape to the west.
Die Gustloff,Good film.
Die Gustloff,War is terrible. Very sad and scary film.
Die Gustloff,An excellent film.
Die Gustloff,das ende ist echt ergreifend und furchtbar zugleich
Die Gustloff,"Thanks for the upload  ""Tom Wlaschiha Fanpage"" BUT WHY LEAVE THE BEGINNING OF THE  MOVIE OUT? An Important part !"

Die Gustloff,Der Stockinger
Die Gustloff,kann es sein das der Film mega geschnitten ist !!!!!!
Die Gustloff,Tendrían los nazis algún sentimiento o que les dolieran el corazón con tan terribles actos
Die Gustloff,¿Hay una versión de esta película con doblaje en castellano o subtitulada en español?
Die Gustloff,Lauterbach ....der marineoffizier mit reitstiefeln und hellbraunem ledergürtel...welcher IDIOT HAT HIER WIEDER DIE KOSTÜME HERGERICHTET.völliger bruch mit jedweder marineuniformierung.lachhaft
Die Gustloff,So very few people know about this. Thank you for making the movie.
Die Gustloff,Thank you for posting this movie!  Really enjoyed it!  First class acting and script. Reminded me of the classic war movies the British used to make back in the 1950s.
Space Brothers,"Great mixing by Steve, loved this set! Brought me back to Luminosity 2018 set, one of the best Lumi sets ever (#thatroom), which I was lucky to have experienced myself live...
Didn't expect to hear such rare stuff as ""Religion"" (how did Steve even get the full track if it's unreleased?🤔Has to be friends with Tony from Above & Beyond i guess), ""Epic Future"" & ""Spectrum"" (probably my favourite track of the whole set). 
Nice to see Matti Laamanen tune, would love to witness his set in the future. ""Turtle Beach"" - one of my favourite Armada releases. 
""The Promise"" - another pretty unknown track from The Space Brothers, discovered it from Lumi 2020 online broadcast. 
It's not too often I hear ""B.B.E. - Flash"" played out, as usually ""7 Days 1 Week"" gets all the attention.
Anyways, I'm gonna relisten to this beautiful set many times, so decided to make timestamps for the future.

Tower of God,❤
Tower of God,"Yeah, more tower of simp"
Tower of God,ANY SCENES FROM SEASON 2 I CAN ONLY SEE FROM SEASON 1 IT BASICALLY IS A SEASON 1 TRAILER
Tower of God,I can die a happy man if Kevin Penkin makes an ost as good as the first season of tower of god
Tower of God,Literally every scene here is season 1 not 2
Tower of God,"Watched this again, and man.... Penkin is the goat"
Tower of God,Jyu viole grace will be on 🔥
Tower of God,"This is great, but the fact that they made an entire trailer with only clips from the 1st season is kind of worrying. It will probably be a while before we hear any more news."
Tower of God,Can they hurry with this. siu is taking so long
Tower of God,Finally the manwha is back!!! NOW ALL WE NEED IS THE ANIME
Tower of God,I am so excited for this.

To The Abandoned Sacred Beasts,I can just watch this on a loop instead of the actual show
To The Abandoned Sacred Beasts,Hank reminds me of guts.
To The Abandoned Sacred Beasts,Hope they bring this back 🔥
To The Abandoned Sacred Beasts,If incarnates were in tokyo ghoul that would be so cool
To The Abandoned Sacred Beasts,This on nextflix right
To The Abandoned Sacred Beasts,"I would like there to be more to this.
It had potential to be something more popular.
I can understand if the Incarnates are supposed to be biological, and not mystical, but what if there was a witch or fairy?
They could have abilities that may seem magical enough.
The witch could have psychic abilities like telepathy and telekinesis.
The fairy could have insect wings, and use energy to heal.
What do you think?"
To The Abandoned Sacred Beasts,Very underrated
To The Abandoned Sacred Beasts,We need a session 2
To The Abandoned Sacred Beasts,No one knows this book series but this reminds me of “beast quest” for some reason
To The Abandoned Sacred Beasts,Awesome To the Abandoned Sacred Beasts Video.
To The Abandoned Sacred Beasts,Does anyone have the soundtrack to this show?! I know the soundtrack came out last June but I haven’t seen it anywhere and I’m desperate!
To The Abandoned Sacred Beasts,That is so cool!
To The Abandoned Sacred Beasts,The story plot gives me berserk vibes for some reason
To The Abandoned Sacred Beasts,"In the end, Cain is totally right. Hank is just trying to impose his guilt and with for vengeance for Ellen on the other Incarnates, while the human leaders are as bad as Cain, if not worse. Cain's father certainly is worse. This story suffers from a rather universal problem: it wants us to side against the Incarnates and with Hank because he's ""the good guy"", but the only real reason is because they're no longer humans and we are. So we're supposed to side with Hank because the Incarnates are not human. Doesn't work for me. And Cain is portrayed as too evil to say it's an attempt at showing a less one-sided view of the conflict.
And let's be honest, Hank is just driven by boner power. I'm not saying it's a bad motive, but it's far from the ""pure"" ones he platles about."
To The Abandoned Sacred Beasts,Cabin in the woods repeat! 😂😂😂

Yashahime: Princess Half-Demon,This is a thing???? So Ranma 1/2 remake is a possibility right????
Yashahime: Princess Half-Demon,Should have made sesshomaru the focus point... and why did they make em all girls? And 7 pearls (DragonBalls) . Hope season 2 is better.
Yashahime: Princess Half-Demon,"Scoperto oggi per caso. Abbiamo visto tutte le 6 stagioni, il final act e i 4 film con mio fratello. Non avrei mai immaginato di vedere una nuova stagione. NON VEDO L'ORA DI VEDERLO ♡☆"
Yashahime: Princess Half-Demon,This is a gift
Yashahime: Princess Half-Demon,"Well, now I saw the first and second season. Just waiting for the coming episodes. But actually... Do someone know, where is Shippo? The Little fox demon? All the Charakters from Inuyasha were shown, except Shippo. Why? Where is Shippo? He died? Or is he traveling around the world? Or did he found his love and married?"
Yashahime: Princess Half-Demon,We have started watching it few months ago and now we are currently season 1/2
Yashahime: Princess Half-Demon,I've watched Inuyasha 2 times already.  Some of it I slept through but I know everything I need to know before watching the series.
Yashahime: Princess Half-Demon,I hope they do the same with ranma ½
Yashahime: Princess Half-Demon,schau ich gerade is mega
Yashahime: Princess Half-Demon,"Sesshomaru smashed Rin, she's the babies moms. That's cool since she was so loyal to him and he cared for her."
Yashahime: Princess Half-Demon,Should I watch inuyasha before I watch this anyone?
Yashahime: Princess Half-Demon,Kaede still kicking huh?
Yashahime: Princess Half-Demon,This is not inyuasha
Yashahime: Princess Half-Demon,"Poxa, vim na esperança de está em português"
Yashahime: Princess Half-Demon,"Inuyasha is in my top 3 favorite anime, its so hard to pick a favorite with so many amazing anime out there so im super excited for this anime.i cant wait to watch it and i really hope its as fantastic as Inuyasha."
Yashahime: Princess Half-Demon,Mentira aahhhhh😍
Yashahime: Princess Half-Demon,This show was decent until it got struck with the (typical)characters all of suddden just stand around and do nothing in battle
Yashahime: Princess Half-Demon,"There's an entire story before this right?
I really hope it isn't as long as One Piece..."
Yashahime: Princess Half-Demon,"Not to be that guy, but only thing that makes me keep watching this is the flashback 🙄"
Yashahime: Princess Half-Demon,Yes Rin is the mother (even if it’s weird to me imagine that sesshomaru could be romantic ???)
Rich Man,Hello everybody! I'm still alive! 😂 I'm glad  you keep enjoying this old video after so long.
Rich Man,I HAD TO SELL MY HORSE FOR FOOD AND SHELTER BECAUSE OF THE REBELLIOUS CHRISTIANS!! AND WE BEGIN WITH THEM IN THIS GAME OF THRONES 🔥🐲🔥🐲🔥🐲
Rich Man,We don't need subtitles. Lol
Rich Man,This song has cleaned my aparment many times...
Rich Man,"""When you're rich they think you really know"""
Rich Man,The staircase leading nowhere just for show is mad flexing 🤣
Rich Man,The best ever!❤❤❤❤
Rich Man,I love the yada da da bit
Rich Man,What a great movie that was! Plenty of people still sing or hum that song even now and most of them aren't Jewish!
Rich Man,The people in this film poor jews from eastern Europe are the type of people murdered in the Holocaust by the demonic nazis it is so sad.
Rich Man,What a movie! Saw it as a child when it was first released.
Rich Man,I'm going to sing this in the Pub on Sunday
Rich Man,i was today years old when i realized tich girl covered this
Rich Man,Pogo's rendition of this is fantastic!!
Rich Man,"I never seen this film but I know this song! Classic lol
In Hebrew parody, instead of ""If I were a rich man"", we used to say, ""If I were a Rothchild"" in the past 🤣"
Rich Man,Most rich men would replace their double chin wives 🤣🤣🤣
Rich Man,"This Yiddish chant is a masterpiece!  A song of dream, desire, pain, invocation, despair, pathos, combined with lyrical beauty.  Gorgeous and engaging. 
🎵🕎❤️✡️🎶"
Rich Man,"I don't know how many times I have watched this, but I keep coming back to it and singing along with Tevye. I don't think there is a single person in the world who could sing 'If I were a rich man' better than Chaim Topol.♥♥♥♥♥"
Rich Man,"Topol will always have immortality due to this song and his unforgettable interpretation of it. There have been many Tevye’s over the years, none match Topol"
Rich Man,"my choir coach in high school, mr Andrues, performed this for us as a way to teach us how to utilize the range in our voice and how to have confidence with complicated songs like this!"
Path of the Dragons,Day of Dragons could be shaping up to be the Dragon survival game of 2023 when it's in our hands. Each month they ask us to come back and see what they've been working on and each month they impress. I hope you're all getting goosebumps like me 😆
Path of the Dragons,I literally cannot wait to get a pc and get this game :b this game is a dream come true for me
Path of the Dragons,to bad all their dragon designs are unorginal
Path of the Dragons,"Name for the Rhino looking thing.. ""Testa cornu. Aka, Shell horn"" 
Shell Horn sounds cool to me
because its armor turns into a point afront of its face like a horn. So a Shell Horn."
Path of the Dragons,"This kinda reminds me of Toothless but without legs lol but I love it tho
Also the Skrill too
Also the 2nd guy, the wyvern reminds me of the monsterous nightmare too cuz they set themselves on fire"
Path of the Dragons,"ngl i was grinning ear to ear watching this video, i had high expectations for this game for how much potential it has, and the devs continue to deliver, great job."
Path of the Dragons,I wouldn't be surprised if the blitz striker was pay to use
Path of the Dragons,OML EVER SINGLE TIME HE CHANGES THE THUMBNAIL I THINK ITS A NEW VIDEO.
Path of the Dragons,"cool, a definitely not skrill and definitely not monstrous nightmare...."
Path of the Dragons,"Man. This is just bad. Models do not look good. The audiodesign is bad. Its a rip off once again.... both of them. 

Seeing the history of the devs and this game, as well as its current state... I am so happy I did not spend a single cent on this."
Path of the Dragons,Skrill + Night Fury + Light Fury = .....
Path of the Dragons,"first a night fury, now a skrill. quality"
Path of the Dragons,They’re all realistic versions of dragons from “How to train your Dragon”.
Path of the Dragons,Just look up skrills
Path of the Dragons,That just looks like a skrills from how to train your dragons turned into a snake
Path of the Dragons,Is it on Xbox?
Path of the Dragons,so when do these changes actually come to the game.  been waiting for something to actually happen with this game for years.   and wyvern was in the game before.
Path of the Dragons,Wyverns are dragons
Path of the Dragons,pretty sure the Inferno Ravenger is based off of the Monstrous Nightmare from HTTYD. MN can also light it self on fire.
Path of the Dragons,To think this game will likely leave early access before the isle....
Olympia Kyklos,This is great.  Mrs. Yamazaki is very good at writing these kinds of scenarios; and the claymation is very fun.  Thank you for uploading.
Moriarty the Patriot,Catch me if you can mister horse 😏

Moriarty the Patriot,This show is so much better than it has any right to be
Moriarty the Patriot,literally the best opening in the anime history

Moriarty the Patriot,"It's a good anime, but it makes Sherlock Holmes look unimportant, for that I would have made an anime apart from Sherlock Homes, but I enjoy Holmes I like his comical personality."

Moriarty the Patriot,"So what you’re tell me is, moriarty did nothing wrong?"
Im Standing on a Million Lives,Before I watch this who’s his “love” interest.
Im Standing on a Million Lives,What's wrong with the audio?
Im Standing on a Million Lives,Why did I know what this was but didn't at the same time
Im Standing on a Million Lives,"they really need to have different setting than the 1 dude and 50 females, it destroys immersion and feels repetitive."
Im Standing on a Million Lives,I really love this show.  but the women are the most god damn useless waste of space and drawing i have ever seen.  It's like they never even tried to get strong.  Besides one of them.   I was so mad.
Im Standing on a Million Lives,PICTURE IT! ONE MILLION LIVES!!
Im Standing on a Million Lives,I was interested until I got here 0:23
Im Standing on a Million Lives,Worst isekai I ever seen
Im Standing on a Million Lives,"The most useless heroes ever. 
Main character is somewhat okay tho."
Im Standing on a Million Lives,the first season was much better than the second.
Im Standing on a Million Lives,"""the rising of the shield hero"" version 2.0"
Im Standing on a Million Lives,I prefer rural anime like naruto where theres nothing electronics but there are a few that are ok
Im Standing on a Million Lives,anime
Im Standing on a Million Lives,gargbage ...
Im Standing on a Million Lives,Still waiting for season 2 to come out in July. They better not pull a classroom of the elite
Im Standing on a Million Lives,This show is so aids literally every character is annoying. Do not waste your time and watch this trash.
Im Standing on a Million Lives,"2 episodes in, cant even force myself to watch the third. It feels so stiff. Maybe it’s the lackluster animation and visuals (Which starts from ep 1, which is kinda strange). Also the story is generic af. The characters are pretty much copy and paste. We all seen this before, to many times. I wish it where actually good, would have been cool, since I could’ve binged through it. A solid skip"
Im Standing on a Million Lives,I didnt expect for me to love this anime
Im Standing on a Million Lives,On episode 5 and losing interest. I hope it gets better because I heard good things about it
Im Standing on a Million Lives,the anime is ok the thing that drives me crazy that its about 10 min of the anime and 10 min of flashbacks from their childhood or what ever it fcking tilts me to the moon
DRAGON QUEST The Adventure of Dai,Guardian talers assemble!

DRAGON QUEST The Adventure of Dai,"People keep talking about Dragon Ball Z and One Piece, while this gem is so much better."
DRAGON QUEST The Adventure of Dai,New dragon ball looks lit oh wait…
DRAGON QUEST The Adventure of Dai,This show is soooo GOOD
DRAGON QUEST The Adventure of Dai,Never knew there was a (remake ?) the original was my favorite as a kid currently watching this and loving it
DRAGON QUEST The Adventure of Dai,I might have to check this out
DRAGON QUEST The Adventure of Dai,This trailer doesn’t do the anime justice at all to a painful degree. If you haven’t watched an episode yet I highly recommend it.
DRAGON QUEST The Adventure of Dai,"One of my all time favourite anime series !! This modern series of it is so charming and the story has a lot of heartfelt moments. Don't forget about the incredible combat,  choreography and the art is gorgeous!! :)"
DRAGON QUEST The Adventure of Dai,I wonder when might the English Dubbed version of (DRAGON QUEST: THE ADVENTURE OF DAI) anime series will get made?
DRAGON QUEST The Adventure of Dai,"I did watch the whole thing on Hulu and it was excellent. I don’t exactly play Dragon Quest but this is great though.

I wish if they can make a second season of the adventures of Dai 😣"
DRAGON QUEST The Adventure of Dai,Dragon quest is one the greatest franchises made by the same creator of Dragon ball
DRAGON QUEST The Adventure of Dai,The way they did the lighting looks awesome

DRAGON QUEST The Adventure of Dai,Look it’s Crono with black hair!
DRAGON QUEST The Adventure of Dai,"i love this show 
i wish it were more popular tho"
Double Fantasy,I don't agree with most comments! This is the only time I have heard Yoko make a real listenable contribution to music. Her songs provide a perfect balance. You have to get the name out of your head and listen objectively!
Double Fantasy,"Ukraine, Kyiv.  Велике -  бачиться на відстані... Багатьом людям, вчинки творчих людей важко зрозуміти. Хочеться вірити, що Джон Леннон, відносно Йоко Оно, зробив вільний та усвідомлений вибір. Якщо це так, питань на має, у кожної людини свій шлях. Щодо мене, двічі слухати 'спів Йоко Оно' природнього бажання не з'явилось. А пісні у виконанні The Beatles, як і їх сольні альбоми, слухаю з великим задоволенням вже багато років."
Double Fantasy,"i asked a friend  if he's ever listened to this album-i like Yoko he doesn't- his reply? ""yeah every other song."" as a Yoko fan I had to laugh."
Double Fantasy,Kiss kiss kiss is that horror ska that didn't really come into fashion until a bit later
Double Fantasy,"Very singular album....Yoko's one song that I do like , is the birthday song dedicated to her son."
Double Fantasy,Love em so very much
Double Fantasy,It ain't  fair
Double Fantasy,Still hurts.  Yup
Double Fantasy,"First time hearing this entire album. I had to fast forward Yoko ""musick"" I was eating dinner.🤮"
Double Fantasy,yokos crap need to be deleted
Double Fantasy,Say what you want bout Yoko she was inspiration for Imagine from her book Grapefruit.
Double Fantasy,"John Lennon & Yoko. Double Fantasy.

Genre: Rock, Pop/Rock, Soft Rock, Art Rock, Blues Rock
Format: Vinyl, LP, Album, CD, Stereo
Label: Geffen Records
Country: United States
Released: November 17, 1980
Recorded: August - September, 1980 at The Hit Factory, New York City"
Double Fantasy,Best best best album of John. The melodies are prime Beatles quality; though Yoko's songs kinda drag the album a bit. Wish John's  milk and honey outtakes were polished and released on this album instead of Yoko's songs.
Double Fantasy,"No sé por qué tan poquitos likes, este álbum es una obra de arte, cierto, algunas de las canciones de Yoko no son tan buenas pero fuera de eso, es una obra maestra... Muchas gracias por subir el álbum completo 😃👍🏼"
Double Fantasy,Yoko arruina todo
Double Fantasy,Que rola tan chingona
Double Fantasy,This is such an awesome album.
Dennou Coil,uma bosta
Dennou Coil,"I started watching this on the same day I started using glasses, lol..."
Dennou Coil,"Any Gachatubers & #gachalife players watching?
Please make a Gacha version of this?"
Dennou Coil,"Just finished this in perpetration for Mitsuo Iso’s new directorial project Orbital Children. Both shows are fascinating, weird, and endearing sci-fi anime."
Dennou Coil,original tentunya
Dennou Coil,aku ada kasetnya apa ada yg mau beli?
Dennou Coil,"Damn this's actually a really good trailer. I feels more like the style of trailers we more usually get with many Anime movies from about this time. It has a very nice, more fluid style that transition smoother from one clip to the next, rather than just trying to bombard you with 'tons' of action one after another and lots of shouting. The character animation design style is quite distinct too. I really should try this series out sometime soon. It was recommended only a few minutes ago after seeing a trailer by the same director for a film he's made so will have to add this series to my 2022 new years watch list."
Dennou Coil,"Seriously, this anime should get way more attention. I admit it's not perfect (especially when getting towards the end), but it's still an exemplary anime that hits many good notes."
Dennou Coil,This is not a trailer. But the song is awesome!
Dennou Coil,"What's this anime about, is it good?"
Dennou Coil,Love this trailer
The Day I Became a God,"2 years, it doesn't feel remotely that long since I've seen this but I'm so glad I got to see it. The anime this man/studio has made and inspired changed my life."
The Day I Became a God,"I have to say I did not have high hopes for this anime whenever I saw the trailer. But by god, did it ever rip my heart out and curb stomp it."
The Day I Became a God,"This was a hidden gem fr, its definitely up there with suka suka if you wanna feel your heart wrench and have tears flowing left and right but I never expected that ending. That was so bittersweet 😭"
The Day I Became a God,"This anime broke me entirely, I would defiantly recommend for a quick 2-4 day watch"
The Day I Became a God,"-Watches your lie in April: "" I will never be tricked into another depressing a** show again!

- This Anime: Gotcha b***h -___-"
The Day I Became a God,I wish Hulu had a chat feature like Crunchyroll. im in the 1st episode and she is mad jelly at his name and his female friends name but did anyone notice his friend shooting hoops with him is named Ashura?
The Day I Became a God,I cried like a giant man baby >_> it takes a lot to get me emotional but this one hit me right in the feels. The last few episodes really stick with you.
The Day I Became a God,THE GIRL LOOKS LIKE CHIKA
The Day I Became a God,"yes, j just came for charlotte and angel beats in the end. 
ps: love little busters ❤️"
The Day I Became a God,added to my watch list
The Day I Became a God,This anime is really good if u havent saw it yet i totally suggest u should!!
The Day I Became a God,"""The world shall end in 30 days""

If you still said the world would end in 10 sec, I would still believe you, humanity is a mistake, just a happy accident"
The Day I Became a God,My heart died
The Day I Became a God,Tbh in my opinion this anime kinda suck
The Day I Became a God,Am I the only one that cried on ep 12
The Day I Became a God,I watched the whole series it's good and heartwarming lol
The Day I Became a God,This show is good
The Day I Became a God,anime power will is too strong i cried over too many animes i even cried over a boat in anime its getting out of hand
The Day I Became a God,"I see a lot of elements of angel beats that is making me equally sad and happy that this anime has.

Fun fact: same studio!"
The Day I Became a God,This is so bad
Coffee & Vanilla,I didn’t know they made the drama from the manga 😮.

Coffee & Vanilla,福原遥ちゃん、可愛い☺️💕🤲
Coffee & Vanilla,My first and favourite jdrama. I am conservative in real life but while I'm watching dramas I am freaking sadist!😷
Coffee & Vanilla,Ep?
Coffee & Vanilla,Thank you 💖😍 for creat ....the whole drama in one song.....even song related this drama....💋💖💓💋💋💋💋💋💋
Coffee & Vanilla,coffee and vanilla 💖 this is my first Japanese drama afteri watch this I love this drama.....😍😍😍 I love Dori ......this drama is too much loveble....
Coffee & Vanilla,"Почему в японских дорама героини часто какие-то замороженные?😅😂 как-будто аутисты или травма детства. А мужчины всегда супер заботливые и сразу влюбляются в ее богатый внутренний мир, который зрителю не показывают)))))"
Coffee & Vanilla,ما اسم المسلسل
Coffee & Vanilla,"i just finished the whole drama about half an hour ago - its my first japanese drama & the fastest i;ve ever finished a drama, huge thanks to tiktok for making me want to watch it aaaaa"
Coffee & Vanilla,hIROTO SO INTENSE SEXUALLY
Coffee & Vanilla,"he''s so hot, so other nhen a inne drama with that actress (his names was Daikichi)."
Coffee & Vanilla,"Sooooo.... i'm watching this drama and i have to say that i don't see the appeal... Granted a different culture but i don't believe that women in Japan are this naive(yeah i know it's fiction, but still🤨🤨), the dialog it's just cringe, etc...."
Blue Spring Ride,"🥲: me right now who really felt bad to other people who made some comments in this video cause it's like chaos here in comment section. I didn't expect that there would be some arguments here (I'm not referring to all comments but some), I didn't mean this to happen, (I'm really sorry 😢) I just want to share and show some of the two main character moments or how their relationship started from this amazing Anime. I'm always rooting for Kou and Futaba! ❤(And of course lets also appreciate the other characters or part of the Anime, but I know that I can't convince you to accept them all because we can't tolerate toxic traits and that is alright, it's your choice and belief, I will respect you my dear, but those toxic traits can be remove and change into a good traits). Let's spread peace because I love you my dear viewers so much.

Since I have enough of this madness let me tell you something my dear ones.

I believe that every Romance has its own story, it could be complicated or not at all. We just need to understand it's concept and cherish it because love can connect people. But always remember that every stories doesn't end without obstacles. Every Anime that has romance genre has its own uniqueness and that's what makes them a beautiful Anime. 

For those people who made bad statements to Kou, I understand you because I had been there. But I learned and realized why he became like that or why Kou behaves in that way and I wish you also do the same before bad mouthing him. Okay? 

And for those who chose Touma over Kou, it's also okay. I also understand ( I had also been there AT FIRST hehe but in the end, I stayed neutral like not hating Kou anymore because I already understand the difference between the two guys) but it is bad to praise Touma without exposing or admitting his wrong doings while exposing Kou's bad side only. You are obviously biased and didn't consider the main character's feelings. Always be neutral my dear.

I hope you understand and as the uploader of this video, I strongly encouraging you to stop spreading false information (Because I also read the manga twice, and I really like the flow of the story so much!) and some viewers seems didn't understand the story at all. I also agree with some comments here that reading the Manga AGAIN is the best solution to eradicate the confusions and misunderstandings so that we can have a good communication to each other. And please don't make a false statement without knowing the whole story first because there is a small chance that people will belive in you and that is really wrong my dear. I DO REALLY HATE PEOPLE ARGUING AND SPREADING FALSE INFORMATIONS. 

This video is to show some clips of the Anime: Ao Haru Ride and to encourage the other viewers to watch it because it is really a beautiful Anime :).

Let us spread peace my dear ones and thank you for watching the short vid!

I LOVE YOU ALL!!!"
Blue Spring Ride,Ep?
Blue Spring Ride,Feel bad for the kid he’s been through way more then he should’ve and can’t communicate his feelings properly
Blue Spring Ride,I really shouldn't take other people opinions too seriously lol I almost don't watch this cause they said ml is a trash? He had flaws but it ain't inhuman😂
Blue Spring Ride,He literally behaves like a cat
Blue Spring Ride,https://youtu.be/pqY16UwUmCI
Blue Spring Ride,الغيرة 😭😭
Blue Spring Ride,"I really want to read the manga I do, but Im kinda pressed to hear she gets with another guy but I'm curious how long that lasts in terms of volumes? I don't wanna buy them and jus hate reading it the whole time"
Blue Spring Ride,Dam his voice wth niceee🐛
Blue Spring Ride,Bro i thought he was jealous of the girl 💀
Blue Spring Ride,"I only briefly skimmed the comments, but idk why people take these things so seriously. It kind of ruins it tbh. It's a shojo manga, it's a lighthearted anime. I find people treat anime and manga like it's real. Read the story or watch the anime and move on. I wholeheartedly enjoyed the manga and anime, it was frustrating and sweet at times, and then I got to the end and moved on to the next thing. Stop trying to act like it's real. These people are characters."
Blue Spring Ride,"I think I removed all the negative comments that results misunderstanding and prejudice against Kou. If there are still bad comments here please let me know ❤.

Love you all!!! ❤"
Blue Spring Ride,This manga is just a masterpiece I felt so bad for kou and futaba they had to go through a lot manipulated by ppl around them taken advantage for their own selfishness I wish there were more kou×futaba moments after their reconciliation but it's fine they ended up good❤❤
Blue Spring Ride,"He literally loved futaba more then he did to himself he even named he's cat ""yoshioka"" wrote her whole name in he's notebook knew that he's gona hurt futaba while helping Narumi and decided to reject her but regret it for doing it he hugged her many times kissed her and Pat her head when she was crying he even tried chasing after her when she was in a relationship and changed for her he's such a  best boy I don't get the slander and hate at all"
Blue Spring Ride,WHO THE HELL EATS CHIPS LIKE THAT 😭 BRO TURNED INTO AN ANIME GIRL
Blue Spring Ride,"Reading some comments I've realised how misunderstood Kou is, he's a 16 year old traumatised teen who got manipulate, taken advantage of and dragged down into misery not evil. He's downbad for Futaba, even named his cat after her and yes made mistakes, grew and learned from them like we all do. That's what makes him good, his journey to moving forward and letting his mom go after seeing her weaken day by day on his own, is heartbreaking. It touched my heart. Put yourself in his shoes and try understanding his pov."
Blue Spring Ride,The manga is really a rollercoaster of emotions and depicted trauma symptoms and realistic teens well. It reminds me of my youth and brings back memories. Each time you read you notice new things. Love them so much.
Blue Spring Ride,I love the manga so much Kou and Futaba are everything. Their kiss scenes 😍
Blue Spring Ride,Ain't no way that some of you say Touma was a better choice and that you would've picked him when he manipulated Futaba into a relationship
Blue Spring Ride,jealous Kou is so tiny 🥺❤
Beelzebub,"okay demon princes, where the f* are you? where is my money?"
Beelzebub,Now I am curious how in the hell does anybody that walks this Earth no what hell looks like get back with me on that
Beelzebub,Allah is lord of heaven n hell
Beelzebub,Do you know that praying in the name of Jesus in Rightous heart can ruin demons kingdom ✝️✝️✝️☦️☦️☦️
Beelzebub,"They do not RULE hell, they are PUNISHED there. God created it, so God rules it."
Beelzebub,Archon in genshin. Aka Raiden Ei of the 7 archons
Beelzebub,There is no hell
Beelzebub,biblical propaganda 👎
Beelzebub,"Where did you get your information from? 

Demons don't live in hell but on earth.. only you don't see them and they see us.. they die like people die and hellfire or paradise is only after Judgment Day..

When all souls will arise, so All Demons and all mankind.. and God will give us proofs/Evidence what we have done here on earth.. 

Not all demons are evil and not all humans are evil. but most demons will end up in hell like most people will end up in hell. 

Purely because they worship someone other than God or worship someone besides God. 

Satan has all the time on earth to deceive mankind and his own kind into Fire with him 🔥

He is smart and he will make sure you will worship anything but the real lord or worship someone besides the lord..

And paradise has 1 Rule. 

No One has the right to be whorshipped except The Lord Alone 😗.. 

i dont remember Jesus whorshipped a god called Jesus or Holy Ghost 🤔"
Beelzebub,JESUS! You guys really make this crap up
Beelzebub,"If you want to learn about the spiritual world , study the Bible.  Everything else is made up by men"
Beelzebub,Now he isn't nothing He lost his spot in HEAVEN and live in hell. And all POWER!!!!! Well be taken from him by god ALMIGHTY. The SEA of fire is where he will be recited.forever...ELOHIM 👑⚡🌍🌌
Beelzebub,Hell wad created to torment demons . so how could it be that they rule in hell ?
Beelzebub,Allohu akbar! ♥️👌
Beelzebub,"Lucifer/satan was an anointed cherubim Ezekiel 28:13-14 and he sinned Gen 3 spoken of as a dragon/snake /serpent as in Rev 12:7 and  spoken of in Isaiah 14:12 ""how u are fallen from heaven, O lucifer ..
PLUS he doesn't rule hell, Rev 9:11/Rev 20:1-3 Hell/bottomless pit is ruled by Angel Abaddon (angel of God) as in above scriptures.
And in Rev 12 satan/lucifer/serpent was thrown out of heaven and caught by Angel Abaddon. Now on earth it's other fallen angels ruling headed by Jezebel."
Beelzebub,Beehive
Beelzebub,I thought he was part of Squad Zero in Bleach
Beelzebub,PLEASE your Interpretation letters are blurred can't read it do.something about it
Beelzebub,This is 100 true and these things do exist. Infact devil or iblis or u can call him azazel has 9 to 12 sons each possesses immense power and then under them there is generation of demons which exist. Among 12 tribes 3 tribes of jins or demons known to be strongest and no human can control their kind. They are also called arafits and each arafit controls 3-4 small demons
Beelzebub,"He,a seraphim fallen angel  is higher than Lucifer,a cherubim fallen angel...but befitting his numero uno master of deception status,he,Lucifer is the boss of them all!"
Barangay 143,Ganda ng animation dito 2:50
Barangay 143,"Kaya maraming low quality na  palabas sa Pinas ay dahil sa mga taong may ""pwede na yan"" mindset. Tanggap lang ng tanggap kahit di naman talaga maganda. Taasan niyo naman sana yung standard niyo. 

 Tapos magcocomment pa na ""edi kayo na gumawa""  taena niyo. Kaya kami nagki-criticized kasi gusto namin na mag-improve at maging success sila. Maraming talented na mga animator dito sa Pilipinas na hindi nabibigyan ng opportunity na magkatrabaho. Ito na sana ung pagkakataon na maipakita yun at magbigay ng way sa mas marami pang projects kaso tagilid eh."
Barangay 143,Sana Yung mga nasa gma dubbers
Barangay 143,"0:06 sino namang nagtatambol ang ganto humawak ng stick? Hahhaa.. Yung totoo, may balak kang butasin yung drum? 😆"
Barangay 143,Laban brain park
Barangay 143,Iba eh. Masyadong mabilis yung eksena. Nasanay kasi ako sa Anime basketball na naka kapag usap pa yung mga players habang tumatalon sa ere at nakakapag flashback pa ng nakaraan yung player na nag su shoot.
Barangay 143,"Ganda ganda bgy ky ja ay este vicky ung role nia hehe,👍,"
Barangay 143,Napanood ko na yan sa Netflix
Barangay 143,"Gumawa pa ng maraming ganito, positive lang tayo. Mag iimprove din yan. Walang kakaumpisa pa lang ay perfect agad. Sa halip gawing challenge ang mga negative comments. Support pa rin ako sa sariling atin. Sana marami pang ma ipalabas na mga anime ang mga pinoy. Kaya natin to. Laban lang."
Barangay 143,"Si boy labo one week bago pumasok ang tira , ito naman tira ng tira yung announcer lang nagsasalita hahaha"

Barangay 143,Guys chill this is not anime cuz it not made in japan so we can called it filipino animation
Barangay 143,Hindi ba siya mag kakaroon ng season 2
Barangay 143,"Maangas na kwento and animation, More Improvement sa mga movements para kasing level na natin yung Japan. Tuloy lang  💪🔥"
Barangay 143,"Isa pang napansin ko, parang walang alam sa basketball yung sumulat nito. Parang puro score at pasa lang ang nangyayari. Walang plays, matchups, or even defined skillset yung players. Parang yung storya neto, ginamit lang ang basketball bilang ""coating"" sa isa pang typical na lovestory. Naalala ko tuloy yung MVP Valentine, isa pang basketball-flavored lovestory."
Barangay 143,Napaka ganda!!! Support Local!!
Barangay 143,Wala na bang part15 bitin eh Hahah sana magtuloy tuloy tong anime na to
