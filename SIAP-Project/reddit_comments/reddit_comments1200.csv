TV Show,Comment
All American,Coincidentally I just did a tour of the Warner Brothers Studio in Burbank and saw the All American Set and the base camp for Winning Time.
All American,Cost cutting move? He's easily the most famous person in the cast
All American,Season 1-2 of this show was pretty good.  Went to complete crap after
All American,Give us a second season of Day Break!
All American,"They gave him a hero's send-off which was good to see, but shocking to learn about. 

The show is still ok, but spinning it's wheels over the past 1 1/2 seasons. Interesting to see what happens now ."
All American,"Did you see john c reilly’s sweet airstream trailer?  Among all the modern crew trailer, John has his own restored silver beauty in the lot there!"
All American,exactly
All American,That seems to be the norm for CW shows.
All American,Is it satisfying to watch only 1 and 2? Would you say there’s an ending (or a cliffhanger you can ignore)?
All American,"Seconded!  It's one of the better ""groundhog day"" shows."
All American,"I didn't notice that one. There were a bunch of white ones, that were supplied by a single company.

When you take the tour the tour guide drives a group around in the big golf carts. We did see Michael Chiklis in costume outside his trailer smoking a big cigar. He smiled at us and waved."
All American,"Or they just start as complete crap. 

Seriously, what happens at CW for their shows to be so god awful?"
All American,Low budget
All American,You can make a good tv show with out a great budget
All American,"Usually those are sitcoms with amazing writers. CW gets low viewers, is made in Canada, and has a low budget that for a lot of their shows they blow on shit cgi. They don’t attract top talent."
All American,"Normally this would be a no brainer but with the new owners taking over this actually tells us a lot - The CW isn't giving up on scripted TV yet, like many suspected they would."
All American,I hope superman and lois also gets renewed
All American,">The network has handed an early sixth season renewal to the drama series, marking the first scripted renewal after Nexstar took ownership earlier this year.

>All American, which was The CW’s number one linear series in adult 18-49, most-watched series on digital and the largest show in total audience across all platforms, will launch its fifth season on January 23.

>Deadline understands the series, which comes from Berlanti Productions in association with Warner Bros. Television and CBS Studios, will continue to be produced in line with its previous seasons. This comes despite talk that the network is looking to cut budgets for scripted orders and floating a target license fee for drama series of $1 million dollar per episode going forward.

>“Over the last five seasons, All American has established itself as one of the all-time CW flagship franchises,” said Schwartz. “All American is not only the network’s youngest series, but also the strongest performer when combining all our platforms. We look forward to continuing our collaboration with showrunner Nkechi Okoro Carroll, Greg Berlanti, Sarah Schechter, the entire creative team and the incredible cast for another season of captivating family drama.”"
All American,I hope Kung Fu pulls through too
All American,Woah CW renewing something? Guess they’re not entirely out of the game
All American,"All American is CW? I never realized that. Network has moved away from what it used to be then.


I guess the Arrowverse is completely over then? I haven't watched any of those (at least not on CW rather than Netflix) for 3-4 years so I didn't know if they were still running"
All American,God this show is so bad
All American,"Wait, they're allowed to do that?"
All American,It does tell us they're giving up on scripted tv that requires a decent amount of cgi.
All American,"It'll be interesting to see if All American: Homecoming makes it, or if they just keep the original."
All American,Kind of surprised they renewed this honestly. I assumed this show was finished once Nextstar took over.
All American,"Arrowverse is nearly finished. The Flash is getting 1 more season which, judging from the casting announcements, is going to tie the universe up with a bow. There's also a new show coming out, Gotham Knights, but it looks dead in the water. Trailer got a negative reaction, I'm not sure if it's in the same universe, and the CW's new owners (as well as WB) are in cost cutting mode."
All American,"Winding down, close to being officially done. 

Flash is getting a final season, a bit shorter at only 13 episodes. Some old faces including Amell are guest starring. No word on Benoist or Loltz yet though. Some older Flash specific faces too. 

S & L is still going but made it a point to say it's not the same world end of last season. The official answer for being some of the same actors is different Earth doppelgangers now. They're still using David Ramsey as Diggle at least once a year but say it's a different Diggle. He's supposed to be in both this and Flash this year again too. 

Ramsey's concept for a show of Diggle mentoring 5 metahumans at a school Justice U, is apparently still making good progress on the development side but I'd be surprised if it goes to series. Not clear if it's supposed to be him as Arrowverse Duggle or S & L Diggle either. 

Gotham Knights has no premiere date yet. It's can't be Arrowverse because of the different way it wrote out Bruce. Internet rumors say it may be the same world as S & L but no source to back that up yet. Also I'd be surprised if it gets a Season 2."
All American,"I read an article that suggested Nexstar was contractually committed to at least one CBS show and one Warner Bros show for next season. I guess we just learned the identity of the Warner Bros show. Makes sense as it is the top show in the demo. 

Walker will almost certainly be the CBS show. 

What happens with Superman & Lois will be interesting. It was the other bet for Warner Bros. Will it get renewed as well or will they now pull the plug?"
All American,">  I'm not sure if it's in the same universe

One of the writers on Batwoman said they developed the show as a direct spin off to Batwoman and would've been set up in the show's third season but the word came down from Warner Bros to separate it from the Arrowverse because they weren't confident about Batwoman's chances of getting renewed, and on top of that they put a bunch of other restrictions on it during development. Originally they wanted Tim Drake to be the Robin that was the lead but Warner Bros said no to that and the lead being the OC 'Turner Hayes' was the compromise they came to in order to get the show greenlit."
All American,"I thought Gotham Knights was a video game. I'm a lot more out of the loop on Arrowverse than I thought, because I haven't watched Supergirl, Batgirl, or S & L at all and I never finished Legends or Flash."
All American,My guess is Superman and Lois is done. Especially since James Gunn is rebooting the character and DC entirely.
All American,Probably depends on ratings and whether James Gunn's reboot is truly as all-encompassing as he's said.
All American,"So messy with Tim Drake in Titans. 

I think they’re on what like five concurrent live action universes.
What is it?

Titans
Doom Patrol
Superman and Lois
Flash
Gotham Knights
Peacemaker/Snyderverse
Pennyworth

No Seven… And I’m just counting TV."
All American,"> I thought Gotham Knights was a video game

It is, both the game and the series are set in a Gotham City after Batman has been killed and the Court of Owls are the bad guys but they're unrelated and no creatives worked on both, just a coincidence of development."
All American,"It is but there's also a separate show. Also, it was Batwoman. Itself going along this convoluted way after having to change the lead after S1. Legends and Batwoman were both canceled last year when things started to change over at Warner and the CW."
All American,"His comment about aligning movies, television, *and* video games perplexed me. I don’t believe it’s possible to tie in AAA video games, they take way too long to make. Any studio spinning up a game now is likely targeting the PS6, that’s how intense it is"
All American,"I've only ever watched Legends on Netflix. I was watching Arrow and Flash as they aired for a few seasons each, but it seemed like every time there was a new show in the universe all the talented writers jumped over there and the previous show was left to flounder."
All American,"Yeah, that is kind of crazy to me, as well, especially since I imagine that plans could change as time goes on as far as direction. I have to wonder if maybe it's more a case of ""Okay, we know that there is going to be a Lobo movie in 2027 so let's license out Lobo so he has a game in 2027 as well"", even if perhaps it won't *really* be connected to the movie."
All American,That's exactly what happened. Franchising was writing checks the writers couldn't cash. Not to mention they had an insanely ambitious crossover a few years back that felt enough like a finale it gave long time viewers an out.
All American,Dang I can’t believe it’s been going to 9 seasons of Flash. That just blows my mind.
All American,CW cancelling something is always a bigger story than they rubber stamp their renewals.
All American,"Having never seen an episode, I get the feeling that Riverdale is a much more fun show to hear people exasperatedly try to explain than watch. Almost like its continued existence is meant to torment a certain segment of YouTube in some twisted experiment"
All American,"I had a feeling that ***Nancy Drew*** would be renewed. The CW would not have ordered the ***Tom Swift*** spinoff if the show was genuinely under threat of cancellation.

I wonder if this means the ***Walker: Independence*** spinoff pilot has a good chance of being picked up to series with the renewal of ***Walker***."
All American,"Just renew Legends it’s become my favorite guilty pleasure show. It’s 45 minutes of wacky, zany, no brain needed stupidity. I love it."
All American,"CW could be left with no original cast members, and a picture of Grant Gustin’s foot and still get 3 more seasons out of The Flash."
All American,Happy about Superman & Lois. Hope Legends makes it. Don't care much about rest.
All American,I hope Legends is renewed.
All American,Really happy to see Nancy Drew renewed! Honestly one of the better written CW shows.
All American,Riverdale is trash but I'm gonna watch every single episode!
All American,The Flash hasn’t been good since season 2. They should renew Legends. It’s still a pretty fun watch.
All American,Somebody please give a hug to the four people that still watch The Flash. They deserve better.
All American,"Hell yeah, Nancy Drew!!!"
All American,Yes NANCY!!!!!!!!!
All American,The Flash is quickly running out of story ideas.
All American,"Superman & Lois had a really solid first season. I haven't watched season 2 yet. I really hope they hold up, but CW is so infamous for starting off great and turning to shit."
All American,The 4400 reboot is CW right? Any word on that?
All American,Hopefully Legends gets renewed. Not many shows to watch these days.
All American,People still watch the Flash???
All American,"Ratings unnecessary on The CW, which is why the Network itself faces cancellation...some of these shows have -300K viewers per episode. The Time-Life Dean Martin Roasts infomercial probably has more viewers than Riverdale"
All American,Superman and Louise has been fantastic so far
All American,God I can’t wait to see the Nancy/Ace angst play out
All American,oh wow kung fu survived? is it worth checking out?
All American,"""We don't pay people for new ideas, when there's a perfectly good horse to continue beating"""
All American,"Isn't CW network the one that legit hasn't made money since like 2008 or 2009??

Also who the heck is watching the flash, the shows visuals are so bad it looks like CW cut their budget by 3/4 from what it was back in season 1/2."
All American,"Feel bad for that Riverdale cast, it’s like the real show is those actors being tormented in Vancouver forced to work with all their ex’s and terrible writing.

Hope this means Batwoman is a goner since it has finished airing unlike the other shows waiting on renewal, would rather have a Legends final season and a Legacies final season."
All American,"Kung Fu has been surprisingly enjoyable. I watched the pilot not expecting much, and I dug it, so I watched the rest. Still liking it."
All American,Only one I watch is Superman & Lois... for now... it's already showing signs of CW-ness.
All American,"I missed the comma in the title and thought that the show was now called ""Walker Kung Fu"". I'd tune into that."
All American,We lost🤦🏾‍♂️wtf why is the Flash still going on this had better be the last season!
All American,"Wow the CW is really winding down, surprised that SO many shows are on the bubble, and surprised CBS chose to keep Nancy drew over dynasty, which I feel has a strong streaming audience- must be because dynasty is more expensive to make"
All American,"While I liked the Flash, it has gotten too bloated and the same stories over and over. What speedster will be next this season? Wrap it up and finish it."
All American,"The CW needs to end shows, not renew them.

I've been with *The Flash* since the very first Season and it's gotten so bad (holy shit I've dedicated nearly 10 years to these shows). Luckily all signs point towards Season 9 being the end. At some point it reaches *beating a dead horse* territory and you need to know when to end things, even if the actors still enjoy doing it.

I recognize that *Superman & Lois* is loved by many, but I just couldn't get with it. I love Tyler Hoechlin and Bitsie Tulloch, but Superman takes a back seat in his own show, and that bothers me. I'm not a fan of this garbage edgy teen drama with his sons. Smallville will always be my favorite Superman-related Live Action TV series.

I'm surprised *Walker* even got a Season 2 let alone a Season 3. I loved Jared Padalecki in Supernatural but Walker isn't great. Lindsey Morgan also exited during Season 2 (for personal reasons), who imo hard carried this show, so I can't even imagine what this show is going to look like without her.

As for the others: Legends was always so cringe and I never liked it. Batwoman is just awful. And Stargirl is just not good."
All American,And nothing was gained.
All American,"Netflix, take lessons"
All American,"CW, where they refuse to let shows end."
All American,"Bold move seeing how they’re trying to sell this dumpster fire, and the only legitimately interested buyer has expressed zero interest in WB retaining control of scheduling after the sale."
All American,"I hate cw shows. But goddamn superman and Lois took me by surprise, fun show."
All American,Mediocre network renews its mediocre shows big news
All American,"After seeing the quality of content that apple Tv+ and HBO max are putting out, i feel like id have to really dumb myself down to watch a single CW show. Are they just made for teens or what?"
All American,"Superman & Lois is so good, and I hate that people are skipping it because its a CW show. All-American has been consistent since the start, so I'm glad its continuing with the kids headed to college."
All American,"Cw, the network where they turn superheros into soap opera stars"
All American,Really curious if Batwoman gets canned and they pave the way for Gotham Knights to replace it.
All American,"Why the hell is The Flash still getting renewed just end it. Grant Gustin probably wants to move on at this point. 

Also sad that such a bad show like Riverdale gets 7 Seasons (Holy shit) while better shows get canceled for less."
All American,Really flash and Nancy drew? You can do better cw
All American,[deleted]
All American,The flash and Superman are the only arrowverse shows left? 😵‍💫
All American,Nancy Drew jumped the shark a long time ago
All American,"That is very disappointing.

The shows should be in the trash."
All American,is Zelenski the one in the middle? because he's everywhere
All American,Where is the 100 prequel?
All American,Where is my Dynasty renewal!
All American,Nancy Drew! 🥳🥳🥳
All American,"Not surprised in the generous CW lol. I think Gustin reupped his contract before the renewal too and if hes in they are like ""yes."""
All American,Only one of these shows needs to continue.
All American,"I like Superman & Lois, it feels a *bit* different to the whole Arrowverse stuff of before

The Flash run (lolz, get it, run) it's course with me a couple of seasons or so back

I don't mind Nancy Drew but I appreciate the shorter season they just had and hope they do that more rather than go back to 20-22 episodes"
All American,The flash is shit now. What is the point?
All American,Why?
All American,All American is the little show that could.
All American,"What about ""In The Dark""? Love that show."
Whisper,"To have the realization that that you are coming off of a psychotic episode, finding yourself naked in the streets and calling 911, must be a terrifying feeling. I feel bad for someone who has had to go through that. I hope she gets the help she needs. 

Can you imagine being in that situation yourself? I imagine scared and helpless are two major feelings."
Whisper,"Being able to recognize you're coming down from a psychotic episode, flag down help, and get yourself into care is HUGE. Some people will try to play this off as some awful thing but her reaction shows she's putting the work in and making progress. I'm proud of her."
Whisper,"Calling the police on *yourself* is a weirdly rational thing to do, so, could be worse I guess."
Whisper,"I am so sad at what has happened to her. She seemed like an awesome kid, great comedy talent and just had such amazing potential and to see what she's going through is just tragic.

I hope she's able to get the help she needs"
Whisper,"I'm once again impressed with how society has moved forward on talking about mental health.

Everytime I see a situation like this im reminded of the Craig Ferguson monologue about Brittney Spears. The public just pummeled her with jokes and insults while she was clearly suffering from numerous issues at the time. Calling her crazy was not only socially acceptable but normalized. Defending her would be odd back then. But I'm glad we've largely recognized that as wrong and try to sympathize with people like Bynes."
Whisper,"Pleasantly surprised to see the amount of compassion people are showing her in here. Mental illness is no joke, and I'm impressed that she called 911 herself and sought out help. I've known several people who have had mental illnesses and it was really hard for them to accept that they needed help."
Whisper,"One of the SHITTIEST things about some mental illness is that if you take your meds, you feel better. So better, that in fact, you may think you DON'T NEED YOUR MEDS anymore. Vicious fucking cycle.

I'm rooting for her. Damnit.

EDIT: Thank you for the gold kind Internet Stranger!"
Whisper,"Oh no. :(

I’ve shared this before—Amanda’s dad was my family dentist for years and I graduated high school with her older brother. We watched Amanda grow up in pics on the walls of Doc Bynes’s office, eventually seeing her career take off. He had one wall dedicated to her selfies with various stars on the red carpet—I remember Phil Hartman, Dustin Hoffman, and Frankie Muniz distinctly—and it was always fun to see the newest additions to the collection. 

Doc retired when Amanda started her movie career, but not before he spontaneously and rather ominously told me at my last appointment, “Don’t let your kids get into show business, Ruffffian. It ruins them.”

Doc Bynes and his wife (the receptionist for his practice) were always so kind and generous to my family. Doc was particularly tender with my father, whose many health issues made for many dental complications. I know Doc saw my dad more than once on the weekends, when the office was closed. Mom and Dad both talked about how genuinely kind Doc was. He was like a favorite uncle for me. 

Now, I only knew him in one capacity so who knows what he was like as a parent and in other aspects of his life. But every time I hear of Amanda’s mental illness-related issues, and see the media’s feasting on them, my heart breaks for her parents. Well, and her too."
Whisper,"Nah for real they really need to a deep dive investigation into Nickelodeon and what exactly happened there in the late /early to mid 2000s. So many of those kids are messed up. 

Side note - the actress that played Nicole in Zoey 101 was recently seen protesting outside Nickelodeon (or some Hollywood studios) about the treatment they went through."
Whisper,Think she's a great case on why certain people need to be on certain meds or everything falls apart
Whisper,"No matter how rich or popular or famous you are, mental health can affect all"
Whisper,I don't know much about this woman but I know quite a bit about mental illness. My heart goes out to her.
Whisper,"Tragic. She was recently just let out of her conservatorship. I know she’s a long, rough go of it and I hope she gets the help she needs."
Whisper,This sounds like a deeply private and personal matter that concerns none of us.
Whisper,"As someone who grew up watching All That and The Amanda Show religiously and her being one of my favorites in general, this absolutely wrecks my heart. I have no idea what it's like to be completely at war with my mental health in such a way, but my God I truly hope one day she's in a better place mentally and is able to have a happy and fulfilling life."
Whisper,This headline is misleading and doesn’t provide essential context. Asking for help and calling 911 before being found is a whole different scenario than being found naked roaming the streets.
Whisper,I hope her parents step in again and help. At least she tried to get help and called 911 herself. These child stars have a lot of issues when they reach adulthood.
Whisper,"I truly hope she gets the help she needs and is able to live a full, happy, and healthy life. 

Also add, because just seeing where this story generated from: FUCK OFF TMZ. Damn website is garbage, exploitative, and sensationalizes what should be a private moments for people who are in the public eye, such as Ms. Bynes. 

Yes, I realize gossip rags have been around as long as there have been celebrities. But dammit, when a celebrity is going through something like this, a mental health crisis, can’t they just be left alone without what they are going through being plastered all over websites for public consumption and clicks? 

Sorry for the rant. TMZ makes me see red. Plague on our whole society is all that website is."
Whisper,poor girl.  i hope she's getting good care.
Whisper,Psychotic episodes are terrifying for the person involved and the person's loved ones. It's absolutely not something to joke about. I hope she finds the right medication and has a great support system.
Whisper,[removed]
Whisper,So sad.
Whisper,"I don't know what happened, but I had a friend that was arrested because she took Ambien and sleep-walked to a park without pants on and laid down on a park bench. She did the right thing. No one knows her struggle. Let's not speculate."
Whisper,Child actors just can't catch a break
Whisper,"I admired Amanda Bynes when she was a young actor with her own show. I thought she was extremely funny, and looked forward to following her career. It's distressing to see how badly her life has turned out."
Whisper,TMZ can eat a bag of dicks for exploiting her like this.
Whisper,"She’s after “my time” (I’m 55), but certainly familiar with the name. 

Heartbreaking to read. Celebrity, ex-celebrity, or otherwise. 

I truly hope that she’s able to find the help that she needs."
Whisper,"i hadn't heard anything about her in the past few years, so i assumed she was doing fine"
Whisper,Good on her for getting help whilst roaming around and calling herself in to a psych ward.
Whisper,Damn imagine just driving down the road and being flagged down by a naked Amanda Bynes. What a wild way to meet someone you grew up watching on tv
Whisper,"I’m glad she’s getting help. Posting some resources below for anyone in need. ❤️

Whisper,"Poor lady. Her life was ruined by Dan Schneider,  and he's never going to have to answer for his actions."
Whisper,Whoever ran all these damaging fucked up Nickelodeon shows that fucked these kids up needs to be jailed.
Whisper,I wish we could hide news like that. You don’t benefit by knowing about it but these people will have to deal with the news that their mental breakdown was widely known. It’s so sad
Whisper,I hope Amanda gets the help she needs.
Whisper,"Oh man, I was hoping this was a flashback Today in History type post.

She seemed to be doing so well for so long.  But those meds... even if you find the right combination that works, it doesnt last forever.  Eventually the pill stops being effective and you have to find a new one."
Whisper,Man that really sucks I hope she is able to get the help she needs. I feel like she’s been let down a lot.
Whisper,I feel so bad for her.
Whisper,"This made me sad, I hope she finds the path to a happy life"
Whisper,"Man, I hadn't heard anything about her in a long while. I was hoping she was doing better. Wish her the best"
Whisper,"I feel bad for anyone that has to go through a mental health issue like this, and I couldn’t imagine having spotlights on every episode like she does."
Whisper,Ugh this poor girl deserves a break.
Whisper,I'm suprised more Disney/Nickelodeon child stars didn't end up like her considering how predatory the children's TV show world is like... Which is honestly terrible to think but it's sadly true.
Whisper,I hate that this is news. Leave her alone.
Whisper,"Poor thing. She was so heavily traumatized as a child in the spotlight, then blamed for the mental health challenges that resulted. Ridiculed when she needed sympathy, and now this. I wish she could be somewhere safe and warm, with nice sandwiches to eat, and doctors to help her feel better. I wish that were available to anyone who needed it."
Whisper,"Something horrible happened to her….many child stars have come out ok…but her, Linsey Lohan and Brittney Spears …something happened and it seriously messed them up."
Whisper,Hollywood feeds on the abusive destruction of children.
Whisper,Hope she gets help.
Whisper,Aw man i was rooting for her recovery
Whisper,Kid Amanda had some of the best comedic timing ever! I hope she can find the funny again...
Whisper,This is really nobody's business
Whisper,Pobrecita
Whisper,"Amanda please!

I hope she is ok. 
Be ok friend"
Whisper,I really hate that. I grew up with All That and The Amanda Show
Whisper,"No idea why, but I've always had a tonne of empathy for her. I know there are people way worse off and whatever, but I've always just felt really bad for her."
Whisper,"Damn.  This is not All That.  So many of these childhood stars end up messed up, just makes me think no matter what fame and money people dream of, juice is not worth the squeeze for young people who are still developing and are often taken advantage of."
Whisper,How awful. Thank goodness she came to before she was victimized. She must’ve been so scared when she came to:(
Whisper,"Why do we have to torture her more by publicizing it, good work humanity"
Whisper,She and Britney. Feels like 2008 again
Whisper,"I grew up watching her on Nick. Kind of heartbreaking to see her in this state now.

When you’re a kid you think these child actors have everything going for them, the world is their oyster. Completely oblivious to the dark side of the industry."
Whisper,Last I heard she was fighting so hard to stay sober and was gearing up for a comeback. Reading this literally feels so sad...wish she knew how many people are still rooting for her. Addiction is a bitch.
Whisper,"I wish her well. Fuck Hollywood.
Fuck child labour"
Whisper,Glad she could get help. Hopefully after the 72 hrs she can find a more stability and structure to recover going forward. I always liked her.
Whisper,Imagine trusting the police more than your family
Whisper,I really hope she gets the help she needs.
Whisper,Poor girl. This is really sad.
Whisper,I'm so sorry to hear this. Bless her heart. I was so happy to here she was doing better recently. Hope she'll be well afain soon.
Whisper,This is heartbreaking. She had a special place in my childhood and seeing her struggle is very hard. I wish her the best and hope she's able to focus on her mental health
Whisper,I love Amanda Bynes. Poor woman.
Whisper,"One of my biggest fears is not being able to afford my meds anymore and me getting this bad. Nothing like this has ever happened to me, or even close to this but it's terrifying to me that my brain could do something like this."
Whisper,Sarah Lynn? Oh shit
Whisper,It's fucking baffling that anyone still puts their child in hollywood. How many child actors have to end up broken before parents wake up.
Whisper,Now we should just leave her the fuck alone.
Whisper,"It is a sad situation. My brother has bi-polar and other diagnosis. Self-medicated his entire adult life (he's 60). Available care for him in the US is almost non-existent, and he is part of the problem because he is afraid Doctors will take away his ""medication"" or institutionalize him.

Friends and family can't help, even though we have all tried for years. I've watched tens of well-intentioned, but, unqualified friends and family try, and try, and try, until eventually giving up because the end result never changes. Unfortunately, a path of destruction is all that remains. Relationships have all been destroyed, financial and other resources wasted, and I wish I could say he is better today than yesterday, but, I can't.

I wish Amanda the best, and others like her. I actually think this is a good thing - publicly bringing attention to the mental health issues we all have to face in different degrees. I hope this brings visibility to her in a way that improves her life. I wish there were answers for the countless others who are invisible."
Whisper,"If I'm not mistaken, she was recently released from the conservatorship that she was in due to her mental health issues.  I think I remember reading about that somewhere.  (Last year, maybe?)

The sad part here is not that she's worth millions and will be able to get the care she obviously needs, though that looks like it may be a tough road for her.  It's that millions of others do not have a nest egg like that, and they end up homeless and screaming at bridges."
Whisper,"I’m just always going to root for her. She’s so extremely talented and was such a large part of my childhood. Hoping that she can bounce back from this, too, and keep moving forward."
Whisper,"Really sad to see her like this, she had some good movies."
Whisper,Wtf happened to this poor woman when she was a child?
Whisper,Hope she gets the help she needs
Whisper,Jesus “near Downtown LA” man I really hope she wasn’t near skid row or anything. There are some baaaaad things happening around there
Whisper,"This country will continue to make a mockery of mental health and the devastating effects, locally and nationally, of mental illness."
Whisper,Just popping in to remind everyone that TMZ is the scum of the earth.
Whisper,"Way to many people don’t seem to understand the difference between bipolar 1 and 2 in these comments. And also the range of severity on an individual basis. And, my guys, mindfulness and vitamins arn’t going to cut it… mood stabilizers and strict adherence in taking them is necessary.  We are waay to overprescribe with unnecessarily meds at least in the US, but people with legit Bipolar 1 getting the right meds is not one of those cases."
Whisper,Dan Schneider is a piece of shit
Whisper,"Dan Schneider is a fucking weirdo, and everyone should know about him. 

One of the reason someone like Amanda is PROBABLY dealing with this sort of issue, as well as other stars we don't hear about, is because of Dan Schneider.

Here's an LA Times article about his hyper sexual practices at Nick. [Article Here. ](https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/tv/story/2022-08-31/dan-schneider-nickelodeon-allegations-jennette-mccurdy)"
Whisper,Fuck tmz!!!
Whisper,"Ever since she got sucked into Kid Cudi’s crowd she’s been a wreck. Strung out on drugs/pills/whatever and doing all kinds of insane shit. From the little I remember reading about it ~10 years ago, I blame him and/or his crowd for taking her over the edge"
Whisper,"I feel so sad for her, I hope she gets all the help she needs!! Was a big fan of hers when I was a kid."
Whisper,I fear that many of these celebrates i grew up watching and listening to would become our generation's Bobby Driscoll at their end. I pray and hope that does no happen
Whisper,"I hope she gets lasting help, she has been through enough."
Whisper,Hope she gets the treatment she needs.
Whisper,I feel so much for her. I can't imagine dealing with what she's gone through and going through.
Whisper,"Man, the stuff that she's been through is so sad.  I really do hope she gets right, eventually."
Whisper,"Oh, that poor woman.

We should have realized sooner what being a child celebrity does to a person. Too many people have had such tragedies from it."
Whisper,"> After a series of bizarre incidents -- including one where she set her neighbor's driveway on fire

Um, how do you set a driveway on fire?"
Whisper,I'm sad to read this. I thought she slowly was doing better. Wishing her every positive energy that she needs.
Whisper,Get better soon Amanda!
Whisper,"Damn, I was just thinking about her the other day, (after randomly remembering ""meatloaf crunch""), and was wondering how she was doing these days. 

Hope she gets the help she needs"
Whisper,I really hope she gets the help she needs
Whisper,Hollywood takes another former Child star
Insectibles,"I would like to see the same show, except it's about Sommeliers instead.

That would be so much more pretentious that it might just wrap around to being interesting again."
Insectibles,Do they call themselves mixologists?
Insectibles,I’ll sound pretentious myself here. They must’ve paid the foley artist for one day of work as all the pours make the exact same sound
Insectibles,My wife and I were surprisingly entertained. I was intrigued by the elimination round and how sometimes it was just 2 battling but every once in a while it would be 3 or even 4 up for elimination.
Insectibles,"The weakest point of the show is the judging and the judges themselves. They would set the standards of how they would judge the challenge yet would ding some folks on not following the challenge and others would get out OK even though they made the same ""mistake"".

For example, the color challenge... the contestant that had red & green had both colors- technically one of the colors appeared with the garnish. Judges said this was Ok... but he was elimated. Meanwhile another contestant did the same thing (purple/yellow) where she had one color as the garnish and she was applauded for it.

Add the idea that the judges have like 0 personality and it made for a frustrating reality show."
Insectibles,It’s perfect background noise. Not particularly interesting but good to have on I guess.
Insectibles,"My GF watched it and all I could think of was how stupid it was they kept ""deconstructing"" cocktails"
Insectibles,"I actually really enjoyed this show. The only part I didn’t care for is when the judges are obviously reading lines. Otherwise I was impressed with all the contestants and had a good time, especially towards the end."
Insectibles,"We really liked it. Tried out some of the techniques they used during family thanksgiving. We were terrible at it, but it was fun."
Insectibles,"I loved it, it's quirky, the contestants are all interesting. It is also at its core pretentious as fuck. Cocktails are a way to make spirits palatable, that is the absolute baseline. This shit is more culinary than it is mixology."
Insectibles,You have British Bake-Off where when a contestant goes home you feel bad for them because everyone is so nice and likeable and then you have Drink Masters where everyone has to have attitude and drama. I could care less who loses or wins. Didn't make it through one episodes.
Insectibles,"I remember watching someone react to this show. MikeMGTV or something …

The dude on the show put dry ice directly in the drink and he got absolutely blasted for it, and he acted like it was no big deal.

Its definitely a background noise show and nothing more."
Insectibles,"For a less obnoxious challenge show I like Blown Away, about glass artists. Still has some of the faults of this (admittedly) limited genre but it's cool seeing artists doing their thing. I love mixology but I agree that the ""attitude"" this show gives off is just so bad and so common on network/mainstream TV"
Insectibles,"I’ve never heard the word juniper so much in my life. That said, I thought it was interesting. I love the weird competition shows they have like the bbq masters one and glow up!"
Insectibles,"Yea I dont think it rides a line.  Its the classic network tv show, where everything takes 10 minutes to do anything, and there is really only a few minutes of good content."
Insectibles,If it makes you feel any better it is also *deeply* cringey from the perspective of craft bartenders.
Insectibles,">""this is the most pretentious shit ever""

Did you ever see that PBS wine tasting show with Stanley Tucci and Zachary Quinto?"
Insectibles,Was anyone else super annoyed by Suzu constantly crying? I almost feel he got so far out of sympathy. He should have been gone!
Insectibles,"The whole ""there aren't many people in this business that look like me."" statement can be applied to almost anything today. Like bruh, you're making drinks, it literally does not matter what you look like as long as you can get me fucked up."
Insectibles,"20+ years service industry, with a good bit behind the bar.  Near the tail end of my career was when the whole mixology was coming about and it was a good thing.  No more roses lime juice, no more sour mix from a plastic jug; real ingredients that made the cocktail actually taste good.

That being said I hated and still do hate the mixology peeps.  Not a one of these folks could run a bar, you need to know how to take 3 orders whilst stirring, shaking and pouring and then decide which of the 3 to make next.  How to go to the cooler and get the beer you know your regular is going to need next (even though they haven't ordered it) while getting your lemon twists and the manhatten batch."
Insectibles,"It was OK. I found the host to be a bad fit, a lot of obnoxious jokes and puns that just didn't work with the tone of the series that well. 

I do also find it a misstep that Netflix releases even reality competitions all at once. Half of the fun of these types of shows is discussing who you like and dislike, who you think will win, so on and so forth."
Insectibles,Honestly I’m just impressed a dude almost poisoned the judges and he got though to the next round
Insectibles,Clearly you've never watched Bong Appetit.
Insectibles,If they actually had each contestant break down how they make each cocktail before presenting to the judge this would have been a valuable show to get cocktail recipes from and removed a good amount of padding.
Insectibles,"It's great to watch while I'm cooking dinner. I check in every once in a while and say things like ""why are they cooking...food?""

The MC takes a little too much pleasure in booting people, but other than that is a solid dick."
Insectibles,"Watched a couple of episodes. Found it kinda boring and they didn't really show how the drinks were built, no recipes or amounts."
Insectibles,Just because there is more than one minority person in the room doesn't mean they are not still in the minority in general.
Insectibles,"I made it through half of episode one. Pretentious, boring contestants and hosts. I wanted to like it, but couldn’t do it."
Insectibles,"I usually like Netflix shows like this; any kind of skill competition type show. I started it but turned in before the judging or anything. I remember that part - honestly, this kinda show brings those types out no matter if it’s glass blowing, cake baking, or metal working. You learn to get over it lol"
Insectibles,I couldn't get past the first episode.  When the guy put the cocktail with dry ice in front of the judges and they refused to drink it because they were afraid it would kill them I turned it off.
Insectibles,"As someone who can't drink, the rise of the pretentious bartender has been both a good and a bad thing. So many more restaurants and bars have quality mocktails and sodas as an option, but at the same time, you still get some weird looks and some weird ideas. The people who are against mocktails are super against them."
Insectibles,Couldn't get over the promo...the host oozed douchebag
Insectibles,"The winner literally only won because she's black. It was cringe how much they emphasized that in the finale, when she totally blew one of the final challenges. Tao should've won. We are so past the point of bartending being a ""white"" thing, if it ever was.

Edit: why y'all mad? LP was the front runner in the beginning but she blew the finale. She didn't deserve to win."
Insectibles,"""Somm"" is a great doc about people trying to pass the incredibly difficult Master Sommelier certification."
Insectibles,"Unless it had unemployedwineguy, then it would be ok."
Insectibles,"One of my favorite documentaries is called Sour Grapes. It's about this guy who defrauds all these rich pretentious d bags into thinking they're drinking these extremely rare vintage wines, and it's so satisfying watching them get taken for a ride. Check it out, should be on HBO Max."
Insectibles,"I like the word sommelier because it sounds like ""smelly yay"" and so its kinda fitting cos they do smelly yay wines."
Insectibles,[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC6ysvOG1ao&ab\_channel=CharlesBradleyII](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC6ysvOG1ao&ab_channel=CharlesBradleyII)
Insectibles,Real ones prefer Cocktologist
Insectibles,yeah we liked it too
Insectibles,"The judges are always my least favourite part of reality shows, especially when they're trying to be funny or catty instead of being professional."
Insectibles,how about allowing people to make food when it's a drink competition.
Insectibles,On the other hand I think one of the only redeeming quality of the show is the host.  I would watch Tone Bell in more things.
Insectibles,I've always wondered why people need background noise. Why not have nothing?
Insectibles,Imagine going to a bar and asking for a drink and then you have to wait 90 minutes for some smoking drink that has like $60 ingredients in it.
Insectibles,I think you mean “Couldn’t care less”
Insectibles,"That was not true you continued to watch though.

It was not as feel good as Bake-Off of course but it was still on the nice side. Some very minor drama but for the most part people were nice and treated each other well. It was almost the opposite for me that people were talking about made new friends for life when they have been in a couple of episodes together."
Insectibles,"I was watching clips of Canadian Masterchef on youtube, and I couldn’t believe how mean they all
are to each other, so much attitude and drama! the OG (of this format) Australian version, the contestants are all so supportive of each other. https://youtu.be/t0acSsS5A0g"
Insectibles,I don't want to watch a reality competition show where everyone is nice to each other. I watch reality tv for the DRAMA
Insectibles,"I fucking love Blown Away. I knew literally nothing about glass blowing before watching that. I still don't know much, but it's incredibly interesting to watch them."
Insectibles,"Also check out Blown Away - it's about glass blowing, super interesting"
Insectibles,[I'm looking for a gift for my aunt...](https://youtu.be/7MFtl2XXnUc)
Insectibles,"OK I was scrolling all the comments before commenting and it took a while, but YES! Why are they cooking food? What does this have to do with cocktails?!?!? I enjoy the show and can even look past the pretentious snootery, but I can't help but audibly ask WTF this is not a cooking show, I don't go to craft bars and expect them to serve me chicken and waffles with my drink, why would I fault a bartender for not being a chef? Also, it would be nice to have them make regular cocktails every once in a while, no ""add your own spin"", no deconstruction, no gelatin pearls of vermouth. WHO CAN MAKE THE BEST TASTING MARGARITA, MANHATTAN, OR (your fave drink here) ?!?  
/rant"
Insectibles,"I took it to mean outward appearance i.e. clothes, hairstyle, piercings, tattoos, etc."
Insectibles,Right?  Like everyone in the business was in that room at that very moment.
Insectibles,"Dry ice and activated charcoal in cocktails have been linked to deaths.  It's less ""I'm afraid this will kill me right this second"" and more ""this is a dangerous trend in the industry and I won't be supporting it."""
Insectibles,"You opened up a can of worms but we've seen a staggering amount of reality show winners who pretty clearly weren't the 'best' at what they did...however they fit the demographics 'best' so they end up winning.

I have to say it has removed almost all drama in these shows, has really gotten awful the last few years."
Insectibles,Didn't that entire generation of sommeliers end up getting disqualified over a cheating scandal?
Insectibles,"I don't know...the people focused on in that were also strongly in the 'this is the most pretentious shit ever' category, what with the guy getting a separate apartment away from his fiance so he could 'study'."
Insectibles,That's a great title. Are you an expert in cocktails? Roosters? Male genitalia? Some or all of the above?
Insectibles,Tone really carried the judges! Maybe he knew they were lame ducks lol. He was a good host.
Insectibles,Tone Bell? Who was the co host guitar note?
Insectibles,">I've always wondered why people need background noise.

Going from a dorm room with 2 roommates who always had people over to living by myself was an adjustment and having the TV on in the background makes it feel less creepy."
Insectibles,"I have tinnitus, and need some level of noise so as to not be deeply annoyed by the ringing in both ears."
Insectibles,Because being alone with your thoughts is scary
Insectibles,"Because some of us have a tiny monkey in our brains that demands satisfaction and if it doesn’t get satisfaction it starts singing “NEVER GONNA GIVE YOU UP, NEVER GONNA LET YO DOWN” or “CALL 266-8433, BECAUSE THE NEXT BEST THING TO NEW…” at maximum  volume until we give it legal meth."
Insectibles,It's an experience!!!!!
Insectibles,That is a thing. It’s called a cocktail bar. Although the wait time usually isn’t 90 minutes.
Insectibles,"I mean I kindaaaa get this. I definitely wouldn’t wait 90 minutes and pay that much for a drink after.


But isn’t it the same with food? Yes you can say you don’t care about fancy dishes but it’s true that sometimes it’s worth paying for some specialty courses. And it’s not like you eat that all the time. Me and my friends, and especially me are cheap haha. I usually cook for myself and sometimes I’m just happy with McDonalds. But once a year or so we still go and find some good food experience.


But yeah idk. Then again food is still different than drinks."
Insectibles,"They aren't making up drinks from scratch in an actual craft cocktail bar. All the prep work is done, it's primarily just mixing the drink. It takes 5 minutes at most to smoke a drink after it's in the glass. 10 to 20 min wait for the drink depending on other orders coming in. 

Still hella expensive though."
Insectibles,And all that despite good Craft Gin or Whiskey tasting way better than those cocktails on it's own.
Insectibles,This needs to be a bot.
Insectibles,"I like the British version more, just because I can recognize a few people (Mary Berry, Paul Hollywood).

Every cooking competition apart from British Bake-Off and whatever Guy Fieri is doing is horrible, if you ask me, for the simple fact that there's so much manufactured tension. Chopped is the worst for this. 

The sets may as well start literally exploding."
Insectibles,Watched it last night. The purple-haired guy is just a tool.
Insectibles,Australian masterchrf is amazing. We are on the last season of the trio tho. I don't think I'd be able to watch and enjoy the show again with new judges.
Insectibles,"Deborah is so irritating though. Janusz should have won the first season.  (And weirdly,  Janusz should've won the last season of GBBO.)"
Insectibles,I agree. My brother showed me a few episodes and I could not get into it. The drinks were too over the top.
Insectibles,"Well, while I've seen quite a few barkeeps with facial tattoos, lots of piercings and unusual hair, they are still a minority compared to basically normal looking people, so that still fits."
Insectibles,"Then why was it even available as an ingredient?  I mean, I know why, just so that they could manufacture some stupid cooking show drama.

Dry ice has been used in cocktails for decades.  The number of injuries and deaths from it are minuscule, far less than random allergic reactions to other ingredients.  The activated charcoal is a lot more of an issue in my opinion since there is danger of interfering with medications."
Insectibles,"To be clear, LP was my pick for a majority of the show. She just really blew it in the finale. It was so shocking when she won, because I was certain it would be Tao or Kate. It was pretty obvious when they referenced ""people who look like you and me"", for some reason not saying black or POC."
Insectibles,No. That film came out in 2013. That scandal was with the 2018 exam.
Insectibles,Tell me more!
Insectibles,That’s right!!!
Insectibles,I know a guy who did this for the bar exam.
Insectibles,Yes.  Specialization is for insects.
Insectibles,"My thoughts are pretty tame, just that sound the ice cream truck makes and that clip of a monkey sniffing its fingers after itching its butt. And sometimes boobs."
Insectibles,"I hate the tiny monkey. I absolutely cannot sit in silence and struggle sleeping because of intrusive thoughts like these. 

My brain just randomly gets in a pattern of saying ""green frogs, jump logs"" whilst I am trying to sleep. And I dont know why. Its like I get right on the verge of falling asleep and if there isn't a TV om and my brain realises it's quiet it has to whisper in my ear ""green frogs, jump logs"". Like brain it's been 20 years it do be a known fact thar green frogs jump logs. I have accepted this truth you preach to me. 

That and ""JONES BBQ AND FOOT MASSAGE, JONES BBQ AND FOOT MASSAGE"" just echoing in my mind during any brief moment of peace.

I want to be able to sit in silence and not need a TV but then the TV in my brain just goes into overdrive. And im wanting to eat something delciousable down at Jones good ass bbq and foot massage."
Insectibles,"This would be more akin to a Salt Bae version of ""fine dining"""
Insectibles,"If you like cooking shows but want to avoid drama - Masterchef: The Professionals (UK) is brilliant. All the chefs are chefs in Michelin kitchens so the standard is super high - but there's literally no 'I'm not here to make friends, I'm here for my family' bullshit."
Insectibles,I was on the same boat and the first season with the new judges took a bit of getting used to. They were finding their ground and it seemed a bit strange in parts but definitely worth watching. The following seasons have only gotten better after that.
Insectibles,"In the kind of bar that employs someone who they describe as a ‘master mixologist’? 

Because they all basically tend to look like someone’s Sims character"
Insectibles,"There is a very good reason they don't do 'blind' judging for these shows.

They tried it a while ago and it turns out the results are....less diverse.

I look at reality 'competition' shows as just scripted now, just like awards shows.  They edit it to get the direction they want to go regardless of what happens.

Had a friend who was on a dating reality show and they really fucked him over in the editing room."
Insectibles,I know of a famous sommalier who has faked his entire career. It's amazing to see.
Insectibles,"One of the proctors leaked all the answers for the tasting portion of the 2018 exam (widely reputed as the hardest--by a *vast* margin--portion of the 3-part Master Sommelier exam) to two people.

And because the group of test-takers each year is so small and they are all in constant contact each other for study and practice, it was impossible to know how many people got the leak.

And so they just blanket disqualified everyone and made them all retake the test next year."
Insectibles,"TIL

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018_Master_Sommelier_exam_cheating_scandal"
Insectibles,One of these things is not like the other though. The people followed in 'Somm' really came off as douche bags.
Insectibles,"Oh for me it's the quiet moments when I end up silently re-experiencing all my past failures, traumas, and regrets. Oh, and the crushing realization of a rapidly impending, unavoidable death. 

So anyway that's why I have Spongebob on in the background right now."
Insectibles,"All fucking weekend I had the stupid clip of Ryan Reynolds and Will Ferrell singing 'I could blue' playing in repeat in my head.  And it was Thanksgiving so couldn't put music on,  oh no, had to talk with our family who I avoid most of the time for a REASON. I swear I slept half of Friday just to avoid it in my head."
Insectibles,"Just became a real comfort thing after mum died to watch it. I am sure I could still enjoy but the three lads were the comforting background noise to my mourning process this year, I think having no family left I liked having so many episodes of a show with wholesome familiar faces and positive vibes. 

Still enjoy food shows so no doubt il watch. Just sad to lose the little parasocial experience I had to help me through grief a little bit. Just enjoyed so much consistent positivity and genuine passion, made me want to cook and do better."
Insectibles,"Yeah, people within the subcultures where these traits are more common do tend to stick together, and you are displaying one of the reasons for that when you mock them.

Somebody covering themselves in tattoos or piercings or having wild hair doesn't affect me negatively in any way.  Maybe I'll have a private chuckle to myself if I find something silly, but I have no reason to attack them just for existing."
Crime Diaries: The Candidate,"You don't earn a golden globe. The studio buys it. The Hollywood Foreign Press is actually only like 140 people, all publicly known. They also have no rules about accepting payments, or gifts, from studios.The Emmys and Oscars matter because of credible and exclusive voter bases, that are also significantly large enough to protect against bribery. Golden Globes don't mean shit.

There was a bit of a scandal when Netflix paid for many HFP members to fly to Paris and stay in a fancy hotel in order to ""tour the set"" of Emily in Paris. It went on to be one of the worst reviewed shows that year, but still got a nomination."
Crime Diaries: The Candidate,"Not as big of a snub a Rhea Seehorn... I mean holy fuck, I haven't seen anyone as constantly snubbed from these awards since the cast of the Wire."
Crime Diaries: The Candidate,Are we supposed to care about the Golden Globes again?
Crime Diaries: The Candidate,"I was at the Game of Thrones official convention this weekend and he was there. He's so nice and he really loved playing this characters, it means a lot to him.

This snub is outrageous and the Critics Choice Awards also snubbed him. I'm worried about the Emmys now =("
Crime Diaries: The Candidate,"For those curious as to who he was up against

Best Performance by an Actor in a Television Series, Drama

Jeff Bridges (“The Old Man”) 

Kevin Costner (“Yellowstone”)

Diego Luna (“Andor”)

Bob Odenkirk (“Better Call Saul”)

Adam Scott (“Severance”)


Haven't seen old man, but I think Adam Scott, Bob Odenkirk, and Diego Luna all did a fantastic job. Kevin Costner is the one I'd potentially replace with Paddy Considine"
Crime Diaries: The Candidate,Omg what a joke of an award. One of the best performances I’ve seen on TV in years.
Crime Diaries: The Candidate,The Golden Globes has never not been a joke.
Crime Diaries: The Candidate,It’s one thing for him to not win it. To not even get nominated though is a complete fucking joke.
Crime Diaries: The Candidate,Rhea Seehorn too. The Golden Globes are a joke
Crime Diaries: The Candidate,"You win an Oscar, you buy a Golden Globe."
Crime Diaries: The Candidate,"I couldn't believe it when he didn't get the Critic's Choice nomination. I assumed that would be an anomaly. His is, in my opinion, the greatest performance in all of Game of Thrones so far. And certainly a performance that in my opinion exceeds some of the other nominees."
Crime Diaries: The Candidate,I didn't realize he was such a good actor until I saw him playing in HofD. He deserves a big dramatic role
Crime Diaries: The Candidate,Meh. The final season of GoT won so many undeserved awards...
Crime Diaries: The Candidate,"Golden Globes are trash, but it does show how contentious Emmys and Oscars are going to be this year.

Emmys - Better Call Saul, House of the Dragon, Severance, Andor, Hacks, The Bear, Abbot Elementary, some real peak TV with no way to give everyone the awards they deserve, but at least for once Succession isn't going to come in and take up all the air in the room.

Oscars - some really fantastic all-time greats this year including Everything Everywhere All At Once, along with popular box office draws like Top Gun: Maverick and Black Panther: Wakanda Forever and Avatar, and then award bait like Elvis, Babylon, She Said, and The Fablemans.

Lot of folks and fandoms will be going home disappointed, but ultimately just enjoy this great content we all have!"
Crime Diaries: The Candidate,"- you’ve got a moustache


I KNOW"
Crime Diaries: The Candidate,It's the fucking Golden Globes lmao
Crime Diaries: The Candidate,"Kevin Costner was good in Yellowstone, but Paddy was much better. He created something new; Costner is still Costner."
Crime Diaries: The Candidate,"Well, the nominees are not bad, they are all pretty solid. You could argue that Bateman is the odd man out. He is good but Considine's performance was kind of career-defining. It also was like the center of gravity of the whole show, from a dramatic point of view. Like the cleft in a partiture. Every other character's behaviour took its cue from Viserys."
Crime Diaries: The Candidate,"I have been snubbing the Golden Globes all my life , even Academy Awards is pointless now."
Crime Diaries: The Candidate,What is even the point of this awards show?
Crime Diaries: The Candidate,"award snubs are basically a tradition since time immemorial, Paddy is only the last of a loooong list"
Crime Diaries: The Candidate,Crime? Come on now.
Crime Diaries: The Candidate,King Lear levels mate.
Crime Diaries: The Candidate,"You don't earn them, you buy them. You will see that as proof, HBO did not pay or campaign this season."
Crime Diaries: The Candidate,Golden Globes have always been BS. Ever since Angelina Jolie and Johnny Depo were nominated for the Tourist that year everyone was like “wait what?”
Crime Diaries: The Candidate,"Who cares, Golden Globes are a pay to play outfit anyway."
Crime Diaries: The Candidate,Award shows are a joke.
Crime Diaries: The Candidate,"I’ve never cared for awards. The fact that Leo been snubbed for so many Oscar’s proves that none of this shit matters. We all know who the best performances were, and let’s be real here, so do the people who made those performances."
Crime Diaries: The Candidate,"His actual award will be continued work because he is displaying great acting chops.

The Globes don't mean shit"
Crime Diaries: The Candidate,"No it's not, he sucked."
Crime Diaries: The Candidate,Pretty sure there are actual crimes involving the Golden Globes we should be more worried about.
Crime Diaries: The Candidate,"Giving any validity to the Golden Globes is a crime, is a joke of an award, and the organization behind it is an embarrassment."
Crime Diaries: The Candidate,"No, it's literally _not_ a crime."
Crime Diaries: The Candidate,He was incredible
Crime Diaries: The Candidate,"No one cares, it’s all money and nepotism"
Crime Diaries: The Candidate,The HFP members are just the bukake centerpiece of society. Whoever gives them the biggest load wins.
Crime Diaries: The Candidate,All award shows are stupid and pointless. Need me to repeat it?
Crime Diaries: The Candidate,"Critics Choice supremacy. Although, they didn't nominate him either lol.

They went with Adam Scott, Jeff Bridges, Antony Starr, and Bob Odenkirk for best actor in a drama series."
Crime Diaries: The Candidate,"Disagree.  

He did fine, but this show was on the flat side.  Next season should be better."
Crime Diaries: The Candidate,Golden Globes is as irrelevant as the Critics Choice Awards. Oscars is the one to take seriously.
Crime Diaries: The Candidate,lol people still pay attention to golden globe noms? how much more do you need to learn about it to give up on golden globes? whole thing is rigged af
Crime Diaries: The Candidate,All the Major awards are about Campaigning and investing heavily in the award itself through time and money although indirectly with the money. There probably are awards shows out there that pick the actual best of the year I always seem to agree more with the BAFTAs and Saturn is good for what they are looking at but the Oscars have just sucked to watch and for the movies they pick too many times. Saving Private Ryan one of the best Movies of all time lost to Shakespeare in Love that's the Oscars but one thing only needs to be said about the Globes... James Corden won one.
Crime Diaries: The Candidate,"Wtf.

This was the greatest performance I've seen in a long time.

And it destroys shitty LoTR show."
Crime Diaries: The Candidate,"I’m sorry, do people think the Golden Globes mean shit? *Golden Gloves* I get it but seriously, these awards are so far from a joke that we should go full-circle and just call them the Bazooka Joe awards. At least they’d be comically bad"
Crime Diaries: The Candidate,The actors in House of Dragons are very one-note. It’s very monotonous
Crime Diaries: The Candidate,It’s all subjective. I thought he was good but I wasn’t blown away. Not even close.
Crime Diaries: The Candidate,How many times do we have to go through the “people who choose these awards don’t know what they’re talking about” cycle before you just start ignoring the fucking awards?  Some people got together and declared themselves the arbiters of this shit. No one elected them.  Just ignore them and they’ll go away.
Crime Diaries: The Candidate,"Jesus, it really isn’t. It’s a fucking worthless award."
Crime Diaries: The Candidate,"That’s not actually what crimes are…

Great show though!"
Crime Diaries: The Candidate,"No it isn’t, and rich people giving other rich people awards isn’t entertaining."
Crime Diaries: The Candidate,absurd. his performance was incredible.
Crime Diaries: The Candidate,He should have been in a comedy like Matt Damon in the Martian.
Crime Diaries: The Candidate,Even if this award were earned and nit purchased House of the Dragon was no where close to the best show of the year. Maybe for costumes but that's it.
Crime Diaries: The Candidate,"Haven't we learned our lesson with the Oscars? These award shows are nothing but popularity contests. It's a political game, not a an assessment of quality or merit. I don't need a bunch of out of touch snobs telling me what a good performance looks like."
Crime Diaries: The Candidate,His performance just wasn’t that good. It was standard at best…
Crime Diaries: The Candidate,I didn’t find his performance anything special.
Crime Diaries: The Candidate,"Not really, show wasn't that good.

He was fine"
Crime Diaries: The Candidate,Look at the weird way they decided to split the Best Supporting categories for TV
Crime Diaries: The Candidate,All the more reason to not give two figs about the HFP and the Golden Globes.
Crime Diaries: The Candidate,Fuck 'em. Paddy is better than this joke of an award.
Crime Diaries: The Candidate,That’s ridiculous. Best performance of the YEAR.
Crime Diaries: The Candidate,"There was nothing wrong with paddy’s performance, the story was shite. Not his fault."
Crime Diaries: The Candidate,Seemed like a pretty mid acting job for a pretty forgettable character. I guess I'd be shocked if House of the Dragon won any awards for any bit that involved acting.
Crime Diaries: The Candidate,"Just because a you liked some obscure fantasy show, doesn't mean they deserve a international award. Especially when that show was just a cash grab by the studio and added nothing to culture."
Crime Diaries: The Candidate,Meh
Crime Diaries: The Candidate,Is the common opinion that the show was great? I didnt really like it tbh
Crime Diaries: The Candidate,Adam Scott  was awesome.  I'm glad he got nominated for the most underrated show of the year unlike HOTD which was the most overrated show.
Crime Diaries: The Candidate,"Oh, I hadn’t noticed, I thought we stopped caring about award shows years ago…"
Crime Diaries: The Candidate,"I mean, I didn’t think he was that good."
Crime Diaries: The Candidate,He wasn’t THAT good.
Crime Diaries: The Candidate,"Ummmm excuse me, WHAT THE FUCK"
Crime Diaries: The Candidate,[deleted]
Crime Diaries: The Candidate,Not getting nominated for an award isn't a crime.  Shut up.
Crime Diaries: The Candidate,"Really great show, totally killed rings of power"
Crime Diaries: The Candidate,Golden Globe nominations and wins are not worth getting upset about - even worse than the Oscars.
Crime Diaries: The Candidate,The writing on House of the Dragon was a fucking crime.
Crime Diaries: The Candidate,It wasn't even a good show. Why should he win
Crime Diaries: The Candidate,"Much like interest in movies, the woke mind virus also killed whatever interest was left in these pathetic award ceremonies."
Crime Diaries: The Candidate,"that whole season was a crime for watching to begin with. so not much is lost. what a terrible season it was, hopefully season 2 will be better."
Crime Diaries: The Candidate,No. No it wasn’t. Did you see that mess of a show?
Crime Diaries: The Candidate,"House of the dragon should win 0 awards, mediocrity incarnate."
Crime Diaries: The Candidate,"But Kevin Costner, totally deserved it."
Crime Diaries: The Candidate,I kept scrolling thinking there was a mistake and I missed it.
Crime Diaries: The Candidate,Golden Globes are a complete joke and shouldn’t be taken as a prestigious award show in any way.
Crime Diaries: The Candidate,It's almost like awards shows are stupid.
Crime Diaries: The Candidate,Awards shows are and always have been a joke.
Crime Diaries: The Candidate,Yeah one of the all time best performances I have ever seen hands down.  Like ever.
Crime Diaries: The Candidate,"I recently had the pleasure of working with Paddy Considine on the set of his latest film, and I was blown away by his kindness and professionalism. Despite being a huge star, Paddy was down-to-earth and approachable, and he took the time to chat with everyone on set and make us all feel valued. He even went out of his way to help me with a scene that I was struggling with, offering guidance and support. It was a truly unforgettable experience, and I will always be grateful to Paddy for his generosity and kindness."
Crime Diaries: The Candidate,Why anyone cares about rich people giving other rich people meaningless trophies is beyond me.
Crime Diaries: The Candidate,How the hell do you not even give him a nomination
Crime Diaries: The Candidate,Man deserves recognition
Crime Diaries: The Candidate,"Don’t worry, Selena Gomez got her nomination…. But for real…. How?"
Crime Diaries: The Candidate,"Idk, maybe I differ from the Reddit general consensus, and while I like Paddy's acting, I think Matt, Emma, Olivia, and Emily's acting (not so much Milly's) were the standouts much much more than Paddy. Matt and Emma especially."
Crime Diaries: The Candidate,Wow… huge miss
Crime Diaries: The Candidate,"The golden globes mean nothing. They are a fart of an award that is just used to prep for the real deal awards later in the year. Seriously, nobody in the business gives a shit except for studio heads."
Crime Diaries: The Candidate,No it’s not.
Crime Diaries: The Candidate,Omg ...rich assholes and elites arguing about a trophy? Who the F--k cares?!!
Crime Diaries: The Candidate,"Wow solid non opinionated reporting, OP. A crime? Really?"
Crime Diaries: The Candidate,Who cares? It’s a tv show.
Crime Diaries: The Candidate,"""any contest that doesn't go in my favor is illegitimate. """
Carlo and Malik,"Pingu is so popular in Japan that in 2017, they rebooted the series into a new series, called *Pingu in the city*. 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pingu_in_the_City"
Carlo and Malik,"And sadly, he was fired from the show because the original production house was bought by an English company who couldn't be bothered working with a man who couldn't speak English."
Carlo and Malik,"Jeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeesus

Haven't thought about this show in 25+ something years. Loved the shit out of this, quite the impact & fun show without any talking. The animation and over the top stretching/squishing bodies conveyed the story very well!

Twas my shit on TVO Kids back in the day"
Carlo and Malik,Noot Noot.
Carlo and Malik,"For the '70s/'80s kids, Carlo Bonomi first reached fame with the splendid [""La Linea"",](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZC8wnI6XoOY) also done in full italian gibberish. The show had inspired [""Mickey Mousing""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mickey_Mousing) instrumentals.

And there was a [burlesque version (NSFW).](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNjxLcwLxMc)"
Carlo and Malik,Also voiced the amazing Mister Linea : [https://youtu.be/xjbpB2Cjkh4](https://youtu.be/xjbpB2Cjkh4)
Carlo and Malik,"I LOVE PINGU. I discovered the show when I was searching for things to watch on Netflix with my young sons who were 5 and 3 at the time. It was by far my favorite thing to watch with them. My youngest, who is now 9, and I still talk Penguinese to each other.

My favorite episode is  [Stinky Pingu](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sS-J2FTiB3M)"
Carlo and Malik,"The best is the dads trademark phrase FUMI FEFOURRI When Pingu was being a little shit ... 

P-P-P-P, P-P-P-PINGU! PIIINGU!"
Carlo and Malik,I used to rent Pingu at Blockbuster
Carlo and Malik,NOOT NOOT
Carlo and Malik,"Pingu is comedic genius, loved this as a kid.

Also enjoyed that my grandma who didn't speak English could watch with us"
Carlo and Malik,"On second thought, let’s not talk in  Grammelot. It is a silly language."
Carlo and Malik,"Hold the damn phone, there is an actual LANGUAGE in Pingu!?!?"
Carlo and Malik,"“Say that again?”

“Bo-*no*-mi.”"
Carlo and Malik,https://youtu.be/PiM0JyTHNnw
Carlo and Malik,And a Japanese exclusive PS1 game.
Carlo and Malik,"You mean *the* **Pingu in the City**

https://myanimelist.net/anime/38262/Pingu_in_the_City_2018"
Carlo and Malik,"They actually made a new series called ""Pingu in the City"" that was made in Japan."
Carlo and Malik,"Beat me to it.

Noot Noot."
Carlo and Malik,La Lina was awesome
Carlo and Malik,"That was my question, but I don't see anything in the article to suggest it's an actual language with rules or consistency rather than a ""language"" in the looser sense of that's how the characters speak."
Carlo and Malik,In 2017? Seems a little late for PS1.
Carlo and Malik,I meant back in the late 90s/early 2000s.
Carlo and Malik,"I really wish they could of keep this series going,7 seasons is just not enough."
Carlo and Malik,"I got a feeling, I can't let go!"
Carlo and Malik,"Goddamn, I love this show. I wish they'd do a crossover with Lincoln Lawyer. If they don't get MM in there, it will have been a huge wasted opportunity. Or at least get Bosch in the second Lincoln Lawyer movie."
Carlo and Malik,7 series isn't bad in the streaming world but I want more!
Carlo and Malik,"Hopefully something happens this season. They blew it by revealing his mother's murderer, this should have been the way the series ended."
Carlo and Malik,"Carlos Miranda is so fucking beautiful, I might watch that season just for him."
Carlo and Malik,Another great book adaption on amazon is The Expanse.  If you haven't seen that show you really need too.  It's probally the best space show in existence.
Carlo and Malik,"It had a good run. It kind of lost a bit once Bosch solved his mother's death. But Titus and the cast have always made it worth watching. 

I'm guessing this one of those times where the series production costs (Probably salaries) have risen too high. Amazon probably wants to take that money and put it to use elsewhere. It's also the last of the ""Public picks the pilot for series"" format that Amazon tried."
Carlo and Malik,[deleted]
Carlo and Malik,"Not a fan of the shared ""moth agape"" look they're sporting."
Carlo and Malik,I forget did season 5 or 6 get released this year?
Carlo and Malik,I need Bosch telling it like it is for 10 more seasons.
Carlo and Malik,"There’s some sort of licensing problem so the Lincoln Lawyer and MM will never be able to appear on the show. 
I asked Connelly on Twitter"
Carlo and Malik,[deleted]
Carlo and Malik,"It doesn’t feel like seven seasons, they’ve kept the quality completely consistent in my opinion. Feels so fresh still. You can only tell by how much the daughter ages"
Carlo and Malik,"I really appreciate the answer, but good
Goddamnit, it's not the one I wanted. I can still hold out for Titus Welliver to show up in a second Lincoln Lawyer movie."
Carlo and Malik,"I never knew the reason why but knew it would never happen after Money kept showing up in later seasons.

All in all it works and I'm happy enough to be really disappointed that the show is ending."
Carlo and Malik,Maybe someone needs to start a petition to keep it
Carlo and Malik,"That’s true. 
I’m happy when he turns up in anything."
Carlo and Malik,"I think there is one going on Twitter. 
I’m not on there anymore but I’m sure there was one"
Carlo and Malik,Sexually based offenses are considered especially Heinous 
Carlo and Malik,"This comes as no surprise. Marisja takes her role to heart, and actively supports people in real life that the show would consider special victims.

She hasn't done 19 seasons just for a paycheck. She's always seemed really involved and into her role."
Carlo and Malik,I don't think a lot of producers have grandma fetishes. But I've been wrong before.
Carlo and Malik,"> Oscar, Golden Globe and Emmy winner Michael Douglas will receive the Crystal Nymph career honor at this year's Monte Carlo Television festival in June.


> While the actor might be best known for such films as Wall Street, Fatal Attraction and One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, he began his career in television with The Streets of San Francisco in 1972. He recently returned to the small screen with Amazon's The Kominsky Method, which won him a Golden Globe earlier this year. Amazon just re-upped the series for a second season."
Carlo and Malik,Doesn’t this series absolutely shit on the canon?
Carlo and Malik,"Not a fan.   Rewriting canon, taking demons, who early in Supernatural were terrifying enemies that were more than a match for hunters, and turning them into something a teen girl can kill on her own, and turning it into a typical CW young people drama made it unappealing.

The biggest disappointment was that this could have followed John, on the road with two young sons, learning to be a hunter on his own while listening to the music that made Supernatural great."
Carlo and Malik,"I made it 20 minutes before I bailed. As a 37 year old man, I am way too old to deal with this CW teenybopper shit. Carlos is unbearable.

EDIT: Alright, I went back to finish the episode off and it wasn't too bad. I was being too harsh. Yes, the writing isn't the best and it's clearly a teen show, but I enjoyed. I'll keep watching for now at least."
Carlo and Malik,"FFS, the acting in this show is awful. The entire show just feels lame. I don't care about these characters either. I'm an old school Supernatural fan, but I don't think I'll be continue with The Winchesters. Shame."
Carlo and Malik,I am going to keep watching but Meg Donnelly is not a good actress or at least I find her unconvincing.
Carlo and Malik,"holy shit this show is terrible. 

they have a built in fan base and instead make a show for their kids."
Carlo and Malik,10 minutes in and Mary tells John about hunting? I thought Supernatural had made it a point that she kept that part of her life from him?
Carlo and Malik,"only 6 minutes into the show and I'm like storyline is off as well as i feel actor choice slightly off. John was always direct and rough around the edge, but warm/inviting when young as he gotten older and became a hunter he was just rough and direct. This john is sarcastic in a teenager way. I rather they have made John a bad boy for first couple episodes and had him soften up as he gotten to know Mary. Also would have liked Mary to be more secretive. I mean john didn't know about demons until Mary's death right? If they wanted to introduce demons earlier into his storyline...would have made more sense that he saw unexplainable demonic stuff while away at war. I'm just shy of 30 years old and the teenage sarcasm what really irritates me. Somehow sarcasm is flirting to a teen to an adult it is just annoying. This this is just ""inspired"" but not really a look back at john and Mary. I had high hopes."
Carlo and Malik,Can I watch this without watching Supernatural ?
Carlo and Malik,I need somewhere to stream it from NZ ☹️ guess I’ll wait another 2 days till it’s on Neon
Carlo and Malik,"I enjoyed it. I liked the characters. Worried that Mary may get turned into the ""tough as nails Mary Sue"" character. Didn't have high hopes for this series, but was pleasantly surprised and I'm going to keep watching."
Carlo and Malik,[deleted]
Carlo and Malik,Everyone is too young. They have no chemistry. The show isn't funny nor scary. D-.
Carlo and Malik,"I wasn't totally sure about this one. The last few seasons really kind of ruined SPN for me (Dabb was a never ending nightmare of a showrunner). But I love Jensen as Dean and Robbie Thompson was one of the better writers, so I gave it a shot. I quite enjoyed it! Felt early seasons of SPN. And considering how ""LOL canon"" the show became at the end, I'm not worried about that. The actors were a little green but still enjoyable and engaging. And Jensen back as Dean? Yes, please! I'll definitely keep watching."
Carlo and Malik,"It’s more like Nancy drew. Super ‘teenage girl would watch’ storyline does not work with supernatural AT ALL. At the begging of the show I thought, it must be Sam and Deans, woke kids. So it’s futuristic. It’s not. They don’t seem to have any sense about how teens/young adults would act. Not to mention the story line issues."
Carlo and Malik,"I came because I was hoping this was about Dr Charles Emerson's family, I'm a little disappointed."
Carlo and Malik,Enough with the prequel shows
Carlo and Malik,"Popular theory right now is that The Winchesters is either set in an alternate universe (the later seasons of Supernatural established that a multiverse existed before the events of Season 15 brought it back to a single universe) or something is going through and actively changing time in the past (even though that would, to some extent or another, disregard the original show's canon itself)."
Carlo and Malik,"Eh, they'll just pull some handwaving. John isn't supposed to know about hunting until far after this point but he does in this show. But they'll do some simple got his memory erased bullshit in the last season probably to explain that away."
Carlo and Malik,It sure does
Carlo and Malik,"All it takes is for Jack to time travel and tell John and Mary that they need to forget it all, and he can show them a montage of all the things that Sam and Dean accomplish (including the creation of a new heaven), and then Mary will get angry and John will cry, and then they'll accept getting mind-wiped for the greater good.  Heroic sacrifice and all that."
Carlo and Malik,"The timeline has likely been changed, or this is a multiverse variant.

This version of John received a letter from a mystery man. The letter was from John's father, Henry, informing him that he'd likely disappeared, and that the Winchester family were members of the Men of Letters.

The original version of John went his entire life believing that his father had abandoned him, and he had little to none knowledge of the Men of Letters."
Carlo and Malik,terrible take. Hunters and the Men of letters were fighting demons before world war 2
Carlo and Malik,terrible take. Hunters and the Men of letters were fighting demons before world war 2
Carlo and Malik,"The discrepancies are a bit jarring, but Jensen Ackles and the other writers & producers have all assured fans that there's a mystery at play, and they haven't just discarded canon.

Also, even the original series had demons only pretending to be easily defeated as part of a larger conspiracy-plot. It's certainly possible that the protagonists here aren't as effective as they think."
Carlo and Malik,"5 minutes in and I'm watching an incredibly stupid scene where John and Mary and punching each other while fighting a demon. 

I finished the episode and don't expect anything good from this, it'll be another bad tv show to watch and laugh at."
Carlo and Malik,Also 37 here and made it to 24 minutes. I knew it was going to be woke and all inclusive (highly unlikely in the 70's). This show is not going to get a second season for sure.
Carlo and Malik,Individual acting ability isn't as important as overall cast chemistry.
Carlo and Malik,"The acting was also really bad in the first Season of Supernatural.  I think it took at least 10 seasons for Jared to be laughably bad, all the time.  I began to see his bad acting more of a feature than a drawback.  The acting is bad in almost every show where the actors are not seasoned and extremely familiar with their characters.  I don't know how you sat through the first season of supernatural if that's your tolerance level."
Carlo and Malik,"The original was always hit or miss with the casting of woman. Like a lot of CW stuff, it seemed they often just cast for looks. They do it for men too but it's more clear with women because most of the leads are male and I think they do a decent job with the leads at least. Vampire Diaries had good casting though. Especially for villains."
Carlo and Malik,She needs to get the Disney shaken out of her a bit.
Carlo and Malik,That's strange because I actually find John Winchester's actor Drake Rodger passable but she acts better than him. He is very pretty I'll give him that but doesn't have as strong acting.
Carlo and Malik,Yes! I came to see if I was the only one that thought she made Mary’s character unlikeable.
Carlo and Malik,"why they not just make Supernatural 2, or seasson 16?  Shows have ended and came back again, its doable."
Carlo and Malik,"The timeline has likely been changed, or this is a multiverse variant.

This version of John received a letter from a mystery man. The letter was from John's father, Henry, informing him that he'd likely disappeared, and that the Winchester family were members of the Men of Letters.

The original version of John went his entire life believing that his father had abandoned him, and he had little to none knowledge of the Men of Letters."
Carlo and Malik,"There is definitely some time travelling shenanigans going on, something has happened to the timeline.,"
Carlo and Malik,"The timeline was changed.

Yes, the discrepancies are a bit jarring, but Jensen Ackles and the other writers & producers have all assured fans that there's a mystery at play, and they haven't just discarded canon."
Carlo and Malik,"Yes, but I can't imagine why you would."
Carlo and Malik,"It’s CW, so yes because Canon doesn’t matter"
Carlo and Malik,Its probably better that way.
Carlo and Malik,"Yarrr now, set a timer to get money to the creators later.  

Also watch out for Foxtel / Sky who'll just snaffle it.    
It is why Australians are the biggest piraters in the world - Game of Thrones subs pay for our Republican Party equivalent to work on getting our poor systemically killed."
Carlo and Malik,"You're on the internet, use some simple Google skills. Not that hard to find live or after it's aired."
Carlo and Malik,"Get syncler my Friend, everything one in one. Use Reddit, it'll point you"
Carlo and Malik,I enjoyed it too and found it cute and endearing. Much better than expected going in.
Carlo and Malik,Yes! I told my bf this!
Carlo and Malik,"> And considering how ""LOL canon"" the show became at the end, I'm not worried about that. 

Yeah with this stuff now you just have to be cavalier and not give a crap about canon. Can't on any of the other stuff i'm watching, like the new star trek shows, etc. It's the only way you can enjoy it."
Carlo and Malik,"After Kriple and Gamble, Dabb was my favorite showrunner"
Carlo and Malik,"House of the Dragon would disagree with you.

The Winchesters isn't a bad show because it's a prequel. It's just a bad show."
Carlo and Malik,"I have a feeling it'll somehow be a combination of the two.

John mentioned receiving a letter from a mystery man that informed John that his father, Henry, had likely disappeared, and that the Winchester family were members of the Men of Letters.

The original version of John went his entire life believing that his father had abandoned him, and he had little to none knowledge of the Men of Letters.

This may initially seem like simply time travel, but multiversal beings called the Akrida are also mentioned, and they're stated to be a threat to all of creation."
Carlo and Malik,Trust me it's not going to get any other seasons lol.
Carlo and Malik,"He may have lied about that though. I never see anyone saying that, but John wasn’t the most forthright of persons."
Carlo and Malik,"John mentioned receiving a letter from a mystery man that informed John that his father, Henry, had likely disappeared, and that the Winchester family were members of the Men of Letters.

Carlo and Malik,Sure but not before season... 5?
Charlies Colorforms City,Cody please stop spamming your fan fiction everywhere.  Especially when you angrily claim the stuff you say is supported by the show itself.
Charlies Colorforms City,"You sound a bit like a schizophrenic seeking patterns in things to the extreme. 

Either that or someone deeply procrastinating doing their work to finish the PhD in which case enjoy your ABD degree likely in 20 years."
Charlies Colorforms City,His name is Cody Holder and his family is very worried about him.
Charlies Colorforms City,"Nice, typical Reddit comment attempting to troll away from the main content of the post. Thanks for your ‘contribution’ (boring)."
Charlies Colorforms City,Really?
Charlies Colorforms City,"The fact that you don’t see how manic and schizophrenic this post and details reads is disturbing. And mental illness and math degrees do go hand in hand. Apparently even the WW sub has deleted your posts for going from fandom to obsessive.  You literally created a sub for this stuff where you are the only one posting many of these long essays. Really, you could have two PHDs with this level of effort on actual things."
Charlies Colorforms City,Yeah he revealed his name on Reddit which wasn’t very smart of him (and then confirmed it was his name which was even dumber).  He also admitted to not sleeping for literally days before writing that garbage manifesto of his.
Charlies Colorforms City,"Man, I’m sorry but I have have heard all of this mental illness nonsense already and I’m working with many people about it already. If your issue is concern for me, please, you don’t have to worry. I’m just highly enthusiastic about decoding this puzzle that was built for us, the audience. It’s like our own personal maze to navigate here. Along the way we get lost as we fall down the rabbit hole. At the end we find the real story and the tree of life, take from that what you will. 

The narrator of WestWorld is literally schizophrenic. Perhaps that’s what you are picking up on, the story itself is madness and it’s about descents into madness, at least part of it. 

Anyway, I’m here to discuss the details of the show and not my personal life."
Charlies Colorforms City,"He created multiple subs to post this nonsensical trash... AND he posts using THREE accounts at least.  And sometimes his accounts talk to and compliment each other.  It is truly a sad state of affairs.

As for the mania - here is the type of ""logic"" you get from him.  The show is set in 2058 on Earth.  Last season coordinates from an AI monitoring system occasionally would show up in the show.  So Cody here thinks hey, Google Maps in 2020 will give me clues about a fictional 2058.  That's already a leap.  But then what does he do?  He goes to the coordinates, then wanders around and around on Street View or Satellite view, and then is MILES off from the coordinates and comes up with a finding.  

But his findings are insanity:  

\- He saw a city bike rental kiosk (4 miles off from show coordinates) sponsored by Ford the car company and thought it was an amazing finding because a dude in the show is named Ford.  

\- He found a train musuem in Africa and a bus station in Indonesia and this lead him to conclude a company in the show has an OCEAN TRAIN that travels 50,000 miles through the ocean in 2058.

\- He zoomed out and saw a face in a field (more like a vaguely egg shaped silhouette) decided it was a specific character's face, then wondered if there was some conspiracy with HBO paying farmers to draw stuff in fields.  Because some random field looked like an oval / egg.

&#x200B;

Dude is NOT well at all and is completely delusional and in denial of his total lack of critical thinking skills."
Charlies Colorforms City,"I was the one who deleted my WestWorld posts. I was harassed there, doxxed and brigaded, it was viscous. To read the atlas post and associated material, people can find it all on r/WWElevatedScrutiny now.

Edit: I do see how schizophrenic this might appear, especially if you haven’t looked into the google maps coordinates of the divergences yet. It might seem like I’m picking out shapes in clouds here, basically, and inferring meaning from that. Ducking nuts!"
Charlies Colorforms City,">I have have heard all of this mental illness nonsense already

Oh yeah, ""nonsense"" sure thing there Mr. Ocean Train and I Can Hear the AI Talking To Me Inside The Music Of The Show Guy."
Charlies Colorforms City,"I get it now. I thought it was explaining what the “events” on the circle in the show meant regarding the happenings on the show. It seems the ring does seem perhaps to be a time line of the year of the show as he says. I just can’t see what he is saying about those “divergences”. 

The searching google maps is the part that indicates a bit of mania here, but that’s mostly just sad. I was hoping to figure out some cool story about the “parallel realities” that was hidden in the story. But it’s really not convincing other than some stairs that change color."
Charlies Colorforms City,"It’s more that it is a “hobby” that is obviously occupying you for more than the hours most people are awake. Putting off the dissertation work, it seems."
Charlies Colorforms City,"Cody, you spammed the board repeatedly, and used multiple accounts to do so.

People ""harassing"" you kept asking for evidence, kept asking you to explain yourself, and you got mad and would end up blocking people.

And you can't get Doxxed when you stupidly revealed your name to everyone and then rather than try to claim it was an alias admitted to everyone it was your name.  Like that's really really dumb dude.  But of course now you are claiming otherwise.  Your dishonesty is astounding."
Charlies Colorforms City,"Like I get it, there COULD be some clues, some meaning, in the AI Graphical Interface Circle in the show.  Fine.  But that's the last reasonable thing Cody argued and then went off the deep end.  

He thinks there is time travel in Season 3, people living entire lives as other characters, he thinks a phone app in the show is a physical place in the Middle East for some reason, he thinks one character in the show is actually Teddy when the show itself and the cast and showrunners have explicitly said otherwise publicly a hundred times.  He thinks the splatter on the floor from an injured robot is a secret map, he thinks an AI from the show is talking to him through the music of the show.

He's just a bundle of illogical nonsense and is quite obviously not thinking clearly."
Charlies Colorforms City,"It’s true that I’m putting off my dissertation work (I mention this in the introduction of my atlas post). Again, this is a personal detail and IMO (not yours) its irrelevant to the current state of the project. The questioning of mental health and motivations was an early phase of the project that I’ve now moved past. If one aims to discredit the project, I suppose taking a personal angle on why I’m pursuing this hobby makes sense. It might make more sense though, in my view, to observe and organize the data oneself and come up with a competing theory. One could start with the premise that the coordinates provided in the show are relevant to the story, and go from there. Perhaps one would take an entirely different path than I have. Anyway,   Hopefully my hobby doesn’t interfere too much with your Reddit experience."
Charlies Colorforms City,"Don’t get me wrong. I’m with you. I’m just here cause WW.  I actually though when watching it that some of the androids were brought back in different bodies.  I am kinda slow in that show though, so I guess I was wrong in that."
Charlies Colorforms City,">to observe and organize the data oneself and come up with a competing theory.

The show is set on Earth, the coordinates in the show are from the fictional 2058 year Earth the show is set in.  Boom, a bazillion times more compelling than your horseshit."
Charlies Colorforms City,A LOT of people thought that was a possibility at first.  But then the show revealed what occurred.  And everyone but Cody accepts the show (and show runner and cast interviews).  He apparently knows better than everyone who made the show smh.
Selling Sunset,"Not enough three-second Graham Stephan cameos this season made me an unhappy watcher.

Also, it'll be weird if they do another season post-covid considering one of the brothers left the company since it'll change the dynamic of the office, though with just Jason there I'm sure Mary will continue to keep getting all the good listings."
Selling Sunset,It's obvious Graham doesn't want to say anything bad about his co-workers but I wonder what he really thinks of them. Christine is a straight up bitch.
Selling Sunset,Oh shit. Why did the brother leave?
Selling Sunset,"She's the only one of the Oppenheim girls who's been on his podcast channel The Iced Coffee Hour (hell, she's the only one of the girls to be on any of his channels) so I'm guessing they get along pretty well. I believe he's said he stays out of the drama... except when they're filming, in which case he'll try to insert himself into the background while they're arguing so people playing Spot the Graham will see him.

I know his reddit handle and at times I've been tempted to linksummon him to see if he'll ever spill the tea on what he really thinks of them, but he comes off as genuinely drama-neutral so I don't want to abuse that option.

Edit: For anyone reading this thread who has no idea who we're talking about, Graham Stephan is one of the other Oppenheim Group real estate agents who's also a YouTuber with three channels and over 2 million subscribers; he even has his own subreddit here. He appears silently in scenes at Oppenheim Group events/parties (the big Christine/Chrishell fight at the end of season one, the party at Jason's when Romain says he doesn't want Davina at the wedding) and has been in the audience for both Mary and Christine's weddings. It's a running gag among his fanbase to try and spot him in the episodes; there are even a couple compilation videos devoted to spotting him that Graham himself has watched. He's the guy who's roughly as short as the brothers, but [younger and unlike them he still has hair.](https://www.cleveland.com/resizer/d_PDQrDfOUQUDKzBgvbUFCwsa3I=/1280x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-arc2-prod-advancelocal.s3.amazonaws.com/public/LNQI6DTRLJAAVLOATM44YLAZCY.png)"
Selling Sunset,Nothing scandalous. Brett just wanted to start another business and the group didn't need both of them at the office when Jason can handle things himself.
Selling Sunset,I reckon this is clever timing and the opportunity for the Oppenheim name to be consolidated with double the input.
Selling Sunset,"Give us season 2!  
  
Edit: nvm just saw it did come out"
Selling Sunset,"Is this show good? I get a feeling like Kardashians meets The Hills meets Selling Houses. 

I really am on a look out for a show on buildings and architecture"
Selling Sunset,You nailed it. That's just my type of show.
Selling Sunset,"Have to say Christine is not a nice person.  Yes she is over the top with her outfits and purchased hair, but at the end of the day even she has to take that all off and what is left, a really nasty person.

&#x200B;

If I were in LA & looking for real estate I would NEVER use Christine, things do catch up.  My guess is she has divorce in her future.  Would you want to wake up to that every morning?"
Selling Sunset,"I was about to ask how the fuck The Last Dance wasn’t on your list, but I guess it’s not on Netflix in the US haha

I really have to wonder, though, about some of these shows. Netflix obviously tries to push certain content (how are Tiger King and Epstein shows related content to Meet the Parents and Schindler’s List?). But just how many of these shows only appear on this list (or to what degree are the numbers inflated) because Netflix sort of pushes specific shows they want the viewer to watch."

Selling Sunset,Can’t believe Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt did that poorly. Everyone’s missing out on a show that’s as funny and filled with jokes as 30 Rock was. It’s probably my favourite Netflix comedy.

Selling Sunset,Interesting to see containment show up.
Selling Sunset,Those CW shows man. The ratings on tv really don’t matter for them at all.
Selling Sunset,I love this! Any chance we can get Rotten Tomatoes ratings in the chart?
Selling Sunset,"That's great, but most of the ""status"" looks likes a small square."
Selling Sunset,correction... supernatural hasnt finished airing yet.
Selling Sunset,I was a bit skeptical about this idea when it debuted but it’s clear that this was a master stroke by Netflix.
Selling Sunset,"What do the different status symbols mean? What's the different between the ""end"" emoji and the ""check""."
Selling Sunset,Damn didn’t realize Ozark hadn’t been renewed yet
Selling Sunset,How about movies??
Selling Sunset,No Witcher? Wasnt it reported to be like one of the most watched shows?
Selling Sunset,"I guess I've never found it in me to care which shows are popular on Netflix? But upvote for dedication and effort.

My assumption has always been that, in general, shows on any network are cancelled because no longer profitable."
Selling Sunset,You got linked in [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2020/06/13/netflixs-top-10-most-popular-shows-since-the-top-10-list-was-introduced/#78de986432c3)
Selling Sunset,"It literally took over my tiktok page. The videos made under outer banks hashtag have 1.9Billion views collectively

For comparison mandalorian has 400 Million views"
Selling Sunset,If you want a teen soap drama national treasure type of show with bad writing and acting then it’s great
Selling Sunset,Its a pretty good young adult adventure/mystery show - I enjoyed it for what it was
Selling Sunset,"Yes. Outer Banks is basically like The Goonies mixed with The Outsiders (SE Hinton) the last four episodes were insane. I ended up staying up until like 3:30 to finish it. 

The main characters half to deal with the most ridiculous shit sometimes."
Selling Sunset,"I enjoyed it.

But you are not missing out on anything amazing if you skip.

But i dont know your taste in tv, so just i would just check out 1 - 2 episodes and you will see if its for you."
Selling Sunset,"The show isnt like the best show ever, but its good for a teen drama and its not as bad as it could have been. Im hoping for a second season"
Selling Sunset,"Watched it all due to quarantine loneliness. It’s bad, and like 4 episodes too long. 

Pet peeve: The main character’s name is “John B” and everyone says it as much as possible. The dialogue is super stilted every time someone says it, and they sure unnaturally force it in there a lot."
Selling Sunset,"I actually enjoyed binging it. Although it wasn't the best comedy series, I definitely got a good deal of laughs from it and really liked watching Steve Carell and John Malkovich together. They played off of each other really well, and hopefully if they get a second season, Lisa Kudrow will have more screen time, because I think she and Carell would also be great together."
Selling Sunset,"I hope it gets renewed for a second season. This first season was a ***huge*** ""meh"" for me, but hopefully it gives them a chance to flesh out the characters more and figure out what they want the show to be. It seemed like they wanted it to be a drama with humor sprinkled in, but most every joke just fell completely flat for me."
Selling Sunset,"Kimmy schmidt interactive was classified under movies list. But because of it, the TV show also got a boost up and got in the list. It is extremely unusual for a Netflix original to trend after its release hype and between next season."

Or rather relatively least profitable.

Even if a network only had profitable shows, they may cancel the weakest one(s).  Or if a network had only a few hits, a few duds may stay, because they perform better than 60% of their line-up."
Selling Sunset,Damn this journalist didn't even ask for my permission
Selling Sunset,"I might actually check it out. Missed it, but have been waiting and asking for something in the mystery-treasurehunter-vacation-crime-drama whatever genre for years. Looked more for either Castles Nathan Fillon or James Bond Daniel Craig ex-cia tonality than... teen drama, but maybe it scratches the itch just a little bit."
Selling Sunset,"It has surprising rewatchability, even though the writing is meh. It has potential, but they need figure out the side characters way more. The hand shaking invention story was fucking hilarious"
Selling Sunset,"I've posted this elsewhere in this subreddit, but it's interesting to me that Greg Daniels' other new series, Upload, does the same mixing of comedy and drama, yet does it far more naturally to me. I can see a similar signature in both series, yet one (Space Force) totally flops on it. I'm guessing it's a combo of different writing teams and directional / editing styles (I think SF has more of a drama directorial style all around, while Upload seems to be able to shift the direction and editing to set up the jokes better). Enjoying Upload far more than SF, even with SF having a more stacked cast. If it weren't for the cast of SF I don't think I'd even bother to finish it."

Selling Sunset,"> which are just licenses from third parties

Most Netflix Originals are that.   For example House Of Cards or Orange Is The New Black were that too.

Netflix barely produces any series themselves or owns them."
Selling Sunset,[deleted]
Selling Sunset,"> There is technically a fourth option where some stuff is exclusive to Netflix either everywhere or in some countries but isn't marked as an Original for some reason

My guess (and I would bet money on it) is this:

Netflix Originals are shows, in which Netflix is part of the ordering parties.  Netflix was part of the networks that ordered the shows, or maybe jumped in later for new episodes (for example Orphan Black).  

That is different to shows which were already ordered or underway, before Netflix picked up the option."
Selling Sunset,"Vikings and Ozark are not on the list because you did not enjoyed or because you never watched?

I love Game of Thrones,The Last Kingdom,The Handmaid's Tale and Westworld from your list.
Unpopular but i also enjoyed Cursed,It was fun to watch.
Season 4 of The Walking Dead was one of the best seasons in my opinion,If you disliked that season you would have hated some seasons in the future."
Selling Sunset,Big Mouth is 10? That's seriously the worst show I've ever seen.  I always wondered who exactly watched that.
Selling Sunset,How is Ted lasso not a 10
Selling Sunset,Bob is awesome! Love that show!
Selling Sunset,"If you subtracted 5 from each rating and went an ""* out of 5"" rating system instead, it still would be about the same."
Selling Sunset,"Half of Game of Thrones (seasons 1-4) is a 10/10 show and the other half of it (seasons 5-8) is a 2/10 show.

So averaging them together, the show gets a 6/10."
Selling Sunset,Breaking Bad but no Better Call Saul?
Selling Sunset,Ewww Chrishell and Christine are both bad. Mary all the way.
Selling Sunset,"Vikings and Ozark are on my list to watch! As for TWD I think I may have stopped after 3rd season? I don't remember as it was a while back but will definitely have to resume. I forgot to add to this list but the new show Invincible is really, really good and is made from the same people as TWD, highly recommend."
Selling Sunset,exceptional in its 1st season and hits different but 10/10 is hard to hit for me and should be reserved for the absolute best that couldn't have been better
Selling Sunset,😑
Selling Sunset,"if he multiplied each rating by 13.8 and did a “* out of 138” rating sys, it would also be about the same"
Selling Sunset,"It definitely got worse in the later seasons but for the most part it was still pretty epic, quality, or maybe I was just so invested at that point (sunk cost). Either way still an amazing show but I get where you're coming from"
Selling Sunset,Simply haven't seen but I hear it's as good as if not better than BB
Selling Sunset,Mary is indeed the most mature and apparently carries the load in terms of earnings for the O group. the favoritism seems to only be for drama as she has actually earned her place at the top.
Selling Sunset,"If you like Ozark, check out Justified."
Delhi Crime,"Imo, Sacred Games was the first series with some really quality writing & streaming In India kept growing since then. 

Scam 1992 Is another marvelous show with quality writing & acting."
Delhi Crime,"> BBC Studios India is also active in this space, working with Applause on Hindi versions of Criminal Justice, Luther (Rudra: The Edge of Darkness) and Guilt (Bloody Brothers). Separately from Applause, it has produced local remakes of Doctor Foster (Out of Love) for Hotstar and Press (The Broken News) for ZEE5. 

> The proliferation of remakes is not surprising, as both the streamers and producers are currently focused on speed and volume. “There’s so much demand for premium content, and everybody wants it fast, so formats become an easy turnaround for the streamers,” explains Sameer Gogate, head of BBC Studios India’s production business.

> In most cases, this means the potential for international distribution of these shows is limited, due to holdbacks in markets where the original English-language or other language versions are still on air.


The bigger problem with Indian remakes of foreign shows that they tend to be copy/paste remakes. 


I’ve seen Indian remakes of two Israeli shows, Your Honor (Kvodo) & Hostages (Bnei Aruba). The Indian versions were just copy/paste, not just the main plot/characters but even the dialogue. They didn’t add anything meaningful to the remakes that make them stand out from the original shows."
Delhi Crime,Made In Heaven season 2 when?
Delhi Crime,I don't think there is a genuinely great Indian streaming show yet. Even sacred games was just mid.
Delhi Crime,"There's Delhi Crime, Paatal Lok, Rocket Boys and The Family Man too."
Delhi Crime,Scam 1992 has some really great writing.
Delhi Crime,"Yeah India still does movies way better than series, especially the South Indian movie industries. I've seen Malayalam movies rise in popularity very steadily and rightly so. They've been making some of the best story driven content in India."
Delhi Crime,Of course but I think Scam 1992 has some impeccable writing with extremely well-written dialogues & amazing storytelling.
Delhi Crime,Mirzapur too.
Delhi Crime,Mallu movies are awesome. Best in the country imo
Delhi Crime,"As someone who doesn't know a single word of Malayalam, I gotta agree with you on that."
Delhi Crime,I’m really looking forward to this. S1 was so good!
Delhi Crime,"one of the best and most authentic crime shows i have seen, period. if anybody is looking for an actual underrated show, this is it."

A must-watch though. 4.5/5"
Delhi Crime,Same. I finished both seasons this month.

Delhi Crime,Doesn't seem so. Can't talk about this show with other fans :(
Delhi Crime,Watched a documentary about this. It was sickening. 
Delhi Crime,My best guess is that Indian intimidation mobs will try to silence this. I hope I'm wrong.
Delhi Crime,Have the name of the documentary? 
Delhi Crime,"You are wrong. And my best guess is if you watched it you would hate it because it shows how the Delhi police did everything they could to bring the culprits to justice, despite their limited resources. I hope I'm wrong."
Delhi Crime,India's daughter. The description of the attack and her injuries are quite graphic. 
Delhi Crime,"Episode 2: DCP Vartika Chaturvedi works to solve the most important case of her career: The Case of the Dysentery. [spoiler](#s ""The murders were the thousands of people shitting in the river"")."
Delhi Crime,Your sarcasm is legit. Given  that most of the Oriental production is regurgitated Western sensibilities it's hard to take it for more than it is: exotic setting. 
Delhi Crime,"I’m glad they’re investing more in non-American shows. Dark, Babylon Berlin (not officially Netflix, I know), Sacred Games and Kingdom have all been awesome along with some of their British shows. Hopefully that one Lebanese show they’re producing will air soon. "

Delhi Crime,"Prime has surpassed Netflix in creating originals for India very handsomely. Their TVF produced Panchayat is a breath of fresh air, and is very reminiscent of late 80s-90s Indian TV."
Delhi Crime,"> Prime has surpassed Netflix in creating originals for India very handsomely

Huh?  Netflix releases originals from India like every week."
Delhi Crime,"From what I have seen, they generally don’t have the quality that Prime has."
Delhi Crime,"Then you're watching the wrong ones.  Netflix beats Prime in both sheer numbers and the number of high quality shows.       
  
Also you originally said that 'Prime has surpassed Netflix in creating originals for India' which is untrue.  If you're now saying that they have *better* originals, that's more subjective but also still not really true.    
  
Don't get me wrong, Paatal Lok is a good show, I really liked it but Netflix has Sacred Games, Dehli Crime, She, Breathe, Bard of Blood, Ghoul, Betaal, Typewriter and so many more.  Prime has a few decent ones but nowhere near as many."
Delhi Crime,Breathe is from Amazon.
Delhi Crime,"I mean quality. And other than Sacred Games, that too only for a bit I have not liked any of them. Its far too wannabe in my opinion."
Delhi Crime,"Well again, that's subjective but they both have high quality shows.  I would say they might be neck and neck but there is no way that Prime 'eclipses' Netflix."
Delhi Crime,"No idea why you're getting downvoted, but you're right. Prime has a better catalogue of non-original Indian films, but originals series/movies goes to Netflix. Even though I don't care for most of them, stuff like Delhi Crime and Sacred Games are on another level from Prime's next best series like Mirzapur."
Most Beautiful Thing,I'd really like Bill Nighy to narrate a portion of my life. 
Most Beautiful Thing,That man was born to play Vincent Van Gogh 
Most Beautiful Thing,Bill Nighy is dressed like Bill Nye.
Most Beautiful Thing,"This is, without a doubt - my favorite Doctor Who episode. It is what made me fall in love with Matt Smith’s Doctor. And why he will likely be my favorite rendition of the character. 

While Tony Curran’s portrayal of Van Gogh is unparalleled. Matt Smith’s Doctor, and Karen Gillian’s Amy Pond are just as imperative to the story.

When we meet Van Gogh at the beginning of the episode, he is a penniless drunk - and the town’s joke. He only sold one painting in his lifetime, and struggled with mental illness until his suicide at the age of 37. While there is much debate of the effect his mental illness had on his late paintings, his art expresses that he was at the peak of his ability, and completely in control - longing for concision and grace. 

Understanding Van Gogh takes more than an appreciation of his art. He frequently wrote his younger brother, Theo - who provided Vincent primary emotional, and financial support. These letters provide us insight into why Vincent painted, not just for the love of art. But for the love of nature, color, and what he believed to be a necessary response to his torment.  

One of my favorite quotes from his letters to Theo states “I long so much to make beautiful things. But beautiful things require effort—and disappointment and perseverance.”

Van Gogh produced over 2,100 artworks in his lifetime, his best-known in the last two years of his life. He had such a command of color because he saw things beneath the surface. I believe that he saw these things because he looked for them, not just because he was gifted. 

In another letter to Theo he wrote:  “At present I absolutely want to paint a starry sky. It often seems to me that night is still more richly coloured than the day; having hues of the most intense violets, blues and greens. If only you pay attention to it you will see that certain stars are lemon-yellow, others pink or a green, blue and forget-me-not brilliance. And without my expatiating on this theme it is obvious that putting little white dots on the blue-black is not enough to paint a starry sky.” 

In this episode, Vincent is able to see something that Amy and The Doctor, and even the viewer cannot. We are only able to see it through his portrayal. Not only that, but Vincent has insight into Amy’s loss, even though she is not aware of it herself. 

Vincent takes the Doctor and Amy’s hands at the end of the episode, and shows them the way he sees the world. 

Vincent: “Hold my hand, Doctor. Try to see what I see. We’re so lucky we’re still alive to see this beautiful world. Look at the sky. It’s not dark and black and without character. The black is, in fact deep blue. And over there: lighter blue and blowing through the blues and blackness the winds swirling through the air and then shining, burning, bursting through: the stars!”

[the sky gradually transforms into van Gogh’s painting Starry Night]

Vincent: ”And you see how they roar their light. Everywhere we look, the complex magic of nature blazes before our eyes. It seems to me there’s so much more to the world than the average eye is allowed to see. I believe, if you look hard, there are more wonders in this universe than you could ever have dreamt of.”

The Doctor: “I’ve seen many things, my friend. But you’re right. Nothing’s quite as wonderful as the things you see.”

While the Doctor and Amy are able to save Vincent from the danger at hand, they are unable to save him from himself. Amy spends the majority of the episode hoping that time can be rewritten, and that Vincent will live a long life since they “saved” him. However, when they return (without Vincent) to the present - Amy despairs that there aren’t any new Van Gogh paintings. She turns to the doctor with tears in her eyes and says: “We didn’t make a difference at all.”

The Doctor turns to Amy, embraces her and says:

“I wouldn’t say that. The way I see it, every life is a pile of good things and bad things. The good things don’t always soften the bad things, but vice-versa, the bad things don’t necessarily spoil the good things and make them unimportant. And we definitely added to his pile of good things.”

I find myself on both sides of this story. There are times when I feel tormented, and I will never be understood, or appreciated. I battle not giving into despair or the sickness I feel inside myself. There are times I feel that I’m sacrificing my sanity for powering through, or pulling myself out of bed on days when I simply do not want to exist. 

Then there are times when I meet someone else in the midst of their despair. I recognize it immediately, and I want to save them. Perhaps some of that is empathy, some of that is hope that I can be saved myself. Of course, the problem is that we can’t save anyone from themselves, no matter how badly we want to. 

I have some friends who used to be in (addiction/alcoholism) recovery (like myself) who I try to call every couple of weeks. So often I wish I could just go over to their apartment, or drag them out of a bar back into a meeting. Not to shame them - but because I care about them. 90% of the time, when I call my friends who are still battling alcoholism, addiction, or depression I get their voicemail. I always leave a message telling them that I care about them, that I love them, and I’m available if they ever want to talk. Out of the 200+ voicemails I’ve left this year, I’ve been called back twice. And when they do answer, they are normally frustrated, angry, bitter, or too busy to talk. 

I think that it’s important not to expect anything in return for our compassion, or love. We want so desperately to be able to make a difference, and we count everything as a loss if we feel that we don’t.

It’s important to know that you can make a difference, and it still matters even if you can’t save someone from themselves (in the end). 

So often, we consider a single defeat to define us, or others. But when I look at Van Gogh, as tragic as his suicide was - his art changed the world. It changed me - it speaks to, and comforts me on a regular basis. And that is more than a victory against death. 

I know it’s hard to see past our own lifespan, or the lifespan of others. But I promise - when you make something that lasts, when you pour your heart and soul into something - it will speak longer than you ever could. 

We can always make a difference. 

EDIT: (Sept 6th, 2016: 5:38 PM EST): Wow, thanks everyone. I wrote this analysis a couple months ago, and when I saw this post I thought it'd be a good place to share. I never expected this kind of response - thank you all. I'll try to respond to each message directly later tonight. "
Most Beautiful Thing,"This was the most real depiction of depression I ever saw. The scene where Van Gogh's just like ""Yeah, you gotta go, I got stuff to do, bye."" And the second he was out of sight he was facedown in his bed, face buried in a pillow, an ugly sobbing mess.

I've been there so many times. Where I keep it together in front of people, retreat to my room, lock the door, and take a dive."
Most Beautiful Thing,"If you want to cry even more, watch the scene [after they return him to his own time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9HkCHjnPnU).

First one just primed the tear ducts, this one opened the floodgates"
Most Beautiful Thing,I'm not crying its just raining on my face.
Most Beautiful Thing,David Tenant Dr. Who can be really touching. The last episode with Donna had me crying quite a bit. 
Most Beautiful Thing,"A fabulous episode, and the performance by Tony Curran is amazing."

Most Beautiful Thing,"That song is Chances by a London band called Athlete. They're decent, have a few great songs especially Wires and are along the lines of stuff like Keane, Travis, Elbow, Doves, Puressence, etc.

For anyone interested in learning about more modern British rock, check /r/UKbands, there's better stuff than Athlete for sure. Anyways, great scene this, imagine working your whole life at something which you're never recognized for and then to suddenly see it in a museum."
Most Beautiful Thing,Is doctor who worth a watch? I've genuinely never heard of it but this was beautiful 
Most Beautiful Thing,"I know this is going to get buried, buti just wanted to say how important this episode is to me.  This episode convinced me to finally seek out help for my clinical depression.  

I realized how much Van Gogh's depression made him not realize how talented he was.  Even when he did get to see what his work would become, he still eventually killed himself, and I realized that would be me too some day.  I'm so glad I got help.  

I may not watch Doctor Who much anymore, but that show probably saved my life. "
Most Beautiful Thing,"I remember reading that this episode ended with a depression/suicide hotline number. What a beautiful touch.

---

*SUBSCRIIIIBE*"
Most Beautiful Thing,"I think equally as imporant is their conversation after about how even though they showed this is Van Gogh it didn't chamnge history.  Sadly, something there is nothign you can do for a person to ""save them"" like Amy was hoping for.  Tragic but beautiful episode."
Most Beautiful Thing,Just realizing Bill Nighy and Tony Curran are in the underworld film series..
Most Beautiful Thing,Doctor Who is one of the few shows that consistently produces some of the most tear-jerking scenes in television.
Most Beautiful Thing,"my god.. not gonna lie, those alien things kinda scared the crap outta me. "
Most Beautiful Thing,Just thinking of this scene brings on the feels. It's one of my favorite Doctor Who episodes by far
Most Beautiful Thing,"The first time I watched this episode, I had a day off from college, I was enjoying a bath and drinking some wine while playing it off my laptop. I cried like a little bitch."
Most Beautiful Thing,"This is my favorite episode of Doctor who and it contains one of my most favorite quotes of all time: ""The way I see it, every life is a pile of good things and bad things. The good things don’t always soften the bad things, but vice versa, the bad things don’t always spoil the good things and make them unimportant."" I live my life by this quote and it has helped me get through some dark times. Truly beautiful this episode is."
Most Beautiful Thing,"It's made sadder when you realize that he still commits suicide in that episode, because depression isn't a disease that a good day can cure, even realizing that you are going to become the greatest artist in history, that you will redefine the very nature of art doesn't make the pain stop. You can hide it away, you can fight it, but it's still there, and it's still horrible, and for that... that I give Doctor Who Credit. 

[This Scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh78KWOkiGE&t=1m54s) remains my all time favorite part of the Doctor WHo universe. Perhaps it is the music, perhaps it is the poem that is being recounted, the camera work... all of it just comes together for me. "
Most Beautiful Thing,What is it with modern TV shows and making music so prominent in scenes? This felt more like a music video than a scene in a TV show.
Most Beautiful Thing,"Agreed.  Can't believe he was the villain in Elementary.
"
Most Beautiful Thing,"It's a scene with beautiful intention and I love the guy who plays Van Gogh, but the use of that music almost ruins it, and combined with the unnecessary declaration of Van Gogh as ""one of the greatest men in history"" really keeps this scene from being as great as it should have been. "
Most Beautiful Thing,"I made the mistake of showing this episode to a group of guys I wanted to introduce to Doctor Who. I'd never been able to get through the episode without crying before, but I was convinced I wouldn't cry in front of the guys. I did, during the scene you linked to here, and it was horrifyingly awkward. Never doing that again. But it's such a beautiful moment, it really touches my heart."
Most Beautiful Thing,Lots of cheese with a side of corn
Most Beautiful Thing,"Wait.. so it's pronounced like ""Goff"" instead of ""Go""?"
Most Beautiful Thing,lol why is this always on the front page
Most Beautiful Thing,I've never seen this on the front page of reddit before.
Most Beautiful Thing,"oh, my hearts"
Most Beautiful Thing,"ok after that Dr Who speech on War and now this clip, fuck I'm so starting this show damnit"
Most Beautiful Thing,I HATE that it's not on Netflix anymore. 
Most Beautiful Thing,Fake still have both ear
Most Beautiful Thing,Reddit sure loves their schlocky over sentimentality.
Most Beautiful Thing,this is cheesy as fuck
Most Beautiful Thing,You should watch more tv
Most Beautiful Thing,"As someone who knows very little about doctor who.... I never expected a scene like this

I thought it was all whacky scifi battles against aliens and robots "
Most Beautiful Thing,Why is this a link to nothing?
Most Beautiful Thing,Hmm. This makes me want to check out Doctor Who. Thanks for sharing :)
Most Beautiful Thing,This is what got me to watch the show. Ended up being way better than I expected. All I knew of it was the cringy Tumblr posts and it shattered that view. 
Most Beautiful Thing,I am an avid fan of Van Gogh but have never seen a single episode of Doctor Who. I will now be watching.
Most Beautiful Thing,"As a screenwriter who has never sold anything, this scene means everything to me. It encourages you to keep trying even when you haven't had any success, because you never know. Sometimes success comes very, very late, as it did for Van Gogh. "
Most Beautiful Thing,"I saw this clip and started to watch Doctor Who. The series is like a roller coster of ups and downs. But the ups are always greater than the downs and when they come you'll realize why you keep watching. 

On the top of my head:

[Blink](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwdbLu_x0gY): 
The weeping angels could be one of the simplest ""monsters"" on film and yet one of the scariest. Don't blink. Fans of SCP Containment Breach will be happy.

[Gridlock:](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Hd6QVhjCvM) They visit a planet where people are stuck in an underground traffic jam.

[The Rings of Akhaten:](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoVLhUxhdSw) The doctor delivers a speech that just hits your fandom right in the chest. Perfectly placed after 7 seasons. ""I've seen things you wouldn't believe""

[The Loger:](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJJ77iKNO9s) The Doctor needs pose as a normal person and gets James Corden as a roommate. 

Digging deeper there's just a million great things about this show. My favorite things are not some specific episodes. It's the combination of subtle humor and serious scenes like the one here with Van Gogh."
Most Beautiful Thing,"Brought to tears over it myself many times. One of the largest little things the Doctor did. Might have caught me in a moment but it got me again. There's something about Doctor Who with Matt Smith when I saw it the first time, and apparently the following times. This episode or Matt Smith's denouement are my favorite moments in entertainment, as in all of it. Amongst Lion Kings, Star Wars and Treks, Hogwarts and Raistlin... The Doctor rules, especially Matt."
Most Beautiful Thing,"this had me bawling the first time I saw and every time since. The concept off seeing your own immortality, of truly seeing you being loved and honored so long after you are gone, and assumed forgotten. I'm at work so I had to stop watching or else I would have full blown tears on my face. So sweet and another reason why Doctor Who is the best show of all time."
Most Beautiful Thing,"One of my favorite episodes. The feels yo.. 
"
Most Beautiful Thing,"Jesus really? This is the ""most beautiful thing"" on TV? Is Coldplay your favorite band? This is some of the corniest shit ever produced."
Most Beautiful Thing,Van Gogh was irish?
Most Beautiful Thing,The man who knows all about Van Gogh doesn't recognize him in the flesh - Manet
Most Beautiful Thing,"Now I'm interested in watching doctor who.. Can anyone give me very quick and brief premise of the show and let me know what season to start (preferably a more recent season).


Edit: wow, less than a day after asking this question my inbox blows up. Relatively new to Reddit so this kinda response really surprised me. Thanks for the help. Reddit community take this W."
Most Beautiful Thing,"To lovers of art, this episode was truly moving. To people who aren't lovers of art, this episode was truly moving. 

Basically, it was a pretty rad episode. Exploring a well-known staple in modern art, imagining the reasoning behind his actions, seeing first-hand how an artist was viewed in that period of time, forming a relationship with his character, and also showing how others viewed any mental illness in the not-so-distant past. It didn't matter if you were an art-lover or not, it opened your eyes to how being a little different, in any capacity, has changed with time. It has become more accepted, less persecuted, to differ from societal norms, than any other time period before us. With as big of a topic as bullying is becoming in modern age, I think we forget that just a hundred years ago, people would publicly watch other humans be hung; for no reason that we would justifiably agree on in 2016. For our ancestors, being exponentially brilliant in anything could be viewed as insanity, witchcraft, or being irrational. Shows a different view on his artwork, and life in general. Doesn't matter if you were a fan before, it made you look at his artwork in a completely different way. "
Most Beautiful Thing,You know the acting and the set up of a scene is good when you know its a show but actually feel like youre watching the real Van Gogh react to this. It a shame there was a little dust in my eye while trying to watch this.
Most Beautiful Thing,Beautiful son by Athlete
Most Beautiful Thing,Fuck this scene and fuck this show. 
Most Beautiful Thing,"Ugh with the title of your post

Next week another Reddit user will talk about how some other show is the most beautiful best scene ever... Just stop it. "
Most Beautiful Thing,This is the episode that made me a fan!
Most Beautiful Thing,"The video plays a great scene and really pays off when you see his reaction.  It builds such a delightfully satisfying ending...then the two aliens with a fucking ""subscribe"" button pops up.  Fucking ruined it."
Most Beautiful Thing,"I had to watch some type of sci-fi show and write a paper about it for a college class. So I picked Doctor Who because so many of my friends were bat shit crazy for it. Picked this episode randomly and I fell in love with Amy and The Doctor. Smash cut to the rest of the year catching up on every (new) season of Doctor Who. 

I can honestly say if I had chosen a different episode to watch I don't think I would have become such a fan of Doctor Who. Tony Curran (Van Gogh) is basically  the reason for my obsession with the show. "
Most Beautiful Thing,That whole season (basically all the pond years tbh) was a fucking masterpiece 
Most Beautiful Thing,Thinking about starting watching Doctor who. What season should I start? Sorry if this isn't the right kind of comment for this sub.
Most Beautiful Thing,This is easily my favorite episode of Doctor Who and none of my friends that watch the show see why I love it.  They all disliked the episode.  It was one of the most touching episodes and this end scene made the entire episode worth it.
Most Beautiful Thing,This honestly gave me chills 
Most Beautiful Thing,"yeah, this scene made me cry like a baby the first time. also, the second time, come to think of it. also, i'm crying right now."
Most Beautiful Thing,Can not up vote this enough. So beautiful. 
Most Beautiful Thing,This episode means so much to me.
Most Beautiful Thing,Whenever I see someone talking about this scene I immediately jump in. It's such a gorgeous and well thought out piece. I even like to ignore reality for a while and pretend it actually happened to Van Gogh.
Most Beautiful Thing,"Ah, my favorite kind of time travel. Bringing people from the past to the present. It's so rare though. It's always present going into the future or going into the past, or future coming to the present. Those never feel as real though."
Most Beautiful Thing,Have never watched this show.  Wow.  I have no words (these few notwithstanding).
Most Beautiful Thing,"I remember this scene, and before I even clicked I told myself, ""Ugh, this is gonna make me cry.""

Did not disappoint. Every hair is now on standing on end. "
Most Beautiful Thing,Someone cutting onions in this motherfucker...
Most Beautiful Thing,Weird.....where these two tic marks come from.....? Oh well.
Most Beautiful Thing,I haven't watched a single episode of Doctor Who (intimidated and honestly don't know where to start) but wow this clip blew me away.
Most Beautiful Thing,I caught way more feels than I thought I would.
Most Beautiful Thing,This will always be one of my favourite doctor who episodes. When it zoomed in and Amy was signed on the painting I burst into tears
Most Beautiful Thing,"Yes, that made me feel something. Thanks for sharing! I think I need to start watching."
Most Beautiful Thing,[deleted]
Most Beautiful Thing,"I've always admired this scene, but something that has gone unnoticeable is the excellent cinematography. It's brilliant! "
Most Beautiful Thing,"That episode, to me, had to have some  the best writing and heartfelt acting ever, even though it's more of a feel good episode and not so involved in the story arcs. 
I feel no other Doctor or Companion could of pulled this off. Although the 10th Doctor and Rose are one of my favorites.  But i always felt the 11th Doctor and Amy Pond had amazing chemistry. Von Gough's reaction at the museum just makes the episode..."
Most Beautiful Thing,"As much as I hate Doctor Who, This truly is a great scene"
Most Beautiful Thing,"Bill Nighy, amazing use of a great actor for a minor scenes. His ""distracted'"" monologues are genius!"
Most Beautiful Thing,"This is by far my favourite moment of that series. It was so, so powerful. "
Most Beautiful Thing,Makes me feel like maybe I'll be worth something someday 
Most Beautiful Thing,"Why can't I view the last 7 second of the video? I'm watching the timer count down, and then it just skips the last 7 seconds and goes straight to the end. Weird. "
Most Beautiful Thing,"Honestly have never watched this show, after watching this scene I think I may have to get into it. Very touching scene "
Most Beautiful Thing,"dammit,i cry every single time.Feel akinship with that mad ginger guy drepessions is a bitch"
Most Beautiful Thing,Where is this show watchable in the States?
Most Beautiful Thing,"So does he still go back to his own time and shoot himself anyway...or have they altered the arc of history forever? 

(I don't know anything about Dr. Who so forgive my ignorance.)"
Most Beautiful Thing,"I love how they pulled a 1955 Doc Brown (BTTF 2) move with Bill's last shot.


[""Hang on, was that...? NAHHHH.""](https://youtu.be/3BFdRdYI51M) "
Most Beautiful Thing,Oh yeah... this is definitely one of the more memorable episodes for me.  Made sure to re-watch this one with the gf once I got her into the show a little bit.
Most Beautiful Thing,That's probably in my top 5 fav episodes. Sad and beautiful. 
Most Beautiful Thing,"Either Bill Nighy is a screaming fanboy of Van Gough who begged to be in this episode for free so that he could have this dialogue; or he's one of the greatest actors of our age.

The little mannerisms at processing the question, the catch of emotion in his voice, the earnestness of his reply and the conviction of his delivery really are what turn this scene from a beautiful setting of justification and recognition into an absolute emotional experience. The audience moves from ""yeah, we love you Vincent"" to ""I, personally love you, Vincent"" through Bill's words.

And we all secretly want to be Vincent in just this moment. Having that said about you while you are still alive just doesn't happen to us."
Most Beautiful Thing,Not really
Most Beautiful Thing,Why... why did I subscribe?
Most Beautiful Thing,Too bad it wasn't real and the actual Van Gogh died despising himself and convinced he was a failure.
Most Beautiful Thing,This episode always makes me cry man. 
Most Beautiful Thing,I could never get into Doctor Who as a kid for some reason. I tried as it was aired on PBS back in the early 80s where I lived.  Where would I start watching now? Look for the older stuff or jump into the current incarnation??
Most Beautiful Thing,I'm currently rewatching Doctor Who on Netflix and I saw this episode again at the weekend and I cried like a baby.
Most Beautiful Thing,Bill Nighy would be a great Doctor wouldn't he
Alce and Alice,"She's saying it's ironic because they are pit against each other by men in the show and fans which are majority men are also pitting them against each other. But not sure what comments that is based on. Are fans pitting them against each other because of misogyny, or because it's literally the direction the show is going in?"
Alce and Alice,The preview we've been getting for 2-3 weeks shows Alicent trying to stab Rhaenyra with a dagger. Fans are *clearly* being led to believe they will be at odds with eachother.
Alce and Alice,To what extent can “fans” pit fictional characters against each other in the first place??
Alce and Alice,Aren’t we supposed to?
Alce and Alice,Fans pitting batman and joker against each other is fucking ironic
Alce and Alice,"Almost like they are different teams, maybe one team green one black so ironic"
Alce and Alice,"I think she’s doing a great job on the show, but when I watch her interviews I get the vibe that she neither knows nor cares for the source material very much."
Alce and Alice,"
 It's a civil war and they're >!(going to be) the leaders of the opposing sides.!< Course people are going to pit them against each other that's what the show is about!

She's a good actress but this quote pretty dumb

Edit: Yes I've read the exact quote multiple times and yet still haven't figured out if she was referring to her and Emily Carey or Rhaenyra and Alicent. If the quote is about her and Emily than it's fair comment to make, just worded confusingly"
Alce and Alice,"Honestly getting tired of actors and actresses giving their unwanted takes on fans of franchises and belittling the audiences of the show which is making them money in the first place.

The show itself seems to be implying the two will be at odds specifically because Rhaenyra is a little more immature while Alicent is at least trying to be level headed.

If that’s not where the show is going then well it’s a twist which the actress is spoiling plus expecting the audience to predict that without inside knowledge is pretty rich. 

So far great show with lots of tension and a very balanced portrayal of multiple parties. Though people need to shut this BS down of streamers , actors etc. blindly going ‘stupid fans this that’. 

All for outing and even arresting ones that send death threats and the like but if people just have an opinion on the show, especially as mild as this one, then leave it be."
Alce and Alice,"Is she just making shit up? Because I have not seen one discussion saying Milly Allcock is better than Emily Carry, or viceversa. The only actors people are ""pushing against one another"" whatever that means, is young Rhaenyra and old Rhanyra and even that seems more like a ""we love young Rhaenyra so much how could anyone do better""."
Alce and Alice,"Everyone has their opinions I guess. If you've read the book. This is not news. In fact if you've read the book, this comment comes off as silly. As that is literally what this book is about. Lol they are not friends."
Alce and Alice,It’s like every fucking day I’m seeing an article from an actor in a show with some (for lack of a better word) “woke” statement criticizing fans of the show/movie. It’s so fucking tiring.
Alce and Alice,"I think the show has been pretty clear that both of them are being used as pawns by their fathers playing a larger game. It’s quite sad, their friendship was the first of many casualties in the coming conflict."
Alce and Alice,Maybe she means some gross stuff she read online not just usual stuff.   Maybe people are talking about who's hotter etc. Who knows.
Alce and Alice,Why is there a news article every week about some actor in this show reacting to social media?
Alce and Alice,"TIL picking sides in a civil war is misogynistic

Worthwhile cultural criticism is dead."
Alce and Alice,Why can't fans just watch a fucking show without being attacked by the actors anymore? Let the fans attack eachother for saying stupid shit and have the actors tell a damn story...
Alce and Alice,"""What I found quite hilarious is that the fan base is also putting the actors, the Young Alicent and the Young Rhaenyra, at odds with each other, and choosing who’s better, also by decision of mostly men. So I think that it’s really just fucking ironic""

Does she have a problem with the viewing audience being majority male? And no shit, sherlock, people pit characters against each other all the time. That's the nature of, you know, watching a show about conflict.

I'm going to enjoy the hell out of the general audience perception of Rhaenyra as the plot progresses. The Dany treatment she's getting now will be hilarious in hindsight."
Alce and Alice,They have been against each other though? They’ve been arguing and Rhaenrya was HEAVILY manipulating Alicent with her lies in the most recent episode.
Alce and Alice,"those men, man, always pitting women against each others"
Alce and Alice,"ffs with these people in Hollywood. So pretentious lol. Fans are putting them against each other because that’s literally what the writers are doing. They need viewers to want to pick a side and to create controversy. Ugh, these people smh."
Alce and Alice,Wait till she learns about us having a circle jerk over who'd win in a fight: jaime or khal drogo and other dozen male knights lmao.
Alce and Alice,Here we go more fan baiting
Alce and Alice,I don’t think she knows what irony is
Alce and Alice,"Is she saying pitting the ""actors"" against each other by comparing them, or pitting the characters against each other?  Because those are very different. 

The story is dictating a showdown between the 2.  I'm not seeing how that is misogyny at all. 

That said, if the comments are about deciding which actress is doing better, I can *kind of* see that point.  But people will always compare actors on shows. 

Also, is GoT mostly men watching?  Maybe its just my social circle, but it seems pretty evenly split to me."
Alce and Alice,"Reading this comment thread just makes me weary of this show.

It’s wild how Game of Thrones showed the sexism inherent in a society and didn’t make it feel like a forced song and dance."
Alce and Alice,"**Alcock said :**

> What I found quite hilarious is that the fan base is also putting the actors, the Young Alicent and the Young Rhaenyra, at odds with each other, and choosing who’s better, also by decision of mostly men. So I think that it’s really just fucking ironic."
Alce and Alice,Why is it ironic?
Alce and Alice,I'm not sure why they say ironic but I was really sad when they had their falling out and Rhaenyra shunned Alicent... I know each episode essentially spans large portions of time but I was hoping they'd make amends much faster.
Alce and Alice,Milly needs to stop taking it so personal. This isn’t real life. Chill.
Alce and Alice,"...which in itself is ironic to say, because it's not like the men got each others back in some sisterhood pact either."
Alce and Alice,I seriously don't care.  What I do care about the writing seems a bit off this season so far.  Still Game of Thrones.  But off.
Alce and Alice,The original story is literally called >!The Princess and The Queen!< lol
Alce and Alice,[deleted]
Alce and Alice,Unless she's talking about it being ironic because >!of how the relationship goes in the books!< it's kind of frustrating how actors on these shows don't know their own character's origins
Alce and Alice,"Maybe my humor bone is broken, but I don't see how people comparing actors to each other and also being men is ironic."
Alce and Alice,"They are literally the opposing leaders in a civil war, how are they not put against each other?"
Alce and Alice,Or maybe fans read the book?
Alce and Alice,[deleted]
Alce and Alice,I'm not sure she's read the books
Alce and Alice,"What a shit take, she just wants attention"
Alce and Alice,[deleted]
Alce and Alice,"Women throw a fit when stories are not written for them. The actress admits the fanbase is majority male… maybe they should write stories for a male majority fanbase. Jesus wokeness is getting fucking old. I watched ‘The Descent’ last night and it was a fun movie that had an all female cast. Didn’t have any male bashing in it so it was enjoyable. Maybe the HotD writers could take a note from that movie that you can write female stories that men will want to watch if you don’t make men the punching bag of your story. “Down with the Patriarchy”? In the US, women are going to college at a 50% higher rate than men. Every demographic of women is going to college at a higher rate than white men. If you are a black female, you are more likely to go to college than a white male. Females nowadays are appropriating the trails of 50+ yo women. If you are female and under the age of 40, you have had nothing but positive bias in your life. You had female only scholarships, female only mentorship opportunities, preferred hiring, and preferred promotions. The patriarchy has been dead for 20 years, we now need to kill the matriarchy because young men are suffering because they have fewer opportunities than their female counterparts yet are still hearing about how privileged they are… fuck off, that is why this show is unwatchable."
Alce and Alice,I'm just really enjoying the show so far.
Alce and Alice,Is this one of those pathetic corporate fan baiting attempts
Alce and Alice,Sometimes actors don’t realise who pays them
Alce and Alice,"They’re… supposed to be pitted against each other lol

These 2 should probably stop giving their opinion on the show & just let fame come to them."
Alce and Alice,"Threads like these really go to show that people will just dead ass read the title and post without knowing what it’s talking about “. She’s talking about how the two characters are friends and how that friendship is challenged by the sexist culture they  live in. The irony is that even though this takes place in a fiction patriarchal society, many people in the real world are doing the same thing."
Alce and Alice,I think it's funny she woulda let daemon fuck her if he coulda got his dick hard. Then she was so horney afterwards she fucked the first dude she saw which thankfully was Cole. Episode 4 was 10/10
Alce and Alice,can we enjoy the show please withot shaming each other
Alce and Alice,I wish they hadn’t said the thing about the time jump. “Journalists” spoiling shows for clicks really grinds my gears.
Alce and Alice,"It’s one thing if their characters either never interact or are friends. It’s another if the show *literally* puts them against each other and we as the audience rightfully pick a side we like more. Does she go to footie games and cheer for both teams, or ask why everyone is only cheering on one side?"
Alce and Alice,"I get the impression this actor just wants to be mad at men for some reason so has invented this little story as a way to justify lashing out at the fanbase. It's really puzzling, but it looks like she's pandering to a certain audience for potential future job prospects. Apparently she only has one episode to go before being replaced with an older actor after a leap forward in the timeline."
Alce and Alice,"Even people here aren’t getting it. The entire point of their relationship is that they love each other dearly as friends, but the men in power around them both create situations in which that friendship is strained AND emotionally manipulate the characters into acting on behalf of the men’s power plays. They keep drifting towards each other despite this, but keep getting pulled away by the men in power. Otto Hightower in particular, but also King Viserys and to a more emotional extent Daemon.

Some of you have zero media literacy."
Alce and Alice,I’d rather pit them towards each other if you know what I mean
Alce and Alice,"Because that is the plot of the story. 

It's pointless to become politically enraged over a story whose conclusion has already been determined. It's akin to being upset with the Greeks because they cheated in the Trojan War."
Alce and Alice,"Man, like 80% of you just decided to roll in here without reading anything and show your ass, huh."
Alce and Alice,I hear new sassy comments from the actors about this show every week but I never see a single complaint…do they just assume we will shit all over because is close to GOT?
Alce and Alice,Isnt that part of the show and whats to come according to the book ?
Alce and Alice,It's hard for me to believe anyone gives a shit about this boring ass show
Alce and Alice,"These was a dumb turn of events for me. Since when did the game of thrones world care about some Christian like chastity?

And she’s Targaryen. They are well known to fuck each other."
Alce and Alice,Has she read the book yet..?
Alce and Alice,Alicent really feels one note so far.
Alce and Alice,"It's literally what happens in the story; actually, in the book, I think they weren't friends to begin with."
Alce and Alice,She kissed her uncle!
Alce and Alice,"....That's, that's literally the direction the show is heading. And anybody who has read the book knows this is the direction also...."
Alce and Alice,"I don't understand ...

This is the conflict that underpins the entire Dance of the Dragons ... greens Vs the blacks

The shows gone out of its way to setup this conflict , they had a brief moment of ""reconciliation"" in ep4 just before the coming time skip to make it hurt that much more when they break-break


I don't understand how it's ironic?"
Alce and Alice,"It's not ironic, it's literally the text of the fucking story!  Not subtext, it is actually what happens."
Alce and Alice,Hey I didn’t tell my best friends father an emotionally-bonding story about my dead mother when he was grieving over his wife and childs deaths. And I didnt take that commanding tone “I am the queen” tone with Rhynaera either.
Alce and Alice,I'd watch more Brooke Windham vs. Chutney Windham. With dragons.
Alce and Alice,I mean the show is tailored to pit them against each other… it’s a pretty huge plot line now and even more so in upcoming episodes
Alce and Alice,A little too i-ronic
Alce and Alice,and?
Alce and Alice,"This really has become staple of marketing for a TV program, hasn't it?"
Alce and Alice,"I agree with her. They aren’t meant to be pitted against each other, but they are meant to contrasted with each other, which I thought was ABUNDANTLY clear in episode 4."
Alce and Alice,"God fans of shows are just the worst aren't they. Especially men.

Can I get a yaass queen?"
Alce and Alice,Literally no one cares about that storyline. Its all about Daemon's assault to the throne and what would come out of it
Alce and Alice,"Were they actually scared they wouldn't get a Season 2 when they were writing the first season. Resulting in so many time jumps? ""We gotta put in all this plot in the first season just in case we won't be able to do it in a Season 2. 

Of course you're going to get a Season 2, you are in the GRR Martin universe. You could have at least given Young Rhaenrya a full season."
Alce and Alice,"Im just interested to see what causes Alicent to essentially betray Rhaenyra and declare her own son king.  In the book they aren't of an age and they aren't friends so it makes more sense, but they need to have a big falling out in the show for the plot to make sense and in the last episode they sort of reconciled."
Alce and Alice,"Two friends that are set at opposite ends by their relationship with the king- it's just natural to see that they could have a rivalry, especially if we add in that one is ostensibly to produce a male heir that would threaten the others birthright. To me it has little to do with misogyny- if it were two young men that were friends, one a bastard son of the queen who has been named heir, and the other becomes queens consort and could produce a true born heir, we would expect the same rivalry- esp if the queens consort man had a father who actively plotted to put his family into power."
Alce and Alice,Allicent literally saved Rhaenyra from getting disowned in the last episode. I dont want to know what's to come but as of now she definitely isn't against Rhaenyra.
Alce and Alice,"I’m not sure where the double meaning is in the idea that fans might expect 2 characters to have bad blood on a tv show

But I’m kinda leaning towards the idea that Milly  Alcock doesn’t know what irony is"
Alce and Alice,I'm guessing she didn't read the books.
Alce and Alice,Um… yeah about that part… if you read the book you would know that is EXACTLY what happened and was the cause of the Targaryen civil war.
Alce and Alice,I'm just waiting for them to fuck... Seen it since the first episode.
Alce and Alice,"Not this shit again. This is entertainment. People pick sides. Actors, directors, studios etc upbraiding or frankly sneering at fans with insinuations of various moral failings underscores that their primary focus is increasingly The Message."
Alce and Alice,"jokes on her my gf, who is not a man, is firmly team Blacks and she and her little girl friends(they're vertically challenged) are so obnoxious about it lol."
Alce and Alice,"Who could possibly be team ""I obey my father without question and I have no personality of my own""?"
Alce and Alice,Or maybe she’s saying it’s ironic like rrraaaaaaainnnn on your wedding day
Alce and Alice,"The show is trying to tell a balanced story that shows how a brutally sexist system affects the people born into it, and it’s going to great lengths to explore the layers of these characters and how their conflicts are often born from the unfair nature of the society they live in. 

A lot of fans on the other hand get understandably caught up in picking sides, some of whom start to try and justify their sides’ bad deeds while undercutting the other sides’ good deeds, that sort of thing. Classic rivalry hatred kinda stuff, but that’s all understandable for the way that most people like to watch TV and the kind of story this is. 

I think the actress is annoyed/amused that fans of the story get caught up in picking sides the way the men in the story do rather than picking up on what the show is trying to say about these characters and why they do what they do."
Alce and Alice,I always assumed they had secretly been lovers the whole time
Alce and Alice,"Hard to say. As a woman, I'm rooting for them to have each other's backs. They live in a cynical world, though. It's not unreasonable to expect betrayal."
Alce and Alice,[removed]
Alce and Alice,"I pit them against each other because the show made it seem like she hated her for being married to her father. 

It was seen as the one girl’s dad forcing her daughter to marry the king to get more power, and the other girl hated that her friend was married off to her dad.

Sorry I don’t remember all the names in these shows always. 

I also thought initially that the two girls might have had romantic feelings for each other as well, but maybe I was reading into it too much."
Alce and Alice,Are they pit against eachother by men though? They both seem pretty fine with becoming wife of the king/heir of the king.
Alce and Alice,Why's it have to be men?
Alce and Alice,"Yeah, I don't think it's misogynistic to see that Alicent is going to support her son's claim to the throne while Rhaenyra is going to push her own claim. But I bet there are fans who are doing some sexisms."
Alce and Alice,Alicent went behind her friend's (maybe more?) back to befriend and ultimately seduce her friend's father.   ...and it's the evil male viewer's fault?
Alce and Alice,"Most likely the same crowd that likes to do the same with the women of GoT, the women on Breaking Bad etc. The Female characters are always picked apart and compared to each other to determine who is the “good one”. While the men can be complete monsters, and still be loved because they’re apparently people that many men can identify with on some level.
The women are almost always judged on their moral behavior or who they are to the men around them.

I really enjoy HotD (never writing that sentence again), but it really bugs me how the conflicts between the women are written. I get it, being “catty” and condescending against each other is all the weapons they have. But I’m also tired of seeing this every time someone writes a woman.

Despite this I find the relationship between Alicent and Rhaenyra very interesting and even more sad.
They’re best friends and after Alicent is pretty much forced to do her duty for the family and marry the father of her best friend, she has no one left. She also has to take the roll of “mother” to Rhaenyra, and has absolutely no freedom to act as the teenager she is. Which Rhaenyra actually can.
She basically raped every night, and this will be the rest of her life.
She will likely lose Rhaenyra completely at some point as well. And like Cersei, will have nothing left but her children. Who can just as easily be taken away.

I think I’m actually most looking forward to seeing where the story takes Alicent. Hope it won’t be as bleak as the first couple of episodes.

Edit: and I haven’t read Fire & blood, so don’t spoil please 🙃"

My Husband Wont Fit,"Gregory in both The Walking Dead show and comics. Granted, he's a sleazy politician type of person that you're supposed to hate.

Negan is probably the most obvious character, but, in the comics, he's at least endearing because of how absurd his personality is and how ridiculous his justifications are - almost like The Joker, really. In the show, I like his portrayal by Jeffrey Dean Morgan, but I think the writers/showrunners screwed up his character arc.

They went a little too far in making Negan overbearingly evil in Season 7 (he kills >!Glenn and Spencer!< in the same way as the comics, but Comic Negan still has an, albeit messed up, sense of morality whereas Show Negan is harsh for the sake of being harsh), got him mostly right in Season 8, and then dialed him way too far back into being a reformed good guy starting with Season 9 as if the writers realized ""oh crap! He's supposed to have a redemption arc!"" and overcorrected his character. Comic Negan has a redemption arc too, but he never becomes ""good.""

Instead, in the comics (massive comic spoilers), >!it's just that Negan makes a deal with Alexandria that if he helps fight The Whisperers then they'll exile him instead of keeping him prisoner. Both sides honor the deal, Negan confesses that Rick's ways of doing things were better than his (something that never happens in the show because Show Negan always makes excuses for himself), and Negan goes into exile and leaves the story (Negan is completely out of the picture by the time The Commonwealth arc happens and only makes a brief appearance in the final timeskip issue with no dialogue). He spends the rest of his life mourning over Lucille and is alone with the guilt of his actions weighing over him, and he's eventually forgotten many years later by everyone except Carl while the rest of the world is rebuilding civilization without him.!<"

My Husband Wont Fit,"Scotty Valens from Cold Case. 

He's a smug prick who is always doing unethical stuff in the name of ""justice"" but never faces any major consequences for it. There's one episode where he gets suspended for 30 days, but it doesn't affect him at all because his boss serves the suspension to protect his record. 

He also gets caught up in a ton of personal drama, especially in the later seasons. Other characters have personal drama too, but Scotty's drama seems to drag on for ages which eats up time that the show could spend focusing on the actual murder investigations."

My Husband Wont Fit,"So good to see people are actually understanding the show as the way it was meant to be watched.

It’s laughable to see people say that Buffy season 5 is a good FINAL season. You can actually see all the terrible decisions Willow and Xander are going to make in the next season, unless you are completely blind.

Why that is? Because they were written that way. Because season 5 was NOT written as a final season and characters enter arcs that are unfinished until season 6 or 7.

But yeah, I agree with the annoyance Xander brings to me. Not so much with Willow because they actually dare to touch how selfish she is and that is entertaining. Xanders problems are never fully addressed."

My Husband Wont Fit,"Abby on ER. I don’t understand why so many fans gush over her and talk about how amazing she is. She’s selfish and treats almost everyone around her like crap, and I don’t think she deserved the happy ending she got in the last season. She was fine as Carol’s OB nurse and when she was first introduced as a medical student but then they made her completely miserable and bratty. I also felt like she was elevated above the rest of the cast and seen as more special and attractive than the other characters, especially in the later years. It felt like ER wasn’t an ensemble drama anymore; it was basically all about Abby all the time.

I just don’t understand all the praise she gets because she’s “flawed” and the insistence that she be liked and felt sorry for. Everyone has flaws, but Abby’s flaws hurt others more often than not, and no I don’t find it interesting to watch. It’s super draining and about ruined the show. Plus sometimes in real life…you just don’t like some people you meet and I think that’s OK. That’s how I feel about her. She just rubs me the wrong way overall and I don’t care how “complex” and “interesting” she is."
My Husband Wont Fit,I couldn't stand Janice or Lidia Soprano. All they did was whine and drive Tony mad. No wonder he had to see a shrink.
My Husband Wont Fit,"Yeah, Buffy. I really don't like Buffy, the character. Buffy, the show, is one of my favourite shows. But I think that makes it special. You relate to the other characters, these characters love the main character, and that's why it works. I'm convinced that's by design. Many other shows use this device, the lead is unlikeable but the side characters make the viewer care, and it's effective.

It's a bit like life. Your friends aren't always particular nice people, not even particular interesting. But they're your friends and you love them."

My Husband Wont Fit,"If I hate a character it usually has less to do with any kind of ""I would hate this person if I knew them"" thing and more to do with poor writing.

I really didn't like Mandy Hampton on the first season The West Wing. She started off as too inherently tied to Josh's character, and when Sorkin quickly decided to move her away from her ties to Josh, there wasn't enough of a character there to exist independently, and the effort was never put into making her a complete person with full characterization. And the role she played among the staff was ultimately just redundant and pointless, so when she was moved away from being tied to Josh and being his potential love interest, there really wasn't any need for her to be there. So much of her character could have been fixed if Sorkin had just given her a different job/area of expertise right at the beginning.

There's so much wrong with the writing of Annie Blackburn in season 2 of Twin Peaks. Both she and John Justice Wheeler were obviously brought in as love interest replacements after the decision (demand) was made to move away from Cooper/Audrey, and while JJW is pretty bad in how absolutely nothing he is, Annie is just a mess of ""why did they think this would be *better?*"" to the point where it almost felt intentional on the part of the writers. Like ""oh, you don't think Coop would be romantically interested in an 18 year old? Well let's make a character who acts like a child and hire an actress even younger than the one that plays Audrey to play her and make her your love interest! And lets make her extremely emotionally and mentally vulnerable and make that relationship move disturbingly fast at a time when Cooper is being confronted with the romantic mistakes and traumas of his past, but then not address any of the issues or parallels with any of this at all!"" At best, she's written as an obvious quickie replacement for a story that was probably meant for a different character without the necessary changes made to what happened in the story and how it was paced in order for it to make sense. 

I always struggled with the writing of Kate on Lost. She was a sort of ""one step forward and two steps back"" character in terms of development, which got really frustrating really fast."
My Husband Wont Fit,Madmen.  Betty.  I really didn't like the actress or the character.

Green Door,"Ooooooooorgy

Gotta love that ten minute psychedelic cumshot scene. "
Green Door,"It was a really well done finale. I never quite fell in love with the show the way others have, but I always appreciated its humor and writing. The finale was a great way to dive deeper into some of the more intangible and powerful questions of the afterlife, and they handled it all well in a way that was not preachy or overly philosophical. 

My only real beef with the finale is how they wrapped up Eleanor. Most of her pivotal moments in the final episode was about having her help close the arcs of other characters, then she kind of just wandered off into oblivion. There’s of course something to be said about a character who began as super selfish becoming more concerned about her friends than herself, but I just would have liked to see that connection drawn a little more effectively to really give closure to her journey."
Green Door,"In a way, it had two great finales, because if the prior episode had been the last, that too would have outshone the vast majority of series’ ends. 

After the next-to-last episode ended, and because it too would have made a great series ending, we were afraid they would screw up the actual finale. Yet they somehow pulled off something truly spectacular."
Green Door,"*The wave returns to the ocean, where it came from and where it's supposed to be.*"
Green Door,"Janet deserved such a better ending.

Chidi's was sad but understandabe

Jason had a very Jason ending.

Michael had the best fate. How excited he gets over his Costco-esque membership card is so wholesome.

I also especially liked what happened with Tahani.

As for Eleanor, she completed her character. She did a complete 180 throughout the series, did a lot of introspection, changed a lot and not just to serve her own self interests, and it was satisfying to say the least."
Green Door,"I know I'm in the minority,  but I was slightly let down by the finale, cant quite put my finger on it; but I kinda wanted a more conclusive ending g than: ""we're in heaven, and now if you want you can DIE DIE"".

I was also really bummed when instead of a 90 mins finale, it was 60mins with 30 mins of the cast talking. Also they're ""guest star to end all guest stars"" was a huge let down too, really nick offerman for 10 secs that's it??

Overall I enjoyed the show quite a bit, but I think season one was the best

Edit: I was overall pretty disappointed when our crew got to the good place, like it was the most important part of the whole show, and they barely flesh it out; wish we could've seen more famous people"
Green Door,One of the greatest endings ever. I lost it when Spiegel im Spiegel (the song featured in About Time) started playing.
Green Door,"I wasn't ready for such a philosophical closure. 

I thought it was gonna be some jokes and sad moments, but oh no, they went all out with a complete closure. 

From go karting with monkeys to existential crisis from all achievable happiness in one episode was a wild ride."

Green Door,"It annoys me how obsessed everyone continues to be with when they were alive. When Chidi’s friend is like “oh man, Chidi, making a decision?” it’s super strange. You knew him as the “can’t make decisions” guy for maybe 35 years. You knew him as the “can make decisions” guy for thousands, possibly millions of years.  How are you still so hung up on that first 35?"
Green Door,"I didn't love the suicide forest ending, but I thought the rest of the series was really good."
Green Door,Didn’t care for the ending. And they were all a little too self righteous too.
Green Door,Always felt michael had the best character development on the show.  Started off as  a demon who reveled in the torture of humans.  Then he starts enjoying their company and develops hope for them.  In the end he even becomes one himself.
Green Door,"I read someone point out that Eleanor walking through the door was a deal she made with the Judge for Michael to be human. She didn't have the same type of internal feeling Jason and Chidi did yet, but she sacrificed herself for Michael thus completing the journey from selfish to selfless."
Green Door,"> My only real beef with the finale is how they wrapped up Eleanor. Most of her pivotal moments in the final episode was about having her help close the arcs of other characters, then she kind of just wandered off into oblivion. There’s of course something to be said about a character who began as super selfish becoming more concerned about her friends than herself, but I just would have liked to see that connection drawn a little more effectively to really give closure to her journey.

Yeah, that was my thought too. I think even just a slightly extended sit down on the bench before walking through in which she reflected a bit more on her journey would have tied it up nicely for me. Her wrap up felt a little rushed while everyone else felt about right."
Green Door,">There’s of course something to be said about a character who began as super selfish becoming more concerned about her friends than herself, but I just would have liked to see that connection drawn a little more effectively to really give closure to her journey.

It's not just about learning to love, but also to a degree about learning to let herself be loved. The show draws the connection very explicitly between her selfishness, and the fact she had pretty much no emotional bond with her parents from a very young age.

In that sense, I think it was very meaningful that her last challenge was to bring the person most like her old self into the Good Place: Mindy St. Claire."
Green Door,"I like thinking of the penultimate episode as the finale and the last episode as a coda or epilogue that finishes off the story, as both episodes work well as endings to the story."
Green Door,"> I know I'm in the minority, but I was slightly let down by the finale, cant quite put my finger on it; but I kinda wanted a more conclusive ending g than: ""we're in heaven, and now if you want you can DIE DIE"".

That's the conclusion. Eternal bliss isn't actually blissful; we need to be going somewhere. The door is the end of a million other seasons of joys."
Green Door,"> I was also really bummed when instead of a 90 mins finale, it was 60mins with 30 mins of the cast talking.

On the podcast, Mike Schur explains that the original full finale was longer but since shows are written in 30 or 60 minute blocks with 10-20 minutes of commercials, the entire episode ended with 20 minutes left, so without adding more that they didn't want to add (stuff they did not feel worked) or cutting stuff they didn't want to cut, they asked Seth Meyers to do the little thing he did with the cast."
Green Door,">a more conclusive ending g than: ""we're in heaven, and now if you want you can DIE DIE"".

I agree. I was with them on the issue that infinite perfection would get boring. But, having the solution to that be that you can ""DIE DIE"" (as you put it) seems a bit half-assed. I'd think any true version of a Good Place would have to offer perfection in a way you simply wouldn't get bored of. Of course, if philosophers couldn't crack what that would look like in the last few thousand years, it'd be a bit of a high task for Michael Schur to figure it out for a TV show."
Green Door,I still think the cameo they were talking about was Lisa Kudrow. Jameela never said the cameo was in the finale. That's just what was speculated.
Green Door,"> I was also really bummed when instead of a 90 mins finale, it was 60mins with 30 mins of the cast talking. Also they're ""guest star to end all guest stars"" was a huge let down too, really nick offerman for 10 secs that's it??

Wasn't the cameo Mary Steenburger?"
Green Door,The point was that you didn't see famous people because the people we idolize are not all that. Hence why they chose Hypatia of Alexandria instead of a more well known philosopher.
Green Door,"I mean, not the traditional bad place with penis flatteners and butthole spiders. But some people just don't get better, like Brent was seen towards the end, after however many thousands of Bearimies, and he just didn't get being a good person at all."
Green Door,"""Unmaking A Murderer"""
Green Door,"They did say that people did end up at the Bad Place. It was part of the pitch - yeah, people still went there, but “at least they had a fair shot” (is my paraphrase) to not go there. We never saw Brent actually enter - he was still struggling many bearimys later, and he’s obviously not as bad as Ted Bundy."
Green Door,They said anyone with a negative score automatically went to the bad place.
Green Door,"Well, the test is basically the new bad place, as it's where you end up if you don't have enough points. It's just no longer eternal."
Green Door,"Reaching nirvana, which the door represents, means becoming one with the universe and transcending the very idea of suicide or that there is a self you can destroy.

You are not the wave, but the ocean itself."
Green Door,Self righteous how?
Green Door,"Agreed, especially since he was always, from the very beginning, deeply fascinated by them. Bringing back his collection of human things in the finale was a great way to come full circle on him."
Green Door,"Is there absolutely any hint of that being the case on the show, itself? I didn't get that impression."
Green Door,"I chalked it up to her character. She's always been the one making decisions, saying and doing things without thinking, ect. She had a breakdown to beg Chidi to say, and just an hour or so later flipped and changed her mind. Her issue throughout the series was that she was selfish and always rushed to do things that would benefit herself. It was very in character for her to rush her initial door walk, then stop and realize she wasn't ready. And her immediately rushing out once she made the deal for Michael was a very Eleanor move."
Green Door,"Hmm good point, similar to how the matrix couldn't just be ""nirvana """
Green Door,re-incarnation
Green Door,"I think it was Offerman, myself. He's in the finale, and his scene is with her. I think it was a much bigger deal for her to do a scene with him than any of us perceived it to be, on screen. She's a relative newcomer, after all."
Green Door,"The lady from ""Friends ""?"
Green Door,Is that the point they were making?
Green Door,"That kind of made me not sad exactly, but him finding out he was in the bad place and had been a horrible person the whole time seemed to actually be a way to help improve him."
Green Door,"Is this correct? I believe that they stated that the bad place becomes the trials, and that the trials last as long as they need to for someone to qualify for the Good Place. So everyone can get in eventually or stay in the trials forever. The closest thing to hell, is an eternity of trials, which is very much like hell. I don't think there was a traditional bad place anymore, though."
Green Door,"All their attitudes at the end were annoying, and just look up self righteous, they were all acting like they were better than everyone and felt very fake."
Green Door,"She goes to the Judge and says ""if you do this, you'll never have to hear from any of us ever again"". So this implies part of the deal is Eleanor walking through the door. She tried to walk through earlier, but hesitated and realized she wasn't ready. She had talked herself into thinking she's ready, but it wasn't the same knowingness as Chidi"
Green Door,">Is there absolutely any hint of that being the case on the show, itself? I didn't get that impression.

Yes, it's in-your-face obvious. The viewer is allowed to eavesdrop on a conversation where Eleanor asks the judge for something, but the viewer does not know what. From the timing though, it's obvious she's asking for Michael."
Green Door,I would have loved to see her end up in charge of everything at the end.
Green Door,"Here's a link to an Instagram post she made about how excited she was to work with Lisa. She did not make one about Nick Offerman, even though I'm sure that was lovely for her too.

https://www.instagram.com/p/B7wgvodF5Mu/?igshid=17pzzmg3abrjj"
Green Door,"The finale aspect is irrelevant, as no one ever said the big cameo was in the finale. I would be blown away to meet Nick Offerman, and I expect Jameela was pleased too. But that doesn't make Lisa Kudrow a smaller star. And she was also in a scene with Lisa Kudrow. 

I don't think Jameela is so fresh-faced that a short scene with a well-known actor blows her mind. She has been in tv for years. I think that whichever of the two she was talking about was someone she is a big fan of. Which could be either. But I think they were trying to promote the cameo, and it makes a lot more sense that they'd be doing that for Lisa than Ron."
Green Door,"Yeah, the lady from Friends. Jameela said the cameo was someone from ""the NBC family"". Friends was one of the biggest shows in the history of the NBC."
Green Door,"I think there's hope for Brent. When he found out he wasn't in The Good Place at the end of the original trial, he connected the dots and realized how he had been wrong.

Getting that lesson to stick through reboots may take a great deal of time, but he at least demonstrated that he's capable of learning it."
Green Door,They were heroes because they saved everyone from being tortured for all eternity.
Green Door,*Someone’s* not getting out of the bad place...
Green Door,"You should listen to the official podcast. There's no such deal. Mike Schur talks very specifically about how Eleanor finished her journey by helping Mindy and Michael. She was absolutely contented to go through on her own, not out of any agreement.

He even talks about using the same tracking shot on her that they used on Jason, to help signify that she felt the same contentment feeling that he had."
Green Door,"While she does say that, I disagree with your categorization of the implication. The true implication of that line specifically is that by giving Michael humanity, he won't be mulling around the afterlife forever. In Eleanor's subsequent conversation with Michael, the scene ends with a zoom into Eleanor's smiling face. The implication of that is that she feels the same sense of satisfaction that Chidi and Jason did."
Green Door,"Yeah no man she couldn't reach closure without helping Michael reach his closure.  Michael and mindy were unturned stones for her.  She wasn't at peace yet. 

Then she helped them.  Then she reached peace.  Then she walked through the door.  

So I guess in a way I see what you're saying because it is telling the judge that she will walk through the door, play that isn't part of the deal that's just a byproduct of it the judge isn't doing its Eleanor leaves her alone and goes through the door she just can go to the door because she's done helping people she cares about."
Green Door,Ehhhh thats a pretty big stretch. I think she just realized that she was done and there was nothing else for her to do. Shes like...50000 at that point right? Fuck else she got to do
Green Door,"Calm down. I get that she asked the Judge to make Michael human.

What I didn't get the impression of was that *because* of that request, she was forced to walk through the door **before she was personally ready** as some sort of payment on a deal."
Green Door,They also had a joke earlier on about how Phoebe would be the only one of the Friends to possibly get into the Good Place.
Green Door,"Offerman was also part of the NBC family, and they had a number of references to Ron Swanson and Offerman himself during the run of the show."
Green Door,Everyone should listen to that podcast because it's awesome
Green Door,Ah understood.
Green Door,"Yes, he's also from the NBC family, and more importantly from Schur World. But they also dropped Phoebe references before Lisa's cameo. And it was a much larger cameo. Which is why I think Jameela was talking about her."
Green Door,Agreed!
Green Door,"Wasn't a cameo at all. It was just a regular guest role.

Offerman being in it for 30 seconds playing himself? Cameo.

Lisa Kudrow playing a major part for an episode. Not a cameo."
Green Door,"Whether it is the correct term or not, I have seen a number of articles that refer to Lisa Kudrow's cameo."
Green Door,"We got a long way to go and a whole goddamn season of television to get there, we’re gonna do what we all know can already get done!"
Green Door,"All this show should be is people going to the diner, ordering Diablo sandwiches and Dr. Peppers."
Green Door,"As a kid that grew up watching SATB, i'll be watching."
Green Door,How has this not blown up?  I'm a huge Danny McBride fan and the thought of him playing The Bandit is already making me smile.
Green Door,"This could be good, but am I the only one that remembers the Bandit tv movies from the '90s, starring Brian Bloom? They were in the same syndication block that gave us the Sorbo Hercules movies."
Green Door,And make it quick!
Green Door,I have them on dvd and man are they not really good
Green Door,">In what appears to be a prequel to the Smokey and the Bandit films, a young Bandit returns to his hometown

Four of them, released in 1994. I picked a good year to not watch TV."
Green Door,I was kinda interested in that Person of Interest back door pilot where they had previous numbers team up to solve cases in DC.
Green Door,Brady Bunch once had a backdoor pilot for a diverse Brady Bunch called Kelly's Kids
Green Door,"Whatever happened to the show about the girl in the motel from Fresh off the Boat, Magic Motor Inn? Is that still happening?"
Green Door,"As a longtime Star Trek fan, I'm still waiting for a Gary Seven show"
Green Door,"Darkwing Duck from the new Ducktales. I am only saying this one since it's rumored that new Darkwing Duck show will a completely new one, and I really hope that is wrong."
Green Door,"Green Arrow and the Canaries from ""Arrow""

Not sure if this one technically counts but Marvel's Most Wanted from ""Agents of Shield""."
Green Door,"Wayward Sisters could have fun, but I dislike Claire Novak, which seemed to be the protagonist of that. I love Jody, I adore Donna, I am okay with Alex, but I didn't like Claire."
Green Door,"The Paternoster Gang (Madame Vastra, Jenny Flint, and Strax) from Dr Who. They got a few novellas and appeared in multiple episodes, but I guess the world just wasn't ready for Interspecies Lesbians and their potato butler fighting extraterrestrial crime in Victorian London."
Green Door,That time traveling guy and his cat lady from Star Trek: TOS
Green Door,"Windward Circle, the Gilmore Girls spin-off about Jess. I don’t know if it would’ve worked as a series, but I was always curious what could’ve been."
Green Door,"There was an episode of Fairly Odd Parents where Timmy just watched a full episode of Crash Nebula on TV that was very obviously supposed to be a back door pilot. It came out in 2004 and there’s a very real possibility that if it had been picked up, Danny Phantom, which premiered around the same time that the pilot was made, wouldn’t have been made due to Hartman choosing to work on it instead."
Green Door,"""The Farm"" show from ""The Office"" if only to see how weird it would have been.

""Daredevil"" from the ""Trial of the Incredible Hulk"""
Green Door,"Wayward Sisters.
They could have gotten back to the actual hunting of monsters.
But I honestly don't know of any shows with backdoor pilots picked up"
Green Door,"It got picked up for a 13 episode season but ended on a massive cliffhanger and cancelled. But, the Bones spin-off The Finder was one of my favorite shows. Season 6 episode 19 of Bones."
Green Door,"Unpopular opinion but yeah *Wayward Sisters* definitely had potential. It wasn't perfect and needed refining, but the core concept works and sounds better than 80% of the shows the CW kept greenlighting."
Green Door,Id like that The 100 spinoff to happen
Green Door,"*Warehouse 13* s3e5: ""3...2...1..."", which was clearly mean to be the backdoor pilot of a [Warehouse 12 spinoff](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/syfy-prepping-warehouse-13-spinoff-188019) around H.G. Wells (played by Jaime Murray)."
Green Door,Green Arrow and The Canaries
Green Door,Green Arrow & The Canaries
Green Door,"Not really back door pilots, just some I liked:

“pretty handsome” was an interesting show about a wealthy suburban couple with Joe Feines and Carry Ann Moss.  The twist was Joe was a cross dresser in secret.  It had potential to be a smart show. 

Another one by Peter Berg called Virtuality had Jamie Lannister in the lead and Jimmi Simpson (IASIP and Westworld) as a AI that seemed to be about to go rogue.  They were on a spaceship mission - I forget the details, but it felt a lot like the first act of Sunshine.  I was bummed this didn’t become a series because it had a chance to be good scifi. 

Another pilot that came and went was basically a reboot of sliders called Parallels. A bunch of alternate earths, some post apocalyptic and others with small changes.

In terms of back door pilots, shows like Facts of Life, the Jeffersons, All in the family, different strokes, etc all basically made these, with some of them based on being a back door pilot. It would get shameless when the season opening of a show was about some completely different characters who happen to have a five minute appearance on the show. It would be like “hey, meet the guy who works in the office next door.  Now we will follow him and his wife for a half hour”."
Green Door,I don’t think that was meant to be a backdoor pilot. I wish it was as I’d watch more POI in a heartbeat but that episode fit pretty well into the season and felt more like a nice payoff for long term fans in-between tear jerker episodes than a pilot.
If I Hadnt Met You,"I just looked it up on IMDb and it sounds really similar to Awake (2012) a tv show about a guy who loses his family in a car accident and travels through parallel universes.,"
If I Hadnt Met You,I now know about it. And I'll be watching it. Hadn't heard about it before.
If I Hadnt Met You,"I am late to the discussion but just finished the series last night. I guess I'm the only dumb one because I didn't realize Elisa was Dr. Everest until the last episode when she changed her name, though now I can see there were plenty of hints dropped. 

It took me a while to get used to the English dubbing. I also had the subtitles on and apparently it was two different people doing the translating because the lines were usually totally different. The person doing the dubbing also made a mistake when they had Elisa say she had just had an abortion when it was obviously a miscarriage (subtitles said miscarriage).

I had a couple of observations that were either me not paying close enough attention or holes in the plot. One, did I misunderstand that Elisa cheated on Edward that one time with the skeevy music teacher and that Carla was not his biological child? Edward made a speech about raising the baby as his own, etc, as if he knew it wasn't his. Yet in the final scenario where Elisa studied science and would not have even met the teacher, both Carla and Jan were there. I don't even see how they would have had the exact same children with the new timeline anyway. 

Also, the series was doomed to have a sad ending from the start because the original universe Edward was only visiting these new possible lives. There were two of him and while this made for some interesting and funny scenes, the first Edward could never just join the new universe unless he killed the other Edward. He would always have to go back to that place of intense grief unless he killed himself, but that wouldn't have been a happy ending either."
If I Hadnt Met You,"I finished it and loved it. It was a below average sci-fi but i just loved Eduard and Elisa’s love for each other. Eduard’s character evolution after every universe he visited. And dr. Everest part was too obvious but it gave a nice ending i think, she started this paradox.
And i think the ending was Eduard understanding other Elisa’s is not his one and he can’t love them like his."
If I Hadnt Met You,"I was thinking of making a reddit for it, I hope it gets a season 2, I don't think the sci fi side was explored enough to be honest in it so it has a lot of room for potential in that respect. I mean he had kids. There is the mystery why people only died in car crashes mostly. etc..."
If I Hadnt Met You,"The show has some nice moments and implications, but overall was incredibly disappointing especially with that ending reveal that was obvious from episode one.  It's also overly melodramatic and corny.  I was hoping for a more clever ending,  but it just gave me nothing.  OA is much better."
If I Hadnt Met You,"I binged it last night. I was crying so much. There was so much pain there. and love. oh man..
even it was not the most credible part of the time..."
If I Hadnt Met You,"Very late to this discussion, but ah that show left me with so many feelings. I do think they left a lot of loose ends, especially about why Eduard or his family keep getting in road accidents in all the universes, do they ever explain that?"
If I Hadnt Met You,How’s the dubbing on this series?
If I Hadnt Met You,"I tried getting into this show. I like the premise and all, but SO MUCH time is spent on the main character interacting with his friend/ his mom, etc. it just goes on and on. I wish the pacing was better - does it improve as the show goes on? I only made it part way through the 2nd ep..."
If I Hadnt Met You,"I’m late to this discussion but I just binged watched it in a day. I’ve never had TV emotionally impact me the way this series did. I cried so much through it. It was very thought provoking... thinking of my parents’ death, my ex, damaging choices I’ve made, loss, eternal love... so many emotions. I feel so gutted.

Based on someone’s post here, I’m looking forward to seeing Awake. Other movies that If I Hadn’t Met You reminded me of if you’re interested: Somewhere in Time with Christoper Reeve, Sliding Doors with Gwyneth Paltrow, and the obvious one The Notebook."
If I Hadnt Met You,"I just finished the show last night and found parts of it to be so beautiful and emotional. I too thought of my own personal losses throughout the series. But can someone please explain the ending to me?! I feel so stupid right now! If Dr. Everest is Elisa, is Eduard really the one who died in a car crash? What is real? I’m so confused!"
If I Hadnt Met You,Series 2 of this?
If I Hadnt Met You,I could sense a lot thought  in there.. more than scifi was meant to be more philosophical
If I Hadnt Met You,"I couldn’t find many discussions on this series online and after reading all comments here I’d like to add my thoughts.

In a time-related piece like this whenever the ending feels with too many unanswered questions there is a trick I do that may reveal whether it’s me or the scenario: rewatch the first episode. Writers usually add a lot of stuff to the pilot to intrigue viewers, if it’s too much, then explaining everything may be very complicated/contradicting till the end.

The main questions that stuck with me:

- why didn’t the elder Elisa remember/pretend not to remember Elisa was his wife, claiming her memory failed her

- the lab seems too elaborate to be setup in a few days why is there a scene of her “jumping” to the bridge location in front of his car the night before? I don’t think it’s another Elisa it was made clear this is parallel universes not time travel.


In later episodes more questions:

- why did she get ill when he was away, get better when he got back. Why was she frustrated with him the first time she realized this.

- who is the first user of the device, why did she use male friend, good friend to describe him? Was it just her? 

- Is there really room for season 2;

Unfortunately answering these questions leads to contradictions. It seems to me they had to improvise in a few cases in order to make it fit, perhaps too late to go back and fix scenes that made no sense in the final scenario. This is common in filmmaking and I’ve learned to accept it rather than some elaborate crowdsourced theory. Proof of this lies in the poor, rushed cuts in quite a few cases (red pill? Really?)


At the end the series was good because the message was good, the philosophical questions, chemistry between the cast and the good feeling you get. The pace was too slow I had to fast forward some obvious discussions.


Btw to answer some questions below:
In the beginning a couple of pauses reveal the person involved in the near-accident in the rain was elder Elisa.

The cut in his hand was made by attempting suicide earlier not by using the device in some other universe.

He comes back every time. She is the one that stayed forever and lost him and the kids in her universe."
If I Hadnt Met You,Awake was sooooooo good. 
If I Hadnt Met You,"I've seen Awake. It isn't really the same because in Awake, it's just the two universes plus he solves crimes. This show he explores multiple universes and it's completely serialised. "
If I Hadnt Met You,It's so good! I need more. Enjoy! And then come back here to discuss:)
If I Hadnt Met You,"Just my opinion and personal preference but I find it better not to use English Audio with non-English shows or movies. I just use the subtitles with original audio, that way the performance of the actors/actresses is whole as you are *seeing* and *hearing* the full performance.. in contrast with dubbing you are only *seeing* their performance with some dubbed over voice that never feels quite right. Luckily Netflix subtitles generally seem to be quite accurate also."
If I Hadnt Met You,No the subtitles are what they are actually saying and the audio is English language that matches the lips but still makes sense. That's how a lot of foreign videos are.
If I Hadnt Met You,"There was the universe where his wife became a singer, he could've lived that one out. I don't know why he decided to skip back."
If I Hadnt Met You,[deleted]
If I Hadnt Met You,"Please create one!

Yes, there's so much more to explore. "
If I Hadnt Met You,They only  got into  one road accident all the others are just Eduard reliving the accident  trying  to stop the the accident from happening
If I Hadnt Met You,It took me at least half an episode to realise it was dubbed and not just poor sound mixing. 
If I Hadnt Met You,I watched the whole thing dubbed. I thought it was pretty good. 
If I Hadnt Met You,"Yes, it improves a lot, especially once he really gets into the universe jumping.
A lot of time is spent interacting with them because these characters and his relationships with them are important throughout the show."
If I Hadnt Met You,"It really picks up in the last half of the series but I agree the start is pretty drawn out. I think it could have been cut down by a third and the show would be more focused.

It does make me wish I was back in Barcelona though as they filmed some of it inside the Palau de la Música Catalana where I took a tour."
If I Hadnt Met You,"I felt the same, you just wrote what I've been through when I watched it"
If I Hadnt Met You,"It also reminded me of The Time Traveler’s Wife (the book, at least; I couldn’t sit through the entire movie) and “Hang the DJ” of Black Mirror. Oh, and The Butterfly Effect. Now I’m wondering if all those butterfly references were a nod to the movie."
If I Hadnt Met You,Awake is no way close to it
If I Hadnt Met You,"The ending to me signified that like her husband, alternate Elisa tried for years to find a world where her husband was alive in the end. So to me, the ending was bittersweet, there's a parallel world where his wife doesn't die but it will probably take him all his life to find it.

Anyone know if the show is coming back or if this was it? And I'm glad I figured out they were speaking Catalan as I know my Spanish isn't that rusty."
If I Hadnt Met You,She's Elisa from a universe where she was able to pursue her scientist dreams but in that universe Eduard and the kids died.
If I Hadnt Met You,Do you remember if it had a conclusion? I see it is only one season and might try it because I remember starting it and liking it
If I Hadnt Met You,Honestly hope they keep it at one season. Thought it ended nice 
If I Hadnt Met You,"Yes for some reason Netflix does an especially poor job in terms of matching voices to dubbing. Babylon Berlin especially sounded like two bored Californian reading a book.  One really needs the intonations. As for Netflix subtitles being right, I speak intermediate Spanish and notice sometimes they don't capture the true meaning of the sentence. Was watching El Ministerio del Tiempo and they translated a word that meant baby girl to boy?! lol"
If I Hadnt Met You,"Just finished watching the series. Enjoyed it, very much, but wondered the same thing!!!"
If I Hadnt Met You,"Or would a Discord server be better?

Because other similar shows so do one on alternative universes fiction:

Remake of sliders
The building 
The oa
Fringe
This show 
Tons of other shows on paralelo universes."
If I Hadnt Met You,"Good to know, thanks. I’ll try to pick up where I left off. "
If I Hadnt Met You,Russian doll is awesome too
If I Hadnt Met You,Hold on so she has been secretly watching Eduard and his family even before his wife and children had the crash ? She stayed in this alternate universe because it is the only where her husband doesn’t die?
If I Hadnt Met You,"I’m rewatching it. Can you explain in episode 1 where Eduard hits old Elisa with his car, she disappears... what universe is this? What’s the meaning of it?"
If I Hadnt Met You,I don’t remember 😞
If I Hadnt Met You,"You're right, it did. I was blown away by the reveal. I sensed something between them and thought it was odd but never would've guessed! "
If I Hadnt Met You,Whichever is easier. I don't really use Discord.
If I Hadnt Met You,"I'm guessing that is the case.  Yes, it's creepy but Eduardo is doing the same. If this was a Hollywood show, the two would find a universe where they both live but they seem like star-crossed lovers where either her or him are successful but unhappy in the marriage."
If I Hadnt Met You,"Same! Also, why was Dr Everest's health deteriorating? And why was she contemplating jumping off the bridge?"
If I Hadnt Met You,"I suspect that it's ANOTHER Elisa - not Dr Everest, but another one from another universe doing the same thing."
If I Hadnt Met You,"No worries, I have a never ending shit ton of tv to watch anyways"
If I Hadnt Met You,"Oh I figured it out almost instantly but even though I knew, the payoff was still good "
If I Hadnt Met You,It was a good story. I had my suspicions almost from the start
If I Hadnt Met You,No idea.
If I Hadnt Met You,Unhappy you mean he was unhappy with his wife in the marriage before the car crash ? In dr Everest version she seemed perfectly happy before her crash they looked happy together. How has eduardo been doing the same ? You mean when he tried visiting alternate universes ? Also you remember that dr Everest mentioned tht someone else tried this experiment for her and never returned I wonder who that is ? And what are people here saying things like Eduardo never returned to his universe I was confused. Also in the ending it felt like they were going to live together ? The old Everest and  40 yr old Eduardo!
If I Hadnt Met You,"Perhaps because it's not her home universe? In 'The Man in the High Castle', Trudy feels rough when she's not in her home universe."
If I Hadnt Met You,"I think you’re right. In the same way when Eduardo first went to put the time bracelet on, she noticed the scar was already there. She was so perplexed. So even the main story that we’re witnessing is another parallel life.

I only noticed that (scar) when I rewatched it.

It’s interesting to see it first with English dub and the second time in Catalan with subtitles. Such a beautify language! First time hearing it."
If I Hadnt Met You,Please explain this in detail would be delighted to know your thoughts
If I Hadnt Met You,It did have a conclusion :)
If I Hadnt Met You,"I really hated how he fucked up all the other universes though. And once he's back to his he doesn't care. Season 2 could potentially deal with that. Unless they went the anthology route. 

"
If I Hadnt Met You,Reddit it is?
If I Hadnt Met You,"I think they left the ending open-ended if they wanted to make a Series 2-haven't heard any updates. I think the ending meant that this universe Eduardo finally understood why alt universe wife did what she did in terms of leaving him sometimes and not letting him be close to her. They now share the same feelings of missing their spouses even though this version isn't what the other was looking for. Time travel is complicated. 

To me, in every universe where his wife was successful she wasn't married to him, ie a successful singer. The only time when she was successful and married was when she followed her heart to studying physics-which was only one time out of many. 

Being from America, I did love how they portrayed college professors as being rich and affording big houses in Berkeley. If only!"
If I Hadnt Met You,"Wait, so he never came back to his original universe ?
How many versions of old Elisa did he interact with ?"
If I Hadnt Met You,Please explain this what do you mean by parallel life ? Parallel to what ? I would be really interested in your analysis
If I Hadnt Met You,I think that was just to illustrate his selfishness 
If I Hadnt Met You,Do what you want tbh I don’t have time to mod Discord or reddit set it up as you please.
If I Hadnt Met You,Can you explain this in detail I would love to know your thoughts
If I Hadnt Met You,Did you ever set one up?
If I Hadnt Met You,"I really don't understand what they're doing with season 9. Its like they're punished the viewers and CBS for keeping it going this long. We are more than halfway through this season, and there have been maybe two episodes that actually move along the only part of the plot that matters - meeting the mother. 

And it really doesn't help that Ted and The Mother have zero chemistry. I like Cristin Milioti, but I feel like she was just hastily and poorly cast in that role. 

The Victoria character got pretty bad throughout the seasons, the writers basically ruined her like they did with Ted, but she would have been a far better and believable Mother than the one they picked. 

Maybe this is all just a pick misdirect and in the finale we'll find out Ted and Robin really did get together and adopted a couple kids. Because at this point, no one will work with Ted. Realistically, Ted can't have a real lasting relationship with anyone other than Robin because he'll always be settling for them, instead of fully committing to them. I don't even really like Robin. The writers really wrecked all the characters on this show, with the exception of Marshall, who is just bad because its so obvious Jason Segal doesn't want to be there and is phoning it in.

This show is so infuriating. I have never loved and loathed a show like this before. "
If I Hadnt Met You,"Victoria was also ""The Mother"" for their first season if they hadn't been renewed."
If I Hadnt Met You,"Just shows how poorly this thing is being managed.

How I Met Your Mother...seven seasons ago.

This season, and honestly, the last few seasons, have dipped so much in quality that it's just sad now."
If I Hadnt Met You,That would have been intriguing in Season 1...the first Victoria episode still ranks amongst my favourites.  I agree that they did ruin her character as time went on.  I think they did the same thing with Nora too.
If I Hadnt Met You,"Thank god they didn't, that character is annoying."
If I Hadnt Met You,"Noooooooooo, not Victoria. Not at this point. Booo on that. 

And it must kind of suck for Jason Segal to have all that pressure to sign on for a 9th season so the cast and the crew could still have jobs. First World Problem, but still sucky. "
If I Hadnt Met You,[deleted]
If I Hadnt Met You,"Also, I've got to the point where I force myself to avoid looking at a clock while watching this show, so I don't get overwhelmed with rage and dread when nothing happens during the half hour. Each week I hope and pray that they'll move the story along instead of some bullshit slap bet-rhyming throwaway crap. They're treating season 9 like they have another 100 episodes to get to the Mother, when in reality they have, like, 9. "
If I Hadnt Met You,i dont get the hate for the new mother. In my opinion she is very good.
If I Hadnt Met You,"The problem is that Robin was always just super cool and neat and could hang out and relax, and she got more that way as time went on.

So the mother had to be even better and cooler than Robin so Ted would pick ""her,"" and that's really almost impossible at this point. Not because Robin is cool and whatever, but because Robin has had nine years of being awesome , and this chick will have only a couple of episodes against that comparison."
If I Hadnt Met You,"I thought they had always had potential mothers (robin, Victoria, Stella, zoey, etc) for each season but keep getting renewed. I'm kinda skeptical that a full 8 seasons had been decided since they weren't that great towards the end. "
If I Hadnt Met You,"Can't argue with you on that, but the latest season of this show has been terrible, I stopped watching it entirely."
If I Hadnt Met You,They did have that one on the lighthouse
If I Hadnt Met You,"That's why she has magically shown up when each of the main characters have needed her, even if it wasn't at the wedding, to solve their problems and show her true greatness."
If I Hadnt Met You,"I liked Zoey, haven't followed the show much since Lilly had that baby "
If I Hadnt Met You,"There have been a few decent episodes this season, but also lots of horrible stinkers. The one from this week, the only thing I could think of while watching it was ""I can't wait for this show to be finished.""."
If I Hadnt Met You,"Gotta finish. But I fall asleep all the time while watching, nothing, and I mean nothing is happening. "
If I Hadnt Met You,[deleted]
If I Hadnt Met You,"Ya, I officially threw in the towel halfway through that rhyming episode."
If I Hadnt Met You,It's a little sad that that's been their only interaction. I've given up on this season being good and am pretty much just watching to see it through to the end now that its actually ending.
If I Hadnt Met You,I've had to submit this twice today because whatever algorithm the /r/television automods use flagged it as a listicle.
If I Hadnt Met You,Jason Segal was almost the reason How I Met Your Mother ended
If I Hadnt Met You,Another Slapsgiving episode?
If I Hadnt Met You,It's 2023. The Mother passes away next year. It'd be nice to see some closure on that.
If I Hadnt Met You,I love these ‘actor shows interest in working and getting paid’ insights.
If I Hadnt Met You,Freaks and geeks season 2
If I Hadnt Met You,"I never finished the show during the original run and I'm about half way through at the moment and all I can think is ""what the fuck is that screenshot"""
If I Hadnt Met You,"HIMYF is pretty standard to me; HIMYM was never a knee-slapping romp anyway.  Where HIMYF does fall short is that it doesn’t have a bigger-than-life breakout character that captures the public’s attention like Barney did (and while I didn’t see last week’s episode, I’m not sure how much actual Barney can help).  I do like how HIMYF is keeping things simple, with the scaled down 10 eps per season streaming structure and the deliberate narrowing down of possible “father candidates,” so, unlike HIMYM, the titular character just can’t show up out of left field one day.  We won’t have to deal with 9 years and 208 episodes of Sophie Tompkins."
If I Hadnt Met You,"I watched the entire first season of HIMYF on a hangover day, it's terrible. I can't remember a single thing about it except that Hilary Duff was in it"
If I Hadnt Met You,"My first thought for a Marshall cameo would be Sophie ending up in front of him in court, but he's been a justice on the NY State Supreme Court since 2020, so that scenario seems unlikely.  It'll most likely be Marshall and Lily either checking out the old apartment, since that's where Sid and Jesse live, or a run in at McClaren's, like Robin."
If I Hadnt Met You,"Maybe they’ll do a scene where he steals someone’s cake, and lies about it despite having cake on his face

Edit: thanks for the award! Glad people remember the reference"
If I Hadnt Met You,"A run in at the Minnesota Vikings bar, just don't mention Gary Anderson or tell them that you are Canadian."
If I Hadnt Met You,show takes a turn towards the dramatic when its revealed Marshall has multiple families
If I Hadnt Met You,COME AGAIN FOR BIG FUDGE
The Disappearance of Madeleine McCann,"Something tells me this documentary series will point the fingers at the parents since they didn't want to participate in this documentary.  


Edit: Fuck...between the final part of season 5 of Arrested Development, this documentary, Love Death and Robots, AND Queer Eye season three....my weekend will be dedicated to Netflix haha"
The Disappearance of Madeleine McCann,"""Somebody knows what happened to Madeleine McCann""  ...  just attempt to think about knowing what her experience has been like.  Faaaaa  I dont  know how these people live with themselves.  Mind boggling."

The Disappearance of Madeleine McCann,[deleted]
The Disappearance of Madeleine McCann,Anyone else getting a little wary of documentaries presenting a point of view and society taking it as fact?
The Disappearance of Madeleine McCann,I don’t think her parents did it. I think they were negligent and poor Madeleine paid the price.
The Disappearance of Madeleine McCann,"I can't be the only one who is just sick of hearing her name?

After month after month of every newspaper's front page being her face and the news constantly being her crying parents, can you really blame people for sympathy turning into frustration?

Even after all this time, we can't just forget it and be allowed to going back to life without her being mentioned?

It might sound heartless, but there's only so much sympathy you can have for a complete stranger, and when that sympathy is forced from you day after day, it rots."
The Disappearance of Madeleine McCann,"The Madeleine McCann case is such a mess.

Yes, the parents were negligent in leaving their children unattended.  But it was a small resort, the restaurant was nearby and leaving kids asleep while you went to dinner was normal at this resort.  But the fact that they left them alone created a ton of anger towards the parents.

If you go through the timeline, Madeleine and her siblings were at the kids club until 6pm.  One of their friends stopped by the room at 6:30 and saw Madeleine.  Gerry (the McCann dad) was out and about until 7pm.  By 8:30, the parents were at the restaurant.  The timeline is crazy tight.  The McCanns would have had at most an hour and a half to dispose of Maddy's body in a foreign country without a rental car.  If you think the Mom (Kate) did it alone, she had two and a half hours.  Remember the McCanns had toddler twins in addition to Maddy, so those kids had to be somewhere while all this was going on.  [Link](https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2008/apr/11/madeleinemccann).

IMO, it is unlikely the McCann parents know where Maddy is.  But because they left their kids alone, suspicious has always focused on them.  Lots of people say the McCanns drugged their kids, but as far as I know, there is no evidence of that.  Mostly it turns into a circle jerk of people blaming the parents for leaving the kids alone.

I find interesting that the parents refused to participate.  A long documentary should get into the timeline issues and I think would probably lessen the anger at them."
The Disappearance of Madeleine McCann,/r/TheDisappearance for those intrested 
The Disappearance of Madeleine McCann,"This seems like pretty strong evidence.

> The police removed the silver Renault Scenic the McCanns had hired three weeks after the disappearance, and on 6 August Keela and Eddie were taken to an underground car park opposite the Polícia Judiciária headquarters in Portimão, where 10 cars were parked, 20–30 feet apart, including the McCanns' and Robert Murat's. Eddie, the cadaver dog, gave an alert outside the McCanns' car by the driver's door. The next morning Keela alerted to the rear driver's side inside the boot (trunk) and the map compartment in the driver's door, which contained the ignition key and key ring. When the key ring was hidden underneath sand in a fire bucket, she alerted again, as she did when the bucket was moved to a different floor of the car park. Almost immediately the Portuguese press began running stories that Madeleine had died inside apartment 5A."
The Disappearance of Madeleine McCann,"I'm on the second episode. Man, this documentary is packed with a lot of needless fluff."
The Disappearance of Madeleine McCann,Maybe the dingo ate your baby.
The Disappearance of Madeleine McCann,Time to cash in on that sweet tragedy
The Disappearance of Madeleine McCann,"The only reason they are not in prison is because they are posh as fuck

The Disappearance of Madeleine McCann,Another biased documentary based on bullshit no doubt? 
The Disappearance of Madeleine McCann,[deleted]
The Disappearance of Madeleine McCann,everyone thinks the parents did it so that would be the predictable route
The Disappearance of Madeleine McCann,The wide UK consensus is that they either did it (probably accidentally but still caused by neglect) or at the very least that some of the responsibility is on them for being so careless and neglecting. They certianly haven't done themselves any favours with how they've used to make themselves a huge pile of money since. I'd say any documentary that didn't take a very serious look at their role in this wouldn't be very honest.
The Disappearance of Madeleine McCann,"Here's hoping Netflix has some great lawyers, because Kate and Gerry McCann are infamous for how litigious they are whenever anybody questions their involvement with the disappearance.

They threatened to sue Twitter users, for fuck sake."
The Disappearance of Madeleine McCann,they would sue and get even richer
The Disappearance of Madeleine McCann,I read the documentary is going towards abduction  route and the McCanns didn’t want anything to do with the documentary. 
The Disappearance of Madeleine McCann,"I've been reading up on the disappearance of Asha Degree and its just begging for someone to take the time and money to explore it. 

The police released new information of items of interest in October 2018, someone on reddit uncovered a photo that has never been released to the public, and almost everyone involved says the parents completely innocent and want the story out there. But there are still a million theories, and so many people have never heard of her compared to JonBenet or Maddie. Having it be a netflix event might cause someone to remember something.

With true crime docs being the rage these days, it's a matter of if not when. "
The Disappearance of Madeleine McCann,[deleted]
The Disappearance of Madeleine McCann,"You could literally say that about anything. 

I could turn around and say that The Shawshank Redemption (spoilers ahead) is about a guy who gets framed for murder and escapes prison and that’s it. That doesn’t mean it isn’t a story worth telling.  "
The Disappearance of Madeleine McCann,"Imagine straight up saying that people don’t know what happened, and then in the literally the next sentence saying “there’s not much more to it”. 

Those are contradictory claims to one another bud. Obviously if people don’t know what happened, there’s more to the story that people don’t know. How you were up voted 40 times is a goddamn mystery too, or people are a lot stupider here than I thought. "
The Disappearance of Madeleine McCann,By making shit up and presenting rumours and the shit that comes out of Joe Public's mouth as fact. 
The Disappearance of Madeleine McCann,"They deffo killed her by accident then chucked her in the ocean. 

How they DIDNT get prosecuted for gross negligence and have their kids taken off them at the least I’ll never know. "
The Disappearance of Madeleine McCann,I'm done after 10 mins of the second episode. Really dull.
The Disappearance of Madeleine McCann,"It's entirely possible they are saying the truth, left her alone, and she died due to lack of supervision. Then they disposed the body and said she vanished. "
The Disappearance of Madeleine McCann,"To be fair we haven’t seen this one yet. It’s unlikely, but it could just be a balanced summary of probably the most famous unsolved crime in modern British history. Could also say Michael Jackson stole her though, we don’t know until it’s out."
The Disappearance of Madeleine McCann,"> Anyone else getting a little wary of documentaries presenting a point of view and society taking it as fact?

The recent Fyre double docs were the perfect example how misleading a documentary can be. 

From a production standpoint the Netflix one was a million times better (the Hulu doc felt like it was done by a youtuber in some parts), but the way they completely ignored FuckJerry was almost criminal, no idea why Netflix would give money for a documentary where people guilty of the event are actually producing the fucking thing."
The Disappearance of Madeleine McCann,This is my opinion too. Negligence and stupidity yes but I don’t think they killed her. 
The Disappearance of Madeleine McCann,I'm only sick of hearing about her name because it usually coincides with the force's annual taxpayer-funded ~~holiday~~ *investigation* in the Algarve.
The Disappearance of Madeleine McCann,"And think, we only had to hear about the Boko Haram girls for like a week "
The Disappearance of Madeleine McCann,"I know what you mean. JonBenét Ramsey was murdered in 1996 and some tabloids here are still running stories about ""Shocking Revelations and The Real Killers Found!"" It gets really old after a while."
The Disappearance of Madeleine McCann,"She fits that perfect angelic white blonde girl stereotype that pulls at the heartstrings. It’s a tragic case, no one can say they don’t feel desperately sad for the girl but there are hundreds probably thousands of missing cases that are always going to be in the shadow of this one. I always think of little Ben Needham who disappeared in Greece and his family got nowhere near the press coverage the MM case has. "
The Disappearance of Madeleine McCann,"I think at this point Madeline is either dead or will re appear somewhere as an adult, but 100% authorities will never find her via investigations, its been too long.

&#x200B;

That is why a lot of people get angry, because the amount of money spent on this one missing child case, mostly because her parents are upper class rich elites.

&#x200B;

if I had to guess, I would say she unfortunately died, and quite possibly due to some kind of accident or negligence on the part of her parents."
The Disappearance of Madeleine McCann,"The amount of time, money and resources spent on this one case is insane and appalling and its overshadowing the real tragedy of it all. I am 100 % in the parents are responsible side. Although the Podesta brothers being responsible has always been a fun conspiracy. "
The Disappearance of Madeleine McCann,">Madeleine and her siblings were at the kids club until 6pm

was she? since when? search for the in-on registry documents on that day and youll see that maddies name never checked in the kids club"
The Disappearance of Madeleine McCann,The fact they didn’t want to be a part of it screams it was their fault 
The Disappearance of Madeleine McCann,Maybe I’m reading this wrong but a car rented 3 weeks “after” the disappearance showed signs of a possible cadaver. So you think under enormous public scrutiny the McCanns has time to transport their daughters dead body undetected and had kept her somewhere before that hidden in the already tight timeline in a country they didn’t know? Or what am I missing because that sounds ridiculous to me thinking logically?
The Disappearance of Madeleine McCann,I don't know if they did or did not kill her but cadaver dogs aren't reliable. Most forensic evidence isn't. There is no evidence that the dogs don't simply bark at their trainer's command.
The Disappearance of Madeleine McCann,"The dogs just alerted to scent, it doesn't mean there is something, just that there could be something. DNA of the stuff from both places concluded no relevant match to anybody."

The Disappearance of Madeleine McCann,It’s scary that there’s a lot of evidence behind this but it probably won’t ever get brought up in the documentary 
The Disappearance of Madeleine McCann,"Dumbest theory so far, by a mile."
The Disappearance of Madeleine McCann,"I don’t think they did it but I do think they are at fault, I hope they go more in that direction with this documentary. "
The Disappearance of Madeleine McCann,"The theory about the parents never took off with me. I had a girl in school tell me all about the resort because she's been, she said that leaving the kids in the room and having staff check in on them was a legit service that hotel offered. "
The Disappearance of Madeleine McCann,Don't forget the fact that they sue pretty much anyone who questions their interpretation of events or their involvement.
The Disappearance of Madeleine McCann,"The consensus of everyone who half read one newspaper article  doesn't matter.   The parents deal with a loss of a child in a way you don't like or expect, and therefore they must be 100% guilty of something.... that's the stupid aspect of everything.   There is no one set way people deal with the entire world crumbling around them.   This belief a lot of people have that there is only one way people process these things just shows how stupid the average person really is.  

You need real evidence to blame the parents.  They clearly aren't master criminals who know to commit the perfect crime.  People who commit the perfect crime don't also make everyone suspect them.   

Remember the case of [Azaria Chamberlain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_of_Azaria_Chamberlain).  The parents  didn't act like everyone thought grieving parents should.  So they were not just suspected by everyone, but the courts literally just assumed they were guilty and convicted them of murdering their daughter.  Then they found the the remains of the dingo eaten baby after putting the mother in jail.  Because investigating the crime before you put them in jail is just too much to ask for. 

Every time something happens, there are always people who say ""clearly so-and-so is guilty"".   People who often have no idea what they are talking about.   Nobody should care what the round the water-cooler consensus of the mouth breathers might be.  "

The Disappearance of Madeleine McCann,"Agreed, I feel like guilt is the fuel for that campaign. They figured ""she'll be fine, we'll leave her here for a while, what's the worst that could happen?"" and they wouldn't be the only people who act like that, so they're not terrible people, they just didn't take enough precautions, and they're now wracked with guilt as any parent would be.

But as much sympathy as I had for them at the start, it's not my fault it happened, and I agree that enough if enough, why should she get special treatment when so many others are missing as well."

The Disappearance of Madeleine McCann,"yeah i agree with u. but it sickens me that someone would leave their young children alone for hours in a foreign country. i know they will never forgive themselves, but damn, thats the worst form of parenting. "
The Disappearance of Madeleine McCann,You are quite literally the only person i have come across that doesn't think the parents done it
The Disappearance of Madeleine McCann,"I don’t. Everyone knows they are at fault and it’s been discussed at length, all that discussion does is obfuscate the discussion on what actually happened and at some point it just becomes smug imo. I’d like them to examine a bunch of different theories rather than the parental one, which has been exhausted. "
The Disappearance of Madeleine McCann,"Was the service intended for kids that young? I could see how they'd offer it for like 10 year olds, but they seem a bit young to just drop by occasionally. It still feels a bit like neglect to me, leave your kids alone in a room in a foreign country for hours while you go get pissed with your mates. If they weren't Drs the media would have torn them apart.   


Tbh far more damning for me is the way they've acted since. Any chance they can milk some more money from it all they will. It just seems all very suspect. But I don't have all the info so I'm no expert tbf. "
The Disappearance of Madeleine McCann,"There is a service and no they didn’t participate in that service. It also wasn’t offered for children that age. Who in their right mind leaves 3 kids under 3 in a hotel? In a foreign country?? I actually question if this kid was even left alone in that room. From early on they felt their kids were drugged. When the police came they said they felt the kids weren’t behaving normally. They also admitted that their male friend bathed their daughter. Who does that? The mom ran downstairs leaving her twins behind saying “they took her” the dogs add another factor in this case. They hit on several things in that room. The mom stated that the window was wide open when she checked. The dad said he tested the window to see if anyone come enter. Oddly enough only her prints were found. There was zero evidence of a breakin and there were no prints/dna that were strange to the room. If people study this case you’ll never believe how much evidence suggests she wasn’t taken. All of these factors don’t make someone guilty but something happened on that trip and I don’t believe that poor kid was taken. I also find it incredibly curious the mom was the one who found she was missing and the friend who checked prior couldn’t remember if she was in bed or didn’t notice. At the least this kid was neglected, you never leave a toddler let alone 3 alone like that. "
The Disappearance of Madeleine McCann,"I think the resort commented that they do offer those services but that whilst the kids were left there, they didnt actually pay for that service. I could be wrong"
The Disappearance of Madeleine McCann,Sedating the children though? That’s not normal 
The Disappearance of Madeleine McCann,"Regardless, they definitely have deeper pockets to keep a case dragging along slowly in court until the parents eventually run out of money to pay for their legal team lol"
The Disappearance of Madeleine McCann,"Yeah they did, but it's important to remember ""Netflix"" themselves don't push agendas, the documentary filmmakers do. Some filmmakers have biases - the person who edited The Staircase is in a long-term relationship with the accused murderer for chrissakes. 

But despite what people say, there is value to essentially conducting a $25 million public investigation even if you intend to make the results public in an attempt to gain viewers. Cases like Asha's could really use the $25 million and a dedicated documentarian spending years trying to unravel the mystery as best they can."

The Disappearance of Madeleine McCann,"Nobody cares about the festival falling that wasn't the point of either doc. The Fyre festival scandal was only interesting because of the way they manipulated people into spending money into something that didn't exist using almost exclusively social media influencers (which FuckJerry was the primary player in), Fyre was the inbreed abortion of everything wrong with the modern internet ""social media"" culture and consumer culture."
"Love, Death and Robots",I seriously hope this series isn’t cancelled in the future. It has some of the best short movies I have seen.
"Love, Death and Robots",This episode reminded me a lot of that “100 artists created an animation from the same template” when she’s dragging the corpse behind her
"Love, Death and Robots",it's moebin time
"Love, Death and Robots","The Moebius art style was really well used, too. It looks deceptively simple, but moments like the figure falling into liquid were absolutely spectacular to watch. 

The short story it's based on has none of that Moebius vibe, but they tweaked it just enough to lend it a kind of dreamy existentialism that benefits from it.

This is one of my favorite short form stories in a very long time, I think it's the best thing LDR has done so far, and I hope to hell Netflix gives them another season."

"Love, Death and Robots",What episode is this?
"Love, Death and Robots","I disagree. I thought it was Night of the mini living dead. And I mean that whole heartedly. The rendering was gorgeous. That is if we are talking season 3 only.

Pop squad has some of the most incredible images in animation I’ve seen."
"Love, Death and Robots",Bad Traveling is one of the best things I’ve seen hands down
"Love, Death and Robots",This show is fucking epic
"Love, Death and Robots","I heard it was the first episode that made over a hundred moebillion dollars.

Edit: first one to make a morbius pun and it’s gets out-morbed by lazier comments :("

Utterly PHENOMENAL!!! I highly recommend it to anyone who’s a fan of animation and/or short-form storytelling."

Edit, the ship 1 with the crab was by far the best this season imo."
"Love, Death and Robots",someone say morbius?
"Love, Death and Robots",I just saw this episode. It was fantastic.
"Love, Death and Robots",Jean Giraud’s inspired illustrations influenced so many artists including me
"Love, Death and Robots",Definitely my favorite artsyle in the show
"Love, Death and Robots","My favorite episode, possibly of the whole series, and I love the Moebius influence.

I like that this season has leaned into some comic book style storytelling, with this and the bear episode."
"Love, Death and Robots","thought so , sweet"
"Love, Death and Robots","That was definitely my personal favorite however tied with Jibaro.

I loved the spiritual element of the character coming to terms with the totality of their death that was assuredly coming in the context of the ecosystem around them done in such a fantastical way. 

Also the animation and the warping environment was just jaw droppingly poetic and beautiful."
"Love, Death and Robots","I have the ~~incel~~ Incal out of the library and need to read it. 

Edit: wow that was a weird typo/autocorrect"
"Love, Death and Robots",Its morbin time
"Love, Death and Robots","Most beautiful? I really can't agree with that, there are a lot of beautiful episodes of this show. I also found this episode to be quite weak, probably bottom 5 of the entire show."
"Love, Death and Robots",Definitely Heavy Metal movie influence see the aspect in the art 1980 movie
"Love, Death and Robots","It's crazy how one French man inspired or help visualise so many iconic sci-fi movies.  Blade Runner, Alien, Tron, The Fifth Element, The Abyss."
"Love, Death and Robots","If I’m going to die, might as well do it high … 😎"
"Love, Death and Robots",If was eh imo. Cool but nothing crazy
"Love, Death and Robots",No it isn’t.
"Love, Death and Robots",This was the worst episode of the season imo.
"Love, Death and Robots",This one was my favorite as well.
"Love, Death and Robots",Love the art
"Love, Death and Robots",This entire season had some excellent episodes. The final episode was some of the most gorgeous cinematography I’ve ever scene.
"Love, Death and Robots",She has a grief trip while losing her love.  It was well written but like… no.  It’s on par with the others
"Love, Death and Robots","I thoroughly enjoyed this episode, but in now way did I see as deep into it as they are describing"
"Love, Death and Robots",[deleted]
"Love, Death and Robots","I got heavy vibes of Andrei Tarkovsky’s ‘Solaris’, anyone else?"
"Love, Death and Robots",Jibaro left me feeling uneasy to say the least.
"Love, Death and Robots","My favorites were bad traveling, masons rats, and jibaro."
"Love, Death and Robots","This is series is so under appreciated and i love that people continually keep on ""discovering"" it.   It's sort of a spiritual successor of MTV's Liquid Television, which i loved back in the day."
"Love, Death and Robots",This episode is the perfect example of a plot that will do well in a novel but bad in other media.
"Love, Death and Robots","I don't understand why people write articles with titles like these about a show that is so vastly different episode to episode, and which clearly divides people who watch it.

I don't remember all the episodes, but I found that one pretty unremarkable, and definitely not the most beautiful."
"Love, Death and Robots",Agreed.
"Love, Death and Robots",Nothing beats that first season
"Love, Death and Robots",Morbius?
"Love, Death and Robots",Morbius
"Love, Death and Robots",Crazy how Morbius tends to inspire so many people around the world!
"Love, Death and Robots",Morbius* haha silly typo in the title
"Love, Death and Robots",Yes. I also though it said Morbius. I need to cleanse my brain… with another viewing of the hit masterpiece Morbius.
"Love, Death and Robots",Watching this episode and Jibaro when I was high was the weirdest beautiful experience ever and I didn’t even realize what I was watching after a while
"Love, Death and Robots",Stand back! Im gonna morb!
"Love, Death and Robots","I don't know, I stand by 'beyond the aquellen rift'. Man, that's a good one."
"Love, Death and Robots","I don't really enjoy this season. too much 'monster and alien' type of episode for me. I prefer when they actually explore scifi concept like Pop squad, Snow in the Desert or when it's just artist having a blast imagine scifi concept like The Witness.

That being said I really like this episode more than I though I would. And the fact that this is the only episode that quenching my thirst for scifi make me enjoy it even more. My favorite of this season easily. (That and David Fincher episode because duh it's David fucking Fincher.)"
"Love, Death and Robots",PSA: not everything has to be a “love letter” ffs
"Love, Death and Robots","I watched it this week as my first viewing experience of the show and I was not impressed, to say the least. Very little substance and the awful, pretentious poetry didn't do it any favours.  I picked this episode based on several top 10 episodes rankings where it showed up. If this is the best this show has to offer, I guess it's not for me."
"Love, Death and Robots",It’s Moebin time
"Love, Death and Robots","My favorite part was when she started dragging the body and said ""It's moebin' time!""."
"Love, Death and Robots","You misspelled Morbius, but ok"
"Love, Death and Robots",It’s meobin time
"Love, Death and Robots",When Morbina says “i think we should Morb” I lost my mind. Beautiful episode indeed.
"Love, Death and Robots","For a sec I thought It said ""a love letter to Morbius""




.....Worst part is I got super excited..."
"Love, Death and Robots",It's Moebin' time.
"Love, Death and Robots",It’s Moebin’ time
"Love, Death and Robots","Mobius, Moebius. But we all know the best one is Morbius."
"Love, Death and Robots",Moeb sweep
"Love, Death and Robots",It’s morbin time
"Love, Death and Robots","No, no I don’t think so."
"Love, Death and Robots",Don’t tell me how to feel
"Love, Death and Robots","Nah, it was definitely the crab one."
"Love, Death and Robots",No it wasn't. It was the deaf knight one.
"Love, Death and Robots",I didn't make it past the first few lines of dialogue. Oof.
"Love, Death and Robots",It's morbin time
"Love, Death and Robots",A love letter to Morbius :)
"Love, Death and Robots",It's Morbin' time!
"Love, Death and Robots",It’s morbin time
"Love, Death and Robots",time to morb 😂
"Love, Death and Robots",Why does everyone love Morbius?
"Love, Death and Robots","Yeah, but there were no men in it, so it's the weakest episode of the season.


-Every halfwit on the internet crawling out to review it."
"Love, Death and Robots",some apex legends animation
"Love, Death and Robots",It’s moebin’ time
"Love, Death and Robots",Lucky it wasn’t a love letter to Morbius…
"Love, Death and Robots",Its moebing time
"Love, Death and Robots",Morbius
"Love, Death and Robots","It’s moebin time

Edit: kill me"
"Love, Death and Robots","Sorry, misread that as “Morbius.”"
"Love, Death and Robots",It's Moebin' time
"Love, Death and Robots",Love letter to Morbius? Nice
"Love, Death and Robots",It's moebin time
"Love, Death and Robots",It’s Moebin’ Time!
"Love, Death and Robots",I thought this said “a love letter to Morbius” and now I am very disappointed.
"Love, Death and Robots",It’s Moebin time
"Love, Death and Robots",Morbious
"Love, Death and Robots",Imagine how great it could have been as a love letter to Morbius…
"Love, Death and Robots",Wish it was a love letter to Morbius.
"Love, Death and Robots",Morbius? ITS MORBIN TIME!!!!!!
"Love, Death and Robots",This show is like a  cyberpunk fantasy for stupid people
"Love, Death and Robots",A love letter to morbius
"Love, Death and Robots",Morbius🗿
"Love, Death and Robots",They spelled morbius wrong
"Love, Death and Robots",Morbius*
Turn Up Charlie,Trailer didn't do the series justice either. This article pretty much reiterates what the trailer shows. It's just Idris Elba trying to prove he's good at being a DJ... 
Turn Up Charlie,"Has Idris ever been good in a comedy?

&#x200B;

I like him as an actor but to me comedy doesn't suit him."
Turn Up Charlie,"Oh Stringer, he will always be Stringer to me."
Turn Up Charlie,Vanity projects are almost always somewhat embarrassing.
Turn Up Charlie,I thought he was funny/less serious in Rockn Rolla 
Turn Up Charlie,"It seems like he's trying to soften his image a bit, like The Rock. You get offered more work, you have a higher profile, you make more money. But I doubt it will work for him, he just doesn't come off as naturally funny."
Turn Up Charlie,"Hes a great straight man, I think he needs a silly person partner though. Maybe like a Stephen merchant. Mark Wahlberg is nothing without will Ferrell."
Turn Up Charlie,"Yes, Charles, you wanted me. "
Turn Up Charlie,"The kid isn't cute, she's annoying. Auntie and his bruh tho, are gems."
Turn Up Charlie,"I prefer the original, “Good Luck Charlie”"
Turn Up Charlie,Will probably be cancelled 
Turn Up Charlie,[deleted]
Turn Up Charlie,"Jesus fuck there’s some hate for the show here, but for all the wrong reasons. Idris is fine, all the characters are fine but the little girl is isuffurble to /r/hittablefaces levels of hate. Not the girl herself, but the character she’s playing.  Like 10x worse than the teen in Punisher (in the beginning anyway)"
Turn Up Charlie,I thought this was a great show.
Turn Up Charlie,"Idris Elba is a beautiful man.

Unfortunately he knows it.

He's so far up his own arse it puts me off watching him, which is a shame because he is fiiiiiine. "
Turn Up Charlie,"You guys, it pains me to say this, but... I think Idris might be corny as hell."
Turn Up Charlie,I don't get why he wanted to make a show where he's a part time nanny
Turn Up Charlie,"> And it shows a softer side of the reigning Sexiest Man Alive by letting him **bond** early and often with a cute but troubled kid 

&#x200B;

This may be a little tinfoil-hat but this line of the article felt like poor writing and just an excuse to throw the word ""bond"" in the article so that it's a top result in the event anyone googles ""Idris Elba James Bond"" 

&#x200B;"
Turn Up Charlie,some shows just should not get made bro 
Turn Up Charlie,Idris Alba's version of a midlife crisis?
Turn Up Charlie,He’s a great actor and a great human being! As far as am concerned he can do whatever the hell he wants 
Turn Up Charlie,This show is horrible too..
Turn Up Charlie,This isn't the direction I was hoping Elba's career would go. I was hoping for him to become an action star or a big dramatic actor. Especially after seeing him in Beasts of no Nation.
Turn Up Charlie,Well I guess Netflix needed something else to fill the category of ‘needless vanity project’ 
Turn Up Charlie,Is he good at being a DJ?
Turn Up Charlie,"He played it straight so probably why it worked, but he was fine in Finding Dory and Zootopia. "
Turn Up Charlie,Only in his greatest role ever as Charles Miner.
Turn Up Charlie,He hosted SNL last week? You should watch it!
Turn Up Charlie,The Office?
Turn Up Charlie,He was good in the office but his comedy in that stemmed from the fact that he was being a normal person in an office fool of comedic characters which made the normal shit he did funny 
Turn Up Charlie,"He is pretty fun in ""Rocknrolla""
"
Turn Up Charlie,I think he could pull of something like a Captain Holt in Brooklyn 99. Complete deadpan delivery but with great writing he would have no problem
Turn Up Charlie,The Office
Turn Up Charlie,He was great in the office
Turn Up Charlie,Quite liked this comic relief sketch he did https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CVrUFSFHag
Turn Up Charlie,Rock n Rolla was comedic!
Turn Up Charlie,He was good in Rock'n Rolla.
Turn Up Charlie,"Stringer has some funny moments.""Tall man gonna be there when I stomp your fucking head?""
The ""taking notes on a criminal conspiracy"" part also springs to mind."
Turn Up Charlie,"He was Charles Minor in the office and did a great job. To be fair, his character was very serious but that was the whole joke. "
Turn Up Charlie,"Me too. 

It's still odd hearing him have that Brit accent. "
Turn Up Charlie,Get on with it motherfucker
Turn Up Charlie,Still waiting for the return...
Turn Up Charlie,I'm curious as to why you chose The Rock as a comparison? Hasn't he always had a soft image?
Turn Up Charlie,"Lets have James Roday do it.

He can just pretend the other guy is Gus the whole time."
Turn Up Charlie,"Elba needs to be the antagonist on next season’s Barry, where the gag is that he shows up and starts wanting to do hitman and dirty cop roles. For the balance of the plot line Barry can’t figure out if he’s an assassin sent to kill him, an undercover cop, or a fellow actor. 

*It also kind of looked like Barry was writing in the trailer, maybe the B plot is he’s getting it produced, directed by Winkler, and Elba is the student that gets casts as the main character."
Turn Up Charlie,[deleted]
Turn Up Charlie,Maybe. Maybe not. Maybe fuck yourself.
Turn Up Charlie,He's a peacock!  He doesn't need Will Ferrell to shine!
Turn Up Charlie,"Honestly, It's not her worst plan."
Turn Up Charlie,"If you mean his buddy Dell (played by Guz Khan), check out this show ""Man Like Mobeen"". He's the lead and it's fucking hilarious. (He also has a small role in ""Borderline"", which isn't as good but is still pretty funny.) I agree with you that the kid is a shitty actor, thought this would have been a decent show without her."
Turn Up Charlie,Minor? I barely know her!
Turn Up Charlie,"In character, as a brooding detective cracking skulls and struggling with deep existential crises? Amazing. So compelling, let me have your children.

As himself??? Dude is SO corny. His music video he released? Lol. Dude is definitely someone’s corny uncle still tryna impress younger women at the club while his wife is at home cooking for his cheesy ass."
Turn Up Charlie,"It's more of a coming of age story. He's a nanny, but it's more his rich friends feeling pitty on him/he isn't afraid of the kid.

I have actually enjoyed it quite a bit."
Turn Up Charlie,This comment is a great example of Toxic Positivity.
Turn Up Charlie,Well he's got a role in the fast and furious spinoff and he's replacing will Smith as dead shot in the suicide squad reboot. So he's got action roles on the way. 
Turn Up Charlie,"He is, actually. He comes up in /r/DJs every so often and is generally praised, despite his fame. You can see some of his sets on YouTube.

Here's an example: https://youtu.be/UFDaWJUzkm0"
Turn Up Charlie,Haven't got a clue but he keeps doing projects surrounding it so he has to be decent enough
Turn Up Charlie,He’s actually playing Coachella this year
Turn Up Charlie,Yeah. He’s a fine straight man. Which is an important part of a lot of comedies. What would Chris Farley have been without David Spade?
Turn Up Charlie,And The Office
Turn Up Charlie,"I wouldn't call his role in Finding Dory ""playing it straight"" "
Turn Up Charlie,"Playing it straight means like “dry” or “unemotional” in this context?

I’m just asking, because I’ve not heard that expression"
Turn Up Charlie,"Really? While I don’t think he was the biggest problem with the episode, that was not a good SNL. And I’m not someone that just shits on new SNL, the episode before it with Mulaney was amazing. "
Turn Up Charlie,He played the most serious person in that entire show.
Turn Up Charlie,[deleted]
Turn Up Charlie,That’s great. The onion line at 3:15 is perfectly delivered. Also love the coats. 
Turn Up Charlie,"Me too, I’m guessing it would cost a lot to get Butler, Elba, Strong, Hardy and find free time for Ludacris lol "
Turn Up Charlie,Are you forgetting about his time in the WWE
Turn Up Charlie,"I chose him because he is more or less at the top of the ultra-masculine acting game. The Rock has done a lot of family friendly stuff, but he has also done a lot of hard core action and he-man roles. Idris is only getting the masculine stuff, and if he wants to climb that hill any higher, he needs to widen his appeal. 

On the other hand, Idris has the reputation for being a really great actor, something that The Rock doesn't have. I could see Idris being tapped to play Hamlet, but it would be literally laughable if it were The Rock."
Turn Up Charlie,Rocks are typically very hard.
Turn Up Charlie,“No I haven’t heard about Pluto. Please tell me more.”
Turn Up Charlie,"""That's not Gus, that's clearly another black man but who's British and way more muscular.""

""I've seen Gus both ways. Come on Lassie, who among us hasn't had the odd British Bulk transformation? I know I have."""
Turn Up Charlie,Hell no. Michael Dapaah lmao. The glorified meme. His Comedy is incredibly niche and not very refined. 
Turn Up Charlie,"I get that you might want to act against type now and again, but... ah man. That music video for Boasty just pours gasoline on his cool cred and lights a match."
Turn Up Charlie,This comment is a great example of pointless buzzwords
Turn Up Charlie,agreed
Turn Up Charlie,I’m sure that is good DJin these days.  I have a hard time telling what is good and what isn’t.  Is he just planning different digital tracks?
Turn Up Charlie,Living in a van down by the river?
Turn Up Charlie,Best straight/funny man combination I've seen recently was Donny and Brad in Wolf of Wall Street. The suitcase handoff scene was so absurd.
Turn Up Charlie,10 feet under apparently 
Turn Up Charlie,"""I'm aware I have that effect on women"""
Turn Up Charlie,I didn't like him in the office at all. He was just an obtuse dick.
Turn Up Charlie,[deleted]
Turn Up Charlie,"I have never seen The office. 

I know, I know..."
Turn Up Charlie,"The character was kind of over the top, I felt he played it pretty straight all things considered though. Maybe I remember it wrong."
Turn Up Charlie,"Serious, no silliness or goofy stuff."
Turn Up Charlie,"The mean he played the straight man, the two expressions aren't really interchangeable even though there is some conceptual overlap. "
Turn Up Charlie,"Watch [Abbott and Costello do Who's On First](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sShMA85pv8M): Abbott (the tall guy in the baseball uni) is the straight man, he understands the situation and presents factual information; the comedy arises when Costello can't understand the difference between a confusing proper noun and a noun (and because English-only Americans generally don't understand the difference between who and whom and thus don't hear how weird it sounds). "
Turn Up Charlie,"Yeah, the Game show bit and the Sky Sports soccer bit was hilarious but the rest of it was just ok. "
Turn Up Charlie,"> the episode before it with Mulaney was amazing

Dude that episode was *fantastic*....

Yeah Idris did a decent job I thought (the gold diggers sketch was funny) - but he's no comedic actor. Sort of like how Daniel Craig is great in a comedy playing it straight (like Logan Lucky)...but when he tries to be ""funny"" he falls flat!"
Turn Up Charlie,"Agreed.   I’ve liked a lot of this new SNL season, but Idris just didn’t show any comedic chops in his episode.   

Not every actor can do everything, he’s still really talented.  He just did about exactly what you’d expect a long time theater actor turned long time serious drama actor would do if you put them on SNL.  "
Turn Up Charlie,That was one of my favorite SNL's in a loooong time.
Turn Up Charlie,I thought it was solid. The writhing in general these last few years has been pretty good
Turn Up Charlie,I'VE BEEN UP FOR A WHILE
Turn Up Charlie,"That's the joke.

EDIT: Him being no-nonsense, being irresistible to women, petty, aggressive and *then* becoming a kiss-ass is hilarious. He's just unlikable, like the characters of the UK Office.

It was refreshingly down-to-earth when the show was 60% on its way to abandoning all realism in the show. When Charles leaves, the U.S. Office never goes back to its season 1-3 style."
Turn Up Charlie,[deleted]
Turn Up Charlie,"He wasn't supposed to be funny. He was there to make Michael's attempts at humor seem extra cringey. One of my favorite parts from the show is when Michael thinks ""Saticoy Steel"" is his wife's name."
Turn Up Charlie,"I know I don’t have all the problems of a famous entertainer (some serious, some lol), but that just seems like such a fun project that I would MAKE time for it, dammit!"
Turn Up Charlie,"You know, honestly, I kind of did. Even then, I don't think I would compare the Rock WWE character to the very serious Idris Elba?"
Turn Up Charlie,"Haha that's great, I could definitely see that.

But now I just want Idris Elba to play Pierre Despereaux's version of Gus. I can see the mirror gags now."
YooHoo to the Rescue,"Watched this for the first time a few months ago. Can’t believe I put it off so long, one of the best shows I’ve seen."
YooHoo to the Rescue,Nuts
YooHoo to the Rescue,"Band of Brothers, The Pacific, and Generation Kill are the best war shows I have ever seen."
YooHoo to the Rescue,My favorite miniseries of all time. Brilliant from the first shot and never takes its foot off the gas.
YooHoo to the Rescue,"Yuck, didn’t realise Lewis was so privileged and Etonian to boot."
YooHoo to the Rescue,Try the Pacific and generation kill next. Then report back!
YooHoo to the Rescue,"For the record, The Pacific isn't as great as Band of Brothers. I think part of the problem is that you're following individual soldiers in that story, rather than a whole company. That's hard to avoid--the meatgrinder of the Pacific war meant whole companies just didn't stay whole, and people got moved and transferred a lot. But it makes for a harder to follow when you have several different plot threads, and each one changes location and cast regularly. 

Generation Kill is absolutely brilliant, but in a way vastly different from BoB. Band of Brothers inspires feelings of awe and gratitude; Generation Kill inspires a feeling of what-the-fuck. The sheer level of incompetence, grandstanding, and assholery that the guys depicted in Generation Kill had to put up with *from their own superiors* is mind-boggling. One of my favorite quotes out of the show is one Marine saying to another ""It's not the Hajis (Iraqis) that are gonna kill us, it's fuckin' Command."""
YooHoo to the Rescue,"As a former Marine, I’m ashamed I haven’t watched The Pacific yet, but I can say that Generation Kill is one of the best, if not the best depictions of Marine Corps infantry life. We fucking loved that show."
YooHoo to the Rescue,The pacific made me cry. Generation kill was incredible as well. Quality miniseries.
YooHoo to the Rescue,Really? That's cool to read. I'll have a new perspective next time I watch it
YooHoo to the Rescue,I imagine she's not looking forward to spending another 7 months alone in Romania shooting season 2.
YooHoo to the Rescue,"She's not making any friends in the writer's room, I'm sure, but everything quoted in the article about Wednesday is accurate.

The show is infinitely better during the first, Burton episodes, the love triangle is forced and stupid, some of Wednesday's dialogue is completely facile, forced, and out of character."
YooHoo to the Rescue,">There was a line about a dress she has to wear for a school dance and she says, ‘Oh my god I love it. Ugh, I can’t believe I said that. I literally hate myself.’ I had to go, ‘No.’”

Hell, that is some bad writing, kudos to her for not just going along with it, despite her young age. But now she seems to become the next big thing, so I guess it worked out."
YooHoo to the Rescue,I don't like how much this sounds like the Witcher writing room.
YooHoo to the Rescue,Her criticism about the writing actually reads pretty mild. Sounds like she had to rein some thing in because they just didn't fit right.
YooHoo to the Rescue,Wednesday didn’t feel like the Addams Family. It felt like they used it as a skin to do a typical teen mystery show.
YooHoo to the Rescue,"I thought it was weird that they had a forced love storyline and turned Wednesday into a hero.

In the first episode she dumps piranhas in a pool. She should've stayed chaotic evil."
YooHoo to the Rescue,"Good lord, she's not holding back. It's a shame that the show that got her so popular wasn't as enjoyable to work on as she probably would have hoped. Hopefully her reputation leads to projects she's more passionate about though, because she seems a lot more interested in bigger projects than teen drama, which, y'know, good for her."
YooHoo to the Rescue,"I'm always curious as to why certain shows blow up the way they do. 

I thought Wednesday was pretty average to be honest."
YooHoo to the Rescue,[deleted]
YooHoo to the Rescue,Listening to interviews with her you can tell she’s really into film. If that’s what she wants to do then all the power to her
YooHoo to the Rescue,"It's a real shame this article fails to mention she's been bumped up to executive producer on Season 2, which is a big deal."
YooHoo to the Rescue,It's great to see an actor so aware of the character to help improve the show.  Disappointing that they have to do it secretly.  I imagine The Witcher would be a better show if Henry Cavill's input was taken more seriously than the show runners who don't like the source material.
YooHoo to the Rescue,"I guess she's trying to go the robert pattinson route, the problem is wednesday was way better received than twilight, and she's the sole face of the project. I don't think it will end up going well for her, to be honest."
YooHoo to the Rescue,"All this ""controversy"" is so cringe. The show isn't a masterpiece, it's a decent tween drama with a solid premise that falls into classic tropes.not only that but it's clear they want to franchise so hard.


An actor is allowed to not love the work they are a part of, and not want to sign on to being a single character for the next 10 years BCS execs want to churn out an endless line of spin offs for an attempt at an infinite money glitch"
YooHoo to the Rescue,Talk about confidence. I'd have taken the first offer to be in a Netflix show.
YooHoo to the Rescue,Let’s acknowledge the possibility that this is all just marketing to blur her character and public persona like they did with Aubrey Plaza.
YooHoo to the Rescue,"I was so underwhelmed with Wednesday, I was expecting something darker not some teen mystery shit.

I have enjoyed Jennas other work and do look forward to her films."
YooHoo to the Rescue,The writers just wanted to make another 08/15 teen highschool drama out of wednesday.
YooHoo to the Rescue,"Legend. The show needed to end after 1 season, and now it can."
YooHoo to the Rescue,She's probably still pissed at them for making her keep working when she blatantly had COVID and was just just waiting on the test results
YooHoo to the Rescue,If she didn’t want it to be a hit she shouldn’t have made it better by pushing back against the insipid teen drama shit they were trying to pull off.
YooHoo to the Rescue,">“Everything that Wednesday does, everything I had to play, did not make sense for her character at all.""

Netflix writers and not understanding the source material, name a more iconic due."
YooHoo to the Rescue,Even Katherine Heigl is rolling her eyes at this one.
YooHoo to the Rescue,Ironically anti-Ortega article that explains why she is right
YooHoo to the Rescue,"It's unfortunate that her lack of workplace experience is showing in these exchanges. Her popularity exploded thanks to this show, but the public's love is fickle. They don't take kindly when they think you ungrateful.

Jennifer Lawrence learned the hard way that it's a small trip between internet darling to internet boogeyman."
YooHoo to the Rescue,"Given that the WGA are negotiating a new contract and may strike in May, it was incredibly ill advised to make these comments. She may find out sooner rather than later how hard it is to make a tv show without them."
YooHoo to the Rescue,I’m sure George Clooney would have preferred Movies as well when cast for E.R.
YooHoo to the Rescue,"TV is such a communal endeavor, and having input from actors on the scripts and their characters is invaluable. Disagreements on creative are going to happen and its good that Jenna had a POV and told the writers as such for the betterment of the series. That being said, dragging the writers and other crew like this in such a public way is really unprofessional and simply unnecessary. Other cast and crew could go their entire lives and never work on a show as popular as Wednesday, and now knowing that the star hates it this much, looks down on it in many ways, and wishes she was doing something else is an unbelievable downer. It's completely fine for Jenna to feel this way, I have no issue with that. But repeatedly discussing it in the press is wrong and ultimately hurtful."
YooHoo to the Rescue,It's so crazy how after hype dies down everyone is so willing to say the show isn't as good as everyone originally tried to make it sound like it was.
YooHoo to the Rescue,Glad to see people see this show for the overrated teen schlock that it is
YooHoo to the Rescue,"Not being successful; that’s a bold strategy Cotton, let’s see if it plays out for her."
YooHoo to the Rescue,I did not like the show tbh. Didn’t get the hype at all. Just seemed like another angsty teen Netflix show with a recognizable brand and director attached to it.
YooHoo to the Rescue,Just don’t do season 2 then.
YooHoo to the Rescue,"Some of these actors are unbelievable. A starring role, millions of dollars and still they are not happy."
YooHoo to the Rescue,"One of the writers is responding to her on Twitter, calling her out. But with the things she said she changed I feel like the only way it will play out is that writer won’t be able to return for next season. She’s much more important to the show and I feel like it was a mistake on his part to respond publicly.

https://imgur.com/a/Fyl5BPS/"
YooHoo to the Rescue,"Oh sure, she hates all the success lol. She’s young and dumb like all of us at that age."
YooHoo to the Rescue,I gotta be honest... I'm a little shocked that the show was as popular as it was. I grew up with the original movies and the cartoons and didn't think it would really be such a hit with the modern crowd.
YooHoo to the Rescue,"They can change the whole writer's room, and it would probably benefit the show. They can't change the lead actress without tanking the show. JO knows that. I don't blame her for not wanting to get stuck on some mediocre CW show and watching her career get tied to that kind of junk. She is right to speak out. Wednesday is mediocre, but has the potential to be good. Let it be good."
YooHoo to the Rescue,The first mistake is thinking she’s not replaceable. Everyone is.
YooHoo to the Rescue,Really looking forward to her no longer being the flavour of the month.
YooHoo to the Rescue,It’s obvious she’s already over doing scary/horror.
YooHoo to the Rescue,The Honest Trailer for Wednesday really nails this
YooHoo to the Rescue,Jenna Ortega; I didn’t ask for this 🥴
YooHoo to the Rescue,"Honestly, the series felt really corny.  The writing and plot were so teen driven and predictable.  I watched it with my 8 and 10yr old.  They loved it, it worked for a family show.  But it wasn't written well at all.  I guessed every silly plot point the entire way.  Jenna carried this thing on her back.  I kind of hope they wrap in s2 and she can go on to do better things."
YooHoo to the Rescue,I am always surprised that she is just 1.55m.
YooHoo to the Rescue,"Can’t blame her. She’s really talented. Wednesday’s fun, but move on."
YooHoo to the Rescue,The Henry Cavill syndrome. Love it.
YooHoo to the Rescue,"I'm honestly surprised by how many in here dislikes the show, or only likes the first two episodes, because ""Burton"".  
 I had no Idea he was only involved in the first two episodes. I think the show was quite good, so does everyone else I have talked to about it.  
Also in this interview she's so ""in character"" that I would guess it's part of marketing for the show. It seems like everyone in here is taking it at face value? Am I missing something?"
YooHoo to the Rescue,Sometimes it’s scheduling…a movie requires them to shoot for 6 weeks and maybe a few reshoots but a tv show requires a lot more time
YooHoo to the Rescue,And look because of the show she's starting in a Beetlejuice sequel with Michael Keaton.
YooHoo to the Rescue,"My niece loves this show so that’s cool, but I can’t see myself ever watching an episode of this."
YooHoo to the Rescue,Probably doesn’t wanna be trapped for 7 seasons
YooHoo to the Rescue,"Thank God, because I know I can’t live without the stellar acting in films the like of SCREAM 10

/s"
YooHoo to the Rescue,"As someone with really specific tastes in show that usually hates mainstream things, I absolutely loved Wednesday beginning to end. Something about it just felt like a geniune effort from a team to make a fun show with a teen thematic. It felt like discovering a super fun show on TV back in the 2000s, not just another entry in the endless things under either DC, Marvel or weird solo actor projects that end up big only because of Controversy. Ironically, for all the teen dialogue, Wednesday actually made me feel quite young and innocent again while watching it, despite some of the dark subject matter.  


  
I honestly feel much of the people hating on Burton and his writers for this show just shows how much differently they approached this show compared to other modern hits. Their writing wasn't focused on tying it into weird worldbuilding and lore, or shocking viewers with random deaths, etc. They just went it at from a very clear goal and aim for the kind of things Wednesday as a character would work with and the stuff she wouldn't. This is especially fine considering that contrary to what most people are saying here, almost NONE of the Wednesday family members have ever had any sort of consistant characterization, especially Wednesday. They're all ""weird"" but the way in which they express it in their dialogue has never been a standard in any of the versions of the family. Wednesday here I feel actually did by far the best job of combining the aspects of a loving family with one that is weird not just because of their gothic style, but because they're geniunely involved in fucked up shit like murder plots and more. Wednesday herself felt interesting to watch as her dialogue wasn't just a gimmick. Her constant bite at other characters ends having both small and big consequences, from pushing people away even when she doesn't want to, to almost killing one of the people she actually considers a friend.  


  
This show honestly feels old in the best ways possible while still being awesome in terms of camera work and pacing and I really hope they stick with it instead of just forcing itself to be new and hip like people in these comments want it to."
YooHoo to the Rescue,She is really putting her foot in her mouth recently isn't she?
YooHoo to the Rescue,Loser didn't even eat real chicken on hot ones.
YooHoo to the Rescue,"I really dislike her attitude and demeanour. I know a lot of people are loving her “girl boss” nature - which is a weird trend right now where people are celebrating female celebrities for being rude and off putting for some reason. 

I just really don’t need to hear celebrities whinging. The gall she has to criticise the writing team and complain about it proves how untouchable she feels and how lucky she is. The average population has to do things they don’t want to do at work. Instead of whinging about what you have to do, why not express gratitude. She has plenty of films on her resume and can keep doing it in the future. She will not struggle to be booked, and she knows it, which is why she has such an asshole attitude. 

She is pretentious and I’m completely over hearing about her interviews. I’ve never seen anything from her except for frowning and bitching, or just being unbelievably rude to interviewers. 

Her attitude has deterred me from viewing things she is in because now her acting just annoys me. 

She is ridiculously cocky and the complete opposite of down to earth. See Brendan Fraser and  Ke Huy Quan at the Oscar’s the other day - imagine Jenna in their place. I’m tired of celebrating celebrities like her and would much rather celebrate the ones who are grateful"
YooHoo to the Rescue,"This is starting to give me shades of Jennifer Lopez' ""Movieline"" interview back in 1998 when she was first blowing up (basically trashed a bunch of actors & scripts as she felt pretty untouchable at the time).

&#x200B;

I get that Ortega might be unhappy with some of the writing - I get that she may prefer film to TV.  She may regret playing it out in public as much as she has been."
YooHoo to the Rescue,"Girl, just be happy you’re an artist getting a hefty paycheck to do something you love for a living."
YooHoo to the Rescue,"She is right though, the plot is beyond stupid and full of tiktok baiting scenes."
YooHoo to the Rescue,😭 I’m too popular and have too much money- Her
YooHoo to the Rescue,"I do feel bad for actors giving shows a chance, trying to pad their resume, and the show becomes this cultural phenomenon and now they have to spend the rest of their life playing and reliving that character and acting like it was this great experience. Even if they go on to do work they love and are proud of, its that one character they'll be asked about."
YooHoo to the Rescue,"So girl get popular but wishes she wasn't on popular show to do film to become popular?  

Did I get that right because from what I've seen, she's everywhere now and doesn't seem to be not enjoying the spotlight?"
YooHoo to the Rescue,This must be her 15 minutes of fame that she's being plugged roughly every fifth article.
YooHoo to the Rescue,the fandom for this girl hasn't even formed yet and she's already alienating the hell out of everyone
YooHoo to the Rescue,She's kinda starting to annoy me and she's to young for that. Quit it.
YooHoo to the Rescue,"I liked this girl (as in public person) at first, but after seeing some recent public appareances, I feel she believes she is entitled.   


Just my feeling."
YooHoo to the Rescue,"Sounds to me like she wants to be on that Robert Pattinson, Daniel Radcliffe abstract film actor in a rush. She’s barely been famous for a year and she already wants what they spent about a decade of work doing and building a reputation and their acting skills. Girl needs to chill out and just ride the wave and fluff her resume"
YooHoo to the Rescue,"People are so negative. I thought it was a decent show. That being said, Ortega obviously helped a lot."
YooHoo to the Rescue,"In another universe she could be a waitress in LA trying to land a commercial

In this one she's a 20-year old multimillionaire"
YooHoo to the Rescue,She is sounding more and more insufferable every time she talks. Hate to tell her but Hollywood history is littered with young starlets just like her.  There are 50 girls waiting in the wings to take her place.
YooHoo to the Rescue,"I mean people are sucking her off now, but I’ve seen Scream this weekend and it was meh, but her performance was a standout in terms of how bad it was. Like shockingly bad. In Wednesday she didn’t have to emote, but I reckon the more she stars in projects where she actually has to act, the more people will realize that she’s not all that."
YooHoo to the Rescue,"the show is good and all, but Wednesday herself seems like from a different world than everyone else. That's the point, yes, but if she's so obsessed with death and pain and loneliness how... is it... that she's the most popular girl in school with all these friends and love interests? it just doesn't fit.  It's incredibly CW.  I wish there was a bit more ACTUAL gothic odd-ness going on in the story."
YooHoo to the Rescue,"I never watched it, seemed overrated."
YooHoo to the Rescue,">There was a line about a dress she has to wear for a school dance and she says, ‘Oh my god I love it. Ugh, I can’t believe I said that. I literally hate myself.’ I had to go, ‘No.’”

""Oh my god, I love it"" is never something Wednesday Adams should say. Fire the writer who wrote that line for her."
YooHoo to the Rescue,Girl has one hit show and thinks she is Streep.
YooHoo to the Rescue,She sounds like a spoiled brat.
YooHoo to the Rescue,So tired of hearing about this actor and how the show supposedly revolves around her decisions (and not the showrunner/writer/director/studio). Such PR nonsense.
YooHoo to the Rescue,Ahh tv is so much better than film these days… you’d think these kids would get that.
YooHoo to the Rescue,"I get where she is coming from (not wanting to be stuck doing this show for years) but she has got to stop slagging off the thing that has brought her the success she is now enjoying.

She is a professional. There is a way to handle frustration with a project and slamming it in the press ain't the way to go about it."
YooHoo to the Rescue,She better be careful or she’ll end up like Constance Wu if she comes off as too ungrateful.
YooHoo to the Rescue,She uh... really wants to just tank the goodwill she gained in the last year hm?
YooHoo to the Rescue,Wow starting to really not like her
YooHoo to the Rescue,Man if i had a nickle when an actor who got famous thanks to some  tv show thought they should do movies and are for movies. I'd have lots of nickles.
YooHoo to the Rescue,Such an annoying face
YooHoo to the Rescue,"I liked Wednesday, but Ortega gave off an off putting vibe on SNL."
YooHoo to the Rescue,"Haven't watched the show, but the headline immediately made me think of Krusty the Klown.  

Basically ""They asked me to do their crappy show, and I threw those phony suits out on their ass!  Then they came back with a dump truck full of money...  and I just had no choice."""
YooHoo to the Rescue,I still can’t figure what it was people liked about that show. She’s clearly an It girl but damn that show was not good on any level.
YooHoo to the Rescue,I wish I got famous so I could whine about it
Familie Braun,Morty Seinfeld was a great one. Frank Costanza was an even better one.
Familie Braun,Meg in family guy
Familie Braun,"Not sure if this counts because the pilot episode with them never actually aired, but Alyson Hannigan replacing Riff Reagan as Willow in Buffy. 

Reagan's performance wasn't bad or anything, she just didn't really stand out like Hannigan did. 

Here's the unaired pilot with Reagan if you're interested: https://youtu.be/WR3J-v7QXXw"
Familie Braun,"At first I was bummed when Psych recast young Shawn because I thought Liam James was great and would have liked to continue watching him grow. But since the writers seemingly wanted the flashbacks to focus on Shawn at a certain age that Liam was aging out of, recasting made sense and Skyler Gisondo actually ended up being a pretty good replacement, but I wouldn’t call one better than the other."
Familie Braun,"The pilot episode of 30 Rock had Rachel Dratch in the Jenna role, and while she's very funny, it was hard to take her seriously as a sex symbol for Alec Baldwin's Jack. She's clearly talented, but Jenna became a better character with Jane Krakowski being a much more believable dimwitted party machine than the more cerebral Dratch."
Familie Braun,"The Doctor from Doctor Who.  

It was such a good recasting that they've made recasting the role from time to time canon to the show.  Recasting The Doctor is crucial to the show's longevity."
Familie Braun,William Shatner in star trek as the captain.
Familie Braun,Alan Alda as Hawkeye Pierce
Familie Braun,Both of the Beckys in Roseanne were great.
Familie Braun,Reggie in Riverdale
Familie Braun,"I don't know if unaired pilots count, but Sookie and Dean on Gilmore girls. I really like Alex Borstein, but she wasn't suited for sweet lovable Sookie. She is better suited for playing tougher characters. Something just felt off and there wasn't the same friendship chemistry with Lauren Graham. 

The Dean scenes were also so awkward. I sadly can't find the whole.pilot or Dean scene on YouTube. I watched it years ago, when it was still online, but they still have a Sookie scene online.

https://youtu.be/jlrUdpyl7BM"
Familie Braun,the first frederick in frasier was recast with trevor einhorn in all subsequent appearances. maybe not the best recast but it made those once-a-season freddy episodes more palatable
Familie Braun,"**Greg from Crazy Ex-Girlfriend** \- both were wonderful (I mourned not getting a reprise from the amazingly talented Santino Fontana) but I really enjoyed how the writers cleverly worked the recast into the show's story in a way that makes sense and feels like it was intentional from season 1. [Vox even wrote an article about its success lol.](https://www.vox.com/culture/2018/12/12/18136420/crazy-ex-girlfriend-season-4-episode-8-im-not-the-person-i-used-to-be-recap-greg-recast)

As for a character I *wish* had been recast - Lee Scoresby of His Dark Materials, played by Lin-Manuel Miranda. But I don't know how they could have successfully recast him after season 1."
Familie Braun,Sparatacus. It was under unfortunate circumstances but I thought Liam McIntyre did a good job replacing Andy Whitfield.
Familie Braun,Daario Naharis in Game of Thrones
Familie Braun,Becky – Roseanne
Familie Braun,"Vivian Banks, it was a jarring change, but the new Viv seemed so much warmer and more motherly."
Familie Braun,Upcoming Geralt Witcher recasting.
Familie Braun,[deleted]
Familie Braun,What about Lloyd Braun!
Familie Braun,Which time?
Familie Braun,"Yeah, I remember watching the unaired pilot years ago and thinking BTVS probably wouldn't have been as successful without Alyson Hannigan, because she had great chemistry with both SMG and Nicholas Brendon.  They felt like a real trio of friends, not actors shoved together."
Familie Braun,"Feels unfair judging just by the pilot, it's possible she would have grown into the role and had a much bigger career as a result if given a chance."
Familie Braun,"I like both in isolation, but felt the original was more like Shawn would be as a child. He was a trouble maker where Gisondo's rendition seemed much more wholesome and likeable."
Familie Braun,That never aired did it?
Familie Braun,[deleted]
Familie Braun,"Kate Mulgrew in Star Trek as the captain

Also doesn’t count, but Patrick Bauchau was Gene Roddenberry’s favorite for Picard because Patrick Stewart wasn’t Kirk-like enough. He got overruled"
Familie Braun,What was he b4? Or who was captain b4 him
Familie Braun,The alt universe callback in the Rivervale episodes was *amazeballs*
Familie Braun,Here it is: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfH7luCd--w
Familie Braun,[deleted]
Familie Braun,... what?
Familie Braun,"I don't believe so. An old roommate was an editor & writer at USAToday back then and received DVDs of the various pilots before the season. We got the Black Donnellys, Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip, 30 Rock, a few others. It was fun how the two shows about sketch comedy shows compared to each other - Studio 60 looked good, came out of the gate throwing 100mph but the character development was very strained. Great dialogue but the various characters were just TOO Sorkin, too quickly. It was hard to care about any of them.

30 Rock was very funny from the jump, but both sketch show pilots were trying to show how deeply awesome their female leads in their shows' universes. Sarah Paulson's Harriet Hayes was supposed to be this massively talented mega star, but all her sketches were flat and she didn't seem to be having fun. Likewise, Rachel Dratch's Jenna was supposed to be this party girl, half-drunk or high every scene, possibly hungover and ready to get laid... and it just didn't seem right."
Familie Braun,There's a piece of it [here](https://youtu.be/3Mh18eE4enM).
Familie Braun,"Yeah, I would believe that to a degree. Having seen both the original pilot with Dratch and then S1, E1 with Krakowski, it was basically a shot-for-shot do over. My old roommate and I commented on it at the time - great idea, great cast, love Tina Fey, Alec Baldwin, Jack McBreyer,  and we both said ""Is Dratch a realistic party girl?” I think she even suggested reversing Fey and Dratch's parts, thinking Rachel would be more suited for Liz Lemon and Tina being more of the sex symbol. 

Based on the original pilot, 30 Rock might have gotten a season or 2, resigned to the ""Brilliant but Cancelled"" realm of television."
Familie Braun,"Billy Campbell, who played Okona, was the last runner up with Jonathan Frakes for Riker."
Familie Braun,Jeffery Hunter who played captain [Pike was captain in the pilot before they put shatner in](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Pike_\(Star_Trek\))
Familie Braun,"Thank you I was looking for that scene.  Works better with Jared so awkward with the different Dean. I remember the whole thing used to be online, but maybe it's still somewhere on the internet."
Familie Braun,"First guy was perfect for the character, his presence alone brought excitement and uncertainty. The second guy was just a male romantic interest."
Familie Braun,"I agree. He was a bit goofy but the recast version was kind of bland and forgettable. I still wish they went with more of a [book accurate](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Daario_Naharis) version with the blue beard, gold mustache, and fancy clothes. Game of Thrones had a tendency to tone down some of the books' quirkier elements."
Familie Braun,"Wow, yeah that would not have worked.  Different actress for Cerie as well."
Familie Braun,"I always thought they shifted the character heavily when they recast her, I didnt realize she was still basically the same because yeah Dratch is incredibly miscast for that role. Also shes just not good in the clips here."
Familie Braun,The Rikerteer?
Familie Braun,"Oh interesting, never knew that"
Familie Braun,"Jeffrey Hunter was good, but man do I love Anson Mount."
Familie Braun,"To be fair, a lot of the books quirky stuff could have looked really stupid on TV."
Familie Braun,"That's the thing - it's not like it just looks weird after having years of experience seeing Krakowski in the role; it didn't work from the first viewing of the pilot, weeks before they announced the recasting."
After Life,"""What's wrong?! Too challenging for you?!"""
After Life,The dog... The dead wife... The swearing... brilliant!
After Life,Nothing IS off limits. You just have to be funny and tell the joke well. And if you fail at doing that then just accept that maybe you failed.
After Life,"I would have liked this show more if not for Ricky's insistence on facing off against some ridiculously transparent strawman representative of whatever concept he's mad about that day, verbally running circles around them with his vastly superior intellect until he reaches his big ""gotcha!"" punchline. It feels like the most laughably contrived dick stroking."
After Life,I’ll keep my Derick and my Idiot abroad and he can have his After Life.  It’s not terrible I just am not really into it for whatever reason. Probably bc I just don’t find it very funny and not because of the subject matter.
After Life,"My mum lost her partner and mother within a month of each other two years ago. 

This show has helped her so much, I don't think she'll ever be ok again but I support her always. 

I wish there was a way to thank mr gervais, this show has been so helpful."
After Life,God this is so tiring. There are no topics in comedy that are off limits; the Comedy Police will not arrest you for making a joke at the expense of black or trans people but that doesn't mean everybody should have to pretend they enjoy it. Vocally disliking something is not the same thing as censorship and I'm tired of pretentious comedians pretending it is.
After Life,No topic is off limits but not every joke is funny either. A concept comedians and people with frail egos fail to grasp.
After Life,Not one person in these comments that is outraged read the article. It has nothing to do with “cancel culture”. It is about seeing that the audience can see humor in all kinds of not funny topics that are morose like dying of cancer or suicide (what this program deals with). I get the Rickey rage as well as the BS about sanctimonious comedians complaining about cancel culture but this article has little to do with the headline.
After Life,"[I love you dad…. gay.](https://youtu.be/x3vQxXqZj40)

One of the best scenes in the series. Helps shine a light on Alzheimer’s. Both funny, sad, and heartwarming. This show is great. It helps us swallow some of the hard facts of life with a spoon full of sugar."
After Life,"I’ve watched season one at the behest of my girlfriend, and I do get it. As someone who went through that entire gamut of emotions losing  someone who was my entire world nearly 6 years ago I can absolutely relate. I didn’t give a fuck about anything. Including my own self. From the perspective of someone who’s been there it’s not very entertaining - it’s a window. The show does an excellent job of capturing his despair. I’m not particularly a fan of his but he does a marvelous job. I was impermeable in every sense of the word until the day I lost her.

5 years of that were spent in purgatory. 2 months  after she was gone I landed my dream job, and hated it.  I worked my ass off for those ensuing 5 years but I hated every second of it.  That job like almost everything in my life was a constant reminder of her and I couldn’t take it. I threw everything away. I just didn’t care, and I made zero effort to try to replace her. The very thought made me sick. I could never replace her.  There were a couple of stand ins - not gonna lie, but I tried to be as respectful as I could be and never lied about the way things were. Nobody was getting in. Don’t waste your efforts and just let this be whatever it is for as long as it shall last. 

And then I met her. Truth be told I was a bit of an asshole to her at first. She didn’t deserve it. She was simply way too beautiful, she hit way too close to home and I just didn’t trust her. It was an online interaction 100% initiated by her and I really thought she was some kind of cam girl at first yanking my chain, but boy was I wrong. This woman turned out to be everything I ever wanted rolled up into an abundance of patience who somehow saw value in me and helped me get over the hump of my immeasurable grief. I think she herself was looking for someone  who could relate to herself and her own life, but that is neither here nor there. 

16 months later we have an unbreakable bond. I love my ex and I always will, but it is okay to move on. I am grateful for a second chance with someone I don’t believe I deserve, but I am taking it. No one else could have gotten to me the way that she did. No one else could have exceeded the impossible metrics my mind had set for anyone else foolish enough to try and tame me.  I am beyond blessed. I’d be lost without her.

Edit: a word"
After Life,Interesting to read all the comments that dislike him here yet Netflix keeps renewing it and the article suggests it’s a success. I guess Reddit doesn’t like him?
After Life,Man says own show proves his point.
After Life,[deleted]
After Life,It’s honestly really well done
After Life,"To me, After Life has felt like the most genuine relatable depiction of loss and depression."
After Life,"Good god, Reddit is an echo chamber."
After Life,"To remind all the Carlin-quoters who will say Carlin disagrees with this sort of shit because they listened to his most famous standup bit for 15min -- look up Carlin's, ""rape can be funny,"" bit. You don't even need to find it funny to understand his philosophical and political leanings.

And to explain to all the already-offended, Carlin is not saying rape is funny. He's saying by virtue of the medium of stand-up comedy, nothing should be off-limits, and increasingly horrific topics should be viewed as increasingly challenging obstacles that can be overcome by a sufficiently skilled comedian. He is literally espousing Chappelle and Gervais' views, in no small part because he was probably a gigantic influence on them."
After Life,"I think the is seriously one of the best shows on Netflix. Hilarious, and extremely touching."
After Life,"I don’t understand how an otherwise smart guy can be so dumb.

You can do jokes about racism.

people just don’t like racist jokes.

see the difference?

I mean, you’ve hosted the golden globes five times and multiple TV shows, Hollywood isn’t silencing you,"
After Life,"No topic is ""off limits"". Some people just aren't fucking funny when they joke about some things and should fuck off so someone who actually is can be."
After Life,That shows is more like a drama than a comedy. There are jokes here and there but the show feels sooo real. I really love the characters but I rarely “laugh”
After Life,I was looking for somewhere to let my feelings of grief out and what to do with the wall of energy behind them and After Life helped me.
After Life,Season 3 was pretty disappointing. Try harder.
After Life,"I live with a broken heart after the deaths of my two sons. This show speaks to my grief. It encourages one to not submit to the sorrow. I, too, wished for contentment rather than happiness or joy. Most days I carry on but it is always there, like your shadow in the sun."
After Life,"Oh, a thread where lots of Redditors tell a professional comedian why he’s wrong and doesn’t understand comedy like they do. Let’s see how it plays out. Cue the Wonka meme."
After Life,[deleted]
After Life,This is so exhausting. And his point would be much stronger if the After Life script was half decent rather than every character just immediately blurting out exactly what they’re thinking all of the time. Subtlety has never been a strength of Gervais when Merchant’s not around.
After Life,"Gervais walks the thin line of criticizing and being an asshole very precariously. There's a lot of humanity in his earlier work (probably up to and including Life's too short) but his later tours are mundane, boring cries of a rich white guy, whining about not being able to say this and that, while shouting that exact thing to the whole world from incredibly lucrative platforms. The usual stuff.

His work went downhill after he stopped working with Stephen Merchant, as u/chadisdangerous reminded me of below"
After Life,I was not a fan of Ricky but I watched this show and I now love him!!!!
After Life,"The banter in the show is very fun but in general his character does not change at all, snarky and in ""grief"" for 3 seasons now... So what's the point of the show with no progression?"
After Life,Love this show.  It's just a simple little premise and totally enjoyable.  Short and sweet gets the job done.
After Life,"The Hogan's Heroes spin-off didn't do so well, being set in a concentration camp instead of a POW camp."
After Life,Struggling with season 1. Hella depressing
After Life,This show is brilliant. Hits all the right places.
After Life,Last season made me cry
After Life,I loved all 3 seasons. I didn’t really see it as a comedy show but more of a way to show another way that people grieve. There isn’t just1 way and it isn’t nice and tidy.
After Life,He is starting resemble a real life and less likeable version of his character David Brent. Oh and did you know that he is an athiest?
After Life,But not everyone is as eloquent as Mr. Gervais & some  goofy blonde youtuber is going to dumb everyone down flying these tenets of comedy.
After Life,I sort of enjoyed After life season 1&2 but the third season so far (seen 2 episodes) has been weaker. Never on the lever of Office or Extras though.
After Life,“Proving no topic is off limits” seems to be all comedians care about once they’re popular.
After Life,Can they stop confirming after every sentence? “…isn’t it?…does it?
After Life,"The “good, I hope that was his cock, you stupid cunt” line had me in tears"
After Life,A comedy set in a concentration camp would be far more controversial than After Life
After Life,"Everything should be off limits for Ricky Gervais, that guy is about as funny as a woman giving birth to a stillborn fetus"
After Life,It's such a dark and deep topic and the humor is so British! It's just brilliantly written and almost everyone has done justice to the characters they've played.
After Life,"Two simple rules for comedy:

1. Don't punch down
2. Your joke has to be funnier than it is offensive. If you want to say something very offensive, you joke damn well better be extremely funny"
After Life,"Does the show progress at all in S3? I've just watched the first episode today and it seems it's been stuck in limbo since first episode ""My wife is dead and I can't get over it so I'm a dick to every person in my live even though they just want the best for me and try to be nice"" is pretty much all the show is about."
After Life,"No topic in comedy should be off limits---but it still has to be good. A lot of ""edgy comedy"" is just saying taboo thing with no jokes or anything."
After Life,His roast at the Emmys is still one of the greatest 15 minutes of comedy in history. Holy shit.
After Life,"What is he talking about? After Life wasn't exactly edgy, or groundbreaking comedy. A lot of people found it to be good, but no one is describing it as edgy."
After Life,"Calling ""Afterlife"" a comedy is a bit of a stretch, especially the last season. It's more of a soppy drama with some comedy sprinkled in it."
After Life,"No topic is off-limits.  What people whining about ""political correctness"" don't understand is that using your platform to attack vulnerable groups is not even comedy; it's just hate.

Any topics can be funny, but assholes are just assholes."
After Life,"I know he’s talking about Dave Chapelle and other controversial comedians, but the difference is that with someone like Dave Chapelle, his jokes about trans people weren’t funny to the trans community and came across more like he was attacking them. Trans people joke about being trans all the time (Hell, there’s like two or three whole subs dedicated to trans people shitposting), so if he had just listened to more than one trans person he would have had great material that the trans community could laugh along with. Instead he just pulled the equivalent of the ‘Well I have a black friend so I can’t be racist!’

I agree that no topic shouldn’t be allowed to be joked about, but jokes can sometimes hurt people if they’re done in bad faith."
After Life,"Never seen it, don’t disagree with the idea that comedy should tackle complex and controversial issues… however…

That’s a stupid argument. “It made money, so therefore it’s inherently good!”… someone should inform him of how profitable the slave trade was."
After Life,"I just binged the 3rd season. Comedy???
Uh, no. I think I laughed once watching the entire season. I must have cried 3 or 4 times though. Great show!"
After Life,"Really Ricky? Again? You've done this exact same interview every other week for years now. 

Doesn't it get exhausting playing the victim all the time?"
After Life,Nothing is off limits as long as it is approached with a sensitive take rather than the belligerent take some comedians think are okay. The reason why After Life is so good is the beautiful way Gervais looks at life after the passing of someone so loved.
After Life,I feel like Ricky Gervais would have this same “nothing is off limits” takeaway from anything though. It’s kind of his whole deal.
After Life,So we're finally going to rise up against kids with cancer?
After Life,Did you see his movie where’s he’s a dentist and can see the dead? It was hysterical! Is this based on the same premise?
After Life,I mean it's barely a comedy..
After Life,I love this show and him in it. Really humanises the feeling of loss and dispare and doesn't make it all the grass is greener on the other side. I relate so much to how he treats the world and hates everything after losing a loved one.
After Life,"How does he extrapolate from ‘I successfully created a funny series about grief’ to ‘No topic can ever be out of bounds?’

Lazy thinking. 

I enjoy After Life. Nonetheless I recommend Ricky doesn’t attempt a hilarious comedy based in Auschwitz"
After Life,"So talk about billionaire cartels and how big media is all owned by one conglomerate or how propaganda for illegal wars is constant. Do Carlin or bill hicks controversies rather than just punching down constantly you smug, rich, fuck."
After Life,"I don't know why it's so difficult for comedians like Gervais to grasp that it's not the TOPIC that's a problem, it's the shitty cruelty. There are plenty of hilarious things to say about every brand of minority that don't involve shitting all over them and violating their dignity."
After Life,Never found this guy funny in the least.
After Life,"I’ve seen one season of After Life.

Was it supposed to be comedy? I don’t get it."
After Life,All it took for ‘after life’ to be successful was for everyone in the whole world to be quarantined and watching TV for two years.
After Life,"No *topic* should be off limits, but it does matter how you talk about those topics. Basically, this doesn't mean you can't still be an asshole Ricky."
After Life,"easy win with something like death. Let's try again with race, sexual orientation, cancel culture, religion, pedo priests Rick"
After Life,This guy gets free reign to make whatever show he pleases and make a shitload of money doing it but he cannot fucking let go of this one thing. So childish.
After Life,[deleted]
After Life,"Comedians who confuse ""This is shit, and ""humor"" built on the backs of stgereotypes and diminishing people"" with ""a topic is off limits"".

I agree with ""no topic should be off limits"". I also believe that about 90% times when this true statement is used, it's a strawman to respond to criticism of specific content rather than claiming something ENTIRELY off limits. For any ""I got canceled, this topic shouldn't be off limits"" there are ample examples of comedy touching those topics that prove that they are NOT by any means off limits in the first place.

There is a difference between ""I should be able to make ANY joke on ANY topic the way I see fit without criticism over it"" and ""this topic should not be off limits""."
After Life,"As an atheist, ha ha funny movie. Still not an excuse to make transphobic/homophobic/racist jokes. He should be a good enough comedian to make jokes about literally anything else"
After Life,"The series is trash. I've seen it because I like Ricky but it is wasn't worth the time.

The story is going nowhere. You are supposed to watch his character crying over a dead wife over and over in every episode without any reward in the end. 

It felt like a lazy written and extra whiny version of Louie."
After Life,If he bothers you turn him off . Just like me with Don Lemon
After Life,"No topic should be off-limits anywhere, not just in comedy."
After Life,"Season one good. Two, just bearable. Three... couldn’t make it past two episodes. 

It’s more of the same. Gervais’ thoughts written down in script form and read out by third rate actors. Would have saved himself time and effort by doing a podcast."
After Life,[removed]
After Life,I gotta be honest I don't think I laughed during this show once. I usually like Ricky but something about the show made it seem like it exists for him to complain about life
After Life,"frankly , I like his style of ""fuck everyone and everything"" comedy , if only he stopped making these edgy teenager statements"
After Life,Shark Party!
After Life,What a legend.
After Life,Ricky Gervais should consider identifying as funny.
After Life,"After Life is utterly shit. Its like one of those adverts for kids with cleft palates with sad music over the top but instead of asking for money someone says the word ""cunt""

Yeah,  it's emotional but it's not in the slightest bit funny. The most offensive thing about it is calling it a comedy"
After Life,"A fat, late middle aged white guy lost his wife and it made him sad but we made jokes.  Therefore, you can make jokes out of anything.

 \-  Ricky Gervais"
After Life,"I wouldn't even call after life a comedy. It's not particularly funny, and I don't think it's trying to be. I honestly can't stand Gervais as a comedian. He gets off on being an asshole, he punches down, and he's just insufferable. On the other hand, he has written some of the sweetest most touching dramedies with After Life, Derek, even Extras which is a comedy, but has a lot of human moments, and in which his character is generally not rewarded for being a jerk.

He's a complicated man I guess. After Life is a beautiful show, but it's not a comedy. 

He is right in that no topic is off limits in comedy, but that doesn't mean you just say anything you want. Comedy still demands that you be clever, to find a way to explore any topic, but to do it in a way that doesn't hurt people. The ability to take a 'taboo' topic, and make it funny, and not punch down, is the sign of a clever comedian."
After Life,[deleted]
After Life,Anyone else feel like the cinematography in the third season is super weird?
After Life,"Seriously weird comments about Gervais. I guess goes to show nowadays there is a reason there is no universal agreement on anything. 

Gervais is easily one of the best comedians to do standup in the last 20 years and the fact he just gave it a shot is testimony to how good he is. 

And I for one absolutely support him in his discussions and pushback , cancel culture and how people interpret offense"
After Life,"Wow, Ricky Gervais saying how edgy he is again? That's new."
After Life,Not this again. Come on Ricky
After Life,jesus fuck Ricky - get rid of the therapist - he's useless (doesn't forward the story any) just a crude asshole that never helps - why would any person see this guy a second time?
After Life,"Comedians are the wettest and most thin-skinned people in the entire entertainment business, and in that crowded field, Ricky manages to be one of the wettest of them all."
After Life,"Why is this article formatted like a bunch of text messages?? Anyway, interested to check out the show and I have to agree with what he's saying about comedy in general."
After Life,"The first two seasons were a breath of fresh air and so very sweet, this last one so very forced and so unlike the ease and excellence before it."
After Life,"Not sure if that's the proof for it, but the statement is true 🤷‍♂️"
After Life,"While I don’t find him funny, I do agree. It should be about intent instead of topic."
After Life,Loo at the mad people here. Yes there is no comedy police but that doesn't mean a lot of people aren't trying to censor.  Also in doen countries the law is the comedy police.
Formula 1: Drive to Survive,"Season 1 was great as it served as an introduction to the sport for new fans. Season 2 and 3 were alright as they had some really great moments and had a lot of content that you wouldnt see from just watching the racing.

Season 4 was just ass. It was at best a retelling of just what happened, and at worst they invented things that never happened."
Formula 1: Drive to Survive,I just watch it for Steiner moments now.
Formula 1: Drive to Survive,I can’t believe they ended up making a real-life competition based on the one in this show.
Formula 1: Drive to Survive,"Meh… I’m honestly kinda done because of the countless fake narratives. 

Not for me i guess.."
Formula 1: Drive to Survive,"I wonder what kind of concessions they had to make for Verstappen to get back in the chair.  
If I recall, he skipped last season because of all the false drama they put into the show."
Formula 1: Drive to Survive,Finally
Formula 1: Drive to Survive,>!Personally I felt like last season was kind of boring. Max clearly had the best car out there and it wasn't nearly as interesting as the year before. Ferrari should've been right there with Red Bull but Ferrari was nothing short of a laughing disaster. They found some way to fuck up almost every race after the first quarter of the season.!<
Formula 1: Drive to Survive,"Lost interest during last season, it started to feel too dramatized and phoney, if that makes sense... I don't know, began to throw off too many soap opera'y vibes and that really made me fall off quick."
Formula 1: Drive to Survive,"Ehhh don't care, I'm more interested in getting the 2023 season going!"
Formula 1: Drive to Survive,"i give negative shits about f1, but this show is so well done even though i know its almost entirely manufactured bs"
Formula 1: Drive to Survive,"I’m so glad Binotto is gone… If a team principal for Ferrari can’t even take the effort to do the interviews in english, while he is working in an environment where everybody communicate in english that is sad and unacceptable for me!! Same on him! This attitude is the reason why they didn’t anything in the past decade"
Formula 1: Drive to Survive,"> It was at best a retelling of just what happened

All of them were for the most part.

When you realise you've already seen everything already, then that's when you stop watching because you're already paying attention to F1 and thus are no longer the target audience."
Formula 1: Drive to Survive,What you didn't like the episode of Mazepins brilliance of him knowing when Russian Clouds will rain on the track only to beat two DNF drivers?
Formula 1: Drive to Survive,one might say they should stop inventing
Formula 1: Drive to Survive,Mate you should see how they actually made the game from Queen's Gambit a worldwide sport...unreal
Formula 1: Drive to Survive,"And the fact they do not cover any of the actual drama and politics that exists in the sport is the thing that drove me away.

Things like Ferrari's 2019 fuel flow controversy, bad decisions by stewards or race director and much more. But then every episode there's a teammate that is out to bury his teammate and they'll add the longest of pauses to a crash when in reality the driver speaks on the radio immediately.

I gave the show 2 chances and never bothered to waste more time with the following seasons.

I bet this season won't even mention the missile attack in Saudi Arabia and how the race was almost boycotted by the drivers.

But hey, in the end it worked for FOM as I know several people that don't watch sports, at all, but ""stan"" certain drivers because of the show and how easy they look on the eye.

One day I might watch that mythical episode where they build up Mazepin for knowing russian clouds, when in reality he was dead last and unlaped himself because a couple of cars ahead had retired and he still finished last and two laps down. Must be top meme material."
Formula 1: Drive to Survive,"Yeah it’s gotten pretty obnoxious lately. I remember feeling the same way when I used to watch Top Gear. At first the clearly scripted but pretending to be spontaneous shots were funny, but then they started going over the top with it and it became much less so."
Formula 1: Drive to Survive,"First two seasons were ok, but they really dialed it to 11 after that and I stopped watching."
Formula 1: Drive to Survive,What was the fake narratives here~~? ~~
Formula 1: Drive to Survive,"He was upset after the first season because he thought it created fake drama, especially between him and Riccardio who are good friends. Apparently a lot of drivers weren’t happy and they all had a sit down with Netflix and the producers who promised to tone done the fabricated stuff."
Formula 1: Drive to Survive,"Yeah, it's not a recap, it's an introduction for new fans. That's why it releases right before the following season instead of releasing as soon as the current season ends."
Formula 1: Drive to Survive,You know OP is from a monarchy by using ‘mate‘
Formula 1: Drive to Survive,It's funny because people get so mad at pro wrestling fans because it's fake but sports like MMA and F1 have had a massive upturn in popularity thanks to the insertion of fake storylines and manipulative editing.
Formula 1: Drive to Survive,"I think they're more guilty of dramatic embellishment than truly ""fake"" narratives.  The ""Man on Fire"" episode in Season 3 is one example: they took an event that lasted for 2.5 minutes and turned it into a 10-minute ordeal with a dramatic reveal at the end. It wasn't *fake* strictly speaking, but it was very embellished for dramatic effect"
Formula 1: Drive to Survive,[deleted]
Formula 1: Drive to Survive,"Well tbf as far as I know they're a fairly small team so it gives them a good bit of time to edit things and try to make it high quality too. 

But yes, it's essentially promo to get casuals into F1 when hype is building for the new season."
Formula 1: Drive to Survive,"I think it would've been more interesting if, instead they took the Hard Knocks route that HBO takes with the NFL.  But hey, can't fault them.  The show is a big hit so clearly they know what they're doing."
Formula 1: Drive to Survive,"The difference is that the competition in F1 and MMA are real. You can fake beef as much as you want, the result is still real."
Formula 1: Drive to Survive,"They do also fake naratives. The Mclaren episode from season 3 is the biggest one that comes to mind. Trying to make out Carlos Sainz and Lando Norris were firece rivals, when literally every F1 fan knows that they were really good friends."
Formula 1: Drive to Survive,Sounds like f1 to me.
Formula 1: Drive to Survive,"""No Michael, noooo."" This season gonna be spicy."
Formula 1: Drive to Survive,Yes Michael yes this is so right
Formula 1: Drive to Survive,"Do yourself a favor and just watch the races of the 2021 season, it was one of the best seasons in decades.

DtS is great for bringing in new viewership for F1, but:

a. They stage and shamelessly make up incidents and conflicts that simply did not exist, most egregiously by editing in fake audio

b. They focus on lowest-common-denominator petty drama, while completely ignoring genuinely compelling high stakes competition, rivalries, emotions, etc."
Formula 1: Drive to Survive,I hope there's some good meme potential in there.
Formula 1: Drive to Survive,Having watched the whole season live - there will be tons of material for this year.   First time theres been a real championship battle in any DTS season.    I hope all the DTS fans really enjoy this season! I wish i could wipe my memories of this season just to watch this blind again
Formula 1: Drive to Survive,"Love this, I've watched every season. I advise not going to the formula1 sub for discussion though. They despise it, some of it is warranted but the toxicity has become unbearable."
Formula 1: Drive to Survive,Fuck Michael Masi.
Formula 1: Drive to Survive,Yeeees
Formula 1: Drive to Survive,"This look boring asf, but for those who love it I'm sure this'll hit hard"
Formula 1: Drive to Survive,Michael. You must reinstate the last season.
Formula 1: Drive to Survive,"Or maybe just watch Drive to Survive for what it is? I follow all of the races, but can still enjoy DTS. Its not hard to just laugh at the made up stuff, but enjoy the behind the scenes looks at stuff that happened throughout the season. People act like if you watch DTS you have to take everything at face value."
Formula 1: Drive to Survive,Aren't the races several hours long? That's a bit much for me.
Formula 1: Drive to Survive,"DTS brought me into the sport and i've been watching races since s1. Every other year you kind of had to search for interesting battles to watch during most races, as the hierarchy was pretty solidified before. 

But 2021 was special. I'd never been more engrossed into a sport season than I was last year. As an American i would describe 2021 like watching 20 Super Bowls in a single season."
Formula 1: Drive to Survive,"Never seen this, but doesn’t that describe most documentaries though? Creating stories through editing where one didn’t really exist seems par for the course."
Formula 1: Drive to Survive,Yeah you can even see in the trailer they’re trying to push “beef” between Lando and Carlos aswell as Lando and Dani Ric
Formula 1: Drive to Survive,"While I'm sure watching race to race as the season unfolds is the absolute best (and only) way to really appreciate the sport, I personally just can't get in to it.

But I love watching Drive to Survive even if they include some unnecessary dramatic bullshit."
Formula 1: Drive to Survive,"Where have they edited in fake audio?

Some of the things they ignore, they do so because teams refuse to participate in the series. There’s not much to be done about that. Of course they’re going to play up certain dramatic angles. Literally every sports program does that, even pregame shows for the NHL or EPL."
Formula 1: Drive to Survive,"worst season iv watched of F1

FU Masi"
Formula 1: Drive to Survive,[deleted]
Formula 1: Drive to Survive,[deleted]
Formula 1: Drive to Survive,Well when a show is trying to create drama between people and teams that isn't even there it is quite annoying
Formula 1: Drive to Survive,[deleted]
Formula 1: Drive to Survive,[deleted]
Formula 1: Drive to Survive,"Careful, Christian Horner will call you a bully"
Formula 1: Drive to Survive,"I’m good, but you go on right ahead, just do it behind closed doors 

(I kid of course, not a great race director at all)"
Formula 1: Drive to Survive,"Yeah, and there’s no way I would have gotten into F1 without DTS. Jumping straight into races would have been too overwhelming + it’s hard to choose who to root for if you barely see the actual racers."
Formula 1: Drive to Survive,It's different since you already watch F1. A lot of people who are new don't know what's real and what's made up. There lies the problem.
Formula 1: Drive to Survive,[deleted]
Formula 1: Drive to Survive,"I'm not sure if they're made public outside of the F1TV channel/app, but they do a 'Race in 30' for each race, condensing the good bits down into 30 minutes. It's the next best thing IMO, if you can find access to them. Otherwise you might have to sign up for a free trial to F1TV and try to watch them all before it expires. 

As a big F1 fan I just pay the annual fee, as $100/year feels like a bargain for a sport that goes on for nearly 8 months of the year. Compared to like $300 for ~4 months of NFL Sunday Ticket."
Formula 1: Drive to Survive,"Assuming normal weather and no red flags, typically under 2 hours and it's commercial free on one of the ESPNs in the US."
Formula 1: Drive to Survive,"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GtWWlMSLLDk

5 seconds search on youtube"
Formula 1: Drive to Survive,"Hard to tell, since the new budget rules are only in effect from this season onwards."
Formula 1: Drive to Survive,"Recently there has been a wave of constructors talking about getting into F1; Andretti, Panthera, Stefan, Porsche, Audi... and I have a feeling a big reason why is the new budget caps.

Andretti seems to be the closest and best equipped to join. F1 is very anxious to get a true American team in there because of how much it would grow the market, but there's so much politics involved its hard to say what will happen."
Formula 1: Drive to Survive,"I could care less about cars and racing, but I watched every F1 race the past two seasons because this show is what got me initially interested and invested in this sport."
Formula 1: Drive to Survive,"Sure, that's why I said some of it is warranted. But when people start to nitpick every little thing, it becomes a toxic echo chamber of negativity. Completely ruins the enjoyment."
Formula 1: Drive to Survive,"> They are incredibly inclusive   
  
i feel like inclusive isnt the word you meant here... maybe insular?"
Formula 1: Drive to Survive,formuladank is great if you don't ever go to the comments on a post about Lewis or Max
Formula 1: Drive to Survive,"I don't know about now, but formuladank was horrible during the recent season, it went from being a funny subreddit of memes to an avalance of Hamilton hate and Verstappen circlejerking."
Formula 1: Drive to Survive,I fucking love how slimy Christian Horner is.
Formula 1: Drive to Survive,"same here. and recommending people watch 40+ hours of races instead of a short netflix series is just insane. I love F1 now and am going to my first GP this year, but the way some f1 fans try to trample on peoples fun is very weird  
  
DTS is great for what is it - entertainment"
Formula 1: Drive to Survive,The brevity of the races is a big plus for me
Formula 1: Drive to Survive,The F1 youtube channel is pretty great for catching up on highlights. They usually have the FP/Qual/race highlights posted within a few hours in 5-10 minute videos.
Formula 1: Drive to Survive,It’s wonderful that it took you that long to find it. I’m sorry that I had things going on and asked you a question looking for an answer to a thing you asserted. 🤦🏻‍♂️
Formula 1: Drive to Survive,It's all warranted lol im sure if there was something you were a huge fan of and then there was a show made about it that misrepresented everything about the thing you like then you would also be mad about it
Formula 1: Drive to Survive,"Yeah compared to something like Daytona500 which goes 3-4 hours, i love F1's ~90 minute race time. Just dont give me another Spa 2021."
Formula 1: Drive to Survive,"Yeah they will release like 6-7 minute highlight videos, but I checked and 'race in 30' is exclusive to F1TV sadly.

Highlights cant do a race justice because so much of the drama is the tension leading up to a track battle. It's hard for someone new to the sport to appreciate, similar to trying to convince someone new to watching soccer how a 1-0 match can be entertaining start to finish."
Formula 1: Drive to Survive,"I'm a huge fan of F1.

There's currently a post in the sub nitpicking a mirrored image from the trailer and getting angry lol. I mean, if you enjoy that kind of negativity, okay."
Formula 1: Drive to Survive,"Ohh! I am pretty sure you are one those halo haters and ""Bring back the V12 "" guys."
Formula 1: Drive to Survive,"I don't have F1TV, so I have to rely on the YT highlights when I miss a race. It's pretty great content for being free IMO.

But agreed on your general point"
Formula 1: Drive to Survive,"I mean they made it seem like Ricci ardi and max hated each other, they’re the best of friends.

Having said that drive to survive is a decent watch"
Formula 1: Drive to Survive,"You aren't very smart are you lol quite sad you are saying i am a person that hates things that save peoples lives

I hope you become a better person one day but it is obvious that today isn't that day"
Formula 1: Drive to Survive,"The audio of David Croft and Martin Brundle is taken from Sky Sports’ live coverage, but isn’t necessarily used with the correct footage. The audio of Alex Jaques and Alex Brundle is taken from the F1TV pit lane channel coverage of the race or may be recorded for the show to make sense of the condensed narrative, I don’t know."
Formula 1: Drive to Survive,"Keep in mind each race is hours long, there is so much audio to pull from.  And in many cases, at future races they will recap what happen at a previous race.  Ive not seen any cases where I thought there was faked audio, but I have seen DTS use quotes at different races that when I watched the commentators originally say it."
Formula 1: Drive to Survive,Sometimes they use the real ones but most of the time it's a scripted one.
Formula 1: Drive to Survive,It's definitely fake. And most of the sensational answers given by interviewees are taken from one context and put in another. It's mind numbingly fake that show.
Formula 1: Drive to Survive,"The show is a good enough introduction to the sport for people who don't know about it but want to start watching. I watched the first season as an intro and then haven't gone back to it as I recognized the fakeness of it.

If you're wanting to watch F1 in 2022, watch Season 4 so you know who most of the teams and drivers are but that's about it. But take everything with a container of salt."
Formula 1: Drive to Survive,[deleted]
Formula 1: Drive to Survive,"Bud, chill. OP was simply asking if Netflix was playing it straight or pulling a con. If, as it seems, you don’t know the answer, move on."
Formula 1: Drive to Survive,Is he  trying to be clever with a matrix quote?
Formula 1: Drive to Survive,"Are they just going to name this ""PGA Tour: Drive To Survive""?"
Formula 1: Drive to Survive,Very cool.
Formula 1: Drive to Survive,"I may be wrong, but I don't feel like this will be as interesting..."
Formula 1: Drive to Survive,Ah yeah the daredevils golf players
Formula 1: Drive to Survive,"This ones gotta be amazing! So much happened last season,one of the most dramatic and memorable in recent memory.
Super excited for this"
Formula 1: Drive to Survive,"I’ve never watched an F1 race and everything I know about the sport comes from Rush and Senna, but I binged the first 2 seasons of this show last year and got absolutely hooked, been waiting for this season."
Formula 1: Drive to Survive,Let’s see how many episodes they can milk Grosjean’s crash for.
Formula 1: Drive to Survive,"Do I know they fake teammate drama for the show? Yes  
Do I know we only see small snippets of the races and team radio? Yes  
Will any of this stop me from binging this once it comes out? Absolutely not"
Formula 1: Drive to Survive,"Oh, thank god! I wish there could be more of these. Great way to summarise the season and start the new one. 

Even if you're not a fan of the sport, I'd be surprised if you didn't get hooked."
Formula 1: Drive to Survive,"Can't wait to see the drama of Vettel leaving Ferrari, and Sainz getting the spot over Ricciardo"
Formula 1: Drive to Survive,I'm crying!
Shadow,You played Charlie Cox’s dad in Stardust. Can we extrapolate this data to assume that Billy Russo is the father of Daredevil?
Shadow,Not about Shadow and Bone but I loved you in The Punisher as Russo. If you were given the chance would you return to the MCU? Thanks!
Shadow,Can you please stop dying? I'm traumatized every single time
Shadow,"Hi Ben!

First, you're amazing in concert, I saw your first show in LA and loved it!

Second, I wanted to ask - we've seen Freddy fully embrace the Kazzle Dazzle name. I've seen The Darkling referred to as ""Darkle Sparkle."" I was hoping that you'd see this and the next time you and Freddy post things together, maybe you can refer to yourselves as Kazzle Dazzle and Darkle Sparkle just once?"
Shadow,"Mr. Barnes, can you tell us a happy memory about Narnia?"
Shadow,"Greetings Benjamin, I just want to know the name of The Darkling’s horse—if there’s no official name, I want to know what YOU think it would be. Thx"
Shadow,"Does Leigh Bardugo work closely with the show and if so, how is it working with her? She seems really involved when I check out her Instagram and seems like she has a great relationship with the cast."
Shadow,"I've been in love with you since I watched you in Prince Caspian and Stardust when I was 12 years old. So ummmm will you marry me?

Just kidding. My question is, are you a Neil Gaiman fan? What other books do you enjoy?"
Shadow,What is your favourite type of cheese ? 🧀
Shadow,What comes natural to you.... Playing A Bad Guy or Playing a good guy? And Why?
Shadow,"Do you, as a person, think the Darkling is redeemable?"
Shadow,"I have two for you Ben
1. How would you describe The Darkling’s feelings regarding the women he’s impacted in the series ie Alina, Zoya, Genya, Baghra
2. Have you, at any point in your life, read fanfiction about a certain long haired, convicted murderer that turns into a dog at will and his friend group whilst they were at school?"
Shadow,Could you spoil one of the lines that you managed to sneak in this season? 🤧🤧🤧
Shadow,DROP THE SKINCARE ROUTINE!!
Shadow,How did you and Jessie Mei Li develop such great chemistry?? You guys sizzle on screen and seem like lovely friends off screen!
Shadow,what music/album do you think fits the Darkling and his story?
Shadow,"Hi, now I feel guilty for not watching S&B yet."
Shadow,Hi. Thank you for doing this! Hope you’re having a great week. The Polygon interview just got released so I’m wondering if you can share what your ideal rom com role is?
Shadow,Which order of Grisha do you most align with?
Shadow,"What was your experience like working with Zoe Wanamaker? Did you share a mother-son sort of relationship off cameras (if so, how many times did she hit your leg with her stick) or was the relationship like coworkers."
Shadow,"Hey hi! if the darkling had a signature scent, what would it be?"
Shadow,hello! how different was to play darklina scenes this season rather then the previous one?
Shadow,What is your favourite book in SaB series?
Shadow,which character you wish the darkling had more scenes with?
Shadow,From the six crows which one would you most likely be friends with?
Shadow,What's the scene you're the proudest of?
Shadow,What would be The Darkling’s favorite stuffed animal???
Shadow,"If you could swap characters with your co-cast, who would you want to swap with?"
Shadow,which episode of season 2 would you say is your favorite?
Shadow,Are you working on any new music soon?
Shadow,"I first know about you as Prince Caspian and since then I’ve watched you as Logan in Westworld, Jigsaw in Punisher and Darkling in S&B. 

My question is, which type of characters do you prefer playing? The dark ones or the nice ones?"
Shadow,"If you could have any quote or icon from The Grishaverse tattooed on you, what would it be and why?"
Shadow,"You play fantastic heels in Shadow and Bone and Westworld. Will we see good guy Ben Barnes anytime soon? 

Also your long hair look is #goals for me. Any tips?"
Shadow,Have u ever read the picture of Dorian Gray
Shadow,#RUSSO!!!
Shadow,What was it like being an audiobook narrator for The Lives of Saints and The Demon in the Wood for Leigh Bardugo? Was it a new experience? What was your favorite part?
Shadow,"Hey! Great to have you here! I have following questions:

The darkling looks much older in the show than in the books (even though he is hundreds of years old in the books too). Dont get me wrong, you are a great cast for him! In the books he is as old as Alina, how do you think changes that ""up-ageing"" their relationship? 

And: are the costumes comfortable? Sometimes the keftas look kinda stiff and I am wondering about the scar make up too!

Cant wait seeing you all on screen soon again!"
Shadow,"bin bons???? 

but in all seriousness, your performance as the darkling is truly insane- you bring so much nuance to this character while still making it clear that his actions are just.. awful. i remember growing up watching you play prince caspain too, so i guess my question is, who are your favourite literary heroes and villains? (p.s. i LOVE that you're an anna karenina fan too!)"
Shadow,"Since your have parents come from a fantastic professional mental health background, I wonder how they reacted to your roles of being an absolute psychopath. Did your parents ever recommended you to therapy looking at your immense sense of intrigue towards recently portraying a villain."
Shadow,Not a question but you're great in Cabinet of Curiosities on Netflix.
Shadow,"Hi Ben!! Thank you for taking the time to answer fan questions on here. 

We know that you and Jessie watched Jane Eyre to prepare for the first season :) Did you do anything in particular with Jessie to prepare for Darklina scenes in the second season?"
Shadow,"Hi 🥰
Can you tell us a bit about your experience with narrating audiobooks? Do you have any vocal warm ups you follow and how do you prepare for a day of recording? 

do you ever mess up or are you just (annoyingly) perfect

MUCH LOVE"
Shadow,What was your favorite scene to film as Billy Russo in The Punisher?
Shadow,did any of your s&b castmates fangirl over you the first you met them? haha
Shadow,"Hi Ben!!! 

What would you say a typical filming day looks like for you? Any *rituals* or specifics you do before starting a scene or starting your day overall? 

❤️❤️❤️"
Shadow,"What is the one project you've done that you'd suggest to someone who's never watched your work, that you think summarizes best what you are/represent as an actor? ❤️"
Shadow,"If the show is renewed for season 3, do you think that you would feel comfortable returning as the Darkling (if/when he's killed off, if/when they go the resurrection route) considering that they massacred the S1 development and backstory of the character in favour of making Aleksander the scapegoat for the systemic oppression of the Grisha in S2?

You added a lot of humanity to the character and elevated him from a one-dimensional villain to a fallible human just desperate to save his people from persecution. From the S2 trailer, it seems that they just want to erase all of that work. Whether you step down or not, thank you for all you've done to give the Darkling depth and growth.

PS If they cast for a young Darkling to do any Demon in the Wood flashbacks, might you recommend Louis Partridge? He's perfect for younger you, even if you are ageless and immortal.  


Much love,

a fellow English degree nerd"
Shadow,How do you feel about the way the show handles the Darkling & Alina’s relationship/dynamic in the second season? Super excited to see it!
Shadow,"What was your favorite part about shooting for Season 2? Were there moments from the books that you were craving to do or new characters you were excited to meet? 

Also: you’ve played characters that come from books before; what makes Shadow and Bone stand out as another literary adaptation for you?"
Shadow,"In season 1 there were hints of the Grisha being an oppressed minority and you spoke about it in some interviews, but I have not seen this mentioned so far in any season 2 interview…did season 2 ignore how the Grisha were persecuted for hundreds of years before the Darkling lived???"
Shadow,"As a long-time Shadow and Bone fan its exciting to see the characters come to life on screen, especially the Darkling!

Is there any aspect of the book version of the Darkling that you've primarily kept in mind while acting as him? Thanks!"
Shadow,"Hi Ben, I'm rewatching Season 1 just now and I have to say it's still one of the greatest show on Netflix and your performance is brilliant.

Q: How does it feel to be the villain in Shadow and Bone?

I can't wait to watch Season 2."
Shadow,"Hi Ben! Hope you’re doing well! My question is, what is your favourite thing about playing the Darkling? Is there a particular aspect of his character you find the most interesting or fun to explore? Thanks! 🖤"
Shadow,"Hi Ben, you don't know how excited I am to have you back as The Darkling believe me this wait has seemed like an eternity haha. I know that you will have many questions to answer and I hope you can answer some of the ones that I am going to leave you:  
  
***1.- What was your biggest challenge that you faced in the recording of this second season?***  
***2.- What is your favorite dialogue of this second season?***  
***3.- This is not a question, I just wanted to tell you that if you keep giving shows I really hope you can come to Mexico to give even one show.***  
  
And I don't want to miss the opportunity to tell you how much ***I love you***, in fact you have been with me practically all my life since I met you in Narnia and I hope to have the opportunity to meet you in person very soon, I love you, I love you, I love you and ***I am very proud of you. XOXOXO***"
Shadow,"Which role is the most challenging for you so far, and why?"
Shadow,Whos your favorite shadow and bone cast member to work with?
Shadow,"If you were born in Ketterdam alongside the other crows, what job do you think you would do in the gang?"
Shadow,"Can you tell us your personal favorite episode of season 2? And any hope for Darklina fans??

On a side note, pretty ptlretty please do a fan convention in the US. (with a cherry on top)"
Shadow,How do you prepare for more intimate scenes like the kissing scene with Jessie?
Shadow,will we get more Alina and Darkling content?
Shadow,Would the darkling listen to Taylor Swif?
Shadow,"Hello from Italy 🤗
What are you favourite memories from shooting Shadow and Bone season 2?
I really love all your performances and I'm so looking forward to see the new season just because you're in it. Lots of love xx"
Shadow,"Hello Ben! I have been a longtime fan of the series, and I love the nuance you bring to the Darkling! Book Darkling could feel like a cartoon villain sometimes, but you play him with so much care that the viewer sympathizes enough to hate themselves for rooting for him. 

Do you think the Darkling really cares for Alina as a person? If so, does he care about her because of her powers, or because she is the only one as endless as he is? Or is she just a pawn to him? 

Much thanks for reading, can't wait for season 2!"
Shadow,"After shadow and bone, would you like to work with Jessie again? She's so talented, and you two work perfectly together."
Shadow,"Hi, you are amazing villain in Shadow and Bone. 
The Darkling is my most favorite character on the show.I'm so excited to watch season2.

You've played roles of villains/bad guys many times.
Your acting is just amazing. And you seem like a very nice person. How do you separate your work and your private life? Has playing villains affected your private life?

I also wanna know funny behind the scenes stories about Shadow and Bone.


Lastly, watching Shadow and Bone helped me get through when I was in my lowest point of life. Thank you for your amazing work and your costar's amazing work. The show is so special for me."
Shadow,"I had no idea who you were before I watched Shadow & Bone but I became a big fan of the show almost entirely because of your scenes. Also I'm jealous I'll never be able to pull off an all black outfit like you can.

Anyways, you've been an actor for a majority of your life.  What is a role you wished you would be asked about more and why?"
Shadow,How is playing the Darkling different or similar to your previous roles?
Shadow,"Hello Ben ! I’m excited to see you back in season 2 ! And by the way, you have such a lovely singing voice ! My question is : What would be your dream project/role ?"
Shadow,"Which episode from Season 2 is your favourite, and why? Also hi, love you <3"
Shadow,"Hello Ben!! Not including the Darkling, who is your favourite Grishaverse character?"
Shadow,what can you tell us about the darkest part of shadow and bone season 2?
Shadow,Tell us one darkling's line you included in season 2
Shadow,fav darklina moment from the books?
Shadow,"What have you taken from your time as the Darkling? Either physical set objects, lessons, etc"
Shadow,"besides your character, who's the most interesting character for this season ?"
Shadow,what's your favorite thing about Aleksander?
Shadow,Hi Ben! Please tell us whether we get any Darklina goodness in S2? 🖤
Shadow,"If you could make up another Grisha power, what would it be?"
Shadow,"hi ben, i'm rewatching s&b s1 rn and i love your performance more somehow. i remember the fandom basically going crazy when you were cast, was that an overwhelming response? did it make the role less or more daunting and you less or more nervous?"
Shadow,What was the most fun scene to film from season one?
Shadow,"Hi Ben! 

My question for you is: if you could put any of the other movie or tv characters you played in the past in the Grishaverse (to be a hero or a villain, your choice) who would you choose and why?"
Shadow,who do you think would be the darkling favorite author and why? 🫵🏻
Shadow,Hi Ben! I love seeing your appreciation for the grishaverse books and Leigh - do you have a favourite scene from the S&B trilogy and a favourite scene from the SoC duology? Cant wait for s2!
Shadow,"Even though you play the darkling (and amazingly at that), which shadow and bone character do you think is most similar to you?"
Shadow,"Hey Ben! Hope you're doing well.
I wanted to ask if you have any book recommendations, I trust your taste. Thank you! Can't wait to see Shadow and Bone on Thursday."
Shadow,What’s your favorite book in the Grishaverse?
Shadow,"hi! absolutely ecstatic for the release of season 2 and i was wondering if the grishaverse was real, what place would you choose to travel to?
i’d personally love to explore the jurda farms in novyi zem!"
Shadow,What's your favorite line from the upcoming season? 🥺
Shadow,How did you prepare for the audition as the Darkling??
Shadow,who is your favourite crow?
Shadow,"Hey Ben! 
just wondering .. if you could play any of the six crows, which one would you pick and why?
sending love <3"
Shadow,why is darkling such an emo crying baby
Shadow,What do you think about Jessie? 🙂
Shadow,"Hey Ben! You always seem like such a fun, loving nice guy in social media and interviews but seem to have a preference for playing bad guys (and wonderfully, I must say, I've loved your roles in Westworld and Shadow & Bone, but have been a fan since Narnia). Can you share with us why? I'm guessing it's because it's fun to pretend to be someone else, but I wondered if there are other reasons.

Also, revealing the Darkling's real name was a significant thing in the Siege & Storm book and a very memorable line from Alina in Ruin & Rising, but in the show it's mentioned very early in the story. Why the change?"
Shadow,"hello ben!!! i’ve been a fan since your narnia days, but your role as aleksander in s&b and the show in general has meant a lot to me—i was juggling an intense degree program and taking care of a family member pretty much alone when s1 came out, and it was an escape that brought me lots of joy and led me to some amazing friends. thank you for the passion and commitment you bring to your craft and all the roles you play! 

actual question time: who’s your favorite poet? are there any particular poems or lines of poetry that are (figuratively) forever engraved in your brain?"
Shadow,"Hello!!! 🥰🥰🥰 I have seen you first in  ”Dorian Gray”at the cinema, though I was young, in my early twenties, and though I even deeply hated the book, you have done an amazing job, even then! But I loved you in “Easy Virtue”! And I adore your album!  In this series, though you are more good-looking than what I have pictured reading the books, you are still rocking it because I totally despise your character 😆 like in the books! And that means A LOT!👏👏👏 since I consider you a super sweet and handsome man!   


MY QUESTION:

Did you tried other characters in the show before be assigned to the General Kirigan? Or did you choose to do that role? Or were you being contacted only for that character?   


thank you 🙏 

I wish you well and have a lovely evening!

😘😘😘"
Shadow,"hi bin bons, have you seen supernatural and would you ever consider working with jensen ackles?"
Shadow,"Do you think The Darkling is right about that the path he wants to follow is the best for Ravka? 
Because after reading Six of Crows and Crooked Kingdom I think that if The Darkling were ruling, the Grisha would never be THAT threatened."
Shadow,When can we see you and Andrew Garfield together on screen? Hopefully in a Comedy? Or any other genre.
Shadow,do you think the darkling and magneto would be friends
Lord of Vermilion: The Crimson King,Ciaràn Hinds is brilliant.
Lord of Vermilion: The Crimson King,"Ciaran Hinds dies in everything I've seen him in, so I don't expect his character here to have a high chance of survival."
Lord of Vermilion: The Crimson King,Mance Rayder!
Lord of Vermilion: The Crimson King,Is Rory Kinnear gonna give birth to himself from his Rory Kinussy like in Men cuz if so i need to binge s1 fast.
Lord of Vermilion: The Crimson King,Can they add an interesting story?
Lord of Vermilion: The Crimson King,What role is George Constanza gonna be playing??
Lord of Vermilion: The Crimson King,actors i've heard of? in the highest budget show ever made? CRAZY
Lord of Vermilion: The Crimson King,"The first season was so boring and in many cases kind of stupid. Why was the dark lord on a life raft, he just coincidently met up with Galadriel? She just jumped off a ship and decided to swim across the ocean? The elf and the dwarf spent the entire season discussing what good friends they are. The volcano erupted, covered everyone in burning ash but everyone is okay. The army from Nimonea or wherever just happened to show up at a little village at the exact moment necessary with no pretext or reason. It was just stupid moment after stupid moment staring wooden 1 dimensional characters.

I wanted to like it, particularly with all the back lash regarding black elves, but man was it boring and dumb.

I wanted to add a bit of stupidity. The part time black smith enthusiast (turned out to be the lord of darkness or whatever) giving black smithing advice to the greatest black smith of all time, who has been doing it for thousands of years, and the black smith taking the advice, and being like ‘oh yeah, never thought of that’, wtf."
Lord of Vermilion: The Crimson King,"Yeah, but did they hire any good writers?"
Lord of Vermilion: The Crimson King,"bets are open about which one of those will play an asshole character, and which will play a good, strong, empowered and determined one"
Lord of Vermilion: The Crimson King,Can they add some new writers?
Lord of Vermilion: The Crimson King,"Biggest letdown I've ever seen on television. Every single scene and dialogue seems so fake and cringe. Unbelievable they didn't just copy paste the style from the movies, and they could have done pretty much anything story-wise. But when everything looks like plastic it has a long way."
Lord of Vermilion: The Crimson King,"they should ditch the showrunners as they did with picard season 3, but I don't think the show is redeemable"
Lord of Vermilion: The Crimson King,Mance!
Lord of Vermilion: The Crimson King,"I am a die-hard LotR fan, and I have read most of Tolkien's extended works, including the Silmarillion and The History of Middle-Earth. Love the films as well.


I thought Rings of Power was barely watchable. Terrible pacing, forgettable characters, and a wandering story that wasn't interesting in the least. The cinematography was gorgeous, and I liked the cast, but wow was the entire series a complete letdown for me.


I know that there is some conflict around the rights to Tolkien's original story, which I think is why the RoP went ""off-book."""
Lord of Vermilion: The Crimson King,"The show lost me when they went from boat, to full gallop, to battle, to victory all in the span of timecode that was no longer than 10 minutes.  I felt abused by a show I thought was pretty great up until then.  I'm not even sure they CAN win back my viewership when they set up an entire story/season which is working up to something then blow straight through it."
Lord of Vermilion: The Crimson King,Haven't seen Rory in anything since his fateful Black Mirror episode. 🐷
Lord of Vermilion: The Crimson King,Black Mirror ruined Rory Kinnear for me.
Lord of Vermilion: The Crimson King,Not even Ciaran Hinds will be able to save this show from itself.
Lord of Vermilion: The Crimson King,Good actors but no thank you.
Lord of Vermilion: The Crimson King,I'm still not going to watch it.  Season 1 was a bitter disappointment.
Lord of Vermilion: The Crimson King,Has anyone prepared Tanya for the “black”-lash to come? At this point it’s like predicting the weather…
Lord of Vermilion: The Crimson King,Why is everyone suddenly spelling Ciar**á**n Hinds's name with the fada the wrong way around
Lord of Vermilion: The Crimson King,This fan fiction will never be cannon in my eyes. This show was born out of Jeff Bezos lust for money and fame and the writers have an obvious hatred towards Tolkien’s vision. Fuck this show.
Lord of Vermilion: The Crimson King,Is anyone even looking forward this mess of a show anymore?
Lord of Vermilion: The Crimson King,Nah I’m done with this show. No way I come back for season 2
Lord of Vermilion: The Crimson King,"""You killed a Consul of Mordor!"" - Ciaran, probably"
Lord of Vermilion: The Crimson King,"Nice, now replace the showrunners."
Lord of Vermilion: The Crimson King,How wasn't this cancelled
Lord of Vermilion: The Crimson King,Just cancel it already
Lord of Vermilion: The Crimson King,"I found the first season pretty unwatchable, got about halfway through before bailing.  It was too hard to suspend disbelief and I found many of the characters uninspiring; the mediocre writing as well left a lot to be desired.   
To those that stuck with it...best of luck with Season 2!"
Lord of Vermilion: The Crimson King,*Worst fucking deal I’ve ever made.*
Lord of Vermilion: The Crimson King,"Maybe they'll be cast as Doromir and Agathirn in a party of harfoots and the wizard Brindorf to destroy a magical item in ~~The Southlands~~ Mordor.

Jesus Christ this show was a disappointment all throughout but especially at the end of Season 1. Capped by those cringeworthy fan service lines from The Stranger. What a complete and total waste of effort and resources."
Lord of Vermilion: The Crimson King,That show is dead.
Lord of Vermilion: The Crimson King,"It doesn't matter how many great actors they throw at this huge, stinking turd, it's still gonna be a huge, stinking turd!"
Lord of Vermilion: The Crimson King,"Have they got new show runners and/or writers?

If not it doesn't matter how good actors/actresses they get, you can only polish a turd so much."
Lord of Vermilion: The Crimson King,I’m most curious how long Amazon is going to persist with this farce to save face.
Lord of Vermilion: The Crimson King,Sooo is aragorn a black woman now
Lord of Vermilion: The Crimson King,how'd this trash get a second session?
Lord of Vermilion: The Crimson King,Bruh who is still funding this dumpster fire?
Lord of Vermilion: The Crimson King,The bald man is so handsome I fell in love with him when he appeared in penny dreadful.
Lord of Vermilion: The Crimson King,i really hope tanya moody's buds call her 'madeye' or it's all a waste
Lord of Vermilion: The Crimson King,"Whoa, I don't know Rory Kinnear, but I love his dad in all the Beatles movies"
Lord of Vermilion: The Crimson King,I cannot wait to fall asleep to this show. The first season was better than melatonin.
Lord of Vermilion: The Crimson King,Did they add new writers
Lord of Vermilion: The Crimson King,"Presuming middle guys an elf, ladies a hobbit, and old mans a teenage elendil? Calling it now"
Lord of Vermilion: The Crimson King,"Not interested at all. The first season wasn't good. The only thing I liked was the practical makeup/prosthetics for the orcs.

Everything else was just bland high fantasy garbage."
Lord of Vermilion: The Crimson King,"I will at least try season two but my hopes are low, the show is not horrible but it's definitely not good, it barely scratches mediocre for me. Some of the casting, the pacing, the writing, all of it could've been done so much better but I have my doubts these showrunners have the ability to pull it around, we'll see."
Lord of Vermilion: The Crimson King,I was so excited and also very hesitant to watch this lotr adaptation. I got through an episode and a half before realizing it really doesn’t exist in the lotr universe and was more for like little kids. Really disappointed hopefully PJ comes back one day
Lord of Vermilion: The Crimson King,Whattttttt?  Mance Rayder is joining LOTR?
Lord of Vermilion: The Crimson King,"Why was Sauron on a raft? Was he waiting for Galadriel?  Was it a happy accident? Where was he going? His entire backstory and all of his motivations are blown to bits the second that his identity is revealed so what were his motivations for the first 90% of the season? Was he just baiting Galadriel? Why was he on a raft?? WHY WAS HE OUT THERE? Was he leaving??? Did he somehow know she jumped out of a boat and he just set up the entire thing to run into her??

Also, why are the heroes being duplicitous? This is a universe where they (in the show!) establish that there is objective morality and the ends do not justify the means under any circumstance but everyone is acting like they're Game of Thrones characters trying to trick each other and hide their true motives even when it doesn't really serve them or their goals. The actions of the heroes are indistinguishable from the villains. Is the message that even in a binary ""good and evil"" world, there's not actually any good?

Why was he in the middle of the ocean??? What was he doing out there? Why did he go there? Why does he allow himself to be put in jail? Was that intentional? Why was his plan so dependent on other people acting in a very specific way? Can he predict the future? Can he bend them to his will already? If so, why the theatrics and convoluted series of events? WHY IS HE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE OCEAN?? It's almost like the show runners are dumb people who perceive ""smart"" as being complicated with a bunch of steps because they don't see anything else because they can't abstract the motivations of smart people because it's so foreign to them so they just thing it's them plotting out seemingly random things like they can predict the future. Surely that's not the case because there's no way this would be handed off to complete morons right?

Is the simple answer, ""~~because the writers are dumb~~?""

It can't be that! They paid a billion dollars. Why was he out there? Why are the elves dumb? Why are there old elves? Why the fuck are the elves so ugly? Why do they trudge through the snow?? They don't leave tracks in the snow. Why are they sinking into it??? Why is everyone not bowing to/falling in love with Galadriel? Why are the other elves not terrified of her? Why do none of them call her ""aunt"" or ""cousin""? Where is her husband? Did they make her single because they wanted a romantic temptation with the living personification of evil? Is she dumb because she's horny? That seems sexist. Can they not write a woman character without having some of her actions informed by temptation so they made her single? Are they that shallow? Do they think that little of their audience?

WHY IS HE ON A RAFT IN THE OCEAN FOR NO REASON AND WHY DOES ANYTHING ELSE HE DOES MAKE SENSE? WHAT WAS THE PURPOSE OF ALL OF THAT?"
Lord of Vermilion: The Crimson King,Rory Kinnear should appear in more shows/movies
Lord of Vermilion: The Crimson King,We're still getting a season 2 after the crap that season 1 was? ok then.
Lord of Vermilion: The Crimson King,That's nice. Now what will they do to add viewers?
Lord of Vermilion: The Crimson King,"Amazon employees are having a field day by commenting positively about this dumpster fire I see.

Its a ok serie when you don't compare it to the movies."
Lord of Vermilion: The Crimson King,"This will have what to do with Tolkien, again?"
Lord of Vermilion: The Crimson King,"Rory Kinnear is the most underrated actor in Hollywood. If you want a masterclass in acting, watch Penny Dreadful."
Lord of Vermilion: The Crimson King,I'm torn between never wanting to see or hear about RoP again and keep watching just to poke fun of it.
Lord of Vermilion: The Crimson King,"This show isn't as terrible as I thought it would be, definitely delivered far short of it's potential with some daft writing but it also had some genuinely good elements to it (Elrond and Durin were the strong point for me, they were fun to watch and I loved the atmosphere)

There were too many plots going at the one time and the show would constantly take the foot off the accelator when one plot started getting interesting and cut to another plot to spend 20 mins watching less interesting characters deliver dull monologues.  Constantly killing momentum at the exact moment something is about to happen, made the episodes feel like they were padding them out and were afraid to stay with a climatic moment for too long.

I'll give season two a chance, there's just enough there for me to come back to, but if they repeat the same mistakes then I'll probably bail at that point."
Lord of Vermilion: The Crimson King,But why? Did they already pay for the second season or something? Nobody's gonna suffer through another one.
Lord of Vermilion: The Crimson King,So the flop continues....
Lord of Vermilion: The Crimson King,"I find the hate this show gets really weird.

Ciaràn and Rory are great additions though. I haven't really seen anything Tanya Moodie has done"
Lord of Vermilion: The Crimson King,That guy in the middle looks like the host of hot ones
Lord of Vermilion: The Crimson King,Are they hiring better writers?
Lord of Vermilion: The Crimson King,"Another steaming pile of money, I have zero faith in this."
Lord of Vermilion: The Crimson King,Long haired elves or GTFO
Lord of Vermilion: The Crimson King,"I dug this show.  Sorry, my comment is not a pithy negging one-liner."
Lord of Vermilion: The Crimson King,Yea I’d be cautious attaching my name to that pos.
Lord of Vermilion: The Crimson King,"Rory Kinear will never be the same for me after watching Men. If you've seen it, you know why."
Lord of Vermilion: The Crimson King,Rory Kinnear was so bloody great in *Penny Dreadful* that the fact he didn’t win an Emmy (or Eva Green) just shows be how worthless award shows are.
Lord of Vermilion: The Crimson King,From the thumbnail it looked like Colin Robinson. Was curious the direction they’d be going with energy vampires.
Lord of Vermilion: The Crimson King,I think it’s the law that every old times HBO show wit swords and horses has to have hinds in it.
Lord of Vermilion: The Crimson King,Did they add any new writers
Lord of Vermilion: The Crimson King,Great stuff!!
Lord of Vermilion: The Crimson King,We needed Bill Burr though.
Lord of Vermilion: The Crimson King,"Can't have someone in that show doing a half decent Irish accent, so Ciaran can't be a harfoot anywho"
Lord of Vermilion: The Crimson King,Is the Show good?
Lord of Vermilion: The Crimson King,Mance effing Rayder
Lord of Vermilion: The Crimson King,so they didn't cancel season 2. why?
Lord of Vermilion: The Crimson King,"More majestic horse rides, please."
Lord of Vermilion: The Crimson King,Siiiiigh
Lord of Vermilion: The Crimson King,"It doesn't matter what they do going forward, after 5 episodes, I couldn't take it anymore."
Lord of Vermilion: The Crimson King,"Reddit's obsession with this show continues to blow my mind. Even the people who love it don't care about it as much as the people who hate it.

Don't you all get tired of saying the same thing over and over again?"
Lord of Vermilion: The Crimson King,Who cares about this dogwater show. It doesn't deserve the name LOTR
Lord of Vermilion: The Crimson King,"Cool. I won’t watch this season, either."
Lord of Vermilion: The Crimson King,this show sucks ass they're getting wasted
Lord of Vermilion: The Crimson King,Won't change the writing.
Lord of Vermilion: The Crimson King,Maybe the story will be better
Lord of Vermilion: The Crimson King,"Great show, despite what the smoothbrains on reddit think. The visuals and costumes were amazing."
Lord of Vermilion: The Crimson King,"They could add the entire cast of the original movies and I still wouldn't watch this hot garbage. They ruined it before it even got off the ground with those Tolkien-hating show runners and writers who thought they could actually one-up Tolkien with his own world building and characterizations. Galadriel as presented as the heroic female lead of this crap is not just a pale shadow of what is represented in the books, she's a complete bastardization of her. As to the rest...just crap after crap after crap. I definitely won't be coming around for season 2. When it comes to adapting fantasy ""franchises"" such as this and Wheel of Time, Amazon has no clue what they are doing and neither do the show runners they hire."
Lord of Vermilion: The Crimson King,"More diversity castings, whata surprise… just make a portion set in the damn east if you want dark people in lotr, theyre not in the west… the blue wizards could be spotlighted aswell"
Lord of Vermilion: The Crimson King,I think I’m the only one on Reddit that genuinely enjoyed the show.
Lord of Vermilion: The Crimson King,Who cares? Travesty they are going to make another season.
Lord of Vermilion: The Crimson King,"I love how upset people are about this news. ""What? But I *personally do not like this*! Noooo, how can people think differently than me???"
Lord of Vermilion: The Crimson King,Wait. How is there a season 2 after the massive train wreck that season 1 was?
Lord of Vermilion: The Crimson King,"If they want to throw millions away and see it come back, hire whoever made *the Last Of Us*, they have a good story and a good cast"
Lord of Vermilion: The Crimson King,"Well it wasnt exactly better actors this show neede.. Oh well it did, but it needed better writers first and foremost !"
Lord of Vermilion: The Crimson King,Still going to be mid though…
Lord of Vermilion: The Crimson King,Apparently they can't stop until they ruin the next big cultural mythical franchise. I already feel sorry that such a great actor as Ciaran will waste his energy on that guaranteed train wreck.
Lord of Vermilion: The Crimson King,Have they hired new writers yet?
The Order,That ruined the series for me.
The Order,"Yeah, that annoyed me too. I can understand WHY the Magi did it, but I do feel it was foolish, but then again... Magic using doesn't mean you are wise."
The Order,i thought it was fine idk. i only watched it for todd.
The Order,Yeah. I didn't even watch the 2nd season after that scene. It sucked because I really enjoyed the first season right up till then.
The Order,"Did you watch season 2? Because you are talking about a problem that doesn't really exist in the second season

Some spoilers for the first episode of season 2

>!It is revealed that the memory erasure isn't really permanent and so The Order have to keep someone close to each of the werewolves inorder to keep erasing their memories everytime they are close to remembering!<

I guess after finishing season 1 you have no idea that it will turn out that way so I understand if it's frustrating"
The Order,It was more that the whole thing felt so stupid that I lost all faith in the writing. I never watched season 2. That scene ruined the whole series for me.
The Order,"Holy shit, yes! This is the exact kind of premise I'm always here for."
The Order,"I actually love the sound of this, could be a lot of fun. Given that it's on NBC I won't expect it to last long but I'll watch it if it gets a series order."
The Order,">On the TV side, Perfect Storm Entertainment is in production on the third season of crime drama Warrior for HBO Max

Well there's the damn news I was looking for!"
The Order,">	and Star Trek: Beyond, the *final* film in the modern Star Trek trilogy"
The Order,More Merlin magic shenanigans taking place in current times pls. Hopefully it is also gothic like Sleepy Hollow.
The Order,[deleted]
The Order,Great signing voice. She killed it as Sally in The Nightmare Before Christmas
The Order,Finding out celebrities are Canadian gives me the opposite feeling when they’re Scientologists. 
The Order,Way to go Moira! Kids congratulate your mother
The Order,"I remember watching her a long time back on the old SCTV.  Always thought she didn't get the recognition she deserved, so this is nice to see."
The Order,"Known mostly for playing a mom in Home Alone and Beetlejuice, she also was the incredible voice of Sally from Nightmare Before Christmas. Her performance on Schitt’s Creek is excellent. She’s a true performer."
The Order,"For those who only really knew her as Kevin's mum in Home Alone, she was part of SCTV, a sort of Canadian SNL. As a kid of the 80's and 90's I had no idea how many recognisable faces started on SCTV

John Candy  
Rick Moranis  
Martin Short  
Joe Flaherty - He was the guy who tries to wreck things in Happy Gilmore and the dad in Freaks and Geeks  
Eugene Levy- Jim's Dad in American Pie  
Andrea Martin- Aunt Voula in My Big Fat Greek Wedding  
Catherine O'Hara - Kevin's Mum in Home Alone  
Harold Ramis - Ghostbusters!  
Dave Thomas- The Pharmacist in Grace Under Fire


"
The Order,Long overdue recognition. Congratulations!
The Order,"Wow even though she’s got two left feet!

Edit: Eugene had the two left feet, she had the bum knee"
The Order,"This is for Lola Heatherton!  ""I love you Sammy.  I want to bear your children.  Ha ha ha ha ha."""
The Order,So we’re just giving out the highest honors to negligent mothers? Nobody thinks about Kevin. 
The Order,"She is just fantastic on ""Schitt's Creek"".  The whole cast is perfect."
The Order,"It's a great day for Canada, and therefore the world. "
The Order,I feel like she left something (or someone) home again.
The Order,GIVE HER ALL THE AWARDS!!!!!!!!!
The Order,That’s what happens when you sell your soul to the devil on Christmas Eve.
The Order,No shit...lol...she is amazing as Moira ...It would be classic if she accepted the award with that ridiculous affect Moira has on the show.
The Order,"I dont know much about the Order of Canada, but I think it comes with the ability to make one decree that must be carried out and made into law. "
The Order,Cookie...? Cookie googleman? 
The Order,"Good for her. I’ve enjoyed her  oeuvre. 

I hope she does better counts at the airport, though "
The Order,I didn’t even know she was Canadian. That’s how good she is. 
The Order,WHAT DO YOU KNOW ABOUT PRESSURE?!
The Order,"""There she is, dipping her hand in the ceremonial bowl of pudding, as per tradition.."""
The Order,So...like what was Canada’s order? Pancakes?
The Order,Well deserved. She was particularly good in a recurring role as a control freak Hollywood producer in Six Feet Under.
The Order,It was an honor to work with her. An incredible talent.
The Order,Canadian National treasure 
The Order,Damn I'm pretty sure I would go to jail if I lost my kid hundreds of miles away. Twice. 
The Order,Fun fact: amongst her many other roles she is the voice of Sally in The Nightmare Before Christmas.
The Order,She is an absolute treasure. I adore her work.
The Order,Does this mean she can now give orders to Canadians?
The Order,this headline feels like a palindrome.
The Order,Boo.  Shame.  Lady cannot not keep track of her kids. 
The Order,I wanted her to be my aunt when I was young. Seems like such a positive spirit - congratulations!
The Order,She’s so wonderful!
The Order,"""You're serving nothing but lies"" "
The Order,Say the title of this thread 10 times fast. 
The Order,[deleted]
The Order,I'm getting mine on Friday. Woot woot. 
The Order,"Why did she get the order of Canada? For acting? I like her but really, are they just giving these medals to anyone now? "
The Order,Who?
The Order,"Nice plastic surgery job. She's starting to look like the kid from ""Mask"". 

I wonder how much she charges to haunt a house?"
The Order,I don't know how this show is escaping the mainstream.  It's absolutely hilarious.  My wife and I just randomly stumbled upon it on Netflix and it's one of our favorite shows now.
The Order,Holy crap. One of the funniest shows I've ever seen. She's an absolute gem. I love her vocabulary.
The Order,Daaaveeeddd I think I killed A MAN!
The Order,She's fantastic in it. She genuinely made me dislike her character. Very good actress.
The Order,"This is one of those shows I would have never watched unless it was recommended to me, so happy I gave it a chance "
The Order,Agreed. Netflix binge on that on Thanksgiving. More interesting and less commercials than football. 
The Order,Just started this show. It is pretty great. 
The Order,[deleted]
The Order,Didn't realize she'd teamed back up with Eugene Levy.  
The Order,Watched it a few weeks ago and I NEED MORE!
The Order,"REALLY tried to get into that show, especially being a huge SCTV and Levy and Ohara fan but watched about 4 episodes and had to stop it was so unfunny. I went into the schitts creek group and they said it gets better but those first few episodes were a hard watch."
The Order,[deleted]
The Order,Damn I had no idea that was her!
The Order,"> Great signing voice. 

I've been told Marlee Matlin has the best signing voice."
The Order,"she comes from a musical family

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary\_Margaret\_O%27Hara](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Margaret_O%27Hara)"
The Order,Absolutely. Great vocals for the part.
The Order,Still can’t get over the irony of Elisabeth Moss playing the lead in Handmaid’s Tale when she’s a Scientologist IRL
The Order,I've always wanted her and Alyson Hannigan to play mother and daughter.
The Order,"Wtf I had no idea she was Sally! I also had no idea about Schitt’s Creek, definitely gonna have to watch that one."
The Order,[deleted]
The Order,"Y'know, I've always found SCTV to be way funnier than SNL.  I just think they had a better grasp on timing and not focusing too much on one joke that's not working.  

Like, the Battle of the PBS Stars always kills me, Rick Moranis' Dick Cavett is uncanny: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-2JsACs1pw"
The Order,"Fun Fact: She was also cast in SNL but quit before her first episode to return to SCTV. However, she did host SNL twice. "
The Order,"And thanks to them, we know exactly [what fits into Russia!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Zm6HzN5YVI)"
The Order,"SNL casts generally have included lots of people with Second City backgrounds, whether in Chicago or Toronto. Flaherty and Martin are both US-born."
The Order,"The greatest show of all time. My favorite. You watch them today and they're very dated but they're still hilarious. 

The Fantasy island skit is one of my all time favorites, with Hope and Crosby."
The Order,Dave Thomas is Mista F on Arrested Development too. 
The Order,"Andrea Martin is also in Great News, a funny show that was cancelled too soon"
The Order,Thought that was Eugene Levy's character in Best in Show.
The Order,Those are her flippers 
The Order,Hopefully Canada used the 'good' Order of Canada and that it wasn't declined.
The Order,Is it made of maple syrup?
The Order,Moose bacon and scrambled canada goose eggs covered in Maple Syrup.
The Order,and Shock
The Order,Yeah but julie payette...woof
The Order,She's had a very successful career in comedy for over 40 years now.
The Order,"Counterpoint

It's just the order of Canada. Relax buddy."
The Order,The mom from Home Alone.
The Order,"Jesus, fuck off?"
The Order,FYI it airs on Pop ahead of Netflix by a few months.  New season premieres every January.
The Order,I tried the first couple of episodes and couldn't get into it.  Does it get better?
The Order,"It's the ""wacky"" sitcom name, the cheesy cast photos and the fact that the lead male is mostly known for flogging the American pie series to death, that's my reason anyway."
The Order,Its a very specific type of humor it’s not for mainstream audiences 
The Order,I didn't like it to be honest :/
The Order,I asked if anyone watched it on a forum and people were basically shaming me for liking it. They're idiots.
The Order,It’s time for Brehk-Fehst
The Order,"It does get better. There's a point where they stop focusing on the elevator pitch version of the show and it allows the characters to grow together, but in different directions which also leads to a more varied plot line to keep things fresh. Also, Chris Elliott is spread a little thinner throughout as more people get bigger parts and that also helps (which is rough to say because I adore Chris Elliott, but Roland Schitt can be a bit much)"
The Order,Please keep at it. And then rewatch. The first few were not that great for me until I “got” it and then got so much better
American Idol,It was actually fun to watch! Wish shows would be crazy like that more often.
American Idol,"That was really something else. I don't know which network executive threw the darts on the board to make it, but the world is a better place for it"
American Idol,Way better than Doctor Steve-O but not as good as Wildboys.
American Idol,MILF ~~Island~~ Manor is available for your batshit insane crazy watching needs.
American Idol,But there isn't any karaoke corresponding with very weird shit...
American Idol,I’d also recommend Bitch Hunter.
American Idol,Um I'm too classy for that incestuous nonsense. I prefer reality shows where contestants are pressured in to eating testicles from various animals.
American Idol,It gets me amped up and ready for another episode of Sports Shouting.
American Idol,"Um I’m too classy for that incestuous nonsense. I prefer reality shows where contestants are pressured in to **eating testicles from various animals.**

I mean, if eating is used in the sexual sense and all the animals are human, this might just be your show."
American Idol,"Skimming through his IMDb page & he worked with so many bands: Stones, Santana, Rush, Alice Cooper, Supertramp & even Sparks RIP."
American Idol,"Original Amateur Hour. The show lasted on radio until 1952 and until 1970 on television. Auditions for the show were generally held in New York's Radio City Music Hall. Those who passed the initial screening were invited to compete on the program, featuring amateurs whose performance were judged by viewers, voting via letters and phone calls. Contestants who won three times earned cash prizes, scholarships, or participation in a traveling stage show associated with the program. (from Wikipedia)"
American Idol,"America's Funniest Home Videos.

Total Request Live."
American Idol,"In Germany, the automated phone voting system ""[Tele-Dialog](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tele-Dialog)"" (TED) was introduced in 1979. The show ""Wetten, dass..?"" started using it in 1981 to let viewers vote on simple yes/no questions. And starting in 1982, the charts show ""ZDF-Hitparade"" used it to let viewers vote for songs.

In other countries, it was adapted under the name ""TeleVote"".

Before that, there was also the ""[Lichttest](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lichttest)"" (light test), that didn't even need phones. Viewers in a pre-selected city could vote by switching their electric appliances on or off. The local energy provider then reported the change in energy usage to the show's team. The show ""[Wünsch Dir was](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/W%C3%BCnsch_Dir_was_\(Fernsehshow\))"" (1969-1972) used it to let viewers choose one of the participating families as winners."
American Idol,I miss the old big brother format where on eviction night they showed the house guest diary room confession showing why they are voting to keep and evict someone. Wish they’d bring that back
American Idol,The Eurovision Song Contest
American Idol,Cheaters feeds on human misery and embarassing people and a lot of people don't like those types of shows.
American Idol,I guess Cheaters never prospered
American Idol,because people take it too personally. they can see themselves in that situation and it scares or creeps them out.
American Idol,"I actually agree that Cheaters is better than the shows you listed but that doesn't matter when it comes to popularity.

Cheaters sensitive subject matter gives it less widespread appeal than these other shows.

Also cheaters(in my experience, correct me if I'm wrong) always aired when many people were at work/school, which limits the potential audience."
American Idol,"There is a genre of reality TV that I call ""trashy""... Maury. Any judge show. And cheaters.
I know some people love the trashy shows.  But they make me cringe SO hard.  I imagine some people feel the same way so the show had a huge disadvantage to start with"
American Idol,"Cheaters was unrelated to these.

It was more in the vein of the generic/fun dating shows, like third wheel and dismissed and whatever that blind date one where they put funny captions on the screen was. The premise was different, but at the time it was released it was in this bucket, not the ""Reality TV"" bucket."
American Idol,"Survivor and American Idol don't really belong in that list. The appeal of them is that they're competitions, with an eventual winner and people being eliminated along the way. They're very different than all the others you named. Cheaters is also pretty different than the others in that it changes cast, the others follow the same group of people. People won't get invested the same way if people are in one episode and then gone."
American Idol,Staged but entertaining.
American Idol,"A lot of it was fake, and it was a misery to watch. Peak cringe.

Pawnstars is fake but it is positive TV.

To Catch a Predator was cringe and people committed suicide. 

The Kardashians are famous because they keep banging famous black guys.."
American Idol,"I mean, that’s like exactly what shows Maury, Jerry Springer and cops do and they were best hits."
American Idol,Well done Sir.
American Idol,Well it did and didnt. Obviously they made money as they are still on the air 20 years later. But you look at how certain reality shows blow up hugely popular and I am blown away Cheaters never got that way in terms of popularity. Its so good. I can't believe a boring biker show like Sons of Anarchy was more popular than Cheaters.
American Idol,"How is it trashy? They are exposing bad people and helping innocent people who got cheated on.  


 A trashy show is like these ones where they celebrate teen moms and glorify it which makes a bunch of dumb high school girls go out and get themselves pregnant and adds to the overpopulation and increases our tax dollars."
American Idol,"Those shows did have some balance, at least for a while. It’s more watchable if some uplifting stuff is mixed in."
American Idol,"Wait...you think it was real?!

> The producers of Cheaters currently reiterate the reality of each episode in a legalistic message at its end, though a Federal Communications Commission representative confirmed to the Houston Press that **""there's no law or regulation against presenting acted-out scenarios as reality on television.""**

Several people who’d been on the show, were tracked down. They said they’d been paid around $400 per episode, by a detective from the agency, to appear on ‘Cheaters.’ Furthermore, they received $50 for referrals of other actors."
American Idol,"From the snippets I've seen it's usually trashy people.    Just like maury or judge Judy.  It's people acting poorly educated or are really poorly educated.  
A person of ""class"" would not want their dirty laundry aired on national television.  THE HOST GOT STABBED FOR PETES SAKE.  This show isn't the creme of the crop"
American Idol,I would imagine the cheaters got paid because in some episodes the cheaters faces and blurred out and named not revealed. In other episodes they have the faces and names revealed. So if the got paid that means they gave consent to use their likeness.
American Idol,Unlocked memory when he got stabbed on a boat.
American Idol,"When I see him, I will always think of Mock Trial with J Reinhold."
American Idol,"After the first season, I just watched the auditions and stopped once the actual competition in Hollywood started"
American Idol,"Just had to put this here:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gT6RP3Oo58M"
American Idol,Personally would’ve kicked him out for that haircut but this works too
American Idol,I totally get American Idol dropping him. He was a kid and he’s still young. If he genuinely learns from this he can make it back. I just hope he doesn’t lean further into it as some do
American Idol,"Before I saw the picture, I thought ""this may be a bit much"".  After seeing the picture?  Yeah, definitely a KKK hood.  

I never was a fan of that guy, but, being from the south, he should probably know that the KKK isn't a funny thing to make light of, even at 12"
American Idol,[deleted]
American Idol,"Guys, his mom said he has friends of all races though."
American Idol,[deleted]
American Idol,"The dude was 12. Like? What's the point of telling people to change, if when they do they still get treated like who they were.  

Yes racism is wrong, but so is continuing to punish someone if they've changed. 

Nevermind that if this kid *had* changed, he's likely to embrace racism now since there isn't a reason not to since he's going to be treated like one anyway. 

This shit is dumb. It's just causing a bigger divide. No conversation is being had about allowing people to change. Just binary, aggressive action."
American Idol,"Yikes. After Graham DeFranco got voted out, this was the guy I rooted for. Sad to see this happen."
American Idol,I guarantee every person in this thread has made racist or non PC jokes when they were twelve. All of a sudden you want accountability now so you can feel morally superior.
American Idol,"I have met Caleb and his family, he is a loving and shy soft spoken young man who holds absolutely no hate in his heart."
American Idol,So he’s 16 now and was 12 when this happened? Jesus… Is it really that big of a deal? Is he still doing it? Is he actively a racist? No? I guess now we are cancelling and shaming children.
American Idol,"We are cancelling teenagers now for doing stuff when they were 12? Holy molly, self-righteous indignation is a disease. What happened to actually teaching someone. Have him get help, who knows where he is right now as a adult. Than make him write something down about how that video was wrong and lets move on and hope him the best in life. 

Cancelling him and setting him back in a tuff career already, yikes."
American Idol,That guy was awful.
American Idol,"I mean, his name is Caleb...

That's a warning itself"
American Idol,Another racist with close set eyes vying for the next “Country” star role. He just needs to see if he can get a gig opening for  Morgan Wallen
American Idol,"Only twitter dipshits could get off on mobbing a kid for something stupid he did when he was 12, it’s so gross. Glad social media wasn’t as prevalent quite yet when I was in middle school, people would say all kinds of stupid shit because we thought we were funny and were trying to shock everyone. Not saying it’s right but kids are dumb fucks. Kind of gross of them not to stand behind him, but that’s the world we live in, unfortunately."
American Idol,[deleted]
American Idol,Who?
American Idol,I had no idea American Idol still existed
American Idol,"I don't watch this American Idol drivel, but yeah it looks like this dude deserved to get kicked for a multitude of reasons. He clearly has impaired judgement if he ever thought posting that on social media was ever a good idea."
American Idol,"> being from the south, he should probably know that the KKK isn't a funny thing to make light of

I think you're underestimating how racist the South is and that having an open biased against Blacks is not uncommon or looked down upon. I moved to the South and it's shocking how causal racism is here. People will say they aren't racist but will still believe every negative stereotype you can think of. People here, literally don't understand what racism is. No one is teaching them, no one here is talking about it. Sure they know that racism is ""bad"" but that means nothing if you don't know what racism is. The KKK isn't really a mainstream thing here anymore but that is just a sign of the disconnect people feel with the past behaviors of their grandparents and the continued casual racism that surrounds them. So I don't think you will find many 12 year olds in the South who would associate a white hood with the pain, murder and hatred that the hood truly represents."
American Idol,Can you link to the picture? Shocking it is not in the article
American Idol,"actually, being from the south increases the chance of being racist, not the opposite."
American Idol,"how is this an ok talking point? you did racist, hateful, bigoted things as a teen to be edgy? I'd still question your judgement today."
American Idol,Not anymore. VA been blue for a while
American Idol,[deleted]
American Idol,">Nevermind that if this kid had changed, he's likely to embrace racism now since there isn't a reason not to since he's going to be treated like one anyway.

This is frankly ridiculous. God forbid he actually face (momentary) consequences for his actions. *Better let him off scot-free, or else he won't learn!*"
American Idol,"Honest question.  Who is to say if he has or hasn't changed?  How would you really know.  

He is 16 now, so its not like it was THAT long ago.  I'm not saying he can't change, or that he hasn't.  But this is a pretty damning picture.  I get Disney wanting no part of this. 

And his life isn't ruined.  If a label wants to sign him, they can still sign him.  I have a feeling Disney and the producers won't be eager to hold on to that contract."
American Idol,Hey man I don’t know if you’re aware but most 12 year olds don’t make a Klan hood for themselves and somehow completely mature out of any racist mindset in the span of 3-4 years. This kid will be fine. Racists will hoist him up and give him money in no time.
American Idol,"Idk about you, but when I was 12, I wasn't a kkk enthusiast. If that makes me me an uppity do-gooder with a chip on their shoulder, then, well, so be it."
American Idol,"12 year olds are not mature enough to use social media. But if they do, they have to be prepared to face the consequences. This was a stupid video to make, and even stupider to post to social media. Consider this consequences for being stupid."
American Idol,"How do you know if he is or isn't actively racist?  And what does ""actively a racist"" mean anyway.  he has white supremist ideals, but since he doesn't literally harass black people, its fine?"
American Idol,“actively racist” has to be the most unintentionally hilarious hair splitting I’ve seen in a while. You seem really upset that a racist dwerp is getting called out.
American Idol,"can't dress up as the klan and post it publicly without being temporarily shamed 

smh

this is Bidens America!"
American Idol,"I’m sure the environment he grew up in that encouraged these “jokes” has evolved greatly since. A true revolution in thought, empathy, and culture. 

He was even thinking of profiting from using hip hop in his country music. A true progressive."
American Idol,"being dropped from a single show = cancelled? is his life over?

you can get fired for doing a single dumb thing at a real job. some of you kids should get out into the real world some day

because all these fake tears say a lot about all of you as people and the guilt you feel"
American Idol,"I mean, he is only 16 now, not really an adult"
American Idol,"If his name was “Tex” or “Chet”, should have been a huge red flag from the beginning"
American Idol,[deleted]
American Idol,"Hey man, shut up."
American Idol,"Getting to appear on a major television program isn't a human right, nor does such a program have any obligation to elevate people or situations that society abhors."
American Idol,"For a lot of things, I'd definitely agree. 

And in general, I don't agree with combing through people's past social media to find things to say ""gotcha"". 

that said, this is really bad.  As they say, you can't put the toothpaste back in the tube.  This was 4 years ago.  Its not like he is 15 years removed.  I think you can argue certain times situations like this are blown out of proportion.  This is 12 year old whose friend is wearing a KKK hood."
American Idol,[deleted]
American Idol,"In many situations, i tend to agree that being young and dumb is a thing. In this case, however, it feels like you are referring specifically to white kids. Because black kids oftentimes become painfully aware that white hoods are racist from a verrry young age. Age just doesnt feel like a justification for this because it is very possible to know this is not okay at 12."
American Idol,"Carrie Underwood, which I’m just assuming you forgot to mention, is probably the biggest ever. I haven’t watched the show lately but I think some other blonde country girl got big recently. Couldn’t name any others with any sort of success in terms of longevity. Chris Daughtry for a minute I suppose."
American Idol,Is Jennifer Hudson doing music?
American Idol,Chris Daughtry
American Idol,Phillip Phillips
American Idol,Scotty McCreery
American Idol,Gabby Barret from the latest season.
American Idol,Don’t know why you’re getting downvoted sounds right to me.
American Idol,"I've never lived in the south, so I honestly don't know.  That said, I did teach Jr. High.  And 12 year olds are fully capable of understanding this type of thing.  Now whether HE was taught and understood it, I don't know.  But 12 year olds definitely can understand racism, even if its not too distant racism."
American Idol,South? It's probably the school formal uniform
American Idol,Yeah keep peddling that bigoted view of the south.

American Idol,"There's a shit ton of reasons to not be racist, that doesn't mean dick to racists. I'm not saying it's right or logical, but neither is racism. 

While different, I have seen plenty of people embrace the ""well fuck you then"" mentality with enough things that a young kid going full tilt into the thing he (maybe) tried to stop being isn't impossible. Stubbornness manifests in some bad places."
American Idol,[deleted]
American Idol,Momentary? Are you for real? Exactly the same people will crucify him for this like 20 years later.
American Idol,Kinda silly to think another label is gonna sign him after American Idol just dropped him. Dude will never get a record deal because no ones gonna want that bad publicity.
American Idol,">And his life isn't ruined.

Until the day he dies, his name will be associated with racism. That means he's fucked if he wants any sort of career in singing."
The Assassination of Gianni Versace,"its tough to compare it, since the OJ season was amazing, but does this compare? I grew up in Miami, so im familiar with the story, Might give it a shot this weekend"
The Assassination of Gianni Versace,"Looking back on it now, I think it would be much better to watch this season as a binge instead of weekly because of the way it was mapped out and went in reverse. I know a lot of people didn't appreciate the reverse storyline, but I absolutely loved it. Also, Darren Criss deserves all the praise and awards he won. He was incredible."
The Assassination of Gianni Versace,"One of the best shows I've watched in the past year. Honestly something I might re-watch someday, which is saying a lot for a television miniseries. Darren Criss is absolutely haunting."
The Assassination of Gianni Versace,Watch it backwards suckas!
The Assassination of Gianni Versace,"I just started watching this week. We're 3 episodes in and really enjoying it. Criss is knocking it out of the park. We hated him immediately (the character, not the actor), and continue to hate him more and more. So he's doing a smashing job."
The Assassination of Gianni Versace,"Remember that fella, who was so good at fashion that they had to shoot him?"
The Assassination of Gianni Versace,Anyone else really not enjoy this season as much as the first?
The Assassination of Gianni Versace,At the expense of People vs. OJ :(
The Assassination of Gianni Versace,Watched it when it was on TV. Fantastic series. 
The Assassination of Gianni Versace,"Compared to season one, this was terrible"
The Assassination of Gianni Versace,[deleted]
The Assassination of Gianni Versace,"I'm in the US and only Season 1 of American Crime Story (OJ) is available now, what happened? "
The Assassination of Gianni Versace,So Versace was *Assassinated* now? I didn't know he was that goddamned important...I thought someone shot and killed him...
The Assassination of Gianni Versace,"I thought it was better, and it is a beautiful show to watch. "
The Assassination of Gianni Versace,Just as good. Some episodes are even better. It's really odd how much better this show is than everything else Ryan Murphy has done.
The Assassination of Gianni Versace,"Yes, IMO, very much so.  I personally prefer it to OJ, and I'm saying that as someone who was blown away by the OJ one, and didn't think this one would measure up.  In this one, the personal stakes felt so much higher; the penultimate episode with his father alone was a leap up from the OJ series, great as that was.  Try it, I don't think you'll regret it.  Just one thing, the way this was mapped out isn't very traditional and might throw you off a bit.  "
The Assassination of Gianni Versace,I thought it was better. Very dark and disturbing. 
The Assassination of Gianni Versace,[deleted]
The Assassination of Gianni Versace,"I didn't like it and didn't finish, I thought PvOJ was pretty good. It (AoGV) felt a little gratuitous, which is also why I dropped AHS at Hotel. I assume that is because it's Ryan Murphy.

Acting was good, the story just didn't grab me unfortunately."
The Assassination of Gianni Versace,"Yes, it's amazing. Close to the same level as the first season.

But it's completely different. Feels like a different show."
The Assassination of Gianni Versace,"It was decent, but nowhere near the level of OJ, IMO."
The Assassination of Gianni Versace,"I did binge this, and definitely found it effective that way, although I think the finale struggled to make an impact compared to that amazing penultimate episode. "
The Assassination of Gianni Versace,"Yes, I thought the reverse method was surprisingly effective.  I remember reading that Ryan Murphy and co. wanted it that way because they didn't want viewers to feel sympathetic for Cunannan, which might have happened if they had went with a more traditional chronological style.  "
The Assassination of Gianni Versace,"Watching it as it aired, it definitely picked up a lot more as the reverse storyline unfolded."
The Assassination of Gianni Versace,"Just burned through all episodes and it’s brilliant. Loved the way the episodes were arranged, and Criss deserves every bit of praise he gets. And Aimee Mann! "
The Assassination of Gianni Versace,"> Darren Criss is absolutely haunting.

I always tell people that he did such a fantastic job that I quickly forgot early on that I was watching Darren Criss portraying Andrew Cunanan. It felt I was actually watching Andrew Cunanan. He practically became him on screen. He deserved every single award he won for this role."
The Assassination of Gianni Versace,"I think that you pretty much have it spot on.  I really did not like the reverse chronological nature of the episodes.  I was living in San Diego at the time, so I was pretty familiar with the events, but even so I did get confused as to what the hell was going on.  It probably would have been better to maybe start with the assassination, then go all the way back to his childhood so you could see how he ended up the way that he did."
The Assassination of Gianni Versace,"The problem with watching it backwards, which Ryan Murphy and the show's writers stated, is that the early episodes humanize Cunanan too much, and you feel more sympathetic to him, when you absolutely should not. He was a monster."
The Assassination of Gianni Versace,Would it really be okay to watch this backwards? I very rarely enjoy non linear story telling 
The Assassination of Gianni Versace,And then made a show that was supposedly about his assassination but only reaally made it into two episodes?
The Assassination of Gianni Versace,I enjoyed it more than the first 
The Assassination of Gianni Versace,"They are almost two completely different shows so it's difficult to compare them.

One I knew a lot about, and it was kind of fun to see a well-made dramatization of something I remember taking over the entire country during my childhood. The other I knew almost nothing about. 

I think if you took away the cultural context and had someone born 10 years after OJ watch it, it wouldn't be quite as compelling, whereas TAoGV would still be the excellent, haunting character study it is. The fact that it's a true story almost doesn't even matter."
The Assassination of Gianni Versace,"Very polarizing season of tv.  You’ll get people saying it was a masterpiece and people saying they hated it.

Personally, I liked The People vs OJ more, but liked them both a lot.  If I’m rating them, I’d give PvOJ like 9/10, and Versace 8/10."
The Assassination of Gianni Versace,"I brought all episodes on a long flight. Bored the fuck out of me. Criss was fine, but the pace, the palette - something about it was off putting."
The Assassination of Gianni Versace,"It was [spoiler](#s ""a meth scab"")"
The Assassination of Gianni Versace,"It's still on Netflix but they moved it to a different page apparently 

https://www.netflix.com/title/81091015"
The Assassination of Gianni Versace,"It might be because Ryan didn't write any episodes himself and appears to have served more in a producer role;  this season was penned by Tom Rob Smith, who is primarily a novelist. "
The Assassination of Gianni Versace,Have you seen Feud: Bette and Joan?  I think that’s on par with ACS.
The Assassination of Gianni Versace,You hate fashion?
The Assassination of Gianni Versace,I too actually stopped AHS after hotel for a bit. I eventually came back to it and enjoyed it. But Apocolypse (Season 8) was really great in my opinion. It brought in Cody a great actor to play Michael Langdon. One thing I keep coming back to for AHS is the storyline and the actors. It's very enjoyable to see how things play out in the different seasons.
The Assassination of Gianni Versace,"Yeah, although I find that's the case with a lot of television these days; all the powerful significant stuff happens in the episode before the finale, whereas the finale serves more as an epilogue and a prologue to set up for the next season (if there is one).  But yeah, they weren't going to beat that episode with his father, that was amazing and my favorite episode of anything that year.  "
The Assassination of Gianni Versace,100% encapsulates my thoughts lol. And yeah the finale was definitely underwhelming although it does make sense given it's meant to show you how hopeless Cunanan had gotten. 
The Assassination of Gianni Versace,Yeah if they showed it in order you'd end up feeling sorry for a complete monster up until at least car jacking rubbed your face in it with how bad he really was
The Assassination of Gianni Versace,Definitely effective. I just finished the Jeff Trail background episode and I thought it was a great way to finally emphasize the political/social context of the time period without it being an excuse for Cunannan's actions. Instead it just provided additional insight into the vulnerability of the victims before they even met Cunannan and how they got wrapped up with him in the first place.
The Assassination of Gianni Versace,"I had no idea who Mr. Criss was before this, but look forward to whatever he has coming down the pipeline next.  He was simply incredible.  "
The Assassination of Gianni Versace,"When this season ended on FX. I just thought to myself when this comes to Netflix I'm gonna watch it backwards. Haha Either way both ways is fine. 
I think the producers of the show is trying to isolate the audience to have sympathy or side with Cunanan. That's why the 1st episode featured the assassination. If the show starts with his childhood audience will think oh his life sucks maybe that's why he did it."
The Assassination of Gianni Versace,"This. I would rather have opened with the Versace death and then gone all the way back to maybe after high school. It was fine to save the childhood stuff for the end as an explanation and to prove that he didn't lie about *everything*.  But the way it was written, I didn't understand why he killed Versace. Except for the one dream sequence, it didn't appear that they had any real connection. They went on one weird date where he sat in the opera alone while Gianni was backstage. They had a chat afterwards, no details on how intimate they got. And then ... nothing. Versace had a long term partner. They both had flings on the side, but it wasn't even clear that Andrew was one of those."
The Assassination of Gianni Versace,Nah I loved the way it went backwards tbh. Was unique and wasn't too hard to piece together. Also as some others said it works out better in terms of how you judge Cunanan.
The Assassination of Gianni Versace,"I did as well.  Mainly because Darren Criss absolutely killed it in the role.

Both seasons are excellent though."
The Assassination of Gianni Versace,2nd was much better
The Assassination of Gianni Versace,"I thought it was *far* better. I felt like I knew that characters, and the   backdrops were just amazing. Everything about it was perfectly convincing it was shot back in the 90s... and the casting was incredible."
The Assassination of Gianni Versace,Yeah I haven't even watched the first season cuz that whole situation is already so well known and overdone. I didn't even know Versace was killed tho so I went in curious to what they'd say about it and it blew me away. While the pacing may be a bit slow at times that's my only criticism. Everything else was super well done. 
The Assassination of Gianni Versace,Thank you!!
The Assassination of Gianni Versace,"Also, because these shows are based on actual events, and in order for the show to maintain credibility, you can only delve so far into the fantastical.  That's a limitation Murphy doesn't have when it comes to something like AHS, and that's something I feel has worked to the show's detriment.  "
The Assassination of Gianni Versace,[deleted]
The Assassination of Gianni Versace,"If you like low budget college musicals, his starring role as the boy who lived in A Very Potter Musical is fantastic and on YouTube. A Very Potter Sequel is even better. 

Their legitimately great musicals as well. The songwriting is fantastic and the performances are great. 

I need to rewatch those. "
The Assassination of Gianni Versace,"That's probably a good thing lol Most people know him from Glee, because his character on there was very popular, and while he was good on Glee, one of the best they had, imo, he sometimes gets judged for that before people actually watch him in something, like ""lol, Glee. How good can he be if he was *Glee*?"" you know?"
The Assassination of Gianni Versace,"I don't think that no matter what he was supposed to be sympathetic.  If (and big if) his upbringing was portrayed correctly, I can see how he ended up this way.  "
The Assassination of Gianni Versace,There’s a difference between not really caring about whether what you wear is fashionable and straight up hating fashion. It’s just weird but doesn’t harm anyone I guess so w/e
The Assassination of Gianni Versace,"There are plenty of people who are molested  and don't turn out to be psycho killers. I thought it was a fairly weak explanation, though some people just have broken brains and you're not gonna get a ""good"" explanation."
The Assassination of Gianni Versace,"Agreed. I don’t think it held up to the OJ season, but it was very good and Darren Criss was excellent."
The Assassination of Gianni Versace,"Yeah, there was discussion a week or so ago about American Crime Story.  Everyone seems to prefer OJ, and I understand that, but to my surprise, this topped it, IMO.  It probably had to do with the fact that this case wasn't nearly as well known as OJ's, but it really touched on the personal stakes.  I really appreciated how the showrunners wanted to depict Cuananan as a monster, hence the telling of the story in reverse chronological order.  The penultimate episode, where he goes to the Phillipines to confront his father, is one of the best episodes of TV I've seen in recent memory.  Stellar performances from both.  If you think nothing will top OJ, I strongly advise you to give this a look."
The Assassination of Gianni Versace,I used to watch Darren Criss on glee and he wasn’t even in my top 5 of best actors on the series. But I remember watching this miniseries wondering “that’s the same guy????” His acting was fucking great. Even Ricky Martin deserved that Emmy nomination. It’s pretty difficult to live up to that OJ one but Darren carried that motherfucker on his back. The shirt that he wears should have won an award
The Assassination of Gianni Versace,[removed]
The Assassination of Gianni Versace,I like this series because the story unfolded in reverse. If you miss an episode you'll be lost.
The Assassination of Gianni Versace,Where’s the American Crime Story season about the guy who made the Hollywood sign say “Hollyweed”? That’s what I wanna know.
The Assassination of Gianni Versace,"I loved how this season showed the impact a poor childhood can have. Not that it’s an excuse for what he did, but the more you learn about his upbringing, his dad, his family dynamic, etc. the guy begins to make a little more sense.  Maybe I was going through something in life the first time I saw it but I just find it an incredibly sad story of how upbringing impacts you down the road and all your little insecurities."
The Assassination of Gianni Versace,I recently watched it as well. Darren Criss was amazing but I found it dragged a little. Could have probably cut an episode or two. Still a great series and a must watch.
The Assassination of Gianni Versace,"Criss was the best part of it, hands down. It was interesting to me the actual structure of the show and how it effectively worked backwards before returning to the ""present"". I don't think it nailed all the beats it was going for, and I know a ton of it is just full-on made up (the disclaimer at the end of each episode), but still definitely worth the watch for Criss' eerie performance."
The Assassination of Gianni Versace,"The two seasons of ACS are written/directed by different teams (aside from Ryan Murphy directing the first episode of *AoGV),* so they're not *really* the same show. 

I very much enjoyed it—much more than the OJ season, but I'm **really** into British crime dramas.  And the screenwriter, Tom Rob Smith, is British and also wrote the BBC Two series [*London Spy*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O1PEQkpKTLI) and [*MotherFatherSon*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fn87RhvtG5Y)."
The Assassination of Gianni Versace,I thought it was phenomenal.
The Assassination of Gianni Versace,it was so well done
The Assassination of Gianni Versace,Really great show to binge on netflix not sure if I would have been able to follow the timeline week to week.
The Assassination of Gianni Versace,I'm in the vast minority I'm sure but it's honestly my favorite television ever.
The Assassination of Gianni Versace,It was good but should have been a shorter series.
The Assassination of Gianni Versace,I think it was much less engaging than the first season. And near the end of the show everything felt like it dragged forever and the timelines were weird.
The Assassination of Gianni Versace,"I felt so uncomfortable watching it. Which I guess was the point.

But I was also a bit surprised because I thought the series would deal with the manhunt but its focus was mainly with Andrew Cunanan. 

And I agree that the OJ season was better."
The Assassination of Gianni Versace,"Yeah, like I vaguely remember this happening, but I had no idea it was a serial killer that was on the loose in Miami. Andrew was an interesting dive into an unknown abyss and Darren Criss's performance gave me Chernobyl levels of anxiety and dread."
The Assassination of Gianni Versace,Apparently they used the timeline out of chronological order because they didn’t want to seem like they were justifying the crimes or allowing the audience to feel sympathy for Cuananan.
The Assassination of Gianni Versace,Interesting. Can you explain why?
The Assassination of Gianni Versace,I’d be happy with a 3 20 minute episodes
The Assassination of Gianni Versace,"Yeah, I didn’t think of that but that’s true. It’s mainly from his POV. I’m really looking forward to the Impeachment season. Was disappointed they canceled their plans to do Hurricane Katrina."
The Assassination of Gianni Versace,You do know that the Netflix production was incorrect right?
The Assassination of Gianni Versace,Did you read the book? Totally different from series?
The Assassination of Gianni Versace,He liked the perfume tribute to her dead mom
The Assassination of Gianni Versace,There's another season? I didn't know. Thanks for the heads up👍
The Assassination of Gianni Versace,Looking forward to this. The first season was so compelling.
The Assassination of Gianni Versace,Cruz is an absolutely superb casting choice for that role.  
The Assassination of Gianni Versace,I'm a huge Darren Criss fan from all the way back in the Very Potter Musical days so I'm stoked to see him given this opportunity. I hope he steps up to the plate and gives a hell of a performance!
The Assassination of Gianni Versace,Looking forward to this.  Can't wait to see Criss in something that's not Glee.
The Assassination of Gianni Versace,Penelope's accent is pitch perfect for Donatella. 
The Assassination of Gianni Versace,"Doesn't look as interesting as OJ was, but in fairness that's an impossible standard to set. Still looking forward to this."
The Assassination of Gianni Versace,Someone is getting an Emmy.
The Assassination of Gianni Versace,[deleted]
The Assassination of Gianni Versace,The first season was amazing but I feel like this one could go either way depending on how involved Ryan Murphy is. Will definitely give it the benefit of the doubt though.
The Assassination of Gianni Versace,what happened with american crime story of Hurricane Katrina ?
The Assassination of Gianni Versace,Can't wait!
The Assassination of Gianni Versace,cant wait!
The Assassination of Gianni Versace,"I really need to finish OJ before this comes out! It looks super interesting, I'm excited."
The Assassination of Gianni Versace,"Have very little clue about the people involved other than knowing they’re fashion designers so hopefully it helps the viewing experience. Seeing Cuba as OJ last year was distracting even if I liked the series overall. I’ve just seen too many real life OJ interviews. 

Cruz looks compelling here. "
Robin Hood: Schlitzohr von Sherwood,"Used to love this as a kid, the music by Clannad worked so well. It was never the same when they replaced Michael Praed’s Robin with Jason Connery though. Praed wanted to quit so a replacement was needed but they chose poorly."
Robin Hood: Schlitzohr von Sherwood,"I first saw this series around 1989-1990, I think it aired on USA PBS stations. IMO it was and is easily the best ""Robin Hood"" adaptation on the large or small screens. Took the slightest dip when Sean Connery's son replaced the original Robin Hood actor, but just the slightest."
Robin Hood: Schlitzohr von Sherwood,"They did an audiobook story extension a few years back with many of the original cast members involved. I was lucky enough to have been asked to contribute some lines as background characters. Check it out if you’re looking for a fix, appreciate its not TV but it’s another story at least. 

https://www.thedreamcage.com/2015/09/audio-robin-of-sherwood-knights-of.html?m=1"
Robin Hood: Schlitzohr von Sherwood,"The Brother Cadfael series is a fairly close match to your wish, but with a bit less swords and horses."
Robin Hood: Schlitzohr von Sherwood,"This show was a little before my time. But I watched it years later due to having some interest in the stories. It seemed to take a lot of inspiration from the 1981 film Excalibur. Especially when it got into the mystical stuff.

Spoilers in case anyone cares for a show this old. The second Robin Hood was actually Sean Connery's son.  I also heard there was another Robin Hood show in the 2000s, but never saw it."
Robin Hood: Schlitzohr von Sherwood,"It was a part of my childhood as well, which is exactly why I hope it never gets remade/rebooted. I would like a new show with a similar vibe, just not another Robin."
Robin Hood: Schlitzohr von Sherwood,"Wow, a reboot of a classic show I remember from my childhood. What a brilliant idea.
I can’t see how this could possibly be ruined by modern TV or streaming companies. In fact based on all the amazing ideas brought up just in this thread I think it will be the greatest show ever made. 

Now I must go and get this gaping head wound checked."
Robin Hood: Schlitzohr von Sherwood,"Maybe it's the fog of age, but I recall the great soundtrack.  Together, we."
Robin Hood: Schlitzohr von Sherwood,"Haven't rewatched it recently, but as a kid I absolutely loved the BBC Robin Hood series featuring Jonas Armstrong"
Robin Hood: Schlitzohr von Sherwood,"it's time for a great reboot where Maid Marian becomes the new Robin Hood, but better"
Robin Hood: Schlitzohr von Sherwood,"You are absolutely right regarding Clannad, btw. Im fact, I'd even say that the songs and sound sequences they produced for the show were absolutely defining. I'd be hard pressed to think of another show whose music was so much part of its identity. For me, the Normans-theme alone (""Strange Land"") is similarly iconic as the Imperial March or the Terminator theme."
Robin Hood: Schlitzohr von Sherwood,"True, Connery was a bad replacement. The show, however, maybe even became better, all in all, in season 3. Good scripts, better action scenes and slightly higher production values. A shame they couldn't continue with Praed, they probably would have gotten an additional season with him.

Just started rewatching after 10 years, maybe I'll try my hand at writing the reboot I wish for for myself 😄"
Robin Hood: Schlitzohr von Sherwood,"Yes, I watched it on Oregon Public Broadcasting back in high school, probably 87 -88 I think.  

Great atmosphere and vibe."
Robin Hood: Schlitzohr von Sherwood,"Thanks, I'll check it out. 👍

But still, I say the world is ripe for a *good* new incarnation of Robin Hood.
In my childhood and youth, Robin was always around and a significant influence, in three different versions. In Kindergarten, I loved the Disney film. In primary school, it was Robin of Sherwood (nothing ever came close!), and in high school, the Kostner movie was a cultural event.

And today? Flop after flop. The film with Russell Crowe was pretty forgettable, and the one with Taron Egerton a major bomb. For 30 years, kids have grown up without a proper Robin Hood of their own... time for Herne and the Hooded Man to liberate them. :)"
Robin Hood: Schlitzohr von Sherwood,"The Robin Hood in the 2000s struggled a bit during the first season as they were trying to retell the classic stories. One they started to branch out from those stories, it really founds its feet. I highly recommend it. 

If you're in the UK, it's currently on iplayer"
Robin Hood: Schlitzohr von Sherwood,"But the look was much more dark, real and dirty than Excalibur. I wasn't happy with the extreme, chromy shininess and colourful light of that film, so I only watched it once. Didn't really connect with the story eiher.

Fun fact: Robert Addie, who plays Guy of Gisbourne in RoS, also plays Mordred in Excalibur."
Robin Hood: Schlitzohr von Sherwood,"I understand your concern. 
However, I think a new Robin series- if done well - would have so much potential, and not take anything away from the original.

A reboot would allow for more character-centered episodes and add longer-term storylines to the crisis of the week model of RoS. The seven swords of Wayland, for example, could be explored much further, as does the Herne mythos."
Robin Hood: Schlitzohr von Sherwood,"Don't want to further alarm you, but have your doctor check your irony gland, while he's at it. Looks like it might be hyperactive, from the outside.

Amazing ideas such as?"
Robin Hood: Schlitzohr von Sherwood,"No fog there, it was great indeed. ""Together we"" was one of the tracks used as a theme for the light-hearted moments with the gang in the forest or friendly scenes in the villages."
Robin Hood: Schlitzohr von Sherwood,I'll check it out.
Robin Hood: Schlitzohr von Sherwood,"I hope that trend will have run its course by then. 😏
But I was indeed also thinking about the possibility of adding more female characters. 
Always difficult, in a medieval setting. Changing olde England into an equal opportunity feminist utopia would ruin the atmosphere.
But then again, in hindsight, adding Marion to the core group was already very progressive by the showrunners, at least for the times. And the satanic nuns from season 2 made for great villains.

I'd probably give the Sheriff and Abbot Hugo a sinister sister who dabbles in dark magic and court intrigue.

A ruthless female cutthroat might be a believable addition to the Sherwood crew. Maybe a love interest for Will Scarlet.

On the celtic mysticism side, a druidic priestess might serve as an interesting counterpart to Herne, maybe adding a second, conflicting side to the more spiritual episodes."
Robin Hood: Schlitzohr von Sherwood,"For those who are too young to have this mystical masterpiece in their vaults

https://youtu.be/WorgQGCFeLM"
Robin Hood: Schlitzohr von Sherwood,"I think it's because the proper modern Robinhood is a series that's about the Crusades, where Robin is a subplot, kind of like a Game of Thrones thing."
Robin Hood: Schlitzohr von Sherwood,"Excalibur was slightly hammy, but great fun imo. In the words of Merlin 

"" A dream to some. 

A NIGHTMARE TO OTHERS !!!"""
Robin Hood: Schlitzohr von Sherwood,"The swords were frustrating for me as well, I was hoping to learn the whole story. I would watch a show developing the mystic aspect of RoS for sure."
Robin Hood: Schlitzohr von Sherwood,Thanks! I remember one used as a tension builder before and during battle. Tried to find it on YouTube but was unsuccessful. These were memories from when I was a child so I don't have much context to search.
Robin Hood: Schlitzohr von Sherwood,"You think everything needs to be ultra-epic and on a global scale? Hmm. Maybe politically, with lots if scenes showing the corrupt politics at court, beyond Nottingham. But actually showing the crusades would be too wide a focus, and too expensive."
Robin Hood: Schlitzohr von Sherwood,"You'll find all songs on the album ""Legend"" by Clannad."
Robin Hood: Schlitzohr von Sherwood,"I actually think the problem is that a modern Robinhood TV series has too *little* going on. 

It would make a great mini-series, but it would either get too soapy or too samey or jump the shark after 1.5 full seasons.

But it a broader period series, the Robinhood focused-episodes would be the most anticipated ones of the season."
Robin Hood: Schlitzohr von Sherwood,"Interesting point. I'm just rewatching RoS and I guess I see what you mean. However, I think the concept could still work if it was heavily expanded in the right directions. The Carpenter series took a lot of liberties itself, and these additions were among what I liked best about the show. Robin being the agent of a pagan god. Seven magic swords. A Saracen dual-wielder. Pightish barbarian shamans.

You could add much more in a similar vein to the mix, turning Sherwood Forest even more into a bit of a pagan fantasy world and merging Arthurian aspects into the Robin character."
Robin Hood: Schlitzohr von Sherwood,[Episode 1](https://youtu.be/w3KenQcX79M) is free to watch. Rest requires YouTube Premium.
Robin Hood: Schlitzohr von Sherwood,FF7 vibes
Robin Hood: Schlitzohr von Sherwood,Such a British show. It could be very serious at times and then turn around and be super silly. One episode actually ends with the heroes jumping up in the air in celebration and then being freeze framed.
Robin Hood: Schlitzohr von Sherwood,"I rewatched this recently, Robin Hood and Merlin both really capture the time they were made and the way the BBC did things.

They're both kind of ridiculous but a lot of fun, neither got great endings but they hadn't gotten stale either."
Robin Hood: Schlitzohr von Sherwood,"My sister and I LOVED this show in high school!

Me: ""So who do you have a crush on?""

Sis: ""Robin, duh.""

Me: ""Oh yeah, Jonas Armstrong is so fine -""

Sis: ""No, I like *Robin,* the character, idgaf about the real guy.""

She was the same way with the character Captain Jack Sparrow lol; I daydreamed about meeting Johnny Depp, she wanted to be whisked away on a pirate ship."
Robin Hood: Schlitzohr von Sherwood,"loved that show, so did my kids. too bad for the ending but it was time."
Robin Hood: Schlitzohr von Sherwood,Great series but season 3 was quite disappointing.
Robin Hood: Schlitzohr von Sherwood,">“Everyone was hearing about Robin Hood,” says Jonas Armstrong. “I was keen to get a meeting, maybe for Will Scarlet or Alan-a-Dale. I was 25! When my agent called to say ‘Jonas, you’ve got an audition for Robin Hood’, I thought okay cracking, who’s it for? My agent said “Robin Hood” – I laughed and said ‘no, who’s it for?’.

>“I’d always wanted to do Robin Hood,” Foz Allan says. “The great thing about legends full stop is that they are completely adaptable to their time. That’s why they remain legends: you bring them back and back because they say something for you.”  
>  
>“Errol Flynn’s Robin Hood represents the triumph of the individual over the Nazi horde,” Allan suggests. “An aging Sean Connery and Audrey Hepburn, tired and stuck in the woods asking what they’re doing – that’s America coming out of Vietnam. The 1980s one of my youth \[ITV’s Robin of Sherwood\] was devoutly and dedicatedly spiritual in the middle of Thatcherism, which was overtly profoundly materialistic. Today, you might do a kind of Brexit-fractured England – or you might do some plague stories.”  
>  
>...  
>  
>In August 2006, it was reported that four tapes of footage from the series had been stolen from the studio in Hungary – throwing schedules into disarray, risking missed production deadlines. (It was rumoured, though never confirmed, that a ransom had been issued for their return.) Ultimately, local police recovered the tapes by early September.  
>  
>“The tapes were stolen. The tapes were returned. I think one guy went to prison for it,” says Foz Allan, still speaking carefully about what happened. “The tapes were buried in black plastic bags covered in cinnamon – the bad guys apparently believed that dogs couldn’t smell tape if cinnamon disguised the scent.”  
>  
>“It wasn’t a publicity stunt, which was reported a lot of the time,” continues Allan. “It was very emotionally harrowing. Because we were the first High Definition show filmed outside of the UK for British television, we only had one High Definition machine – when the tapes disappeared, we hadn’t copied and duplicated as you normally would.”  
>  
>“We were looking at getting everybody to reshoot significant amounts of what they’d done. It would’ve been difficult, and we wouldn’t have been able to deliver the show \[in time\]. It was a hit before it arrived, in the sense that BBC Worldwide had already sold it to quite a lot of territories – so not being able to meet those deadlines would have been emotionally distressing.”  
>  
>Nonetheless, Armstrong remembers the production fondly. “There weren’t any fallouts between the cast, which is rare over a three-year period, filming that intensely. The friendships that were forged – without sounding cliché – became like a family. Because you are family, when you’re away from home over seven months at a time.”

>“I’m immensely proud of it now,” says Minghella. “It’s never a good idea to look online and see what people are saying about where you’ve been, but I stumbled across several groups who follow Robin Hood and for a good chunk of people it’s still alive.”  
>  
>“As Foz and I used to say, it’s for this generation, we want them to remember it and love it and own it as theirs,” he continues. “The love we put into it seems to be appreciated, which – having given years of your life to something, not seeing your family and your kids because you really wanted to create something that resonated – is just really, really gratifying.”

Fifteen years. Time flies."
Robin Hood: Schlitzohr von Sherwood,I remember this show. I liked it when I was a kid but Christ it is bad.
Robin Hood: Schlitzohr von Sherwood,I binged this show before. So bad that it's good. Cheesy medieval show. Low budget. Good soundtrack
Robin Hood: Schlitzohr von Sherwood,I remember fondly watching this as a kid. I can still hum the opening credits theme.
Robin Hood: Schlitzohr von Sherwood,I was 14 when I first saw this show. It’s is where I first saw Richard Armitage and fell in love with him 😍
Robin Hood: Schlitzohr von Sherwood,It got really silly near the end.  Enjoyable watch though.
Robin Hood: Schlitzohr von Sherwood,"> It could be very serious at times and then turn around and be super silly

I remember one episode that dealt with someone coming back from the Crusades and dealing with PTSD.  He was wearing modern day forest camo and combat boots"
Robin Hood: Schlitzohr von Sherwood,Fifteen years?  How about 65 years since The Adventures of Robin Hood starring Richard Greene?  Now that is time flying.
Robin Hood: Schlitzohr von Sherwood,"I loved this show. When it aired, it was probably one of my favorite shows on air.

I tried to rewatch it a few years ago and couldn't make it through the first episode.

Lesson learned: sometimes nostalgia should be left alone."
Robin Hood: Schlitzohr von Sherwood,"I think this is when Much is having a bath after he and Robin returns. He begins to think back and we hear the sounds of the battlefield and he begins to cry until Robin bursts in and gets his things to go do whatever and it's back to normal. 

Its a small scene but it's probably my favourite."
Robin Hood: Schlitzohr von Sherwood,"The very last couple seconds of Season 1 made me absolutely petrified with how awkwardly embarassing it was.

Otherwise this show is kickass :D"
Robin Hood: Schlitzohr von Sherwood,"I am on Season 3 and have been watching this with my girlfriend for the past year (we watch it when there is nothing else). Season 2 so far was awesome, and we had a marathon and wathced like 7 episodes one day. Season 3 is getting better after the first couple of episodes.


Love this show and recommend it!"
Robin Hood: Schlitzohr von Sherwood,"Also, Netflix has it commercial free."
Robin Hood: Schlitzohr von Sherwood,"Clannad, cringe-inducing?"
Robin Hood: Schlitzohr von Sherwood,Way back in Days of Old.. 
Robin Hood: Schlitzohr von Sherwood,"Too bad the show couldn't find an audience. Galavant had abysmal ratings last season and its renewal was easily the biggest shock of the year and the ratings have been considerably worse this season.

It's probably too much to ask for a second miracle renewal, but I'm still holding out hope.

Though anyone considering getting into Galavant should be glad to know that it does provide a very satisfying ending."
Robin Hood: Schlitzohr von Sherwood,"This show is a lot of fun.  Menken and Slater do the music.  Of course with three songs per episode over a 9-10 episode season not all of them are Tony winners but they are still bouncy and fun and move the plot along nicely.

Apart from the classic hero, Galavant, the other characters are interesting and well-defined - the King doesn't have any other skill besides being a king.  His wife, the Queen is the embodiment of evil and she's in love with the black-clad baddie brute Gareth.  Watching those two fall in love had me in stitches - particularly the pub scene on Gareth's birthday (you will recognize baddie as Vinnie Bruce the soccer hooligan from Eurotrip and other fine comedies).  I hope it sticks around for a couple seasons more.  I give it an 8/10 with most points for originality and comic writing."
Robin Hood: Schlitzohr von Sherwood,I like to think of it more like Princess Bride meets Spamalot.
Robin Hood: Schlitzohr von Sherwood,"If I could force any post to go front page it would be this one. The show is a perfect combination of humor and typically well done musical numbers. Season 2 struggled towards the end but the show is incredibly self aware and makes some pretty decent references to musicals and pop culture.

If Men In Tights and Monty Python are your thing Galavant is your thing as well."
Robin Hood: Schlitzohr von Sherwood,I thought season 2 was even funnier than season 1. Tad Cooper I super believe in you!
Robin Hood: Schlitzohr von Sherwood,"Love galavant, sad the season ended Sunday "
Robin Hood: Schlitzohr von Sherwood,"I usually dislike musicals, but this show is surprisingly funny with the songs. I'd definitely encourage anyone to check it out.

John Stamos was in the second episode and he really killed it."
Robin Hood: Schlitzohr von Sherwood,"I've never been into musicals and watched this show cold. I was pretty pissed when they didnt stop singing.  Now, two seasons in, i absolutely fucking love this show, singing and all.  "
Robin Hood: Schlitzohr von Sherwood,That was glorious! How can i witnesd more of this opus of magnificence!!??
Robin Hood: Schlitzohr von Sherwood,Seen. I like it.
Robin Hood: Schlitzohr von Sherwood,I stumbled on this show and enjoyed the episode that I saw! I can never watch it on ABC though... I always seem to miss it.
Robin Hood: Schlitzohr von Sherwood,"I like Timothy Omundson and some of the characters were decent(especially Madalena) but the show lacked stakes, it was just one thing after another. On many other shows you'd expect the main character to not die forever but it wouldn't have felt so inconsequential as on Galavant."
Robin Hood: Schlitzohr von Sherwood,Really short giants fighting really tall dwarves.  Classic.
Robin Hood: Schlitzohr von Sherwood,The first season was much better than the second. 
Robin Hood: Schlitzohr von Sherwood,I thought last season was better. It's alright but if they somehow got a 3rd season I'd pass on it.
Robin Hood: Schlitzohr von Sherwood,"I really wanted to like this show, for the very reason that it looked like a Mel Brooks work, or Princess Bride type of comedy. Unfortunately I felt it lacked any of the charm that any of those works have. Some of the songs were good, but the humor came across very forced. Feel free to downvote my opinion. I'm not proud of not liking it, maybe I'll give it a second shot."
Robin Hood: Schlitzohr von Sherwood,"I enjoyed it to some degree, but it was way too much singing for me and my girlfriend."
Robin Hood: Schlitzohr von Sherwood,"I tried watching the first episode but couldn't get past the fact that there was only one song that they just kept rolling back into.  
I was expecting something more than one or two variations on a theme, I think. It sounded like a a Joss Whedon fan's idea of a musical, four chords and a working knowledge of the maj. pentatonic scale. "
Robin Hood: Schlitzohr von Sherwood,"Adults who are mentally regressed, or who just want to admit their humor has been stuck at 14, check this out -- assuming your Mommy and Daddy are in bed.

(Actual 14 year olds -- do not do this!!)

Show could have been great -- but is instead reduced to the level portended by movies like Idiocracy and magezines like Mad.

It sucks."

It's even meta enough to tell you how satisfying it will be.
"
Robin Hood: Schlitzohr von Sherwood,I really love this show and had no clue that it's second season already aired.
Robin Hood: Schlitzohr von Sherwood,I didn't even know the second season had started yet. I enjoyed the first one maybe they should of advertised a little more.
Robin Hood: Schlitzohr von Sherwood,"I would say that Richard and Gareth were my two main reasons for watching the show, the two played off each other so well."
Robin Hood: Schlitzohr von Sherwood,"> This show is a lot of fun.


This show is like freebasing pure, uncut, Colombian fun "
Robin Hood: Schlitzohr von Sherwood,Only seen 4 episodes of season 1. Need more Stamos.
Robin Hood: Schlitzohr von Sherwood,It even shouts out to both
Robin Hood: Schlitzohr von Sherwood,"Gonna steal that, if you don't mind. Probably even if you do mind. "
Robin Hood: Schlitzohr von Sherwood,"he made a hilarious cameo in the second season too
"
Robin Hood: Schlitzohr von Sherwood,Seeing Stamos drunkenly vomit through his helmet's visor is still the hardest a show/movie has made me laugh since I first saw it last year. 
Robin Hood: Schlitzohr von Sherwood,It's all on Hulu!
Robin Hood: Schlitzohr von Sherwood,But Galavant did die this season
Robin Hood: Schlitzohr von Sherwood,I thought that for maybe the first two episodes of season two but after that it rebounded and had an amazing ending.  
Robin Hood: Schlitzohr von Sherwood,"I thought the second season was better than the first. Better songs, a more interesting plot, character development... 

Yeah, 2nd season > 1st season."
Robin Hood: Schlitzohr von Sherwood,"I would say season 1 had better music, but season 2 had the better plot. "
Robin Hood: Schlitzohr von Sherwood,"I gave ya an upvote, but I respectfully disagree. I think it has as much charm as Python and PB. The humor is also just as goofy and absurd; that's different than ""trying to hard"". That being said, I can certainly see why some might not like it on first viewing. Give it another shot; you may warm up to it. "
Robin Hood: Schlitzohr von Sherwood,I agree with you. I love most musicals and humor like Mel Brooks but I thought this show was terrible. I didn't find it funny very funny and I didn't like the songs. I was very surprised that it got a second season.
Robin Hood: Schlitzohr von Sherwood,"They filmed the whole thing in 2 months, and had to get through 32 songs - they have to keep them simple."
Robin Hood: Schlitzohr von Sherwood,You should have kept watching.  That first song was used a lot in the first episode but barely touched on after and there were plenty of great songs.

[More info on the tax credit](http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/abcs-galavant-pilot-nabs-new-667265). The article also helps explain why they always show two episodes back-to-back... the tax credit is only given to shows more than a half-hour in length."

Robin Hood: Schlitzohr von Sherwood,King Richard is like the Prince Zuko of Galavant
Robin Hood: Schlitzohr von Sherwood,"He was The man this season. The season was probably worse than S01. The songs in the last two ep. were not good, even Chef was not fun and he always made me laugh. Can't forget how he told Richard that he has killed all of his family. That was a funny bit."
Robin Hood: Schlitzohr von Sherwood,"I was surprised to learn that he was the only American on the whole cast, either he has an excellent accent or I just can't tell the difference."
Tango,"I don’t think there are any actresses who can play Morticia better than Anjelica Huston, but I think Catherine Zeta-Jones will do an excellent job. The whole cast in general looks soooooo promising. The fact that Cristina Ricci is so heavily involved gives me high hopes."
Tango,Her kill scene in X? 😲
Tango,When does this thing premier?
Tango,"Seems like everyone is praising Ortega and I'm very happy for her, one of the newest scream queens.     
Have high hopes for it, hope it's equally fun and spooky."
Tango,She looks like a young Aubrey plaza.
Tango,She's come a long way since her Disney Channel days.
Tango,Hey is that Luiz Guzmán? I loved him innnnnnnnnn IMDB
Tango,"Excited to see Fred Armisen as... ""Uncle Fenster"""
Tango,"She seems pretty perfect as Wednesday.  I generally don't get super-geeked for Tim Burton stuff these days, as a lot of it feels like goth flash over substance, but this one looks fun."
Tango,"Catherine Zeta-Jones, she dips beneath the lasers…"
Tango,"There will never be a better gomez and morticia than Raul and Angelica. 

They were the absolute apex of great casting."
Tango,"Aubrey Plaza also would have made an amazing Wednesday Addams as a child. 

Heck in 20 years she could rock Morticia. She’s awesome."
Tango,[deleted]
Tango,r/WednesdayNetflixTV for episode discussions
Tango,"I watched the series straight through this weekend.
Ortega and cast, are way too god damn old... 

How is everyone so blinded by this? All those kids looked (and they are) 20-22 years old."
Tango,Netflix will be back on top with original content such as this!!!
Tango,">The series begins with Wednesday as a public school outcast who learns her brother Pugsley (Isaac Ordonez) is being bullied and responds with an elaborate and potentially deadly prank against the water polo team.

Reverse that intro and have Wednesday being bullied and Pugsley ""prank"" the girls swim team. Have the piranhas attack one of the girls, implying it basically shreds their genitals, then have pugsley say ""People like girl shouldn't be allowed to procreate""

See how that series goes...

*oh look at all the childish hypocrites"
Tango,"If the whole family is in it, how does it constitute a “spinoff”?"
Tango,Isn’t Gomez supposed to be handsome and suave? Why did they cast Luis Guzman?
Tango,The Tango.
Tango,"I'm still holding a grudge because she didn't get naked in ""X."""
Tango,"They went with Zeta-Jones?  Really?  That’s disappointing. Michele Rodriguez, Rosario Dawson, Vanessa Felito- where is the sultry, intelligent fem fatal foil for Guzmàn( it may be there).  I’m no casting director, and I honestly am not interested in slighting Ms. Zeta-Jones, however there is a pool of talent that needs exposure and have the chops to send this reboot in a fun direction.  Maybe next time.  Guess we’ll see."
Tango,Jenni ortega is annoying in anything she appears in...go back to disney
Tango,"Yeah, but can we get a Munsters series from Robb Zombie? I quite liked the one off, need more of it."
Tango,I feel like Monica Bellucci or Angelina Jolie could have also been a good fit. Tho Jolie’s acting can be pretty meh. Excited for this one actually. Even tho I prefer the film/series version of Gomez over the cartoon version. But you can never go wrong with Guzmán.
Tango,"noone could play these characters better than those in the Sonnenfeld movies, that was literal perfect casting

I would maybe give Johnny Depp a chance at Gomez, but Julia was timeless"
Tango,Wednesday
Tango,Next Wednesday!
Tango,And altogether ooky.
Tango,"I have high hopes for her too! She has been great in everything I’ve seen her in, so excited for her success!"
Tango,My absolute lowest is a little bit better CW so if it's better than that I'm happy :D.
Tango,Well that was a disaster
Tango,"He's creepy, but he also sells stolen goods"
Tango,Gimmedafuckinkeysyacocksuckerwhatdafuck
Tango,"I'm imagining the voice of Jackie Coogan's Uncle Fester (from the old TV show) saying ""M'scuzi!"""
Tango,Carolyn Jones is my Morticia.
Tango,Or Janet Snakehole
Tango,You know why.
Tango,Co-opted old IP (Addams Family) + influencer culture (Jenna Ortega) = easy views.
Tango,Is it me or did they take away what the Addams family is really about? And they took away so much from Wednesday’s character🤦🏾‍♀️
Tango,Hey. Never become a screenwriter ok 👍
Tango,"It's about Wednesday. From what I can tell, Gomez, Morticia, and Pugsley are really only in the first episode, as is Lurch. Fester also seems to have a minor role. Thing pops up once in a while."
Tango,Gomez isn’t particularly attractive in the original *New Yorker* cartoons. Having him be handsome and suave was something that originated with the first TV series and continued in the movies.
Tango,"There are many versions of the Adams Family, but as far as I’m aware the “only” version that portrays Gomez as “handsome and suave” were the two movies from the 90s. 

In all other versions, they were always meant to be “creepy-looking”, which probably works best with the overall aesthetic about this family being a bunch of frightening weirdos transplanted into a modern setting."
Tango,Are you saying that he isn’t?
Tango,Cast because he’s really talented .
Tango,Not really handsome. Look at the original comics.
Tango,"You shouldn't be getting downvoted, its an honest question that you wanted an answer to, whether or not you were sure that Gomez is supposed to be handsome."
Tango,"I don’t think you can do much better than Raul Julia, the actor from the 90s movies, so I guess it makes sense to try something different."
Tango,The way I see it is the show is about Wednesday and what kid doesn’t see there dad as kinda goofy and thinks there mom is the prettiest
Tango,Why are people downvoting this question?
Tango,why would Morticia be hispanic?
Tango,All of those choices would have been terrible.
Tango,He’s a very impressive actor.  I love that he came from humble beginnings and attended a community college.
Tango,"Jolie was fantastic in Changeling, but she can definitely be a little hit and miss."
Tango,Jonny Depp would just play johnny depp
Tango,"Man, if they didn't premier this show on a Wednesday the internet would have exploded, lol."
Tango,…My dudes
Tango,I know the name of the show. I want to know when it’s premiering.
Tango,Plus creepy and kooky.
Tango,I trust you. I’m not even going to pirate that reheated garbage.
Tango,better than Burton?
Tango,"I'm not sure if that's exactly how I'd describe John Astin, but then he's the one that was banging identical cousins and I'm not."
Tango,why is Morticia still a bombshell then?
Tango,They are not “trying something different” so much as being truthful to the original comics.
Tango,"The same was said about a John Astin. The casting is a little weird, no doubt. Everyone always says “it’s like the New Yorker cartoons”, and sure it is, but I mean Gomez has evolved massively as a character since then.  

Shit, just look at how much Wednesday has changed from the cartoons and even the old tv show. They’re basing her off the movies for sure."
Tango,I guess some people are really thirsty for Guzman
Tango,"The enticing connotation isn’t about a specific, it’s about the sensual. Mortician was the epitome of sensual."
Tango,Say’s you.
Tango,E Pluribus Anus!
Tango,I loved him innnnnnnn.. IMDb
Tango,He was truly streets ahead!
Tango,You get an award.
Tango,I still think it should’ve premiered closer to Halloween probably the 26th.
Tango,Reminds me of how Brooklyn 99 could have had it’s finale on 9/9 but they bumped it a week for a sports game
Tango,Yep. World hunger? Who cares? Does Wednesday premiere on a Wednesday? Everything is going to explode if it doesn't happen!
Tango,"Therapist: The point is you assaulted a girl and shower no remorse for your actions.. That's why you're her- 



Wednesday: She lost her clitty, I did the world a favor girls like her don't deserve to feel any kinda pleasure. I've answered all of your questions."
Tango,I tolerate no slander of any of Sean Astin’s three dads. John Astin was sexy af as Gomez.
Tango,Because you can’t have unattractive women in movie/TV roles in the United States.
Tango,"Charles Addams had a very specific type of woman that he was into.  He married three tall women with black hair, modeled Morticia after his first wife.  His second wife took him for nearly everything he was worth.

https://observer.com/2006/10/his-wicked-way-with-women-addams-not-the-family-type-2/"
Tango,I almost puked when he smiled wide enough to see his gums.
Tango,When was Michele Rodriguez ever sensual?
Tango,Catherine Zeta-Jones has played sensual roles numerous times
Tango,Says the casting company.
Tango,That was **tragic.**
Tango,"This right here. Why are they premiering it right before Thanksgiving? 

The only reason I can think of is didn't they drop Sabrina right around Halloween? Or are they trying to invoke Christina's legendary camp Thanksgiving play from the movies?"
Tango,Maybe odd take but I don’t associate them with Halloween. They thrive off the comparison to normal people.
Tango,"I take offense to that! Slander is spoken, in print it's libel."
Tango,Ikr. More sullen than sensual.
Tango,"I think they figure it will be a family-friendly show for people to binge-watch over the long Thanksgiving weekend -- but I agree, expected it to drop weeks ago."
Tango,She needs to time things correctly to ambush Sarah Miller.
Tango,"Family date, but also: the show was shoot *extremely* close to areas of where the war in the Ukraine broke out (Ricci said by the time they left there were places under threat of bombing seven miles away) and I get the impression it was delayed a few weeks because of that."
Tango,"Probably because the two movies were released in November around now. (And maybe a little nod towards that glorious playhem.)

The animated ones were (early) October. I'll admit, I saw the first one, and found it perfectly enjoyable."
Tango,"I resemble such semantic tomfoolery! Nothing shall detract from my intolerance of any ills, spoken or printed, of any of Sean Astin’s three fathers! You force me to repeat myself; John Astin was sexy af as Gomez."
Tango,"Sure, but more because the charisma he put into the role. And he totally sold his complete adoration of Carolyn Jones. But let's be honest, [Desi Arnaz Jr didn't exactly inherit his parents' movie star looks, either.](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d5/Desi_Arnaz_Jr_-_The_Streets_of_San_Francisco_%281976%29.JPG)"
Tango,"Yup, you’ll get no argument from me there, and that’s actually kind of my point. I don’t think John Astin was particularly sexy when he *wasn’t* playing Gomez, and that’s part of what makes the character of Gomez so interesting for me. You can take an actor who isn’t exactly the standard of beauty, but if they play Gomez well, the character’s passion, his skill, his adoration for his wife, and the fact that he’s a great father, will make the *character* sexy, and this will often sort of rub off on the actor while he’s playing the part.

I think Gomez is one of the few characters I know of who has the power to make people attracted to his personality and as such make the man himself more attractive, in the same way that irl you can become attracted to someone who isn’t all that good looking because of the person they are."
Tango,Butter scene gonna be a whole episode now....yay🤷🏽
Tango,"It is going to be a series?

lordy."
Tango,..why? for the abuse behind the scenes?
Tango,Because of the rape on camera?  Bunch of sickies.
RuPaul’s Drag Race: Untucked!,I really loved Love on the Spectrum!

RuPaul’s Drag Race: Untucked!,Was the rehearsal not eligible?
RuPaul’s Drag Race: Untucked!,this show is so well done and honestly made me more sensitive to folks on the spectrum. love to see it get recognition!
RuPaul’s Drag Race: Untucked!,"As a person with ASD, I found this show wildly offensive and exploitative. The tone of the whole show is basically “Look how funny it is when they struggle! We better zoom in closer on that.” 

Television really seems to struggle to realize that ASD representation does not mean giving us weird superpowers a la The Good Doctor, nor does it mean infantilizing us like Love On the Spectrum. Struggle and unique capability can coexist, and it can be represented in ways that seek both understanding and pride."
RuPaul’s Drag Race: Untucked!,"TIL 'Love On The Spectrum' is not a scripted show.

RuPaul’s Drag Race: Untucked!,Pink dollar?
RuPaul’s Drag Race: Untucked!,"Because drag queens are famously terrible actors? The absolute best, most successul examples are, what, Divine in Pink Flamingos or Rupaul in the Brady Bunch movie? Or more typically it's someone like Willam in a bit part on a Law & Order episode playing a junkie or a hotdog stand owner getting interviewed by the cops.

Hearing a drag queen got cast in a dramatic acting role in a major production is like hearing a famous Youtuber got cast. Doing what they do takes skill and talent, but those skills don't transfer over. Usually the best you can hope for is a competent performance where they don't embarrass themselves."
RuPaul’s Drag Race: Untucked!,"🙄

For the same reason Richard Simmons would be a stupid choice to be Batman."
RuPaul’s Drag Race: Untucked!,I think people assume that vocal complainers on SM = all comic fans.  They are not.  Marvel fans are people who enjoy reading sci fi/fantasy stories about people with wondrous abilities who try to make a difference in the world.  You don't have to be a billionaire engineer to enjoy Iron Man.  You don't have to be a furry blue teleporter to enjoy X-Men.  And you don't have to be a drag queen to enjoy stories about Shade.

RuPaul’s Drag Race: Untucked!,"Indeed. The character absolutely has fans call me including a few old white guys like me.

So if someone is insisting that they have heard nothing but negative shit about her, that tells me that they hang out in the most toxic and fucking insane places.  That and they actively ignore any good thing said about her for some reason.

And I think we can all figure out the fucking reason."

Cricket Fever: Mumbai Indians,"damn, does this mean ESPN+ is losing the IPL rights for America as well? If so is it going to Paramount+?"
Cricket Fever: Mumbai Indians,People really like cricket. This was a loss for Disney.
Cricket Fever: Mumbai Indians,IPL is fucking huge.
Cricket Fever: Mumbai Indians,"> MoffettNathanson analyst Michael Nathanson has cut his global subscriber target for Walt Disney streamer Disney+ below the company’s 2024 target range, citing the recent loss of the streaming rights for Indian Premier League (IPL) Cricket to Viacom18.


> “We now expect the company to come in below its 230-260 million guidance with 213 million as Disney+ Hotstar (in India) drops down to roughly a third of subs (versus the 43 percent estimate previously),” he wrote in a Friday report.


> Despite the lower Disney+ subscriber forecast, the Wall Street expert said his financial estimates for Disney’s direct-to-consumer (DTC) unit earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) actually improved, swinging to a fiscal year 2024 profit of $300 million from a forecast loss of $310 million. The driver: “removing our estimated jump in IPL costs needed to secure the rights.”

> Given the Indian cricket rights auction and Netflix’s recent subscriber losses, Wall Street observers have wondered if Disney, led by CEO Bob Chapek, may reduce its streaming user guidance for 230 million to 260 million subs by 2024. In May, Disney disclosed that it added 7.9 million subscribers in its last quarter to hit 137.7 million total."
Cricket Fever: Mumbai Indians,"So Disney won the television broadcast rights, while Viacom18 (jointly partnered with Paramount+) won the streaming rights. 

IMO over the long run Viacom18 got the better deal (they both cost a similar price), though only time will tell. India has a lot of mobile usage and the streming market could grow to the tens of billions over the next 5-6 years.

TBH, I think it would have been worth it for Disney to find a joint partnership to win the streaming rights as well, like Paramount did."
Cricket Fever: Mumbai Indians,"They haven't really lost rights to ""Indian Cricket"". They've only lost the rights to IPL which happens for two months in a year. They still have tons of Cricket rights involving the Indian and Australian teams to go round the year."
Cricket Fever: Mumbai Indians,"India's loss...now they're gonna miss ""I am Groot""..."
Cricket Fever: Mumbai Indians,[deleted]
Cricket Fever: Mumbai Indians,"LOL because of cricket? Yeah no, no one cares about cricket."
Cricket Fever: Mumbai Indians,"230 million subs by 2024 doesn't really seem realistic to me. They have 6 quarters to get 90 millions subs, or 10 if they actually meant by the end of 2024. That would mean they need to average 9 million or 15 million subscribers a quarter.


In the last 5 quarters, their average is 8,5. Or 8,7 in the last 10 quarters. And the higher they get the harder it should be to increase.


Obviously I have no idea what their plans are or I don't do any analysis on the market so I very likely am wrong, but to me their numbers don't really sound realistic, at least the way they are now. Even if they are Disney."
Cricket Fever: Mumbai Indians,"Wow, that's a substantial loss over just 1 piece of content"
Cricket Fever: Mumbai Indians,"IPL is huge though. A lot more ""viewer-friendly"" than Test cricket, that's for sure. Also attracts a lot of non-Indian talent."
Cricket Fever: Mumbai Indians,Nobody understands you sillies
Cricket Fever: Mumbai Indians,"A LOT of people like cricket. And the league they lost was one of the biggest cricket leagues. As cable continues to show, people subscribe literally just for sports."
Cricket Fever: Mumbai Indians,"India treats cricket like Europe treats soccer. You may not of heard of him, but Sachin Tendulkar is treated like a minor deity."
Cricket Fever: Mumbai Indians,30 year old series and sports are what *way* too many people subscribe to services for
Cricket Fever: Mumbai Indians,IPL isn't the only T20 Cricket that happens here. They literally have T20 World Cup at the end of this year. ODI World Cup next year. There are two other formats of Cricket that you are forgetting about.
Cricket Fever: Mumbai Indians,The money involved for not that many games per year puts it up there with the biggest sports rights in the world
Cricket Fever: Mumbai Indians,"Sure but when more than 1/3rd of world population watches the sport, the advertisement money is crazy"
Cricket Fever: Mumbai Indians,"If Amazon and Google join in on bidding for it, disney screw on keeping the rights for it."
Cricket Fever: Mumbai Indians,Loved it. Wait today??
Cricket Fever: Mumbai Indians,"I enjoyed it. Because of the different timelines, it's not a show you can have on in the background (even with dubs). It pays off, though.

A similar recommendation is Delhi Crime, based on the real life investigation of a gang rape. One season of 7 episodes. Rated 8.6 on IMDB and 91%/95% on RT."
Cricket Fever: Mumbai Indians,Crazy. Thought it was coming out tomorrow and then saw it’s out now. Buh bye life. Such a good show.
Cricket Fever: Mumbai Indians,That ending!!
Cricket Fever: Mumbai Indians,Does it feature any songs and/or hyper-kinetic editing?
Cricket Fever: Mumbai Indians,55 minutes from now. Will be out on 12AM IST.
Cricket Fever: Mumbai Indians,"No, it’s very different from your typical Bollywood stuff"
Cricket Fever: Mumbai Indians,"Pleasant surprise, starting that shit right meow"
Cricket Fever: Mumbai Indians,"""I think not being racist is the new racism."""
Cricket Fever: Mumbai Indians,"The movie was actually watchable (it's on netflix instant now)... the show is just trash.

Watch the movie, and even if you like the show, it's completely unwatchable after watching the movie. It treats the story with a lot more respect, and reality."
Cricket Fever: Mumbai Indians,"I think the show is much better than the movie, as well as every casting choice. Asha is smoking hot in the Show, and Rajiv's evilness is needed amongst the Cast."
Cricket Fever: Mumbai Indians,"Yeah, when the guy who moves to India DIDN'T KNOW THAT COWS WERE SACRED THERE, I checked out. I'm pretty sure I learned that in 3rd grade some time. 

I can buy that he didn't know much about the country before moving there--but not researching the place at all before you move there? WEIRD."
Cricket Fever: Mumbai Indians,The OA cancelation made me not too happy.
Cricket Fever: Mumbai Indians,"Lilyhammer, one of the first! Also personal fan of Hemlock grove"
Cricket Fever: Mumbai Indians,"My top 10

- 1st Dark

- 2nd Russian Doll

- 3rd The Queen's Gambit

- 4th Narcos

- 5th Stranger Things

- 6th Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency (BBC America coproduction)

- 7th The Woman in the House Across the Street from the Girl in the Window

- 8th Sense8

- 9th Unorthodox

- 10th Black Mirror (S1-S2 are from Channel 4, S3-S5 are Netflix Original)

My watchlist (what I'm going to watch next): Ozark, Inside Job, Godless."
Cricket Fever: Mumbai Indians,No love for the Mike Flanagan shows?
Cricket Fever: Mumbai Indians,"I think Netflix has really become disappointing in recent years. When they first got into original programming, they would develop these really amazing shows that were unlike anything else on television. But ever since they cancelled Sense8, they have started premiering more average programming. 

My favorite Netflix originals:

1. Bojack Horseman: Became one of my all-time favorite shows rather quickly and really revolutionised for me what adult animation can do. 6 almost flawless seasons and I think it should have gone one for 1-2 more seasons.
2. Orange Is The New Black: I am generally a huge fan of shows with female leads, and this was really one groundbreaking and entertaining show. I feel like its impact and popularity is almost forgotten by now, but I think it was one of the shows that really defined what streaming could do. I also think it found a great ending. 
3. Sense8: This was not a perfect show, but a beautiful concept, connecting people from different backgrounds and promoting international friendships, which few shows do. Additionally, it was pretty amazing to actually see a show shoot in all these different locations all over the world.
4. Glow: Again, I really love female-centred shows and this was no exception. Great performances by a great cast all around.
5. Russian Doll: Same as Orange Is The New Black or Bojack Horseman, I think Russian doll really drives home the fact that streaming services like Netflix can tell different stories from traditional outlets.
6. Tuca and Bertie: It died too sun on Netflix, but thank god it was revived on Adult Swim. Different enough from Bojack Horseman to stand on its own, but sharing a lot of the same sensibilities that made Bojack fun.
7. The OA: Again, this is not a perfect show for me, but what I really loved about this show was how different it was from your usual fare and how different the story was told. It felt more like a good book than a TV series, which many streaming series aspire to, but really actually achieve in doing.
8. Dead to Me: This show is not as great as many of the others, but the chemistry of the two leads is iressistible.
9. Stranger Things: A little bit overhyped, but creative.
10. Jessica Jones: My favorite of the Marvel shows. (Actually the only one I watched more than one season of.)"

Cricket Fever: Mumbai Indians,Iweather you have or have not watched bojack I urge you to reconsider
Cricket Fever: Mumbai Indians,">When They See Us

One of the hardest shows to watch. Damn I felt bad for them."
Cricket Fever: Mumbai Indians,Dark should be top this list
Cricket Fever: Mumbai Indians,"There are a lot more Netflix originals that I really like that unfortunately didn't make the list: Unorthodox, Mindhunter, The Queen's Gambit, Quicksand (Störst av allt), Unbelievable, Altered Carbon, Sintonia, Bridgerton, Easy etc.  
  
Also, as for other acquired/co-produced content that I chose to not put on the list: Alias Grcae, Kalifat, Parfum, La Casa de Papel, La cocinera de Castamar, Crash Landing on You etc. are all great television.  
  
*But anyways, since this is a pm\_me\_reason\_to\_livx list, ya kno what I gotta do....*

Cricket Fever: Mumbai Indians,OITNB is great. I watched the first 4 seasons.
Cricket Fever: Mumbai Indians,[deleted]
Cricket Fever: Mumbai Indians,I see you haven’t watched bojack horseman in my opinion that is the best Netflix original
Cricket Fever: Mumbai Indians,What's going on with that Master of None write up?
Cricket Fever: Mumbai Indians,[deleted]
Cricket Fever: Mumbai Indians,"Thanks, cool list! Some shows I havent heard before"
Cricket Fever: Mumbai Indians,I would say that Babylon Berlin and BoJack Horseman are the best.
Cricket Fever: Mumbai Indians,"Way late to this post but definitely recommend “the last kingdom” one of their best shows, just finished its last season and then will end with a movie. Also the show “russian doll” had a fantastic s1 and returns for s2 in 1 day, highly recommend that one as well, very quick watch too because it’s 30m episodes and only 8 per season."
Cricket Fever: Mumbai Indians,"Maid, Unbelievable and Mindhunter."
Cricket Fever: Mumbai Indians,I loved Hemlock Grove.
Cricket Fever: Mumbai Indians,"Lilyhammer was so good. But unfortunately it was cancelled too soon, the show does not have an ending :("
Cricket Fever: Mumbai Indians,I like The Haunting of Hill House a lot.
Cricket Fever: Mumbai Indians,"I've seen everyone of those besides Between, Helix and Cobra Kai. And I'm almost sure they're not Netflix originals."
Cricket Fever: Mumbai Indians,Bloodline season 1 was one of the best seasons of television I’ve ever seen. Unfortunately season 2 killed it and 3 buried it in an unmarked grave. Should have been a limited series.
Cricket Fever: Mumbai Indians,It's the reason why I haven't given it a rewatch yet. I just can't bare all that pain again.
Cricket Fever: Mumbai Indians,Ah feel ya. *But Desenfrenadas tho*.
Cricket Fever: Mumbai Indians,[deleted]
Cricket Fever: Mumbai Indians,"You know, 100+ Netflix series yet I've never actually seen House of Cards. lol. I must acknowledge it though because it's one of the most popular Netflix OGs. But personally, politics? Big *naaaaaaah* for me."
Cricket Fever: Mumbai Indians,Because it's bad
Cricket Fever: Mumbai Indians,I've watched Bojack Horseman.
Cricket Fever: Mumbai Indians,"*I don't know what they want from me, it's like... the more money we come across, the more problems we seeeeee!*"
Cricket Fever: Mumbai Indians,"lol, this comment. check some out tho."
Cricket Fever: Mumbai Indians,"One of the first chopping block regrets, but not the last"
Cricket Fever: Mumbai Indians,Between and Cobra Kai are Netflix originals. Helix is a cancelled Syfy series.
Cricket Fever: Mumbai Indians,I never plan to rewatch it. Ain't going through that again.
Cricket Fever: Mumbai Indians,"Yea I've seen Marco Polo. The closest thing to it I guess is Kingdom. Vikings Vanhalla is close to that time period as well, but I think it's *where* Marco Polo is set that makes it unique and not *when*."
Cricket Fever: Mumbai Indians,Man the first season is peak television
Cricket Fever: Mumbai Indians,"Great list----there are only six of the shows you listed, including Desafrenadas, that I've never heard of, but they definitely sound worth checking out because of your descriptions of them. Here's a couple of faves of mine on Netflix, some of which I didn't finish before they got taken off, and some I haven't finished yet, along with one I'd like to see, and haven't seen yet:

1.The Protector----a Turkish fantasy-thriller that lasted four seasons, with 10 half-hour episodes for each season. It's about a young guy who runs a shop with his father, who discovers after a tragedy that he's been chosen as the Protector, and that he's part of an ancient people with superpowers who fight the demons, called the Immortals, that are trying to take over the world. I've seen only one season so far, but it was pretty good, and fun to see a fantasy action series with a Turkish take on it.

2. Paranormal--- Netflix's second Middle Eastern series (after their first one, a Jordanian series called Jinn, which lasted one season). It's set in 1960s Egypt (where it was actually shot, because it's based on a popular series of horror books by an Egyptian author, Ahmed Tawfik.) It's about a hemotologist and college professor named Refaat Ismail who finds himself literally haunted by ghosts from his past, even tough he dosen't believe in the supernatural. He also finds himself caught up in a whirlwind of curses and supernatural terror anyway soon after he comes in contact with a mummy that he winds up stealing to de-curse it, along with another man who's trying to stop the mummy from cursing everything else around it. He, the dude trying to do the un-curses, and his crush, another professor named Maggie, wind up going to the desert, being chased by demon creatures and haunted by other things. Really fun and lively old-school show, only six episodes. It's supposed to get a second season later this year---I enjoyed the first season, so looking forward to the second.

Liked three of the Marvel shows----Luke Cage, Jessica Jones, and Daredevil---but my laptop conked out the same week all three shows were leaving Netflix for Disney Plus and I didn't get a chance to finish watching them, lol.

La Reina del Sur---a Mexican drama about a woman who winds up on the run after her drug dealer boyfriend is murdered to another country, where she winds up being too close to some more major drug and trying to keep her head above water. This long-running popular telenovela inspired a reboot of the series back around 2017, I believe, and an American version of the show called Queen of the South. It's very exciting and action-packed all way."
Cricket Fever: Mumbai Indians,"Cobra Kai wouldnt count for this list because the first season aired on youtube, i think"
Cricket Fever: Mumbai Indians,"For real-----even though I'm old enough to recall when the real case jumped off back in the day, and even after seeing the Ken Burns documentary that finally told the Central Five's side of their stories---When They See Us, which was very well made, was still difficult as hell for me to watch, knowing that these young boys--which is exactly all they were, no matter how demonized and hatefully stigmatized they were at the time, mainly because they were black---were going to jail and put through literal hell for a crime none of them committed. Yeah, they survived, but some of them still bear the scars of what they went through, and what it took to survive that, even today.

The second youngest of the Exonerated Five, as they now are able to call themselves, Yuself Salaam, wrote a book last year about his experiences called Bitter, Not Better: Living In The Pursuit Of Racial Justice, that's worth reading. Here's a review of it: [One Of The Falsely Accused Five Tells His Story](https://www.npr.org/2021/05/18/997792060/in-better-not-bitter-one-of-the-central-park-five-tells-his-own-story)"
Cricket Fever: Mumbai Indians,Actually a better comparison is Medici as a historical drama about real life characters and one I notice often gets left out of these discussions
Cricket Fever: Mumbai Indians,"I'm just saying that Cobra Kai is a Netflix original, I did  not say that Cobra Kai counts for OP list. It doesn't count because OP is excluding Netflix originals that did not start on Netflix, like Black Mirror."
Cricket Fever: Mumbai Indians,"Sure, just wanted to clarify that you guys seem to be operating under different definitions"
Cricket Fever: Mumbai Indians,"Not really, he said that those three shows are not Netflix originals, which is incorrect."
Cricket Fever: Mumbai Indians,Omg gonna watch it. Just checked it’s on Canadian Netflix 
Cricket Fever: Mumbai Indians,I absolutely love Netflix original international shows! Does anyone else watch it in the original audio with English subtitles? 
Cricket Fever: Mumbai Indians,We have a sub reddit at /r/Sacred_Games to keep the discussion going and share other content/info related to the show. Come join us!
Cricket Fever: Mumbai Indians,3 episodes in and i am absolutely hooked. It could be the best tv show to come out of India ever (I know that's not really a bar set very high lol)
Cricket Fever: Mumbai Indians,Binge watched whole season last night !!
Cricket Fever: Mumbai Indians,Pilot is fucking phenomenal! 
Cricket Fever: Mumbai Indians,">Religion is a massive fucking theme of the show

That's a big no no for me."
Cricket Fever: Mumbai Indians,"It's a Netflix Original series, like Narcos or House of Cards.

In case people thought that Netflix just bought the streaming rights"
Cricket Fever: Mumbai Indians,[deleted]
Cricket Fever: Mumbai Indians,I heard some original slang is lost with the subs but the show's still great. Do tell me when you try it !
Cricket Fever: Mumbai Indians,Maybe the only good show to come out of India
Cricket Fever: Mumbai Indians,"OP is exaggerating, the show is much more than that."
Cricket Fever: Mumbai Indians,It's not religious. Rather how religion is used in politics. 
Cricket Fever: Mumbai Indians,Don't mean shit in Australia. They sold season 5 rights of arrested development.
Cricket Fever: Mumbai Indians,[removed]
Cricket Fever: Mumbai Indians,We have a few more but majority of the shows are made only for indian homemakers who need to fulfill the drama of their lives
Cricket Fever: Mumbai Indians,Is it just me or is everything fucked in Australia? You hear people complaining that everything's so expensive... From broadband to PC parts and Netflix is also doing this...
Cricket Fever: Mumbai Indians,I think that's the production company's fault.
Cricket Fever: Mumbai Indians,"Ah shit, they did that here too D:"
Cricket Fever: Mumbai Indians,what else would you recommend? I can understand Hindi kinda well (not the regional languages though) so language isn't much of an issue. 
Cricket Fever: Mumbai Indians,isn't that Netflix? 
Cricket Fever: Mumbai Indians,I like breath and Lakhon main ek on amazon prime And Bose Dead/Alive is amazing. 
Cricket Fever: Mumbai Indians,I was mistaken. Netflix sold the rights before they planned to make Netflix available in Australia.

Diary Of Tootsies,"These people clearly didn't get enough shit for what they did to Kat Graham or they wouldn't have the nerve to give a puff piece interview about ""mistakes"" they made during TVD."
Diary Of Tootsies,Julie Plec sounds like a Julie Pliece of work.
Diary Of Tootsies,"The funniest thing was Julie being like “I would love a Bonnie spin off” and Kat Graham liking a tweet that basically called Julie a racist and told her to fuck off. 

Julie sucks but she’s very smart and knows when to jump on popularity. She sees Bonnie getting a lot of well deserved love online so she immediately jumps on “I’d love a Bonnie spin off” 

But then she immediately cancels it by then being like “I’d love another Alaric spin off” despite Matt Davis being a racist Trump supporter."
Diary Of Tootsies,What did they do to her?
Diary Of Tootsies,"Tbf this series is built on sexy looking asshole men.

Not that I dont love Bonnie though"
Diary Of Tootsies,Matt Davis is into Trump 🤢🤢
Diary Of Tootsies,"The primary things I heard were her character being given basically nothing to do, and when Kat asked to wear her natural hair instead of wigs like they had been making her to wear, she was refused."
Diary Of Tootsies,The thing is Legacies was technically an Alaric spin off. He did not need other spin offs. His knees barely worked on the show after Hope kicked his ass. He didn’t need another story when they ran out of shit to tell with him.
Diary Of Tootsies,"Feel like an interesting insight on how they approached the music in the video. A common criticism at least at reddit, is very much how the music doesn't match the overall setting. I personally love that they stuck with the choice they went. And looks like the writers are dedicated to this style of music choice."
Diary Of Tootsies,"Someone please recommend music that is similar to What Could Have Been with strong vocals, emotion, and a baller ass violin over the top. How the fuck is this song so good. It just builds up perfectly. The more I listen the more it becomes closer to my favorite song."
Diary Of Tootsies,"Music was one of the best thing in arcane. For me, it elevated some of the scenes to next level."
Diary Of Tootsies,"A shame they didn't touch on ""Guns for Hire."" I definitely think that was the standout song of the show."
Diary Of Tootsies,"[Showdown](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhSgvgfZ4Dw&t=0s) from the Act 2 finale gives me Duel of the Fates vibes.

The orchestral soundtrack is [phenomenal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TSuDmLyhzo), it's the [non-orchestral](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mXCX5PhL6s) tracks that divide people.

Overall I think it was far superior to Dune's OST which was utterly forgettable outside the excellent Sardukar chant."
Diary Of Tootsies,"Ramsey- Goodbye is such a kilelr song and it played on your emotions so well in ep. 3 credits.

Does anybody know if they released the full soudntrack on spotify?"
Diary Of Tootsies,"Most of the music is great, except for the tracks with vocals. Took me right out of my suspension of disbelief. Only reason I couldn't give it 10/10.



I also don't like Imagine Dragons."
Diary Of Tootsies,"That's the thing I disliked the most about it. It did nothing to story telling, and was very in your face."
Diary Of Tootsies,[deleted]
Diary Of Tootsies,"I really enjoyed the soundtrack so I was surprised when some people, even ones who liked the show, said it didn't work for them. 

I do think the majority liked it, though, and I'm glad they'll be sticking with that."
Diary Of Tootsies,"I personally didn't like the music as well. In the sense that I can't jam to it, but I thought it fit the scenes perfectly. It was beautifully choreographed and I felt like every beat and every scene that followed it was wonderfully done.

Just not my taste, but it definitely was well done and elevated the scene."
Diary Of Tootsies,"In case you haven't already, check our the ""the curse of the sad mummy"", also Riot games. It almost feels like what could have been was a more polished, more general interpretation of that song."
Diary Of Tootsies,"Same dude. Wish I did have a recommendation. I told my wife after listening to it “I need to learn violin.” Lol. I think the show, unfortunately, removes a large part of the violin solo!"
Diary Of Tootsies,"Wow I loved the dune ost, wtf? Everything was so alien yet also ancient sounding

Anyway I think the arcane music set pieces worked more often than not.  They were some of the best scenes most of the time, with exceptions for eps 4 5 and the first one in 7."
Diary Of Tootsies,"Yup. It's available at Spotify. 

https://open.spotify.com/album/3MdiH74FL8mhlbnR6DcqJd?si=OHxxK1j0STC2oUCVAuYNDg&utm_source=copy-link"
Diary Of Tootsies,It is. It’s also on Apple Music.
Diary Of Tootsies,No one likes imagine dragons. Literally no the worst part of an otherwise great show
Diary Of Tootsies,Really? You must not enjoy music much in general
Diary Of Tootsies,"At times I felt it was too much though, it felt like every episode had a musical montage with episode 5 being a musical video for Imagine Dragons for some reason. One of the few flaws the show had in my opinion."
Diary Of Tootsies,"Apparently, the guy who produced it, is the writer of Arcane."
Diary Of Tootsies,"Oh, that’s nice."
Diary Of Tootsies,You've seen the Game Awards version?
Diary Of Tootsies,I doubt there's was only 11 songs/themes in 9 episodes.
Diary Of Tootsies,This is one of their good ones tho. But I don't hate Imagine Dragons that much.
Diary Of Tootsies,">You must not enjoy music much in general

**WHY DONT PEOPLE LIKE THINGS I LIKE ??!!**"
Diary Of Tootsies,Yep. I also think he did the vocals on the song.
Diary Of Tootsies,I did! Loved it
Diary Of Tootsies,"if you ignore the OST background score besides the vocals, there are just 11 songs. They also did uploaded the OST to Spotify."
Diary Of Tootsies,"I’m sorry but saying music within a show “does nothing for story telling” can be argued in absolutely any movie or show. It adds to the emotional impact of scenes. 

Not to mention arcane boasted a wide variety of genres. If they found it all bad, I’m led to believe they don’t enjoy a lot of music."
Diary Of Tootsies,under what name?
Diary Of Tootsies,">I’m sorry but saying music within a show “does nothing for story telling” can be argued in absolutely any movie or show.

You can objectively point out if the music fit or didn't, but your little crybaby comment of ""***You must not enjoy music much in general***"" is something only said by hardcore fans that can't accept any criticism. It would be like arguing against a child. You're extremely biased from the start.

What a pathetically vocal fanbase of children that this extremely generic written show has."
Diary Of Tootsies,"https://open.spotify.com/album/36O80DdzP2pUvkPuKqmJ6H

Yeah, its confusing, I know."
Diary Of Tootsies,"So his comment was just an insightful opinion about music not matching the scene but mine is crybaby fanboyism? Nice logic there dumbass.

Also, you have some ego to claim you can decide if a SONG aligning with a scene OBJECTIVELY matches."
Diary Of Tootsies,">So his comment was just an insightful opinion about music not matching the scene but mine is crybaby fanboyism?

Let me fix that:

**My opinion is superior while other people are wrong, and anyone dislikes that, then that person is a dumbass for pointing out my hypocrisy.**

*Edit: I'm just blocking the crybaby. Good lord, what a loser fanbase.*"
Diary Of Tootsies,"Oh the idiocy is killing me… YOU are the one offended by a different opinion. 

He stated all the music in arcane was bad(his opinion), I said he must not enjoy a lot of music(my opinion). You are the person standing on the sidelines butthurt because you disagree with the way I stated my opinion. 

If you agreed with me you wouldn’t say shit,
Do you not see the irony of your statement? My hell."
Diary Of Tootsies,They basically dumped the 2nd season since they released to binge instead of a weekly release like the other shows…. And it’s a CBS production so no suprime at all
Diary Of Tootsies,"Awww, we didn’t really get anywhere with the brother."
Diary Of Tootsies,"Makes sense since they ddumped the second season, but from what I saw it took the most risks of the D+ originals. It was originally developed for the CW, and you don't see middle school shows show training bras and periods and stuff. Plus the brother possibly (?) being gay."
Diary Of Tootsies,"It's not surprising but I think it was a pretty good show actually. I'm not the target audience, but I enjoyed it for what it was. The A storyline with Elena as a middle schooler was pretty generic but the other stuff was good. The brother coming to terms with being gay and having feelings for a friend, and then Sam becoming a step dad and all those challenges."
Diary Of Tootsies,"Aww, I really enjoyed the brother and Sam becoming a step dad!"
Diary Of Tootsies,I’m sure all the 10 people who watched this are heartbroken
Diary Of Tootsies,This is so sad
Diary Of Tootsies,This sounds like Parks and Rec.
Diary Of Tootsies,"Fear the Walking Dead, Vikings"
Diary Of Tootsies,Coma seasons of Archer lost me for good. I know it's back on to the original setup but I just don't care anymore.
Diary Of Tootsies,"Did you watch the first three seasons of Arrested Development?  Because if so, that's all you need to watch.  The Netflix seasons are trash."
Diary Of Tootsies,*Whispers* I'm already getting a little bored with Poker Face.
Diary Of Tootsies,Sons of Anarchy
Diary Of Tootsies,"I never finished Grimm, Orphan Black, Black Sails, The L Word, The Originals, I also gave up on Lost. 

All of these shows I enjoyed for at least 3 seasons (except Black Sails, I stopped at 2.) but they started getting stale."
Diary Of Tootsies,"Twin Peaks has an incredible season 3 (The Return) but it's not a show for everyone. If you hated it immediately then don't bother, but if you were perhaps turned off by certain season 2 plot lines I'd vote to try and push through. Up to you though."
Diary Of Tootsies,"The Americans.  I have tried so many times to watch that show, probably watched the first 2 seasons 3 or 4 times.  I just could not keep going.  It's not bad, it just comes across as mediocre to me."
Diary Of Tootsies,"Legacies

A dude literally melted into goo after having sex…… plus one of the actors left and I stopped caring about it."
Diary Of Tootsies," at least 80% of those I watched in the last few years, too many to mention honestly. Exponentially more compared to the number I dropped during the 35 years before"
Diary Of Tootsies,The Wilds on Amazon prime. The guys made it weird. Plus I heard sad news ab my fav girls
Diary Of Tootsies,A new one just came out - *Hunters*. Went through 9.5 episodes just to find out I never should have started it.
Diary Of Tootsies,"What We Do in the Shadows

The Walking Dead

Fargo (season 4 only, first 2 seasons are amazing, especially 1)"
Diary Of Tootsies,"Once Upon A Time. Gave up during Season 6, even though it jumped the shark way earlier. 

The Morning Show. Had one more episode left of S2 but couldn't continue because it felt so self-indulgent, like I was watching these celebs jerk off each other over their acting abilities. 

The Walking Dead, just really bad after Negan entered the scene. 

Russian Doll, watched a few episodes of S2 and the concept was interesting but not enough to justify watching over other shows. I may return to it at some point."
Diary Of Tootsies,"I give up on most shows because they go on too long, and become repetitive.

Even if they are actually good, like Shameless or The Americans."
Diary Of Tootsies,"House of cards.   I legit loved the first two seasons.  After that,  Meh turned into disgust"
Diary Of Tootsies,"- The Blacklist
- The Flash"
Diary Of Tootsies,"The Wire. I know, its one of the greatest ever. Ive watched Breaking Bad, Sopranos, Better Call Saul multiple times. I even loved the first season. But I simply cannot get through season 2. I think ive been stuck on the first few episodes for three years now.

The Walking Dead is of course an easy answer."
Diary Of Tootsies,If a show has 5+ seasons I'm just totally unable to finish it
Diary Of Tootsies,Deadwood greys shameless arrested development
Diary Of Tootsies,"Sherlock — If you know, you know (and if you don’t know, imagine writing a story and without any build up or foreshadowing, throw dozens of things in the middle with no prior setup, and stumble from there.)

The recent run of Doctor Who, the 13th Doctor, her stories fell flat for me (and the Jack thing.) 

Which is a damn shame because the actress was trying her best with the material she had.

I might return to Doctor Who when the 14th Doctor comes into the picture since RTD was the saving grace for Doctor Who before, however, so half-y on Doctor Who.

But definitely Sherlock."
Diary Of Tootsies,"I recently gave up on Kaleidoscope, I thought it would be a fun show but I found it too dull, I stopped watching after the fourth episode.

I’ve given up on too many shows but these are some of the recent ones I’ve given up on: The Sandman, Blockbuster, Wednesday, The Old Man."
Diary Of Tootsies,"Outlander, Billions, NCIS, Masterchef, Teen Wolf, Shameless, American Horror Story, A Million Little Things, Archer, Twin Peaks/The Return, Orphan Black, The Vampire Dairies/The Originals, House of Cards, Orange is the New Black, Hemlock Grove."
Diary Of Tootsies,"The Walking Dead: think I stopped watching around S7/8/9 or something in that region. Eventually dragged on too long, had too much filler, quality declined, things didn't feel as high stakes etc. to the point where I lost interest.

Westworld: Watched S1 and liked it a lot, watched S2 and liked it somewhat, watched the S3 trailer and felt like it was gonna decline (or at least my level of enjoyment would) and thought ""yeah imma wrap up here"".

Game of Thrones: wasn't for me

House of Cards: wasn't for me."
Diary Of Tootsies,"Most recent is Night Court. I gave it a try because the original is so good but needs a reboot because of how poorly it aged. It's such a great concept for a show, but the new one is just awful. The show works if people are reacting to the ridiculous situations that occur, but the new show is just ridiculous people acting ridiculous. 



Other shows I didn't finish:

Breaking Bad everyone is unlikable and I couldn't get invested in the story. 

Cobra Kai started great when it was mostly focused on Johnny, but when it became a teen melodrama I left. 

The Office is just to cringe inducing."
Diary Of Tootsies,Succession.  Everybody's an asshole.
Diary Of Tootsies,I gave up on Falling Skies and Lost after about 3 seasons each. I just stopped caring.
Diary Of Tootsies,"Raised by Wolves

I love weird shows, but this one lost me somewhere. Either I didn’t get it or it was deliberately obtuse."
Diary Of Tootsies,"Cobra Kai. It started off as an homage to the movies and the 80s, but lately it's just a bad telenovela."
Diary Of Tootsies,I gave up on GoT after a couple seasons.
Diary Of Tootsies,"The Blacklist, Grimm, Fear The Walking Dead,  Falling skies, Riverdale and more..."
Diary Of Tootsies,The Last of Us
Diary Of Tootsies,Breaking bad. I got to that fly episode and I just couldn’t do it anymore
Diary Of Tootsies,"About to give up on Last of Us.  Episode 2 (outside of the Indonesia part at the beginning) can be summarized as:

*walk...walk...walk some more...walk...walk...walk...again we're walking....*

*hid, fight - BOOM.*

I will watch what I'm told is the greatest piece of television every created - episode 3 before making my final decision."
Diary Of Tootsies,"""The Arc"". At first I was excited because they said it was made by the same people that made Stargate. Then I realized these must be the people that made the horrible Stargate Universe spinoff. Just like Stargate Universe, ""The Ark"" is just a way-over-the-top teenage drama. They just use the SciFi concept as a device to create nonsense drama. They dont obey any of the laws of physics - it's insulting and infuriating."
Diary Of Tootsies,Sense8. Tried but got too weird too early.
Diary Of Tootsies,"Mayor of Kingstown, Fringe, King of the Hill is the most recent I couldn't finish"
Diary Of Tootsies,"If they had actual finales, go back and finish them unless they actually weren’t liked."
Diary Of Tootsies,"Star Trek, as a franchise"
Diary Of Tootsies,Dexter after the first season
Diary Of Tootsies,"The Flash. I always thought somehow I would make it, because I liked it longer than most, at least in spurts. But when he became father to the elemental forces of the universe, I just couldn't deal with the stupid anymore."
Diary Of Tootsies,"Every show the past 20 years, except Breaking Bad and a few sitcoms. Gonna get back to Better Call Saul sometime."
Diary Of Tootsies,Man I enjoyed Vikings soo much then each later season that enjoyment dwindled away. Even after Ragnar died there was some cool stuff (He was the heart of the show tho) but damn I had only final season left and just mentally tuned out. Couldn’t focus watching it at all.
Diary Of Tootsies,Walking dead goes through cycles of me giving up then getting back into it
Diary Of Tootsies,"Fear the Walking Dead got much better when they scrapped most of the original crew and brought Morgan into it…but then started going off the rails again. TWD itself was always watchable, but really lost its focus when Carl and Rick both left…it started becoming so repetitive that there were times when I wouldn’t bother to watch unless nothing else was on."
Diary Of Tootsies,"Fear 100000% I sat thru the awful season 4/5…. Seriously go watch it if you want to see the worst writing from tv I swear. So many things are poorly written… and then season 6 was okay, then they killed a main character midway and I gave up, and from the looks of it, killed off another main character…. THEN BROUGHT MADISON BACK AFTER THEY SENT THE OTHER AWAY…. Worst writing. And Vikings seasons 5/6 was a slog. It just turned into brother v brother"
Diary Of Tootsies,"Archer lost me around that time, but I kept watching. The latest season seemed to be a return to something resembling what it used to be. But it feels off, like the show is referring to the earlier Archer without really capturing the same tone and rhythm.

It doesn’t ask much out of me, so I keep watching. But I haven’t really enjoyed much of it since the coma season."
Diary Of Tootsies,"Yes, I watched the first episode of the newer one and it was so strange because they acted like no time passed at all. Kinda wish they left it alone."
Diary Of Tootsies,"Each episode is way too samey, even for a procedural."
Als de dijken breken,"I'm just here to say Thank you for Misbehavin' and Sassy on Sunday. Not religious in the slightest, and they are bangin' in my car every day. Even just got a shirt that says, ""I wash my hands to keep away from Satan""."
Als de dijken breken,"Thank you for taking the time out of your schedules to take part in this wonderfully informative AMA session. I am a big fan and a close follower of both of your careers (DeVoe's post-production supervising work on ""The Nanny Reunion: A Nosh to Remember"", Joseph's work with North Carolina screamo folk-pop band Pyramid) and I anxiously await to see what's next, or in this case - HEAR what's next.  


Here is my question for the both of you. Please forgive me if this has been asked before, but what kind of chair do you sit in/on when doing your music work for this show? Color, make, and model of chair would be greatly appreciated. If you work at a standing desk, why?   


Thank you."
Als de dijken breken,"Besides your own, are there any scenes in other TV/Movies where you give the musical selection a *Chefs Kiss* 

Also what’s your thoughts on the Guardians of the Galaxy music selection that has now made it’s way into every MCU and Comic book movie it seems."
Als de dijken breken,"I just finished the last episode and absolutely loved it. The music trailing off like an unwound music box until all that's left is the wolves, absolutely fantastic!

Could you give an example of the kind of notes you'd get for the music as it takes the shape we hear on the show?"
Als de dijken breken,We love the songs that play during credit roll. Where do you go to find new music and inspiration?
Als de dijken breken,"Are any of the church songs in the show, ACTUAL church songs you found? Or are they all originals for the show?"
Als de dijken breken,"Y’all do an incredible job with the music on the show! Do you already have songs in your mind that you want to incorporate into segments or do you have any synch catalogues that you scroll through to find suitable tracks?

Also sorry to shamelessly self-promote, but I’ve been trying to pitch our song, “[The Most Spiritual](https://youtu.be/uesWhseH0_s)” to the show since before season 1 even aired! Gotta shoot my shot!"
Als de dijken breken,How much of the Music Supervisor's job is searching for cool tracks/developing playlists (fun stuff) vs. dealing with the legal side of licensing (boring stuff)?  What's the ratio of rule to suck?
Als de dijken breken,"What's the process of creating music that needs to walk the line of fitting drama as well as comedy? And how do you select licensed music?

You've been nailing it btw!"
Als de dijken breken,What scene(s) are you most proud of?
Als de dijken breken,Hey I’m a aspiring supervisor and was wondering what the hardest thing is there to learn about being a MS?
Als de dijken breken,Tell me about this hot sauce!
Als de dijken breken,Will there ever be vinyl releases to any of the seasons of Eastbound?
Als de dijken breken,[deleted]
Als de dijken breken,"Your music choices are phenomenal, going back to the black keys Kenny powers dancing through the halls. Vice principals and righteous gemstones are full of bangers too. Some of the music is very obscure, how do you even find some of this stuff? And I’m what’s your Spotify name so I can follow you and steal your playlists?"
Als de dijken breken,Will there be an OST release? And the choir swelling to their satanic chanting after the biker gang escapes is amazing. Anywhere to listen to the full track?
Als de dijken breken,Are you by chance looking for an assistant that can help you with MS duties?
Als de dijken breken,"One of my favourite things about these shows is the music. I have found so many new favourites thanks to you guys. Thank you so much for what you do. My question is do you have a list of songs you would have preferred to use over certain key scenes, but couldn't get the licensing for so had to choose an alternative?"
Als de dijken breken,"Thank you for putting me on “Last night the devil learned my name” by Moondog Matinee. They are a really good band and that song is emotionally amazing. 
Do you guys have any advise for artist to get their music in front of music licensing supervisors? I know someone that makes custom music and has had some success making IG ads for big companies but needs to grow their network a bit."
Als de dijken breken,The arrangement of “Some broken hearts never Mend” was an amazing way to conclude the season. How did that sequence come about and what led you to choose the song? Don Williams totally fits the tone of the show and you guys took it to a whole new level. Would love to hear more about this process.
Als de dijken breken,"For MossManEsq - do you feel optimistic with all of the recent acquisitions of catalogs and publishing, that you might be able to access previously “hard no” material?"
Als de dijken breken,Why is sassy on Sunday such a bop 😩 what was the inspiration?
Als de dijken breken,"Are you guys essentially mainlining old gospel albums in your off time for inspiration to develop each character's singing voice, lyric writing style, etc?"
Als de dijken breken,"I purchased the OST on vinyl from Waxwork records and all I have to say is, praise be to he!"
Als de dijken breken,"Hello! I am a huge fan of both y'alls work, I loved the music in Vice Principals and now in Righteous Gemstones. Those end tracks in particular are always really powerful... And deep cuts I've literally never heard before! Also, just want to say I love Manglehorn, too. My question is about how y'all ended up meeting and forming your relationships the Rough House crew? 

I gotta shoot my shot, too! I've got a song called [Oh My God](https://open.spotify.com/track/07qB1V8ftxSImbhbrA9wPa?si=dc1a20232bc14f25) that I think would play soooo well on TRG. Also, here's a Christian track I'm obsessed with that may be of interest, [The Hem of His Garment](https://youtu.be/3oGV1k2Z7j0) by The Spencers. 

PS I love hot sauce and am always looking for a new one 2 try!! There's this amazing hot sauce that I get from the farmer's market that made with Rocoto peppers -- would recommend! 

Hope y'all are well!"
Als de dijken breken,"I don't have any questions, but hot damn do I love the music selections so far! Gideon's ride to So Tell The Girls I'm Back in Town gave me chills."
Als de dijken breken,"Thank you for introducing me to ""Memphis Soul Stew"". Such an amazing track that set the scene so well!"
Als de dijken breken,Sassy on Sunday is a hit in my house!!
Als de dijken breken,"@u/CycleNinjas @ mentioning just in case you see this and can answer another question: I burst out laughing when hearing the lyric from The Drop ""Jesus was a Gemstone"" during the scene outside the hospital. Just curious if there's a story behind this."
Als de dijken breken,"Hi guys, I've been watching Righteous Gemstones and Vice Principals, and I've heard way too many obscure songs used in Avalanches mixes that are also on these shows, to be a coincidence.

I think I heard ""I Believe in Miracles"" by the Jackson Sisters, and ""Stand on the World"" by the Joubert Singers on Righteous Gemstones episodes, heard ""Kites are Fun"" by The Free Design on one of the last episodes of Vice Principals, and probably a few others that I can't recall at the moment. Are these songs a product of being fans of The Avalanches and their mixes?"
Als de dijken breken,"JS: Ha! Thanks! Yes, one of the greatest joys of this job is the opportunity to write these song oddities. Misbehavin' is very dear to my heart"
Als de dijken breken,"JS: when not working from bed, I use this....

https://michaelputland.com/nesmith-michael-monkees-1970/"
Als de dijken breken,"DY: I honestly need to watch more of recent TV/Movies, so my pool of knowledge is not the best, but of the recent things I've seen, I really enjoyed the Music Selection for Watchmen and Russian Doll. I loved the music for Guardians of the Galaxy, and I think it's great that music selection has become an important part of the MCU movies. Music can really give TV/Movies character and added depth and layers."
Als de dijken breken,"JS: Thanks! Over the years we've developed a fairly short hand with Danny regarding musical choices....so many of the cues keep their basic shape from beginning to end. Often I'll pitch an idea to Danny before sending the audio...in case the idea to too far fetched....but more times than not, we get the green light to explore.

The notes are fairly minimal and mostly consist of ""let's get bigger here"" or ""darker here"" here. A few times I've had to redo thematic cues so Danny's happy with melodic elements"
Als de dijken breken,"DY: I'm just always listening to music, digging through Spotify or listening to NY Radio Shows, or checking out some weird old vinyl from Estate Sales. Friends will send me things to check out, and I'll also keep a running playlist of new releases to listen to. It's kind of like always being on a Safari Hunt wherever you go, trying to find interesting tracks and saving them for the right moment. I always used to love the End Credit songs for Sopranos, and was very excited when I got the chance to start placing End Credit tracks for Rough House shows. For me, that's usually the most fun song to place in an episode."
Als de dijken breken,"With the exception of 'Some Broken Hearts Never Mend' and Baby Billy's 'There is a Fountain', all of the Church Songs are original."
Als de dijken breken,"Thank you! I've been cataloguing music for the shows for about 12 years, and I have folders for just about any kind of thing or usage that comes up. When I read the scripts, I'll go through the folders and put together some options for each scene. I do remember that not long after I'd read the script for 201, I'd found Buck Owen's 'Tall Dark Stranger' album on vinyl and was listening to it, and played the title track a few times and thought it would be perfect for Eli's motorcycle ride. Same thing with the 'Fuck Yeah' track for the Muscle Men in 201, I heard that song and sent it to Danny as something that would be really cool for the Muscle Men at some point."
Als de dijken breken,That 'Most Spiritual' track is pretty hot!
Als de dijken breken,"Oh man, good question. It's about half and half. Obviously the music placement is more fun. Some of the Licensing Stuff can be fun in a detective sort of way, trying to track down the rights for some of the more obscure tracks, and you feel like Sherlock Holmes when you're able to make everything work out."
Als de dijken breken,Want to know too!!
Als de dijken breken,"Well, I think we always try and treat everything as drama, and serious. And the comedy comes from that music being used in ridiculous situations and moments."
Als de dijken breken,"DY: In regards to the Licensed Music, I'm always just collecting music that could work for the show and sorting it out by different moods and tones, and then based on that, I give the editors folders of tracks for each scene to try out. Sometimes, they'll send me a QT without music and I'll cut in some options myself to find out what really works best."
Als de dijken breken,"JS: Good question! I love the yodel cue that plays when Jesse and Amber barrel into the Lissons' ranch in Texas. Also, the last scene in S1 Ep 1 when the Gemstone sibs escape the parking lot showdown. The scene when Jesse uses the sling on Lissons is simple and good. I also like the Keefe themes and anytime the omnichord comes in for Judy/BJ"
Als de dijken breken,"JS: I forgot my absolute fav! After Harmon punches Baby Billy, he extends a hand to help BB up. The whistle cue that plays throughout the rest of the scene (and the following scene when Aimee-Leigh's ghost laughs at Baby Billy) is the best"
Als de dijken breken,"I'd say the hardest thing is probably mastering the Licensing and paperwork side. But I would also say that you always need to be on point with cataloguing all of the music that you go through, so that you can find it easily when the time comes."
Als de dijken breken,"JS: Ha. I usually keep a pepper garden every summer. Peppers like; 7 Pot Douglah, Fatalii, Viper, Scotch Bonnet, various habaneros and ghosts. Spicy fruity stuff. I mostly use oven roasted ingredients but I've also dabbled in long 12 mos. ferments, vinegars style, and jellies. Friends and family stay well supplied."
Als de dijken breken,"JS: While that would be awesome, the chances are probably fairly slim.....but who knows"
Als de dijken breken,"Check out all of Allen's stuff, it's great!"
Als de dijken breken,"DY: For the obscure tracks, I've always gravitated to songs that can kind of be owned by that moment in the show, and you haven't heard it anywhere else. Then from thereon when you hear that song, you think about that moment in the show. In terms of finding it, I'm just always digging in multiple places, listening to as much music as I can. I've always just loved listening to new music, whatever genre. I always feel like there's a good home for every song. Jimmytingles is my Spotify handle, there's a Playlist up there called Big Humphrey that has some fun stuff in it."
Als de dijken breken,"Yes indeed, the Soundtrack will be released this Friday. That track for the bike gang escape is a cover of Behemoth's 'O Father O Satan O Sun' by The Brides of Lucifer. Tis on Spotify."
Als de dijken breken,"Ah, not presently, but I'll let you know if the need arises! I tend to only do a project or two at a time so that I can really be deep hands on with all of the Music."
Als de dijken breken,"Glad you're digging the music! I think we've been very fortunate that pretty much everything we want to use, we're able to use. In the occasions when we were denied a usage, it actually pushed us to find a better song. So, I think everything that's in the shows is as it should be."
Als de dijken breken,"JS: Supervisors often look for untapped talent via sites like Bandcamp, Soundcloud, etc... There's also no shame in reaching out personally to industry professionals whose work you admire"
Als de dijken breken,"That sequence and the song were Danny's idea. He'd heard that song on a Sonos radio show while he was writing one day. He presented the song and we auditioned demos for a few other song options, but we stuck with 'Some Broken Hearts'. Then we worked out the structure of it, who would sing which part, and how it would time out with the Montage. I'll let Joey speak to the arrangement."
Als de dijken breken,"JS: I created a basic version of the song to use for the vocal recording; gave Danny, Edi, and Adam harmonies, brought everyone in the studio to create a first draft version of the song. This was also used for playback on the shoot day when the ""live performance"" was filmed. Instrumentation-wise, I took inspiration from Don Williams' version as well as the version by [Telly Savalas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hg0cpO-UYuQ). The song doesn't have many parts so I needed to extend certain areas to cover the length needed. Once I had an extended version, I hired a Nashville pedal steel ripper for the slide work then sent along to the editor, Justin Bourret. The final sequences have a lot of onscreen action so Justin needed to extend things even further from my first draft. Once the picture was locked, I went back and rearranged the song so it fit, musically, with the edit...then sent it out for approval. Once approved, I polished it off by adding a 20 piece string section and extra cinematic score tricks (timpani, sub tonal hits, synths) to such certain moments further."
Als de dijken breken,"Possibly, yes!"
Als de dijken breken,"JS: That tune is an homage to early Barbara Mandrell recordings from the late 70s/early 80s. Songs like ""Crackers"" ""Sleeping Single in a Doublebed"" and ""Pity Party"".  Danny liked the idea of the family sitting around listening to this upbeat country pop song while Eli is on life support from gunshot wounds. Jennifer Nettles came up with most of this song. She sent me a voice recording singing and playing the piano that I used to expand upon. We bounced ideas back and forth for a few weeks than went to a studio in Nashville to record the final music with her touring band."
Als de dijken breken,"JS: Great question! Actually those lyrics are ""Jesus loves a Gemstone"" but I was literally torn between using ""loves"" or ""was"".  The motif was first written for the scene in episode 1 when the Gems escape the parking lot meeting with the devil blackmailers. I went with ""Jesus loves"" because it created the sense that Jesus was watching over the Gemstones during that moment of danger....protecting them from harm. I thought it made them seem holy and righteous and chosen. Variations have been used throughout the series...mostly around Jesse heroics... a la the hospital attack"
Als de dijken breken,Do you think Dolly would do a version?
Als de dijken breken,Do you have any public playlists you can share? I love every song in all of the McBride shows. They have so much soul and are so perfect for each scene.
Als de dijken breken,Thank you! That’s so awesome that you’ve cultivated your own catalogue for so long and likely a big part of the reason that y’all are so good at what you do! I’m looking forward to rewatching the show and paying extra attention to the music placement!
Als de dijken breken,Thanks for the answer!
Als de dijken breken,"I thought it be something like that. 

Gotta say, ""Lay Down"" by Melanie Safka was probably THE most perfect credits song choice ever!"
Als de dijken breken,"The smash cut to Lyle covered in beach debris was one of the funniest moments in the season thanks to the accompanying sound effect, so thank you."
Als de dijken breken,"THIS! the whistle leitmotif with BB has always been my favorite, but when it changed up after the punch it brought tears to my eyes!"
Als de dijken breken,Oh yum. That all sounds really delicious!
Als de dijken breken,Thanks so much. Hopefully a vinyl release in the future too. Your work is amazing on the show. Thanks for making Sunday nights so much fun

Als de dijken breken,"Thanks, love it! When you have time I’d be curious to know more about the singers in the choral pieces like that (and in the intro sequence of the episodes). How many participants are there/is it a formal choir, any photos/clips of them in action? If any are actual church choir members and do they get a kick out of the premise of the show? I think it’s cool to see evangelicals who enjoy TRG and can appreciate elements of it."

When Justin (the Co-Producer and Lead Editor) was driving across country from LA to Charleston to work on Season 2, I'd made him a little playlist of possible tunes and that was on there, and he really wanted to use it, and found a good home for it."
Als de dijken breken,"Thank you! Vinyl Release coming soon from Waxwork Records, there will be some fun little treats in there."

I feel like (maybe for us older people) we usually remember (or rewatched in primetime compilation specials) Superbowl ads that relied on a clever concept, interesting visual, and/or big punchline. Now that they all want to go viral, it's a lot of Fallon/Corden-level 'jokes' of celebrities saying their catchphrase or lightly mocking their image (or worse, just... Being there) which may get a smirk in the moment but isn't memorable an hour later. Who's going to remember that Scorsese/Jonah Hill ad a month from now?"

The King in Love,Pretty sure it was all the illegal animal shit joe.
The King in Love,He’ll probably never financially recover from it
The King in Love,Seems appropriate to read this on the third anniversary of Covid since that show was what got people through the first few weeks lol
The King in Love,"The Netflix series aired in March 2020.  He was found guilty of conspiracy and animal abuse in April 2019.   He was sentenced to prison in January 2020.  Once again, Joe Exotic is bending facts to get some fame."
The King in Love,"I suspect it was his actions and choices, not the TV show that documented them."
The King in Love,Maybe don't hurt animals for profit you hillbilly numbnuts
The King in Love,"It didn't ruin his life, he's just angry and jealous.

Dude finally got everything he always wanted.  He's world famous, basically a household name, but he can't enjoy any of it, because he's in prison."
The King in Love,This dude’s life was a shit show long before Tiger King. I mean that’s the whole reason Tiger King was made.
The King in Love,You sure it wasn’t your giant fucking ego?
The King in Love,"Really? The criminal who recorded his crimes and put them on TV for millions of people to watch isn't doing great after he went to prison? 

For crimes? 

Shocking."
The King in Love,"“Anything but my actions responsible for my fall from grace,” says man whose actions were responsible for his fall from grace."
The King in Love,Don't go airing your dirty laundry in broad daylight.
The King in Love,Good. He ruined a lot of tigers’ lives.
The King in Love,"Netflix documentaries tend to always be edited in heavily manipulated way, but in this case seems like he ruined his own life for other reasons."
The King in Love,Not being smart enough to realize that willingly highlighting his crimes on a Netflix documentary ruined his life.
The King in Love,Joe Exotic is pretty shitty but that other cult leader guy in one of the Carolinas actually seems a lot worse.
The King in Love,I dare say that he is never going to financially recover from this
The King in Love,"One day you are living the dream. Drugging young straight men and having gay sex with them, killing tigers whenever. Then it all gets messy."
The King in Love,Is he saying he wouldn’t have got caught without the show?
The King in Love,that kid that shot himself had his life ruined you cunt
The King in Love,"Any business that relies on petting tiger cubs is going to result in abuse. It takes a lot of cubs per year to maintain that business, and they live for 20 years in captivity. 

Think about that, you probably get just a 8-10 weeks out of each Cub for people to pet them, but they live for 20 years. Having 10-15 adult tigers are needed in the zoo, but what happens to all of the other tigers? They would either need to all be sold off, but if that doesn’t happen you end up killing them or having so many they can’t be properly cared for.

That’s why any business that is about petting Tiger cubs is going to end up abusing the tigers in the end."
The King in Love,"Fucking good, he's a piece of shit who murdered tigers and put others through insanely bad conditions. 

The amount of outright misogyny that came out of that show and people for some reason harping on Carol when she literally was just trying to help the tigers and thinking the Joe was cool even though he was literally shooting tigers... I can't."
The King in Love,"This is the clown-brained fuck that rented a limo to pick him up from prison because he was 1000000% sure mango fuckstick was going to pardon him.

https://www.cbsnews.com/news/joe-exotic-no-trump-pardon-tiger-king-zoo/"
The King in Love,He is never gonna financially recover from this
The King in Love,Good
The King in Love,I am starting to feel like this guy blames anything for his problems.
The King in Love,"""I invited these people onto my property to film all the illegal shit I do to my animals and employees - and THIS is the thanks I get?""

Lol"
The King in Love,Pretty sure being a giant piece of shit ruined your life bud.
The King in Love,Nah I think being a general piece of shit ruined your life dude…
The King in Love,I would argue that it was he who ruined his life
The King in Love,He ruined his life. Don’t hire someone to kill someone else. That’s pretty easy not to do.
The King in Love,Pretty sure running what was essentially a tiger mill and planning an actual murder is what ruined his life.
The King in Love,Anyone who sells pizza with dumpster meat on it deserves to have their life ruined. Let alone all the other stuff he did.
The King in Love,"#Say the line! Say the line!

*Joe sighs*

I’m never gonna financially recover from this."
The King in Love,You reap what you sow
The King in Love,You sure it wasn’t that hairdo?
The King in Love,"Dude is delusional, so much brain damage. I mean, he thinks he is officially running for President in 2024. He thinks he may get out. Nut case."
The King in Love,It wasn't the documentary. He did it to himself.
The King in Love,Man tries to become famous.  Finds out being famous is not all its cracked up to be.  Whines about it.
The King in Love,Because his life was peachy prior to the show?
The King in Love,I'm shocked ..... SHOCKED ..... to learn that Joe Exotic does not take personal responsibility for his failings.
The King in Love,"He ruined his life before, during and after filming Tiger King.

He chose to put his shit out there now he’s famous like he’s always wanted along with those other hot mess of a cast."
The King in Love,No I think it was all the fuckin terrible shit you did Joe.
The King in Love,"Pretty sure that being an enormous shitbird ruined his life, but sure, blame the internet."
The King in Love,"The guy fucked over everyone to try and get famous for thirty years, and the dog finally caught the car."
The King in Love,"So he is pretending that *Tiger King* came out before his conviction?  Well, it's easy to lose track of time."
The King in Love,Joe ruined joes life.
The King in Love,Last Podcast on the Left talked about his crimes well before Tiger King was probably even pitched to Netflix
The King in Love,"I've watched that damn documentary about 10 times now, and it's just as entertaining as the first. Joe, you may hate it, but I fucking love it, you ole' gay ass cowboy."
The King in Love,"Animal abuse, illegal activities, meth, murder plot for hire, employee/lover accidently shoots himself in the head, employee's arm ripped off etc etc etc."
The King in Love,Says the guy who was in jail since before the show… but go off sis
The King in Love,I mean if you didn’t want a documentary made about all the crazy shit you did maybe don’t do all that crazy shit in the first place
The King in Love,"Dude doesn’t realize without the very thing he’s being interviewed for, he’s just be a nameless gay man dying of cancer sitting in prison. He ruined his own life, Netflix made a documentary about it."
The King in Love,"That kid accidentally shooting himself and the face and the reaction of that intern (or whatever his role was) who was in the room was one of the craziest things I've seen in media, and that's saying something seeing as how I watched all of Tiger King."
The King in Love,"If you ever feel low in life, just watch an episode of Tiger King. You'll feel better about your situation in about 30 seconds lmao"
The King in Love,Almost like youre a criminal that brought too much attention to yourself. Go to Hell groomer
The King in Love,"his “music career” was the most preposterous shit of all time lmao

that’s what I think about most from that show for whatever reason"
The King in Love,"Similar to that Chrisly knows best guy. 

If you’re doing illegal shit, don’t agree to publicly air everything while recording. Duh."
The King in Love,Gosh that doc was a masterpiece. Came out at the perfect time for it. During a time when everyone was in lockdown and no one knew what the fuck was gonna happen in the world and this came out and gave everyone a laugh.
The King in Love,Really? It’s the show that ruined his life?
The King in Love,It was going REALLY well before that ...
The King in Love,He ruined his own life
The King in Love,Lol he fucked around and found out
The King in Love,"Oh no...

Anyway.

🙄🎻"
The King in Love,"I watched the series and I still don’t get why the internet was so gaga for Tiger King. What I saw was a bunch of animal abusers just abusing animals. Shocking, interesting in a way, but it got old pretty quick."
The King in Love,Maybe the meth and planning a murder had a bigger role to play.
The King in Love,Blames the documentary (about everything he did to himself) for ruining his life lol. This is literally the most Joe Exotic thing ever lol.
The King in Love,Seems like he did it all by himself
The King in Love,"Bruh, you been high af on God knows what and rockin that r/justfuckmyshitup look for *how* long?? You’re right though, I’m sure it was the Netflix thing that ruined it all"
The King in Love,"Abuse animals? Jail. 

Use meth? Jail. 

Hire a hit man to kill your competitor? Believe it or not… straight to jail."
The King in Love,"He ruined his life, they just filmed it"
The King in Love,"The show didn’t cause your problems Joe, it exposed them."
The King in Love,You mean it exposed all the illegal shit you were doing?
The King in Love,Hiring an assassin might have that result
The King in Love,Maybe don’t court attention when you are involved in illegal and disreputable activities
The King in Love,That and all the crimes.
The King in Love,Tiger king filmed him ruining his life.
The King in Love,I mean wasn't that the purpose? To expose this whole debacle?
The King in Love,Joe Exotic taking responsibility for his actions challenge (Impossible)
The King in Love,"His life was ruined already, Tiger king exposed it"
The King in Love,"Ladies and gentleman, if you like pizza, pasta, or chicken Alfredo, I can promise you - Zooters is the place you want to stop."
The King in Love,It's like that meme of the guy on the bike putting the stick in his own spokes and then blaming a TV Show but he's in jail because he's a giant piece of shit.
The King in Love,Now that people know all the things I've done my life is ruined.
The King in Love,"What is, “things I do not care about?” Alex"
The King in Love,But not the attempted murder.
The King in Love,Idiot. Obviously
The King in Love,He'll never financially recover.
The King in Love,Pretty sure being a piece of shit ruined his life long before Tiger King premiered
The King in Love,Michael Keaton should 100% play him  in a biopic.
The King in Love,R/tigersatemyface?
The King in Love,His actions ruined his life.
The King in Love,False: he ruined his own life; Tiger King just showed the rest of us how much he fucked it up
The King in Love,Joe ruined his own life but refuses to face reality.
The King in Love,"If someone wants to make a documentary about you, you're either doing great or terrible things. The good thing is most doc subjects are narcissistic enough to believe they're always the former and let the cameras in."
The King in Love,Joe ruined his own life long before the show came out
The King in Love,I think Joe Exotic ruined Joe Exotic's life.
The King in Love,"Who cares, the public was entertained for a few weeks."
The King in Love,I’m other breaking news water is wet.
The King in Love,"Narcissists, always blaming external factors when the shit hits the fan."
The King in Love,"Out of all the things I would have thought ruined that turd’s life, documentaries would not be very high up the list. Being the embodiment of all things trashy and exploitative would have probably been my #1"
Im not a robot,"Rumors are that Rami and Portia's relationship hitting the rocks had something to do with the whole Angela story line but I've never seen anyone close to the situation actually comment concretely on it.


If you haven't yet, check out Hannibal. I'm still amazed something so bizarre aired on network television and wasn't canceled right out the gate."
Im not a robot,"The last 2 episodes are amazing. What amazes me is how risky it was to wind up the hack early and focus the ending episodes solely on Elliott's mental situation. They managed to pull it off fantastically.

Darlene's 'Hello Elliot' hits deep"
Im not a robot,The pilot is probably my favorite first episode of any television series EVER.
Im not a robot,S4E7 is the singular best episode of television ever imo.  The tension that episode creates with almost entirely just talking and in just two rooms is amazing.  Then you add on flawless performances and you have magic.
Im not a robot,"I love Mr Robot! It wasn’t too under-appreciated while it was airing (in fact I remember it being the Reddit Flavor Of The Week early on), but I feel like time hasn’t been kind to it in terms of staying relevant.

It starts as a show that feels so grounded but quickly and seamlessly transitions into a show that feels almost magical by the end. With such big things to say, and such outlandish concepts to present, it had to!

Watching it week to week turned characters like Whiterose and Wellick into these larger than life, almost mythical kind of people who loomed over the entire thing.

You literally could not predict it (aside from the time that /r/MrRobot called the Season 2 twist from the very first episode) and it was such a fun show for it.

None of that is to mention how great the cinematography, editing, and performances are.

All-time great that doesn’t get enough play these days! Maybe because it’s so tight that there’s very little left to discuss? Regardless, it feels more relevant every day and that alone makes it worth a watch."
Im not a robot,"It's not just my favourite show of all time, it's one of my favourite pieces of media period.

I totally get why a lot of people fell off during Season 2 though. Even as a massive fan of the show I can acknowledge that it drags a bit, although it was somewhat necessary to build up to Seasons 3 & 4 which were nothing short of incredible. Still, it's a shame that this show never got exposed to a wider audience because it's so fucking good."
Im not a robot,"One of the criticisms I’ve seen is “technically possible but highly improbable” 

That seems like a compliment to me than seeing a bunch of fake computer magic.

It’s a TV show I don’t wanna see any highly probable but mundane stuff. I wanna see a bunch of cool stuff and if it’s technically possible that’s enough for me."
Im not a robot,"I'm almost to the end of season 2 and I'm really enjoying it.  OP is right that is a very strange show.  Shots are framed off-centre to help produce an uneasy feeling, most of the characters are emotionally flat, which echoes Elliot's lack of emotions, and the soundtrack gives it a feeling of something out of time.  Modern tech with 80s synth music.  

It's all really strange, but everyone in it is great, with Christian Slater being the real standout, to me."
Im not a robot,"Season 2, the Alf episode, and the reasons for it were pretty much for me the best thing I’ve ever seen done in a TV series. Abuse the hell out of your audience, that’s a new one."
Im not a robot,"The most Intelligent show I've seen! The detailing In every scene Is top notch! 

As for my favourite, Darlene was the most fascinating character, thanks to Carly!"
Im not a robot,"You should check out Legion. It's similar in that certain parts of it feel like they were conceived while on an acid trip. Amazing acting, great music, random dance scene, lots of mind fuckery. It's an amazing show."
Im not a robot,[This does a great job of explaining the show.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v0WKrkay5Dk)
Im not a robot,"Yeah i think it was one of the top 10 best shows of the past decade, and people should keep preaching its praises. I personally use it as the recommendation when anyone I know complains “all shows are the same now.” (Maybe all shows YOU watch. Try these… heh)"
Im not a robot,"Could you imagine if that show had dropped during COVID instead of during such a crowded period (""Golden Era"") of prestige television? I mean, I know I could say the same about many shows of that time, but I often think that Mr. Robot (and Halt and Catch Fire) could and should have been bigger."
Im not a robot,Just wanted to let you know you have a spoiler in your write up. You recommend the show to people who haven't see it so you probably did not intend to mention that >!Darlene is Elliot's sister.!<
Im not a robot,"It's in my top 5. A brutal show, in a good way."
Im not a robot,"it's a great ride

it's too bad a decent chunk of audience gave up on it during Season 2"
Im not a robot,RELEASE THE LAST SEASON LAST HALF SOUNDTRACK RIGHT NOW!
Im not a robot,It truly is a hidden gem of television. It should be held up as one of the greatest TV series of all time and yet not that many people have watched it.
Im not a robot,I'd rank it in my top three with The Wire and the Breaking Bad/Better Call Saul wombo combo. Which one is first depends on my mood and the time of day. Very few shows in television history have shown such consistent excellence and adherence to showrunner vision.
Im not a robot,This is one of the most underrated shows probably ever. Such an intense and emotional ending that will bring you to tears.
Im not a robot,"I love bizarre, unique, risk-taking shows and mysteries. Mr. Robot was a match made in heaven for me. My wife and I discussed theories endlessly about what the fuck was going on.

I really don't think I'll ever see something like it again"
Im not a robot,Great revenge series.
Im not a robot,It's one of the most unique shows I've ever seen
Im not a robot,Give Twin peaks a go
Im not a robot,"Season 2 was, honestly, a bit of a brutal drag. Beyond that I agree with Angela, and I really feel like the whole Dark Army plot and Whiterose was a little out there / didn't pay off in the end."
Im not a robot,I could see this as being a progression of Christian Slater's character from Pump Up the Volume. Maybe he went from pirate radio to computer science in college and decided to stay on a rogue path.
Im not a robot,"A lot of the fun was having to wait a week for the next episode, and all the fan theories got really deep. The show played with the fans too creating fake websites and social media accounts. Better late than never for one of the most entertaining shows ever! Very dark and violent, usually not my type of show, but done in a unique way that was brilliant."
Im not a robot,Now watch Legion
Im not a robot,This show should have been embedded into the culture zeitgeist - it’s underrated in that regard
Im not a robot,Probably my favourite show of all time. But its not without its flaws. My main gripe is also how they handled Angelas storyline. They cut it abruptly due to Portia’s drama with Rami Malek and pay disputes. Id love to know what Esmail originally planned for her before he rewrote the final season.
Im not a robot,"Weak S2 nonwithstanding, one of the best televisoin shows ever made. 

I don't think Rami Malek will ever equal it. He's made his fortune on the whites of his eyes shining brightly.  His Pacific role was well done, but I didn't find him a very good Freddie unfortunately and didn't care for his Bond villain role."
Im not a robot,"My biggest critique (nay, disappointment...) is we never got a conclusion to the Darlene/Dom relationship"
Im not a robot,"I loved it, but IMO as popular as it was, two seasons was enough.The show was taken down to such mediocrity by the last season that it lost all it's originality."
Im not a robot,It wasn't actually one take tho. But yeah that episode was awesome.
Im not a robot,"MAJOR MR ROBOT SPOILERS HERE >!One strength of how they ended Angela’s story is that it is easily the most shocking TV death ever. The season starts with the scene from the S3 finale, making you think its a recap. Then it continues. Pyrce gets up, walks away, we see people walk over to Angela and then BAM. A character we’ve known for 3 seasons just died in a second.!<"
Im not a robot,"Yeah Hannibal is truly unbelievable because it aired on NBC. It's surprising that it aired anywhere outside of streaming or HBO, and absolutely insane that it aired on the Network that gave us Law & Order, Law & Order SVU, Law and Order Criminal Intent,  Law and Order Organized Crime, Law and Order Trial by Jury, Chicago Fire, Chicago PD, Chicago Med, etc."
Im not a robot,+1 for the Hannibal recommendation.
Im not a robot,"I have a hard time believing that Angela's death wasn't planned, it's hugely important for the final season and the final episode(s). 

Unless someone says something about it, I think it's most likely just a rumour."
Im not a robot,Also I wonder if Frances Shaw getting cancelled impacted any sort of twists. There were so many weird things in the episode of that Angela died that I refuse to believe that it wasn't their intention to reveal she was alive later on in the show.
Im not a robot,I just got goosebumps reading that last sentence!
Im not a robot,"I've rewatched the show at least 4 times, ""Hello Elliot"" still me makes me bawl"
Im not a robot,"not to mention what happens has been built up and telegraphed FOR YEARS. when you find out what's going on, it almost demands you rewatch the show to catch everything you missed leading up to that moment"
Im not a robot,"I've seen over 5k episodes of tv, spanning everything you can think of, and S04E07 is by far the best episode of television I've ever seen.

The first time you watch it, it's an indescribable experience. And it still hits hard on each rewatch."
Im not a robot,"I expected it to be lame when reading the synopsis. I mean, c'mon, Bringing back a side-antagonist who disappeared in the middle of season 1?

""Sam Esmail is trying too hard to tie up every lose ends!"", said my innocent self.

How little did I know... Just when I thought the show ran out of plot twists by season 2, this one hit me like a truck.

The way that it's so obvious in hindsight with little hints scattered throughout previous seasons, yet the reveal itself still being able to completely blindside you.

God, what an episode."
Im not a robot,"If it was on HBO or Netflix (Prime now-a-days) it would be appreciated more. Kind of like Breaking Bad on AMC. It took the Netflix bingers to make that show a powerhouse because nobody was checking out AMC network for prestige, prime time drama."
Im not a robot,I’ve heard the opposite from computer scientist friends saying it’s the only thing they’ve seen in shows or movies that was at least in the ballpark for accurate representation of hacking. (Especially how so much of the time it comes down to confidence games with people or physical access to a place rather than just speed typing on a PC.)
Im not a robot,"Most shows just show an interface with a status bar reading ""hacking 96% complete"" or something like that or, at worst, two people frantically typing on the same keyboard at once while the hacker keeps ""breaching their botnet"" or whatever gibberish the writer thinks sounds high-tech and hacky.

Kor Adana worked hard to make sure that every hack shown in the show was at least feasible.  And, yeah, it's a TV show.  We don't really want to see things that are ""probable"" because that would be pretty boring."
Im not a robot,"Hacking in movies and TV you just need to accept as like magic in fantasy, it's works because they say it works, now just enjoy how it effects the story around it."
Im not a robot,"Mr Robot is on my top 3 best shows of all time and I love surrealist and psychological stuff.

But somehow I did not like Legion, I watched four episodes and I didn't enjoyed it. Does it get better?"
Im not a robot,Legion jumped the shark in season 2 for me. Then it just got too far out there.
Im not a robot,"There was a stretch of time from like late 2016 - early 2017 when I was going through Mr. Robot S2, Legion S1, Westworld S1, and Black Mirror S3. Talk about a mindfuck..."
Im not a robot,Legion is Mr robot if Elliot also happened to be the most powerful super hero in the universe
Im not a robot,If you google the show it spoils it as well in the cast and character description.
Im not a robot,"While I enjoyed quite a lot of it, this show felt like a one - maybe two - season show. The Whiterose story was just a big filler arc. A lot of very unsatisfying ends to different character arcs as well."
Im not a robot,I remember before that episode aired the showrunner was telling people not to miss the opening minutes
Im not a robot,"> >!easily the most shocking TV death ever!<

>!Great scene, and very shocking!< , but this is a little hyperbolic. Even if it's personal opinion, the ""easily"" is a little too much. Game Of Thrones >!had a couple deaths that were more shocking imo, even if the book readers already knew about them!<"
Im not a robot,"I still don’t know how it was possible to be on basic cable. This and Mr Robot just didn’t make sense to be on cable but somehow survived. Well, Hannibal didn’t totally survive as it wasn’t really finished. Hoping it comes back."
Im not a robot,"I sorta feel like there's a holy trilogy of ""how did this happen the way it happened"" television shows that are also, not coincidentally, some of the best television that's aired in the past 30 years.

Mr. Robot, Hannibal, and Halt and Catch Fire."
Im not a robot,Exactly. It explained so much how Elliot behaves.
Im not a robot,That's the stage play one right?
Im not a robot,"Not even just the hacking part, but the terminology and theory and minutia behind IT infrastructure. I'm a sysadmin by trade and no show has ever nailed our profession as accurately as Mr Robot.

I actually squealed with joy when Elliott was trying to socially engineer a low level secretary in one episode and he freaked out when he realized she had an RSA token for authentication and he'd have to steal it."
Im not a robot,"The terminology, syntax etc are correct. Anyone familiar with Unix or the programming languages used (Python was used fairly often IIRC) can vouch for that. The knock on the realism really comes down to the speed at which things are accomplished. The best programmers in the world couldn’t come up with the stuff Elliot does in the time he does. But that’s totally fine. No one wants to watch a show that depicts actual day-to-day programming. The narrative expedience is welcome, and it was ultimately nice to have a show that doesn’t treat hacking like typing really fast resulting in a Matrix-style pop-up saying “HACK COMPLETE”"
Im not a robot,"I remember there was one episode where he was trying to find info on a guy for whatever reason, and he just walked up to him in the street and asked to use his phone to call a cab, called his own number and then got the guy's phone number from his own call history and just looked him up from there."
Im not a robot,So can hackers just speed-read all those lines of code like Elliott was doing and figure out what to tinker with in seconds/minutes? That's what amazed me. But I'm an English major so I'm easily impressed.
Im not a robot,It is accurate hacking. But mostly towards the later seasons the criticism was that it as too unlikely. Like perfect storm type of stuff. Which “took the viewer out of it”
Im not a robot,They hired a lot of actual infosec professionals as consultants.  Everything you saw on the show is technically possible.

Im not a robot,You should watch Severance if you haven't already.
Im not a robot,"You get things explained,  and it gets a lot better in terms of shifting perceptions and expectations"
Im not a robot,"It definitely gets better, but might just not be for you. I don’t really know how to describe the differences between the two. Mr robot is really dark and gritty and creative, legion is a lot brighter, has some classic super hero show tropes but totally breaks the mold with how totally abstract it is. A common criticism is that it’s a little too far out there, but I really loved it.

I think the coolest thing legion does is that it takes this super insightful deep dive into psychological and emotional trauma and how it forms who people become and what they struggle with, which I think is really hard to do without being super on the nose about it. Legion is a super hero show that doesn’t pander to anyone."
Im not a robot,Ya season 1 was amazing. Season 2 was far from that for me. Decided to not watch season 3.
Im not a robot,"Ned dying was more shocking to me, because he was the protagonist, and from that moment on I knew all bets were off and this wasn't a normal TV show were good guys would win without any death from their side."
Im not a robot,USA network were really supportive of Mr Robot. Other networks passed on it first. They allowed the show to continue even when the viewership got smaller each season.
Im not a robot,"NBC is broadcast TV, which is usually like 20 times more conservative* than basic cable.


*Conservative in the ""playing it safe"" definition of the word."

Im not a robot,"> The best programmers in the world couldn’t come up with the stuff Elliot does in the time he does.

I think it's worth noting that Elliot having almost supernatural hacking abilities is part of the show's premise, making it much easier to suspend your disbelief."
Im not a robot,"""I'm in"""
Im not a robot,"I think that’s legit. A lot of human expertise gets amazing to non experts. I’ve worked a decade in anatomic pathology and watched pathologists zoom around the microscope (pushing a slide with their fingers with like millimeter precision) to diagnose cancer and that’s absolutely incredible to watch too. (If that kind of thing interests you in particular, I’d recommend the book Blink by Malcolm Gladwell that talks a lot about the quick glances of experts and such.)"
Im not a robot,"> So can hackers just speed-read all those lines of code like Elliott was doing and figure out what to tinker with in seconds/minutes?

Sometimes yes sometimes no. No singular person would be as good as elliott in every single discipline and topic though.  Kim Peak could read the left and right page of a book at the same time and recall everything, so its technically possible for some people.."
Im not a robot,"> It is accurate hacking. But mostly towards the later seasons the criticism was that it as too unlikely. Like perfect storm type of stuff. Which “took the viewer out of it”

That's kind of stupid. You don't make a movie, tv show, or story based on mundane regular occurances. You tell stories based on the outlier, the once-off, the extreme. 

Like you make a story about a Hurricane, you don't make a story out of an afternoon sprinkle of rain."
Im not a robot,"It HAD to be that way, or every episode would have been days long."
Im not a robot,"Okay. Too bad for that person, I guess? I bet they don’t like fiction in general, as “being unlikely” is usually a central part of what makes fiction interesting."
Im not a robot,"I'd call it the original adult super hero show, it really doesn't pander to anyone and doesn't look to be merchandised which might be easier with the boys, and invincible"
Im not a robot,"I felt season 2 was kinda dull, the story was a bit random and all over the place, but season 3 was a massive return to form, visually stunning, much more coherent story (whilst still being legion) - there's one particular episode that kind of departs from the main story that is amazing"
Im not a robot,you were smart to do that
Im not a robot,3 was amazing though
Im not a robot,"I don't know if you've read the books, but it's even more crazy in the book because ned narrates like 70 percent of the first book."
Im not a robot,Glad they did let it finish. Would have been such a waste otherwise.
Im not a robot,I am currently reading it.
Im not a robot,"I do it as a basis of scheduling.

If I find out a show is cancelled without closure, I don’t bother watching."
Im not a robot,"What's difficult for me about this is that the show's that are in their first or second season who inevitably get cancelled, didn't have the viewership to begin with *because* people were waiting for like season 3 or 4 so they can binge it when they have the time and interest in a longer show to enjoy.  


It's a snake eating its own tail. The network/streamer cancels the show that doesn't get ratings vs viewers not watching it as it comes out because they've been burned before by cancelled shows they wait for more content to watch it lol"
Im not a robot,"The real abomination is cliffhanger endings. 

When I commit myself to a season of television, I want closure at the end. 

A contrived cliffhanger ending is a cheap and unnecessary trick."
Im not a robot,"Finally, some data to hear what I've heard anecdotally A LOT over the last couple of years."
Im not a robot,The Babysitters Club was cancelled?! Nooooo! That was such a cute shot of nostalgia
Im not a robot,"As someone in the UK, I hate when a show is cancelled with the excuse of poor viewing figures, but it's neither advertised or not available till 6 months after airing in the US if made available at all"
Im not a robot,"Well, yeah.

Paper Girls. Good show, didn't deserve to be cancelled. I think we were five episodes in when it was announced, and then just gave up because we just didn't see the point.

The kicker is that it, and hundreds of cancelled shows just like it, are littering streaming services. With every show we choose to watch we have to look up whether it's been cancelled, or if it's popular so we can gauge if it will be cancelled."
Pasta,The whole episode was great last night. Pedro was great. Best episode of the season. Eps like this are the reason I watch every week hoping to happen but only happen once or twice a season.
Pasta,The 10 to 1 skits are always either the best or worst skits of the night. There is no in-between.
Pasta,The Wing Pit commercial had my writhing in my chair I was laughing so hard.
Pasta,I’ve never seen Bowen break like that. He was done for by the midway point lol
Pasta,Poor Pedro didn't stand a chance did he?
Pasta,VIP goes to that pitcher of iced tea that didn't spill a drop.
Pasta,That extra almost did a spit take into his cup
Pasta,Do you think the table shaking wasn't quite this violent in the rehearsals? That's the only reason I can see for everyone losing it. I bet only Ego knew it was going to go that hard.
Pasta,"This, the Mario Kart skit, and the hot wings bit were hilarious. I didn’t expect to be laughing so much at SNL lol."
Pasta,"Last sketch in the show and Molly Kearney is the only one able to keep a straight face, Pascal and Yang struggle the most."
Pasta,"this whole sketch was hilarious and I hollered when she said ""oh cause we black"" and it looked like the guy behind her almost choked on that drink lol"
Pasta,This was a great episode of SNL. This was a high point but the whole thing was excellent.
Pasta,Does anyone know where to get mirrored versions of this? Why is the SNL channel blocked overseas? I don't get it.
Pasta,Mirror?
Pasta,I don't ever remember a time where they used the same set two sketches in a row like this.
Pasta,Ego is the greatest. Best young cast member on the show.
Pasta,"This is right up there with that one Debbie Downer skit with Lindsay Lohan, where pretty much everyone broke character throughout the skit.  I'm all for this kind of silliness on SNL."
Pasta,How about a piece of that ass?
Pasta,COOK MY MEAT
Pasta,Pedro breaking character is the best. Especially when they did the Community table read [on zoom (25:25)](https://youtu.be/V6Q_nlSULio)
Pasta,Cut out a little too late. Bowen was on point swinging his finger like “out on top out on top”
Pasta,That pitcher is amazing. It just refuses to fall over.
Pasta,This is Debbie Downer Disney sketch levels of funny!
Pasta,Cos we black?? 🤣🤣
Pasta, Bowen in all the skits tonight. So proud. Love him. He deserves it because he’s so talented
Pasta,"This was good, but now I keep thinking back in the movie quiz.


Cause as Bowen asked the 2020 questions I was exactly like the contestants, I know something relating to the question is going on but I just couldn’t name all the films, except for maybe women talking."
Pasta,"Molly at the jump thinking, “In 20 seconds nobody is gonna care that I don’t have a glass.”"
Pasta,If this comes back - hibachi
Pasta,"As a person living in Temecula, they missed the joke potential."
Pasta,“Waking up” was the best sketch of the night.
Pasta,"I don’t watch SNL anymore but I love Ego Nwodim because of her appearances on the Comedy Bang Bang podcast, so I’m glad to see that she’s at least getting some chances here to show off her talents. She’s so funny."
Pasta,Great physical comedy!! 😝
Pasta,"I’m so confused why did she have to be from Temecula and was the table always suppose to be the punch like or did it just go side ways lmfaooo

Either way I completely lost it"
Pasta,"If someone had no idea what sketch comedy is, this would be the perfect example to show them."
Pasta,these are some of my favorite moments on SNL
Pasta,This is hilarious
Pasta,I love it when ego always go for the racial bits.
Pasta,Every service worker knows a Lisa lol
Pasta,She’s a treasure. Easily one of the best black female cast members since Maya Rudolph. LOVE HER. 😂
Pasta,Funniest sketch this season
Pasta,It's funny but sad there's actually people like that.
Pasta,"I'm wondering if I missed something.  I actually live in Temecula, CA and I'm wondering why they made a skit about someone from Temecula.  Was there something that happened in the news recently about people in Temecula?  I would love to know if there is a particular reason they chose to make her from Temecula and to have that type of personality.  I enjoy poking fun at myself and others so I feel I would get a lot more out of this if there was some back story about it.  


Thanks, in advance."
Pasta,I thought this was awful
Pasta,This skit was so damn funny!!! 😂 😅 😂 😅 😂 😅 😂 😅 😂 😅 😂 😅 😂
Pasta,SO funny. When she dropped the tough as rocks steak 😂
Pasta,What's the essence of uploading in a public forum if you've region locked your videos?
Pasta,"This may be the least funny thing I’ve seen. Why is everyone breaking, there’s literally no jokes. The table shaking?"
Pasta,Can't remember the last time SNL was funny.
Pasta,Wonder why they don't allow me to watch this in canada
Pasta,they just stopped caring and laughed
Pasta,Boring and racist.
Pasta,My phone was shaking as much as that table from the laughter. Great skit
Pasta,"This sketch was hilarious, and very accurate to folks I’ve known. 😂"
Pasta,Hahaha it's like the Debbie Downer sketch. Loved it.
Pasta,How fun.
Pasta,The new snl logo looks like shit
Pasta,I just watched this episode. One of the funniest ones I've seen in a long time. This sketch made the episode! Perfect last sketch. At first I was like really another restaurant sketch bc they just did one but damn this was funny!!
Pasta,"I feel like that’s how SNL has always been, but as time passes we only remember the highlights so people always say it “used to be better.”"
Pasta,"They’ve had a string of good hosts lately, but Pedro won the writing lottery. Felt bad for Michael B. Jordan last week. He definitely put in the effort, but the writing was sub par."
Pasta,"Usually, it seems like the host is only in about half of the skits, but I think pedro might have been in every single one. I don't know the last time I've seen that, but it's pretty rare. Kudos to him for that"
Pasta,Always elevates a skit when the actors don’t look like their permanently staring at the script boards off screen
Pasta,"Oh I think Aubrey Plaza's ep was by far funnnier in every way. Pedro seems great but like, not really cut out for it. Aubrey like, started off doing improv and is funnier than many of the cast members."
Pasta,"That 10 to 1 spot is where they put the most far out, absurd, and experimental sketches. When it connects it's usually a home run."
Pasta,Best skit of the night? Let’s put a pin in that
Pasta,"""10 to 1""?"
Pasta,That’s Will Forte real estate
Pasta,It reminded me both of the Taco Town and Totino's ads of SNL past.
Pasta,I had tears. It was so good!
Pasta,Yesss I loved that skit!
Pasta,I was literally screaming with laughter at that one.
Pasta,Him throwing down his fork and just letting go made *me* lose it.
Pasta,Even the guy drinking in the background broke and laughed
Pasta,Respect for going for that last ass line. He went for it. 🫡
Pasta,[He couldn't get through the giving of sperm in the community table read](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5khGDthY7QQ)
Pasta,"The only thing that didn't break in this sketch, in fact"
Pasta,I think it was supposed to be sangria.
Pasta,You think they had a magnet under the table on that thing? I can't figure out how it lasted so long on the table.
Pasta,Did you maybe mean MVP?
Pasta,Yeah right I don’t see the skit that funny to lost it like that
Pasta,"What made the chicken wing sketch great is that you knew where it was going, and then it steered right into it with the chicken deity which was a hilarious surprise."
Pasta,The hot wings one was my favorite of the night
Pasta,I thought the hot wings one was the least good tbh! It was still funny but I thought everything else was better.
Pasta,To be fair most of the season has been full of stinkers.
Pasta,"> hot wings bit

The cement chute part is what got me."
Pasta,Pascal could not get thru his story and him breaking made me cackle. This is hilarious
Pasta,"Honestly can't tell how much of their thousand-yard stare after ""Oh, 'cause we're black?"" is in-character and how much is that being the only way they could avoid breaking. Hilarious contrast in between Bowen completely losing his shit and Pedro having to look away and cover his mouth."
Pasta,"She breaks too! It's pretty small, but it's there. The only person who didn't break was Longfellow at the start.

The spirit of Chris Farley was definitely moving that table."
Pasta,Bowen absolutely could not handle that line either.
Pasta,"I almost feel like that was an ad lib because even the waiter lost it, and Bowen has never broken so hard."
Pasta,This was hilarious but the Mario Kart HBO trailer was the highlight for me.
Pasta,"I was so worried because I love Pedro Pascal and it sucks when someone you like has an awful snl episode, but he was fantastic. I hope they'll have him back again."
Pasta,"Pedro’s Latina mother was a knockout for me. Having been raised by a Hispanic mother and grandmother, broken Spanglish and white girlfriends hit close to home."
Pasta,It’s blocked in Canada too

Warm and Cozy,"However different our tastes may be, I think it's great how you always seem to put such a lot of effort into your writings.

I've got a question, though.

>Shows categorized based on originality, creativity and innovation

It's not easy reconciling the above with some of your actual ratings: *Firefly Lane* (just as an example, I haven't seen it) you give a 6.8 - a rating you subsequently explain by calling the show ""forgettable"", and by saying it ""does nothing to stand out"".

So... How can a show seemingly so wholly lacking in originality, creativity, and innovation *measured by those very same categories* still get a 6.8? Shouldn't it be more like, I dunno, a 2? Or do you count up to 100? How exactly did you arrive at the (very precise!) number 6.8?"
Warm and Cozy,The best show this year was mare of east town
Warm and Cozy,"For all Mankind was epic, Invincible was great too"
Warm and Cozy,"Hacks is good, that's pretty much the only one I've been interested in."

Dom is a very hard series to label '*good*' or '*bad*'. It certainly holds your attention throughout, with it's emotional stories about addiction, exciting burglary scenes, intriguing drug busts operations and gorgeous locations, but it's all so disjointed and incoherently written.

&#x200B;

Porni doesn't do too bad at accomplishing what it sets out to accomplish. It's a very genuine and relatable series about motherhood, there just isn't anything here that makes it stick out. Not the plot, not the characters, not anything really.

Mare of Easttown is by all means a well put together series, my issue is there's not an ounce of originality to be found here. It's too typical a '*whodunnit*' detective mystery-drama, in the same style and execution we've seen a million times already. The performances and character work act as saving grace, but at the same time its not like we haven't seen character work or emotional weight of this magnitude before.

Genera+ion does have potential, but so far, besides it being more LGBTQ+ centric, hasn't branched out beyond being the average teen show. They do have opportunity to make some audacious and daring decisions here with a very strong group of characters, whether or not they will capitalize, we'll see, but Genera+ion definitely needs something to stand out. Crazy enough the best episode here so far is the one directed by Lena Dumhum. From her 'Girls' days she's always been a master of making great episodes that are literally about nothing.

This one falls into '*so bad it's good*' territories. A series that's bat shit crazy, overly dramatic and unpredictable in the sense that the writers don't give fuck all about consistency, cohesion... or logic. Mexican telenovela at its finest.

A psychological-thriller that's fascinating... baffling... and bat-shit crazy! I'm not sure what to even say the premise of this is. What starts out as a 'unconventional love-triangle', develops into something so... left-field. The writing is more in line with a soap-opera, but it's one of the most unpredictable stories I've ever seen if you ask me.

Following a group of friends from the year they met while *walking the camino*, to different period in their life throughout the years where they would walk it again and again, 3 Caminos is centered around the Camino de Santiago and feels very much like an advertisement for the ""spiritual"", ""life-changing"" walk. Apparently it's funded by the European Tourism Board, and that will put things into perspective when you watch it, but besides having to hear the word ""Camino"" over and over again the series does have its upsides. Its stunning visuals and scenery for one, also its very calm and tranquil atmosphere, plus the feeling you get at the end, like you've just finished watching something very profound, meaningful and life-changing... even though you haven't."
Warm and Cozy,">Inspired by the true life story of Christiane F., unlike the 1981 film Wir Kinder vom Bahnof Zoo takes a more stylistic approach, modernizing the 1970s with contemporary music, glossy visuals and unexpected surrealism as it tells the tragic story of kids on drugs.

Not with you on that. But, I read the book for at least 5 times, and maybe find it hard to separate. Still, I feel its a bit a case of many overwritten drama shows. In the book - which I found a much tougher read today as back then when parents and teachers used it as anti-drug-pamphlet - there is foucs on the social background, but still I got more the sense that a lot of this teenagers where hapless kids that were overwhelmed by what happened. Got shocked how easy it was in the 1970ies to go to the center of Berlin as a John and buy teenage junkies for sex.

With you on ""Yasuke"". Generally I am not fond of the trend started by Castlevania to make this super short anime series. I wished ""Yasuke"" had some filler episodes. Too crammed with everything they could pull out of their minds."
Warm and Cozy,"Following the list:

Invincible is absolutely a 8 from me too.

Warm and Cozy,Does anyone know any shows that is like Dark?
Warm and Cozy,I recommend Scenes from a Marriage on HBO. Its very well acted and well written.
Warm and Cozy,Of those i have seen probably invincible.
Warm and Cozy,"Oh that's because the 'rating' I give when I *review* a series, isn't just '*how I feel about the series from 1-10*'. Well... it is and it isn't. Originality, creativity and innovation are still the basis of my ratings and the determining factors as to whether or not I like something... but I still rate all the essential elements, then use the average as the final score.

Hopefully this makes more sense.

    > Firefly Lane:
    Originality/Creativity : 6 
    writing (plot & cha): 7 
    writing (dia): 6 
    acting: 8 
    visuals/cine: 7 
    prod.: 7 
    rating: 6.8

I don't post it like this because it makes more sense in my head then when shared lol. Rating the visuals, acting, writing etc. individually then using the average as the final score allows me to work out how good i thought something was overall without thinking about it directly you know.... I also remove 1.0 point whenever I don't finish something. It might sound weird... but Im just glad someone cared enough to ask. lol."
Warm and Cozy,That's because you haven't seen Wonder Egg Priority yet. 😉
Warm and Cozy,Kate Winslet was just phenomenal in that. Some of the finest acting that I have ever seen. The rest of the supporting cast were all really good also.
Warm and Cozy,Is it too America centric?
Warm and Cozy,"For all Mankind is a hidden gem, if it were on any other network it would be massively popular. Fantastic show."
Warm and Cozy,many words written
Warm and Cozy,Yea... that's what I'm doing here.
Warm and Cozy,"mmmm,,,,, this actually looks interesting. Doubt I'll have time for it though. And yea it's a 2021 release."
Warm and Cozy,"Mare of Easttown at a 7/10? Id give it a 9.5, its one of the best crime mystery shows in awhile, and Kate Winslet alone makes it worth watching"
Warm and Cozy,"I agree 100% with MoE when I was watching it i felt like I watched this thing 100 times before, not a bad show but I will say it’s one of the most overrated shows of 2021"
Warm and Cozy,"WandaVision was more than okay, but IRYO."
Warm and Cozy,"> Not with you on that

On what exactly, that I called it stylistic, that I listed it under ""outstanding"" or both? 

Probably a case of separating book from adaptation as you said. I haven't read the book myself but according to several reactions I've seen from people who like both (and the disclaimer at the start of each episode emphasizing that it's merely ""inspired by"" these events), you're suppose to take the series as its own thing. There are new characters, their relations are different and none of their backstories (besides Christiane's) are the same as in the book/film apparently. 

Taking the series for what it is I thought it was pretty great. The concept of modernizing the 1970s with a surrealistic approach is fantastic and something we haven't seen before. And out course it's still one of the most daring things on the TV platform to the point where it isn't even available for U.S. viewers on Prime (or at least it wasn't). Plus it still packs an emotional punch showing the consequences of drug use.... I fucks with it. lol."
Warm and Cozy,"what does ""as a John"" mean in this context, american?"

Warm and Cozy,What? 😐
Warm and Cozy,"* The Rain
* The Innocents

Warm and Cozy,The OA
Warm and Cozy,Ehh idk if I'll have time for it to be honest. I feel like the original is enough.
Warm and Cozy,"Indeed, (6 + 7 + 6 + 8 + 7 + 7) / 6 ≈ 6.8, but why don't you weigh ""Originality/Creativity"" more than the other categories? After all:

>Shows categorized based on originality, creativity and innovation (as those are the 3 main factors I look for in TV shows)

And what exactly is ""prod.""? Direction? Editing?

Also: no category for scoring/music... Have you no decency? Or actual hearing loss?

>I also remove 1.0 point whenever I don't finish something

Why not just subtract 1 point per unwatched episode - this way you can get into negative numbers when something is *really* awful, especially when rating 20+ episode network nonsense..."
Warm and Cozy,"What a shitty way to say, “You might also like *Wonder Egg Priority*”"
Warm and Cozy,Agreed.  She was great.
Warm and Cozy,so many words... so many fuckin' words lol.
Warm and Cozy,"Yeah, it is 20 1-hour long episodes. But I actually looked forward each week to the new episodes, and it’s rare for a show to have that effect on me."
Warm and Cozy,"    > Mare of Easttown:
    originality/creativity: 3/10 
    writing (plot & cha): 8/10 
    writing (dialogue): 7/10 
    acting: 10/10 
    visuals/cinema: 7/10 
    production: 7/10 
    rating: 7.0 out of 10

So, for all the reasons I've already said there's no way I would give Mare of Easttown a 9.5. I do agree that it is probably the best detective-mystery of the year so far though, but that might say more about how creatively starved that sub-genre has been since the days of True Detective and The Missing. Or I don't know maybe my favorite detective shows were the ones in a long line-up of typical offerings that pushed the envelop a bit.

But as I mentioned Mare of Easttown is a well put together show, but its goals steer towards precision without much thought of offering something new, and if you read my 'NB' in the opening statement or you're familiar with my posts, you'll know I have an issue with that. hehe."
Warm and Cozy,"Personally, I was surprised how good it was - and fell also in the trap to almost dismiss after the first episode. Really creative take."

Warm and Cozy,Its bad?
Warm and Cozy,"Have you watched Magicka Madoka btw?

Wonder Eggs setting and premise is basically taken from there"
Warm and Cozy,What about The White Lotus? Also from HBO
Warm and Cozy,"> why don't you weigh ""Originality/Creativity"" more than the other categories?

mmm.... nah. It just works better (in my head) if it's equally it own essential. A show can have an original idea, but bad writing, or vice-versa... but i still would want to give points for the idea itself, on equal grounds with everything else such as writing, acting and visuals. 

> And what exactly is ""prod.""?

Production is all the other stuff that can be taken into consideration like sets, costumes (mostly for period dramas), designs (especially for animated stuff), music/ost, editing, make-up sometimes etc. Occasionally one of the things I listed will stick out, like the soundtrack on Yasuke, or the editing on Sexify... I just use ""production"" to give nod points to those. Shows with bigger budget will get higer points for production of course but low buget shows that still manages to be effective and convincing with limited budget also gets high points for production. 

> Why not just subtract 1 point per unwatched episode - this way you can get into negative numbers when something is really awful, especially when rating 20+ episode network nonsense...

Ok this.... this makes a lot of sense. lol. I doubt i'll ever get a negative score on anything though lol. I mostly watch shows with 8-10 episodes... shit sometimes 6. Plus I watch 4 episodes of every single show before I decide whether or not I want to quit."
Warm and Cozy,"> “You might also like *Wonder Egg Priority*”

I wasn't trying to say this at all. Wonder Egg Priority has nothing in common with Mare of Easttown, it's just *better* (even with that underproduced OVA for an ending). 🤷"
Warm and Cozy,"Agreed. The 1st two episodes were kinda boring, but it got so much better."
Warm and Cozy,Legion's setting is a modernization of the 1970s?? I always took it like it just didn't want viewers to know what year it was set in lol.
Warm and Cozy,Terrible. They had major production issues. Not sure why they even released it.
Warm and Cozy,Great! I made this post before I watched that.
Warm and Cozy,">mmm.... nah.

You misunderstand - I wasn't making a suggestion, I was asking a question: why do you emphasise ""originality, creativity"" as ""main factors"" you look for in TV shows when, in the end, you weigh those on an equal level to writing, acting, etc.?"
Warm and Cozy,Thanks for the spoiler
Warm and Cozy,The first two episodes aren't the problem with it.  It's really the last 2.
Warm and Cozy,"Oh because it's the basis of my write-ups really. Let me put it like this... It gets its own category, but really what aspects of a show are original, creative or innovative? It could be any of the other essentials I rate. It could be the writing, dialogue, visuals, production etc. I didn't have to rate originality/creativity by itself... most people don't even think about that when watching shows."
Warm and Cozy,What!? 😐
Warm and Cozy,"I meant it more that it went to a total different way than I expected, and I liked that."
Warm and Cozy,People only hated the last episode because their fan theories didn't come true.
Warm and Cozy,"True enough, I'd regard something like ""originality"" solely as a modifier to more traditional categories - something doesn't necessarily need to be original, to be ""good"" (whatever that word may mean).

Thank you for sharing your thought process."
Warm and Cozy,And because it completely wiped out any consequences for Scarlet Witch and acted like she was the victim of the whole thing *she orchestrated*. Scarlet Witch was *the only actual villain* in the entire series
Warm and Cozy,"> I'd regard something like ""originality"" solely as a modifier to more traditional categories - something doesn't necessarily need to be original, to be ""good""

Exactly! But for me, a person who watches A LOT of television, there has to be original ideas or creative execution or done in a way I haven't seen before for me to really like something or find it praise-worthy. 

That's why I put that in the opening statement, because originality, creativity and innovation is what I look for when I personally watch anything... but the writing, acting, visuals etc. still has to be up to standard. hehe."
Warm and Cozy,Steve Martin and Martin Short are the perfect duo ❤️❤️
Warm and Cozy,Really enjoying this show so far! Between its run time and season length I was left wanting more. Glad we're getting season 2 in good time!
Warm and Cozy,Steven Martin has looked the same my entire life…
Warm and Cozy,"The 1st season was so good, can't wait to get home tonight and start watching S2."
Warm and Cozy,I just finished S1 Sunday night and was wondering when S2 would drop.  Lucky timing on my part!
Warm and Cozy,"I was pleasantly surprised by the first season and as someone once said, “if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.” So I’m glad the show runners agree with that."
Warm and Cozy,My favorite show of 2021. I love Steve Martin and Martin Short and Selena Gomez was a very pleasant surprise! I'm glad they kept it up for season 2!
Warm and Cozy,"Hell yeah, Mabel and the Martins is back!"
Warm and Cozy,"After watching episode one of season 2 I am already surprised at how consistently good this show is. A delicate balance between mystery and humor while keeping the characters at least somewhat relatable and interesting. I would be surprised if this could still work for another season (it happened once more?!) but if they keep the suspense and mystery, I am in for the ride."
Warm and Cozy,Martin Short is fucking hilarious.
Warm and Cozy,"Id say its a show outside my genres. But, watched it with my wife and loved it. Great chill show"
Warm and Cozy,"10 years ago, if you had told me that Steve Martin and Martin Short would be in a TV series with Selena Gomez, I would have said you were crazy. But ... here we are."
Warm and Cozy,Amy Schumer is unironically ruining it
Warm and Cozy,"I am so happy it’s back. I loved season 1 so much, and this season is off to a great start."
Warm and Cozy,Steve is genius. Martin likewise.
Warm and Cozy,Love the trio. But damn can't believe they got horrible actors like Amy Schumer and Cara Delevingne. Season 1 was great. Just finished episode 1.
Warm and Cozy,Starting Season 2 was like seeing a bunch of old friends. There’s something so comforting about this cast.
Warm and Cozy,Haven't seen season 1.. is the show good?
Warm and Cozy,"this is one of those shows that should go on forever, as long as they're all alive"
Warm and Cozy,"Nice to see from the opening narration that Steve Martin has learned the difference between ""famous"" and ""infamous"", and it's only taken 36 years."
Warm and Cozy,"I loved S1. Marty and Steve are such comfort food for my comedy soul. Selena Gomez is so refreshing. She/her team picks such fantastically off-center projects for a ""pop star TM""  The 3 of these peeps have such fun chemistry. I haven't seen S2. Upsetting what i'm reading below... why is Schumer still getting work? I thought the ""women behaving badly"" act died out."
Warm and Cozy,"Tbh I don't get a 'cozy mystery' vibe from this show. It's more faster paced suspense tbh. I really like it to be clear but cozy mystery to me is those Agatha Christie or mid-century English novels, the Hercule Poirot TV show, Knives Out maybe, etc."
Warm and Cozy,Cozy mysteries are perfect
Warm and Cozy,The best part of Season 1 was Sting doing an improv of singing Roxanne. Hilarious.
Warm and Cozy,"So soon? That's great! 

I love that show. 

I hope to se more of Sazz Pataki (Jane Lynch) That was just hilarious. 

I love how they bring in all the old friends and colleges. They clearly just ask people they like working with. You can tell there's a great energy."
Warm and Cozy,"I know I will get flack for this but I wish they didn’t cast Amy Schumer or Cara Delevigne. Seems like an off choice for casting. It put me off from wanting to watch it. I will of course only for the delightful Steve Martin, Martin Short and Selena Gomez. They are all wonderful in this."
Warm and Cozy,"I feel like I am missing something here. I watched S1 in its entirety and it was just .... flat. The mystery wasn't compelling, the dialogue was mediocre, and the performances weren't bad, but definitely felt like a mixed bag. Overall, just seems like less than the sum of its parts. And I absolutely love murder mysteries. 

I believe that its the general editing, or showrunning, just doesn't click for me."
Warm and Cozy,I was instantly irritated to see Amy Schumer…
Warm and Cozy,I see 2 of the 3 Amigos and now I wanna watch. I’m sure they’re still very funny
Warm and Cozy,Surprisingly fun.
Warm and Cozy,Yay looking so forward to it😃
Warm and Cozy,"I wasn't really a fan of either Short or Martin.  I didn't really like the type of comedy they do.

That being said, it could  be because I'm older now, and do appreciate a lot of what they've both done in the past.  I hated the Jerk when I first saw it, but now I find it one of the funniest movies I've seen.

So when I heard of this show (and particularly after watching their Netflix stand up special) I was willing to give it a chance and I must say I was very impressed.

It's not a hard show to follow. It's a great light show to watch - contrary to much of the other TV out there these days.  But it's lightness doesn't take away from it.  It kept both my wife and I guessing until near the end.  We're both looking forward to S2 (which we'll wait until the end so we can binge watch it like last year :) )"
Warm and Cozy,The end of the first season completely put me off. Went from really enjoying it to not really carrying anymore after the season finale.
Warm and Cozy,That girl is so annoying and makes me sleepy in the same time
Warm and Cozy,"Just watched the first episode and already it is very fun. The Amy schumer cameo and what she said is actually funny and meaningful. 

And reboot of Brazzos with a new lead . I could not stop laughing as it is so true."
Warm and Cozy,The best show on television is back!
Warm and Cozy,Ugh the show was great except Martin short is SO ANNOYING
Warm and Cozy,"All the episodes at once, or should I wait to binge?"
Warm and Cozy,"I personally love Amy Schumer in it. Her tv show Life and Beth is incredible. She is funny, heartfelt, and real in it. Michael Cera is also such a pleasant surprise in it. Highly recommend."
Warm and Cozy,"I’m going to be the dissenting opinion, my wife and I could not get into this show. Selena’s acting is flat and the other two are just trying to hard. And this is from a couple that loved Ghost (UK version),  Detectorist,  search party, name a show that blends the right amount of comedy with drama and we’re in. I admit we are bias towards BBC, anything Scandinavian, etc. and find US shows just  dull and not worth our time. Maybe we’ll try again, but not anytime soon. Especially since the sixth season of Peaky Blinders hit Netflix. But in the end, whatever your persuasion, all the best if you love it. Enjoy the new season."
Arang and the Magistrate,Ciaràn Hinds is brilliant.
Arang and the Magistrate,"Ciaran Hinds dies in everything I've seen him in, so I don't expect his character here to have a high chance of survival."
Arang and the Magistrate,Mance Rayder!
Arang and the Magistrate,Is Rory Kinnear gonna give birth to himself from his Rory Kinussy like in Men cuz if so i need to binge s1 fast.
Arang and the Magistrate,Can they add an interesting story?
Arang and the Magistrate,What role is George Constanza gonna be playing??
Arang and the Magistrate,actors i've heard of? in the highest budget show ever made? CRAZY
Arang and the Magistrate,"The first season was so boring and in many cases kind of stupid. Why was the dark lord on a life raft, he just coincidently met up with Galadriel? She just jumped off a ship and decided to swim across the ocean? The elf and the dwarf spent the entire season discussing what good friends they are. The volcano erupted, covered everyone in burning ash but everyone is okay. The army from Nimonea or wherever just happened to show up at a little village at the exact moment necessary with no pretext or reason. It was just stupid moment after stupid moment staring wooden 1 dimensional characters.

I wanted to like it, particularly with all the back lash regarding black elves, but man was it boring and dumb.

I wanted to add a bit of stupidity. The part time black smith enthusiast (turned out to be the lord of darkness or whatever) giving black smithing advice to the greatest black smith of all time, who has been doing it for thousands of years, and the black smith taking the advice, and being like ‘oh yeah, never thought of that’, wtf."
Arang and the Magistrate,"Yeah, but did they hire any good writers?"
Arang and the Magistrate,"bets are open about which one of those will play an asshole character, and which will play a good, strong, empowered and determined one"
Arang and the Magistrate,Can they add some new writers?
Arang and the Magistrate,"Biggest letdown I've ever seen on television. Every single scene and dialogue seems so fake and cringe. Unbelievable they didn't just copy paste the style from the movies, and they could have done pretty much anything story-wise. But when everything looks like plastic it has a long way."
Arang and the Magistrate,"they should ditch the showrunners as they did with picard season 3, but I don't think the show is redeemable"
Arang and the Magistrate,Mance!
Arang and the Magistrate,"I am a die-hard LotR fan, and I have read most of Tolkien's extended works, including the Silmarillion and The History of Middle-Earth. Love the films as well.


I thought Rings of Power was barely watchable. Terrible pacing, forgettable characters, and a wandering story that wasn't interesting in the least. The cinematography was gorgeous, and I liked the cast, but wow was the entire series a complete letdown for me.


I know that there is some conflict around the rights to Tolkien's original story, which I think is why the RoP went ""off-book."""
Arang and the Magistrate,"The show lost me when they went from boat, to full gallop, to battle, to victory all in the span of timecode that was no longer than 10 minutes.  I felt abused by a show I thought was pretty great up until then.  I'm not even sure they CAN win back my viewership when they set up an entire story/season which is working up to something then blow straight through it."
Arang and the Magistrate,Haven't seen Rory in anything since his fateful Black Mirror episode. 🐷
Arang and the Magistrate,Black Mirror ruined Rory Kinnear for me.
Arang and the Magistrate,Not even Ciaran Hinds will be able to save this show from itself.
Arang and the Magistrate,Good actors but no thank you.
Arang and the Magistrate,I'm still not going to watch it.  Season 1 was a bitter disappointment.
Arang and the Magistrate,Has anyone prepared Tanya for the “black”-lash to come? At this point it’s like predicting the weather…
Arang and the Magistrate,Why is everyone suddenly spelling Ciar**á**n Hinds's name with the fada the wrong way around
Arang and the Magistrate,This fan fiction will never be cannon in my eyes. This show was born out of Jeff Bezos lust for money and fame and the writers have an obvious hatred towards Tolkien’s vision. Fuck this show.
Arang and the Magistrate,Is anyone even looking forward this mess of a show anymore?
Arang and the Magistrate,Nah I’m done with this show. No way I come back for season 2
Arang and the Magistrate,"""You killed a Consul of Mordor!"" - Ciaran, probably"
Arang and the Magistrate,"Nice, now replace the showrunners."
Arang and the Magistrate,How wasn't this cancelled
Arang and the Magistrate,Just cancel it already
Arang and the Magistrate,"I found the first season pretty unwatchable, got about halfway through before bailing.  It was too hard to suspend disbelief and I found many of the characters uninspiring; the mediocre writing as well left a lot to be desired.   
To those that stuck with it...best of luck with Season 2!"
Arang and the Magistrate,*Worst fucking deal I’ve ever made.*
Arang and the Magistrate,"Maybe they'll be cast as Doromir and Agathirn in a party of harfoots and the wizard Brindorf to destroy a magical item in ~~The Southlands~~ Mordor.

Jesus Christ this show was a disappointment all throughout but especially at the end of Season 1. Capped by those cringeworthy fan service lines from The Stranger. What a complete and total waste of effort and resources."
Arang and the Magistrate,That show is dead.
Arang and the Magistrate,"It doesn't matter how many great actors they throw at this huge, stinking turd, it's still gonna be a huge, stinking turd!"
Arang and the Magistrate,"Have they got new show runners and/or writers?

If not it doesn't matter how good actors/actresses they get, you can only polish a turd so much."
Arang and the Magistrate,I’m most curious how long Amazon is going to persist with this farce to save face.
Arang and the Magistrate,Sooo is aragorn a black woman now
Arang and the Magistrate,how'd this trash get a second session?
Arang and the Magistrate,Bruh who is still funding this dumpster fire?
Arang and the Magistrate,The bald man is so handsome I fell in love with him when he appeared in penny dreadful.
Arang and the Magistrate,i really hope tanya moody's buds call her 'madeye' or it's all a waste
Arang and the Magistrate,"Whoa, I don't know Rory Kinnear, but I love his dad in all the Beatles movies"
Arang and the Magistrate,I cannot wait to fall asleep to this show. The first season was better than melatonin.
Arang and the Magistrate,Did they add new writers
Arang and the Magistrate,"Presuming middle guys an elf, ladies a hobbit, and old mans a teenage elendil? Calling it now"
Arang and the Magistrate,"Not interested at all. The first season wasn't good. The only thing I liked was the practical makeup/prosthetics for the orcs.

Everything else was just bland high fantasy garbage."
Arang and the Magistrate,"I will at least try season two but my hopes are low, the show is not horrible but it's definitely not good, it barely scratches mediocre for me. Some of the casting, the pacing, the writing, all of it could've been done so much better but I have my doubts these showrunners have the ability to pull it around, we'll see."
Arang and the Magistrate,I was so excited and also very hesitant to watch this lotr adaptation. I got through an episode and a half before realizing it really doesn’t exist in the lotr universe and was more for like little kids. Really disappointed hopefully PJ comes back one day
Arang and the Magistrate,Whattttttt?  Mance Rayder is joining LOTR?
Arang and the Magistrate,"Why was Sauron on a raft? Was he waiting for Galadriel?  Was it a happy accident? Where was he going? His entire backstory and all of his motivations are blown to bits the second that his identity is revealed so what were his motivations for the first 90% of the season? Was he just baiting Galadriel? Why was he on a raft?? WHY WAS HE OUT THERE? Was he leaving??? Did he somehow know she jumped out of a boat and he just set up the entire thing to run into her??

Also, why are the heroes being duplicitous? This is a universe where they (in the show!) establish that there is objective morality and the ends do not justify the means under any circumstance but everyone is acting like they're Game of Thrones characters trying to trick each other and hide their true motives even when it doesn't really serve them or their goals. The actions of the heroes are indistinguishable from the villains. Is the message that even in a binary ""good and evil"" world, there's not actually any good?

Why was he in the middle of the ocean??? What was he doing out there? Why did he go there? Why does he allow himself to be put in jail? Was that intentional? Why was his plan so dependent on other people acting in a very specific way? Can he predict the future? Can he bend them to his will already? If so, why the theatrics and convoluted series of events? WHY IS HE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE OCEAN?? It's almost like the show runners are dumb people who perceive ""smart"" as being complicated with a bunch of steps because they don't see anything else because they can't abstract the motivations of smart people because it's so foreign to them so they just thing it's them plotting out seemingly random things like they can predict the future. Surely that's not the case because there's no way this would be handed off to complete morons right?

Is the simple answer, ""~~because the writers are dumb~~?""

It can't be that! They paid a billion dollars. Why was he out there? Why are the elves dumb? Why are there old elves? Why the fuck are the elves so ugly? Why do they trudge through the snow?? They don't leave tracks in the snow. Why are they sinking into it??? Why is everyone not bowing to/falling in love with Galadriel? Why are the other elves not terrified of her? Why do none of them call her ""aunt"" or ""cousin""? Where is her husband? Did they make her single because they wanted a romantic temptation with the living personification of evil? Is she dumb because she's horny? That seems sexist. Can they not write a woman character without having some of her actions informed by temptation so they made her single? Are they that shallow? Do they think that little of their audience?

WHY IS HE ON A RAFT IN THE OCEAN FOR NO REASON AND WHY DOES ANYTHING ELSE HE DOES MAKE SENSE? WHAT WAS THE PURPOSE OF ALL OF THAT?"
Arang and the Magistrate,Rory Kinnear should appear in more shows/movies
Arang and the Magistrate,We're still getting a season 2 after the crap that season 1 was? ok then.
Arang and the Magistrate,That's nice. Now what will they do to add viewers?
Arang and the Magistrate,"Amazon employees are having a field day by commenting positively about this dumpster fire I see.

Its a ok serie when you don't compare it to the movies."
Arang and the Magistrate,"This will have what to do with Tolkien, again?"
Arang and the Magistrate,"Rory Kinnear is the most underrated actor in Hollywood. If you want a masterclass in acting, watch Penny Dreadful."
Arang and the Magistrate,I'm torn between never wanting to see or hear about RoP again and keep watching just to poke fun of it.
Arang and the Magistrate,"This show isn't as terrible as I thought it would be, definitely delivered far short of it's potential with some daft writing but it also had some genuinely good elements to it (Elrond and Durin were the strong point for me, they were fun to watch and I loved the atmosphere)

There were too many plots going at the one time and the show would constantly take the foot off the accelator when one plot started getting interesting and cut to another plot to spend 20 mins watching less interesting characters deliver dull monologues.  Constantly killing momentum at the exact moment something is about to happen, made the episodes feel like they were padding them out and were afraid to stay with a climatic moment for too long.

I'll give season two a chance, there's just enough there for me to come back to, but if they repeat the same mistakes then I'll probably bail at that point."
Arang and the Magistrate,But why? Did they already pay for the second season or something? Nobody's gonna suffer through another one.
Arang and the Magistrate,So the flop continues....
Arang and the Magistrate,"I find the hate this show gets really weird.

Ciaràn and Rory are great additions though. I haven't really seen anything Tanya Moodie has done"
Arang and the Magistrate,That guy in the middle looks like the host of hot ones
Arang and the Magistrate,Are they hiring better writers?
Arang and the Magistrate,"Another steaming pile of money, I have zero faith in this."
Arang and the Magistrate,Long haired elves or GTFO
Arang and the Magistrate,"I dug this show.  Sorry, my comment is not a pithy negging one-liner."
Arang and the Magistrate,Yea I’d be cautious attaching my name to that pos.
Arang and the Magistrate,"Rory Kinear will never be the same for me after watching Men. If you've seen it, you know why."
Arang and the Magistrate,Rory Kinnear was so bloody great in *Penny Dreadful* that the fact he didn’t win an Emmy (or Eva Green) just shows be how worthless award shows are.
Arang and the Magistrate,From the thumbnail it looked like Colin Robinson. Was curious the direction they’d be going with energy vampires.
Arang and the Magistrate,I think it’s the law that every old times HBO show wit swords and horses has to have hinds in it.
Arang and the Magistrate,Did they add any new writers
Arang and the Magistrate,Great stuff!!
Arang and the Magistrate,We needed Bill Burr though.
Arang and the Magistrate,"Can't have someone in that show doing a half decent Irish accent, so Ciaran can't be a harfoot anywho"
Arang and the Magistrate,Is the Show good?
Arang and the Magistrate,Mance effing Rayder
Arang and the Magistrate,so they didn't cancel season 2. why?
Arang and the Magistrate,"More majestic horse rides, please."
Arang and the Magistrate,Siiiiigh
Arang and the Magistrate,"It doesn't matter what they do going forward, after 5 episodes, I couldn't take it anymore."
Arang and the Magistrate,"Reddit's obsession with this show continues to blow my mind. Even the people who love it don't care about it as much as the people who hate it.

Don't you all get tired of saying the same thing over and over again?"
Arang and the Magistrate,Who cares about this dogwater show. It doesn't deserve the name LOTR
Arang and the Magistrate,"Cool. I won’t watch this season, either."
Arang and the Magistrate,this show sucks ass they're getting wasted
Arang and the Magistrate,Won't change the writing.
Arang and the Magistrate,Maybe the story will be better
Arang and the Magistrate,"Great show, despite what the smoothbrains on reddit think. The visuals and costumes were amazing."
Arang and the Magistrate,"They could add the entire cast of the original movies and I still wouldn't watch this hot garbage. They ruined it before it even got off the ground with those Tolkien-hating show runners and writers who thought they could actually one-up Tolkien with his own world building and characterizations. Galadriel as presented as the heroic female lead of this crap is not just a pale shadow of what is represented in the books, she's a complete bastardization of her. As to the rest...just crap after crap after crap. I definitely won't be coming around for season 2. When it comes to adapting fantasy ""franchises"" such as this and Wheel of Time, Amazon has no clue what they are doing and neither do the show runners they hire."
Arang and the Magistrate,"More diversity castings, whata surprise… just make a portion set in the damn east if you want dark people in lotr, theyre not in the west… the blue wizards could be spotlighted aswell"
Arang and the Magistrate,I think I’m the only one on Reddit that genuinely enjoyed the show.
Arang and the Magistrate,Who cares? Travesty they are going to make another season.
Arang and the Magistrate,"I love how upset people are about this news. ""What? But I *personally do not like this*! Noooo, how can people think differently than me???"
Arang and the Magistrate,Wait. How is there a season 2 after the massive train wreck that season 1 was?
Arang and the Magistrate,"If they want to throw millions away and see it come back, hire whoever made *the Last Of Us*, they have a good story and a good cast"
Arang and the Magistrate,"Well it wasnt exactly better actors this show neede.. Oh well it did, but it needed better writers first and foremost !"
Arang and the Magistrate,Still going to be mid though…
Arang and the Magistrate,Apparently they can't stop until they ruin the next big cultural mythical franchise. I already feel sorry that such a great actor as Ciaran will waste his energy on that guaranteed train wreck.
Arang and the Magistrate,Have they hired new writers yet?
Money Flower,You keep putting these up and they genuinely make no sense at all. A lot of my education is in linguistics and none of this tracks or has any basis in fact. They're merely how writers write dialogue.

But I became very unsure about the pattern!)

***

I believe those patterns are thinking patterns, they tell (in an abstract way) on what a band focuses on.
 
You can view those patterns as different ""exposition roles"", each band tells you something about some layer of the situation.
 
You also can try to ""arrange"" those patterns in a single global ""spectrum"":

- *Scooter < I Like Trains < Assemblage 23 < Ashbury Heights < Elvis Presley* **(in the middle)** < *Coldplay and google-translated Kukryniksy & Kurt Vile < Electric Six*

- *< AWOLNATION and The Rolling Stones and Florence + The Machine and LMFAO < google-translated Mujuice and Aria and and google-translated Piknik and Queen and Hurts*

- *< John Lennon < P!nk and Phil Collins and Monoral and Eurythmics and Bondage Fairies and google-translated Nautilus Pompilius and Philip Kirkorov and Kate Bush < google-translated 7B < ""Weird Al"" Yankovic*

The farther you go, the more a band focuses on a single fact... or the farther you go the more context-independent or conditions-independent or context self-contained or absent of links to outside factors or """"open"""" it gets.

That's just my intuition! (And I don't know how to order some and where to put some)

***

Another version of ""Post Scriptum"": (I apologize for bothering you)
 
All people for me are like heroes (or brilliant characters/ cool people!), no less. I know this is very improbable that I will be able to help anybody with this ""pattern language"", but there's a chance no matter how small and miniscule and absurd sounding **(and it's better than nothing, better than to do nothing at all)**
 
Maybe you can test this theory about speaking patterns with modern day technology such as [GPT-2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformer_(machine_learning_model)#Applications) or [GPT-3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI#GPT-3)"
Money Flower,"I believe you can apply those patterns to music bands, and the fun part is that you can apply the pattern to any piece of any song of the band (it's like a fractal: every piece looks alike)

Bonus with *inane* music band analogies ->

I will quote 

- *P!nk, ""Weird Al"" Yankovic, John Lennon, LMFAO, Eurythmics, Ashbury Heights* **(6)**
- *Florence + The Machine, AWOLNATION, The Rolling Stones* **(9)**
- *Bondage Fairies, google-translated Piknik, google-translated Kukryniksy & Kurt Vile, I Like Trains, Assemblage 23, google-translated 7B* **(16)**

**Katara** = [P!nk eg So What](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FJfFZqTlWrQ) or [What About Us](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClU3fctbGls)

**on low level** [P!nk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pink_(singer)) jumps (-) from a thing to a thing or expands (>) information; *on high level* P!nk quickly characterizes the situation (++) or tells standalone facts (.)

(-) is a wild card, it means no connection or any connection. (>) means just expanding on the thing you already said.

(++) describes something that continuously causes things to happen (benefits/troubles or else), for example a big problem that needs to be solved or a gift that keeps of giving...

(.) is a bunch of standalone facts/events that don't need any context to be understood, every bit of (.)-speech is a self-sustained point... you can split such speech into pieces without losing any context...

- *I guess I just lost my husband, I don't know where he went* (-)(>) *So I'm gonna drink my money, I'm not gonna pay his rent (Nope!)* (-)(>) *I got a brand new attitude and I'm gonna wear it tonight*

on high level (situation): P!nk describes something that causes continous implications for example ""I'm gonna drink my money"" or ""I got a brand new attitude"" or ""I wanna get in trouble, I wanna start a fight"" or just a bunch of standalone facts

Angry Mom,"While HBO Velma is an indisputably awful show, I commend your efforts to try to fix it. You actually tried to make the race changes matter and I respect that. Representation coming from the heart is a good quality to have.

> most would expect him to be a pompous, arrogant, incompetent brat. But Fred turned out to be a natural born leader. He was handsome, charismatic, and understanding. 

Also, definitely already better than what they did to Fred in the show."
Angry Mom,"But the revival really ruined any good aspects of her character. 

Because despite her being such a brat, Rory did work hard. Even if she was the best reporter she would’ve made a great editor with her organization. Her storyline work wise could have been that she realizes her heart isn’t in journalism anymore and not sure what to do. Becoming an editor or writing a book? 

And she is still with Logan even though he is engaged? Like Rory if you want him, tell him! He proposed to you, the ball is in your court!"
Angry Mom,"What I took away from GG is that you can have everything society seemingly deems valuable and evident of a “good life” - wealth, parents who hold you to high standards, the best schooling, a supportive community, etc but life still gets in the way and just because you seemingly have all the assets you need for success, doesn’t mean you’ll be successful. I watched it first as a teen, and again now as an adult, and I see this play out in both Lorelei and Rory’s arcs. I imagine if I have my own kid one day I will see it from Emily’s perspective as well - you can do everything for your kid and they will still mess it up and we just have to accept it and deal with it. Life moves on regardless of whether we’re fulfilling our potential or not, so best not sulk about things or you’ll be miserable and unhappy (as we see with Emily). For white  upper middle class audiences it’s sort of like a “your choices matter more than your surroundings” kind of messaging."
Angry Mom,"When I first watched the show, I was roughly Rory's age, and I thought she was great. A decade or so later I watched it again, and Lorelei was 100% the best. Now I watch it nearing my 40s, and Emily Gilmore is the best character by far.

For me that just speaks to the quality of the writing of the show, that I could always easily identify with some characters regardless of my age. But yeah, looking back now, Rory's kind of the worst."
Angry Mom,"Rory has the worst qualities of both her parents and is a lot more like Christopher than she or Lorelai like to admit, which is especially obvious in the revival with how flaky and immature Rory is. She had zero boundaries when growing up and got everything she wanted regardless of the effect it had on others, which then leads to her expecting the same as an adult. She treats everyone and everything with disdain. 

Rory being such a flawed character makes her more interesting to me. I really enjoyed the revival, but I think it's because I never expected her to have this perfect life that the end of the main series was setting her up for. Her being lost and depressed living out of boxes in her mother's house makes sense because once she grew up and entered the real world, she had to stand on her own two feet which she was never taught to do."
Angry Mom,"Rory is unlikable by season 4, if not earlier. The most frustrating thing about the show is that she rarely (if ever) gets called out for it."
Angry Mom,"Ironically I feel like Lorelai on the other hand becomes more likeable in the later seasons. She's still very immature in Season 1 and her lowest point imo is when she runs away on her wedding day (like at least leave him a voicemail jeez). 

The thing is, unlike most shows like this Gilmore Girls usually doesn't tell you how to feel about someone doing something. You sort of have to judge them for yourself. Not a revolutionary concept but it's definitely the smartest of these CW drama shows."
Angry Mom,"I found Lorelai a lot more likable than Rory. I’m not sure if it was the grandparents or people always telling Rory how smart and wonderful she was but she became spoiled and entitled in a way her mother never was. Lorelai worked for what she got and persevered through the obstacles in her way to build a successful life. Rory melted down the second things didn’t go exactly her way. 

In the revival Rory is the age her mother was when you are first introduced to the characters and she is far less accomplished than her mother despite having the advantages her mother gave up to raise her."
Angry Mom,Chilton Rory was the best Rory.
Angry Mom,"Okay. She's not a role model, that's for sure, but it's also what I appreciate about her. Or more specifically, I appreciate Amy SP's willingness to give those flaws to a protagonist. 

I relate to that feeling of losing interest in someone but lacking the self awareness or guts to cut ties and instead just letting things fall apart. It's something I've experienced from both sides and feels very real even if it's not ""right"". I've also made small justifiable choices that ultimately led me to making much bigger mistakes that weren't clear until they were over and done with and that's how I view most of Rory's big mistakes.

Btw, I think it's gross and completely inaccurate for you to say she ""coaxed"" a ""happily married"" Dean into cheating with her. It takes two to tango and it was just as much his decision as it was hers, all along telling her that his marriage wasn't working out. I'm not absolving Rory of responsibility, but just [watch this scene again](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHm9sPrk8dc&list=PLqfJ1GkbzerGIXZkFV42BurTVRo-ljfy7&index=130) and tell me who coaxes whom."
Angry Mom,"Agreed. They repeatedly (especially early on) try to play Rory off as little miss perfect. But if you pay attention you'll realize that she rarely does any of the great things they attribute to her on-screen. She struggles at Chilton for a bit but then magically catches up and eventually ties with Paris for valedictorian. A similar thing happens at Yale and then she almost has a break down when told to drop a class. In one episode Rory gets into an argument with Taylor and claims to always be heavily involved with town activities. Maybe I'm wrong but I feel like when she does take part it is either helping Lane do something mundane or helping her mom. Also, I'm surprised that the OP didn't mention how Rory totally and quite cruelly destroyed that ballet dancer with her news article. Even her grandparents knew it was cruel, but they were proud of that fact. I've said this before and I'll say it again, Rory Gilmore is the worst person in a family that (Lorelai excluded) pride themselves in being awful to others."
Angry Mom,"Had to watch this show too many times with my wife.  Ugghh.  Yes Rory is a great student but an awful person.  I'd rather see the Lane Show, she was way more fun & interesting than Rory.
GG was annoying mostly cuz *everyone* in that town did snappy rapid fire dialog."
Angry Mom,"Yep. She's the worst. The show constantly sets itself up for interesting positions for the Gilmores and yet undermines them:

* In the very first episode she briefly suggests she won't go to the privileged Prep School Chilton, given that she's met a nice boy in town in Dean. She ultimately gets everything she wants in this scenario with no consequences. School's magically paid for, she gets to keep Dean until she's bored with him, and she remains Star's Hollow's golden child despite not even going to their public schools. 

* You're correct that their relationship with money is problematic throughout the show. Their family is RICH. Rory knows she can float through jobs. Undoubtedly she is bequeathed a ton of money by her grandparents and can make weird school and career choices. Suddenly her father ALSO becomes ultra-rich just so he can serve as Luke's foil. Characters aren't shown to struggle financially at all-- everything just works out for them. And yet somehow she's supposed to be such an outsider at Yale.

* The show makes OVERT efforts to make Logan unlikeable. He cheats on her, he's privileged AF and flaunts it, his friends are written as shallow fratboys and the more redeemable characters like Jess and Luke see through him. Logan dips out for a year and keeps stringing her along. He has virtually no relationship with her Star's Hollow life, barely interacts with Lane, etc. It seems like they're setting him up NOT to be her match, but the relationship just keeps dragging on (and into the revival). There's a moment where Marty confesses his feelings to her, she says she likes Logan, and Marty-- who she actually has a ton in common with--  says, ""I can guess why"" or something to that effect. Yup, you nailed it, Marty. Rory is shallow AF. 

* She initially sees nothing wrong with cheating with Dean on his wife. 

Let's not forget that Lorelai is also pretty shitty for the way she fucks over Max and Luke. But I agree that Rory is the worst."
Angry Mom,"To be fair though, the whole revival should not be counted, cause it was a shitshow. It felt like a parody of GG, exaggerating the worst parts of literally every character."
Angry Mom,"I identify with Rory - trying to find herself, not really knowing where or how to fit in, just trying to make her way through life one event at a time and mostly being driven by the people around her. 

The only difference is that I was very self aware of that as it was happening, and she appears very much to not be self aware. She thinks of herself as a strong powerful woman, because that was the model drilled into her by Lorelai even when she was only pretending it, and so she won't let herself admit the uncertainty she feels. It drives her to anger, and she directs that anger at the people around her rather than allowing any sort of self reflection."
Angry Mom,"I've seen this show way too many times from my wife putting on to fall asleep to, so I've not only seen it multiple times, but I've also absorbed in on an unconscious level. 

The thing is... they're pretty much ALL terrible people except for Lane.   I don't know much about the creator, but this show feels like it was written by a lizard person trying to pretend that they understand human interactions. Everyone acts like they're about to go through a second-act revelation to become a better person... but that never happens. The parents continue to be condescending and racist. Rory's BF's are also mentally abusive. Rory and Lorelai are both self-absorbed in different ways. Sookie doesn't want kids to eat cupcakes at a birthday party. Her husband lied about a vasectomy. Luke acts like a snot, sometimes he's cool, but he really fucked up how he handled things between Lorelai and his daughter's mom. God bless poor Lane. Kirk too, but honestly, he's kind of shit too but I still like him. 

The weirdest thing is how it starts off with a normal theme of growing up sheltered by wealth is unhealthy and then turns into a weird fetishization of UNBRIDLED privilege, wealthy, and masquerade sex parties/art installations in the woods. Sweet zeus, have mercy on my soul."
Angry Mom,"(The show knows this. She is very much a product of her circumstances. It's weird to hyper-focus on this like the creators, actors, and writers had no clue they were writing an unlikable character that you root for anyway.)"
Angry Mom,"I agree that Rory sucks. Like, really sucks. She's super selfish and is incapable of self-reflection. However, I \*do\* think that much of her issues stem directly from Lorelai, and I do disagree that the worst part of the show was their relationship. Having a mother who does not mother you but treats you like a friend is the GD worst. I personally think Rory is totally justified to pettily lash out at Lorelai as she ages, because she learned her suckery from how much Lorelai sucks. They both really, totally, suck.

And, look, yes, Rory is a shitty girlfriend, but all of the men in her life are shitty too.

Dean is too possessive. Yeah, okay, he was picking up on the Rory/Jess vibes, but the obsessive calling and lashing out was inappropriate.

Jess is distant and mean and freaks out on Rory when she declines sex. Yuck. At least he grows and changes... but... yuck.

Logan is your typical spoiled rich kid who expects everything to go his way, loves to mentally toy with Rory, and cheats and is an all around POS.

Marty is an OG Nice Guy. Marty can fuck the fuck right off.

&#x200B;

PS. YES. I can't believe they did Lane like they did. Can we just have a show where they make Lane the famous drummer she deserves to be, and never gets with dumb Zach? Max Medina, Richard Gilmore, and Sookie can be there too."
Angry Mom,"She is, but Lorelai is a terrible role-model."
Angry Mom,"Gilmore Girls, whilst very entertaining at times, has a very high volume of extremely unlikeable/despicable characters. It speaks volumes that ""villains"" like Lorelai's parents and Paris come across as far more likeable than either of the main two leads.

Unpopular opinion but Luke and Lorelai were a terrible couple who were completely wrong for each other. I felt sorry for their fans having to watch that absolute car crash unfold on screen. It was just painful to watch. I don't think there was much chemistry there either."
Angry Mom,I think both Lorelai and Rory are horrible people. Rory is probably the way she is because her mother wasn't that great a person to begin with.
Angry Mom,Just here to say Let's Go TEAM JESS!
Angry Mom,"I found Rory relatable in the first two seasons but then it started to go downhill. She's got her little privilege bubble and she never learned to really tolerate distress, in part because her mother's own distress lead her to try to shield her daughter from any discomfort. That said, she's very realistic. I went to college with lots of girls like Rory. And Paris. Though honestly, I find Paris more relatable.

And the end of the day, the best teen on that show was Lane, and the writers kind of did her dirty.

Also, Rory should have gone out with Marty. He was better than all the other guys. But I get it, we all had a Marty in our lives at one point. She should have given him a shot."
Angry Mom,"This SHOW. I watched the entire thing in 2019 and thought it was awful, but for some reason watched every single episode and have no idea why.

Rory especially was idolized by everyone who met her for no reason. The entire show was written like 'Rory is just so smart and so pretty and so perfect, and you know because the characters always talk about how smart and pretty and perfect she is. Art.'"
Angry Mom,"I have this problem with a huge chunk of early 2000s TV.  Beneath their surface charm and wittiness, the main characters are selfish, spoiled assholes who often cheat (because it’s a sexy and dramatic plot point). They have friends who are often dealing with way worse problems, but do nothing but provide moral support for the protagonist, exactly like Lane. Looking at you, Veronica Mars

EDIT: Oh by the way, it goes without saying that the protagonist who gets everything is a skinny white girl, and the long-suffering friend who does nothing but support is often a POC"
Angry Mom,ITT people complain about characters being written with flaws.
Angry Mom,"Lorelai is much worse than Rory. She's just a truly terrible person.

Also

>So you may think “well at least she’s nice to her grandparents”. Oh sure, when it’s convenient for her. Like her granddad hooking her up with an important interview only for her to lose her shit on him because she feels put on the spot... you’re welcome? 

He deceived her. He said that he just wanted to take her for a tour of the Yale campus, without any pressure to actually apply, and then he sprung this pre-arranged interview on her out of nowhere at the last minute. His plan was to try to trick her into applying to Yale by lying to her and making it to awkward for her to refuse, instead of just perhaps asking her. If he had *asked* her to do the interview, she would have said yes! There was no need to try to manipulate her into it. Richard was in the wrong there and Rory was in the right."
Angry Mom,"You missed the part where she is so fixated on going to Harvard (only to later decide that she's going to Yale) that she needs to go to an expensive school that only extremely rich people can afford to increase her changes of going to Harvard.

Lane was the good one, but got stuck with the doofus because the actor who played her boyfriend left the show."
Angry Mom,"For me it really depends on the angle ASP was trying to take with her storytelling. Was she insinuating that Rory was the golden child her family perceived her to be, or was she rising above that, illustrating a girl who ruled her own world but who was actually very out of touch and just a small fish in a big pond. With good writing, it is hard to tell if the author is aware of the flaws of the character they've created and factoring them into the overall message, or, if they have tried to make the character genuinely unflawed and failed.

In this case, I would lean toward saying ASP intentionally gave Rory flaws despite her perfect image and reputation with the people in her life. She's such a skilled writer I find it hard to believe that the disparity between Rory's surface image and her true character was not intentional. I believe the message ASP was trying to send is one about maturation and growth and the general notion that growing up is not smooth or easy. In this case, the initial construction of Rory's character as perfect and unflawed is actually great writing, it's a clever technique to be able to highlight the reality that no one is perfect. Through making the foundations of Rory's character generically 'good', she was then able to slowly poke holes in that image with every messy, ugly, humane situation Rory found herself in. Through situations like Rory's torment over Dean vs Jess, missing her mom's graduation, sleeping with Dean, and dropping out of Yale, ASP showed the viewers that even though this girl was viewed as generally 'good' by everyone in her life, she still made ugly mistakes, she still hurt people and made bad choices and acted on impulse, because she is human. The deconstruction of her 'good-girl', perfect image says to the viewer that if Rory Gilmore is flawed, everyone is flawed. There is no such thing as perfect. Messing up in life is okay, and it is how you come back from negative experiences that defines you, rather than the experience itself. Rory got herself into some pretty ugly situations that showed some poor decision-making, but after every one, she tried hard to make things right and to redeem herself. That is what makes her a good person in the overarching context of the show. Not that she is immune to messing up, but that she shows remorse and cares about fixing it when she does.

It's easy as a viewer to hold the characters you love to an unrealistic standard that you would never hold someone to in real life. After all they exist for your entertainment, and because of that it's more comfortable for you to watch someone be idyllic, be all the things that you're not. I'm guilty of first being attracted to Rory's character for that reason. She is self-disciplined, level-headed, patient, hard-working, all things that I naturally am not. I put her on a pedestal because I used her as a medium through which I could fantasise about being the type of person she is. But that isn't a fair way to judge anyone. Though a fictional character, ASP didn't create Rory to be anyone's muse for the person they subconsciously wish they could be. She created Rory to represent a coming-of-age girl and all the baggage and inevitable pain and rockiness that comes with it. If anyone thinks Rory is a brat because she made mistakes of which you or I or anyone have made similar throughout our lives, then they are watching the show to feel comfortable and appeased, whereas the show is meant to be received with an open and realistic mind. Ironically, people's dislike for Rory's character as it evolves speaks to nothing but the fact that ASP is a brilliant writer. To create a character that transcends being a 'character' in their unrealistic glossiness and becomes a relatable human being that makes you uncomfortable because you see yourself in her, is a very rare ability. I hope that if ever ASP sees this negative backlash about Rory, she feels even more accomplished."
Angry Mom,"Thanks for the post. I’m currently on season 5 and  I can’t stand that little brat who is so ungrateful and so mean to  people  Iin her life when they face her with the reality. In example, when Lorelai comforted her after she slept with Dean carelessly. She didn’t care if he was married or she  had real feeling for him. She just couldn’t face with the reality  that she wasn’t the most smart and beautiful and her jokes were not really witty  after landing at Yale. I’m not a huge fan of Lorelai either. She is doing bunch of racist remarks all the time and don’t even make me start on her first world people problems."
Angry Mom,"Rory and Lorelai are both shitty persons.   They are manipulative to their family and friends and uses them to get what they want.  

Lorelai is mad at the parents because they wanted more for her than to be a teenage Mother.   But still accepts money, gifts...   Then she's furious to have to spend one evening a week with them.  She also uses Luke to get free stuff and repairs.  

Rory always gets what she wants without working.  Food, coffee, private school, university, expensive clothing, car....   She cheats on poor Dean, leave one boyfriend for a rich guy.   Then dump the rich guy for no good reason.

That show makes me mad.   Remember how Suki got pregnant because her husband lied about getting a vasectomy?"
Angry Mom,"She was a teenager, teenagers are generally cunts."
Angry Mom,"Huh, my ex was OBSESSED with this show. Probably why she was such a piece of shit in similar ways."
Angry Mom,Rory Williams on the other hand. Has a gun...
Angry Mom,"Sorry, but I am so tired of this take. I love the show and the characters and it’s weird to me that people claim to be fans but hate at least half of its appeal."
Angry Mom,"Rory is hot, I will hear no more of this slander!!!"
Angry Mom,"Such a lame, by now overused meme to rag on Rory. Yeah she's flawed and she has a period in the series where she 'goes off the rails'  - ie gets drunk on the privilege of her family. It's a believable development for someone who's grown up goody two shoes, good at school and with many academic and work possibilities to find some way to 'rebel' - and by the way, it's not a flaw of the writing that a character is not sympathetic all the time, it's a strength. Rory is more interesting because of her weakness for douchebag Logan."
Angry Mom,It's called Gilmore girls but she show is about Rory and the fact that she was had when her mother was 16 out of wedlock which was pretty taboo back then. I think her issues stem from wrestling with that identity. I'm on my first rewatch and my only issue is that it's the same story over and over and over again throughout the seasons.
Angry Mom,"I think Rory has still been my only small crush when it comes to tv shows/movies. The only one still. But then again, that crush came about with season 1 from what I remember. Yeap I got tired as hell with her behaviour after it, but I just remember the crush, because I've never had one before/after when it comes to movies / tv shows. Not a single one. 

But besides these whole Rory hate posts, which this isn't the first one of, the show was still one of the most comfy, witty adorable things for few  first seasons. One of those truely unique things, like Pushing Daisies. I wish there were more just... comforting shows like these. Ted Lasso, while being way more light hearted than these, is the only recent example I can think of."
Angry Mom,"The Take on youtube had a similar... take on it this week. You should check it out and have fun memeing ""Pointing Leonardo DiCaprio"" irl at the screen. Here's the link https://youtu.be/dKXTJvR1COw"
Angry Mom,I was okay with her until the revival.  She's just awful there.
Angry Mom,Did they change writers at some point? Because Rory starts out so sweet! I can't even picture first season Rory doing those things.
Angry Mom,"She is a teenage girl who, messes up, overreacts, tries new things, boys, education, life goals.
To me she seems like someone who wants to do too much and make everyone happy, and when it doesn't work she, runs or hides.
But to say that she is a horrible person because of it, I suspect would doom most teenagers to label."
Angry Mom,"I just started watching the show a month ago, and I'm currently on S5, and everytime I see Rory, I go ARGGGHH, and for a second I thought I'm the only one who can't seem to stand her holier-than-thou, awww look I'm such a good kid, character."
Angry Mom,"Late to the party, but how did they do Lane dirty? I binge watched it a couple of years ago, and then watched the revival about 1 year ago, and it seems like Lane is happy with her small town rocking out with her best friends. Nothing wrong with that! What am I missing?"
Angry Mom,"As bad as the characters in the show can be most of them are real characters with good points, bad points, they make good decisions and bad decisions. I really do hate Emily Gilmore, for example because there is astonishingly little to redeem her despite a few good moments. As time went on Richard became and absentee asshole of a parent into a conniving sneak that I wanted to slap the shit out of at every turn. While I even grew to hate Dean after a while, becoming a small town asshat who made mistake after mistake and blames the world for his troubles, the biggest mistake is Rory. 

Rory became stuck up astonishingly quickly, she uses people at every turn, she gravitates purely towards the worst options for men following her initial relationship with Dean, which was incredibly sweet and genuine. I loved the early years of Gilmore Girls and never made it much into Yale when I first watched it and i am regretting it to the ends of the earth now. Rory is, in short, a piece of fucking shit as she gets older and realizes that her decisions just start leading her down a road of failure and self-interest. I think, in fact, that I can pinpoint the moment that things begin changing. It's the Yale visit with the uncalled for interview with admissions. From that point on it's like the writer(s) decided to change Rory's character to be manipulated at the core level. Had Rory followed the plan and went to Harvard, got away from Paris, got away from her family, including Lorelai, and the town in general she would have been a better person. She'd have had a more concentrated college experience, she'd have less enabling and more problem solving. The distance would have given her more appreciation for her relationships. She'd have taken less advice that led her to rethinking her character and entertaining events and experiences she had no interest in. The biggest thing though is that she'd have had far less contact with her grandparents who, successfully, manipulate her at every goddamn turn. 

Honestly I had intentions to watch through the entire series and then the Revival but I am honestly over it because all the things I feel in love with are vanishing more and more with each episode. It's like watching a beautiful candle burn and melt away the beautiful image into a melt mess of wax and disgust."
Angry Mom,"What I hate most about her, is that she is always treated like Miss Perfect and never have to face real consequences. If she does something wrong, it's fastly forgotten. 

I like Lorelai and Emily a lot. They are both struggling and making mistakes, but they have to face the social consequences for it and you can see a character development. In addition both are trying hard to improve. 

Rory just gets worse over the time, but is in the impression of others still awesome. There are some ups and downs in her relationship with others, but in the longrun everyone loves her.

&#x200B;

I especially hate it how she treats Lorealai, but also her grandparents. She is an ungrateful brat and that her live didn't turn out as expected in the mini series, satisfied me somehow. Besides studying, she never worked hard for anything. Maybe, I'm a little bit biased because I had to work for my dreams and payed/paying my studies on my own."
Angry Mom,"Has anyone else noticed how the town treated Rory like she was the only child to live there ever? Watching the show now as a parent, I cringe. Lorelai never corrects Rory's spoiled behavior. And Rory doesn't act 16. She acts more like 12 or 13. It's very strange in retrospect."
Angry Mom,"I never liked her when I first watched it. Now that I am rewatching it and seeing her through a lenses of a real journalist, she makes me cringe. She is an absolute disaster at work and cannot take criticism because of her little, manufactured bubble. Someone like her would have been eaten in true journalism and would not have survived a day. Her whole family and the town is severely problematic in the way they acted towards her. Thankfully, the show is charming as otherwise it would not have been bearable."
Angry Mom,"Full disclosure: I absolutely HATE this show. My sister watched it when we were kids, and my wife loves it, so I have to deal with it more than I'd like. 

Agreed; Rory, and many other characters are awful people that are portrayed to be good. The thing that gets me is the way the characters talk. It's like they all have the same vocal patterns(? Not sure how to say it). It's like every character speaks in the same meter, inflection, and has the same condescendingly pedantic way of speaking. I always found it annoying, but once I realized why I found it annoying, the whole thing became insufferable. Every scene between main characters plays out as a puppet show with the same narcissistic conclusion of ""Lol OMG I'm sooooooo whitty!"" Maybe its a cultural difference between me and the writers, but all the characters come off as insincere, narcissistic, and I can't find them interesting."
Angry Mom,"it's hard to think that someone who was an editor of the yale daily news and went on to report on the barack obama campaign wasn't at least _somewhat_ an interest to publications for another job. i know the campaign one isn't that big of a deal alone but the connections she could've made in that role would've opened doors.

the revival was trying to say that the medium was dying thanks to online publications taking away readership therefore funding cuts etc (i think. it's been a while) but someone in her position (ivy educated, experienced) should've been hired by an existing print organisation already _or_ on the ground floor of one of the new online. it doesn't make any sense why someone like her would've been floundering around.

i guess the point is that that's where amy sherman wanted her. had all the doors open for her through her families wealth and connects and threw them away like her mother. at least it's on theme."
Angry Mom,The revival really showed how growing up as someone who was so special hurt her.  She faced no real adversity and always expected to be the golden child.  We saw that when she had a total breakdown when Mitchum didn't give her a good review.  She expected everything to be handed to her because she works hard and is special and life doesn't work like that.
Angry Mom,"Right.  Lorelei came from wealth and ran away from it to a small town.  Rory came from poverty and wanted the lifestyle that wealth could provide.  The private school, the ivy league college, the life Logan had.

None of the characters are good or bad.  They are just doing what they want and what they think is right."
Angry Mom,"> Now I watch it nearing my 40s, and Emily Gilmore is the best character by far.

I was with you up until this.  As a parent nearing their 40s I am only more baffled people think positively about Emily Gilmore.  If anything I have less patience for someone who treats anyone not in their social strata as borderline less than human."
Angry Mom,"Her character ""broke"" the second she learned to say no.

I don't mean consent wise, I mean helping other people wise. After she learned how to put her foot down and stop being taken advantage of, she never once really anyone after that. 

Every single instance of someone asking her for help was a no and then she whined and sabotaged everything when she was forced to help out.

That's what happened. She was the golden child of the community, but she never once learned to how to be nice or kind or helpful back. without a whole lot of arm twisting."
Angry Mom,"That is the biggest load of crap. She went to private school, she got Ivy League Education, she was editor of Yale newspaper and she had all the help she wanted. She could have gone to grad school, she was offeted a job as a teacher at Chilton, she could have worjed her way up. Her problem was that she felt entitled to get what she wanted, anything else was beneath her. I really despised her from the moment she said to Logan ""doesn't your family know I'm a Gilmore, my ancestors came over on Mayflower"" like that is by what you judge a person. Lorelai didn't raise her like that. She left that world. I believe she should be less of a friend to Rory and play the ""mom card a lot more"". But Rory got that attitude from her grandparents and it came out the most while dating Logan. I loved that his family thought of the Gilmores, what the Gilmores thought of everybody less fortunate than them.
Rory is a victim of an enflated ego and self worth.
If somebody like her can't make anything of herself and all that privilige she had, who can?"

Angry Mom,"That's one of my least favorite aspects of media. When the show itself seems to disagree with me. A character being obnoxious is fine. Sometimes, I think it's a bit silly when people say they can't enjoy this or that show, because one or more of the characters is rude or something. If that's the intent, it generally doesn't bother me. Because I feel like I am getting the intended experience.

But it drives me crazy when a character is just super obnoxious, but it's clear that the writers don't expect you to feel that way, and constantly put in little moments which seem to defend the character.

She's not the worst example of it, but Carla from Scrubs is an example. I actually like her a decent amount, depending on the season. But there's plenty of times where I feel like she is really obnoxious, yet the show doesn't seem to want to call her out on it. I feel like the writers were much more harsh on JD, Elliot, and Dr. Cox when it came to their flaws. Turk seems to have fewer flaws than the other characters, at least in my opinion. But when he *does* do something wrong, the show is still quick to call him out for it. But Carla seems to get a free pass most of the time. So it's extra hard to tolerate her when she's being annoying, because I feel like the show expects me to still like her in that moment."
Angry Mom,I think season 7 (especially the last several episodes) redeemed her somewhat.
Angry Mom,"People forget her mother also praised her too much. And the others in the town. Doesn't matter how many affairs she's involved she's still always the nice girl with a ""halo"" as Lorelai said"
Angry Mom,Giving flaws to a protagonist is one thing. But having someone like Rory as the main character is another completely. She's no protagonist and quite an awful person.
Angry Mom,"The show doesn't portray her as little miss perfect, the show portrays everyone else's perception of her as little miss perfect. I think the show is pretty honest with the fact that she's definitely not."
Angry Mom,"Logan did not cheat on her. They were broken up. I hated how Rory weaseled herself into his life. I guess he was the first boy that wasn't pursuing her. Going as far as offering a friends with benefit kind of deal to him( hoping he could not live without her once he gets a taste, it wouldn' t work in real life) than whining ""I thought i could do it, but I can't, I need a boyfriend.""  Dean was "" her boyfriend first"" so she saw nothing wrong with sleeping with him. Same I guess with Logan , he was her boyfriend first , so what if she had an affair with engaged man. I think that she thought that the same thing would happen second time around. From casual sex to relationship.
I hate that they got her pregnant by Logan.  The moral of this show is , be a stuck up whore and you're going to end up on top anyway."
Angry Mom,I thought Emily's arc was actually pretty good but it was essentially the only thing about the revival I liked. Don't even mention how dirty they did poor Paris!
Angry Mom,"It was entirely written and directed by the show creator and her husband. So I'm not sure why we shouldn't count it. I could see an argument against counting season 7 since the creator wasn't involved. But As much as I hated rory in the revival, its the character the creator of the character imagined."
Angry Mom,Haven't seen it since it first came out. Wasn't half an episode just a shitty play that Stars Hallow put on?
Angry Mom,"Kirk is the only redeeming humor in this show.

Watched it with my wife and didn't get the appeal. A bunch of miserable people being mean to each other."
Angry Mom,"But surely this kinda falls apart because lots of people... dont root for her? Like, if one of the main characters of your show sucks but we still want them to succeed on some level, or at least work on themselves, then fine. But I would definitely argue that people dont see Rory Gilmore and, say, Bojack Horseman in the same way.

Also this quote from the creator:

> ""You can't go into any story-breaking process thinking, 'What if they come off as unlikeable?' You just gotta break the story because if you know who your character is, the story will tell you."" 

... heavily implies that Rory's complete lack of likability is *not* intentional, rather they just didn't know or care. Having said that I haven't seen every episode, so if there is evidence to suggest that Rory as a sucky character is intentional then feel free to share."
Angry Mom,"You left out her father, Christopher, a case of clueless arrested development who was just a deadbeat dad."
Angry Mom,"It’d be hard to be capable of self-reflection when every time you try to talk to your mom, you get a dated cultural zinger instead of an earnest reply."
Angry Mom,"I'm with you until Marty. He takes space from her when he decides she doesn't share his interest, then she FORCES him to hang out again, oblivious to his discomfort. At which time she FORCES him into uncomfortable positions hanging out with Logan's awful friends. When he confesses his feelings, she says she likes Logan, Marty's like ""no shit"" and we don't hear from him for a long time until he's with Lucy. At which point he screws up and potentially still holds a candle for her, but he's hardly been stalking her or harassing her with the /r/niceguys routine."
Angry Mom,"> 
> And, look, yes, Rory is a shitty girlfriend, but all of the men in her life are shitty too.
> 
> Dean is too possessive. Yeah, okay, he was picking up on the Rory/Jess vibes, but the obsessive calling and lashing out was inappropriate.

All of her ""boyfriends"" were either teenagers or immature young adults. Of course, a 16 year old boy isn't going to know fully formed ideas of how to date and be with someone romantically.

The problem is that that's primarily who we saw her with as she was those ages too."
Angry Mom,"Lane, Max, Sookie, Luke but not Richard ., Richard sucked & was terrible and in my opinion a big indicator for Rory’s downfall too…Richard & Emily both looked down upon others that they considered not to be in their „league“ (f.ex. the way they treated Dean at dinner to „bad“ for Rory bc he wasn’t Ivy League material), they thought they were better than others - 1st class people .. and they passed on that perspective on Rory (other than Lorelai that tried to separate from their wealth & lifestyle) that they are Gilmores and others are beneath"
Angry Mom,This they are two peas in a pod both awful. Also they were so awful to Emily when she just wanted to spend time with them and help. She basically had to pay them to spend time with them like wtf was that. It’s your mom and grandma you should want to spend time with them without having to make a deal.
Angry Mom,I hated him when he first came to town and mouthed off to Lorelai but as time went on he matured and became my favorite male character next to Luke.
Angry Mom,[deleted]
Angry Mom,"Yeah like have you ever met a teenager? I think the show is quite good. It can be frustrating to watch people mistreat each other, but that happens every day. People are complex and not one dimensional."
Angry Mom,"ITT about how bad of a person a particular character is, people complain about a character's flaws.

What exactly did you expect when you opened this thread? A character can be written with flaws. And watchers are allowed to dislike that character as a person due to those flaws..."
Angry Mom,Flaws are great. But we don't like Rory because she sucks as a person. Every villain in history has flaws. Does that mean we should like them all becuse they're a person with flaws?
Angry Mom,He wasn't though because he ended being right and getting her everything she wanted.
Angry Mom,"Lorelai rather lived poor & worked hard to work her way up .. she accepted gifts when it was in Rory’s interest like the college tuition bc she wanted only the best for her daughter but for herself she didn’t?
She payed her parents the money back that she borrowed, she was super uncomfortable at her graduation when Emily made expensive „gifts“
She tried to separated her life from her parents that looked down on people they didn’t considered „in their league“, from the wealth & lifestyle.. f.ex when She & Rory went backpacking in Europe and stayed in hostels Emily offered to pay for there hotels but she is down to earth and doesn’t accept their offer.

Also about Luke ..it took her season to find out that she loves Luke - she was immature in the beginning but grew with every season & she was also there for Luke whenever he needed it she didn’t just „used him“ .. she was his best friend and Luke would’ve been super lonely without her."
Angry Mom,She was 32 in the revival and at her all time worst though lol
Angry Mom,She became an adult and got worse though so your comment makes no sense.
Angry Mom,loving this show doesn’t make you a bad person.. many people like they show but despise ROry and other characters.. they show is realistic & entertaining for many people and doesn’t reflect your own behavior
Angry Mom,"Same. It drove me crazy. The show has funny, quick sarcastic humour, but my ex loved the show and seemed to worship Rory. Bothered me so much lol. Sebastian Bach helped me get through it though. Just kept picturing him smoking a joint with a bunch of bugs and shit it in (TPB if you miss the reference - a show with actual good people in it)"
Angry Mom,"I think its something that people notice over the years, i would say at one point GG was my Wife's favorite show, and has watched it over the many years we have been together, and in turn I have watched it through a couple of times. The most recent time we watched it (last year some time) my Wife seemd to have a realization that Lorali and Rory are both not good people, but prior to that she loved everything about the show. It became one of those shows where she cared more about the supporting cast than the actual ""Gilmore Girls"", and something she can still enjoy but she definitely watches it with a more critical eye now.

I on the other hand always dislked the show for the way they talked with every single piece of dialogue being snappy and drenched in sarcasim, no matter how serious the situation was. 

It was on enough that I would catch enough of an episode to watch it through, then before I know it ive seen the series a couple times, but you can see pretty early on in the show that Rory and Lorali are pretty selfish people that are only looking out for themselves."
Angry Mom,No she really isn't.
Angry Mom,You mean she started as a teenager and then became an adult and got even worse. You know that adult is different from teenager right?
Angry Mom,My thoughts exactly
Angry Mom,"It absolutely makes sense. I know of at least two classmates who went to the ivies and were BAMF students and did extra curriculars and stuff. But they both floundered post graduation. My theory for them and Rory is that you put your heart into being good by the standards of school rather than actual life and when the structure of school is removed you’re left goalless. When you’re not striving for grades, what do you strive for? No one can teach you how to live a fulfilling life, we all define that for ourselves. I think this was the point of rory’s character and the message did get buried a bit in the revival because it was a mess."
Angry Mom,"I get that, it is really hard I mean Rory doesn’t even have her go to grad school. I’m kind of surprised they didn’t throw it in that she went back to school to get her masters in journalism. Like didn’t have to be Yale, Columbia School of Journalism is amazing. Would’ve explained a couple years what she was doing. 

Though it explains that the one place she was getting an offer from was that weird online news place. Which I guess we throwing shade at online publications taking over because that place was weird. They were hounding Rory and even had a card board cut out of her and yet were still like yea you don’t have the job. Who makes a cardboard cut out of someone that’s still a prospective employee, and who makes a cardboard cut out of someone at all. Plus their open concept work environment sounds like my nightmare. At least give me a cubical. 

But again Rory handled that so un-Rory like was well! She didn’t have her portfolio with her! Like even if she didn’t really want the gig, Rory is always prepared. There’s no way that even if she didn’t have a hard copy at all times that’s she would have like a USB key chain with her portfolio on her at all times. One of the few times Rory got angry with her grandfather was when he set up the Yale interview and she was totally unprepared. She actually yells at him for that. I know she can be selfish and arrogant at times but she is always prepared."
Angry Mom,Ouch
Angry Mom,"Exactly. And like real people, they are flawed and have traumas from their pasts that still impact their present. I thought it was pretty complex for a show that I initially read as being for teens. I rewatched for the revival and found myself way more interested in the Lorelei Emily storyline this time around. It’s entertainment first and foremost but it’s layered and a pretty solid storytelling effort IMO."
Angry Mom,I think Rory is definitely bad. If she thinks all those marital affairs are right she had weird morals.
Angry Mom,"You have to take her within her own context. Her heart is in the right place, but she often expresses it ""poorly"" because of the difference in upbringing/environment. She's not a perfect person, but she's a great character, because her compassion isn't on the surface, but it is deep."
Angry Mom,"True, but the paladinos weren't involved in the final season before the revival, because they had a falling out with the network or something. And honestly it feels like they were still kind of pissed about not getting to finish the show, so they crapped all over it."
Angry Mom,"Yes, a really really bad musical, that got waaay too much screentime"
Angry Mom,"Alternatively: you can either finish the show, or just take my word for it!"
Angry Mom,You're right - I did! Christopher sucks too!
Angry Mom,[deleted]
Hospital ship,"Honestly, one look at the photoshopped/fake poster of the show told me all I needed to know."
Hospital ship,"I skipped it after seeing the promo images and that they had tagged the show as  emotional, exciting, and romantic. I love sci-fi but that alone told me I'm probably not their target audience."
Hospital ship,"SPOILERS!!

The biggest most idiotic scene I had ever scene on this show was the crew of 2 getting water from outside the spacecraft. They came up with this whole stupid fucking idea of charging their suits with electrostatic electricity to attract water ice freely floating in space towards them and slowly fill their bags with it.

It was downright moronic even if you ignore the stupid physics behind it. Why don't they just put the fucking bag on the hole on the side of the spacecraft and capture all ice directly into the fucking bag? instead we see them wasting precious water and smiling like fucking idiot because it looked 'beautiful'."
Hospital ship,"Edward Zwick has an exec producer credit for this show. I'd love to know how involved he really was. Along with Herskovitz he is partly responsible for My So Called Life and Once and Again which I found to be some of the best TV of those times. He also did The Last Samurai.

I think the biggest problem with Away is it has no direction. It just meanders around vaguely. The story is almost nonexistent and the characters are boring as hell and not very realistic as astronauts. Really only the Russian actor can seem to play a realistic one, but even he seems to have been directed away from that a bit toward weak as fuck melodrama.

I have never seen mission control portrayed as a bunch of retards before. I think that may be a first for this show. They are always portrayed as so intelligent and heroic in supporting their astronauts. In this series it could almost be played for laughs they are so incompetent. Not that the astronauts are much better. Clueless and incompetent all. I also never really got a sense that these people were really in space. What a disaster. I was hoping for My So Called Spaceship, but that is not this."
Hospital ship,I don't really understand why you thought it was promising.  The whole think looked like a lifetime movie to me.
Hospital ship,My wife likes it and is occupied while I play video games. Win.
Hospital ship,My friend I think you'd like Mars. It's a 2016 show that aired on National Geographic for two seasons. It's about the most realistic depiction of early Mars colonisation I've seen on the small screen.
Hospital ship,"I was sort of expecting an extended The Martian series, and what I got was the opposite - solutions that wouldn't work, teams that wouldn't co-operate, and a lack of good humor. 

I gave up about half way through."
Hospital ship,"I have not watched this and do not plan on it but reading rants like this is one of my favourite things to read. got a good chuckle out of your pain OP, thanks"
Hospital ship,I didn’t read past the first spoiler so I wonder if you mentioned that one character is exactly like a character on The Good Doctor.
Hospital ship,"I love space stuff and love a good drama but man I found this boring. 
If you’re after a great space show give For All Mankind a go it’s wonderful"
Hospital ship,"Oh man. The daughter drama was the worst part. I don't fucking care about a girl sneaking out of her house to go to her boyfriend's church. That's right, she went to church!"
Hospital ship,"If the daughter dropped the dirtbike on her foot and cracked a toenail, they would probably have told mother in space, ""your daughter was in a motorcycle accident"".

No need for nuance.

The boyfriend is freaking out in the hospital... He doesn't know what's happening because he's not family.


He was at the fucking track.... What did she do? Sprain her shoulder? He'd know that she wasn't in a life threatening situation. 

He likely helped he up and asked if she's ok... Which she would have replied ""my shoulder fucking hurts like a bitch, better take me to hospital"".

This show is so poorly written. Im almost embarrassed to still be watching it. I think I want to see how much bullshit that can come up with. For research."
Hospital ship,"While I actually agree with a lot of your assessments...

I watched the whole series and still actually enjoyed it. It definitely requires a suspension of disbelief in a few places, but I actually enjoyed most of the characters and their personal struggles. I liked that most of what was going on was internal to the characters rather than the trials of space flight which we've seen a million other times in other shows and movies.

I will say I agree - this is a drama series, not a sci-fi space romp to Mars."
Hospital ship,"This was a great read. Sadly i have to agree also. Sadly yes because space exploration is my favorite subject. Sadly the shows/movies that trying to bult a realistic scenario are not many.

This show also make Nasa look like idiots lol."
Hospital ship,How were they speaking with Earth in real time? Can we do that now? Is this near future tech?
Hospital ship,I got about fifteen seconds into the preview video on Netflix before I realized what kind of show it is.
Hospital ship,I watched it all because I had nothing else to do. It is not good.
Hospital ship,">
 • Why didn't they just give Ram some Ibuprofen or fever reducer? Why was he on his death bed then suddenly considered non contagious the minute his fever broke? Why would they even approve him to go on the mission if he had latent Mono? 

loved the useless facemask/faceshield"
Hospital ship,"TROPE DICTIONARY ..Aahh thank God this thread exists ! or I had to make a new one.. Me and husband were really looking forward to it and then it is so bad, unwatchable.

How many times have we seen the strong independent wife mom misrepresented ? Hello welcome to away.

Everything that can go wrong in spaces goes wrong, because hey ! we need non-spontaneous drama.

The most bothering thing is the cliche representation character - all races, queer, differently abled fine but so badly researched, zero depth, you can easily see through the attempt at diversity when the heroine and her family is white and straight and all side characters carry diversity flags. I am from India and the character 'Ram' is so badly done, zero research has gone behind his 'hindi' dialogues, seriously if anyone who remotely knows hindi hears it they will die of shock, his entire character is a walking caricature.. I hope the intent was good but the end result is almost insultingly hilarious.

WHOEVER IS TRYING TO BE INCLUSIVE PLEASE RESEARCH !!

OP has listed a lot of points so I am not adding. Sigh again. why is money poured into making stuff like this and here goes my usual rant - why Hannibal season 4/5 is not made."
Hospital ship,"I thought the sci fi aspects were pretty grounded in reality. But it seems  they are throwing problems at them constantly while giving flashbacks/drama. 

Could have been better but it's decent for what it is."
Hospital ship,"We need a fan edit to cut out all the family drama at home.

Make it a tight 60 minute space show/movie and call it a day."
Hospital ship,"It's the sort of show where you feel as if it was manufactured to appeal to as many audiences as possible, but ends up appealing to very few.

Space stuff for the guys, emotional stuff for the ladies etc."
Hospital ship,"**This show pretended it was going to be like Gravity, The Martian, Apollo 13, First Man, Sunshine, etc... but it's just a ""This is Us"" type clone in space.**

Episode formula from what I watched is like this:

1. A crew member is a dick to someone or has something terrible happen to them.

2. Show flashback to try and explain either a similar story or justification as to why the character is a dick or why it's extra tragic this is happening to them.

3. Crew member usually starts out not getting along with another crew member or 2, but by the end, the other crew understands their flaw, forgives them, and the crew member usually has overcome being a dick or sad or whatever.

The end.

Next episode? Same thing, different crew member(s), whatever fight they had resolved doesn't matter because there's a new completely isolated new scenario where character X hates character Y b/c they need someone to have them resolve a conflict with.

There are a few cool bits thrown in for space nerds - but it feels like the space stuff almost always either acts simply as a story vehicle for petty bullshit, or sometimes even just completely takes a back-seat to the interpersonal melodrama between the characters."
Hospital ship,"I read this thread and am also thankful to have somewhere to rant.

I have not finished it yet, and was about to give up, but will probably push on.

\*\*\*\*\*I have a Theory\*\*\*\*\*

\- How can the stupid things that happen? - which are so disconnected from reality - just for drama's sake?

\- I mean the emotional and the technical side of the show's GOOFs all have one thing in common - \*not connected to reality\*.  Every one of them FEELS CONTRIVED (oh no here we go again... oops his skin fell off ... oops someone is going blind... oops ... oops ....oops)

\- Example - what are the odds of the stroke happening when it did? What are the odds of the Solar Panel deployment happening just after the non-existent ""point of no return"" (its not distance like an airplane or boat... its when your engines stop firing!!), why is it not redundant?  What are the odds... etc.

So my THEORY is this:

Netflix are experimenting with a AI based plot and script writer,  they give it a set of show parameters and out comes something that looks good to the AI but does not pass the Turing Test with us humans.

Then the dumb Netflix management don't know the difference and they pay to have it made....

Just a THEORY - but it seems to match the observable facts."
Hospital ship,At least Netflix still releases all the episodes
Hospital ship,[removed]
Hospital ship,"Yeah, I don't really get how anyone went into this expecting it to be sci-fi focused."
Hospital ship,"I know what you mean. Sci-Fi can do romance really well. Like Interstellar. But that would never ever be tagged ""romance""."
Hospital ship,"It is not a romance, it is more of a cryfest every fucking episode. Everyone fucking cries in all episodes."
Hospital ship,"It's not emotional or exciting or romantic. And it is unscientific sci-fi with a trope dictionary thrown at it, and diversity done all wrong. Garbage. rant. stop."
Hospital ship,"THIS! I literally laughed out loud. This has to take the award for the stupidest scene in the entire history of ""science fiction"" television. And it has a lot of competition.

Also just before they start their EVA they're STANDING in the airlock which is in the non-rotating part of the ship and where there's no centripetal gravity. You can even see the crew quarters rotating in the background.

And while we're at it how about the communication link? It's instantaneous up to the mid-point of their approach to Mars then instantly switches to the 20 minute delay you would expect. And why suddenly no video just because there's a 20 minute delay? WTF?"
Hospital ship,The ice crystals scene is the worst piece of writing I have ever seen in a production of this scale. Literally no effort at all to come up with even a slightly plausible idea. There was a lot of dumb shit in this show but that might be the dumbest scene in sci-fi.
Hospital ship,"I already thought the writing was horrible, but that scene made me google to read how many other people hated it. So bad.

My reaction to the scene was that it was all a setup for seeing the crystals all around in space.

Edit: Right after typed this, the boyfriend sneaks out the window, presumably unnoticed, and then a few second later we learn reporters are camped out around the house. Not sure how they missed his escape.

The worst part of the horrible writing is that there are so many good actors speaking trash dialogue."
Hospital ship,Sounds like I made the right call to stop watching 6 episodes in.
Hospital ship,Zwick directed the first episode and its pretty common for the pilot director to recieve an exec producer credit.
Hospital ship,"There should be a recommendation thread for shite shows that significant others would like, for this reason alone."
Hospital ship,[deleted]
Hospital ship,">I was sort of expecting an extended The Martian series

I never knew I needed anything like that til now.

I love The Martian - wish it was like 30 mins longer than the extended edition is. But a 10 episode show with a similar vibe to that, that can capture that feeling of isolation and the way science is of paramount importance in space? That would be amazing."
Hospital ship,"Yeah it was obviously inspired by The Martian but the writing was nowhere near the standard it needed to be.   Feel bad for Hilary Swank but the way they had the crew question her ability to lead, had her question her ability to lead and then consistently show that she shouldnt be leading.  Like the whole episode where she was losing it because she skipped her water rations so she could keep a plant alive was just frustrating."
Hospital ship,"I think the concept of focusing on personal relationships and mental stress could have been great. However the fact that they used these contrived, ridiculous scenarios and unrealistic/overblown interpersonal dramas to drive the character development ruined it for me. 

Feelings of isolation, cabin fever, living in close quarters with crewmates, stressful life or death problem solving...all very real issues that could have been better conveyed through better writing.

They could have left us thinking, ""wow, deep space travel is going to be mentally draining for people"". Instead they left me thinking ""wow, they better not choose drama-queen astronauts who hate each other for the first Mars mission""

IMO there was just not enough substance here to fill 10 episodes. I think this would have been better executed as a 90 minute movie. It would have still been boring, but not insufferable."
Hospital ship,"The Expanse. :)

Enough said."
Hospital ship,Mars is pretty good. Did people here not like Mars?
Hospital ship,"Forgot about the communication link shenanigans. What was even dumber was when they thought Pegasus crashed they didn't have a single satellite that could give visual confirmation...and instead used used some crazy scheme to listen to a sonic boom on an obsolete lander via ""UHF"". As if detailed satellite reconnaissance of the landing zones wouldn't have been happening continuously throughout the mission.

But then when planning landing turns out they actually did have HD satellite images of the landing zone....

I was actually straight up scream-laughing at the water ice crystal scene. They didn't even attempt to explain why they couldn't have just brought the bag closer to the valve."
Hospital ship,"I'm case you haven't found it, is on Netflix.

I found this thread by googling ""Away Netflix space bag water"" after the stupid space angel ice halo crap, because I knew people would be laughing about it."
Hospital ship,">Feel bad for Hilary Swank

Why? She's not a particularly good actress."
Hospital ship,They should make a Mass Effect show. That could work.
Hospital ship,"Yea, The Expanse is a great example of realistic scenario space exploration. Fantastic recommendation."
Hospital ship,As long as it's a new story set in the Mass Effect universe and not an adaptation of Shepard's story.
Hospital ship,hmm i can see it work.

Hospital ship,"Dan and Roseanne Connor are the best TV couple of all time.

 I have some friends that remind me of this couple. As annoying as Roseanne is, she's not unbearable like most TV wives. Dan's not portrayed as a moron.. The couple has an unmatched chemistry that isn't normally found on television.

The drama that the two went through felt real. As  loud and annoying as they were, they weren't constantly nagging at each other about petty shit. Neither came off as ungrateful for the other.

Dan doesn't treat Roseanne like she's a moron. Roseanne doesn't demand constant attention from him. Dan's not constantly scheming to pull one over on Roseanne. She's not trying to make him into the man she thinks he can be and lets him be the man that she is.

The only ""flaw"" in their characters is they're not attractive. They're middle aged fatties from the midwest.

The most enduring quality in this couple is the fact that the love the characters have for each other really comes through the TV screen. Unlike Ray and Debora, Penny and Leonard, Ross and Rachel, Doug and Kerri, or any other TV couple you're not left wondering WTF do they see in each other. They're a perfect match for each other."

Hospital ship,"This would be a perfectly fine relationship if Tony would just let her fuck Furio.  He fucks around constantly with sometimes entirely random women but the like two times she has the hots for another dude it’s like the greatest betrayal of all time.

She also needs to shut up about his dangerous career. She didn’t marry a mild mannered chemistry teacher. She doesn’t really get to complain that the monster she chose to marry fully aware he was a monster is a monster."

The Scholar Who Walks the Night,You watched nine seasons of a show you hated? Why?
The Scholar Who Walks the Night,"Being in the same genre =/= being of the same quality. 

The Last of Us is a great show so far, full stop. Wonderfully written/acted/paced/etc. Regardless of genre, it is just an incredibly high quality show. 

Will they fall prey to the same traps TWD did in latter seasons? Who knows? Who cares at this point?"
The Scholar Who Walks the Night,"The best way I can put it is ""focus"".

With most of the later Walking Dead episodes, the focus was a little scattered. You'd get a conversation here, a conversation there, a little action, but it felt a bit all over the place without any cohesion in the narrative or themes. It was a bit like a soap opera. The best episodes were the ones that would focus on something in particular. For example, there was a whole episode devoted to Eastman teaching Morgan how to fight with the bo staff. Those were the most engaging episodes.

That's what The Last of Us is doing right. It's focusing episodes around specific things that build up to something and not just scatter shot something resembling a narrative."
The Scholar Who Walks the Night,">I'm sure some HBO sponsored algorithm will delete this post

You need to go outside and breath in some fresh air."
The Scholar Who Walks the Night,"The problem with the Walking Dead wasn't really the plot itself. The problem was that it was stretched to 16 episodes per season with 8 episodes of plot because the network is greedy and strung it out for money. The problem was that the writing was painful with an acting core which really wasn't that good after they killed the best off in the first couple seasons. The problem was they were began trying to write dialogue and interweaving storylines like game of thrones in later seasons and failed miserably. 

TLOU will tell a complete story in one season. It's in the setting up stage. Still, the acting is much better and, when you know how this story ends, the smaller moments will mean a lot more to you on rewatch. If you don't like the payoff as the end of the season, feel free to have this take. As of now, you have to trust that the ride will be worth it."
The Scholar Who Walks the Night,"Spoiler, Joel doesn't get flown away in a helicopter.

I'm calling it now."
The Scholar Who Walks the Night,"The entire story of TLoU is out, just look it up and decide for yourself?

This is nothing like the Walking Dead. The Last of Us isn't going past 3 seasons."
The Scholar Who Walks the Night,"In The Walking Dead there never seemed to be a real overarching goal other than to survive and find and keep sanctuary. The main group would accomplish this until a new antagonist was introduced and the group had to fight them off or go somewhere else and start over.  


We are only a few episodes into The Last of Us but its already apparent what the goal is: Deliver Ellie to the Fireflies so they can hopefully research her immunity to find a cure. People that played the game will know what happens but at least an end goal is apparent and attainable. At this point its impossible for the show to go 9 seasons. It will not end up like the Walking Dead.  


I do think that there were characters introduced that gave me TWd vibes. Kathleen for example. Hopefully next episode will add some more context."
The Scholar Who Walks the Night,"Episode 4 is not a victim of this because Ellie/Joel character development is the story, and it unfolds beautifully with each episode.

And I won’t be the same because it’s:
a) a great existing story adapted beautifully 
b) showrunner is one of the best working on TV currently 

I wouldn’t worry if I were you"
The Scholar Who Walks the Night,Well for starters HBO has decent writers and directors and they aren't going to make 20 episodes per season where basically nothing happens for 90% of the time. It will be 2 or max 3 seasons and they'll wrap it up.
The Scholar Who Walks the Night,"""hate watched the last nine seasons""

Who has the time to watch a show you don't like? I don't get it, but you do you."
The Scholar Who Walks the Night,"At some point people should probably learn the zombie genre is about character interaction primarily and almost exclusively. 

Apparently 11 years of twd wasn't enough. Maybe a few years of the last of us will be"
The Scholar Who Walks the Night,"I read the Walking Dead comic and played Part 1 of the Last of Us. 

These two shows are similar in their early seasons. Let's be real, we only got 4 episodes of The Last of Us. Most of those episodes had very little zombies. Which is fine, that's the point of these shows, to explore the human condition in a zombie plague. 

I loved the Walking Dead until they started being cowards. They wouldn't kill the big characters, they were afraid of losing viewers. That was the downfall IMO. Darryl needs to take the bat. That would make people watch, why? But everyone loves Darryl? Yeah but you have 3 seasons of Negan being alive and well. The crew could be after him for revenge. Anyways, that's not the point. 

The Last of Us has the same thing going for it, but now the creators have said they would stick to the game...ok we will see. But the few episodes we have seen, yeah this is going to be good if they keep it up. Milk it? 

Tell us the story of Joel in a spin-off. The 20 years that's missing. I'm watching every night."
The Scholar Who Walks the Night,"I agree, comparison with TWD is inevitable. I asked myself the other day, is it really different? I see similar situations plot wise. TWD used to be huge, now The Last of Us is huge."
The Scholar Who Walks the Night,Yes they are very different
The Scholar Who Walks the Night,Yes walking dead was stretched out garbage
The Scholar Who Walks the Night,"The Last of Us has a much bigger budget, and so won’t be forced to keep characters in one place for entire seasons at a time due to not having the money to build multiple big sets.  

Also, they won’t drag this show out longer than they need to.  The first game is the first season.  The second game looks set to be seasons two and three.  By that time, the third game will probably be out and they can go from there.  Unlike most networks, HBO historically has not pressured their creators to extend shows past their creative vision."
The Scholar Who Walks the Night,"Here's why your concerns are unwarranted

(1) The show is only going to run for three seasons. Hence it won't become stale and repetitive.

(2) The main cast is small. Literally two people. That may change in the future but I doubt it will blow up and become bloated like TWD. Joel and Elle should be in every episode and not disappear an come off as guest stars of the their own show."
The Scholar Who Walks the Night,"Conceptually, they aren't that different.  I don't agree with the people making strained arguments for how they're totally different.

They're primarily about genuine character relationships/interactions under the stress and tension of a post-apocalyptic world.

It's the execution that is potentially quite different.

At least in my case, I just grew tired of TWD and stopped really caring.  After a while, it just felt like ""why am I watching this?""  ""What's the point?""  As for how I got there, I would say the show led me to that point with its writing.

At least so far with The Last of Us, I still care.  In shows like TWD and The Last of Us, it's pretty important that you care about the characters.  It's the difference between character driven stories and plot driven stories.  You need good characters to be a character driven story.  What I think The Last of Us has done well so far is establish characters quickly with enough development while making them likable.  It's okay if the episodes are development heavy if you actually care about the characters just as much as their journey / the plot."
The Scholar Who Walks the Night,"TWD and Last of us are very very different stories. That they both have 'zombies' is almost inconsequential. I want to avoid saying more due to spoilers, but I'll say the TWD is a zombie story, even the comics. The Last of Us is not a zombie story, zombies just exist in the story."
The Scholar Who Walks the Night,This post reminds me of the r/overwatch subreddit where they pour hundreds of hours into a game they don’t enjoy and come on Reddit to let people know as if they give a shit lol
The Scholar Who Walks the Night,"
But what do we have in the Last of Us?  Episode 2, they got slightly further. Episode 3, excellent character story but at the end the only development was the acquisition of some more guns (Walking Dead haters would have downvoted the episode into oblivion).  

Just to prove you wrong I hate the walking dead and I loved episode 3.

But genuinely, you seem to have missed the entire point of The Last of Us. 

The show isn’t *about* the apocalypse. It’s about the people in it, and how they find each other and form strong bonds and connections in a world that tries its best to destroy every last ounce of hope. Joel even states multiple times throughout the first four episodes that he doesn’t really fear or care about the “zombies”. It’s the people he fear. Hopeless people who will do anything they can to survive one more day. 

> Episode 4, we got a little further.     

You watched four episodes of the show, where the main plot point is “get Ellie from point A to point B and you complain that they’re….. getting further to point B?

> I'm just curious, me and the rest of the world hated the last 9 seasons of the Walking Dead because of the overabundance of character development and the lack of plot development.  

I hated it because it had little to no character development, relied on self grandiose characters and little to no plot, shocking scenes for the sake of shock and a near mindless attitude towards where the plot was going. 

> Four episodes in and The Last of Us has already become a victim of this.    

You aren’t watching the last of us if you think this. 

> How many episodes until Joel gets flown away in a helicopter and we never hear from him again?     

If you don’t like it, don’t watch it. I genuinely do not understand why you would bother watching a show that’s clearly neither meant for you, nor one that you’re able to “get”. Which is fine, but you don’t need to make a point out of it. Just stop watching."
The Scholar Who Walks the Night,"I think the difference is hope.  What do the characters in Walking Dead hope for? Just another day? 

In Last of Us, there is hope in a cure. And I think that’s what keeps them going in a different kind of way"
The Scholar Who Walks the Night,"I agree 100% about Walking Dead:  It stopped being scifi or even horror and became just an endless survivalist slog.  I have not been interested in \_The Last of Us\_ because I am so turned off by the whole genre now, but I've heard such good things about it that I have been on the fence about trying it..."
The Scholar Who Walks the Night,"I can't hate watch nine episodes, let alone nine seasons. Hot damn"
The Scholar Who Walks the Night,It’s very intricately different… lol
The Scholar Who Walks the Night,"As someone who’s played the games, keep watching."
The Scholar Who Walks the Night,"Yes, unlike The Walking Dead, The Last of US is great."
The Scholar Who Walks the Night,">I'm just curious, me and the rest of the world hated the last 9 seasons of the Walking Dead 

Rest of the world did not hate the last 9 seasons lol

>because of the overabundance of character development and the lack of plot development.  Four episodes in and The Last of Us has already become a victim of this.

I get the feeling you don’t understand the point of these shows. It would be best to stay away from them."
The Scholar Who Walks the Night,TWD was never a good show. Boring characters and absolutely terrible writing.
The Scholar Who Walks the Night,The walking dead in later seasons had a young black woman who somehow kept a perfectly managed fade in the middle of the fucking wilderness and apocalypse. the attention to detail makes a world of difference.
The Scholar Who Walks the Night,"The difference is The Walking Dead is a soap opera, that's what Kirkman set out to create, it's about communitys and the injection of drama into them, TLOU is a character study, it has communities but they aren't the focus, rather the journey of a few characters is.

Now I love TWD comic but it's very true that it got into a routine of find a community, destroy it move to the next, with each arc it becomes a look into these communities how they form and what it takes to tear them down, TLOU is different in that each game is the arc, there's a journey across the country but its not about establishing and destroying communities, it's about fostering a bond and then raising a question, exactly how much does that bond mean?

I think the set dressing is going to feel similar, because it's post apocalyptic zombie adjacent, if you spend all your time trying to create something unique in that space that makes sense there won't be time to focus on the elements that make it good, so yes there's different communities around the world but how the narrative interacts with is different because its not the soap opera that TWD set out to be."
The Scholar Who Walks the Night,"What a shit title and take.

>Vince Gilligan could've solved these issues in two episodes.

As a Breaking Bad fan, I cringed when you mentioned Vince.

>me and the rest of the world hated the last 9 seasons of the Walking Dead because of the overabundance of character development and the lack of plot development.

And you think it got 9 seasons beyond your taste because people hated it? I loved TWD, though I hate almost everything post-Rick, and he was there until Season 9. I did not hate the character development at all... I still don't understand why you feel so entitled to claim the world shares your opinion? It seems to me you're just a Left 4 Dead fan who wanted a Left 4 Dead show...

>Episode 3, excellent character story but at the end the only development was the acquisition of some more guns

Tell me this is satire...

>How many episodes until Joel gets flown away in a helicopter and we never hear from him again?

This is satire, isn't it? This happens in the next episode. Ellie then goes around girl bossing people left and right until she meets a Brother in Christ that straightens her up. /s"
The Scholar Who Walks the Night,TWD has more interesting characters.
The Scholar Who Walks the Night,"Can’t say I understand hate watching at all, but personally I don’t like the walking dead and am loving the last of us."
The Scholar Who Walks the Night,"You are not wrong. The Last of Us is a good show, as TWD has been for several seasons. And there's nothing extraordinary about TLoU, other than an efficient marketing machine. Again, it's a good show, nothing new or surprising. It's not a demerit, actually. Perhaps this sub has been watching little TV for the last 2 years and being surprised by anything."
The Scholar Who Walks the Night,"Um, zombies currently aren’t the focus? Walking Dead had just an endless supply and they were all over just about every episode."
The Scholar Who Walks the Night,Feels exactly the same. Will stop after the first season like walking dead.
The Scholar Who Walks the Night,I love comics (Invincible and Saga are 2 of my favs) but the last of us game is so much more popular are reached so many more people.  Had HBO picked up TWD and cut all the fat that AMC/Gimple bloated TWD with I believe it would have been a completely different show.  It’s almost as if two great stories can vary wildly in quality when brought to screen by different producers.
The Scholar Who Walks the Night,"I've hardly seen any zombies/mushroom people. So yes, it's different."
The Scholar Who Walks the Night,yeah
The Scholar Who Walks the Night,"Why did you ""hate watch"" *nine seasons* of a TV show? I don't think you hate it at that point."
The Scholar Who Walks the Night,"The Walking Dead would have benefited from a 8-10 episode person season format. Regardless of what people say, imo, was good up until the end of season 6 when they ended it with Negan killing someone and us not knowing. The Whisperers made it interesting again too. So they could've cut a lot of filler episodes and the show would still be considered one of the better shows of the last decade. Also, HBO just cranks out great content. The Walking Dead almost was going to be on HBO too. But we may not have gotten GoT."
The Scholar Who Walks the Night,It’s similar to well-written episodes of TWD from the early seasons before it became silly and even more over the top
The Scholar Who Walks the Night,"Gave up on Walking Dead at around season 6/7. 

My wife pushed on through to the end and now wants me to start on TLoU, and I gotta say I am just not interested in the LEAST.

I didn't play the game either, even though I'm a video game guy. I am just sick to death of the genre."
The Scholar Who Walks the Night,"I’ve just been reflecting on this. If walking dead was about the main and his son just traveling around, there would be no difference at all. Actually one of the major failings of TWD was the large ensemble to track. Structurally and content wise they’re the same"
The Scholar Who Walks the Night,I watched season 1 of WD and thought it was boring and uninteresting. None of the characters were developed. And the zombies were generic. The characters make or break story for me and I never connected with them. Last of Us is the characters. They are the most important aspects to the story.
The Scholar Who Walks the Night,"The game is, the tv show? Not so much. More gayness, but otherwise yeah it’s a case of wash rinse repeat."
The Scholar Who Walks the Night,TLOU has 3 seasons worth of story. So it wont overstay his welcome like TWD.
The Scholar Who Walks the Night,"Well there’s only two games, without getting into spoilers - both have very definitive endings and make big, bold narrative choices. Mazin has said Season 1 is Game 1 and Season 2 will adapt Game 2. He also has said that he hates filler, and based on the first four episodes that seems to be true. I guess what I’m saying is this show is going to make big points and do them faster than most shows. I’d be surprised if the show goes longer than 3 seasons. At the most, it’ll be 5 if they end up releasing a Last of Us: Part III"
The Scholar Who Walks the Night,"I wound up watching TWD to find out (1) what caused the zombies; and (2) whether it could be cured.  Late on, this turned into watching begrudgingly, when I realized it was never going to happen. 

I got that from the 1st episode in TLOU."
The Scholar Who Walks the Night,"Because we know exactly where it’s going. The pacing feels right when you have a general sense of how much is supposed to happen, which is something TWD could’ve never had with its audience. 

There’s a huge amount of people who are watching this knowing what to expect - and wanting them to slow down to take time to maybe expand a bit more.

I can also understand the audience who haven’t played the games getting frustrated at the slower pacing, but I hope you get to see how this really builds out the world and develops the characters more than we’d typically see in this genre. Ultimately what made the game so successful in 2013 was it succeeded *despite* the genre. In a time where we had new “zombie” content everywhere the characters and storytelling really set this apart to win over people who otherwise wouldn’t have given it a second look.

Coming from a very recent game also gives the producers a huge advantage. We already know the plot, setting, characters, concept art, how things should look, how the characters should sound and behave. Hell, we even have most of the staging blocked out like it was already a movie. While it could be seen as limiting, to me this has given them so much relief to essentially turn in a “newer draft” of the script they’d already written. We get things expanded that needed clarification, adapted to slow or speed up the pace where necessary, etc. I think that’s just such a unique position to be in because other adapted works are working with much, much less material and have to spend so much more time creating the world."
The Scholar Who Walks the Night,1 episode showing a high-quality character arc beats mediocre character arcs milked to death for 20 episodes a season.
The Scholar Who Walks the Night,Episode 4 showed a lot. TLOU isn't about zombies. It's about Joel and Ellie. You are looking at the show wrong.
The Scholar Who Walks the Night,"Patience, young padawan"
The Scholar Who Walks the Night,"No one will have a conversation about the last of us 2 plot. I’ve tried. People either hate it, or love it to death. I do not like the story. If you’ve seen walking dead seasons 6-8. The last of us season 2 will be very familiar lol"
The Scholar Who Walks the Night,"They are very similar, and even the conceit of the plot of TLOU is not very original: ""Get immune person to someone who can science a cure,"" but I think the devil is in the details, it's crafted with extreme care and very high quality."
The Scholar Who Walks the Night,"Honestly, yes. They are different shows, and that’ll become more clear as it goes along."
The Scholar Who Walks the Night,"The rabid fans won't admit it, but this show will fall into the TWD pattern as episodes go on. The stories aren't carbon copy, but TWD had a great start as well. 

The fans will tell you TLoU isn't about the walkers or clickers, but what was TWD after a couple of seasons. TWD was about human condition and savagery. Guess what will happen in TLoU."
The Scholar Who Walks the Night,To build himself up to hate another show and tell us all about it
The Scholar Who Walks the Night,"The show did a pretty good job at having 1-2 good episodes per season that would keep you coming back with a small amount of hope they might turn it around.  Usually the season premiere and finale were worthy, rest was trash."
The Scholar Who Walks the Night,"Yeah, that shit always puzzles me.

I also got to the point where I wasn't enjoying the walking dead anymore, but I watched like 3 or 4 episodes pass that point. I sure as hell didn't keep watching the entire thing. Why when there is so much else I can be doing?"
The Scholar Who Walks the Night,This man is fueled on pure spite.
The Scholar Who Walks the Night,"I wonder if they really did hate-watch it, or they want hide the fact that they watched it so as to not go against consensus."
The Scholar Who Walks the Night,Especially considering seasons 1-6 and 9-11 of Walking Dead are considered good to phenomenal tv. Maybe a sign one doesn’t like the genre if they hate watched the strong seasons
The Scholar Who Walks the Night,"Honestly, I liked the first few seasons enough that I thought it might get back on track at some point. By maybe season 8 it was more of 'well, I've come this far...' There were a few good episodes mixed in and the acting was always solid but they needed to take more chances in the writing room.  I had hope.  It didn't pay off."
The Scholar Who Walks the Night,"They won't, the story for the second game (what will be season 2/3 ) is very different from the first game.

It'll stay fresh because there will be things that take the focus away from just Joel and Ellie in season 2/3."
The Scholar Who Walks the Night,"In all fairness, TWD lost the creator in the middle of the second season and he took a couple key actors with him. 

I doubt that’ll happen here and I still don’t understand why TWD gained popularity after the obvious loss in quality."
The Scholar Who Walks the Night,"To continue with your point, the episode where Eastman teaches Morgan was great, but it was received horribly when it was released. Not because it was a bad episode, but because they put it right after a needless cliffhanger death fake-out, so it killed any pacing that the season had."
The Scholar Who Walks the Night,But take off your aluminum helmet first...
The Scholar Who Walks the Night,"In fairness to OP, many of the old default subs are overrun with bots, marketing, and astroturfing accounts, plus they are good spots to do bot testing since the high volume of users, posts, and such, and are lightly moderated. A bunch of old bot makers used to use all the entertainment based subs to juice their bots and configure them and such.

Not saying OP is right here, and I do not think OP is right, but I get the sentiment. HBO however, hasn't ever really seemed to need to juice here, unlike Apple TV+, who may be the worst offender."
The Scholar Who Walks the Night,That comment is hilarious.
The Scholar Who Walks the Night,You don't think corps game the algorithm? Lol
The Scholar Who Walks the Night,"Trying to explain to OP that zombies are not the plot, just a feature in a post-apocalyptic setting: GIVE ME GOD OF REDDIT difficulty."
The Scholar Who Walks the Night,"> Well for starters HBO has decent writers and directors

I mean, TWD certainly had that for a long time as well.

I mean, the first two episodes were directed by Frank Darabont and Michelle MacLaren (who directed a bunch of Breaking Bad and Game of Thrones along with Westworld, Better Call Saul, and The Leftovers). S1 also had Ernest Dickerson, who directed a bunch of The Wire and Treme."
The Scholar Who Walks the Night,"Yeah. I don’t get how we’re this far in to the zombie genre and people still think the zombies are important. They aren’t. They’re a plot device to make people interact in a new way. No one cares about the zombies, we care about what people do in that situation"
The Scholar Who Walks the Night,"Respect the take. Also respect the flair. I'm 40 and grew up with Beavis and Butthead.  Was sad to find Do The Universe is on the one streaming platform I don't have.     
On a related note, told my co-worker today that I was going to buy the Last of Us and start playing it tonight.  I have an Xbox One and a Switch.  Didn't know it was Playstation exclusive.  Between that and the hundred hate messages I received because of this post, not a great online day overall."
The Scholar Who Walks the Night,"> At least so far with The Last of Us, I still care

You stopped caring for TWD in less than 4 episodes?"
The Scholar Who Walks the Night,Nah TWD is definitely supposed to be about the characters more than the zombies. The writing is just horrible on that show
The Scholar Who Walks the Night,"TWD is not a ""zombie story"", especially in the comics.

""The Walking Dead"" are the people, not the zombies.

https://imgur.com/lu9XPNm"
The Scholar Who Walks the Night,There is absolutely no logical way you could claim that about one show and not the other lol.
The Scholar Who Walks the Night,The trick is when people say this... they didn't actually dislike the 9 seasons haha
The Scholar Who Walks the Night,"This is super revisionist. TWD has bad seasons but trying to argue it was never good is simply laughable. 

The hate circlejerk has gone way farther here than expected. Its kind of asinine"
The Scholar Who Walks the Night,"You don't think The Walking Dead could've benefited from having Vince Gilligan in the writer's room?      
I always thought it somewhat hypocritical when people hated on the ""character development"" episodes for being slow despite the fact that most people originally liked it because it seemed like a realistic take on a zombie apocalypse.     
Life isn't always fast paced.  It's often boring and banal (not that I always want to watch it) but it helps add a bit of realism.  But I see Vince Gilligan as a master of conflict and conflict resolution (the Tuco problem eg.).  Had TWD taken lessons from him they could've stopped retreading old storylines and done something unique.  Jeffrey Dean Morgan is a solid actor but he certainly outstayed his welcome on the show.     
Your vitriol is potent, but as a fellow Breaking Bad fan, I cannot disrespect your opinion."
The Scholar Who Walks the Night,Last of Us 2 at least makes sense in terms of what happened in Last of Us 1. Don’t know if you can say the same about helicopter…
The Scholar Who Walks the Night,Well that's the reason for Reddit right?
The Scholar Who Walks the Night,"I also felt like they knew really well how to end episodes, lots of the episodes would end in a really compelling way that would make me forget how trash the first 40 minutes always were."
The Scholar Who Walks the Night,"What is this? Revisionism?

Season 2, with all the filler episodes at the farmhouse, showed how absolutely terrible the show was capable of being. And it previewed the rot lying ahead of us. They repeated the same terrible formula in season 3.

Half of season 4 showed how it was capable of being good after all, and then things just went from worse to worse.

Good to phenomenal? I don't believe so."
The Scholar Who Walks the Night,"Bots and astroturfing definitely can be a problem, but a negative post about a successful show isn't worth anybody's time.

Not even the time of an intern who works for HBO Max.

Trying to boost the popularity of a show is one thing, but nobody cares a single person comparing a successful show with another successful show."
The Scholar Who Walks the Night,Apple doesn't hold a candle to Disney's astroturfing. The Andor spam was fucking relentless for a couple of months
The Scholar Who Walks the Night,*laughs in Amazon Prime*
The Scholar Who Walks the Night,Exactly. Zombies are the backdrop.   But that’s not what makes The Last of Us work.
The Scholar Who Walks the Night,"Sure, the first season was good. That was like, what, 6 episodes? If you only watch that and ignore the other garbage seasons then sure, it was a good show."
The Scholar Who Walks the Night,"Hate messages are completely unnecessary but you definitely tried to throw something great into a box because you are unfamiliar with it. I'm not sure if I'd recommend playing the game since you haven't already because you will definitely know how the show will end. You will also appreciate every episode it takes to get there a lot more though. Completely your call but having played the game and knowing how it ends, this show is master class and I'm glad they aren't letting us binge it but damn I want to binge it just like I did the game when it came out. Bought it Friday night of release and had it beat by Saturday afternoon."
The Scholar Who Walks the Night,"I saw someone say the last of us show already had a far better legacy than twd... lol

People here really drink the koolaid sometimes when it comes to circlejerk hate"
The Scholar Who Walks the Night,"That's not what I implied.  Given the length of TWD, it would be a stretch to assume ""after a while"" would be in less than 4 episodes."
The Scholar Who Walks the Night,"Not really, even the comic its really zombie-centric most of the time. Its much more of a zombie survival scenario, then about the characters."
The Scholar Who Walks the Night,"Playing the game will spell out that this isn't just a Zombie show. It's about the relationship between it's characters, primarily Joel and Ellie. It's about them and their journey to help one another etc. TWD is just a gore-fest."
The Scholar Who Walks the Night,"I'm guessing you don't know TLOU story? Or TWD story. They are very very different.

Its like saying Star Wars and Star Trek are the same because they are both in space with laser guns"
The Scholar Who Walks the Night,"I may have misread your personality based on your post: you do seem like a reasonable person.

No, I don't think Vince Giligan would've made it any better. The Walking Dead (show) doesn't work around ""realism"" as such. It works around the Post-Apocalypse.

There are many stages for an ""after humanity"" story.

Apocalypse: Resident Evil, Left 4 Dead, Fear The Walking Dead (First season). It's all going downhill and people are running, trying to find a way to go back to normal, to stop it or to ""survive the night"".

Post-Apocalypse: The Walking Dead (S2-S6), Fallout (except for New Vegas). The world as we know it ended. Period. No going back (though they do try to in Season 1), only moving forward. This type of apocalypse is where people are trying to survive daily, trying to find a way to live that doesn't involve a nomadic life style.

Post-Post-Apocalypse: The Walking Dead (S7-S11), Fallout New Vegas. Time to rebuild societies. Humanity can survive daily without worrying too much about food, water, etc. The world isn't back on its feet, but it's back on baby steps.

&#x200B;

Now, the point is: The Walking Dead (show) wasn't necessarily ABOUT the post-apocalypse, but about how humanity, how society, would work IN it. You can see Shane losing his mind over the leadership, with Rick-Lori drama in between, as a ""character drama"", but it's actually something greater than that. It's about the rules, it's about what's right and what's wrong, it's about how society doesn't function the same way it did before (where killing was straght-up bad) yet you still need it to keep the sanity of the people.

Rick tries his best to stick to the old ways, and that's why so many people do him wrong. So many people choosing the ""easy way"" because, like Negan said in ""Here's Negan"", now 'Seeing Red' isn't a matter of what's wrong and what's right. It's a matter of what you can do.

The show constantly throws lots of drama that could relate to characters being characters, but it's meant as Food for Thought. In a similar vein to Walter in S1, handling the situation with Krazy-8. ""What choice is there? How could I handle this?""

&#x200B;

Vince Giligan has a way of building up the conflict and such, but I don't believe he could handle a fantasy show where the conflict isn't in the characters but in the group.

I do love Breaking Bad way more than The Walking Dead, but, same as BrBa, I suggest you watch TWD not as a ""zombie show"" but as a ""re-construction and deconstruction of society"" show, where the main issue is not ""to kill or not to kill"", but ""where do we draw the line of what's right and wrong?"". (Everything after Rick went was kinda trash for me, though. I didn't like it)."
The Emperor Owner of the Mask,"The first incident took place during the sports segment of independent TV station WGN-TV's 9:00 p.m. newscast: https://youtube.com/watch?v=dKnwhokvgxE

The second incident occurred about two hours later during PBS member station WTTW's broadcast of Doctor Who, on the first episode of the serial ""Horror of Fang Rock""."
The Emperor Owner of the Mask,That must have been really freaky.
The Emperor Owner of the Mask,"[This AMA from 11 years ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/eeb6e/i_believe_i_know_who_was_behind_the_max_headroom/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf ) has a lot of really good background information on the incident and a now-disproven theory about who did it, worth the read"
The Emperor Owner of the Mask,"This remains the white whale of awesome TV conspiracies and such

I wish we knew more, but its probably yielded all the info it ever will already, which got us no where. So interesting.

I still believe the most likely case was that it was from the local hacking/phreaking community who worked with someone on the inside or someone who had detailed technical knowledge and means (probably from working TV ops) to somehow disrupt the signal and replace with theirs (in some way, be it a transmitter or something less technically  complicated)"
The Emperor Owner of the Mask,"This is honestly the best kind of unsolved mystery, something legitimately weird and silly and a little bit creepy in which nobody got hurt and anybody who knows anything - and, surely, there must be *somebody* out there who does - also knows well enough to keep their trap shut. (The statute of limitations for any legal repercussions elapsed back in 1992, so there's really no reason for anyone with any knowledge not to come forward save for the fact that it's just more interesting if they don't.)

It's also a real and valuable glimpse into a now-long-gone era when television, as a medium, actually felt as though it could potentially be *dangerous*, that it could be (and, here, was) harnessed for culturally subversive means. Cable TV piracy was a real thing (as was the truly bizarre Wild West of public access television, where any nutbar with a soapbox could and would put themselves out there for the world to see), and - as David Cronenberg has remarked, when discussing the inspirations for Videodrome - there seemed a real possibility that an unwary viewer might stumble across something forbidden, something they weren't really meant to see. TV signals are protected now in ways that render this all but impossible, but this incident is such an encapsulation of that scary and kind of thrilling idea."
The Emperor Owner of the Mask,I live in chicago and it is 1am. I'm not watching that and this is my sign to go to bed.
The Emperor Owner of the Mask,"I remember this happening in detail.
It was upsetting and freaky..."
The Emperor Owner of the Mask,This thumbnail lives in my nightmares.
The Emperor Owner of the Mask,So that was unsettling to say the least
The Emperor Owner of the Mask,"I remember reading somewhere that the local station office has a small satellite dish on top of the building that beams their video a rather short distance to the tower that has a receiving dish, and the tower beams out the transmission to its local viewing area.

So the ""hackers"" were just able to set up another dish nearby to just beam their signal  to the tower and play their video.

So they didn't need to access the inside of the tv station, at all."
The Emperor Owner of the Mask,I saw the WGN one and heard about the WTTW one later.
The Emperor Owner of the Mask,The video thumbnail alone is giving me nightmares. Thanks for reminding me about this creepy incident.
The Emperor Owner of the Mask," A giant masterpiece for all the Greatest World Newspaper nerds, cause I still see the X."
The Emperor Owner of the Mask,Did he call everyone watching nerds at the beginning?
The Emperor Owner of the Mask,Ill save this for the morning…
The Emperor Owner of the Mask,I have a theory that Dave Filoni based Chopper's robot 'voice' after this super distorted craziness.  https://youtu.be/NiTmxpb-7xw?t=366
The Emperor Owner of the Mask,My neighbor in Chicago was taping Dr. Who that Sunday night. He brought the tape over the next day and he was a little disturbed.  He played it and I thought it was really scary.  It was the audio portion that got me.
The Emperor Owner of the Mask,"I'm surprised at how tame their broadcast was, although I can imagine the fact that it was so tame just adding to the uneasiness at the time. I couldn't imagine what it would be like if that happened today."
The Emperor Owner of the Mask,"I don't know why everyone'ss so scared of this, I think it's hilarious."
The Emperor Owner of the Mask,So if was 59 years since JFK's assassination and 35 years since this abomination
The Emperor Owner of the Mask,They should do it again but as a Rickroll on the next Super Bowl.
The Emperor Owner of the Mask,"Honest question...

Are broadcast signals easier or more difficult to hijack now? Why doesn't this happen more often?"
The Emperor Owner of the Mask,"Could you imagine being on psychedelics watching Tv (or just having it on in the background) while this happened??

I would have a hard time choosing if I’d want to run to a hospital or a church or a military base…but I’d be running somewhere and fast!"
The Emperor Owner of the Mask,"I hope that the people behind this reveal how it was accomplished before they pass away, but I suspect it will remain a mystery forever."
The Emperor Owner of the Mask,"This is one of the most disturbing videos I've ever seen, and I've seen actual murder recorded by the murderers (3 guys one hammer got shown to me in elementary school). Not sure what it is about this but it legitimately scares the shit out of me."
The Emperor Owner of the Mask,What show was on? Seems like a The Lighthouse meets Cheers feat Sherlock Holmes?
The Emperor Owner of the Mask,"It was only some side ass shown but I wonder if the person had basically hacked explicit porn, if the TV station would be at all culpable for a fine? 

Also why was it not explicit porn? You’d think if someone was able to do this they’d go all out."
The Emperor Owner of the Mask,Doing this with nothing interesting or important to say deserves very harsh penalty. What a waste.
The Emperor Owner of the Mask,The Malicious Life podcast did a good episode on this: https://www.cybereason.com/blog/malicious-life-podcast-the-max-headroom-signal-hijack
The Emperor Owner of the Mask,This is really freaky.
The Emperor Owner of the Mask,"I was a teenager then living in Chicago. We used to record Doctor Who most of the time because it was on too late to stay up and watch on a Sunday night... because we had school in the morning. For some reason we forgot to set the VCR to record that night.

When the news came out that this happened on WTTW during Doctor Who, we were SO MAD that we didn't have the VCR recording of it.

I'm still kind of mad at myself for this.

Always thought it was so weird that people went through all the trouble and possible jail time to do this (the FCC takes this kind of thing VERY seriously), then have basically nothing interesting to broadcast. Sure, it's weird and freaky. But you'd think they'd have had something more interesting to broadcast than a bunch of garbled nonsense in a Max Headroom costume."
The Emperor Owner of the Mask,Was this before WGN became a cable TV channel?
The Emperor Owner of the Mask,"""Horror of Fang Rock"" is actually a very good story. Also, *Doctor Who* is 59 today."
The Emperor Owner of the Mask,It was ;)
The Emperor Owner of the Mask,It seemed really cringy to me.
The Emperor Owner of the Mask,I really miss how small yet wide reaching  Reddit was ages ago.
The Emperor Owner of the Mask,"I think you are right. This type of thing would have been the challenge that phreakers would be into. The content of the broadcast doesn’t really mean anything, I think they just wanted to see if they could do it."
The Emperor Owner of the Mask,">  a now-long-gone era when television, as a medium, actually felt as though it could potentially be dangerous, that it could be (and, here, was) harnessed for culturally subversive means. 

lol I know you didn't mean it this way, but we're still in that era, and television is definitely [dangerous to our democracy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rknON89H35o)"
The Emperor Owner of the Mask,Nightmare fuel
The Emperor Owner of the Mask,This is maybe #500 on the list of things to be afraid of in Chicago at 1AM
The Emperor Owner of the Mask,*In the city of Chicago/ as the evening shadows fall/ there are people dreaming/ of the hills of Donegal* Always pops into my head when I hear the word ‘Chicago’. But the man from Kildare with a very sweaty head does it better than I ever could https://youtu.be/VZmfMc7lzQo
The Emperor Owner of the Mask,"It's 4am. I _was_ asleep but woke up. 

Maybe the universe wants me to watch this video."
The Emperor Owner of the Mask,"This is just how TV transmission works. No one is really sure how they actually did this. 

Whatever it was, it almost certainly required a lot of technical expertise, so at least one member of this probably was familiar with the setups of local TV stations transmission, probably from working there (although doesn't HAVE to be that, its a good chance), had access to good equipment and more.  -- assuming this is how they did it, which we still don't know, it certainly could have been a far less technically sophisticated situation."
The Emperor Owner of the Mask,The first time I saw this on YouTube I thought he said “I stole CBS”.
The Emperor Owner of the Mask,Everything is digital now. So it’s much harder to tap into a broadcast signal.
The Emperor Owner of the Mask,Doctor Who. Particularly [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horror_of_Fang_Rock) episode.
The Emperor Owner of the Mask,"The question isn't ***what*** show was on, but ***when*** show was on."
The Emperor Owner of the Mask,The program is Dr. Who.
The Emperor Owner of the Mask,"It appeared during the news, and then again a few hours later during an episode of Doctor Who"
The Emperor Owner of the Mask,">But you'd think they'd have had something more interesting to broadcast than a bunch of garbled nonsense in a Max Headroom costume.

Seems likely they were just trying to see/prove that they could do it."
The Emperor Owner of the Mask,"No. I personally remember seeing WGN on cable in the '80s, but according to wiki, their first cable service to carry them was in 1978."
The Emperor Owner of the Mask,"WGN had essentially two feeds. One local for Chicago and one for nationwide. The nationwide feed would carry many of the same programs as the Chicago feed, but sometimes the feed would be different. This is because some of WGNs rerun rights were only for the Chicago market. 

It was a similar situation for WTBS in Atlanta"
The Emperor Owner of the Mask,"Ah, yes.  That interminable war between the Sontarans and the Rutans…"
The Emperor Owner of the Mask,Giggity
The Emperor Owner of the Mask,"The sheer technical prowess to pull it off, with the very real threat of jail time, makes this legend.  

I realize this is like someone projecting “made you look!” On the moon; amazing achievement undercut by a puerile joke."
The Emperor Owner of the Mask,I had just gotten into Reddit around that time. People missed the vibe from before reddit was popular at all back then.
The Emperor Owner of the Mask,Agreed. It was just the can we actually do it aspect.  Very much in line with a lot of hacking phreaking communities of the era
The Emperor Owner of the Mask,It was ;)
The Emperor Owner of the Mask,Bribe tech ops to slip a tape in the machine would be easiest.
The Emperor Owner of the Mask,They googled it from the future.
The Emperor Owner of the Mask,Tom Baker was the best Doctor.
The Emperor Owner of the Mask,True. Then it become DIGG+4chan+tumblr outcasts
The Emperor Owner of the Mask,I can't believe I've been on reddit for 12 years (deleted my first account). But tbh it had the same vibe back then. Unless you mean way before that. There were a lot more cringe meme subs that were popular though.
The Emperor Owner of the Mask,20 minutes into the future
The Emperor Owner of the Mask,"Next Sunday, A.D."
The Emperor Owner of the Mask,"You can say it's extremely outdated and cheesy because well, it is,

but something about those disembodied heads floating around in the background as Carly Beth tries to unlock the door fast enough always gets me to this day."
The Emperor Owner of the Mask,"Love goosebumps the best memories reading them and watching the show, I still throw them on in the background now for noise while tinkering.
 
I didn't realize this as a kid but there's a ton of times that the actors' Canadian accents drop because the show was filmed in Canada. Also Ryan gosling was in the say cheese and die episode"
The Emperor Owner of the Mask,"They used to play this every year around Halloween at school, and it scared the shit out of me. The idea of a mask stuck on your face and increasingly bonding itself to your skin is scary even now"
The Emperor Owner of the Mask,This and werewolf of fever swap. Watched those vhs on a loop.
The Emperor Owner of the Mask,"Nothing will ever be as ICONIC as...

Carly Beth's duck walk."
The Emperor Owner of the Mask,Disney is making a new series. I have low hopes of it being as good as the original. Especially with the details given.
The Emperor Owner of the Mask,This is the exact one that has always stuck with me. Just absolutely terrifying as a kid.
The Emperor Owner of the Mask,ERMAGHERD GERSBERMS!
The Emperor Owner of the Mask,"I host a weekly podcast about growing up in the 90s, and we had a TON of fun talking about goosebumps, and this episode in particular:

https://generations.buzzsprout.com/2024899/11432565-goosebumps"
The Emperor Owner of the Mask,"During the intro as a kid I would close my eyes and plug my ears when the dogs eyes would turn yellow and woof to the tune of the song.  

The show was no problem for me but that part of the intro fucked me all the way up"
The Emperor Owner of the Mask,"I’m so glad you said that lol, I feel the same way. They scared the shit out of me as a kid, and they scare the shit out of me as a grown man."
The Emperor Owner of the Mask,Werewolf of fever swamp was terrifying
The Emperor Owner of the Mask,"Loved Goosebumps as a kid the books and the show, none of them really scared me but that episode had me scared for months lol"
The Emperor Owner of the Mask,As a kid I noticed that they freeze framed the dog during that shot. You can see someone in the background walking who just freezes in place.
The Emperor Owner of the Mask,"When I was a kid I would rent the vhs taped from blockbuster, they'd have 2 episodes on one VHS but the credits would still after the first but before the 2nd episode started.

It would scare me hearing the music come on and seeing the green ooze slide down the screen because my older siblings told me if you wait till the ooze reaches the bottom of the screen, slappy jump scares you so I always closed my eyes at the end credits.


Also I thought the model on the billboard that morphs was Michael Jackson for some reason"
The Emperor Owner of the Mask,"I have a picture of the dog’s head photoshopped on a rapper’s body of him recording his verse in the studio.

The Emperor Owner of the Mask,I love weird childhood memories.
The Emperor Owner of the Mask,"I don’t really care either way, but it’s really bizarre that Joel and Ellie come across, I think, 0 infected after KC."
The Emperor Owner of the Mask,They didn't need tons of infected just a spattering like when Ellie meets David. I feel like that whole interaction would have been better if there was some infected so it's more of a trusting moment for her like in the game
The Emperor Owner of the Mask,[removed]
The Emperor Owner of the Mask,[removed]
The Emperor Owner of the Mask," I missed Ellie fighting infected with David. It made more sense in the game that he wanted to “partner” with her after seeing how useful she was. In the show it felt like we skipped a beat and his fascination with her felt less earned.

The other action sequence I missed was the fight/escape at the university. It didn’t need to be as big as in the game and Joel could still get stabbed by a bat but I missed the suspense of Joel hobbling out as Ellie has to be the protector for the first time. Felt rushed in the show."
The Emperor Owner of the Mask,They got it backwards. Infected are way more critical to the first story than the second.
The Emperor Owner of the Mask,"I get where they are coming from but I think they overcorrected to the point where you're questioning why a vaccine is needed.

The series is probably 1-2 episodes light."
The Emperor Owner of the Mask,The real issue is it only being 9 episodes. 2 of those episodes were back stories and the rest had to also build up other characters.
The Emperor Owner of the Mask,"I do think there should have been more. The story is of course about the characters, and their relationships... But the infected felt completely shunted to the side in the second half of the story. Joel and Ellie run into, what, 1 after Sam? There are opportunities to make them more influential. You don't have to cut every single action sequence."
The Emperor Owner of the Mask,"It's so weird that people see this argument as binary.

Either ""the story isn't about the infected! it's about J and E and their relationship! more would ruin it!"" or ""there was no infected at all! total lack of action! so boring!""

There's a fucking middle ground, people. They could totally have added *some* more infected without killing the story, without making people bored of the violence. No one is asking for 30 minutes of non-stop infected killing every episode. No one wants TWD again. But yes, a *little* more of infected would have been great, and I look forward to a *little* more of them in season 2."
The Emperor Owner of the Mask,"I definitely think 9 episodes was way too short, and am surprised that they didn’t at least go to say, 12 episodes, to flesh out some of the conflicts and characters. But, maybe that’s all that was greenlit and now they are going to get way more leeway to stretch things out and give some storylines some air. Here’s hoping at least."
The Emperor Owner of the Mask,It did feel like they stripped a little too much from the game
The Emperor Owner of the Mask,Rat King is coming
The Emperor Owner of the Mask,"There were two weird uses of the Infected. 1) that the world wide cordyceps web never came back beyond the episode it was referenced in feels like a miss, and 2) the Tress death kiss is still super weird

Other than that, I don’t think it was over or under done. There was a whole scene where the earth opened and a Belcher showed up"
The Emperor Owner of the Mask,Translation: “The Last of Us” will have a shitload more money in the budget for effects.
The Emperor Owner of the Mask,Balance fixes for next patch. Nice!
The Emperor Owner of the Mask,Epic series. They need to turn it into a video game.
The Emperor Owner of the Mask,"It was a serious flaw for me. The story starts on top of a serious,cataclysmic threat and sticks to it for 2 episodes. We see infected again once after that. It's a great story but they travel around freely never having to deal with infected again. Ellie's importance fades. I watched the middle episodes thinking ""oh shit!! they're going to have to enter the buildings"" but no infected anywhere. They have to use the tunnels, no infected, they travel through forests, no infected. They travel to a university then to an empty town and enter a home with no infected anywhere again. The last batch of episodes I basically told myself the infected aren't a danger I guess. I dont see it as a necessity to have the story we got. It's still top tier TV but the show kinda shifts into a generic post apocalypse rather than the world it started off as. Games need high numbers of encounters to keep engagement but this goes hard the opposite direction."

The King 2 Hearts,King Of The Hill and Futurama both coming back. I like it
The King 2 Hearts,This is great news.
The King 2 Hearts,Rip Luanne and Lucky 😞
The King 2 Hearts,Wow. The Mike Judge timeline really has reached its Renaissance...
The King 2 Hearts,no way... I just started watching it few days ago... love the simplicity of the show and the characters.
The King 2 Hearts,"The great news is that Johnny Hardwick has been taking videos shooting cowboy guns and singing about pocket sand as Dale on Youtube for years, so his voice is primed and ready to go."
The King 2 Hearts,Are they going to replace the voice of Khan with an Asian actor ?
The King 2 Hearts,"As someone who adores this show, had birthday parties revolving around this show, has seen it through over a dozen times…. 


This news is both exciting and worries the shit out of me."
The King 2 Hearts,"You know you're tired when you read this as ""New episodes of KOTH ordered by Judge..."""
The King 2 Hearts,As reminder King of the Hill was viewed as a slice of life in Japan and there were Subs v Dubs over there when it came to this show
The King 2 Hearts,Dang it Bobby
The King 2 Hearts,"As messed up as it is, I hope they kill off luanne and lucky. And an old Hank and Peggy find themselves raising Gracie and GH with help from adult Bobby"
The King 2 Hearts,Well not the WHOLE original cast.
The King 2 Hearts,"Dang ol' Mike Judge man bout time tell you what, watchin reruns for dang ol' three decades man."
The King 2 Hearts,"Dammit, Bobby."
The King 2 Hearts,"“Hey, man, dang ol' listen, man.”"
The King 2 Hearts,"This is one of the best things I've heard this year thus far!! Now this show may not be for everyone but for those who enjoyed it or grew up with it being a presence on their TV this is awesome. Some may say this show is dumb, but this show teaches more values, manners, cultural differences, being thankful, acknowledging a mistake and manning up to own it, respect to others in our lives, and how different people can be. I can't wait for this to aire, just as I'm sure John Redcorn can't wait to fix Nancy's next headache. Lol"
The King 2 Hearts,"The first scene has to be Hank walking in on Bobby listening to music on his wireless earbuds, and Hank wants to listen to this [new generation of music](https://youtu.be/6z1neskULsQ)."
The King 2 Hearts,Look forward to this. Sucks Murphy and Petty are gone.
The King 2 Hearts,"This is kinda like Futurama coming back, I'm hoping for the best. 

KOTH had such a great 13 year run."
The King 2 Hearts,Dangit Bobby
The King 2 Hearts,Time to be bullish on propane and propane accessories again!!
The King 2 Hearts,"Damnit Bobby, you better not be fooling around!"
The King 2 Hearts,"Initial reaction: **(Dale Gribble voice)** Wingo! 

Second thought: **(Hank Hill voice)** Don't screw it up, you giblet heads."
The King 2 Hearts,It’s about durn time!
The King 2 Hearts,I tell you whahat
The King 2 Hearts,There is a God
The King 2 Hearts,"So, no Luanne or Lucky?"
The King 2 Hearts,I am sooooooo happy and excited about this. I can’t wait to get back to Arlen.
The King 2 Hearts,Propane powered electric car chargers
The King 2 Hearts,"I'm calling it now: Hank killed Dr. Phil, the timing can't be a mistake"
The King 2 Hearts,Hell yes!! I've literally started watching rerun clips this past month and enjoying the nostalgia. What great news.
The King 2 Hearts,"""Im driving the hell out this truck"" -Bobby Hill-"
The King 2 Hearts,"So, Dale is going to be pretty much full blown QAnon now, right?"
The King 2 Hearts,"Make it happen! This show is so great, it holds up so well. I recall as a child not getting it or liking it very much, but watching it today. . . It’s so well done.

Edit: except for the episode where Peggy reaches sex-Ed, that was always funny to me. 

“Happiness. . . Haa-piness. . . piness. . . penis. . . PENIS!”"
The King 2 Hearts,Time for some spa-Peggy and meatballs!
The King 2 Hearts,I’m honestly a little worried with what they’ll do with it. I worry it might become a lot more political than it was in the past.
The King 2 Hearts,RIP Luann
The King 2 Hearts,Not a single mention of Luanne. Wtf?! RIP Brittany
The King 2 Hearts,"I mean - Dale has gone full QAnon - or he is Q. Peggy has been exposed on Twitter as a Karen. Hank’s been canceled. Boomhower is killing it on Tender. Bill has lost all his money due to an Onlyfans addiction. Bobby has been radicalized on YouTube. Connie’s GPA has slipped because she’s decided to be a TikToker. Life was so much simpler in 2010, I’ll tell you what."
The King 2 Hearts,"I *loved* King of the Hill, but I don't like this at all. King of the Hill was a show of its time through-and-through, and that time has passed. 

I want to be clear: gatekeeping reboots or sequels is dumb, this is not me saying that anyone excited for this is enjoying themselves wrong, I'm saying that I have serious doubts this particular revival can be done well."
The King 2 Hearts,"**Hank:** Get that dang gum phone outta my face Bobby. What in the hell are you doing? 

**Bobby:** I'm just making a TikTok that's what all of the kids are going these days. 

**Hank:** What the world is a TikTok? 

**Bobby:** It's social media. See you can make videos and share them all over the world. I'm trying to go viral! I'm an influencer!

**Hank:** if you don't out that thing outta my face...

**Peggy:** Hank! You need to encourage Bobby! Try to be more into the things he's into. 

**Hank:** I can't understand why anyone would want influenza. That's it! Tomorrow I'm gonna call the doctor and make sure we get all get our flu shots."
The King 2 Hearts,Not Brittany Murphy :(
The King 2 Hearts,No Tom Petty though. :(
The King 2 Hearts,I’d imagine they’d *never* recast Luanne in respect of Brittany. So does this confirm that they’re retiring the character?
Go! Live Your Way,"Wonder if that means the end of the trio and Grand Tour, or if they'll try and move it elsewhere."
Go! Live Your Way,I think they're at their limit now anyways.  Only so many ways to almost kill Richard Hammond.
Go! Live Your Way,"And on that bombshell, back to the studio"
Go! Live Your Way,Who did he punch this time?
Go! Live Your Way,He is funny.  He is an asshole.
Go! Live Your Way,"I mean, he's old enough to retire, or start just a youtube series where he just drives around and shit."
Go! Live Your Way,"Not shocked. Clarkson is 60-61, but seems so much older. He has not had great health. Doing TV at such a high level is physically and emotionally demanding. Clarkson is very dry and funny, but his controversial comments are also part of that package."
Go! Live Your Way,So long as we get those couple seasons of Clarkson's Farm like the article says... What a show.
Go! Live Your Way,Does…does that mean he’s not coming on then?
Go! Live Your Way,"Is there any chance this means James May will be doing more stuff on his own? That'd be great. I like his travel documentaries, and the reassembler was great too. His skills are wasted when with the other two I think."
Go! Live Your Way,Oh no! Anyway…
Go! Live Your Way,"Grand Tour was okay, but it wasn't hitting the same as OG Top Gear"
Go! Live Your Way,That winter rally car episode was dope
Go! Live Your Way,He should knock out piers morgan again.
Go! Live Your Way,The British seem to have a particular flavor of “get off my lawn” when they get on in years.
Go! Live Your Way,Clarkson is one of my more problematic “likes.”  I like his shows a lot.  I think he’s a clever and fun presenter.  I try to give him the benefit of the doubt but then he keeps doing crap that just makes me wince and then I am embarrassed that I am a fan of his.  I’m sorry to see him go but honestly it may be time.
Go! Live Your Way,"I think it’s more him retiring than being booted off

They still have the drivetribe channel who may benefit from all this and probably more « modest projects » but they are getting old and it’s natural to stop travelling and building mediocre bridges at one point"
Go! Live Your Way,"Fun fact: Clarkson had the world’s very first Paddington Bear stuffed toy.

Made by his mom, then his parents sold them locally, and finally got the licence to make them worldwide."
Go! Live Your Way,"Disappointing! Wonder how many Grand Tour specials that includes and probably signals the end of the trio on TV 

Looking forward to the new season of Clarksons farm"
Go! Live Your Way,2 of the only shows I watch on Amazon tbh
Go! Live Your Way,He's entertaining TV but a nightmare to work with
Go! Live Your Way,I suggest Hammond's show on discovery. Also nice
Go! Live Your Way,"Yes, he's is an asshole. But he's funny as hell, and the chemistry those three had was impeccable.

This is the end of an era. Top Gear was peak tv for quite some time. Grand Tour tried to replicate it, and did a decent job after a few seasons, but it's just proof that all good things must come to an end."
Go! Live Your Way,I say this as a massive fan of his work: Clarkson is such an absolute dumbass. Self sabotaging constantly.
Go! Live Your Way,Say what you I will about Clarkson but the best years of both shows are simply some of the most fun I’ve ever had watching a television. Those three had charm for days.
Go! Live Your Way,"Well that explains the new apology, anyone want to wager it was drafted right before Amazon decided to dump him in order to try and stop that?"
Go! Live Your Way,His farming show is one of the best I have seen in years. So good
Go! Live Your Way,"He is a pathetic racist with a long, long history of shitty behavior, particularly directed at minority support staff."
Go! Live Your Way,Was looking forward to more of the farm show and more grand tour :/
Go! Live Your Way,What an absolutely horrible website!
Go! Live Your Way,"The article says likely, doesn’t sound like anything is official yet 🤷🏻‍♂️"
Go! Live Your Way,Jeremy Clarkson is the worst thing to happen to Jeremy Clarkson’s career since Jeremy Clarkson.
Go! Live Your Way,"Real article headline says “likely to part ways” not that they certainly will. It also only lists “sources say”.

It’s a big rumor article that may most likely happen, but it’s not written in stone yet."
Go! Live Your Way,"Found out here that Clarkson’s Farm still on for Series 2&3. Had to look up when series 2 coming out (Feb. 10). Found that on Digital Spy which starts with “Given his most recent controversial comments we’d have thought Amazon would have dropped him.” 

Ah Jesus, what has he said now? Something about seeing Meghan paraded naked through the streets. I guess I missed that over the Christmas hols.

https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/dec/18/jeremy-clarkson-condemned-meghan-column-the-sun#:~:text=In%20an%20article%20for%20the,lumps%20of%20excrement%20at%20her”."
Go! Live Your Way,"He either looks like an old woman, or old British women look like men with wigs. I can’t figure it out."
Go! Live Your Way,"He keeps pointing to the Game of Thrones reference as something he ballsed up, rather than apologising for saying he thinks she's worse than a literal serial killer.

I can't help but think that this apology was mandated by ITV/Amazon, and that Clarkson had a PR coach help him write it."
Go! Live Your Way,Sad news. Never got into the grand tour but Clarksons farm was surprisingly great on many levels.
Go! Live Your Way,"With Jeremy and James' age and health, I daresay this would be the end of them working as a trio. For myself and many others around my age, they've been a part of our lives for the last 20 years, since the early days of Top Gear. I think we've known for a while that this wouldn't be too far away, but it will still be a very sad day for television when they finally hang up the boots.

Still, at least they've given us enough great content over the years for us to keep ourselves entertained with almost infinite rewatch value."
Go! Live Your Way,"He’s such a stupid dick.

But he’s my stupid dick…."
Go! Live Your Way,I bet Stewart Lee is very happy to hear this.
Go! Live Your Way,"My kid and I used to watch Top Gear all the time with the trio of Captain Slow, the Hampster and Jeremy Clarkson."
Go! Live Your Way,Noooooooo
Go! Live Your Way,"A few days ago i was watching may in italy and told my wife that he only complaints constantly about not wanting to do things through the entire season, and that if i was amazon i would not be happy about it. With these 3 we never know if they are mocking/joking about things or just being dicks but they should retire. I have watched their entire careers in the past 20 years and the decline there for all to see. Even may is now ruining his own show and complaining about having to do basic things travel to places or be with people. To be honest it is frustrating to watch"
Go! Live Your Way,"Kind of felt like the GT was running on fumes for a while.  They are all interesting presenters and I find their solo projects more interesting at this point.

Actually my favorite of Clarkson’s Amazon content is the Farm show.

Grand Tour was definitely a unique project though, I can’t remember another TV show that had that high level of production value.  Even just the setting up of the tents all over the world must have been a nightmare."
Go! Live Your Way,"How do you not, as a public figure, think before you say anything in public? Especially when you're already notorious for saying dumb stuff and getting into trouble?"
Go! Live Your Way,*likely* to part ways. Not confirmed. Wording is important
Go! Live Your Way,"too old now anyway and the jokes have gone stale..  

BUT i hope the season 2 of Clarkson's farm gets made before he's gone.."
Go! Live Your Way,How long before Jeremy Clarkson becomes a Fox News contributor?
Go! Live Your Way,"As much as I don’t want Clarkson, May, and Hammond to part ways I think it’s time. In the last few years 2 of them have been in crashes, both on camera. They’re getting too old to put putting them selfs in that much risk."
Go! Live Your Way,"I was thinking the other day that his days are probably numbered as a presenter and he will likely end up as a c@&t for cash in the same vein as Katie Hopkins and Piers Morgan, just wheeled out to say something controversial to appeal to the “Can’t say nuffin these days” mob."
Go! Live Your Way,i feel old
Go! Live Your Way,Clarkson you infantile pillock!
Go! Live Your Way,"2 more seasons of Clarkson's Farm! What an amazing funny show. The grand tour is also pretty amazing, much much better than Top Gear without the lame british stand up comedy or whatever they used to do"
Go! Live Your Way,The show hasn't really been entertaining for a while. I suddenly realized that watching three old rich white men drive expensive cars wasn't all that different from driving my local streets.
Go! Live Your Way,"Clarkson has always been a baboon. He’s had a long history os saying really awful and stupid things. Amazon knew this and still brought him on board. 

He is a classic case of white, male privilege…is incredulous about something isn’t affecting him directly as being silly or he hasn’t had the life experience to see things differently, so it much be wrong. 

It’s a pity, he’s a legit funny and entertaining TV presenter, but his ego and world view are shocking. 

I hope Harry and Meagan just sent a reply that said “noted” and that’s it."
Go! Live Your Way,"Over to you ITV. Oh wait, they don't have the morals to make a decision like this."
Go! Live Your Way,CLARKSOOOOOOONNNNNNNNN!
Go! Live Your Way,I truly don't understand how this guy has such a following. He's a dickhead.
Go! Live Your Way,"Amazon knew what they were getting when they signed him - that isn't to excuse his actions historically.   I do enjoy his output, and I do have ""*really? why did you have to do that*"" moments when stuff like this happens.

I have no idea how much he gets from TheSun for writing his column, but I hope its worth it.  TheSun readership has a very narrow just-off-the-center-towards-the-right readership, claiming they represent the average working UK person; the same paper that had the infamous Page3 (which many of us grew up on).

It is a shame, and I suspect given the size of budgets required to make the GrandTour, there is no other streamer (Netflix maybe?) that will pick them up.  Time to retire the trio."
Go! Live Your Way,I guess you can only be an insufferable asshole for 30 years until people won’t put up with you anymore.
Go! Live Your Way,Feels like a decade overdue
Go! Live Your Way,"I’m not too surprised tbh, still unfortunate."
Go! Live Your Way,Fuck
Go! Live Your Way,Who did he assault this time?
Go! Live Your Way,"Oh no, anyway."
Go! Live Your Way,Clarkson!!! Seriously get it together man.
Go! Live Your Way,"If there was every a perfect candidate for the roll of dying old, alone and drunk, it's likely to be Jeremy."
Go! Live Your Way,The cynic in me bets that Jeremy was pretty much done anyway and decided to take an unpublicized payday in exchange for Amazon getting to claim it was their idea.
Go! Live Your Way,Oh no…. Anyway
Go! Live Your Way,Title is misleading. It says will part ways whereas in the article it says “likely” without any confirmation from Prime Video.
Go! Live Your Way,To be fair there's only so much now they can do for Grand Tour. I mean the only one that *hasn't* gone through a serious injury on the show is Clarkson.
Go! Live Your Way,lol did they not know who he was before they hired him? Fuckin idiots
Go! Live Your Way,"Relative was speaking with Kaleb just before Christmas and he confirmed that season 2 and season 3 have already been filmed so will
be getting them."
Go! Live Your Way,He’s Roger Mellie for real.
Go! Live Your Way,bet he really hates Megan now
Go! Live Your Way,Time to cancel my Amazon Prime
Go! Live Your Way,He may be a brash inappropriate obnoxious loud mouthed curmudgeon but those decades of Top Gear = some of the best and funniest television ever made.
Go! Live Your Way,"All i see it as is. Amazon to part ways with Jeremy Clarkson, but after about 3 more years. Then after those three years people will forget about all this and we will continue with his shows again."
Go! Live Your Way,No great loss to humanity here.
Go! Live Your Way,https://i.imgur.com/8WevMCS.png
Go! Live Your Way,The last couple episodes of The Grand Tour that were released were some of the best ever including Top Gun.
Go! Live Your Way,"I can't imagine Amazon give a fuck about his Harry and Meghan comments, The contract was probably running out anyway."
Go! Live Your Way,"Damnit Jezza, why Amazon? Jeremy and the Grand Tour are the best thing to happen to Prime Video. Who cares what he says, keep on producing more shows. Ever since Amazon picked up the Top Gear hosts you can tell they have a good budget and every episode has been quality. I look forward to every new season and am looking forward to more seasons of Clarkson’s Farm too"
Go! Live Your Way,Can Clarkson and Piers just disappear?
Go! Live Your Way,"gonna miss him, that's for sure. Love Jeremy.  As long as there is more of his Farm I'm a content bloke"
Go! Live Your Way,"As an ignorant American, can I get the tl/dr on why Brits hate Markle so much?"
Go! Live Your Way,"Such a joke. He was intentionally controversial, that’s why people love him."
Go! Live Your Way,Fuck megan. Done.
Go! Live Your Way,"These dudes just want to retire and enjoy being rich. I mean it's already basically what they do they just manage to finesse tv studios to pay them for it, kind of.

They're rich enough and old enough and have done enough episodes to not want to continue.

Legends honestly, its not the highest brow or most polished content out there but its like 20 seasons of it and it's all at least decent.

The international specials in particular are great stuff, some of the most wide-ranging content out there in terms of countries and places visited, in very unique circumstances a lot of the time."
Go! Live Your Way,His farming show was dope
Go! Live Your Way,Amazon LIKELY to part ways....way to leave that out OP. This article is a fluff piece. Their evidence is a canceled meeting...
Go! Live Your Way,Good. Fuck Jeremy Clarkson.
Go! Live Your Way,It’s the age of technology. Start your own channel Jeremy. I’ll be watching.
Go! Live Your Way,Good riddance.
Go! Live Your Way,Who gives a fuck about Harry and Meghan
Go! Live Your Way,"While I disagree with his hatred of Meghan Markle he clearly was making a joke (poorly) and as a comedian I don't think he should be raked over the coals this much. The man apologized, nobody was hurt, can we move on?"
Go! Live Your Way,"""I am fine with Amazon treating workers horribly, busting them unionising and destroying untold numbers of businesses, but I will not stand for them having a show where a host makes a dumb Game of Thrones reference in a newspaper article attacking the King of England's daughter in law.""

What a truly dumb timeline we exist in."
Go! Live Your Way,"Relax guys, we still have Ezra Miller, who can choke slam women, plead guilty to criminal acts, and still keep his job. But this guy? Whoa he’s terrible. ( and he is, surprised he was still allowed to work for so long )"
Go! Live Your Way,Good riddence. Clarkson is piece of shit human being.
Go! Live Your Way,Clarkson is a tosser
Revenge,Love me some Stevie Y.
Revenge,"Glad to see that it's good. 
Love Steven and Ali. 
Looking forward to seeing the show"
Revenge, r/BeefTV is the sub in case anyone interested. I hope this'll help fans find it since it's new.     :)
Revenge,"Bertie and Speckle, together again."
Revenge,everytime i see the title for this show the playboi carti song immediately starts playing in my head. lol.
Revenge,Love Steven Yeun but it goes to show you how important hairstyle is on some people. Buzz cut definitely doesn't work for him and with it he loses his boyishness that I'd argue is a large part of his appeal.
Revenge,So is it a miniseries or is it planned to have multiple seasons if it gets renewed? I'd much prefer the former.
Revenge,It was cool seeing Ali play a more serious role in Paper Girls.
Revenge,My favorite functionally dysfunctional relationship!
Revenge,who want beef wit me
Revenge,Why does the trailer make it look like a Victorian vampire movie?
Revenge,"*""Not as good as I hoped it would be...""*"
Revenge,The weirdest thing about this trailer is that i could recognize the story not by its title but because south park did a parody episode of it once.i have no doubt its a good book iv never read it probley gonna watch this though
Revenge,"aaand of course we need woke controversy, so we give a black woman without any reason."
Revenge,Still no footage of the robot monkeys. I'm starting to worry that they didn't have the budget to do them justice.
Revenge,"well, in a way the audience is supposed to be creeped out when Pip is in Haversham's room. So the trailer is doing the show a service by signaling to audiences that there is something to be scared of."
Revenge,One might say your expectations are too great
Revenge,I saw south park episode when I was around 12. I watched the movie when I was around 16. I was getting really worried because of how accurate south park was that we might actually get a woman trying to take the sadness of men for her youth using a machine
Revenge,I've read the book and it's really good. It feels so timeless. I'd definitely recommend it if you are someone who reads books frequently.
Revenge,"So it's woke controversy now if a PoC just exists and dares to be cast in a show? In a woke show that's an adaptation of a classic Charles Dicken work that tackles the class system of Victorian England in a story in which an orphan moves up within that rigid class system. You know an already pretty ""woke"" thing to do and write about.....

But judging from your comments. I shouldn't be surprised that you're foaming at the mouth for the mere existence of a black woman in a fantasy show."
Revenge,"I used to,time and failing eyesight makes it less common these days"
Revenge,"Counterpoint: it's Charles Dickens and while I appreciate what he wrote, I would never go out of my way to recommend him to anyone."
Revenge,"She was cast only because she is black, it's obvious. Dickens wrote nothing about a black orphan in his book. If you wanted to be so politically correct, she could at least be of Indian descent - its GB not US where the action takes place.

And yes, I don't like it when characters in books like elves with very light skin are played by black people. Somehow the inhabitants of Wakanda can be black, no one puts whites and Asians there."
Revenge,">Dickens wrote nothing about a black orphan in his book. 

Writers don't write about a lot of things. Doesn't stop the themes they wrote about from being applicable to everyone. And this may be shocking to you, but Britain was a) a colonialist empire that had god knows how many countries and territories under it's belt. b) that means people of a multitude of ethnicities and skin shades lived under colonial rule. Not just people from India and of Indian descent. I know schools fail to teach history, but come on, google is practically right there.  


This doesn't erase the fact that even within Britain proper, black people lived in the country (and yes during the time when Dickens was alive and writing novels). And a portion of them had Knighthood, peerage, or, rarely, were members of nobility. Queen Victoria had a black goddaughter. There was just a film, based on a true story, of a black girl who was raised by her father amongst English nobility.  


>Somehow the inhabitants of Wakanda can be black

My jelly brained brother in christ. Wakanda is a fictional nation set in Africa that has never been colonized and has had closed borders since the inception of Marvel. What color do you expect Wakandan's to be? Blue?   
And elves are fictional characters. No one complains when elves are any other color of the rainbow, including having stars for skin. But the moment one elf is black or looks black, suddenly its a ""this is ruining my fantasy!"" moment."
Revenge,"> What color do you expect Wakandan's to be?

Careful, dude is probably one of those that ironically thinks ""HoW WoULd yoU feeL If a WHItE aCTOr WAS CasT AS MLK OR Malcom X???"" was an incisive retort."
Revenge,">Wakanda is a fictional nation set  
>  
>And elves are fictional characters

First class logic. So Wakanda is fictional, there can be aliens but people cant be blue or asians there. But elves accurately described by Tolkien or Sapkowski as white - we can employ black actors. Actually not ""can"" - we have to, at least one. I am liberal but it's my right that I don't like it - the destruction of immersion in series in recent years. According to Tolkien all Dwarves are described as having beards. But not black actress in Rings of Power.   
If Peter Jackson's The Lord of the Rings was filmed today, some members of the fellowship would have to be black characters (with probably gay thread).

Anyway Anny Boleyn wasn't fictional - but Jodie Turner-Smith was probably the only actress available at the time :)"
Revenge,"Why don’t people ever answer this? They cast Ghandi with a white man and he did fine. If the actor is selected for talent great. 

Is that so controversial"
Revenge,"> They cast Ghandi with a white man

1. Whatever happened to that Gandhi spelling bot .....
1. Ben Kingsley? The ""white"" man born [Krishna Pandit Bhanji and is ethnically Indian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Kingsley#Early_life)?"
Revenge,His wife kissed me on the cheek when I came in. And now look at him.
Revenge,Always down for more Speckles and Bertie.
Revenge,Why is she dressed like the love interests best friend from the goofy movie
Revenge,A whole movie of revenge brought on by too small of slices used for gigantic mud pies.
Revenge,Wild revenge filled ride for a doorknob
Revenge,"Alright, I can’t wait for more [INVINCIBLE TITLE CARD]"
Revenge,the BEEF DVDs from the 2000s were better

Revenge,"Yo, Stacey! Talk to me, talk to me, talk to me, baby!"
Revenge,And she’s holding an upside-down flacid penis and balls.
Revenge,"Stacey could get it, classic glow up tale. Catch her in 10 years and she would be a 10"
Revenge,He lives in that ugly house where you can see the KFC through the front window.
Revenge,*Busts out Powerline dance moves* God I loved that movie so much as a kid 🥲
Revenge,Just like me when I’m watching A Goofy Movie
Revenge,"Man I really hate these types of articles / websites. There is nothing more frustrating when you’re trying to read the article and it just repeats what it just said but in a different way, like man just tell me."
Revenge,That was a surprisingly really hard to read article in need of an editor.
Revenge,"Me “Wow what a really good and fun episode of she hulk”

Me 2 minutes later; Oh no oh shit oh fuck"
Revenge,Remember when she hinted that we might see red Hulk just before this scene?
Revenge,Had no idea Cody Ziglar was writing for this show
Revenge,"So I did a term search for ""revenge"" in this long ass article, there are 3 results, 2 in the title and sub title and 3 is in the intro para. 


Rest of the article is about.... Well anything"
Revenge,What? Did this show take a turn in tone?
Revenge,You ever read a comment section and wonder who’s the bots? Or are they real people but we think they’re bots because there’s a lot of bots with similar comments on other threads. Who’s upvoting and downvoting? How many of them are bots? How much of the opinions that the tribes in these threads have are formed by their interactions with bots? How much THC was in that gummy? Are fingernails bones???
Revenge,It makes me happy that the series has made the shitty online trolls big bads of the show.
Revenge,These comments don't seem real.
Revenge,"The moment where she looks up into the camera and is finally at a total loss.of words was really powerful. It was such a jarring moment and made me even more glad they included all the fourth wall breaking, just to get to that moment. It was heartbreaking."
Revenge,"It may be too much to ask for a second season, but I really adore this show. I'm invested in Jen in such a relatable way, unlike almost every other unreasonably heroic Marvel character."
Revenge,That article was tedious to get through
Revenge,My partner and I were watching and she instantly said it was too dramatic. I said “huh?” And she explained that in the real world everyone else in the room would be super fucking pissed and not bat an eye at the destroying of tvs and or responsible people.
Revenge,"My wife is not a marvel fan - she doesn't like superheroes, she doesn't like watching overly male narratives. I'd read the comics of she-hulk and was really excited and I think marvel hit the demo perfectly: my wife *loves* She-Hulk and we watch it on release every week. My only gripe is that it's only half and hour, which feels too short for the credits etc, but for whatever reason comedy is only a half hour.  
  
She-hulk is fun, it doesn't take itself too seriously, it's really true to the comics. It's just women's narratives and that doesn't have to be everyone's cup of tea but I've found it really authentic to a lot of things women experience and say and making it fun in a superhero way."
Revenge,Those are some brave bad guys. She’s 6’7 and can wrestle the hulk! How dumb do you have to be to mess with her?
Revenge,"Damn, the new episode scored a 7.9 on IMDb even with all the review bombings going on. Been sleeping on the show but might watch it now.

Edit: lol some people seem rather upset that I called the weirdly out of place [mass 1 star ratings](https://m.imdb.com/title/tt11261206/ratings/?ref_=tt_ov_rt) ""review bombing"""
Revenge,Just wait until the Wong-Madisynn sextape comes out.
Revenge,The astroturfing in these comments is crazy.
Revenge,"Yes, she gave her last look to the camera while in pissed off hulk mode after knocking the building around a bit and looked scared at her reaction. My wife and I just thought, you’re good girl, let it out, this is an insane situation and quite messed up, you deserve to be mad."
Revenge,"I like the show. It's fun and light and reminds me of that period of comics round about when Runaways debuted that were pretty much that; fun and light. 

I think a lot of the criticism about the politics of the show are about disagreeing with those politics more than an actual criticism of the show itself."
Revenge,[deleted]
Revenge,Even though the 4th wall break alluded to a twist. I did not see that coming. I feel for anyone who has been subjected to this. It must be an awful fucking feeling.
Revenge,It’s all Josh’s fault
Revenge,Havent seen the verge in a minute wtf is that logo??
Revenge,If you made a sex tape of me and tried to show it to my parents I'd want to launch your ass into space.
Revenge,"Personally, the series hasn’t been super great for me, but that last episodes change in tone really worked. Glad i’m sticking around for a Marvel shows finale this time around."
Revenge,I don't know how people like this show. It is so beyond cringey. I find myself having to skip past chunks of it because it's so painful to sit through.
Revenge,This show it terrible.
Revenge,[deleted]
Revenge,"I'll be honest, I didn't like the show. I haven't watched daredevil either, so I didn't know what to expect. 

I've found most of the show to be terrible and preachy. In fact, even when Matt Murdock came into the picture, it made me angry as to how non-antagonistically Jen viewed Matt Murdock, despite being shown as professionally headstrong in her previous scenes.

However, I found that the chemistry between she hulk and daredevil to be endearing, sans the cringeworthy dialogue. Yet, it made the show more than tolerable. 

SO, when in the 8th episode, we see Jen legitimately hulk out and see herself as a monster, Bruce is somewhat redeemed because he had tried to warn Jen against these exact things. This is the exact situation that Bruce was trying to prevent Jen from getting into. Moreover, the CGI has gotten better for the last 2 episodes and I'd love to see more action and drama instead of a saturation of the latter."
Revenge,"I felt so sad for SheHulk, like I'm glad i'm empathetic but damn to be embarrassed like that in front of all your peers and colleagues and i assume for a woman its a lot harder to be respected in those spaces..just felt so sad and ashamed for her and i think her raging was totally warranted. like fuck, i think anyone would rage and fee so embarrassed if their sex tape was put on the big screen. but does this only work against women? or would a guy rage to if a girl put his sex tape on display in front of his colleagues after winning an award?"
Revenge,"Ah yes, once again the cabal of rapists and degenerates that is Hollywood have come down from their ivory towers to preach morals to the unwashed masses."
Revenge,Jesus fucking Christ this comment section. I have to conclude there is a big amount of people that don't even watch the show downvoting everything. One dude says one thing: downvoted to oblivion. Another dude says THE OPPOSITE: also downvoted to oblivion. What the fuck is going on?
Revenge,"Wait, what? There are people actually watching that show?!"
Revenge,"I'm just salty that She-Hulk received a whole freaking show where as The actual original Hulk is left on the sidelines to do nothing, again. Like why couldn't it have been a Hulk show that featured She-Hulk instead?"
Revenge,"I find it a bit weird that two of the “female-lead” Marvel projects that immediately come to mind (Captain Marvel and She-Hulk) have plots that only really work within the context of “boy, doesn’t it suck to be female in a male-dominated society?”

The only other female lead Marvel thing I can think of is Black Widow which was a fairly generic “bad guys are doing a bad thing. Also, trauma from your past” plot.

I don’t think 66% of the male-led Marvel stuff only works with a male character. Let me do a mental list:

Star Lord’s character would work just as well if they were female.

Iron Man would work if it was a female billionaire tech genius.

Captain America, admittedly, only really makes sense as male because they’re a WW2 front-line soldier.

Hawkeye could have been a female archer.

Black Panther could have been female.

Thor is based off of a male Norse god so being male is kind of mandatory.

Spider-Man sorta needs them to be male for the “spitting web uncontrollably” to be a puberty metaphor but that’s kind of a minor detail and not even really a thing in the MCU’s Spider-Man.

So around a third of the male-dominated superheroes’ stories wouldn’t have worked without a male lead.

It’s a bit of a weird ratio. I guess there are more male superheroes in Marvel and, with only three female superhero stuff there’s a pretty small sample size. Hopefully future projects will have the lead just be female and it not being such a big deal that the plot needs to be about it."
Revenge,As a straight male in his 30’s I love this show. There’s nothing like it.
Revenge,I never understood why people hated this show... CGI is weak yeah but other than that it's really fun.
Revenge,"I feel like this show's been going on forever now with how much space it takes up in tv/pop-culture conversation. Can't wait for this shit to be over, honestly."
Revenge,"This show is just what I want; comedy Marvel.

Did someone seriously report this as a suicidal post?

Terrible."
Revenge,"I haven't see articles on the best episode in the series, Episode 7 😭 this one pissed me off at the end in a good way plus daredevil, probably second best episode"
Revenge,"That episode where she goes to court with Titania who is suing her for using the name She Hulk and she has to resort to, how was it said? Using a line of “questionable men” she met on a dating app to back up her case and they all take the stand and embarrass the hell out of her was the funniest, most relatable thing I’ve seen on film in like a million years. I’m super old and I don’t remember the last time I laughed that friggin hard. I thought I was going to have a seizure."
Revenge,She-hulk is basically “if Reddit made a show” lol
Revenge,"Well and people will still judge her for it
 Seriously...fuck them"
Revenge,"The screenshot they took of the scene shows her bank account with 8k in savings, my my how bourgeois"
Revenge,Did they really change Intelligencia from a cabal of the smartest people on earth to a bunch of incels? Why? If so every time I hear about them using an obscure thing from the comics like this I just shake my head at the wasted potential.
Revenge,[deleted]
Revenge,"So, full disclosure, i havent seen any of she hulk, or, actually, anything marvel related since i was bored and disappointed by the end of wandavision but the main antagonist is basically reddit? 

That's pretty good, really."
Revenge,Was that the takeaway this episode? I'm been loving She-Hulk but it's just some incels who want the blood of She-Hulk (blood for science purposes)
Revenge,"Is this really what their audience are interested in? Super heroes fighting online trolls? Not aliens or supervillains, just antisocial dudes with internet connections? What a boring audience"
Revenge,Idk maybe I’m alone in this but I gave up on this show halfway through episode 3 or 4. I think it’s maybe the pandering 4th walls breaks? Or I’m just getting tired of Disney marvel content. Anyone else feel this way?
Revenge,Why do the trolls hate this show so much? Is it because they are the butt of the joke a lot and are made out as the villains.
Revenge,The MCU is a complete joke now
Revenge,"They show really hit its stride with this episode.. They managed to give us a great blend between between sitcom, lighthearted action and social issues/incel commentary. Maslani and Cox have great chemistry and I hope they get to share the screen again if the show comes back."

ThirTEEN Terrors,"as a 26 year old, I always thought of adult swim as way pavers. I remember falling asleep on the living room couch of a 4 room, 700 sq ft apartment instead of in my bed so I could watch some samurai champloo before bed at 11 at night as a 14 year old. I even vaguely remember flcl and even after all these years, the one thing that stood out was the fu-ri-ku-ri television robot. 

are millenials the generation of nostalgia? have we progressed to quickly? "
ThirTEEN Terrors,"I'll never forget that fucking April Fool's Day. 4 years ago.

Midnight, seeing what Adult Swim had in store for this April Fool's. Steve Blum apparently made a vague random tweet earlier that day. But I didn't see it.

Soon The Room played. Again, like last year. but then suddenly *boom*. Motherfucking TOM. Then Bleach started playing. Thought it was a good joke. Then the bumpers played. ""No way."", I thought. Then I was watching the end of the Cell Saga. Holy **SHIT.** Then it was Gundam, then Trigun. Goddamn. 

Ironically it was one of the highest ratings Adult Swim got in years. A month later, Toonami was back. It went through a bit of rollercoaster of ratings. A few duds(Casshern, Samurai 7) but also a few golds(Kill la Kill, Space Dandy, One Punch Man).

Now, Toonami is going to give us a new season of Samurai Jack, and new season of FLCL, a new Production IG series(people who made IGPX), and (next month) Jojo's Bizarre Adventure.

ThirTEEN Terrors,I was in a really bad place 15 years ago and this late night spot gave me smiles as a preteen. Lots of laughs and some great anime. It really brightened up my life till college. I actually met my husband on the adult swim message boards. He still watches some of the shows :) 
ThirTEEN Terrors,You didn't mention Robot Chicken. The Star Wars specials are some of the most priceless stop-motion gems ever.
ThirTEEN Terrors,"Awesome post.

I tried to think of why they would cancel ATHF, and I now believe that it has to do with the fact that Adult Swim is stronger than ever. That makes me feel confident that they will bring back ATHF when they need a boost in ratings. The show needs to recharge for a few years.

Master Shake and Carl are two of the greatest characters in the entire Adult Swim lineup."
ThirTEEN Terrors,Wow this is incredible. I didn't realize I witnessed the birth of Adult Swim. What a ride it's been. Thanks for this fucking amazing post. 
ThirTEEN Terrors,"No mention of ""Venture Brothers"". For Shame."
ThirTEEN Terrors,">(The Critic has been off for 6 but who cares?)

ThirTEEN Terrors,I used to stay up till 2 just to watch Gundam Wing uncensored. It was such a happy jolt to my 16-year-old self when the characters would swear. I also had a huge lady boner over Quatre.
ThirTEEN Terrors,"I'd point out that season 3 or Moral Orel was quite serious, but I guess it wasn't really serialized that much. Still one of my favorite shows."
ThirTEEN Terrors,"I remember when it first started. I was a teenager, and was just wowed by the abject absurdity of shows like Space Ghost, Sealab 2021, and Aqua Teen. It also introduced me to anime through Cowboy Bebop. The downside, at the time, was that it only aired on Thursdays and Sundays at midnight. I'd not yet accepted my night owl tendencies, so I didn't get to catch it every week. But it was definitely a reason to stay up late. I was particularly obsessed with Space Ghost and Brak. It was the Napster era, and I made an entire playlist of Brakisms. Over an hour of nonstop Brak. It was a good time to be young and weird."
ThirTEEN Terrors,Holy fuck I miss Mission Hill
ThirTEEN Terrors,"Wasn't Lucy, Daughter of the Devil on adult swim too?  That show was awesome."
ThirTEEN Terrors,And yet Korgoth was never picked up :(
ThirTEEN Terrors,"I got the honor to meet and chat with C. Martin Croker, voice of Zorak and Moltar on Space Ghost. He said originally that Lazzo wanted to create new Hannah Barbara serials from old animation reels of A-List characters like Yogi Bear. They were told no and instead could purchase the animation reels, and rights, to D-List characters like Space Ghost and Sealab 2020. 

Of those reels was the Wacky Races, which Lazzo wanted to take and create something called ""Wacky Races Coast-to-Cost"" which would take all the previous episode animation reels and make one big event out of it. And, as Croker said, Lazzo had a fever dream the night before of production of the prototype in '93 and instead told the team they'd be creating a new adult themed cartoon talk show. Long story short, the prototype is presented, green lit, and aired as Space Ghost Coast-to-Coast. "
ThirTEEN Terrors,"adult swim bumps basically created my current day taste in music

ThirTEEN Terrors,"http://toonamiaftermath.com/
For those who wish to reminisce on the old CN and includes Adult Swim. Plays out like you're actually watching tv back then. First timers should check out the schedule to see what it's all about.

Also check out http://nreboot.com/watch#cnr"
ThirTEEN Terrors,"Space Ghost Coast to Coast, pre-Adult Swin days, were just amazing. I don't even remember how I stumbled upon it, but I remember watching it at my grandparents house when I was about 8--- and my mother walking in to see why I was up so late and what I was watching--- and laughing significantly harder than I was. 

The entire thing was bizarre.

I also remember those old Hana Barbara Space Ghost + Bird Man + Herculoid episodes that were airing late at night with laugh tracks that my father found both nostalgic and hysterical.

I loved it, because my parents would watch cartoons with me, even though I didn't really understand half the jokes."
ThirTEEN Terrors,"I don't even watch TV. Never really did. But I've always kept up at least a little with Adult Swim. These days I like getting stoned and watching Off The Air. Superjail satisfies my twisted side. I want Brak back.

Brak 4 President"
ThirTEEN Terrors,"This is a great write up.  I was in college when it started, we had a fun group meeting up to watch that insanity when it was on. Sealab was my favorite.  When Venture Bros. hit, though, wow. 

It's also where I first saw Cowboy Bebop, unreal.  "
ThirTEEN Terrors,"Man...I remember staying up late to watch FLCL when it first aired. I was 13, and wasn't supposed to be up that late, so I had to turn the volume almost all the way down where I couldn't even understand the dialogue. All I heard was mumbling and the (amazingly done) soundtrack behind the crazy visuals, and together it made for such a surreal experience, it was amazing. I remember craving the feeling it gave me and I'd scour the internet for anything related to FLCL. This was long before youtube so the best I got was a fanmade page with some sparse info and I must have read it over 20 times just waiting for Sunday night to come again.

 The whole thing had such a profound effect on 13 year old me and I attribute so much of my taste in movies/TV/music to sneaking episodes of FLCL on adult swim. 
"
ThirTEEN Terrors,[deleted]
ThirTEEN Terrors,"Great write up, Adult Swim revitalized the animation industry in some aspects, leading to more animation jobs within the country, and given entertainment the ability to ""be weird"" again. I don't think we'd have Bob's Burgers, Archer, Bojack Horseman, and more without it."
ThirTEEN Terrors,"Alan Resnick is just by favorite person in the world, and I follow all of his writings, and took part in the ARG, and I can't wait to see what's coming next"
ThirTEEN Terrors,"Most importantly. It gave us Rick and Morty.

In all seriousness, I remember watching adult swim as a child and being engulfed. I would stay up late to watch these not so child appropriate shows and giggle my ass off. Thank you Adult Swim for bringing joy to all us TV addicted kids around the world. "
ThirTEEN Terrors,">It boosted the careers of Killer Mike, Flying Lotus, Odd Future, MF Doom, Danger Mouse, and completely made the career of MC Chris. It introduced Killer Mike and El-P

Funny thing, I barely knew about Adult Swim and never watched before I started listening to MF Doom, Madlib and Dangermouse. Those guys legitimized the channel for me. The first time I watched it there was a commercial or promo that used ""Accordian"" and I was sold. "
ThirTEEN Terrors,"Frisky Dingo was everything. I love how you can see and hear the roots of so many Archer memes, while still having a show that stood on its own and was honestly edgier in many ways. Although no bus driver ever knows how to respond when I ask if they go to all pet stores."

ThirTEEN Terrors,"""Natatorium, what's a natatorium?""  Not even google spell check knows, that's funny.

As a college student during 2001, Adult Swim came out and was amazing.  It was perfect background noise and perfect comedy.  I loved every moment.  My favorite moment you didn't mention.

[Aquaman Dance Party](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpopXL2h33U)

Everytime an ADP came on I fell in love with Adult Swim more and more.  There was never and reason given why he was dancing, no background, just dance.

Little shameless promotion, but it inspired me years later to recreate it.

Lazzo and the crew gathered the whole network into the photo studio studio deep inside of the Turner Mansion to explain that we were no longer just fighting against Disney and Nickelodeon for eyeballs.

Harvey Birdman's finale

FullMetal Alchemist's penultimate episode (the first anime)

ThirTEEN Terrors,"Ah the days of rushing home from school so I could watch Sailor Moon, DBZ, Outlaw Star, Ronin Warriors, and Gundam Wing.

Then as I grew older, so did the network, introducing me to adult swim and Chrono Crusade, FMA, Evangelion, etc.

Here's to you guys for making late nights later and better!"
ThirTEEN Terrors,Not a single mention of Robot Chicken? I am *disgusted*...
ThirTEEN Terrors,"This is unrelated but I figured this is where you I could be helped.

29 here. Grew up loving SuperDaves and Adam Wests. Grew up with YTV.  Rugrats, Street Sharks, Mummies Alive, Biker Mice From Mars, Reboot, Beast Wars etc etc the list goes on.

You know what type of kid I am now.

Late night telethon.   Bondage puppets having sex during commercials. Some crippled head and his crippled buddies rich. I need names of these shows late at night..

Most importantly.. Some drab, dry humour from what I remember space cartoon.  A super famous StarShip Captain trapped on a planet with a weird day night cycle or something.  Anyone know the name?"
ThirTEEN Terrors,"So I was watching the first night, in my parent's basement. I was 13. I recorded it and kept the tape for a long time - it might still be at my mom's house. 

SGC2C is 100% responsible for Adult Swim existing, no matter what the execs say. Dave Willis et al were responsible for the aesthetic of fucking with the audience. SGC2C did this for 2-3 seasons before Adult Swim existed. This informs an entire generation's idea of what comedy is. 

Without SG2C2 there would be no Tim and Eric. And no matter how you feel about Awesome Show or TGTTM, you cannot deny that those dudes have had an enormous impact on comedy in the 21st century. 

And let's not forget The Eric Andre Show, directly influenced by SGC2C and produced by Tim and Eric's production company, which has been huge during this election cycle. 

AND - perhaps the biggest Adult Swim-related ""political"" guy of all - Vic Berger, a former editor for Awesome Show. 

Somewhat unrelated but just as influential are dudes like Jon Benjamin and Brendan Small. Both have continued to make a huge impact on modern comedy since Adult Swim started. 

There's also David Wain/Paul Scheer's crew - NTSF:SD:SUV, Children's Hospital, Newsreaders, etc. All those guys were successful before, but Adult Swim gave them the freedom to do their own shows. 

And of course, there's Morel Orel which is the reason Rick and Morty exists. 

(Also it ""saved"" Family Guy but who gives a shit, we're talking about comedy)

ThirTEEN Terrors,"""Pod six is jerks!"""
ThirTEEN Terrors,"I honestly don't think that Adult Swim's role in bringing Anime west could be downplayed. While Toonami played a large part as well, Adult Swim followed through in bringing many people in contact with more mature animated shows and shared in a rarer approach of giving a product that had been very sparingly edited for American audiences.

Also, the Brak Show and Harvey Birdman have remained two of my favorite shows since I first watched them."
ThirTEEN Terrors,"I remember growing up with adult swim, starting just with family guy, and seemingly every year I would get to stay up a little later and experience a new hilarious show - Aqua Teen, then Venture Bros, then Tim and Eric, Drinky Crow, 12oz Mouse - and they always got weirder and more enthralling the later it got. At this point it produces the only shows I can watch over and over again. It introduced me to so many new forms of comedy and humor, how can you not idolize the crazy minds behind it all. "
ThirTEEN Terrors,"I still remember the night Adult Swim premiered.
Working as a security guard for a then soon to be defunct VC business, down in a basement across from One American Center. Surrounded by all the perks of a startup - arcade, soda stand, and tv and not a single soul in sight. I had seen the commercials but no idea what to expect. 

I. Loved. Every. Minute. Of. It.

Watched every new show, laughed at the absurdity of Sealab and couldn't take my eyes off of Cowboy Bebop. Good times made better with Adult Swim, I wish they still played Anime during the week instead of just Saturdays though.
Just wanted to share my first memories and be a part of this thread. "
ThirTEEN Terrors,I remember it being advertised late at night before it premiered when I was in middle school and thought that I had to watch it at all costs. I was fortunate enough to have cable television in my room back then. I still remember watching it the night of the premier and being super hyped about how amazing all the shows were.

ThirTEEN Terrors,"I've been wondering for years when Adult Swim would garner enough popularity and capital to have their own independent TV channel. Unfortunately, I don't think the state of TV will allow for this. At any rate, Adult Swim is a juggernaut and will probably continue to exist in some form for a long time."
ThirTEEN Terrors,"I remember when Adultswim happened. My parents were pretty mad at the time that Cartoon Network would be showing adult content instead of ""cartoons"""
ThirTEEN Terrors,Their bumps are always entertaining.
ThirTEEN Terrors,"I think when they first started airing, I just found it because I liked Space Ghost Coast to Coast but the airings before AS were always done inconsistently and at horseshit hours. Also their original bumps were weird and all set to [this music](https://youtu.be/WGZDDgQvDMc?t=2m16s) for as long as I can recall."
ThirTEEN Terrors,">Even back then at a children’s focused channel like Cartoon Network, however, it was obvious animation wasn’t just for ~~adults~~  

children  

Also, your home movies link is broken. (ish)"
ThirTEEN Terrors,Swear it was longer than 15 years
ThirTEEN Terrors,Shameless plug for everyone to watch Last Stream on the Left today at 7:30pm Eastern! Megustalations.
ThirTEEN Terrors,man that was a great writeup. thanks for taking the time to do it.
ThirTEEN Terrors,"Was anyone else surprised that ""15 years ago"" was referring to 2001?"
ThirTEEN Terrors,Harvey Birdman and Sealab were the GOATs.
ThirTEEN Terrors,Fooley cooley season2!!!!!???
ThirTEEN Terrors,"Until I get season 5 of Metalocalypse and closure to the story line, my motto is ""fuck adult swim"". I'm putting my blinders on to the plethora of awesome shit you do since you shit on the most awesome of them all."
ThirTEEN Terrors,"Adult swim changed my life and made me realize anyone can make shitty, ridiculous, and fun cartoons. I now do it as a job and while its not always perfect, I never regret it. I really do love adult swim and the person it has helped shaped me to be. "
ThirTEEN Terrors,"So Metalocalypse is never getting finished? 

That is a sad thing. It was the best thing ever put out on AS. 

"
ThirTEEN Terrors,"Interesting read. All I knew about Mike Lazzo was from this copypasta on 4chan.

* has disowned his involvement in Space Ghost Coast to Coast
* gave Home Movies low priority compared to Williams Street originals, sometimes airing new episodes at 3 AM and months apart from each other; eventually cancelled it because it was cheaper to rerun Family Guy in it's place
* told the creators of Moral Orel to make the show darker, cancelled it for being ""too dark""
* cancelled China Il and Aqua Teen without letting the creators have a say
* refused to give Stroker and Hoop a Season 2 pickup despite previously stating otherwise, leaving the show to end on a cliffhanger
* bought the rights to millions of dollars in FOX reruns which squandered the budget for Mission Hill's potential revival
* has a hard on for Tim and Eric and Seth McFarlane shows 
* won't give Metalocalypse another season to wrap up the series because of a petty argument over creative control with Brendon Small
* was a major proponent of Loiter Squad and was instrumental in keeping it on air as long as it was
* almost passed up on Rick and Morty in favor of Mr. Pickles
* got into some random internet fight with Jon Benjamin and David Cross for some reason
* will all but let corporate sponsors fuck him in the ass at this point; wants Adult Swim to be ""more like TBS""
* is now pushing for the development of ""a Tosh.0 type program"" made in conjuncture with Worldstar Hip Hop.com
* his favorite Adult Swim program of all time is apparently Robot Chicken"
ThirTEEN Terrors,I miss space ghost coast to coast... I still watch the old episodes sometimes on my hard drive.
ThirTEEN Terrors,"I refuse to watch that station due their dickbag attitude towards Small and Metalocalypse fans. But whatever, keep rerunning the shit Family Guy show for the next generation of college kids."
ThirTEEN Terrors,Adult swim airing anime is what made it more known in the West. Such an influential network. Kudos.
ThirTEEN Terrors,Hard to imagine who I'd be if Adult Swim wasn't created.
ThirTEEN Terrors,"man, this brings back memories. i remember seeing adult swim for the first time. such great shows, besides the obvious ones but things like baby blues, mission hill, stroker and hoop, and many more. it was such a journey growing up with it. it got me into so many different animes that i would have never seen if they weren't on adult swim. i honestly don't know what TV would be like without it."
ThirTEEN Terrors,Best Space Ghost interview was with Triumph the Insult Dog. 
ThirTEEN Terrors,"I love seeing some of the shows that I really don't like are some people favorites. I always knew the ones I like are weird and unique and special, it's cool to see the ones that I don't connect with have the same impact on other fans. Way to go adult swim. art is nothing without experimenting. "
Three Girls,"I give credit to the BBC for making this as it is still a very controversial subject. But its people like [Andrew Norfolk](http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2017-05-16/how-did-this-happen) that are the true heros.

Lets just hope 'Three Girls' helps start a conversion. This is still very much a widespread problem that no one wants to address. Girls are still being groomed and raped on a large scale."
Three Girls,"I saw the first episode, and it was OK. They aren't really showing how horrible this situation was for everyone involved, and seem to be brushing over a lot of details. But it's certainly a situation where the government bureaucrats were worried more about protecting their jobs than hundreds of children."
Three Girls,"This show is about the organised and systematic grooming and rape of young white english girls by muslim men (yes muslim I wont be politically correct and say asian or ""pakistani origins"" they are muslims, all of them)

It not only shows the horror and calculating methods these ""men"" use it also highlights how ridiculously ineffective and down right incompetent the UK police and local governments are. They are more interested in protecting the perpetrators that the victims, they are scared to be called racist and islamaphobic if they pursue convictions.

This still goes on today and is one of the MANY injustices in this country perpetrated by politicians and police too scared to do anything about it in the name of political correctness.

Take Tommy Robinson as a prime example - He has been a voice in the crowds in the UK, warning of these gangs and trying to ge the word out there, he works for a news outlet now called ""Rebel Media"" on official rebel media business he has been attending courts in the UK where these ""men"" are being tried for their roles in raping what are effectively children to confront them.

Recently he was arrested for this citing ""contempt of court"" for doing this what the hell ?? he is to face a trial at CROWN court and will most likely see a custodial sentence....but these gangs of muslim ""men"" opperate with impunity.

A young brave lady called Chelsea in Sunderland was raped and beaten by a gang of syrian migrants, there was a catalogue of evidence but the CPS decided not to press charges against these men ????? How is this justice.

This dramatisation, I hope, will bring a spotlight on these foul pigs, but also on the hypocracy and lack of action by the UK institutions that are supposedly in place to protect us and protect out children.

I have a daughter around the same age as the girls featured in this program, it sickens me to the core."
Three Girls,"Feels like you guys are saying it's not getting it's true due. 

This story is only hazy to us over in N. America and I am curious to know more but I want definitive reporting, if that doesn't sound off base. "
Three Girls,good luck seeing any of this grace /r/worldnews
Three Girls,As long as there is uncertainty about going after the perpetrators it'll continue happening.
Three Girls,"Not to much credit for the BBC went to great lengths to avoid the fact that the perpetrators are not just muslims, every one of them, but that Islam was their motivation for their crime. For under Sharia law they could do anything they wanted to non-muslim girls.  "
Three Girls,"> This show is about the organised and systematic grooming and rape of young white english girls by muslim men (yes muslim I wont be politically correct and say asian or ""pakistani origins"" they are muslims, all of them)

As an exmuslim, I raise my glass to you good sir. 

Fuck these Muslims! Notice I said ""these."""
Three Girls,"People, not pigs. Pigs can be nicer than this. Always remember people do this, whatever gender, to whatever gender.

Always.

Just look after your daughter, don't be overprotective and love her. Be ok."
Three Girls,"> I wont be politically correct

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ESHXxInoAs

Tip, don't mention contemptible scum like Tommy Robinson like he's one of the good guys."
Three Girls,"Tommy Robinson is a tool for ezra levant. He basically wants to do to the muslims what hitler did to the jews. However, what I cannot comprehend is how, how the fuck do law enforcement and social services turn a blind eye to these people. It has to be more then I didn't want to be accused of racism. Given the Manchester attack and the previous attack I really think the English need to reevaluate how effective there government is being run. 
"
Three Girls,"> This story is only hazy to us over in N. America and I am curious to know more but I want definitive reporting

Brit here.  It is without doubt the biggest disgrace in The UK so far in the 20th century.  It boils my blood to think that it happened in the country that i grew up in where people pride themselves in 'fair play'.

Googling 'Rotherham Grooming Scandal' will give you news sources from a lot of perspective but in short Pakistani men between '97- '13 picked up vulnerable girls and passed them around like nothing more than fuck slaves.  The police knew and wouldn't do anything as they didn't want to be labelled as racist, councillors (allegedly) knew about it and did nothing as they didn't want to cause ripples to fuck with their public positions in an area with a high ethnic minority/immigrant population .  On top of that, the 2 women who were sentenced were heads of girls half way houses.

It was a perfect storm of an immigrant culture that sees women, especially white-British girls, as nothing more than expendable fuck pieces.  A police force more worried about self appearance, selfish public servants and straight up corrupt social care workers.  The up shot of this was thousands of victims and permanently fucked up lives.

I'm going to stop typing now because i'm actually mashing keys."
Three Girls,"Way back in 2004 they were covering this up due to political fears. A channel 4 documentary that uncovered child grooming was pulled from the air after police warned it could inflame racial tensions at local election time.

http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/3602854.stm

This has been an issue for decades and is still going on now.

The [Grooming Gang statistics are scary large](http://www.pmclauth.com/sentenced/Grooming-Gang-Statistics/Gangs-Jailed?widget=BASIC&start=1&limit=1000), but no one want to touch it because there is a racial element to them. Also the girls that are targeted normal come from troubled backgrounds and are looked down at by the police. The police don't see a 13/14/15 year old abused child. They see a street wise girl that is just an attention seeking whore."
Three Girls,"Throughout the country, there was this pattern of Asian men (especially of Pakistani descent) grooming teenagers girls (especially white) but the community surrounding them, the police and the media would underreport it due to the fear of seeming racist/xenophobic. [This documentary touches on it and has an interview with the journalist who broke the story](https://youtu.be/Tb2iFikOwYU?t=39m46s)."
Three Girls,"Not sure what you mean. A child is a child. Even if the child consents its still statutory rape.

A quote from 'ThreeGirls' says it best:

> “There’s no such thing as a child prostitute. What there is, is a child who’s been abused”.

This is what the problem is. The authorities blamed the children for socialising with older men. Not the fact that men in their 30's/40's/50's were having underage sex with children as young as 11.

This isn't a two sided case. Having underage sex with children is a crime, even with the childs consent."
Three Girls,"Compared to the kiddies-touchers, he's a saint."
Three Girls,"TBF, Channel 4 have a problem with uncomfortable subject matter, or sensationalising topics, i.e. in advertising and can greatly turn you off."
Three Girls,"But perpetrators can many different things, rich, influential or in this case part of a minority that police are reluctant to prosecute over fears of racial discrimination."
Three Girls,"yup. binge watched it last night, such a heart-wrenching story. like damn, is the british criminal Justice system that fucked up!?"
Three Girls,Thoroughly enjoyed it 
Three Girls,"> is the british criminal Justice system that fucked up!?

How do you mean? The fact they weren't convicted earlier or the court proceedings themselves?"
Three Girls,the fact that they weren't convicted earlier. the fact that the police overlooked the numerous amounts of teenage girls that accused these men of rape. the fact that the older girl (can't remember her name) couldn't go to court because of her 'character'. like wtf man!?
Three Girls,Oh yeah I guess they feared a jury wouldn't believe the older girl (Amber) because of her 'attitude' which basically is sexist. The idea she wasn't a 'worthy' victim I mean which is funny because it was apparently a female prosecutor who don't want to use Amber.  
Three Girls,"Just saw the first episode ... really heart-wrenching.

If I was the father I would have killed and buried everyone of these child-molesters."
Three Girls,Really hard to watch but so good that this is being made. Great performances by all those involved.
Three Girls,Part 2 is up now and covers the police investigation. 
Three Girls,Superstore would have an episode about Jonah trying to negotiate hazard pay for everyone now that they're considered essential workers.
Three Girls,*LOST - Desmond in the Hatch* - absolutely nothing would change
Three Girls,"Grey’s Anatomy - we’re just starting to hear about the epidemic in China. After the new chief of surgery comes back from a business trip to Wuhan, the hospital is on lockdown as multiple patients and staff show symptoms. One of the main characters is giving birth in the stuck elevator. Another main character is showing signs of the disease right after proposing to his fiancée, who was cheating on him with McSomething. The husband of a patient trapped in the hospital forces his way into the hospital with a machete and kills Meredith’s sister. The orthopedic surgeons are as busy as ever, for some reason. That one doctor who was giving birth in an elevator recovers 30 minutes into the episode and finds 30M masks in the nursery and sends them to every hospital on the west coast. Meredith Grey 3D prints ventilators *and* finds a cure. The song How to save a life plays as we see a montage of the consequences of this 24 hours long global pandemic."
Three Girls,"“* *South Park*: The adults would go crazy over toilet paper.”

And Cartman would hoard most of the toilet paper to profiteer from it, until he goes to jail for coughing all over the place.

The Office- Michael would gather everyone in the conference room, no social distancing, while he has a fever and cough, to inform them that Dunder Mifflin is an essential business.

He’d also say that masks don’t work and make his own version of hand sanitizer in the basement utility room with the assistance of Dwight Shrute."
Three Girls,Frazier: Niles would wear an Armani hazmat suit.
Three Girls,FRIENDS - Would take place completely over phone as they stay in their apartments and keep 6 feet apart.
Three Girls,"I want to add to your scrubs one that they'd have one character being really bad about not self isolating and going ""I'm young, I'll be fine"" and then kill a DIFFERENT character out of nowhere.

Edit: 

Jordan - I'll be *fine*, Perry, I'm too young for it to be an issue!  
Dr. Cox - Honey, that may have been true for the *Spanish* Flu but this is a whole new thing!"
Three Girls,Monk would be praised by the people around him for his hygienic lifestyle
Three Girls,"*Parks and Recreation* - Leslie would have a conniption over having to close the parks to help slow the spread, while also having to field inane questions from Pawnee citizens who are terrible at social distncing."
Three Girls,"Seinfeld, they spend first third of the episode discussing the situation at Monk's cafe, then at Jerry's apartment they laugh about quarantine measures. Everyone is close to the easy joke of saying Kramer has been in quarantine for the last 10 years but nobody says it plainly. Seinfeld plans to break the quarantine to go for a date with a germaphobe, George is unemployed due to job cuts, Elaine is jealous Sue Ellen Minsky got coronavirus at a fancy party. I could easily imagine a whole season with it."
Three Girls,The Leftovers - same premise except everybody knows exactly why 2% of the world's population is gone.
Three Girls,"Beavis & Butthead: They'd hear it's a hoax from Tom Anderson then proceed to catch COVID-19 and bring it with them to school while coughing on everybody. And Beavis would keep shouting ""It's a hoax! Heh heh heh heh, it's not real! It's a hoax! Heh heh heh heh."" with Butthead responding ""Huh huh huh, it's a government plot, huh huh huh.""

They'd end up at home in front of the TV just dying and saying it's not real while music videos play.

Daria would probably be the only one to survive."

Bob catches Louise selling masks she made out of paper bags she found in the dumpster.


Linda becomes locally famous for working alone and getting food to essential workers, but ends up not enjoying as much because she wants her whole family to be famous"
Three Girls,"*Family Guy* and *American Dad!* (semi)crossover episode!

On *American Dad!* the CIA unleashes a virus Bullock had the CDC create after reading Stephen King’s ‘The Stand’. The half hour plays out as a parody of the novel complete with Roger as Randall Flagg.

On *Family Guy* the Griffins have to quarantine due to the pandemic and we get a full-on parody of ‘The Shining’ as they’re forced to spend too much time together in closed-quarters."
Three Girls,"But in House, all the hot doctors have to quarantine together and diagnose cases remotely through a lot of sexual tension study scenes."
Three Girls,Where in the World is Carmen San Diego
Three Girls,Sex And The City - the girls would be forced into quarantine with men they’re dating. They quickly realize they all hate each other. Something about not being able to buy shoes.

One of the CSIs is home when the phones go down and they test positive. After a murder happens across the street and unable to call to work, they have to help an agorphone process the crime scene and figure out who the killer is."
Three Girls,"I for one can’t stop thinking about what Larry David is doing during this time, I wish we could have a special episode of Curb Your Enthusiasm just for that."
Three Girls,"I half expect there to be webisodes for some shows that are quarantine themed bottle episodes.

Also most shows are going to have a coronavirus arc in their next season that airs."
Three Girls,Frasier Crane would go even more stir crazy having to spend more time with his dad and Daphne.
Three Girls,"> House would misdiagnose a patient as having something other than COVID-19. 

I'm not buying that one.  House was usually spot on with his (eventual) diagnosis, and the hypotheticals he would initially throw out would not be put in a manner to jeopardize patient or spread disease.

I can't imagine what they would do with ""clinic hours""..."
Three Girls,Corporate would send them Cloud 9 branded masks and gloves.

Three Girls,That's a good one except that Daria would probably take a frying pan to Beavis and Butthead for exacerbating the pandemic.
Three Girls,I know that. I just put it in the list for the easy toilet paper joke.
Three Girls,You... You should be a writer for *Bob's Burgers*.
Three Girls,"Eh, I think TBS would have something to say about putting that kind of episode of *American Dad!* on the air at least for the next year. They're not South Park. They probably won't get a free pass to be distasteful, but that doesn't mean I wouldn't watch it. As for *Family Guy*, I can see any of the Griffins going stir crazy."
Three Girls,No argument from this corner.

Three Girls,"You haven't seen season four then. House put his patients in jeopardy the entire time he ran his stupid game show that awarded a spot on his new team.

""Y'all laughed at me. *Y'all* laughed at me. Well, who's laughing, now?"""
Three Girls,"With all of the animals coming back into cities, Pawnee would see the reemergence of something too. Maybe Pawnee has been devoid of birds since the Sweetums factory moved in, and now the residents are completely startled and scared by the fact that there are flying creatures in the world."
Three Girls,"That's why I stopped watching the show once I was done with the final season. The Pawnee residents are fucking idiots. They are so stupid, that the snotty Christian lady doesn't see that her husband is gay."
Three Girls,"It never was about nothing, they have explained it."
Three Girls,Chronologically lost?
Three Girls,"I'm going to do this with Westworld pretty soon, and maybe finally understand it (I'm holding off on Season 3, so I only have to pay for one month of HBO now)."
Three Girls,"From what I've read, she failed. Someone did print a portal vein, though."
Three Girls,Yes. It's LOST edited in Chronological order. I'd recommend watching only if you have a very good understanding of the show. I can give you the link if you want.
Three Girls,"Yes but 3D printing ventilators is very easy, it’s plastic. A lot of people are currently doing it IRL!"

Larry Charles Dangerous World of Comedy,I just watched “The Rehearsal” last night and loved it! It’s fascinating and has a weird/funny tone.

Larry Charles Dangerous World of Comedy,"Sadly, there isn’t. You can check this website: https://www.justwatch.com/uk/tv-series/the-rehearsal"
Larry Charles Dangerous World of Comedy,Not yet but it is a regular HBO show so it will turn up on Sky at some point. They usually air the smaller shows like this once they wrap their runs.
Larry Charles Dangerous World of Comedy,"His last show, Nathan For You, definitely had moments that were trying to be funny at the expense of others--although it was more common for Nathan to use himself as the butt of a joke. 

In this show (or at least in the first episode that aired last night) the comedy is mostly about the extreme lengths he goes to in order to help someone, and I really can't remember a single moment that felt mean-spirited to me."
Larry Charles Dangerous World of Comedy,He never makes anyone do or say anything. They know they're doing a TV show.  The beauty of the show is that he's getting genuine reactions from people.
Larry Charles Dangerous World of Comedy,"From the description, it sounds awkward as hell. 

> the goal of the show is to help real people prepare for difficult conversations or big life changes by putting them through a practice session with actors posing as loved ones, friends, and bystanders. But as the first season wears on, Fielder, playing a needy and insecure version of himself, becomes as much a part of the rehearsals as the folks he is supposedly assisting, and uses these interactions to reflect on his existential woes

So it's real people, and they're having to deal with someone playing a huge narcissist and making their problems about himself. Yikes."
Larry Charles Dangerous World of Comedy,Its a comedian interacting with real people. So kinda like Borat but a completely different vibe
Larry Charles Dangerous World of Comedy,Yes. Nathan has a script for some parts but the rest is real.
Larry Charles Dangerous World of Comedy,"It’s close to a comedic version of Straight Guy. Real people and real situations, but kind of over the top in a comedic, but not mean spirited way."
Larry Charles Dangerous World of Comedy,You have to watch it. I technically couldn't tell you it's unscripted but it's as blurry a line as it could possibly ever be
Larry Charles Dangerous World of Comedy,It’s like Nathan For You with HBO’s budget and fewer side quests.
Larry Charles Dangerous World of Comedy,"And that's totally ok. I love it, but I also get that it's just not some people's sense of humor."
Larry Charles Dangerous World of Comedy,HBO max

Larry Charles Dangerous World of Comedy,"Most of those, plus the answers given on a walk, and how Nate’s confession at the end about the trivia answers was to the actor he was working with, not the actual person. And it took me a full 10-15 seconds to realize it wasn’t the same guy."
Larry Charles Dangerous World of Comedy,Ty
Larry Charles Dangerous World of Comedy,"I wouldn't hold your breath, How To With John Wilson still hasn't ever been released in the UK nearly two years after its US release"
Larry Charles Dangerous World of Comedy,Agreed. I actually felt like he showed how sympathetic the real people were. I was rooting for them the whole time
Larry Charles Dangerous World of Comedy,That is great to hear.
Larry Charles Dangerous World of Comedy,I appreciate that.  And l know they sign up for it.  I guess it’s just not for me.  I want to see people shine.
Larry Charles Dangerous World of Comedy,Thank you for this.  I don’t know why our comments got downvoted.
Larry Charles Dangerous World of Comedy,Nathan for You also had HBO's budget.
Larry Charles Dangerous World of Comedy,thanks idk why i got downvoted lol
Larry Charles Dangerous World of Comedy,Holy crap! I didn’t notice that.
Larry Charles Dangerous World of Comedy,That show is brilliant.
Larry Charles Dangerous World of Comedy,I wonder if all episodes will be like this. The big lesson will be that we worry about the worst reaction from people for no reason
Larry Charles Dangerous World of Comedy,"Wow my comment hasn't aged well, The Rehearsal comes out in the UK tomorrow"

Kris Straub (creator of the Candle Cove creepypasta) made a webcomic, Broodhollow(unfortunately I think he stopped after book 2), and the YouTube series Local 58, which very much keeps the Candle Cove spirit alive and well .

Larry Charles Dangerous World of Comedy,It was 11 years ago
Larry Charles Dangerous World of Comedy,yt reccomentdations and i didnt know what it was
Larry Charles Dangerous World of Comedy,"As an American, my experience with Channel 4 is that it tends to have more absurd or experimental comedies than the BBC does."
Larry Charles Dangerous World of Comedy,[Local 58](https://youtube.com/c/LOCAL58TV) has some genuinely unsettling content. The first time I saw Contingency was half asleep in the middle of the night. It left me feeling a certain way. Its a shame he hasn't made anything in awhile.
Larry Charles Dangerous World of Comedy,Yeah I'm fucking old.
Larry Charles Dangerous World of Comedy,"Hmm, you ok?"
Larry Charles Dangerous World of Comedy,"It's definitely true, for better or worse. BBC is funded by the TV license so tends to be a bit tamer than the independent channels."
Larry Charles Dangerous World of Comedy,"if /u/somemorestalecontent was 8 when DHMIS came out then he's 20 years old now. I'm 20 too, right? No, wait, I'm 21. I must be 21 because I'm old enough to drink and I do it a lot...But no older.

Surely I'm not already 32, still spending my idle hours on this same social media site, reading about the same viral video content I watched over a decade ago. Were I that old I'd have much money in the bank and an ascendant career, a wife, a family, a house. Not living essentially the same indolent life I lived all those years ago.

Surely that can't be true. I, too, was 8 when it came out. There's no other explanation."

The Umbrella Academy,"Details:

>Mullally and Offerman will be play a mild-mannered married couple named Jean and Gene, who are college professors."
The Umbrella Academy,Ron and Tammy 2 are back.
The Umbrella Academy,Nick Offerman is in EVERYTHING these days. Why has he been hiding for so long after Parks and Rec??
The Umbrella Academy,"“I mean, the deal's not quite closed but let's just pretend it is,"" Mullally said, revealing they start filming ""in a couple of weeks.""

GOAT"
The Umbrella Academy,How the fuck does Megan manage to look half Nick’s age when she’s 12 years older than him?  What the fuck is her skincare routine?
The Umbrella Academy,"I feel sorry for the runners sent to get them out the trailer, lord knows there's going to be some gingerly knocking after the first time"
The Umbrella Academy,"I haven't seen season 3 yet, is it worthwhile?"
The Umbrella Academy,Why does Megan Mullally look so different in this picture?
The Umbrella Academy,Why does he look so yellow
The Umbrella Academy,Love these two. Just saw Nick's performance in the Last of Us. Give that man an award. Well done.
The Umbrella Academy,Tammy 2 is the true world ender.
The Umbrella Academy,They obviously work so well together and I'm excited they will both be in the new Party Down revival.
The Umbrella Academy,IDK if I can watch it. This last season was so convoluted and weird I almost shut it off.
The Umbrella Academy,"I’m hoping this final season gets some more flexibility and freedom after how season 3 clearly suffered from Covid restrictions. 

I’m still annoyed >!they spent so much time in the hotel after wasting the Sparrows. They should have trapped the Sparrows in the hotel as well and turned it into a multi-episode war with them controlling different parts of the building!<."
The Umbrella Academy,This is what I want from a Hollywood power couple!
The Umbrella Academy,That frigid bitch Tammy got her tendrils back in him
The Umbrella Academy,Im assuming him working with Peter Hoar on that last of us episode helped make this happen. Very cool
The Umbrella Academy,"Might want to get that liver checked, Nick. Or fire your makeup artist."
The Umbrella Academy,Both of them are always value added. Very cool news.
The Umbrella Academy,That will be fun.
The Umbrella Academy,Is Nick’s liver okay? Hard to tell if he is yellow or the contrast of the red hair is throwing me off.
The Umbrella Academy,Someone’s had some work done
The Umbrella Academy,Do they offer a 2 for 1 deal
The Umbrella Academy,Does he look jaundice to you?
The Umbrella Academy,Hell yes
The Umbrella Academy,Shit is about to get weird
The Umbrella Academy,I feel like this is gonna be a great addition.
The Umbrella Academy,Fuck my pooper I’m so happy
The Umbrella Academy,Cool!
The Umbrella Academy,"What the hell, that’s awesome"
The Umbrella Academy,He and Frank are both dead.. how can he be in that?
The Umbrella Academy,Well.. I wasn’t expecting that but I’m in!
The Umbrella Academy,No idea what that is. I’ll watch it now.
The Umbrella Academy,These two would be awesome to hang out with.
The Umbrella Academy,"I love both of them, they’re hilarious !"
The Umbrella Academy,Yessssss!
The Umbrella Academy,Shit! How the hell was season 3 not the end? There was nothing left.
The Umbrella Academy,I thought it ended?
The Umbrella Academy,"Awesome. 

And what an awesome couple. 😁👍🏼"
The Umbrella Academy,"Damn, I cannot wait to see their chemistry on cam as a married couple."
The Umbrella Academy,Cool!
The Umbrella Academy,This is the best news I’ve seen all week
The Umbrella Academy,They are trying very hard to get people to watch it again
The Umbrella Academy,How this show made it past season 1 episode 1 is beyond me. I truly despised this atrocity of a show.
The Umbrella Academy,YEEEEEEES AWESOME!!!
The Umbrella Academy,Shows dead
The Umbrella Academy,Aww man they dragged those two into that mess?
The Umbrella Academy,They won’t be enough to save it
The Umbrella Academy,There’s going to be another season? Why?
The Umbrella Academy,Woke Academy
The Umbrella Academy,[removed]
The Umbrella Academy,"these two actually dated at one point, just an FYI"
The Umbrella Academy,"She comes across as a bit of an airhead with her “like”, “you know”, “hello!”, “great, great, great…”.  

And I’d be saying the same thing about him if it applied."
The Umbrella Academy,Can we make sure the end of the world isn’t because of five’s powers? Boring the second time around.
The Umbrella Academy,Wow!
The Umbrella Academy,Absolute units of talent these two
The Umbrella Academy,I have such a crush on both of them but I think just a little bit more on Nick
The Umbrella Academy,"Ack, I thought this was a divorce announcement when I saw the photo!!! 😰"
The Umbrella Academy,Nick Offerman supremacy
The Umbrella Academy,I’m always stoked to see these 2 in a project together! Their chemistry is unmatched!
The Umbrella Academy,I love that these two come as a package
The Umbrella Academy,He is not longer Ron Swanson to me.   He is Bill Swanson.
The Umbrella Academy,Suddenly interested again.
The Umbrella Academy,Oh yes please!
The Umbrella Academy,Nick Offerman is literally in everything these days. Pretty wild!
The Umbrella Academy,The contemporary Offerman resurgence (or just continued upward trajectory perhaps?) has been awesome. Dude is surprisingly dynamic and I’ve yet to see him in anything where he didn’t improve the quality of the show/movie with his performance.
The Umbrella Academy,“As themselves”
The Umbrella Academy,[deleted]
The Umbrella Academy,Last of us
The Umbrella Academy,Fuck well now I have to finish watching the last season. Ugh.
The Umbrella Academy,That show is so original.. and awesome 👏
The Umbrella Academy,Yessssss!!!
The Umbrella Academy,This show had so much potential… season one was great and imo it went downhill after that. Hoping season 4 does a good job of tying up loose ends.
The Umbrella Academy,"Looking at that table read photo, it never connected in my head that Tom Hopper wasn't that huge in real life. He's a svelte dude!"
The Umbrella Academy,"Yes!!!
Can’t wait."
The Umbrella Academy,Nice! I'm excited to see more Nick Offerman after his great performance in The Last of Us episode.
The Umbrella Academy,Offerman staying booked and busy.
The Umbrella Academy,"Glad for them, but I’m glad this is the final season. I like the show, but it’s so draining."
The Umbrella Academy,"Great, great show"
The Umbrella Academy,Never forget that she’s 64!!!!! Wow
The Umbrella Academy,Shit now I gotta watch just for Nick
The Umbrella Academy,"Is it just me, or has Nick Offerman been increasingly present in movies, tv, etc lately? He’s always had work, but I feel like he’s busier…?"
The Umbrella Academy,I LOVE NICK OFFERMAN!!!!!!
The Umbrella Academy,Karen Walker approves of this message.
The Umbrella Academy,"All I know about the show is that I watched it and liked it. I have no idea what’s going on plotwise. Yes, I’ll watch the next season. No, I won’t understand it."
The Umbrella Academy,Looks like liver failure
The Umbrella Academy,But which ones gonna be which? Guess we gotta tune in to find out!
The Umbrella Academy,i feel like its the crazy stuff of the show and their names being Jean and Gene but it makes me think of the Lutece twins from Bioshock Infinite.  Not really twins they are the same person in parallel universe
The Umbrella Academy,What's it like to stare in the eye of Satan's butt hole?
The Umbrella Academy,Gene Parmesian!
The Umbrella Academy,"My grandparents were Gene and Jean (technically my granny is still Jean, she's still alive). Eugene and Jean, but they went by Gene and Jean.

My mother was first born, named Eugenia. Her brother? Eugene. 

I'm serious, it's an old, running joke. If they joke about ""having good genes/jeans"" in TUA, I'll spit."
The Umbrella Academy,"Huh, I was expecting he'd be Doctor Terminal. But considering how far this show has strayed from the source material, I guess anything goes."
The Umbrella Academy,Of course they will be!
The Umbrella Academy,One of my sister's first husband's parents were named HeGene and SheJean.
The Umbrella Academy,“I didn’t shave it off.  It rubbed off.  From friction.”
The Umbrella Academy,If they're not violently making out in every scene I'm not watching.
The Umbrella Academy,Ron as a woodworking professor and Tammy the college librarian.
The Umbrella Academy,Her evil cackling is something that hits so close to life. I know a Tammy in real life and she is 5150 for sure.
The Umbrella Academy,Glad it’s not Tammy 1
The Umbrella Academy,"He has been in lots of stuff but I don't think a ton of it made it into the zeitgeist. He hosted that crafting show, Making It, with his co-host Amy Poehler. My favorite thing he did was Devs, which was very good but its release got overshadowed a bit by the start of COVID and everybody watching Tiger King instead."
Natsumes Book of Friends,"I don't suppose you could add a brief few sentences/words selling us on the series and why they're worth a watch and what makes them special? To me, I just see a laundry list of titles and genres honestly. 

Knowing the animation studio and year released is pretty much meaningless for knowing the quality of character development and plot depth."

Land of the Lustrous  
Mawaru Penguindrum

Natsumes Book of Friends,"> Blood Blockade Battlefront

I was confused for a second there, then realized thats the English name for Kekkai Sensen."
Natsumes Book of Friends,"Konosuba definitely should be on here for it's hilarious subversion, wherein everyone seems nice but are terrible people"
Natsumes Book of Friends,My Hero Academia is also really excellent.
Natsumes Book of Friends,"I think you can also add Megalo Box to this list. While the ending wasn't as good, rest of the show was still great, and might actually suit most of the audience here. The old school animation and design, etc. "
Natsumes Book of Friends,"Next time I would include Animes that would appeal to Western Taste. Most of these will not be appealing for the general audience. 

Some good animes for the Western Taste (2010s only):

One-Punch Man (Action/Comedy. An overpowered dude that is a hero for fun).


My Hero Academica (Action/Coming of Age story. A weak powerless boy gets the most powerful superpower in the world and his tale to master this power without breaking everything in his body using it.)


Psycho Pass (Thriller/Crime. Dystopian Future where police kills everyone who has a hint of mental instability)

Parasyte (Thriller/Horror. Dude gets infected by an alien parasite but the infection doesn't go as planned.)

Edit: Forgot to add that these all have English Dubs. Most of the list above do not.
"
Natsumes Book of Friends,"Gundam: Iron Blooded Orphans
Is a great one, its serious, the animation looks great, it does get dark because it deals with children piloting the mechs"
Natsumes Book of Friends,"First, thank you putting this list together and trying to offer more exposure to an entire medium/format/genre (Japanese animation) that is, imo, underappreciated in the west. Now, on to a few thoughts/opinions:

When people actually ask for recommendations, it's best not to overwhelm them with options else they might feel overwhelmed and give up. If they get a response of ""Evangelion, Cowboy Bebop, Samurai Champloo, Death Note"" then they already have ~100 hours of watching ahead of them and those are totally fine options. 

There's a lot of comedy and slice of life on this list. While more variety sounds better on paper, I don't think those genres work as well as others with a language/culture barrier. They're usually more character focused and thus body language, dialog, inflection, dialect, translation, nuance, delivery, inside jokes, locality, animation style, etc. become more important. The usual Cowboy Bebop recommendations are generally more serious, conceptual, sci-fi, psychological, seinen, action, mystery -type series that show off what ""adult"" animation is capable of which result in more ""wow!"" experiences (and western media ""borrowing"" from them). The unfortunate ""anime stigma"" in the west is that anime is perverted and characters look/act like 12yo children (which westerners already have in the form of youth-targeted cartoons). So, while I personally really enjoy something like Kill La Kill, I don't think the over-the-top action, ridiculous plot, and easily misinterpreted sexualization would be a good starting point/leave a good first impression for the uninitiated. 

This list is great for those who have already watched most of the popular recommendations for westerners and want to branch out a bit more. That said, new fans should keep in mind that they'll probably dislike 95% of all anime produced. I've watched 300+ series and I wouldn't go anywhere near some of the stuff on this list. And that's OK; it's common with most hobbies/interests. Find what you like, look for more, have fun with it, share your experiences!

For reference, my favorite TV (top 10, random order):

* Breaking Bad/Better Call Saul
* Game of Thrones
* Westworld
* Black Mirror
* Lost
* The Wire

Natsumes Book of Friends,Panty & Stocking with Garterbelt
Natsumes Book of Friends,"I was kinda hoping you would list [Uchuu Kyoudai](https://myanimelist.net/anime/12431/Uchuu_Kyoudai ) or Space Brothers in English.  Pretty good slice of life/sci fi about becoming an Astronaut.   Here is the [trailer with English sub for it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciS3fDqT1Vw )

Another series maybe not considered in the past decade is [Hajime No Ippo](https://myanimelist.net/anime/263/Hajime_no_Ippo ) even though the 3rd season (Hajime No Ippo: Rising) came out in 2013/2014.  Its a great sport/slice of life/comedy series."
Natsumes Book of Friends,Needs more Jojo
Natsumes Book of Friends,"i like cowboy bebop, ghost in the shell, FMA, samurai champloo

basically anime that does not rely on anime troupes and tells a great story, what would you recommend from this decade?

edit: action oriented is a plus"
Natsumes Book of Friends,I'd like to throw a shout for Terror in Resonance too. Great show
Natsumes Book of Friends,"Barakamon and Girls' Last Tour are two of my absolute favorite shows, and I'm pretty happy to see them make the list. Sora no Woto is up there too.

Those three are all slice-of-life type shows, a genre that can be pretty hit or miss, but these three do a great job of building a world (or a town, as in Barakamon) and making you keep watching because you're interested in that world, and the characters, even if there's no overreaching plot trying to tie everything together. They aren't necessarily exciting, but they're thoroughly enjoyable. And sometimes you just need a nice calm show like that."
Natsumes Book of Friends,Kind of a weird post. I'd expect at least a sorry description with each show. A genre doesn't really cut it.
Natsumes Book of Friends,"**Sora no Woto** is surprisingly good. Definitely not what I expected. It's part slice of life, part post-apocalypse, and also an anti-war story. And the music is fantastic. Occasionally feels like **Kino's Journey**, but somwhat less bleak. 

***
**Showa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu** is a slow burn, but is an exceptionally good period drama set in the post-postwar era where the Japanese economy was beginning to pick up again. One of the popular forms of entertainment was a style of traditonal comic storytelling called Rakugo. In an era where not many had televisions yet, they were often broadcast on radio. 

A recently released convict approaches one of the masters of this artform to become his disciple after having only heard his radio broadcasts in prison. Drama ensues. Lots of dialogue as you may expect. **Joshiraku** is a much less serious take on Rakugo, if you like terrible puns and Japanese cultural references you won't understand, this is for you. 

***
**Natsume's Book of Friends** is really one of the most heartbreaking yet heartwarming series I've ever seen. Main character is the only person who can see the denizens of the spirit world, resulting in him being ostracised by almost every human he meets due to his reaction to heir presence, but returning to his grandmother's hometown changes that, for better or worse. Partly episodic, but with some overarching plot. For another contemporary fantasy series that's kind of similar, try **The Ancient Magus' Bride**. **Mushishi** is also excellent and has a similar spirit detective vibe, but much more serious. "
Natsumes Book of Friends,Didn't see Steins Gate on here..... Better than 90% 0f the things listed 
Natsumes Book of Friends,"My Hero Academia and Assassination Classroom are noticeably not present :o  
I personally fuckin loved AC, I know it's not everyone's cup of tea, but I found it wholesome and touching"
Natsumes Book of Friends,Madoka magica ! 
Natsumes Book of Friends,"I’m not a huge anime fan. But I watched Erased recently... good lord that’s a fantastic show. Cool plot, good characters, good mystery. Plays on a fantasy I think a lot of people have at least once in their life. And there’s only one season. They got in, told their story, and got out."
Natsumes Book of Friends,"Thank you so much, OP, for this! I haven't watched much of anime since my college days, and I have lost track of what's what. Thank you for the recommendations, definitely going to save this post."

I can recommend darling in the franxx."
Natsumes Book of Friends,"If you are looking for slow burn anime's that don't have your typical Japanese pervy tropes, watch Mushishi and Monster. Masterpieces imo."
Natsumes Book of Friends,"Blood Blockade Battlefront, Mob Psycho, and Made in Abyss are all in my top 10 anime. Very solid shows. "

in the vein of Mirrai Nikki, Madoka Magica, Shinsekai yori"
Natsumes Book of Friends,"My anime background is just the classics and most well known (DragonBall, Naruto, Bleach). Right now my only base for anime is Netflix. I've watched Attack on Titan, Tokyo Ghoul, Full Metal Alchemist Brotherhood, Sinbad, Death Note and One Punch Man, and currently I started watching Sword Art Online. 

Do you recommend it? Based on my viewing history and the Netflix catalogue what would you recommend I watch next?"
Natsumes Book of Friends,I would say you’re missing Jojo’s Bizarre Adventure. Besides being awesome it’s a cultural touchstone in Anime that is constantly referenced and parodied. I would argue it’s a must watch show
Natsumes Book of Friends,"\>K-On!  


My. Fucking. Man. The best taste."
Natsumes Book of Friends,"Devilman crybaby is also a good anime, gory , but good."
Natsumes Book of Friends,Add in wotakoi: love is hard for an otaku. It's a really good romance comedy that deals with adults instead of the regular HS ones
Natsumes Book of Friends,No love for Welcome to the N.H.K.?
Natsumes Book of Friends,"I'm someone who haven't watched a lot of anime since about 2008 or so, so I'll check out some of these, thanks. 

That said, I feel like the medium has definitely changed a lot since that time. So many shows now have either very strange animation styles (Kill la Kill, Made in Abyss, Devilman Crybaby...) or these strange formulaic stock characters everywhere (at least I don't remember people talking about tsunderes and moes and I don't know what back in the day). I'm sure there's a lot of good stuff once you get past these things, but in most cases nowadays I don't get further than some weirdass synopsis before I sigh and re-watch Black Lagoon or Claymore instead. And I'm someone who, despite not immersing myself into the anime/""weabo"" culture, has after all read and watched quite a lot of manga and anime in my time, and someone who likes 'weird' stuff Evangelion or Gantz.

I think that's the reason why Attack on Titan has been such a hit here in the West, despite imho not being that good of a show (it seems to go for repeated 'shocks' over telling an engaging story). It has a pretty 'realistic' and good looking animation style, characters that for the most part look rather normal, and though the premise is a bit strange it's very straight-forward once it gets going."
Natsumes Book of Friends,"Recently saw Made in Abyss because a lot of people have been raving about it.

The main characters are a girl of 14, and a robot that looks like a boy of about the same age.

I would like it a lot more, if there were not shit like recurring ""jokes"" where people look down the robot boys pants and exclaim that he has a penis. 

Like often when people were recommending it, I'd see em specify that it was not for children, and I kinda assumed that was because of horror elements or something. Like god dammit Japan."
Natsumes Book of Friends,"Ummm...My Hero Academia?

It's an amazing shonen series with much better pacing, animation and characters than a lot of its contemporaries."
Natsumes Book of Friends,"Another one I’d absolutely recommend if you’re looking for a more light hearted/comedic take on anime is “The Devil is a Part Timer”. 

Really funny, great story and quick watch. Premise is pretty simple, Devil comes back to earth and tries to take over the world...by working in fast food. 

If I’m not mistaken it’s still on Netflix, highly highly recommend."
Natsumes Book of Friends,Parastye -the maxim- should 100% be on this list. 
Natsumes Book of Friends,"I'm gonna use this thread to mention that, yes, One Piece has over 800 episodes, but it is probably the most pure fun that you can find while still managing to be epic, emotional and engaging. "
Natsumes Book of Friends,"Your lie in april. 

Shokugeki no soma 

Nanatsu no taizai"
Natsumes Book of Friends,I'll martyr myself and list Tokyo Ghoul. I guess it's become pretty 'normie' but i still really enjoyed it. Also The Lost Village was a pretty neat short one.
Natsumes Book of Friends,I recognized so few animes in that list. Feel like you're missing a TON.
Natsumes Book of Friends,"Damn. When you realize all of the super popular anime you liked as a kid aren’t part of this decade lol 

Old. "
Natsumes Book of Friends,Does crunchyroll or funimation offer offline/download & play yet? That's been my biggest obstacle to consuming anime.
Natsumes Book of Friends,Black Clover?
Natsumes Book of Friends,.
Natsumes Book of Friends,I would recommend Made in Abyss. Only one season and it's already one of my favorites.
Natsumes Book of Friends,Beast Player Erin (Kemono no Sōja) is a really good one that I never hear anyone mention.
Natsumes Book of Friends,"Pretty good list, though I'd add Higurashi (the official stuff, essentially seasons 1 and 2.) for how damn good it was it combining the slice of life with horror, especially the more psychological aspects. Umineko is different, but good just somewhat odd at times and feels better to read than merely watch. 
"
Natsumes Book of Friends,"Baki 2018. Absolutely brutal fighting. If you are squeamish do not watch. It is metal as hell though, I love it.


I could probably recommend some others but I'll leave it at that."
Natsumes Book of Friends,[deleted]
Natsumes Book of Friends,"Don't forget to request to get new seasons of your favorite anime:

https://help.netflix.com/en/titlerequest"
Natsumes Book of Friends,"I've only ever watched one anime in my adult life and that's Attack on Titan. I really enjoyed it but I'm fine not watching anything else. I have some personal hang ups about anime being ""for kids"", even the one tailored for mature audiences. "
Natsumes Book of Friends,"Not only are these shows that fall out of the ""Same 10 anime"" thing. They're all shows that I can see actually getting people into anime. Shows like FMA:B and Death Note are shows that feel detached enough for people to think ""I'm not too sure about anime, but Fullmetal Alchemist is pretty good"" instead of ""hey maybe I like anime"". All of these shows (at least the ones I've seen) are both great and feel like anime. Good list.


I also want to boost March Comes in Like a Lion to anyone reading this. It's one of my favorite shows. It follows a 17 year old depressed professional Shogi player who just recently started living on his own. Over the course of the series you watch him open up to people and form a familiar relationship that he's never really had in his life. You don't need to know anything about Shogi to understand the show."
Natsumes Book of Friends,"I'd like to think that Shouwa Genjou Rakugo Shinju is the pinnacle of anime in recent years. THE series that towers above the rest. It's not my favourite series for sure, but it comes incredibly close to perfection in so many ways. I doubt I'd recommend it to someone new to anime, but there's no excuse for anyone who calls themselves an avid fan of anime to not watch Rakugo. 

And then there's Ping Pong... The things I would give to see another series of this caliber. I'm so glad to see it on your list."
Natsumes Book of Friends,All are pretty good except Yuru Camp and Flip Flappers
Natsumes Book of Friends,"Kobayashi's Dragon Maid is probably the first new-ish anime I've fully watched in years, since Bodacious Space Pirates and Jormungand. It's poignant, cute, a little... creepy... but still heartily recommended."
Natsumes Book of Friends,"I was never an Anime fan.  I remember enjoying Ninja Scroll back in the 90's, but that's about it.  Then one day 'Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress' popped up on Amazon Prime, and I clicked on it, because there was nothing else to watch.  Loved it.  As soon as I finished it, I wanted to see even more.  Attack on Titan was a recommendation I've heard over and over, so I started watching it next.  It was even better than the Iron Fortress.  The animation, the soundtrack, the story - they were all just perfect, and I couldn't wait for more.

While waiting for the next season, I was eager to see all the other great anime shows I've been missing out on.  But here's where the disappointment came.  I would check dozens of the top recommended shows, and they simply weren't my cup of tea.  Either the animation was looking like something made in the 80's, or the story was just meh.  I could barely watch one episode, before giving up in the search of the next Attack on Titan. 

It all made sense, when I found out both Attack on Titan, and Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress are made by the same studio.  I have yet to find any other anime show that comes close to those two.  And this is not me shitting on other shows.  I'm sure they're great, but they just don't do it for me.  There's just something about AoT or KotIF, whether it's the awesome visuals, or soundtrack, that put them in a league of their own."
Natsumes Book of Friends,"No sword art online season 1?

What's the point?


Jk (though I do like SAO)

Great list op thanks for sharing"
Natsumes Book of Friends,"Maybe doesn't *technically* count, but 48% of Gintama (and potentially more, maybe, hopefully) has come after your cutoff date, and imo Gintama is a legendary anime. Action/comedy, has survived multiple hiatuses, and has reportedly been more profitable than Bleach or Naruto in Western countries, made even more incredible due to its lack of an English dub or mainstream viewing channel (such as Cartoon Network's Toonami). Insane amounts of fun, and I'm incredibly sad to be seeing it go."
Natsumes Book of Friends,[deleted]
Natsumes Book of Friends,"Totally expected, but still dissapointed that there's no Yu-Gi-Oh. :p  
Just fits well with my personal taste.  
  
My favorite beyond that though is the old anime Ranma ½. Although the manga has better plots and characterization, love the animation, voices and music. :D"
Natsumes Book of Friends,"Look at you making a worthless list that doesn't include whether there is a dub, which makes it awful, and by extension you awful."
Natsumes Book of Friends,"Oh! I can do a brief rundown of all of them. Give me a few minutes and I'll be back with a few words about each.  


EDIT: OKAY! Here we go.

**Barakamon:** brash young calligrapher gets exiled to the boonies to find himself

**Blood Blockade Battlefront:** secret society of supers fight weird monsters in wacky New York

**Cells at Work:** Osmosis Jones but with a cute redhead as the lead instead of Chris Rock

**Chihayafuru:** Sports show about a poetry card game. Cooler than it sounds.

**Death Parade:** Bar in purgatory hosts games to judge souls’ fates

**The Eccentric Family:** An eccentric family of shapeshifters go about their lives

**Erased:** Time travel murder mystery where the time travel isn’t that big of a deal. Tearjerker.

**Flip Flappers:** I literally cannot describe it beyond “two magical girls and trippy world”

**Flying Witch:** Extremely relaxing show about a witch training in the countryside

**Girls’ Last Tour:** Two girls journey across a harsh post apocalyptic wasteland. Philosophy?

**Haikyuu:** Hot guys play volleyball. Character development.

**Hyouka:** Bored high schoolers solve boring mysteries. Show is anything but boring.

**K-On:** Cute high school girls play in a band and eat cake. Super comfy.

**Katanagatari:** Finding swords? Weird art style. Weirder dialogue.

**Kids on the Slope:** Realistic jazz coming of age in the 60s. Great music.

**Kill la Kill:** Skimpy lingerie battles at fascist high school. Way better than it sounds.

**Kyousogiga:** Similarly trippy, often confusing show about multidimensional family. Fantastic.

**Land of the Lustrous:** One of the few 3D CGI anime worth your time. About gem people, but not the Steven Universe kind.

**Little Witch Academia:** Harry Potter.

**Love, Chuunibyou, and Other Delusions:** Cute middle schoolers do things? Haven’t seen it.

**Lupin III:** Classic, classy thief steals riches and hearts. Got Miyazaki his start.

**Made in Abyss:** Don’t go exploring the big scary hole, kids. Don’t.\\

**March comes in like a Lion:** Drama about a chess prodigy and his relationships. One of the best. 

**Mawaru Penguindrum:** Brothers and penguins(?) try to help their sister. Haven’t seen it.

**Miss Kobayashi:** Fun, funny show about a woman who adopts a bunch of dragon people into her life

**Mob Psycho 100:** Cool, trippy, great action show about a kid with super psychic powers

**Monthly Girls’ Nozaki Kun:** High school girl’s crush on romance manga artist goes unnoticed; she becomes his assistant in this wacky, hilarious comedy about romance.

**My Teen Romantic Comedy SNAFU:** Catcher in the Rye if it were anime and there were three Holdens. Very good.

**Mushishi:** Cool-ass spirit detective does spirit detective shit

**Nagi no Asukara:** Very pretty show about water people(?) Haven’t seen it.

**Natsume’s Book of Friends:** Arguably the closest you’ll get to a Ghibli TV show. Guy has spirit friends.

**Nichijou:** Wacky sketch comedy about wacky insane people. Very good.

**Noragami:** Haven’t seen it …. a fallen god is trying to get back on his feet(?)

**Ore Monogatari:** Gentle giant falls in love with pint sized classmate. Adorable as fuck.

**Ping Pong the Animation:** Guys play ping pong, learn about themselves. Looks wacky. Is fantastic.

**A Place Further than the Universe:** Girls go to Antarctica. Sweet and touching show.

**Polar Bear Cafe:** Polar bears and other animals run a cafe (?) Haven’t seen it.

**Shinsekai Yori:** WORLDBUILDING. New generation of humans trying to figure out about themselves(?)

**Shirobako:** An anime show about making anime shows. It’s incredible, heartwarming and educational.

**Showa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu:** Stand up comedy but it’s sit-down comedy and it’s very old fashioned. Character drama about artists in a dying medium in the 60s, 70s, 80s, and beyond. Slow burn that’s easily one of the best shows of the last few years, anime or no.

**So Ra No Wo To:** Girls in a small brigade run an army corps of musicians. Also they have a tank? There’s more to it but I can’t remember.

**Sound Euphonium:** High school concert band, and all the character drama and shenanigans that go with it. Very good.

**Space Dandy:** About a dandy guy in space. Lots of sexual humor. From the guy who made Cowboy Bebop. 

**Tamako Market:** Girl living in a market district has fun shenanigans with friends. Warm and comfy. The talking bird grows on you. Oh, also there’s a dark-skinned prince who shows up.

**Tanaka kun is Always Restless:** haven’t seen this one -- it’s about a guy who’s always lazy. But supposedly it’s very good.

**Tatami Galaxy:** Very fast dialogue, weird visuals. About a guy figuring out his life in college. Once you get the hang of it, it’s very entertaining and relatable.

**Tsuki ga Kirei:** Adorable show about middle schoolers’ first love.

**Tsuritama:** Haven’t seen it. IIRC there’s a guy who’s like a mermaid? Comedy, I think.

**Usagi Drop:** Relaxing, sweet show about a bachelor who takes in his grandfather’s six year old daughter from an affair. 

**Violet Evergarden:** Gorgeous show about PTSD and a young woman who becomes a letter writer in a semi 1930s world. Don’t go in expecting an action show. 

**Yona of the Dawn:** Semi-historical action adventure about a princess and her crew who go rogue.

**Yuru Camp:** Comfy show about high schoolers camping. Will make you want to camp."
Natsumes Book of Friends,[deleted]
Natsumes Book of Friends,"Nichijou, Ping Pong the Animation, Sound! Euphonium, Kyousougiga, and A Place Further than the Universe are my next biggest recommendations.

Also, I actually almost didn't include Noragami, as I had some problems with the 1st season, but damn was Noragami Aragoto amazing. It's everything I love about battle shounen (a genre I'm not really a fan of) but without the filler. Too bad we'll never get a 3rd season."
Natsumes Book of Friends,"Haha yeah i decided to use english names unless it's so uncommon. I've seen a fair amount of people online refer to kekkai sensen by the english name, so i went with that. In contrast, I've literally never heard anyone call Nagi no Asukara by the english name: A Lull in the Sea."
Natsumes Book of Friends,"Agreed. One could make an argument that it's the anime equivalent to It's Always Sunny. 

Not me obvious, but someone else could."
Natsumes Book of Friends,"Watched it but didn't find it quite as funny as others. Then again, I actually like Isekai as a genre (I know some dismiss it) and would probably have recommended Overlord at least. Honorable mentions to Re:Zero, Death March, and even Knights & Magic IMO though I know that last one is held up by many as an example of what is wrong with Isekai shows. "
Natsumes Book of Friends,"It's so popular I feel the OP decided it didn't need another shout out.

But yeah, it's a pretty good show."
Natsumes Book of Friends,"It just annoys me how none of the heroes ever die.

Kills the suspense everytime they battle these villains who are more experienced and powerful than them."
Natsumes Book of Friends,Watching that show only makes me pine for OPM that much more. 
Natsumes Book of Friends,I feel it's just a copy of Naruto. 
Natsumes Book of Friends,How does it compare in tone/style etc to Hajime no Ippo? Definitely loving the idea of another boxing anime.
Natsumes Book of Friends,"Oh right, I should get around to watching that."
Natsumes Book of Friends,"Parasyte is really good, Imagine Japanese Peter Parker turned into venom before he ever became spider-man, and takes the responsibility to make sure to the best of his ability that humans and alien body snatchers are able to co exist secretly without everyone dying. 

"
Natsumes Book of Friends,I dunno those first two are the sort of over-recommended shows that the OP was trying to avoid. 
Natsumes Book of Friends,"> Next time I would include Animes that would appeal to Western Taste

Baccano!"
Natsumes Book of Friends,Psycho Pass season one is AMAZING
Natsumes Book of Friends,Pretty sure OP was going for non-generic picks.
Natsumes Book of Friends,"OPM, MHA and Psycho Pass are such cliche recommendations. They're good but defeat the whole purpose of this list. 

This whole ""Western Taste"" nonsense is so exaggerated "
Natsumes Book of Friends,"-	imo One Punch Man wore its premise thin pretty quickly
-	I guess I kinda liked My Hero Academia, but that's about it.
-	Psycho Pass sits just right outside my list because of the disappointing 2nd season.
-	I have to give it to you for Parasyte tho. Great show that I somehow forgot while making this list. Not sure which one it would replace tho (probably Kill la Kill or Tanaka-kun is Always Listless)"
Natsumes Book of Friends,I'd throw in Berserk and Hunter x Hunter and then call it a day.
Natsumes Book of Friends,"Do they get all emo and decide to defeat their enemies through power of love/friendship/telepathy/whatever?

Because I am watching Gundam Unicorn and it's abysmal. Especially since I watched Gundam 8th MS Team, Thunderbolt and Origins before this one and those seemed way superior even though Unicorn is supposed to be some hot stuff.

I mean, where did all that emo/telepathy stuff come from all of a sudden?  

"
Natsumes Book of Friends,"My taste overlaps with you quite a bit on live action. I couldn't get into Black Lagoon or Gurren Lagann, but I'll try to give Ergo Proxy, Steins;Gate, Psycho-Pass, and Ghost in the Shell a shot.

Thanks!"
Natsumes Book of Friends,This show was hilarious
Natsumes Book of Friends,I will never forgive Gainax for what they did in the finale. God fucking damn it. I'm pissed years later.
Natsumes Book of Friends,"Damnit how did i forget about this show? If I had to replace a show on my list with Space Brothers, it'd probably be Kill la Kill or Death Parade."
Natsumes Book of Friends,Agreed. Every anime fan needs more Jojo!
Natsumes Book of Friends,"Since you've seem Cowboy Bebop and Samurai Champloo, the logical next step is to see Space Dandy made by the same director. Where Cowboy Bebop was jazz and Samurai Champloo was hip hop, Space Dandy is disco/funk. It's also a lot weirder than the other two, but in a good way."
Natsumes Book of Friends,"My main recs would be Showa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu and Ping Pong the Animation. You could also maybe try Death Parade, Erased, Katanagatari, Natsume's Book of Friends, Shinsekai Yori, and The Tatami Galaxy."
Natsumes Book of Friends,"It's from the 90s but it basically takes the cake when it comes to throwing anime tropes on their head: Neon Genesis Evangelion.  Giant robots fighting giant... ""monsters"" plus depression."
Natsumes Book of Friends,"A little late but I would recommend these. parasyte, banana fish, Durarara, psycho pass, and dororo which is airing me but is very good."
Natsumes Book of Friends,"Watch kids on the slope, same person who did bebop Anh champloo"
Natsumes Book of Friends,Agreed. One of the best shows I’ve seen tbh.
The Kirlian Frequency,"Samurai jack. It was aired on cartoon network for 4 seasons but then it got cancelled possibly due creative differences. But , in 2017, the creator did season 5 not on CN but on Adult Swim and ended perfectly."
The Kirlian Frequency,Star Wars the clone wars
The Kirlian Frequency,"Farscape.

The show ended with the two main characters getting engaged to be married. Then, an alien ship flew in out of nowhere and ""killed"" them. (Blasted them with something that broke them into pieces which fell into the boat they were in as well as into the water.)

Fan outrage over the cancellation was enough that the creators were given a miniseries to tie up loose ends. It wasn't perfect. They basically had 3 seasons of plot sketched out that they needed to compress into the equivalent of 4 episodes. Still, it was much better than getting nothing and the ending tied up enough while still leaving the possibility of future adventures open."
The Kirlian Frequency,I do wish a lot of Netflix series got a conclusion even if it was through another source. Netflix series could easily fill this list if somebody else got the rights
The Kirlian Frequency,Firefly.
The Kirlian Frequency,"Even though Community got a conclusion, it technically counts in this category since they are finally doing the movie."
The Kirlian Frequency,"Veronica Mars.
A movie thanks to fans and Kickstarter. And later a new season. The movie is beloved, I choose to ignore the new season."
The Kirlian Frequency,My Name Is Earl had a news headline read on the tv the Chances were watching on Raising Hope that wrapped up Earl's story.
The Kirlian Frequency,"Futurama.

The show's original run ended. However, it did so well on DVD and in reruns that Comedy Central ordered four movies to be split into another season. This got us more seasons and a few finales. 

Bonus: It's being revived again!"
The Kirlian Frequency,Jericho
The Kirlian Frequency,Both XFiles spin off shows got tied up in episodes of the XFiles
The Kirlian Frequency,Stargate SG-1 got 2 movies to tie up 2 of the main storylines.
The Kirlian Frequency,"Batman Beyond.  In the Justice League Unlimited episode Epilogue, Terry gets some much deserved closure, not to mention that awesome scene with Batman and Ace."
The Kirlian Frequency,Dead Like Me
The Kirlian Frequency,"Party Down, new season next month"
The Kirlian Frequency,Reaper: https://cliqueclack.com/tv/2010/02/01/how-reaper-would-have-ended-straight-from-the-creators/
The Kirlian Frequency,Ray Donovan had a movie that wrapped up all the loose ends from the final episode.
The Kirlian Frequency,"NBC 's The Pretender got 2 TNT TV movies, but it did not conclude things. Sorry to mention the opposite of what you asked."
The Kirlian Frequency,My Name is Earl got a conclusion in the form of news report about Earl completing his list on Greg Garcia's next show Raising Hope
The Kirlian Frequency,Farscape.
The Kirlian Frequency,Las Vegas left on a cliffhanger that got resolved on the first episode of the Knight Rider remake.
The Kirlian Frequency,Psych
The Kirlian Frequency,It was dope to have seen Rockos modern life and Invader Zim years after their original runs had ended but they were definitely a product of their time
The Kirlian Frequency,"Breaking bad wasn't cancelled, but I love what they did with El Camino to give Jesse a satisfying conclusion"
The Kirlian Frequency,Hey Arnold
The Kirlian Frequency,The Last Kingdom is getting a movie
The Kirlian Frequency,Did anyone mention Alien Nation? Several TV movies a few years after the show was cancelled.
The Kirlian Frequency,Saved by the Bell  the college years got cancelled and the following year there was the tv movie Saved by the Bell Wedding in Las Vegas
The Kirlian Frequency,"Zoey's Extraordinary Playlist got a surprise Christmas movie to wrap up all the plot points.

Middleman got a comic book adaptation of the planned season finale that was never made."
The Kirlian Frequency,"The Dark Crystal did it in reverse. Got its conclusion, then a TV show that was cancelled for no good reason."
The Kirlian Frequency,"Carnivale. Not completely, but the creator released a 30-40 page document that gave a lot of character background/story that provided some resolution and direction for where every character and storyline was going."
The Kirlian Frequency,"Not a conclusion but a key piece of information was revealed about The Sopranos in The Many Saints of Newark and even though the movie was extremely mid, I appreciated the reveal."
The Kirlian Frequency,Nightcourt got it's conclusion on 30 rock.
The Kirlian Frequency,"Shadowhunters: The Mortal Instruments, it was announced to be cancelled but they also ordered 2 more episodes to wrap it up. I can't remember now if they announced the cancellation and 2 eps at the same time but they aired the final season then the last two aired back to back the next week."
The Kirlian Frequency,"Little House on the Prairie was cancelled, apparently they didn’t even tell the cast and crew officially they all found out when the show wasn’t listed in the fall lineup. 

They were given 3 tv specials after that, in the last one they blow up the town."
The Kirlian Frequency,"Cannot believe no one has mentioned the original Star Trek.

EDIT: Some people are saying it doesn't count b/c there were no cliffhangers or unresolved thread. But OP never said a series had to have those things in their original post. Star Trek TOS was canceled, then revived and given a stronger conclusion. It meets that standard.

Serialized TV was a rarity in the 60s and its not reasonable to hold a show from that time to the standard of having a strong story arc throughout."
The Kirlian Frequency,"\- Two X-Files spin-offs had conclusions on The X-Files itself

\- Sabrina had a conclusion on Riverdale"
The Kirlian Frequency,"My 3 favorites (mentioned by others):

* Firefly/Serenity
* Farscape
* Deadwood"
The Kirlian Frequency,unfortunately...NOT GLOW
The Kirlian Frequency,"ALF

There was supposed to be a season 5 to explain the cliffhanger on season 4.  The execs had a verbal agreement with the ALF producers to resolve the cliffhanger.  Thus the movie Project: ALF five years later."
The Kirlian Frequency,"The IT Crowd.

After 4 seasons, they had a special hour long episode ending it."
The Kirlian Frequency,Dexter
The Kirlian Frequency,Firefly got Serenity
The Kirlian Frequency,Dead like me…. But the movie sucked and it didn’t feel like it concluded the story.
The Kirlian Frequency,Both Avatars on Nickelodeon have comics that continue the story
The Kirlian Frequency,"Technically cancelled again but Tuca and Bertie. Season 1 did poorly on Netflix, Adult Swim picked it up and it ran for two seasons."
The Kirlian Frequency,"Firefly/Serenity
Stargate SG-1/Ark of Truth"
The Kirlian Frequency,"Defying Gravity (2009)

Astronauts on a mysterious mission that involved visiting every planet in the solar system. Got cancelled halfway through the first season so the head writer went on a fan forum and have the outline for how the story would have gone including the big secret."
The Kirlian Frequency,The Comeback
The Kirlian Frequency,You said it.... Deadwood
The Kirlian Frequency,"Samurai Jack got one

Inuyasha got a final season

The Expanse and Community both look like they will get continuations in Movie form. (Community is more confirmed, while the Expanse Creators keep hinting at it heavily)

Hey Arnold, Invader Zim, and Rocko's Modern Life all got wrap up movies years after.

Adventure time got a Wrap Up miniseries on HBO Max. (That last episode was depressing)

Breaking Bad got its movie...but dont know how much you can count it with Better Call Saul existing."
The Kirlian Frequency,Star Wars the clone wars cartoon. The last 4 episodes are personally some of the greatest Star Wars content ever released
The Kirlian Frequency,Firefly got a movie called Serenity
The Kirlian Frequency,Community is getting a movie… right?
The Kirlian Frequency,Zoeys extraordinary playlist. It got a Christmas movie to wrap up the Max getting powers angle.
The Kirlian Frequency,IIRC Chuck got canceled in one form or another after almost EVERY season they released. It was a miracle that we got 5 seasons by the end.
The Kirlian Frequency,"It wasn’t cancelled, but Seinfeld got a cool follow-up mini-episode on “Curb Your Enthusiasm.”"
The Kirlian Frequency,"Breaking Bad got two _additional_ conclusions, even though it had a very strong conclusion on its own.  El Camino and (parts of) Better Call Saul gave us conclusions to Jesse’s and Saul’s arc respectively."
The Kirlian Frequency,Invader Zim
The Kirlian Frequency,"Ray Donovan.  Watching it now, so I don't know how the series end, and how the movie was, but I know they made it specifically because it didn't have an actual ending."
The Kirlian Frequency,"Looking (2014-16) got a movie as well. 
Amazing underrated series."
The Kirlian Frequency,"Dead Like Me. Great show, terrible movie."
The Kirlian Frequency,Las Vegas. I remember it ending on a cliffhanger and a friend told me that the characters showed up on another show to casually answer what happened (might've been a show that they did a crossover with).
The Kirlian Frequency,"Firefly also got a movie, Serenity. 

Amazing."
The Kirlian Frequency,"Gilligan’s Island 
Gilmore Girls"
The Kirlian Frequency,Firefly!
The Kirlian Frequency,Frequency got a wrap up short? Link please?
The Kirlian Frequency,Farscape
The Kirlian Frequency,Twin Peaks still is left opened enough for another season if they want to explore another season in the next few years.
The Kirlian Frequency,The clone wars
The Kirlian Frequency,"Back in 2006 to like 2008 there was a show called Las Vegas. Ended on a cliff hanger of home girl maybe losing her baby. Another show had a quick cameo oh her, her husband and child all safe."
The Kirlian Frequency,Farscape. Got a four-hour miniseries conclusion.
The Kirlian Frequency,"It got an early enough heads-up from the network for the crew to put together what could be considered a conclusion in Season 2, but you can probably see in the last few episodes of “Dollhouse” what would have been their plan for the show had it gone on a few more years."
The Kirlian Frequency,"Farscape got the Peacekeeper Wars. Not the conclusion we were hoping for, but better than nothing."
The Kirlian Frequency,Looking got a movie.
The Kirlian Frequency,"No Tomorrow released a little wrap up video online the day after it ended

American Dreams filmed a scene wrapping up the series if they got cancelled, but ABC didn’t run it because of the cost of the music rights. They finally got to run it several years ago at a tv festival, about a decade after the show ended."
The Kirlian Frequency,Brooklyn 99 was cancelled by fox. Cult following and outcry allowed them to get picked up by NBC for another couple of seasons
The Kirlian Frequency,Firefly
The Kirlian Frequency,"Firefly and Serenity.

The funny thing is I actually ended up watching Serenity first and then realized it was based on the canceled tv series. Went back and watched Firefly and was devastated when I heard all the drama around it. What a truly spectacular verse that just got thrown away."
The Kirlian Frequency,The creators of Haven wrote what would have happened if they got a sixth season.
The Kirlian Frequency,"Jericho. 

They finished the story in comic books. Was pretty good"
The Kirlian Frequency,"Revolution.

Such a great show (not in the first few episodes tho) but got cancelled after second season and then got a conclusion with a few comics.

I only wished other shows like Terra Nova and Flashforward would have had an ending with comics or something like that..."
The Kirlian Frequency,"Firefly got Serentity.

Farscape got a finale."
The Kirlian Frequency,"Star Trek: Enterprise got a book series that essentially rewrote the ending, and then covered what Season 5 would have."
The Kirlian Frequency,"Manifest. 

It’s still being concluded with the final season in Netflix.

This show didn’t get exactly canceled but the tv show Chuck. It was on the verge of getting cancelled until the fans put up a campaign with the help of Subway to help renew the show."
The Kirlian Frequency,Smallville had a comic book continuation where Clark became superman and met other heroes like Batman
The Kirlian Frequency,Looking got a movie. October Road filmed a twenty minute finale with the cast and had it as a DVD extra.
The Kirlian Frequency,Farscape got The Peacekeeper War
The Kirlian Frequency,Firefly got a movie that sort of had a story conclusion.
The Kirlian Frequency,"Blue Mountain State got a movie, and they knew exactly who to center it around thank God. Rise if Thadland is goofy but a cathartic experience if you just need a little less blue in your state."
The Kirlian Frequency,The expanse
The Kirlian Frequency,Farscape.
The Kirlian Frequency,"Ed, Edd, and Eddy"
The Kirlian Frequency,Stargate SG-1 got 2 movies
The Kirlian Frequency,"A rather obscure one that half fits your criteria:

A Disney Channel show called So Weird had its lead actress leave after season 2 to pursue other endeavors. Since she was the main, the ENTIRE last season had to change. It was probably going to change anyway due to the darker nature of the scripts, but with the main’s departure it was set in stone.

The writers went online and outlined the plans for the original last season.

It was already planning for three seasons so after the third it was quietly cancelled."
The Kirlian Frequency,"Stargate SG-1 got two movies *Stargate: The Ark of Truth* and *Stargate: Continuum*, each concluding a different storyline."
The Kirlian Frequency,The Pretender and Far Scape come to mind. They both got canceled but had movies to finish up the stories.
The Kirlian Frequency,"Todd and the Book of Pure Evil. Such an amazing, silly, funny show with a talented cast.  Canceled after season two on a cliffhanger but was brought to conclusion with an animated movie a few years later. NSFW and tons of juvenile humor."
The Kirlian Frequency,Young justice has a comic series called young justice targets. I enjoy it and it’s got really good/ decent reviews. I think young justice really improves when the art is so distractingly ass.
The Kirlian Frequency,Arrested Development got lousy sequels on Netflix before getting cancelled again lol
The 43,"In Plain Sight's Mary Shannon played by Mary McCormack should have been on this list. A fantastic and powerful character.

The 43,Anna Torv was just the most horrible actress in an otherwise amazing show.
The 43,"I loved watching This Old House from the 80s.

Norm is amazing. Never seen him fuck up a job."
The 43,Just something different about pbs shows that make them so relaxing and easy to watch. His was one of them
The 43,Best home improvement show ever.
The 43,The god of the American woodworker.
The 43,Wear your safety glasses as tribute.
The 43,I’ll be watching and recording this. Used to watch This Old House and New Yankee Workshop with my dad all the time. Still watch episodes of TOH now. Norm is a legend.
The 43,"The problem with Norm and This Old House is that they’re all really skilled at what they do so that everything looks too easy. I watch an episode and say, yeah I can totally retile my bathroom. I cannot."
The 43,"Time makes fools of us all, doesn't it? Not sure why this hits so hard to, but damn, end of an era."
The 43,"If i had a channel of just this and ""How It's Made"" episodes that'd be just fine"
The 43,Bring back God Damn Yankee Workshop!!!
The 43,"His middle name is Fuckin.  Maybe it isn’t actually, but he IS Norm Fuckin Abram to me.  When home improvement shows were less about entertainment and the big reveal - and more about learning new things!"
The 43,"I remember this as a kid in the UK because I'd go to visit the grandparents and my grandad would be watching this and the New Yankee Workshop on Sky, back when it was satellite TV rather than digital."
The 43,"Yes to this. I used to watch this show with my Dad a lot as a kid. We would also watch ‘Huell Howser’s California’s Gold’ often, I feel like it was on the same channel around that time… good memories and reminders of how old I’m getting :)"
The 43,"I loved watching this show religiously during the weekend. Can’t remember if it was Saturday or Sunday, either way I love the way Norm was in the show, watched until he left, such a good show that made you feel there were good people out there trying to create/build something with respect of what came before. Hope he is enjoying retirement."
The 43,God bless him. Great guy
The 43,"Norm was the contractor on the first This Old House season. Richard Trethewey was the son of the plumber but he did appear, so now Rich is the longest serving member of the team. Rich's son Ross appears on Ask This Old House but Rich doesn't look to be slowing down anytime soon."
The 43,"Anyone else remember him on ""Freakazoid""?"
The 43,They essentially formed the foundation for HGTV and all the renovation/decorating shows!
The 43,"I hope they got a really good editor for this documentary

You know, the kind that measures twice but only cuts once"
The 43,"Bob Villa and Norm Abram are pretty well etched into my childhood. LeVar Burton/Reading Rainbow, Mr. Rogers, Sesame Street, and This Old House.

We only had like 4 channels."
The 43,Does someone have a download of this episode?
The 43,"Saw this in time to set a timer, thanks!"
The 43,Just watched it and wanted to post it. Top notch!
The 43,Oh snap gotta put this one my calendar! My husband and I have religiously watched This Old House and Ask! for years on Sunday mornings lol
The 43,Norm! The uncle who wasn’t related to you!
The 43,Watching (usually against my will) New Yankee Workshop with my dad in Saturday evenings is a core memory of my childhood
The 43,Every affiliate seems to be showing this some other day or time.
The 43,Still watch the show.  Love when they are fixing up a Cape Cod..  I love how the younger guy always gets yelled at by the new old guy on the show.
The 43,Am Canadian but I grew up watching This Old House and New Yankee Workshop back in the day. I love Norm Abrams. He's the Mr Rogers of woodworking.
The 43,Guessing those bits got cut out.  But I bet it was exceedingly rare.
The 43,"He’s awesome. Just a decent dude who’s good at his job. No drama, no BS."
The 43,"My wife and I (old folks) watched This Old House in the 80s. One day, as I was doing some project, she asked ""Why does Norm never say 'Aw F*ck!' like you do?"""
The 43,I remember seeing him with his hand bandaged on one episode.  But coming from a family of wood-workers that is to be expected.
The 43,Lack of agenda or sensationalism
The 43,Norm and Roy Underhill always made for a nice relaxing rainy Saturday
The 43,My morning ritual is usually making my coffee and putting on the block of cooking shows PBS has on every morning.
The 43,Their YouTube channel is incredible as well. Perfect little 4-8 minute videos on how to do pretty much everything in your home with no fluffy shit or begging for subscribers. Just pure uncomplicated information.
The 43,"Nothing compares. Anything you watch on HGTV is just filled with stupid drama, awful editing, and literally no educational content. And while the owner renovation budgets on TOH are *substantial*, they are realistic because the people in the show are architects, lawyers, etc. 

""I'm a barista and my boyfriend is a dog walker, and our budget is $1.5 million!"""
The 43,"The New Yankee workshop, that was my Jam!!"
The 43,I also used to watch New Yankee Workshop with my dad all the time. He was a hobby woodworker himself. I have a lot of good memories of those mornings we watched together.
The 43,But they give a lot of good information and tips so that you have some idea of what to do when you get started. You’re not completely in the dark. Everyone starts bad. No one starts as an expert.
The 43,Don't you just smear the spackle down and fit the tiles in? That doesn't sound too hard... In theory.
The 43,Just saw the Norm special tonight. Got a few tears in my eyes now.  I'm going to miss this guy I've seen nearly every week for 40 years
The 43,"If you have a roku, I believe there’s a 24/7 This Old House channel"
The 43,Add New Yankee Workshop to the lineup and I'll subscribe!
The 43,Throw in Myth Busters and it is perfect.
The 43,Sky is only now starting to transition from satellite to IPTV.
The 43,Throw in On the Road With Charles Kuralt with that mix. I guess that wasn’t PBS but still sweet stuff.
The 43,"They do.  I met Tommy once and talked a bit about Norm and his skill.  At some point he said ""I've seen Norm miss a cut.""  He wasn't dissing Norm, but letting me know the guy was still human. :)"
The 43,"I was thinking about the list of good TV people (Mr Rogers, Bob Ross, Steve Irwin) the other day, and thinking Norm Abrams probably deserves a place on that list."
The 43,"Oh, man. You brought back memories of my grandfather. He would string together ten curses words into one continuous word when something 
went wrong on a project. It was pretty impressive how filthy he could get!"
The 43,"> And while the owner renovation budgets on TOH are substantial, they are realistic because the people in the show are architects, lawyers, etc.

Just to be the wet blanket of factual reality, no, TOH is not ""realistic"".  The budgets are massive, and even the incredibly affluent homeowners have decidedly *unrealistic* buying power afforded by the massively subsidized and sponsored labor and materials.

Would anyone here embark on a renovation and then magically have the funds to install a skyscraper foundation under their house, or windows that exceed the home's previous total value?  Nope.

For decades I've wished This Old House would become This Realistic Old House, where owners would have to make real world choices instead of somehow going for every extravagant option possible, with zero compromises ever."
The 43,PORTER CABLE!!!!
The 43,"Uh, they have *two* of them, actually! Haha."
The 43,Same on Samsung TV
The 43,"Huh, I thought everyone went digital back around the time I did in 2003."
The 43,"Steve Irwin wasn't ""one of the good people"".

He tormented animals for money under the guise of a zoo-owning ""animal lover"".  

Unfortunately the Reddit demographic watched him during their most impressionable childhood years and they idolize him inappropriately.  

He even died doing what he loved: tormenting an animal for camera footage.  He's no different than prize hunters who say sure I needlessly murder animals for fun but maybe a bit of my money indirectly goes back down the chain to animals, somewhere.  

Meanwhile, millions are wrongly programmed that someone who constantly jumps on animals' spines to wrestle them or provokes snakes to strike a camera lens is ""good"".

Oh but he died, so we can't speak truthfully about how he acquired his fame and wealth."
The 43,"Fair points all around, I must admit. It's not realistic, but the educational aspect is still there.

Ask This Old House is much more of a DIY-er's friend, as they have step-by-step educational content.

I have noticed throughout the years that they never talk about any sort of budget. They do talk about how some options for things are more expensive than others.

I think the most modest renovation was the Detroit series where they remodeled an abandoned house."
The 43,Sky transitioned to digital satellite 1998-2001
The 43,"Item costs and budgets *do* come up from time to time, but it's superficial and perplexing.  Like, they'll pose some dilemma about how structural improvement has to be weighed against nicer floors... and in the end they'll somehow go for the most platinum and diamond-encrusted versions of *both*.  How?!  Or they'll talk about doing an attic as a option and then a subsequent episode they'll be building it with super expensive lvls and perfect dimension engineered members instead of basic framing material.  Has anyone ever *not* had wall to wall hardwood on every floor?  Or skipped the high velocity ultra-expensive retrofit air conditioning?  Re-used a boiler?  Not chosen the futuristic heat pumps and multistage water treatment and filtration systems, or the solar panel augmented surge-proof electric panels?  Tubs and tiles will always be the ones that cost 10x regular.  Sometimes they'll talk about homeowners doing ""sweat equity"" but it consists of some quick and cheap task like carrying old insulation batts to the dumpster, things that would never save any significant amount of money.  Or the family will say they'll do some skilled task to save money, but Tom Dasilva just comes in and does it for/with them.  

Then in the final episode, budget concerns are mocked away as the interior furnishings are easily six figures plus.  No General Electric appliances in sight, just Wolf and Sub Zero.  Sofas and beds that cost $10k+.  84 inch TVs and high end fireplaces, bbqs, laundries, copper gutters and composite decking as far as the eye can see, with manicured landscaping.  Window coverings worth easy $30k, walking past custom closet organizers that also cost thousands each.

Anyone who has ever done real renovations knows that by the end you're lucky to have any sheckels to get some ikea towels, and your beautiful built in cabinet is holding your old thick ass house brand tv because you spent your contingency and variance on the twenty unexpected or overpriced reno complications that arise.

There's some where they do charity cases but there's always the show budget and insurance/flood/FEMA funds that seem to be sloshing around."
The 43,"Stop ruining my image of TOH! haha. 

I also notice they use the same contractors. Either Tom Silva's brother's company, or Sweenor builders. So I can *certainly* imagine that the show is used as a constant advertisement to the super wealthy of New England who are looking to remodel or build new construction homes."
The 43,"Well I'm not knocking it, just pointing out it's luxury renovation, not realistic or modest."
The 43,"Not surprising. He hasn’t been as active on the series as he used to be. Going forward, I’m not even sure they need someone as intrinsically linked to the show as he was. A regular host is nice but not essential. 

It’s still a decent series though. I hope it continues on for years to come"
The 43,"The David Suzuki Foundation started a fun thing in 2012 called “30x30”. It was to encourage people to spend at least 30 minutes in nature every day for 30 days in May. I might be the only one still officially doing it, but I have done it every year since."
The 43,"Dang, as a kid the only channel I was allowed unlimited viewing time on was the local PBS affiliate, and ""The Nature of Things"" and Nova were highlights on a Tuesday night."
The 43,"Thanks, David. I wouldn’t be as Canadian as I am without you."
The 43,"He was very popular in Australia. Saw him give a few lectures. 

Too bad we didn’t listen to him when we had the time."
The 43,"Met the dude in Whistler and he was running on a treadmill. 

Dude is or was JACKED"
The 43,I’m 43 and Canadian. He was a childhood hero
The 43,Good. He’s not what a lot of people think he is.
The 43,"He just wants to follow his grandnephew around. We would do the same, David, we sure would"
The 43,I used to sleep with a girl who had a David Suzuki pillow on her bed. He will be missed.
The 43,Saw the first part of the title and almost had a heart attack thinking he had passed. Stepping down is the end of an era but he’s done his part.
The 43,One of the few hosts from my youth that were still out there. Salud!
The 43,Why tho
The 43,"What’s the nature of that, David Suzuki?"
The 43,What a loss
The 43,Neva seen
The 43,"I expect a ""The National"" type situation where they have a handful of different hosts all with different leads for stories."
The 43,[deleted]
The 43,That's a cute idea!!
The 43,He is.  The first time I saw a pic of him shirtless in his 80s I thought it was a photoshop job. He’s shredded!
The 43,[deleted]
The 43,He’s actually two kids in a trench coat.
The 43,What is he
The 43,The man is almost 90. I think he is allowed to retire now.
The 43,"Haha, I recently left Instagram, but I posted a picture of my adventures every day in May for the last 9 years. I figure I’ll do it one more time to round out a decade of 30x30."
The 43,I met him on JohnSt.  He stopped in the middle of traffic just to give my friend his autograph.  Seemed pretty cool to me.
The 43,A clone who was replaced years ago after he died I bet
The 43,"Elitist hypocrite who owns multiple homes/mansions, travels by private planes, and is generally regarded rude and petty. He has the personal carbon foot print equivalent to a European micro state."
The 43,Fuck. I stopped at episode 4 of 1899 to wait for my lazy friend. Guess I’m part of the problem.
The 43,"Very much this, but there’s another big factor being weighed: cost of production. 

This applies directly to the Heartstopper vs First Kill comparison, which became a trending social media conversation over the summer because both were LGBT shows with substantial audience overlap. Heartstopper had a high completion rate AND was cheap to make; First Kill had a low completion rate and was much more expensive due to CGI/action. Add that Heartstopper was lauded by critics (and has gone on to win Emmys and other awards), and First Kill was panned, and it was an obvious choice to renew the cheap show and cancel the expensive one.

There’s a lot of discussion about shows needing to be mega-hits in order to succeed, but that’s really only the case for high-budget shows. Cowboy Bebop was cancelled because it was quite expensive and didn’t reach mega-hit status. Stranger Things endures despite being quite expensive only because it’s such a phenomenon. If it was even somewhat less of one, it wouldn’t have lasted.

Netflix’s brand could certainly benefit from the PR of giving shows a little more of a chance, but currently they’re not really being any more cancel-happy than TV has ever been. They do have reasons based on data, most of which we don’t see."
The 43,"We Mean It This Time, This Is The Final Straw For Netflix

--/r/television, again"
The 43,I dropped 1899 about halfway through so I guess this one's on me.
The 43,"It makes sense. If most people in a restaurant left potatoes on the plate but are still hungry, you don't tell the chef to cook more potatoes."
The 43,This is probably why most traditional networks don’t put out all their good shit at once
The 43,"This is the kind of posts we need, than the xyz user saying for the 1000th a critically acclaimed show is underrated"
The 43,"If you still want to know more about what goes on behind the scenes at these companies, this interview was really interesting.

Dating Around,"The white 'New Yorker' from episode 2 who kept on bragging about how much of a New Yorker he is, gave me all the creeps. He made his ex,  who he didn't commit to even after two years of dating and living together lose her cat. Man come on!! He was so fucking arrogant. The way he spoke about himself like, ' I ain't gonna lose to a cat' made me want to punch right in his asshole face. He verbally attacked Gurki for no fault of her own and walked right out. "
Dating Around,"\*\*spoiler\*\*\*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I felt so bad for the Indian girl who had to deal with the crazy whit guy who felt the need to attack her for literally no reason, absolutely insane. Sarah from episode 5 gave me the creeps, I went out with a girl whom I later realized was most definitely a narcissistic  sociopath, Sarah had the same predator-like stare in her eyes and clearly putting on a façade. I think the guy realized hence why he dipped right away. The older guy going on dates was so precious, but what the hell was up with that women who said she cheated on her husband who had a stroke and that it was a good thing because it made him ""appreciate her"", then went onto try and fish compliments out of Leonard. It was weird watching it because you can tell its not scripted, and for me it made the red flags in certain people pop out even more."
Dating Around,Some of this is so damn cringy. 
Dating Around,"I binged it this morning, really enjoyed it. If you like this try First Dates UK, it's just as genuine. "
Dating Around,I love this show so much!!! 
Dating Around,"Personally, I think a great reality show is one where the cameras are more discrete and don't encourage people to not be themselves. First Dates > Dating Around."
Dating Around,"Dude I love this show. Is there a subreddit for it? Also, EPISODE 2 SPOILERS: I didn’t understand the ending, did she pick no one? "
Dating Around,yeah that luke is not as handsome as he thinks he is or the girls were scripted to say 
Dating Around,The indian girl fight with Justin started when the Indian girl disagreed with his love philosophy. Then she said he doesn't know love. It was like a back and forth poking but she didn't realise Justin had already stored multiple ammunition to fire at her already. 
Dating Around,"I couldn't believe he compared himself to a cat???? Like seriously??? Your masculinity is threatened by a cat or what? His ex shouldn't have dumped the cat, but him to the trash bin . "
Dating Around,episode 5 is probably the hardest to watch.
Dating Around,"I'm based in the UK and really enjoy First Dates. Having just watched the first two episodes of Dating Around, whilst they are okay and I'll watch the rest, I don't think they're as good because of how they are filmed."
Dating Around,"Yes, I believe she chose no one and decided to treat herself and go shopping."
Dating Around,">The indian girl fight with Justin started when the Indian girl disagreed with his love philosophy. Then she said he doesn't know love. It was like a back and forth poking but she didn't realise Justin had already stored multiple ammunition to fire at her already.

Least you could do is to remember her name – Gurki "
Dating Around,"Honestly first dates U.K. Is one of my favorite shows ever!!! I live in Canada and it makes me want to visit the UK. I watch every episode with the biggest dumb grin on my face and then usually end up crying at one point. I love it, it's so genuine. "
Dating Around,"I can’t believe she liked his bland ass, but that’ll be a poor 2.5 years of their lives that I’ve seen so many times. It works because I’m dating someone like her and that 26-29ish relationship is what brings some good perspective on not settling for emotionally dead blandness.  Which he was. He had literally no personality and could only chuckle uncomfortably at her making any joke.  

Unclear why they made this episode 1 unless it’s just to hook people in their 30s who sigh with relief. He was the worst.  

People in your 20s, your 30s are going to be better."
Dating Around,"That lady from Jersey was so trashy, I couldn’t watch her eat. "
Dating Around,"Luke is pretty boring, but I'll give him props for going through 6 dates.  I thought they were all terrible"
Dating Around,Haven't watched it but it sounds almost the same as a show called First Dates that's in the UK. Usually one of the people on the date is extreme cringe.
Dating Around,"Yeah, I really enjoyed the other episodes actually. The only thing that could have made Luke’s episode worse is if he picked any of the other three. "
Dating Around,"Yes, he seemed a little dull sometimes, but not extremely so for what's supposed to be a real person."
Dating Around,"You can tell she dates nothing but NFl Jersey, baseball cap wearing d-bags"
Dating Around,He’s the worst.
Dating Around,Is this article serious?  Love is blind is a junkyard of trash.  I love it.
Dating Around,The circle? That was also trash
Dating Around,Why?
Dating Around,"Wasn’t as good as the original UK version. By having fewer episodes, you didn’t get to know the contestants and it just seemed like an endless carrousel of forgettable characters. Original format was brilliant."
Dating Around,The surrealism of dating was perfectly captured in Man Seeking Woman which was tragically taken from us too soon.
Dating Around,He found his woman. It reached I pretty natural stopping point I would say. 
Dating Around,"It had a fine ending, but it was still cancelled. They seemingly had plans for it to continue. It could have just evolved into the relationship aspect, but it was cancelled."
Dating Around,I prefer Horsin' Around.
Dating Around,Having them go on 5 dates is a smart choice for storytelling. It'll garner long-term investment from viewers.
Dating Around,"I'm kind of a sucker for reality trash like this- but something is off about this. The camera angles feel all too.. perfect. Like it's really hard to believe that this is ""real"" when everyone is talking like they're going off of a script.

Obviously this is the trailer and they probably only showcase the most well-spoken bits, but still."
Dating Around,This feels like a commercial for a new online dating service.
Dating Around,"I prefer Knifin Around

https://youtu.be/YZNkz1V5ahU"
Dating Around,"It's funny you say that, because I've felt that with almost every Netflix reality show. I'm so used to basic cable reality shows and how they feel like ""the norm"", but Netflix does something different that I just can't put my finger on. It almost seems like they try to film them like a documentary. I've also heard that Netflix originals are required to be filmed with 4K cameras, which I don't think any other reality show uses."
Dating Around,"I don't like the way the shows end.

There needs to be like a 30 second talk/wrap-up from the ""dater"" so we have some clues/insight as to why they made their decision. "
Dating Around,"I like it this way. It's not usual for a reality, but it's actually realer like that, as you are not able to extract clues/insight from people in an interview in real life. Things just happen and we move on.

I get your point of view, though."
Dating Around,"I get your point of view, too.

It's particularly bad though when they have a show like the 2nd one with the girl (think her name was Gurkey), where she picks no one, and we have no closure as to why.  "
Dating Around,So many people say You is a guilty pleasure.  Personally I don't feel an ounce of guilt for really enjoying this show.  Just finished season 4 tonight and loved it.  Joe is pure plot armor but honestly I really just don't fucking care.  Stab away Joe.  I'm with you till the end buddy.
Dating Around,Joe is the the textbook definition of plot armor. There must be no good lawyers in the you-verse if he’s able to successfully frame so many people
Dating Around,First time?
Dating Around,did you not pay attention to the part where Joe said he wanted Marianne to be found. so her daughter would have closure?
Dating Around,"The writers don't understand Joe's character but you do. 
It's always been you.
You're the only one who understands Joe."
Dating Around,"I think this is You's worst season. The whole murder-mystery vibe of the first 5 eps was just okay, but none of those formed into a cohesive ending as the ""killer"" just ""revealed himself by the end of ep 5. None of Joe's investigating has come to a cohesive thought.

With the benefit of hindsight, of course this isn't what really happens (talking about who the killer really is, ep 6 above). But all of the runtime investigating who the eat-the-rich killer was wasted and almost the entire 5 eps felt like they were almost all for nothing. 

Aside from that, the first 5 eps had a weird vibe. I think the writers wanted to change things up, but the generic murder-mystery vibe of the first half made You lose it's identity. It was never like that for the past 3 years.

The 2nd half felt worse. It's almost 5 eps of joe just fighting his inner demon (you-know-who), and the plot just felt like it was pondering up until the 10th ep. I absolutely loved the last half of ep 10 though. The plot twist has been a number of times so it wasn't really a shocker or a game-changer, and it really slowed the pacing down."
Dating Around,"I dropped this show after they decided to kill Love and just start the cycle all over again. It was a nice guilty pleasure, but I’m done. The best part of S3 was the brief moments where Joe and Love worked together.

Did they bring Mariane back? Such a dull character when compared to his previous love interests. I couldn’t stand his infatuation with her in S3. I was like, ffs, just focus on Joe and Love."
Dating Around,"Killing Joe was Plan A, faking her death was Plan B. They probably hoped that Joe would leave her in public because a) He still cared about her (even by the end of Season 2 Joe had fallen out of love with Love) and b) Marienne didn’t want her daughter to have hope that she would return, and she knows they share a history of abandonment and living in foster care.

Their plan was risky and bonkers but it makes sense that she was paranoid. Her ex-husband had just conveniently died, Love told her to run from Joe, then Joe “dies” in a murder-suicide that everyone thinks was committed by Love, he follows her across an ocean, chases her, lets her go, then kidnaps her and locks her in a glass cage.

The split-personality thing was odd but I feel it can still be rationalized. Joe thinks bad stuff just happens to him or that he just *needs* to do bad stuff. Splitting Joe into Joe and “Rhys” allows “Rhys” (and making Joe unaware) to do all the brutal, impulsive stuff he’s always had inside of him, while Joe is the rational person left to clean up the mess. When Joe and “Rhys” are forced to work together then we get back to normal Joe: dark yet meticulous.

As for Tom, he was probably thinking about killing two birds with one stone. He has Joe get rid of Rhys and then uses that to get rid of Joe."
Dating Around,"I think you're applying too much real world logic to the show. It's a silly murder comedy drama, not a documentary."
Dating Around,I this season 4 was the best season. It was dumb mindless drama. Yeah lot of plot of armor but it’s popcorn tv just set back and enjoy it.
Dating Around,Also would he not watch the news to see if they found her body?
Dating Around,"I'm going to agree with A LOT of what you said. Hands down the worst season. It didn't get good or interesting until episode 9!! 🤦🏼‍♀️ The whole ""Eat the Rich"" drama was over the top. None of the characters were good. Over the top, bad acting and hey who cares. Zero investment. Yes in season 2 & 3 there were over the top characters but the writing and acting brought them to life. Forty! Loved him! Sherry and Cary! Hysterical! There's no saving the ""Eat the Rich"" crew! No depth and uuuggghhhh so poorly portrayed.

Was taking that storyline sooooo far worth the payoff at the end! Not sure! 9 episodes were wasted. And really why oh why wouldn't Nadia call the police immediately when she found Marianne. And run like hell when she saw Joe!.🤦🏼‍♀️🤦🏼‍♀️🤦🏼‍♀️"
Dating Around,[deleted]
Dating Around,"This show is not going for awards. It knows what it wants and executed on it. I love it. I just started, “Your Honor”. The judge is every bit of fuck up like Walter White was. It’s cringey, but I’m sure they know this."
Dating Around,The blackmailing to kill rhys made no sense because it implied Kate’s dad knew rhys has something on joe. In reality rhys doesn’t know who tf joe is
Dating Around,What I don’t get is now Joe has multiple personality disorder? Lol it would make sense if that was the case since season 1
Dating Around,"I'm just starting to watch season 4. I love the quasi Hercule Poirot whodunit with a established group of suspects in a modern, but traditional English setting. There was even a nod to Agatha Christie in the library! I hope there are more seasons set in Europe.

Binge watched it. Talented writing. Excellent."
Dating Around,"  
I thought that idea of ""tricking the murderer"" was crazy. The show's reasoning was that he would honor Marianne's wishes and put her where anyone can find her, but who's to say that he actually does that? He could have buried her alive and the plan would have failed. Also the friend was not worried that her friend had not showed up for months on end? I don't buy it.   
  
Also, the whole not calling the cop thing, made not logical sense. Oh well he's going to come after me. Well not if Nadia has images of the ""trophies"" and actually shows the cops where exactly it is. He can be traced back to California and New York. This will be enough information for a full on investigation to take place. The cops are going to have to listen to the couple (black woman and white man) from the previous season. they can confirm that he had them locked in there. This will exonerate the Stamos's character of the murder of the first love interest.   
  
Kate's father character did not make much sense to me. You did ""a lot"" of digging on this guy, something a reverse image search could have accomplished. And all that the dad discovered was the situation with Joe and his former wife, that's it. No links to anymore there or New York. To continue, the father was just ok with it all, and Kate as well, was ok with him being a sociopathy serial killer. This is crazy writing. Really no-one had any smart thinking in this season, it was full of coincidences and dumb decisions.   
  
  
Lady Phoebe's whole storyline was a waste of time. I was thinking that there was going to be a connection with her storyline and Joe's, but nope. She seemed like she was cool with him killing, as long as the body was hidden, crazy. Her going to teach kids at the end was nice, but her and all of the other side characters were a waste of screen time."
Dating Around,It took you until season four to realise the writing makes no sense?
Dating Around,"your complaints make no sense, ur questioning why a psychopathic killer who was experiencing dissociation killed people because of ""not much rationalization"" and yes not hiding Mariennes body was questionable but to me hiding her body was just extra work that wasnt necessary, he hides bodies that would be linked to him, NOt hiding her body isnt a ""plot twist"" in my opinion"
Dating Around,I’m happy with this season tbh. Much better than the coattail riding season of 3 from season 2
Dating Around,Anyone think Kate gives Ghislaine Maxwell vibes?
Dating Around,Another major plot hole I found ridiculous was the way in which Nadia found Marianne. It seems extremely unrealistic to me that nadia simply saw photos of joe frequently eating at that Indian place and somehow put together exactly where Marianne was . Not to mention the fact that she broke into an extremely observant serial killers home 2x and he didn’t even notice (even tho he had a camera planted in the same room) .
Dating Around,"I agree with all the points made by OP. It wasn’t fun to watch (yes, I still did), there were so many plot holes and the fact that they tried to give him a redemption arc and then gave him a happy ending is so old and predictable. Based on how they begun this season, they could’ve ended it so much stronger."
Dating Around,"**Could not agree more.** 

I found it painful watching the characters time after time make weird decisions. Joe started as a killer who killed but had thought behind it- in this season he seemed to turn into a psycho with no remorse and now will be killing for fun for Kate? HUUH

Watched it all but MY GOD, disliked the character assassination throughout. They have truely ruined his character, I can only predict the next season:

\- Joe kills for Kate

\- He over steps

\- She confronts him

\- They argue

\- If they want another season: she dies. If they are ending it: he dies. 

&#x200B;

Ez

Was nice to see Love again, though."
Dating Around,"I completely agree with you. This season was absolute garbage. Honestly, I was so mad when it was revealed that Rhys was just a figment of Joe’s imagination. It is incredibly cheap- just for shock value. Joe’s behavior does not make sense. Most of the character’s behaviors don’t. Season three Joe literally didn’t kill anyone without a thorough reason (Ryan and Love). He even ended up saving Theo and tried to let Gil free. Now we are supposed to believe that he just kills mindlessly, without reason? They really did assassinate his character. Does Netflix expected us to have forgotten what they laid out in previous seasons? honestly I’m incredibly mad and disappointed."
Dating Around,The problem with this season for me is that I hated every character. Even Kate…. No love for her. The first part was ok with the who did it theme. Yeah I’m still a you Stan but this season was just meh for me.
Dating Around,It reminded me of the dude that does AHS. Very interesting and pretty good until it has to wrap up and everything gets thrown out the window and you feel like you wasted your time
Dating Around,That’s how I felt until this season. It was sooo nonsensical that it wasn’t even fun anymore
Dating Around,What was plot armor about joe in this 2nd part? I swear yall love throwing that word around when theres plausable reasons for whatever it is
Dating Around,"How many people are going to use the useless phrase ""plot armor"" 😒 use your big words and explain exactly what you mean!"
Dating Around,"It's fun to watch a villain do what they do best! It's never been about Joe finding justice or completely believable murders. It's about a twisted man who justifies his actions any way he can.

I think he kills so easily because he's unraveling, and I for one love to see it. I'll also be watching till the end :)"
Dating Around,"I like the show a lot but I found it strange how the whole goal for him has been redemption, yet they leaned into him being an evil, non-regretful killer now… I guess I’m confused where they’re gonna go next"
Dating Around,Joe has the good lawyers 😂
Dating Around,"Not only that but Marianne wrote that in the letter she left for Joe that he read and then burned.

She literally requested that her buddy be found so that her daughter would have closure. 

It was not luck it was all part of the plan to keep her body safe and I guess there OP missed that part."
Dating Around,Right. So now she hasn't been found because she got up and left? Surely smart Joe would have realised there was no report of her death. She would have been identified from dental records or maybe even ID on her body as Joe wanted to make sure her daughter got closure?
Dating Around,The season 4 love interest will frustrate you even more
Dating Around,You should watch it. It will piss you off
Dating Around,">Killing Joe was Plan A, faking her death was Plan B. They probably hoped that Joe would leave her in public because a) He still cared about her (even by the end of Season 2 Joe had fallen out of love with Love) and b) Marienne didn’t want her daughter to have hope that she would return, and she knows they share a history of abandonment and living in foster care.

The best plan was to have the police arrest Joe. All these others were hinged on pure luck and plot convenience. Because he cared for her doesn't mean he couldn't have decided on a proper way to dispose her body. He could have burnt her up like his ex-wife, he left her to starve remember? She could suspect he had Multiple personality disorder

>Their plan was risky and bonkers but it makes sense that she was paranoid. Her ex-husband had just conveniently died, Love told her to run from Joe, then Joe “dies” in a murder-suicide that everyone thinks was committed by Love, he follows her across an ocean, chases her, lets her go, then kidnaps her and locks her in a glass cage.

No the plan doesn't make sense at all. Too many things could go wrong. You don't get locked up for months and decide to remain locked up with someone that hasn't fed you for a while. There was even no guarantee he would return. The plan to kill a professional could also easily go wrong. 

>The split-personality thing was odd but I feel it can still be rationalized. Joe thinks bad stuff just happens to him or that he just needs to do bad stuff. Splitting Joe into Joe and “Rhys” allows “Rhys” (and making Joe unaware) to do all the brutal, impulsive stuff he’s always had inside of him, while Joe is the rational person left to clean up the mess. When Joe and “Rhys” are forced to work together then we get back to normal Joe: dark yet meticulous

I don't have a  problem with the fixed personality, I have a problem with how it was executed. There was no way Joe would know for sure that Kate would rescue him from the fire. 

Joe in past seasons never killed for flimsy reasons. Why would Joe kill a drunk girl cos she said: the murders started after he appeared.

No one even took her seriously.

Joe mostly kills for obsession, love or to protect himself or those he loves. Even when he kills bad people, it isn't for flimsy reasons like that.

>As for Tom, he was probably thinking about killing two birds with one stone. He has Joe get rid of Rhys and then uses that to get rid of Joe.

He didn't know enough about Joe. All he knew was that Joe probably killed his wife and had no problems killing when necessary. For a smart businessman, it's far safer to use someone that can't be traced to him. He has done things like this. The show even said he knows how to clean and cover up.

For someone so protective of his daughter, no way he lets her hang around someone dangerous like that"
Dating Around,It has to be believable to some degree to be fun to watch. Otherwise it’s magical realism and that’s not what this show was supposed to be.
Dating Around,I feel like finding a dead homeless person in a busy city wouldn't rank highly on most news days but who knows.
Dating Around,"I know a lot of people disliked Beck when the first season was initially airing, but she had by far and away the most chemistry with Joe, and the writing for her was far stronger than any of the love interests that came after her."
Dating Around,I noticed that at the end. They just wanted him back in New York with no credible story on how to get him there
Dating Around,"You can't even read and understand what I typed. You just rushed to defend

I said it makes no sense that she would fake her death rather than just escape or call the police. It makes no sense because she had no idea what he would do to her body.

Remember he burnt his ex-wife...there's no guarantee he wouldn't cut up Marienna or bury her

Her gamble makes absolutely no sense especially when you look at the easy option of getting him arrested...which she refused to do because PLOT"
Dating Around,"That is what I though too. Nadia had  some pictures and is like, yup this is where he keeps his victims. This was too convenient."
Dating Around,"Completely agree, how would you say to end it? I thought they chose the worst option but not sure how I would've wanted it to continue. Almost wish it ended with him killing himself: unsatisfying, but an ending."
Dating Around,"There’s going to be another season?!??! People need to stop ruining good things. You’s expiration date was max season three, maybe even two."
Dating Around,"The show was adapted from it's books....

But I heard only up to Book 3 has been released...so Netflix went their own way for S4...

Explains the mediocre writing"
Dating Around,Felt this after season 3. But I thoroughly enjoyed season 4 more
Dating Around,I’m with you. Felt like they killed it this season. This want early joe
Dating Around,Seriously. He died but was lucky to get revived from the bay. It is broad daylight but no one sees him slit someone’s throat. His gf is apathetic to him being the one who murdered all her friends and her dad.
Dating Around,I was thinking about a news report at least of her body but ya know. ✨️✨️Tv magic✨️✨️
Dating Around,">The best plan was to have the police arrest Joe. All these others were hinged on pure luck and plot convenience.  
>

Of course getting the police would be the better plan, but she was traumatized, scared, tired, etc. The only thing that was keeping her going was her daughter. She wanted to get home and make sure the glove-trotting serial killer would never find her again.

>Because he cared for her doesn't mean he couldn't have decided on a proper way to dispose her body. He could have burnt her up like his ex-wife, he left her to starve remember? She could suspect he had Multiple personality disorder

We’re talking about after Marienne had already “died” though. He didn’t care about burning Love’s dead body because she tried to kill him, he didn’t love her anymore, and he needed a clean slate. He still cares about Marienne enough to grant her final wish. Plus she had a history of drug use, so dumping her on a park bench wouldn’t raise any red flags.

Yes, in previous season before he went off the deep end and started thinking he was engaging with a secret killer who was running for mayor of London and had memory lapses. Once he realizes what’s going on he’s no longer killing for flimsy reasons.

&#x200B;

>He didn't know enough about Joe. All he knew was that Joe probably killed his wife and had no problems killing when necessary. For a smart businessman, it's far safer to use someone that can't be traced to him. He has done things like this. The show even said he knows how to clean and cover up.  
For someone so protective of his daughter, no way he lets her hang around someone dangerous like that

He always kept track of all her previous boyfriends and guys she was seeing, and she admitted she used to have a thing for dangerous men. But he said she usually managed to end up losing them or driving them away rather than having to get rid of them himself. Plus it was shown he can control the media. He can erase any connection Joe has to Kate or himself. Having an actual fall guy the media could actually be more helpful than a popular candidate just disappearing out of the blue or showing up dead with no leads."
Dating Around,The whole point though was for Marienne to be found and identified for her daughter to get Closure so surely Joe would want to make sure his great plan of leaving her on a bench with a weak pulse definitely worked?
Dating Around,And her reaction to finding out his depravity was accurate
Dating Around,Agreed. I think they set it up for another season... I guess we shall see.
Dating Around,That makes sense
Dating Around,"So do you not know how the real world works. As stated in the show there are people watching the area because its a popular spot for people to jump from. And do you not believe in medicine or science? From personal experience i can tell you people survive drowning. When i was like 16 i got pulled out to sea and was basically dead, but here i am writing this. The only unrealistic thing about that scenario was how fast his recovery time was.

Did you not see the body was hidden in a non populated area behind a car with trees around. Its not that hard to understand…. He didnt just kil him in the middle of a busy highway 

Joe never said he killed all her friends and dad. He only specified that he killed people before. And we know kate is not all the way sane either. She is used to her father disappearing people (killing them) she herself gave kids cancer. And she did dispose of a body previously with joe. She loves him and so she accepts him. 

Im really trying to understand how this is plot armor to u, its not rocket science."
Dating Around,Good point on that. Just another thing to move the story along. unfortunately...
Dating Around,">We’re talking about after Marienne had already “died” though. He didn’t care about burning Love’s dead body because she tried to kill him, he didn’t love her anymore, and he needed a clean slate. He still cares about Marienne enough to grant her final wish. Plus she had a history of drug use, so dumping her on a park bench wouldn’t raise any red flags.

This is such a huge gamble on her part. That's why it's irrational. It relies solely on plot convenience.


>Yes, in previous season before he went off the deep end and started thinking he was engaging with a secret killer who was running for mayor of London and had memory lapses. Once he realizes what’s going on he’s no longer killing for flimsy reasons.

This right here is a problem. Having MPD doesn't change the fact that he's smart to cover up his tracks. Killing randomly for no good reason doesn't make sense.


>He always kept track of all her previous boyfriends and guys she was seeing, and she admitted she used to have a thing for dangerous men. But he said she usually managed to end up losing them or driving them away rather than having to get rid of them himself. Plus it was shown he can control the media.

Having an actual fall guy the media could actually be more helpful than a popular candidate just disappearing out of the blue or showing up dead with no leads.

Your political rival being killed by the guy who your daughter is dating isn't an ideal situation. There was no way using Joe was a better choice"
Dating Around,"My man was a serial killer walking around in broad daylight, who just so happened to end up with a billionaire girlfriend that was okay with him killing at least one person that she personally knew. It's also absolutely bonkers that he committed all of those murders himself and never got caught. Like the police in London must be absolute dipshits to not put 2 and 2 and 2 and 2 together. Also the absolutely stupidest part of the entire season was Nadia not calling the cops immediately when she found Marianne. Like her being a little Nancy Drew and conveniently fucking the whole thing up was just incredibly lucky for Joe, and the show even hinted at his plot armor here. ""If you call the cops on him he'll just weasel away again."" I'm sorry but Joe is one of the most plot armored characters I've ever seen in fiction."
Dirty John,"Have you tried Mr Inbetween. Set in Australia. About a hit man, his work and relationship problems. I loved it."
Dirty John,"Not a tv show, but have you listened to the Dirty John podcast? It preceded the television series and is about Meehan. It’s done in the style of Serial and is told through interviews by the actual people that were involved.  Reported and hosted by Christopher Goffard from the L.A. Times.

https://rss.art19.com/dirty-john"
Dirty John,"Dr. Death. Came out this summer. Similar true crime, scared me how true it was based off what I read and saw interviews"
Dirty John,I listened to the podcast.
Dirty John,Yeah i talked about it a while ago.
Dirty John,Nope haven't listened to any podcasts. I prefer movies or tv shows.
Dirty John,Very good show. Hope there are more seasons. They should do one on dr patel. What a monster he was.
Dirty John,"There are two other seasons of the podcast, so they might do those first. Maybe? The second season was really short. The third season was meh in general."
Dirty John,"I don't recall anything 'Dirty John'-ish about the Broderick case. 

IMO if 'DJ' is going to become a meme...'Dirty John presents...' then I have little interest."
Dirty John,Curious to see how they portray everyone in this. 30 years later she's still [deeply unrepentant](https://www.10news.com/news/local-news/three-decades-later-betty-broderick-still-unapologetic)
Dirty John,Poor Amanda. She really wants that Emmy.
Dirty John,"Tripted, Betty has come up for parole, but yes she is unrepentant. She probably could have been out already, but she still thinks she did the right thing."
Dirty John,DVR set!
Dirty John,"This is hard to watch if you have seen the movie with Meredith Baxter Birney as Elizabeth Broderick. They need a blond..maybe January Jones? I have read all the books, watched the movies, etc. so I’m not expecting anything new from this."
Dirty John,"I felt sorry for her and could totally understand how she went off the rails. I don’t condone murder in any case but I have to say he got what he deserved.

Edit: I don’t know how many of you who downvoted me followed this case. I did. And the things he did to her were reprehensible. I’m not talking just in material ways, but also emotionally. No human should be treated like that."
Dirty John,You’re right.
Dirty John,I had the same question. Wasn’t Dirty John a story in itself? How does the Betty Broderick murder fit in? Is this just the name for a new series about murders?
Dirty John,She was incredible in it. At least I thought so. I had no clue she could act so well.
Dirty John,January Jones would have been great!
Dirty John,You are condoning murder by saying he deserved to be murdered.
Dirty John,"Plenty of people are treated horribly all the time and can walk away.  She was just as bad in her own ways.  Believe me, I have followed this VERY closely.  She got approx 20k in spousal support in the late 80s.  Not saying money is everything, but she could have started her life separate of Dan and been completely fine.  She took away parents to their children (which she says she cared about the most).  “No one deserves to die” can be a figment of speech....but it shouldn’t be used in this case.  Sorry, I have to downvote you."
Dirty John,Just bc I say “that guy deserves to killed” isn’t saying he *should* be killed. The same as when someone says “I could just kill him” doesn’t mean they’re going to or have someone do it for them.
Dirty John,"I guess it makes sense for Audible since I would never pay for Wondery premium. 

""Dirty John"" season 1 was great but none of their other shows won me over the same way. ""Over My Dead Body"" in particular was disappointing and kind of confusing in how they told the story. 

Other than ""Guru,"" which was so oddball it got my attention on weirdness alone, a lot of their podcasts follow the DJ formula and got progressively trashier. The faux-NPR type voices they use doesn't really elevate that they're basically Dateline stories stretched to six episodes."
Dirty John,"Here's an article that goes into why Hollywood likes podcasts as source material:

[https://digiday.com/media/why-universal-content-productions-believes-in-podcasts/](https://digiday.com/media/why-universal-content-productions-believes-in-podcasts/)"
Dirty John,I have never heard of any of these. (I’m a daily podcast listener and weekly new show searcher).
Dirty John,Well that's embarrassing for you. These are really well known and popular podcasts.
Dirty John,"I think their most popular one is Business Wars, though that's pess of a unified narrative."
Dirty John,"I guess you’re right? Also, I don’t feel embarrassed. (Should I?)"
Dirty John,"I enjoyed the podcast much more. 
I cannot believe people (with money) aren't smarter with background checks! LOL"
Dirty John,"The acting was good but that was it. It’s just a fancier lifetime series. 
I had a hard time finishing it because Connie’s character was so damn stupid. I couldn’t handle it. I did watch the documentary that went with it after and I think it would have been enough. It didn’t need the show."
Dirty John,"There is a documentary on QXYGEN that follows the DJ story. Its pretty excellent to watch if, like me, you want to know MORE about the real story.

Also...YES Eric Bana & Connie B kill it."
Dirty John,"It’s awful and exploitative like that Showtime piece of crap with Patricia Arquette about the woman in New York who helped prisoners escape. The reporter who serialized it originally for the LA Times is scum in my opinion and the story, while being terrible in real life, is really a tale of a moron who couldn’t see obvious signs and is not worth anyone’s time watching. On top of that, anyone who followed the news at all knew these stories long before they were sensationalized by assholes in Hollywood running second rate production companies."
Dirty John,"Yeah, after listening to that podcast I was amazed that family had gotten that far being so naive. The lengths they went to get the man who murdered their daughter released was beyond belief."
Dirty John,"If you could point me in the direction of a 2016-2017 article about John Meehan, I’d actually be pretty interested."
Dirty John,What the fuck are you going on about? She was sad and lonely and was duped by hustlers but it doesn't make her innocent. In fact the show let us know these guys were pieces of shit as well
Dirty John,"You would absolutely love Michael Bays, Pain & Gain then."
Dirty John,You mean Escape at Dannemora? That was one of the best miniseries ever made..
Dirty John,"I know. They’re all pieces of shit. At least Tiger King gave people something different amongst these types of stories. Neither of these stories talked about here are worth anyone’s time, they’re exploitative top to finish. Strictly lowest common denominator garbage television. Like most daytime television, actually, and a lot of other horrible programming."
Dirty John,"Saw it. And what I came away thinking was Martin Scorcese could really have done the story justice. It was originally a series of articles in the Miami New Times. It deserved better than it got. There was a real story there, with numerous bizarre characters with weird motives. Tiger King is similar in that respect as a true story."
Dirty John,Yeah that's not true.
Dirty John,There’s more Dirty Johns!?
Dirty John,Ah that first season was fun.
Dirty John,"Someone please tell me...

Is this any good to watch? I enjoyed the podcast but I worry this isn't worth it since I know the ending.

Also does it somehow go past the events of the podcast?"
Dirty John,"I didn't know they were continuing this.

Sounds like similar types of stories to the original case being covered.

I'll watch"
Dirty John,We want her husband though...
Dirty John,This is a different Dirty John? Dirty John 2: Dirtier John
Dirty John,2 Dirty 2 John
Dirty John,"I watched the documentary and the show, I'm still in disbelief how it all ended."
Dirty John,It’s good to watch with a loved one.
Dirty John,"I wasn't familiar with the story prior to watching, and I enjoyed it.  Connie Britton got all the raves, but I really enjoyed Eric Bana's performance.  I'd never seen him play a charming psychopath before, and he really nails it."
Dirty John,"So, I never bothered to finish the last episode. The podcast was just so much better. 

They also made her daughters unbearable on the show despite seeming like great people on the podcast. 

I think I might have liked it better if I had watched the show first. The acting is great though. I would say it's worth trying out but no new information is revealed that wasnt already in the podcast."
Dirty John,It says story is from a double homicide and the story starts in the 60s.
Dirty John,Chopper had a certain charm to him.
Dirty John,"They are great people on the show, but they're also rich valley girls emotionally damaged from a mom 4 times divorced who wont listen when they see her making the same mistakes again. They had their own careers they took seriously and were successful with and put family first always. You might have been turned off by the archetype they were portraying but it was pretty accurate."
Dirty John,"The Dirty John + USA part confused me. Let me save you some googling: Yes, it's that same Dirty John that aired on Bravo and is based on the true story podcast. It's the same showrunners and they're turning the name into an anthology series, and USA now has the rights."
Dirty John,Meredith Baxter Birney played this role to perfection in the TV movie.
Dirty John,"All you needed to convince me was Amanda Peet, and she looks great here as expected. I'm in."
Dirty John,"They can’t outdo the original movie with Meredith Baxter as Betty. They should at least have a bleached blonde. I watched the first two episodes, but there was no new information. I’m also stumped by the title. Dirty John was a story! Why is this called Dirty John when it’s about Betty Broderick? Sorry for the Broderick kids that this is dug up 30 years later. I guess there might be enough young people that don’t know the story? Betty could probably be out of prison by now, but at her parole hearings, she still will not claim that she did anything wrong!"
Dirty John,So basically another remake. Meredith Baxter(she doesn't go by Birney anymore) cannot be outdone.
Dirty John,"It's still owned by NBCUniversal (Bravo), they just moved it to their sister network to gain a bigger audience since USA is more known for scripted programming than Bravo."
Dirty John,Telling the same true story doesn't make it a remake lol
Dirty John,Ah. Makes sense.
Dirty John,"So in case people are confused by Umbrella Academy and The Act: There wasn't a great way to make this clear in the headline, but Dawn ran the Cable and Streaming-focused studio at NBCUniversal, which sold shows both to NBCU cable channels (Mr. Robot to USA, Dirty John to Bravo, Happy to SyFy), and externally to other outlets like Netflix with Umbrella Academy.

This isn't necessarily a death blow to UCP - [for a start, they did take pains to promote some people internally into bigger roles](https://deadline.com/2019/07/ucp-scott-nemes-oversee-development-current-garrett-kemble-head-of-development-1202643023/), including Garrett Kemble, who was in charge of overseeing shows like Mr. Robot, Dare Me, Briarpatch, The Act and Homecoming. It does, however, put them in a weird position of having every single one of their scripted studios leaderless - Universal TV's old head, Pearlena Igbokwe, was recently promoted to oversee all studios, while the old head of NBC International Studios, Jeff Wachtel, was ousted after complaints about behavior and management style. Dawn Olmstead was also very enthusiastic about branching out into podcasting and graphic novels in order to make IP, so I'm curious if those ventures will remain after she departs."
Dirty John,"great Résumé, good luck to her in the future"
Dirty John,"I binged it. Never listened to the podcast, but I have see a crime show where the interviewed Debra and the youngest daughter. This is a true story and it's unreal. I just want to comment a little on the acting. The cast included some top notch actors that I love, but one stood out as lukewarm. 

Hear me out. I think Connie Britton is good in everything she does, but I didn't really love her in this. The character was so meek and naive, but Connie didn't pull that off really well. I get that this is the character of Debra, but it just didn't ring true to me. I could be biased because Debra was just dumb and infuriating. 

Both Eric Bana and Jean Smart were really good. He was super creepy."
Dirty John,I'll have to give it a shot. I listened to the podcast recently - what a wild story!
Dirty John,I have almost no sympathy for Debra. She’s a colossal moron. She almost got her child murdered.
Dirty John,Good show.
Dirty John,"I was thinking of starting this series.

I hope its more crime/drama than chick-flic?

Is it worth the investing the time in?"
Dirty John,I am watching it now and I am confused. Is Toby the same boy as John in the flashbacks? Where did Toby go?
Dirty John,But what could season 2 really be about? He’s dead
Dirty John,"its a new story with a new cast with no relevance to the first season so its a bit weird, i guess calling it season 2 rather than a new show keeps the audience"
Dirty John,"So it'll be, ""From the makers of ""Dirth John"" comes another true crime story,  ""Dr Death.""

&#x200B;

That kind of thing?"
Dirty John,Oh ok. So another Dirty John type character
Dirty John,"I think it will still be titled dirty john, and then similar concept to american crime story first season was on oj and then 2nd was Versace, so each season of dirty john will be on a different scheme"
Dirty John,Anthology series about psychopath men threatening women with the same name... LOL
Dirty John,But the title of this one screws that up. American crime story both seasons. Dirty John specifically refers to dirty john.
Dirty John,But the title of this one screws that up. American crime story both seasons. Dirty John specifically refers to dirty john.
Dirty John,"How about we got the Jason X route. John wakes up frozen on a spacecraft, seduces the female captain."
Dirty John,The world needs more Eric Bana.
Dirty John,Totally read this and somehow thought we got a johnny bravo live action show... 
Dirty John,Does anyone know how I can watch Bravo since I don't have cable? I do have roku though.
Dirty John,I'm guessing this is based off of the podcast? Or is this fresh material?
Dirty John,"Just listen to the podcast. It's good, doubt it's quality enough for a tv series."
Dirty John,Connie Britton is everywhere these days!
Dirty John,Dirty Johnny Bravo is the porn parody. 
Dirty John,They genderswapped two of the only non psycho male characters even though the story has plenty of female characters. That doesn't bode well.
Dirty John,Information i never needed but now have thanks Gtobes 😂
Dirty John,"Never heard the podcast, so i can't make any comparisons, and I don't know the story beyond the first episode,  but i found the episode enjoyable and Connie Britton was wonderful as always. Her character annoys me,  but I think it's supposed to. "
Dirty John,"How is this? 

I found the podcast really engaging.

It's coming to Netflix at some stage here in Australia."
Dirty John,"I found her character in the podcast really frustrating and annoying, so I'd say she's playing it right.  "
Dirty John,The woman in the podcast makes you want to reach into your headset/speaker and smack some sense into her
Dirty John,"I'd say she's not annoying *enough*. Enjoyed it though, but it seems they're taking it from a different angle to the podcast."
Dirty John,That's quite a cast.
Dirty John,Absolutely loved the podcast. I really hope Bravo pulls this off. 
Dirty John,The podcast was great but Eric Bana might get me to actually watch this. And they kept the awful baby voices for the daughters! That's kinda nice.
Dirty John,GREAT podcast
Dirty John,Bruce Banner cannot be trusted. 
Dirty John,That redneck daughter from Ozark is getting a lot of gigs! She’s amazing on Ozark and she had a small scene in Maniac. And now she’s playing a rich valley girl. 
Dirty John,"As much as this has a fantastic cast, the stupidity of the real life woman at the centre of this story so enraged me in the podcast that i'm not sure I can watch it.

(Debra's mother was also bizarrely stupid, so perhaps that's where she got it from...)"
Flavorful Origins,"San Junipero was beautiful, but the episode that most impressed me was Shut up and Dance. It was like a punch in the gut - extremely well done."
Flavorful Origins,The true successor of *The Twilight Zone*.
Flavorful Origins,"Love this show!

Lot of truly great episodes but 'Fifteen Million Merits' has got to be my favorite. Great on so many levels."
Flavorful Origins,Black Mirror is absolutely fantastic and hope for a sixth season was the reason I held onto Netflix for so long
Flavorful Origins,"Is that the show where the Prime Minister has sex with a pig?

(which of course later happened in real life)"
Flavorful Origins,and rapidly went to shit once Charlie grabbed that boatload of American money
Flavorful Origins,One of the very few times I got in early on a show. Heard about the first episode on a podcast and was hooked from then. I’m not from the UK either so I had to download all the episodes before they were available on streaming. I think I still have the files too
Flavorful Origins,"With the World Cup on, it felt like I couldn't have chosen a worse time to rewatch Black Mirror lol. But I got through it and enjoyed every episode just the same. 😊

Flavorful Origins,Best show ever.
Flavorful Origins,"Hard to keep up the standard of those first few eps and some repetition was inevitable over time, but will say I think San Junipero is hands down the best thing the show or Brooker ever did, one of the best hours of television I've ever seen, and the Netflix deal was worth it for that alone. It's superb, if it were a movie I think I would put it up there with Eternal Sunshine.

I wish I could recapture how incredible ""National Anthem"" was to see ""live"" at the same time as everyone else, too,after the marketing campaign. The blurry meta between why you were watching it and why the people in the show were watching it was both thrilling and unsettling.

I consider those the show's two strongest eps, but each one was only really possible to get made for Netflix or C4 respectively, so the show's lifecycle has been interesting to watch play out. People think the Netflix move weakened it, but I don't, I think the show had gone as far as it could with C4, and the deal gave it a brief new lease of life beyond what it would otherwise have been able to manage. 

I firmly believe Black Museum was meant to be the last episode, Brooker metaphorically having his show burn itself down, and think it's a good note to see as its final statement."
Flavorful Origins,why did i just think 11 years ago was like 2002..
Flavorful Origins,"Black Mirror never vibed with me but apparently that is because I have a ""Reductive"" take. Every episode I watched or was reccomended to me fell pretty flat. Each episode gave the sense the show wanted me to be super impressed with this dystopian idea and every single time it was basically just ""What if technology, BUT BAD!"" 

&#x200B;

Don't even disagree with themes or ideas but like the show is much worse if it is not your first time coming accross these ideas. 

&#x200B;

Probably a great show for many. But if you read a lot of Scifi already or are even mildly depressed or are just generally pessimistic about the future of technology, then nothing in Black Mirror is going to blow your mind."
Flavorful Origins,then netflix poured gasoline on it and lit it a blaze.
Flavorful Origins,it could be here in a year
Flavorful Origins,Yes that was the first episode
Flavorful Origins,"It didn’t happen later, it was revealed to have happened in the past. Which is own can of worms imo."
Flavorful Origins,"I wouldn't say rapidly, but more that it but the seasons had fewer good episodes as it went on. Not to mention the constant use of the digital clones of people. The fifth season used that three times. Three times, in a season of 6 episodes. 

I personally liked Bandersnatch, but the sixth season was it for me.  Three episodes, and each of them were crap. Two guys who were gay for each other as long as it was only in digital form and not IRL, an episode that's sole fucking message was ""Twitter bad"" (That was it. No real twist, just...Twitter bad), and an episode that A: Had a digital clone in it and B: made me appreciate Myley Cyrus as an actor. She was legit in that episode."
Flavorful Origins,"The first time I saw or even heard of Black Mirror I was browsing Netflix while alone during winter break in college. I was like eff it I’ll put this on idk what it is. I almost turned it off immediately because the opening scene is just the phone ringing and him not answering, which annoyed the hell out of me. I almost shut it off then and there but the remote was too far away. Glad I didn’t and blew through the series that week lol"
Flavorful Origins,"Well said. I agree with everything you said. Netflix allowed Black Mirror to grow. San Junipero is the epitome of that growth. As I said in the post, it's the best episode of Black Mirror if there must be one, and it being a deviation from what the show usually does shows that Black Mirror can still be so much more."
Flavorful Origins,Black Mirror has a few really good episodes but I feel like most of them could have cut 15-20 minutes of runtime and been better for it.
Flavorful Origins,how old are you? i find that people in their 30s often make this mistake for some reason.
Flavorful Origins,"It didn’t happen at all. The sole source was Lord Ashcroft, who had a score to settle with Cameron."

Flavorful Origins,"I felt the same way more or less on the first episode. I recommend you give it at least one more episode. I'm on three or four now and I'm all in at this point. Thing is kicking ass and there's a little mystery around Christina Ricci's character now. There's more than meets the eye going on for a Normie. The psychiatrist too.  The show gets pretty dark too.

If not, it's all good. Up vote because it's okay to have a different opinion!"
Flavorful Origins,"Eh, it’s perfectly fine (a little YA,  but still fine) and Ortega is fantastic in the role.  

PS-Addams."
Flavorful Origins,"It's meant to be less humor and more dark, typical YP.

Think of it as the Archie comic remake ""Riverdale"", or the ""Sabrina"" series...take an old sitcom and update it with modern sensibilities.  A little nostalgia for the old folks, and something fresh for the young.

The real surprise was Tim Burton being one of the producers and director of some episodes.  You can feel his tone, but it is very low key compared to his other stuff.  Very positive results."
Flavorful Origins,"The Addams family is an episodic thing. It’s not designed to have character arcs, or enduring story lines.  The tensions between the conceit, and reality get threadbare really quickly.  All things considered, I think they did a decent job of balancing the signature weirdness, with the compromises required to make a series with the above mentioned actual character arc, relationships and development, and the needs of a persistent plot. 

It’s not Adult Wednesday Addams - which I still adore - but (again), that was like the original show, and comic, all vignettes, which make it far simpler to gloss over the the threadbare spots where the narrative bumps up against reality."
Flavorful Origins,No regerts watching the first season.  It does get better as you go.
Flavorful Origins,It’s very Harry potter-eque.  But I enjoyed it honestly.
Flavorful Origins,It’s an odd show for sure. I guess every show needs to be about a detective solving something now. But her visions make her a bad detective.
Flavorful Origins,"I enjoyed the classic TV show, the movies, and I enjoyed Wednesday as well. The movie and the original show definitely hit differently than Wednesday, so I can see how it’s not for everyone. 

I’m a sucker for teen sleuths, I religiously read Nancy Drew growing up, so I was still happy when Wednesday went in that direction; I just don’t think the show was advertising that Wednesday is **that** kind of series well at all. I understand how people could be disappointed if you’re expecting something in the vein of the 90’s movies, because it’s definitely different."
Flavorful Origins,"I get not liking a show, plenty of popular ones I don't get bet if you're comparing a sitcom from the 60's and two subsequent feature films against a 50-minute young adult streaming series you're going to have a bad time."
Flavorful Origins,"I mean it's supposed to be an adaptation and a spin off, not a continuation or a rehash.
  
It's also targeted at teenage girls a la Riverdale or Chilling Adventures of Sabrina.
  
If you're old enough to remember the old cartoon/adaptation, this was not targeted at you.
  
The downvotes are likely because posts identical to yours are made daily"
Flavorful Origins,"The thing is if you watched the Addams family movies in the 90s when they came out and you were a kid or older- listen closely - IT IS HARD TO WATCH HIGH SCHOOL SHIT when you’re older than 25. (I myself am vaguely in the 30ish range). High school drama shit is just stupid in your 30s+ okay. Let’s not pretend it’s not. 

To watch Wednesday you do have to look past a bunch of shit. Like why is she the only outcast of all outcasts to wear a black uniform? Wouldn’t more *outcasts* wear black?! Why is she so narcissistic? Why does she hate her parents who give her the most gothic-perfect everything? I have so many questions regarding Wednesday and her family that are unanswered. 

Why does everyone hate or love Fester? The questions are truly endless. Af the end of the day you can either suspend your belief/disbelief and accept the goofy, weird FLAVOR of Wednesday Addams or not. I pushed my own prejudice aside because I wanted to witness the HOOPLA that Wednesday had to offer. It was quite the ride. I love the Addams. I was pleasantly surprised. The show is not for everyone but you WILL be surprised."
Flavorful Origins,"Not all the way through yet, but it's fine. One thing I've noticed is that the camera cuts like every 3 seconds.

I'm used to lots of cuts in action scenes, but they're cutting back and forth after every line of dialogue."
Flavorful Origins,"Took an episode or two to get into it, but it's enjoyable, and I like a decent mystery. It's definitely not the sitcom, thought they managed to keep a little bit of camp. It reminds me a little of Riverdale, and Tim Burton's influence is definitely there. The show has a bit of visual appeal as well. Ortega does shows a lot of talent playing a deadpan (no pun) character. I think it takes a lot of range to effectively deal with a character without much range, if that makes sense."
Flavorful Origins,"People don’t owe you a response if they downvote, that’s how Reddit works."
Flavorful Origins,"I feel this series got better as it went on.  I'd give it a shot for a few more episodes before writing it off.

It's different than the original content - I ended up watching movie I'm nostalgic about after (91') and probably enjoyed it a bit more than this show - but it was still a fun watch"
Flavorful Origins,"“New bad!”.

Ugh, another one?"
Flavorful Origins,"It was a bad casting for Gomez that made it feel off, if they would have chosen someone more energetic that played just over the edge of gleefully unhinged the whole story would have done well.  As your introduction and acceptance of the cast would have easily crossed over the suspension of disbelief."
Flavorful Origins,"While watching I kept thinking ""I enjoyed Sabrina a lot more."""
Flavorful Origins,"Are you a tween/teen girl?  If no, then you're not the target demographic for this show.  

It's not supposed to be fine cinema, it's a fun/dark humor show for middle schoolers.  For which it's a huge hit."
Flavorful Origins,"Wow this is a controversial take but I kind of agree with you and feel like I’m taking crazy pills. I think people are mostly caught up in the aesthetics, Jenna’s amazing acting, the soundtrack and the side characters. Like if it was just Wednesday and Enid I think it could be pretty great"
Flavorful Origins,It feels like another bullshit high school drama to me. Can’t get past the first couple of episodes because of it.
Flavorful Origins,"I died laughing at that one person who said it 'succeeded in being what the Sabrina remake tried and failed to do"".

Fuckin. Wut."
Flavorful Origins,Wasn’t it literally an early YouTube web series?
Flavorful Origins,"It’s really not that great what I saw. Visually it’s stunning, but I think most of the success is from young (and not so young) women fan-girling over Jenna Ortega and wanting to be like her. It’s not surprising the dance has gone so viral on tik tok. The essence of hot misunderstood goth girl is what is driving the popularity."
Flavorful Origins,I think you’re getting downvoted not just because they disagree but also due to your personality 🤷‍♂️
Flavorful Origins,It's shit that's why.
Flavorful Origins,"My gf and I tried watching and both stopped half way through the first episode.  I really enjoyed the Addams family movies as a kid, probably haven't seen one in like 15 years, but I don't remember Wednesday being so......insufferable?  She just sucks  in this show, at least in the beginning and neither one of us were interested in finding out if it got better."
Flavorful Origins,"It’s just got “the Netflix show feel” yes Tim burton was a producer, and director of a few episodes but look at the writers and cinematographers. All generic people hired by Netflix."
Flavorful Origins,Sketch
Flavorful Origins,"I hear you, I felt the same way too. Imo the first episode is a little heavy handed and it felt a bit like parody to me. Something about it felt.. forced? I guess is how I would describe it. It's hard for me to put into words but the vibe was off for me. 

But as the show went on it totally hooked me! It's got good character development, a fun/interesting storyline, it's visually appealing. Great cast to boot. What's not to love? It's definitely a slow burn for some (myself included). I would say episode 3 is where it started to find it's footing. I'm glad I stuck with it and I'm looking forward to season 2. It ended up being a lot of fun!"
Flavorful Origins,"in the movies, wednesday's one liners and cutting remarks were so 'sharp' and funny.  in the show, they just felt sort of mean.  I don't know if it was the writing or what but the movies were so much more of everything than the show.  Like, Gomez and Morticia had no chemistry in the show while in the movie, they practically set the screen on fire.  Uncle Fester was weird in the show even though I usually like the actor...I tried to see the show on its own merits but it just didn't hit the same for me."
Flavorful Origins,"I felt the same. 

I loved the production and the Tim Burton vibes but the writing was def weak."
Flavorful Origins,How can you fell that the whole show is off if you've only watched the first episode? I'd understand that statement if you'd watched the whole show.
Flavorful Origins,"I think it’s just typical Netflix garbage. Tim Burton probably wants to do some interesting things, but Netflix practically demands you deliver trash content."
Flavorful Origins,"I sense what you’re saying. 

A more apt comparison would be, “Mr. Pibb instead of Dr. Pepper”, for off brand flavor. lol"
Flavorful Origins,"Uh...  its kinda wierd to be watching a murder mystery and commenting on the comedy not being good enough...

Hey guys, i dunno about citizen kane either.  The jokes just were not landing with me!

And don't get me started on how bad the jokes in schindlers list were!"
Flavorful Origins,"I will just say, Metallica cover was greatly used."
Flavorful Origins,I have to agree... I fell asleep in the first episode bc it didn't engage me enough but after that I was talking to a friend and they convinced me to give it another shot and i do think it was worth it.
Flavorful Origins,"Sorry autocorrect, anywho....

Maybe it's the YA....like they YAd it up a little too much to be perfect ..so they adjusted the character a little to fit a better box"
Flavorful Origins,""" you can feel his tone but it is very low key compared to his other stuff."" Thank God."
Flavorful Origins,"No regerts, not even one letter?"
Flavorful Origins,"You're the second to say this... Mayyyybe I'll visit up to episode 4... 

But I fear I'll have Stockholm syndrome by then.... And even if I still think it sucks ..I'll finish just because I'm already basically pot committed"
Flavorful Origins,Reminded me more of Veronica mars. I also enjoyed it.
Flavorful Origins,"Is that what actually plays out...she becomes Wednesday Holmes?


....god we need another season of Sherlock....can Cumberbatch stop playing Dr magician at marvel for two years so another season can come out"
Flavorful Origins,"Lol... Yeah, I think it was the Gomez and Morticia part that really turned me off thinking even more about it

Others have made solid pleas to give it a chance for a few episodes.....so I may actually revisit"
Flavorful Origins,Really?!? I enjoyed it a LOT and I'm a 52 year old man.
Flavorful Origins,She never blinks. Maybe that’s it?
Flavorful Origins,Makes dialogue seem snappier and disguise the fact that actual conversations don’t occur like this
Flavorful Origins,"New is bad if it doesn't really feel like source material.

If you can slap a new name on the show and have no one notice what the source material originally was, it's off putting.

My beef isn't with the show, at least as of right now, it's the fact it feels like someone who read a synopsis of the Addams family and just wrote a script about their daughter based on a paragraph they read."
Flavorful Origins,"I really honestly believe it was Morticia and Gomez that left a bad taste... Still haven't gotten around to watching more because of time limitations, but I really think Luis Guzman was a bad choice, and I do like him.... But he comes off as more desperate for love and affection, like he begs for hugs from his wife....  It just plays weird"
Flavorful Origins,Agreed.  I liked Wednesday but I LOVED Sabrina.
Flavorful Origins,"You’re thinking of Adult Wednesday Addams, which is a bunch of sketch shorts and completely unrelated.

Edit: I just looked it up, and apparently the creator got a C&D: https://www.buzzfeed.com/andyneuenschwander/this-wednesday-addams-web-series-was-pulled-due-to-copyright"
Flavorful Origins,"Not sure....my description in the title is just what it feels like....

Someone had a week to come up with a Wednesday Addams skit....and bam tv show .."
Flavorful Origins,"To be fair.... A lot of people are recommending to go past episode one since they also did not like the first episode, and I have been saying I am willing to take the plunge...

So.i mean, sorry if I offended by saying the show felt off to me, but it just doesn't have the Addams family charm I was expecting.

You can't tell me the Morticia and Gomez car scene didn't feel a little ""one take""ish... It just felt weird"
Flavorful Origins,It's ok... It's just not Addams family....like it's in the AFCU....but just doesn't feel character appropriate
Flavorful Origins,"The movie only took llke 15 minutes to prove it was very Addams family..... I gave this show 55 minutes 

At that point the movie was almost over"
Flavorful Origins,Yeah... Like I get what they are doing... But it's....it's just not the same
Flavorful Origins,Very much so. I might have gotten goosebumps during the montage while that played.
Flavorful Origins,"YA= Young adults. This show is built for teens and young adults. The Addams Family first aired in 1964. SNL started in 1975. I'm not sure what you're looking for in the show but it's broken a lot of Netflix records. 

I'm not even a Tim Burton fan but the show had strong acting. Ortega has been nailing her jobs lately. It's nice seeing a couple people coming from the Disney channel and not being fucked up child actors who burn out."
Flavorful Origins,"The plot is nothing outstanding, but the cinematic work (scenography, camera work, acting, sound) is very well done and makes the show worth it on it's own."
Flavorful Origins,The last season of sherlock wasn’t that great iirc.
Flavorful Origins,"For anything to lazy you click on this, this happened back in 2015, and it wasn't because of the Netflix show."
Flavorful Origins,"I don’t disagree with you, it’s got that yucky generic-ness i associate with Netflix originals. Like the CW with more budget or Hallmark with licensed characters."
Flavorful Origins,"I’m sure you’re fine. I just noticed that someone would comment and your reply would be downvoted a bunch. 

I shouldn’t have said personality.

I should have said tone. I think the tone of your replies in the comments was interpreted as negative and that’s why you were downvoted.

Again, I’m sure your personality is fine."
Flavorful Origins,"I mean it wasn't the best , but it was still half decent....any bad episode of Sherlock is still pretty good"
Flavorful Origins,"Meh it's fine... I was hoping for people to convince me to continue on with this post tbh.... Or just to go ""yeahhhhh it's just all weird""

Enough people said the first episode was the worst...so I'm willing to see what else happens"
Flavorful Origins,"I totally agree with your post, but this right here is a dumpster fire take :P"
Flavorful Origins,"Funnily enough, I disagree with most of your takes in this thread, but this one (which is controversial) I very much agree with."
Flavorful Origins,LOL at the announcers subtly undermining Pepsi. “You gotta grab a Pepsi?” “And scan it.” “Sounds like a lot of work.”
Flavorful Origins,"""Yeah this will win people in the heartland over.""

Nailed It! Mexico,"I work in the film industry in New Mexico. There's an enormous amount of demand for studio space, and it's getting bigger every year. This new studio space is going to be incredibly productive for the state and for the pueblo. Huge win for New Mexico."
Nailed It! Mexico,That’s really cool. I hope they’re successful.
Nailed It! Mexico,I was already looking forward to Dark Winds; it's cool that they're able to shoot on native land like this. Should add some verisimilitude.
Nailed It! Mexico,More competition in the industry and possibly diversifying styles seems good
Nailed It! Mexico,"As a native actor, it’s very nice and encouraging to see this."
Nailed It! Mexico,"Florida used to host many film and TV projects, due to excellent tax breaks that made it a great place to shoot. Unfortunately, Republican governor/ convicted criminal/current Senator/ all around piece of shit Rick Scott unilaterally abolished that program, because he didn't want ""Liberal Hollywood"" to get the benefit of Florida tax breaks and influence our citizens. So our neighbor, bright red Georgia, was happy to take the annual $8 billion in revenue that the movie/TV industry generated in our state. 

Just one more way that Rick Scott cost Florida billions of dollars and thousands of jobs."
Nailed It! Mexico,"With Mexico rerouting through New Mexico instead of Texas. Hollywood, casinos, all great news for New Mexico. I’ve always been rooting for New Mexico. It needed so much TLC. The little state that could. I hope it begins to thrive, it deserves it, so much positive energy there."
Nailed It! Mexico,"Fight the system?

Nay, leverage and CHANGE the system.

Well done. 👍🏼👍🏼"
Nailed It! Mexico,Nice!
Nailed It! Mexico,"This is amazing news for the tribe and film as a whole. 

I’ve wanted to move to New Mexico for film work for some time from AZ. 

Worried the rates wouldn’t be comparable to my commercial rate here."
Nailed It! Mexico,"Oof. AMC… they’re just rolling the dice a different way. I hope it works out, but an AMC show is either really great, or a huge disappointment."
Nailed It! Mexico,Just watched the trailer. Looks awesome. I think this could be AMCs next big thing. Finally moving away from the Walking Dead/Breaking Bad era. I’ll definitely be watching.
Nailed It! Mexico,"After playing Far Cry 5, and was so enamored with Montana’s scenery that I decided to watch cinema made in Montana. Found only two movies but the scenes and setting were so beautiful that I have a hard time understanding why Montana isn’t a popular film location. 

The entirety of Fargo also makes it really easy to appreciate the biomes of that part of the northernmost US and I would like to see it a lot more than New York or San Francisco."
Nailed It! Mexico,Dark Winds looks alright
Nailed It! Mexico,Getting Hollywood to stop filming in Georgia and move to New Mexico instead is a brilliant move all the way around for everyone.
Nailed It! Mexico,Good for them!
Nailed It! Mexico,"well ,the Seminole own Hard Rock Cafe"
Nailed It! Mexico,Love this
Nailed It! Mexico,"This is a great idea and a boon for the industry as well as the tribe, I think.

So glad to see a business venture moved away from a vice like gambling into something more creative. God bless the Tesuque Purblo people in this endeavor!"
Nailed It! Mexico,"Probably a good investment on their part. With more states taking about legalized gambling and online gambling, Reservation casinos are probably going to see a decline in revenue. Diversification is necessary. I hope it works out for them!"
Nailed It! Mexico,"That’s cool, hope they make some serious money with it"

Nailed It! Mexico,If it's tax exempt then they are assholes
Nailed It! Mexico,Such a brilliant and creative idea. Kudos to them!
Nailed It! Mexico,It’s time!
Nailed It! Mexico,I kinda want them to make a western where every native role is portrayed by actual natives and they cast a bunch of Filipino people to play white people and pretend like its normal
Nailed It! Mexico,Hell yeah!!!!
Nailed It! Mexico,Dark winds looks cool.  Excited to check it out!
Nailed It! Mexico,Saw a dark winds advert today and now I do recall the set and setting was remarkable. Interesting.
Nailed It! Mexico,Amazing
Nailed It! Mexico,Is this all because of Breaking Bad?
Nailed It! Mexico,Didn't Netflix just build a $1 billion filming lot there in Albuquerque?
Nailed It! Mexico,"While this is all true, we've seen this story before. Who knows how long this'll last before the  incentives go away and everyone picks up and leaves."
Nailed It! Mexico,How easy is it to network/get work comparable to LA? About the same?
Nailed It! Mexico,"I’m also in the film industry working out of Atlanta.

Is New Mexico really as booming as they say? Because many productions that I’m aware of that shot there still hired Atlanta crew. So is this influx of productions good for New Mexicans or just good for the productions who want tax breaks."
Nailed It! Mexico,How do rates in New Mexico compare to LA? Considering the move. From AZ. In commercials now
Nailed It! Mexico,I fucking love New Mexico. Favorite state to vist
Nailed It! Mexico,Too bad the tax credits won’t apply…
Nailed It! Mexico,"That area could really use some money. When I was near there, it seemed like everyone had to fight for any kind of work in Los Alamos if they wanted a chance to survive in that area."
Nailed It! Mexico,Indubitably
Nailed It! Mexico,Adding *verisimilitude* to my lexicon.
Nailed It! Mexico,"Yeah, *really* looking forward to this second go-round on the Hillerman series. I remember when *Masterpiece Theatre* on PBS did *Dark Wind* and *Skinwalkers/Thief of Time/Coyote Waits* back in the early '00s (which also had Chris Eyre as a director) when it was Wes Studi and Adam Beach as Leaphorn and Chee."
Nailed It! Mexico,"I agree, shallow and pedantic."

Nailed It! Mexico,"I don’t know what tribe it is in New Mexico, but I know some areas they believe that photos steal the soul. It’s especially in an area between Santa Fe and Albuquerque."
Nailed It! Mexico,"Hopefully it also affords more native actors and native-led productions ability to realize projects, even if the Hollywood engine slows."
Nailed It! Mexico,"I love it. Reservation Dogs, Dark Winds, the movie Prey that's coming out soon. I remember listening to Sterlin Harjo on Tigerbelly talk about how studios were ok with Native stories but wanted white leads (like Red Road, etc). It's about time."
Nailed It! Mexico,"Of course, POS Rick Scott would argue that Georgia is now purple. Which is a beautiful thing."
Nailed It! Mexico,"It's kind of insane how many pieces of media from video games to movies have the Georgia Media logo on them.

Nailed It! Mexico,I fucking hate Skelator. I don’t understand how he beat out Bill Nelson. Didn’t Rick Scott ban any mention of climate change while he was governor? You know the state that is at the most risk of sinking into the ocean?!? (Maybe Louisiana will sink first because it’s constant water level issue)
Nailed It! Mexico,One Florida’s trash is another Georgia’s treasure.. as the saying goes.
Nailed It! Mexico,"It had happened in New Mexico too, NM was courting Hollywood with tax breaks which is why a huge portion of shows and movies were made in the mid-2000s (Breaking Bad, Thor, No Country for Old Men, Little Miss Sunshine), but republican Susana Martinez got rid of all of them and almost burnt entirely the Hollywood relationship. The only reason Breaking Bad kept filming was the because the setting of Albuquerque was way too well established. Eventually the massive loss of revenue as well it being a deeply unpopular decision made Martinez reverse the decision (and dubbed it the Breaking Bad rule, that idiot) and initially I was worried the industry wouldn’t ever come back but it’s nice to see that it’s been forgiven somewhat."
Nailed It! Mexico,That and you would hard pressed to find a blank acre of Florida anymore to shoot anything. We are so overpopulated. It sucks because Florida has so many cool places and if it was only preserved to benefit the movie industry at least it would be preserved.
Nailed It! Mexico,"I moved to New Mexico less than two years ago. It really is a nice, interesting state. It has huge honking crime and poverty issues, but hopefully those will improve."
Nailed It! Mexico,"It’ll be interesting to see how much New Mexico grows and changes from all this.  To me New Mexico is Albuquerque, Santa Fe, Las Vegas, and road construction.  So I’d like to see more stuff but still spread out when passing through.  Maybe even stay longer next time."
Nailed It! Mexico,Natives know fighting the system doesn't always work *see natives when it comes to everything when dealing with the US Gov* but finding and leveraging an exploit is a great way to combat the system.
Nailed It! Mexico,All I need is better call saul
Nailed It! Mexico,I really liked Longmire and I'm hoping this scratches that itch of wanting more (and I think there's a very good chance of it)
Nailed It! Mexico,"There isn’t shit in Montana, that’s why. I don’t mean that as an insult - Montana’s one of the prettiest places in the United States. But a big reason Georgia has seen a big boom in film production over the last fifteen years is due to the ease of moving around. A production can situate itself in Atlanta, but twenty minutes or less outside the city, you’re in small town America if you need that. You can be in the sticks in less than an hour. There are freeways aplenty to make navigating these disparate locations easy, as well. Similar for Northern Ireland on the Europe side - headquarter production in Belfast, you can find beaches, woods, farms, etc. less than an hour away if that’s what your production requires.

Montana, by contrast, is almost entirely rural. The biggest city in the state is Billings, which has just over 100K people. The top five cities in the state do not equal the population of Atlanta, for comparison. Any story that requires a dense urban center couldn’t convincingly find one there. Even shooting in downtown Billings would have mountains and lush green prominently in the background. Then there’s the weather, which is brutal. It’s *cold* in Montana for most of the year. Like even in summer, it gets frigid. You’re lucky if you get two months that feel like a summer there some years. That’s not mentioning the rain, thunder storms, and wildfires. Poor weather is a big deterrent for film productions, as they work long hours and need dependable conditions.

Unless it is something with a huge budget or an acclaimed filmmaker behind it, the trick to filming location for most things is finding somewhere close to an urban epicenter (which can provide set space) that has a surrounding area that can pass for rural if necessary. Montana, much as I love it, doesn’t have so many of the ingredients necessary to have a streamlined, smooth production. A lot of money would have to be spent setting up a production there, and since there isn’t an industry there in the first place, that means you’re burning a lot of cash you could save filming in other places. I imagine tax incentives are another part of it, as many others have mentioned in this thread."
Nailed It! Mexico,Why is that?
Nailed It! Mexico,About that whole “reservations in Georgia” thing…
Nailed It! Mexico,"It almost always does on reservation property. There are no property rights or recourse when contracts are violated. That's why no one builds houses on reservations, even though you could."
Nailed It! Mexico,"Wrong AMC. AMC the channel is owned by AMC Networks, but AMC Theaters is a different company.

Both are publicly traded"
Nailed It! Mexico,"From article:

>Because the Tesuque land is its own nation, productions that shoot here are not eligible for New Mexico’s tax incentives"
Nailed It! Mexico,You really have a problem with natives using tax exemptions to make money? Isn't that like the least we owe them?
Nailed It! Mexico,That’s literally one of the reasons they have reservations
Nailed It! Mexico,Damn how dare people who's land was stolen and ancestors were brutalized and murdered not pay taxes
Nailed It! Mexico,"We literally genocide them. 

It’s the least they deserve."
Nailed It! Mexico,You seem upset. Guess they’re just better business people than you are.
Nailed It! Mexico,Damn you got owned!!!
Nailed It! Mexico,"A lot of sci-fi opportunities there as well. A very wide range of natural scenery that isn’t congested with people, the weather is consistent, it’s got a great spooky, otherworldly vibe but it’s versatile and could mimic a lot of other places with few tweaks. These are a few geographical reasons it would be ideal. I’m sure there are a plethora of financial positives as that is usually the kicker."
Nailed It! Mexico,I thought it was due to the tax rebates?
Nailed It! Mexico,Little miss sunshine.
Nailed It! Mexico,Basically every Western you've ever seen has at least some scenes filmed in New Mexico.
Nailed It! Mexico,BB and BCS
Nailed It! Mexico,"Used to be state sponsored tax incentives (I wanna say it was around 30% of the budget?) luring studios to shoot there (that’s why you see tons of shows shot in Georgia or Canada (- the “made in georgia” logo at the end credits is a requirement of the tax rebate) if the rebate is significant enough, studios will come and shoot - but imho for these policies to actually work in the long run, you need to mandate a threshold of local hires/local spend and min% of actual production taking place within the state to trigger the rebates - I assume that’s still the case?  But to your point, I feel like breaking bad helped foster a skilled production labor pool, which is vital (along with incentives, facilities, etc) in building a lasting entertainment production economy in NM. Remember a metric shit ton of reality shows from Alaska?  Shortly after deadliest catch came out they started offering filming incentives (At one point, there were over 20 shows shooting there at the same time. ) - AK repealed the incentive laws because they didn’t really mandate local hires - it was just a bunch of people being flown in to make the shows and the state didn’t see any immediate financial benefit after doing it for a bunch of years -  studios naturally saw it as a n easy way to save tons of money for dirt cheap content (no unions either) so Alaska ended up sending tons of money out of state for what amounted to a glorified tourism campaign and a giveaway for Discovery, et al."
Nailed It! Mexico,"It's the other way around. 

NM has had production tax incentives for a long time now. Breaking Bad was originally set in LA, but they rewrote it as Albuquerque for this very reason."
Nailed It! Mexico,"Yep, the film industry is practically booming here now and it’s awesome"
Nailed It! Mexico,North Carolina here. I concur
Nailed It! Mexico,"Things are really spread out and open here, so the drive would likely be longer... but there's next to zero traffic ever, even during rush hours, so it probably evens out time-wise but is a nicer drive here than in LA."
Nailed It! Mexico,"The lack of local below the line workers is a problem. I'm currently on the statewide curriculum development committee for the governor's Next Generation Media Academy. Combined with the state's Opportunity Scholarship, it's going to be possible for anyone in NM to go to college (anywhere in the state) for one year for free, and be trained to work on sets. IATSE and the state film office are helping place everyone who goes through the program in a paid summer on-set internship. It will take a few years, but I think it's a good plan for developing local set labor."
Nailed It! Mexico,ABQ is an absolute playground. There is so much to do. Outdoor activities out the wazoo. Cool and unique restaurants. Live music in old town. All that and character to boot. Not to mention all the art spaces.
Nailed It! Mexico,Hopefully they can get work in Non-union shoots. With non union or their own union and tax exemptions this plan will get more productions and jobs to the reservation
Nailed It! Mexico,Perchance.
Nailed It! Mexico,Forsooth
Nailed It! Mexico,It's a good word.
Nailed It! Mexico,Adding lexicon to my wordy-bank.
Nailed It! Mexico,"Use *verisimilitude*

Thanks Professor!"
Nailed It! Mexico,"""In an effort to *expand* my vocabulary, every day I learn a new word that will help to increase the verisimilitude of my arguments.  Anyway, today's word is 'expand'."""
Nailed It! Mexico,"Double click the word, right click ""Google 'this word'""."
Nailed It! Mexico,"Whatever the truth of that is, I feel very confident that that doesn't apply to this group."
Nailed It! Mexico,If the tribe believed that they wouldn't convert the casino into a film studio then.
Nailed It! Mexico,Really? I always heard that belief associated with indigenous Australians.
Disappearance,"My concern is what happens to the library content as it ages. I think a lot people, including myself, were operating under a naive assumption that everything they ever made would be accessible forever on their platforms, but I don't think we can count on that."
Disappearance,"In 2009, Amreeka debuted at Sundance to praise and ended up with an 87% Rotten Tomatos score. It's a rare look into the lives of Palestinians in the West Bank and in the United States that's not a gut wrenching documentary or thriller. It's a comedy, and a good one.

Nat Geo bought the rights to it after Sundance, and just shelved it. Not available to watch on any platform. If you want to see it, and it's good, you have no choice but to find a DVD copy somewhere."
Disappearance,"There are tons and tons of shows that were on networks that you can't find anywhere. This is nothing new.

I just tried to look up ""Cavemen"" with Nick Kroll and it's nowhere to be found. That aired on ABC.

There was a show that Lee Aronsohn did before Two and Half Men called ""Life... and Stuff"", starring a stand-up comedian named Rick Reynolds and Pam Dawber. It's nowhere to be found. That aired on CBS.

There was a show called ""Nurses"" that had TV writer Brent Forrester (The Simpsons, King of the Hill, The Office) on staff (although he never was assigned a script and doesn't have a credit). Nowhere to be found.

Margaret Cho's ""All-American Girl."" You can find DVDs and grainy episodes on YouTube... not on any streaming platform.

Jon Stewart's MTV talk show. Nowhere to be found.

Late Night with David Letterman... outside of clips and a handful of full episodes on a superfan's YouTube account... nowhere to be found.

Countless others."
Disappearance,"aint nothing disapearing from my plex server

once again the black flag is better"
Disappearance,"The tax break thing is deeply concerning, it feels like a sequel to The Producers. ""Did you know you can make more money by making a movie and canning it forever than actually releasing it?"" 

I know asking corporations to do anything fair with taxes is like screaming into the void but it feels like this loophole needs to be closed."
Disappearance,Cue a group of filmmakers creating their own streaming platform.
Disappearance,"I know everyone's just talking about stuff being pulled, but... what a weird article.

It reads as if it's about to go in-depth on the trend, like maybe how certain creatives don't want to work with certain companies anymore, or how something not being publicly released makes it harder for people breaking in / with few credits to point to their previous work when trying to get the next job (I have first-hand experience here).

And then it's just a couple quotes from Johnson and Bruckheimer before abruptly ending."
Disappearance,No offense but this happened all the time in the age before DVDs.
Disappearance,Like it wasn't normal on linear TV and still is.
Disappearance,I'm still waiting on *Counterparts* to land somewhere.
Disappearance,"Can I just say that I love my dvd collection? Everybody thought I was crazy to hang on to them. But I just love the physical nature of them. Yes, they take up a lot of room. But if I suddenly decide I have a burning desire to see the all time classic masterpiece 'The Librarian. Quest for the spear.' 
I can. And that makes me happy."
Disappearance,The golden age was when Netflix had everything.
Disappearance,"Every time I see “streamers”, I think of streamers on Twitch, not streaming websites. I got worried that streamers were deleting the old saved videos when I first read the headline."
Disappearance,I’m *horrified* that I can’t watch all the old WKRP episodes with the original music. That is truly a loss.
Disappearance,"This isn't really surprising.  For a couple years, every piece of garbage got greenlit because of ""we need content!""  Some of that garbage is literally unwatchable.  The industry is getting more discerning."
Disappearance,"That’s fair to say but losing money is also terrible for the streamers and the studios who own most of them. It’s a two-way street. 

The days, heck years, of streamers being financially irresponsible by ordering tons of content, most of which are mediocre anyway, seem to be over. At the end of the day, it’s always best to focus on quality over quantity."
Disappearance,"As opposed to traditional linear TV or movie theater model where content disappeared forever by design due to being limited by time slots? Or the old movie rental model where your selection was limited to what could fit shelves at your local Blockbuster?

I don't understand their argument against streaming. Streaming is just a more convenient rental business but still has the same inherit problems that rentals always had. 

If anything can be considered terrible is that we can't purchase digital ""hard copies"" of much of this content any more like when everything came out on VHS/DVD/Blu-Ray and are left to piracy as the only option to acquire removed content."
Disappearance,"How long before its just 45 episodes of an ass farting, replaced every 3 months so noone knows who's ass it is and why it is farting!?"
Disappearance,"But it's always been like that see Babylon 2022

Movies like tooth paste cars or toilet paper can be discontinued.

Think of the Firebird car.


Great but hey... Costs verses sales"
Disappearance,Get a dvd player and start collecting DVDs and box sets of particularly good shows and movies. It’ll be worth it in the long run
Disappearance,"> Creatives are burning with rage over Hollywood’s hottest new trend: **streaming platforms’ habit of canceling finished films and TV series before they’ve aired or pulling projects from platforms and shelving them indefinitely.**

> The Hollywood Reporter has been asking around about the effects of consolidation, budget cuts and tax write-offs kneecapping projects like Batgirl, Snowpiercer, Scoob!: Holiday Haunt and Westworld, among others. **It’s happening all over town as entertainment companies have been forced to contend with consolidation, inflation, a possible recession and a constant chase for subscribers.**

> “It’s been horrifying,” prolific creator Rian Johnson (Glass Onion) tells THR. “The fact that it’s becoming common practice is terrible and adds to the awfulness. In the history of the business, there has been a constant evolution of horrible things.”"
Disappearance,"""Horrifying""? Guys relax"
Disappearance,"I don’t understand the backlash honestly. Studios are not art galleries.  They’re making products.  All these creators can go make whatever they want and distribute it on their own if they want.  There’s never been a time as good as this for creators.

If a studio decides to pull a product because it’s unprofitable or they just decide it doesn’t work, well… isn’t that the business they’re in?"
Disappearance,It's hard to get excited for anything on streaming if half of the announced projects never launch and the ones that do get cancelled as soon as there's trouble.
Disappearance,The fact Rian Johnson ruined Star Wars is more terrible....
Disappearance,"I guess I'm confused. Do they think companies are going to keep willingly losing money for shit? Even Disney will change their tune when they lose enough. Eventually, people are going to have to start making their own stuff. Tiktok allows 8 minute videos. When people get passed silly dance trends and start making their own short films and stuff, the industry changes,"
Disappearance,"Responds smugly with my disc collection. 

Realise I have no television just movies. :("
Disappearance,HORRIFYING
Disappearance,People were always worried about this happening with Steam.
Disappearance,"Fucking agreed. Have been saying this for so long, it's nice and convenient but we can't actually own anything on streaming sites, not having dvd or bluray releases really hurts the people creating the movoes or tv shows, the fans as well, in the long run vecause their work gets erased and for the fans, we lose all of thise badass stories we've seen and loved."
Disappearance,"I love physical media for the exact reasons about what's happening, but it's worse now more than ever to protect things you love in a tangible manner: With streamers so intent on getting you to subscribe it has become exclusive media and now that we've seen nothing lasts forever, something we might've loved could be gone in the blink of an eye from history. A prime example for me is one day not being able to watch Love Death + Robots. *“It’s always about the work, and if the work’s good, it’ll be on the air. That’s how it works.""* This quote from Jerry Bruckheimer in the article scares me the most, it's a faith in that ideology that is incredibly misguided at this point: There are plenty of things we love that would be considered obscure and are more than good, sometimes works of art, but these companies don't care about *good work* anymore - just eyeballs on any given project. Everything can inform or inspire a generation that it didn't before, but we'll never know what could've happened if it's gone."
Disappearance,Just do how we did back in the days! Screw these entertainment conglomerates
Disappearance,Micheal cera with dad body?
Disappearance,"I'm not sure many people read the article. Almost all the comments are talking about removing things from an existing catalogue, which is ofc a big problem with streaming services, but the article's about cancelling things before release.

I don't think canceling projects midway is a new problem but it definitely seems like a bigger issue now and, unlike removing existing films/TV from a library, it's not something piracy can fix."
Disappearance,"Crave HBO. Boardwalk Empire? C’mon? U raised $ 3x since 2020 (well 2x,actually after promotion ended, but still. Wtf?  Hopped on the Snyder cut train. )"
Disappearance,Physical media will always be king.
Disappearance,"Man, the anime crowd has been on this tip for the last 30 years."
Disappearance,"I’m not hugely concerned because streaming is still relatively new as a business model. We’re going through a contraction of the industry, but they’ll be available in some capacity as long as there’s demand for it."
Disappearance,There are too many platforms and too many shows. We really need a big culling to make it more manageable.
Disappearance,Corporate profits above all else applies to everything from the shrinkage of food charging the same for less to the entertainment industry catalogues so they don't have to pay residuals. It's all absolute greed more is never enough.
Disappearance,"I think this snuck up on people,  and going forward filmmakers and actors will have a clause in the contract that says if it does not air within a certain timeframe, or with a certain frequency, the rights will revert to the filmmaker. That doesn’t necessarily mean it will be seen somewhere but people with the clout are going to want clauses that will keep their work from being lost or hidden"
Disappearance,Star Wars Episode 8 was horrifying.
Disappearance,"According to some people on here, it’s not a big deal because it’s always happened"
Disappearance,"It’s weird. Shows like Stargate SG-1 is just not available for streaming (at least in my country). I thought after Amazon bought it, but now it’s been a year and still nothing. 

It should be legal to pirate if they don’t even want to make it accessible for purchase."
Disappearance," Arr Arr, Pirates we! Treasure on the web arr fer free!"
Disappearance,That's why at this rate I actually prefer streaming sites just to do a limited miniseries.
Disappearance,"Loosing media is nothing new, how many TV shows and movies from the 50s-80s are lost media due to things like master tapes being destroyed, lost, etc.  Not to mention books going out of print. It’s OK guys - it was never made to be forever. Enjoy these things while you can, but they don’t really matter in the long run. You can always find something new to discover- I promise."
Disappearance,[deleted]
Disappearance,Everything is for sale. Tough luck. Capitalism is as inevitable as Thanos. What’s the solution?
Disappearance,"This is how they’ll milk that old cow, my 10 y/o kids will be paying someone to stream their favorite childhood content 30 years from now.."
Disappearance,"This is why I won't invest my time in watching ongoing series on Netflix. Because they cancel them without warning and without resolution.

If Netflix guaranteed series finales... for shows with 3 or more seasons for example... I would be happy to watch."
Disappearance,This is one of many reasons streaming is bad. Pirating and physical media is the only way to guarantee the ability to watch content.
Disappearance,"This is the result of Hollywood unions forcing residuals on the studios. 

Streamers would rather not deal with all that and just remove the content from the platform if the shows don't generate enough money."
Disappearance,So Westworld is just gone. I watched Seasons 1-3 but never season 4 and now I can never watch it. Who made this call.
Disappearance,Rian: “Its really bad. BTW catch my new show on Peacock and my upcoming movie on Netflix!”
Disappearance,Anything with Michael Cera that disappears forever is okay with me.
Disappearance,Someone tell Rian Johnson the streaming providers are just subverting expectations.
Disappearance,Rian Johnson would know since he made Star Wars disappear from Pop Culture.
Disappearance,This is about $$$ - Rian and Jerry are just pissed their royalties cheques are getting smaller.
Disappearance,"Are you a bank or a studio? Yeah, I get you want to make money, but if that’s all, just become a bank. If you want to be a studio, put out some films."
Disappearance,I stopped buying physical media because I couldn’t stand the clutter anymore and donated it all. But my itunes library has about 1800 movies and some of my favorite Tv shows. I don’t watch tv shows much
Disappearance,"If you are able to gatekeep some content than you will be able to do it for any content. 
This is gradually happening since acta couldn’t been passed. 
  Lucky us that “they” want and need what they try to refuse to every other clear-net user : privacy and security. So while they have it we will have it ( privacy and security) , albeit it’s an individual task to accomplish nowadays in regards with “them”"
Disappearance,"I find it really hard to care about that. It's extremely easy to find content you want, download it, and keep it in a hard drive. It's almost impossible for modern content to be lost."
Disappearance,The fact that Rian Johnson is still allowed to make movies is perplexing
Disappearance,"The same happens with music. I had an artist’s album on Apple Music one time and the other day when I wanted to give it a “spin”, it was no longer there.

It took me a 1/2 hour to dig up the CD from storage too. 👎🏻"
Disappearance,"So they’re just like regular Hollywood. There are lots of examples of older properties that have more content that after airing once are never seen again or were never released for sale in the physical or digital. If it’s not guaranteed to make enough to buy a yacht in these modern times, being available or released is not always going to be a reality."
Disappearance,I have been looking for HBO “Dream On” forever.
Disappearance,"The part I hate the most is that it's totally possible and fine to tell an entire story, beginning-middle-*end* in a single season, but nooooo. Gotta leave hanging threads or just have a straight cliffhanger in case it takes off and they want to extend it into multiple seasons. I wish more TV would just show a small, self-contained story and forgo all the serial stuff that has become so ubiquitous.  
  
Edit: Ahh. We're talking stuff removed from streaming services, not canceled shows. OOps.."
Disappearance,Can you imagine Scrubs just.....going away? I need to look to a bay with pirates soon.
Disappearance,Arrrrgh ye scallywags must raise the black flag
Disappearance,This is one of the reasons why physical media still needs to be around.
Disappearance,"Thing is, we're paying for these shows and movies twice now.  Once with our cable/streaming bills, and now Hollywood is double dipping by getting tax breaks for their expensive failures.

Hollywood is full of multi millionaires that take credit for other people's work and blame others for their own failures. It's amazing how the boomers are so thrilled with such an ass backwards system of worth and value."
Disappearance,"I don't know why people look at me like I'm from Mars when I talk about this. Fine, use ""the cloud"" for backup and you exchange information, but keep your movies. Keep your music. Keep your family photos. To be dependent exclusively on some corporation keeping things running, holding up their end of the deal, not wrong writing the fine print to solely benefit them and not protect you, is preposterous. Is YOUR data. Keep it."
Disappearance,"So the actors and anyone who receives residual payments from TV and Film are being snubbed because streaming services: 

A. Are beholden to shareholders and constant quarterly growth. 

B. Overspent on productions and need to reel in spending.

C. Are adding commercials but commercial profits are not offsetting anything cause shareholders need money. 

D. Are canceling shows after 2-3 seasons to keep cultivating super watched, (culturally talked about) shows to draw new viewers (accounts) to satiate shareholders. 


The best thing consumers can do is watch the shows they want then abruptly cancel until there shows season is back on."
Disappearance,"The general public is dumping services they don’t use… it’s very easy to do. This is the nightmare scenario that they’ve been dreading sing everyone dumped cable services that could lock you in for years … 

I see big changes and more acquisitions on The horizon … look out for apple to buy a major player… thinking Sony … maybe Universal.  And of course Warner Bros is perpetually for sale . It’s all funny math."
Disappearance,"There's lots of old HBO stuff that isn't on their streaming service. That was going to be one of the big draws for me, getting access to some of the stuff they made back in the 70s and 80s when it was still kind of an underground thing and they were getting weird with it.

Barring that, how about a full set of the One Night Stands they made back then? So many comedians who later made it big, those old standup sets are fun to see.

That stuff must just be sitting in their vaults, probably never to be seen again. I have to assume a lot of what they're making now, the same thing will happen."
Disappearance,"I've come to that realization as well, there's already films and TV shows from the 90s/00s that can't be found anywhere online, stuff I assumed would be around forever in some form. Arrested Development is the latest casualty, Netflix is losing the rights, hopefully another service picks it up, but what about shows that can't find a new home online? They're just gone. Makes me wish I had hung onto more of my DVDs."
Disappearance,"Before streaming thousands of shows got cancelled and they disapperead into the ether.  Series having proper endings and being able to watch is largely something fairly  new actually new to this century.  There's probably more shows now that survive a second life on streaming that would have just been plum forgotten by all but a handful of people had they existed 15-20 years earlier.  For example the Series  Big Wave Dave's was created  by  2 people who were showrunners for the Series Mash and also wrote a bunch of episodes of Cheers. It was cancelled after 6 episodes in the early 90's and dissapeared into the ether despite fairly noteworthy showrunners and 2 notable tv actor(adam arkin,kurtwood smith). Had it existed 2 decades later it would have been streamed somewhere and been allowed to existed beyond the initial few weeks it airred  on tv."
Disappearance,"Yeah, it seems like they see more profit in selling their shows to other platforms after a while... hopefully this could also mean they might consider blu-ray releases... the only way to truly own something..."
Disappearance,Over the last few years I've gone back to buying Blu rays just because I've lost trust in everything being available to me. The problem is fewer and fewer shows end up on Blu ray
Disappearance,or what heppenes when one of the services goes bankrupt
Disappearance,"That's kind of how it was sold to us tbh. ""The whole Paramount catalog on Paramount+!"" For example. They don't mention ""Until we stop paying for the licensing.""

What they should do is, when a series etc. Is due to go off the platform, add a ""Buy Blu-ray"" button. Then they just charge your card and ship it out to you. The caveat there is that it does take away some ability to lure people back to their platform if it returns, but I imagine not everyone would bother to buy the disc media anyway."
Disappearance,"Imagine that you are in some place in the time, 10 or 15 years ago. That is the same problem with a lot of movies and shows but is not for streaming, is because there are no stock or phisical version.

So... what is the diference?"
Disappearance,"Yes, that was very naive."
Disappearance,you know where stuff doesn't disappear and it's actually well kept? Piracy sites.
Disappearance,🏴‍☠️🏴‍☠️🏴‍☠️
Disappearance,*Cough* pirating *cough*
Disappearance,"As long as platforms have to pay to keep something on their catalog, they have no reason to do so eternally if it's profitable. The shows that are removed aren't (not watched enough compared to their licensing costs). That's the logical assumption, the other was just some misplaced hope not understanding how business works."
Disappearance,Piracy
Disappearance,"Just like projects being pulled, this has always happened and the only difference is visibility. We're more aware of it happening because things that were accessible to us are removed when in the past they just quietly disappeared from shelves and future projects get more publicity because it's a way to get people to subscribe for the upcoming stuff.

Calling it the ""hottest trend"", ""horrifying"" and a ""terrible practice"" as if it hasn't been part of the business forever is just ridiculous"
Disappearance,"That’s remains my expectation. FOMO/vault strategies will get me to cancel. I was planning to resub to HBO for Last of Us, and the last 2 seasons of Westworld were part of my plan. Can’t watch that, and the service doesn’t have enough value for one active episode I care about a week. Didn’t resubscribe, and probably won’t until at least two seasons of TLOU are up. Needs to be worth the $15-30, and that’s not even close."
Disappearance,"I went looking for some older war movies (battle of Britain, bridge too far, etc.) and I came to the conclusion I’m gonna have to get a DVD player and buy the DVDs if I want to watch them without ads or rent them every time."
Disappearance,"I've never believed in the notion that you don't need to buy anything in physical form or download it to your own storage since there are so many streaming platforms and ""you could access anything at any time"". And now it's becoming more ans more evident that it's not true at all and you don't actually own the content even if you pay a mounthly fee."
Disappearance,I remember my first day on the internet...
Disappearance,Is there something like a Svalbard Seed Vault for films and series? I wonder...
Disappearance,Ugh this is such a good movie
Disappearance,"Any chance rights were bought with the full intention to ""make it disappear?""  or is that conspiracy theory BS?"
Disappearance,[deleted]
Disappearance,I’m sure I can find it in about 5 minutes sailing the high seas
Disappearance,I'm still trying to track down The John Larroquette Show. It runs Sundays on RewindTV but I can't seem to find complete seasons streaming anywhere or on DVD.
Lego Friends: Girls on a Mission,It aired in the UK on ITV in December but this is its first run in the US. MGM+ are obviously just rolling it out weekly. Come back in a months time and it will all be there as it was a six episode long series.
Lego Friends: Girls on a Mission,It’s on the MGM+ subscription via Prime video.  I am subscriber to MGM+ and the whole series (6 episodes) is available to watch.  Hope this clarifies.
Lego Friends: Girls on a Mission,Show's two weeks into the six week run on MGM+. It's the same access cable VoD and the Epix streaming app (provider login access to MGM+ streaming) have.
Lego Friends: Girls on a Mission,"Amazon sent me... 

Just tried watching episode 3 and now I have to wait... fml. This show is soooooooo damn good"
Lego Friends: Girls on a Mission,"This makes sense to me, they might as well milk it. Thanks for the reply"
Lego Friends: Girls on a Mission,"Thats so weird, I wonder why I have no option to play episodes 3-6. Are you in the U.S.?"
Lego Friends: Girls on a Mission,"Ah, okay gotcha. Good to know the rest will be trickled out because I am thoroughly enjoying it so far. Thanks for the reply!"
Lego Friends: Girls on a Mission,"Haha, welcome to the struggle!"
Lego Friends: Girls on a Mission,"I'm in the process of leaving Mormonism. It's pretty believable given the geographic location, the time period, and Mormon culture.

You also have the fact that the parents were both fucking this guy and were accomplices to him abusing their daughter."
Lego Friends: Girls on a Mission,The real story is insane. >!Both parents offered their kid up like a lamb to slaughter… BECAUSE THEY BOTH WERE FUCKING THE KIDNAPPER. Both. Parents. Had sexual relations. With the kidnapper.!<
Lego Friends: Girls on a Mission,Eyy it’s plop
Lego Friends: Girls on a Mission,Something about Jake Lacy's face terrifies the absolute shit out of me.
Lego Friends: Girls on a Mission,He was so loveable in Obvious Child but every other role I've seen him in he's so creepy. Even as Hannah's boyfriend on Girls.
Lego Friends: Girls on a Mission,I remember when the Netflix documentary came out and my coworkers were all talking about it and I straight up didn’t believe them. The story is absolutely insane. So I watched the show and just got more and more angry as it progressed because of how incompetent the parents were.
Lego Friends: Girls on a Mission,Once you learn this happened within the Mormon community it makes a lot more sense.
Lego Friends: Girls on a Mission,"> In Peacock’s A Friend of the Family, Jake Lacy plays Bob “B” Berchtold, a man who befriends a Midwestern Mormon family in the 1970s, only to kidnap their young daughter Jan not just once, but twice. It would be an unbelievable story if it weren’t true: Jan Broberg’s story was previously chronicled in the 2017 documentary Abducted in Plain Sight.


> For Lacy, playing a kidnapper and pedophile was an emotional challenge for the actor, particularly given the ages of his victim: Jan was 12 and 14 when she was kidnapped. Hendrix Yancey, now 11, and Mckenna Grace, 16, play Jan at the different ages, while the real Jan Broberg and her mother, Mary Ann, were often on set as they served as producers on the limited series. 


> “It’s so selfless for them to say, ‘We want this story told so that people understand what grooming and coercion and manipulation look like,’ ” Lacy tells THR about getting the Brobergs’ blessing. “And understand that we didn’t get to 1985 and this stopped. It’s still widely prevalent today, and it most often happens at the hands of someone you know and love and trust. That’s why it’s so incredibly difficult to talk about and to prosecute.”"
Lego Friends: Girls on a Mission,I remember this case. IIRC the kidnapper was sleeping with both  of the kidnapped girl’s parents.
Lego Friends: Girls on a Mission,Didn’t Netflix do a doc about this?
Lego Friends: Girls on a Mission,"Jake lacy is good. He just. Sweet nice guy in High Fidelity, absolute asshole rich dude in White Lotus… really masters the white dude range"
Lego Friends: Girls on a Mission,"Mckenna Grace noted that, as someone who's developed a reputation for playing younger versions of main characters, she now has her own younger version.

She's been very good in the other stuff I've seen her in - how she is in this?"
Lego Friends: Girls on a Mission,That’s Plop
Lego Friends: Girls on a Mission,Funny story: I watched the movie 'Abducted in Plain Sight' on a date.
Lego Friends: Girls on a Mission,Mokuba has entered the chat
Lego Friends: Girls on a Mission,Good to see Plop having some good success out there.
Lego Friends: Girls on a Mission,Jake Lacy……ssswwwwoooooonnn
Lego Friends: Girls on a Mission,"Does anyone know if the phone recordings on the Abducted in Plain Sight doc are real? The one were Jan calls from the boarding school telling her parents she's fine and she loves them while giggling at them nearly in tears freaked me the fuck out. And then the end of the call where the parents are like well ok bye, our daughter who has been kidnapped, call more often, 'Kay? 😬"
Lego Friends: Girls on a Mission,"[Jan Broberg Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jan_Broberg_Felt)

From Wikipedia 
Broberg was kidnapped when she was twelve,[3] and again when she was fourteen, both times by Robert Berchtold,[11][12][13] a friend of the family, who had sexual encounters with both parents.[3][14] On October 30, 2003, she and her mother Mary Ann published a heavily redacted book titled Stolen Innocence: The Jan Broberg Story which completely omitted her father's sexual involvement with the perpetrator.[15][16] Broberg's story was the feature of the true crime documentary Abducted in Plain Sight. Filmed and produced over a three-year period, it was released in January 2019.[17] Robert Berchtold died by suicide in 2005.[18][19]"
Lego Friends: Girls on a Mission,it really came down to both of her parents being complete idiots.
Lego Friends: Girls on a Mission,Is that Plop?
Lego Friends: Girls on a Mission,Is that Plop?
Lego Friends: Girls on a Mission,Ok but the use of quotation marks in tis headline confused the fuck out of me at first glance
Lego Friends: Girls on a Mission,Good ole Plop
Lego Friends: Girls on a Mission,"I started watching this show and … I just couldn’t finish because I couldn’t believe this would ever actually happen. I kept waiting for that “Lifetime” moment where the parents go into attack mode and do everything they can to protect their kid, but nope… episode 3, I think it was, this man was still in their house. Smdfh."
Lego Friends: Girls on a Mission,Gross that they’re using this for entertainment - I hope the girl agreed to let them do this.
Lego Friends: Girls on a Mission,He looks like twin brother of Mark Zuckenberg
Lego Friends: Girls on a Mission,The difference between a class system and a cast system is that a class system doesn’t discriminate.
Lego Friends: Girls on a Mission,Isn’t that Plop from The Office?
Lego Friends: Girls on a Mission,I wish they'd gone into the guilt of the Mormon church when it comes to this case.  They knew exactly who he was and what he was doing and allowed it to continue.  I think they're actually more at fault than the parents (who at least have the excuse that they were manipulated over a long period of time).  If you read up into what the church knew and ignored it's shocking.
Lego Friends: Girls on a Mission,"Omg I remember reading comments from former Mormons and they're like, ""I know it all sounds crazy and I can't explain it myself but their story sounds really typical Mormon - all their actions and behaviors are the most Mormon things I've ever heard."" And I'm like.... how many Mormons are sleeping with pedophiles and giving their children away to pedophiles to be sexually assaulted??????"
Lego Friends: Girls on a Mission,Glad to hear your shelf broke. Congratulations on starting your life on the outside.
Lego Friends: Girls on a Mission,"> the parents were both fucking this guy 

God, the trailer for this show creeped me out so, so bad that I knew I was going to give it a hard pass no matter how good it was but now this…? BOTH her parents were sleeping with him? What did that innocent girl do to be born into this evil hellscape of an environment?"
Lego Friends: Girls on a Mission,It’s fucking unbelievable. Her parents were literally some of the dumbest people I’ve ever seen.
Lego Friends: Girls on a Mission,"Wasn’t this a Netflix or HBO doc?

I swear because dude asked the dad for a handjob(the husband knew dude was sleeping with his wife too at the time) or something and went through with doing it because reasons."
Lego Friends: Girls on a Mission,"Wasn't this the story gave the guy a handjob in a car because he ""needed a release""?"
Lego Friends: Girls on a Mission,"I’m confused because Jan is still talking & worked with her mother on this. Wouldn’t you not want to talk or be near the person who partook in your kidnapping?

The site is bugging out on me if it’s in the article"
Lego Friends: Girls on a Mission,"and for further clarification, the parents were fucking the kidnapper independently of each other.  it wasn't a threesome situation, he seduced them both separately, all whilst diddling the kid.  he somehow brainwashed nearly the entire family to fuck him."
Lego Friends: Girls on a Mission,Wow. That’s “Nearly Unbelievable”!
Lego Friends: Girls on a Mission,"The miniseries made it appear as though the sexual relationship between the father and the stalker was a one-time, almost involuntary incident."
Lego Friends: Girls on a Mission,Anyone know if it's part of the show? I know the family are producers so I'm wondering how much they get into it.
Lego Friends: Girls on a Mission,The documentary was INSANE
Lego Friends: Girls on a Mission,Mormons.
Lego Friends: Girls on a Mission,Why was his name plop?
Lego Friends: Girls on a Mission,I’ll never forgive him for taking Erin away from Andy!!
Lego Friends: Girls on a Mission,[deleted]
Lego Friends: Girls on a Mission,I liked him in the office but after seeing him in white lotus I feel like he will make a much better bad guy and now it’s all I can see. Something about him is just sinister lol.
Lego Friends: Girls on a Mission,He looks like he's going to go on to play a lot of bureaucrats and politicians in supporting roles.
Lego Friends: Girls on a Mission,he reminds me of Nicholas Hoult
Lego Friends: Girls on a Mission,He got Tom Cruise eyes.
Lego Friends: Girls on a Mission,He had the perfect look of a borderline personality disorder case.
Lego Friends: Girls on a Mission,Then you should check out Significant Other
Lego Friends: Girls on a Mission,And yet it's not nearly as disturbing as your face.
Lego Friends: Girls on a Mission,He was great in White Lotus partially because of this imo
Lego Friends: Girls on a Mission,"He’s not really creepy in The White Lotus, just an asshole"
Lego Friends: Girls on a Mission,"He was very charming as the love interest in High Fidelity, but I think I’m the only person in the world who watched that. xD"
Lego Friends: Girls on a Mission,He's not creepy on the Office.
Lego Friends: Girls on a Mission,Very surprised Jan is still even talking to her mom given everything.
Lego Friends: Girls on a Mission,crazy that they consider Idaho “midwestern”
Lego Friends: Girls on a Mission,Yes they did - Abducted in Plain Sight.
Lego Friends: Girls on a Mission,Peacock has a doc about it
Lego Friends: Girls on a Mission,"He was great in High Fidelity, but then again, most of the cast was. What a miss on not giving that show another season."
Lego Friends: Girls on a Mission,He’s also really good in the Showtime show ‘I’m Dying Up Here’
Lego Friends: Girls on a Mission,Phenomenal. She brought me to tears many times.
Lego Friends: Girls on a Mission,"Both of the young actors did a fantastic job.  Amazing, both of them."
Lego Friends: Girls on a Mission,"She's the best young actor working atm, in my opinion. Her performance in Gifted was stupidly good, as in a ""you can retire now"" level of good."
Lego Friends: Girls on a Mission,*That's* how I know him!!
Lego Friends: Girls on a Mission,I can't verify if the recordings were real or reenactments.  But we do know the FBI was tapping the phone calls so I'd have to assume the conversation in the documentary is accurate.  Those parerents are so fucked up I absolutely believe they would behave exactly as the recording played out.  Poor girl was completely brainwashed at that point as well...
Lego Friends: Girls on a Mission,Yes
Lego Friends: Girls on a Mission,"she and her mother are producers and were on set and involved in making this show

the whole article is about this. I know, I know"
Lego Friends: Girls on a Mission,Have you heard of the Boy Scouts of America by chance? I knew three boys molested by their scout leader (scout leaders were chosen by Mormon bishops as a calling) and molested in Mormon churches. The BSA scandal was also a Mormon scandal.
Lego Friends: Girls on a Mission,"I’d find it unbelievable until I learned they were Mormons, they will believe anything as long as your saying it’s in the name of god."
Lego Friends: Girls on a Mission,That documentary effed me up man. The sheer stupidity! It was too much
Lego Friends: Girls on a Mission,It was “Abducted in Plain Sight” on Netflix
Lego Friends: Girls on a Mission,There's no way he only gave up a hand job. That's the pg-13 version
Lego Friends: Girls on a Mission,I saw the documentary and her parents were so naive. I wanted to cry when they talked about their realization that they had failed their daughter and what they each had experienced. It was heartbreaking.
Lego Friends: Girls on a Mission,Yes it’s still on Netflix and it’s the craziest most aggravating thing I’ve ever watched.
Lego Friends: Girls on a Mission,"I’m imagining she recognizes that her parent’s naïveté was taken advantage of by a master manipulator. She was failed by more than her parents, also her school, community leaders, the Mormon church especially was awfully complicit."
Lego Friends: Girls on a Mission,"Yes, they definitely cover this!"
Lego Friends: Girls on a Mission,"Yes, they go into that and the mothers affair.  Also a lot more on what Jan was doing when she was kidnapped the second time and the whole alien story.

There's also a documentary on Peacock which assumes you know the story."
Lego Friends: Girls on a Mission,Because he’s always taking huge dumps
Lego Friends: Girls on a Mission,It's a reference to some obscure TV show. I think it was called The Workplace or something like that?
Lego Friends: Girls on a Mission,r/dundermifflin
Lego Friends: Girls on a Mission,I'll never forgive Andy for giving us Andy
Lego Friends: Girls on a Mission,Andy deserved it
Lego Friends: Girls on a Mission,"No, Clark was New Dwight"
Lego Friends: Girls on a Mission,"Absolutely, his character was like anxiety inducing on that show"
Lego Friends: Girls on a Mission,My favorite Jake Lacy role is in How to be Single. “As a kid I dressed up as a stay-at-home-dad for Halloween! This is my dream!” Or something along the lines of that…
Lego Friends: Girls on a Mission,He was so punchable in White Lotus.
Lego Friends: Girls on a Mission,You should check out the movie Significant Other with him and Maika Monroe. He killed it in that
Lego Friends: Girls on a Mission,"I haven’t finished season one, but from the few episodes I’ve seen he absolutely captures that terrifying rich white guy entitlement psychosis. He’s so menacing."
Lego Friends: Girls on a Mission,"I actually thought that in the Office, fuck young Jim.

But I love Dwight Jr."
Nightflyers,"""Let's get rid of The Expanse and make a piece of shit show without a plot"" - SyFy"
Nightflyers,"I'm not surprised. I won't say I had high hopes for Nightflyers, but I did have hope, and was disappointed to find out that [it's pretty much a total wreck aside from some solid effects work and a few good actors](https://www.reddit.com/r/television/comments/amsd8c/is_netflixs_nightflyers_as_bad_as_all_the_critics/efo91uo/). "
Nightflyers,"Wait, this had started already?"
Nightflyers,"Watched it to the end because I didn't want to just leave it, but my god it gets ridiculous. By the end I had more questions than at the beginning."
Nightflyers,"Shocker! 

I'd high hope for this show given its premise but it was so terrible & repetitive that I stopped watching after the 4th episode. "
Nightflyers,It was such a mess that I didn't realize they had a plan for a second season at all. I literally thought it was a one off and an ending with barely a resolution was on purpose.
Nightflyers,"Write your fuckin' book, George!"
Nightflyers,"Syfy are now well known for cancelling their sci-fi shows prematurely. The only shows they allowed to finish on their own terms since their recent push to have more sci-fi is 12 monkeys and Continuum. And the only one it looks like they might let finish now is, for some reason, Killjoys.

&#x200B;

The rest they have dropped:

The Expanse

Dark Matter

Channel Zero

Helix

Defiance

Aftermath

Incorporated

Blood Drive

Hunters

&#x200B;

I wonder if they are kicking themselves for not airing more wrestling and ghost-hunting reality shows.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;"
Nightflyers,"Dropped it after two episodes.

I just couldn't get into it at all."
Nightflyers,Feels like I’m the only one who liked this steaming pile of garbonara  :-(
Nightflyers,was i the only one that liked nightflyers? 
Nightflyers,I wish they didn't cancel Channel Zero. It was so good and from what I heard it didn't cost too much to make. It actually felt like an anthology instead of cycling through different roles for the same few actors. 
Nightflyers,I miss firefly .
Nightflyers,"I watched the first few episodes and actually enjoyed it, but then got distracted and never got around to finishing it.

I saw a random episode later on where that lady was pregnant with some sort of demon alien baby that needed to go into quarantine.

Was it really that bad?"
Nightflyers,Good. Make him finish The Winds of Winter first.
Nightflyers,Why do I feel like am the only person that remembers Dominion 
Nightflyers,Not sure how they could even strangle a second season out of that mess. 
Nightflyers,I knew it.
Nightflyers,"I'm about 5 episodes in and if I weren't just watching it for when I work out, I wouldn't continue."
Nightflyers,I loved this show! Such a shame they left it on a big cliffhanger 
Nightflyers,"Funny, just started watching the show on Netflix last night "
Nightflyers,"I could watch an entire show centred around Thale. He was a great character with a great actor behind him.

The rest of it was just kinda ""there"". Great actors, great acting, pointless show with no coherent story and no idea where it was going or what it wanted to be."
Nightflyers,I'm watching this right now. It's all over the place. 
Nightflyers,Had high hopes as well.. horrible acting.. bad all around 
Nightflyers,Never heard of the show.
Nightflyers,Even they want to motivate him to finish Winds of Winter
Nightflyers,"Sad news for Limerick, hopefully Troy Studios have other things lined up."
Nightflyers,It really wasn't as bad as everyone makes it out to be.  Compared to a lot of other stuff out there that is just all formula and generic plot (looking at you CW) yet get fawned over.  I think it's biggest problem is how it was marketed.  It was nothing what the trailers and interviews made it out to be and very fucking different from what Martin actually wrote. 
Nightflyers,"I only want fine, quality content, like [Ice Spiders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice_Spiders)"
Nightflyers,Didn't even realize it already aired. Not enough marketing and promotion probably also affected the rating.
Nightflyers,"I'm having feelings.

I'm feeling your feelings 

Rinse and repeat"
Nightflyers,Good. It was a waste of time 
Nightflyers,Honestly not too saddened by this news.  Getting through the first season felt like a chore.
Nightflyers,[deleted]
Nightflyers,What. the. acutal. fuck? I loved this show. fuck Syfy
Nightflyers,At least it wasn't as craptacular as the 1987 movie. 
Nightflyers,"Oh.

I was just about to start watching this too.

Oh well."
Nightflyers,Damn that was quick. Wasnt expecting the show to get cancelled so fast like that. Figured it would have pulled atleast 2-3 seasons. Though admittedly I only saw the first 3 episodes lol. 
Nightflyers,"I only watched the two free streaming episodes, but I was interested to see where it was heading. Glad I didn't get too invested in it though."
Nightflyers,Was it not like 5 days ago there was a post praising the show on Netflix... 
Nightflyers,Netflix is really cleaning house lately 
Nightflyers,Dumb show. 
Nightflyers,Everyone expecting Interstellar level quality when it comes to anything SciFi. 
Nightflyers,I was totally pulled in to this show. My wife and I binged it until it fell apart after the 2nd last episode. 
Nightflyers,"I didn't make it through the first episode, so yeah, good riddance."
Nightflyers,The show has zero storyline to it.  I couldn’t get through the second episode. 
Nightflyers,Started well but became a bit of a mess for the back half.
Nightflyers,"Good, now he can focus his attention on the book his never gonna finish."
Nightflyers,"We now bring you a GRRM show without GRRM. 

And...it’s canceled."
Nightflyers,"Watched the first 5 minutes of ep 1 n turned it off... Was going to come back to it at some point , but it sounds like my original instinct was correct"
Nightflyers,"They had an episode with cult women that fed themselves by using a jerk off machine on the male crew.

Yup that actually happened."
Nightflyers,No :( I was so hyped 
Nightflyers,The atmosphere kinda reminded me of Prey (2017). The whole rogue AI kinda reminded me of Shodan. They had some good ideas that I wish it could go deeper 
Nightflyers,a show so bad i couldn't even finish the trailer
Nightflyers,"Great, now let's wait for Netflix to pick this up for one season and then cancel it again for no reason, like they did with Travelers. "
Nightflyers,"It....was....terrible....not totally sure it was the RR’s real gig though, wasn’t it more of a stamp of approval?"
Nightflyers,"Am i the only one who liked it? I loved lommie, she's a great character and loved how they focused on her alot. D'Branins daughter arc was heart wrenching, the conflict between him and rowan when tessia gets locked in the medical bay, what mommie eris does to the baby.

I'll admit it definitely has it's problems,  but i could see the potential in a second series. 

*edit I'm being downvoted for an opinion. Stay classy reddit."
Nightflyers,Back to finishing the books then?
Nightflyers,Barely finished the first episode it was just bad
Nightflyers,it was pure shit
Nightflyers,"The movie from the 80's wasn't that good either, so not to surprised. "
Nightflyers,"Well um no surprise there... Honestly soon as he was a real dude and his mother was in the ships computers, the Albino computer hacker... Yeah got half way through episode 4 and never went back."
Nightflyers,That was expected. I couldn't even finish the first episode. It was really bad
Nightflyers,I couldn’t get through the first episode 
Nightflyers,Watched this on Netflix the other week and stopped half way through. Usually a solid genre for what I like but I honestly thought it was an awful show.
Nightflyers,"That's a shame, this had a lot of potential for growth.

Maybe Netflix will keep it going on its own?..."
Nightflyers,Yet Syfy gives the Magicians a fourth season... I dont understand their logic.
Nightflyers,This is what happens when you stray from the time honored tradition of boobs and dragons.
Nightflyers,Just bring back firefly. 
Nightflyers,"Good. Fuck you, finish your next GoT book, asshole. 😤"
Nightflyers,"Good, maybe now he'll have some time to fini---

haha jk."
Nightflyers,If it didn't suck so bad I might be upset but I'm not.
Nightflyers,Awww no Bud Lite commercial then? George come on sell out harder!
Nightflyers,God that showed sucked
Nightflyers,"""SyFy cancels another science fiction show""

*pikachureactionface"
Nightflyers,"who else is surprised Syfy is cancelling another show.

&#x200B;

lol"
Nightflyers,"I was turned off by this show by the amazing amount of commercials for it while watching The Expanse.  Until my wife can get the latest GoT book, im not watching anything by George RR Martin. "
Nightflyers,"If there is one thing Syfy knows, its cancelling stuff. They've got it down to a fine art."
Nightflyers,"Good, remind him that there’s only one franchise of his that’s successful. I’m not even a big book reader in general but the stuff he’s pulling with the GOT books is really lame. "
Nightflyers,"Martin's fantasy is good, his scifi not so much."
Nightflyers,Now that's humiliating
Nightflyers,[deleted]
Nightflyers,Who could relate to a cast of foreigners in the U.S.?
Nightflyers,And he still has no plans to finish ASOIAF before he dies.
Nightflyers,[deleted]
Nightflyers,"even that 6 episode miniseries about some guys going to space but was actually fake, was a better sci fi i guess."
Nightflyers,"Thank god amazon. I was an idiot and dismissed The Expanse because it was on the shit Canadian channel, “Space”. 

I’m now binging it on Amazon Prime "
Nightflyers,Has the expanse been cancelled???
Nightflyers,"To be truthful they never really owned it, while they did own this. That was a big reason why they tossed it, they spent a lot of money on something they were licensing when they wanted to spend money on something without ALSO having to license it. "
Nightflyers,"The expanse has the coolest of settings, but pretty much nothing else going for it as it seems that rather then being one show it's 20 different fantasy and sci-fi shows all **randomly smashed together** using the same base setting.

&#x200B;

Also what the goddamned f\*\*k is the point of making a *hyper realistic* space setting, only to then go and throw in things like magic alien goup?!?"
Nightflyers,First class gravy-training. It's a win in the end
Nightflyers,The book is only like 4 hours long on audible. Doesn't seem like enough content for a show anyway.
Nightflyers,"The cast is pretty mediocre and unappealing, imo"
Nightflyers,"Meh, I'm really enjoying the whole craziness of it. It's even more fun when high. "
Nightflyers,yeah I wanted to like it so much but just couldn't even finish it..
Nightflyers,"I don't like the show either, but damn is your review pompous as hell.

It almost makes me want to defend the show. Almost."
Nightflyers,"Started and ended.

They aired one episode per day (except for weekends) and finished the whole season in two weeks."
Nightflyers,[deleted]
Nightflyers,"Oh man, this optimist actually enjoyed the first half.  

It reeeeeallllly goes downhill.    
There is a space ship of cannibals who wank prisoners to make clones to eat.   

I want you to share my pain.  Don't think you can get away easily!"
Nightflyers,"I didn't make it through the first ep, and quickly forgot the show even existed. "
Russian Doll,"S1 was a great complete show but I've heard it was written to be three seasons so unless S3 pulls it all together, S2 felt unnecessary."
Russian Doll,"The only part I really liked was when Alan ends up in the bathroom from season 1 and they're playing that song again ""Gotta get up, gotta get out, gotta get home before the morning comes . . . "" and he answers the knock on the door and it's Nadia (thank god) and she's like ""Jesus Christ, this fucking song!""  

The rest was  . . . interesting, but certainly not a surprising or interesting as S1."
Russian Doll,"If you're looking for a  half hour comedy drama about a woman dealing with her Jewish transgenerational trauma though the power of time travel that holds up in its recently second season, I would recommend **Undone**."
Russian Doll,"i re-watched season 1 right before watching season 2 and i'll agree that season 1 is far superior, but season 2 is still decent"
Russian Doll,"I couldn't get past the second ep, and I loved the first season."
Russian Doll,"Alan should have just been left out of the main story just have him come up in passing. His whole thing with Germany had nothing to do with the main plot and Lenny wasn't around long enough for us to really care when he left to go to East Germany.

I liked Nadia's story but I didn't really care for the ending where all of a sudden it is a month later and we are at Ruth's post-funeral gathering. I would have liked it more if the whole story had started with Ruth dying but Nadia refusing to accept her adoptive mother's death bleeds into her ""time traveling"" and trying to change things, but in the end Ruth is always going to die and there is nothing she can do to stop it. This way it connects better to the first season where she had blamed herself for her mother's death and finally had to accept that it wasn't her fault."
Russian Doll,"I'm so over the whole ""quirky characters"" thing that TV shows do now. Inventing Anna suffered from the same thing.

They're like caricatures of real people."
Russian Doll,"I feel like it should have ended at S1 and been a limited series. 

S2 Natasha Lyonne is wonderful, and there's some gems of dialogue here and there but the story just goes everywhere and is very confusing.  It lacks the sense of wonder the first season had."
Russian Doll,"I think it is creative- it just tries to do way too much at once. I'm Jewish and the granddaughter of a Holocaust survivor so at the same time there were things in there about trauma that I found deeply relatable but also I saw how scattered everything was and how many different things were flung in haphazard so that the total was less than the sum of its parts. And my conspiracy theory is that in the original conception of the season (when it was pitched as a 3 season show) it was meant to be more of an anthology with new characters and Alan wasn't supposed to be in it, and when he proved popular they had to shoehorn him into this season but did a bad job with it. His plotline could have been really interesting if they'd devoted any actual time/plot significance to it, but instead his main role seems to just be the same as S1- to remind Nadia in Episode 7 that she's being selfish."
Russian Doll,"Agreed. Season 2 was a confusing mess. Half of what Nadia said was gibberish. And Alan? What the ?!? I like the character but both his and Nadia’s trips were pointless. 

It was like expecting a Dr. Pepper and getting a Professor Pop. :("
Russian Doll,"I guess I'll go against the general grain of the comments here and say I loved Season 2, not as much as season 1 of course but still enjoyed it a lot. I wish Alan had a more fleshed out storyline as he is my favourite character as I relate to so many of his anxieties and mental issues."
Russian Doll,"Wasn't quite as good as season 1, but I still really enjoyed it.  A lot of the end of it worked better as metaphor than plot.  I've got a pretty good tolerance for that type of storytelling, but I can definitely see why others wouldn't like it as much."
Russian Doll,"Agreed. I binged them back to back and I was way more invested in Season 1. I absolutely loved that first season, but I probably wouldn't rewatch Season 2."
Russian Doll,Agree with everything that OP said and… the season is less than the sum of its parts. Loved s1 but this was borderline…bad storytelling. Struggled with stakes and urgency.
Russian Doll,"Totally agree. I loved Season 1 so much and couldn’t wait for season 2. Season 2, however was such a let down. It dragged even though there was way too much going on at once and there was no inkling of a satisfying ending. Not quite sure what they were even trying to say this season. Season 1 seems to have a clear arc, message, and story whereas Season 2 was scattered, middling, and had a lot of unnecessary plots."
Russian Doll,"Season 2 makes no sense 

-	finds out mom has spent gold coins
-	goes back in time to get coins 
-	loses coins
-	goes back farther in time to get other stuff for gold coins to help family?
-	I stopped here as the story seem be solving a problem she created in the first place."
Russian Doll,"When they went to Europe I stopped watching. A meandering mess and not even close to being as good as season 1.  


Disappointed"
Russian Doll,Season 1 is AMAZING. Season 2 sucks. 75% of the way through it and don't even care to finish it.
Russian Doll,Gonna tell my kids there was only one season of Russian Doll.
Russian Doll,"Tedious and unnecessary was how I described it too in another post, nothing gripping or anything to hook you in, it’s living off the goodwill built with us in the first season"
Russian Doll,Yeah it pretty meh
Russian Doll,"Think its its a bit like Johnny Depp in Pirates Caribbean movies, first movie was a masterwork in story telling its a perfect jigsaw puzzle.

All the other movies are johnny depp being captain jack and thats enough. To me Russian Doll is similar it had that weird charismatic main character and the fact the whole story made no sense S2 does not matter you still show up for the main character alone."
Russian Doll,I really liked season 2 but I do prefer season 1. The premise was a lot weirder than the more traditional time loop of the first season but I think that made for some really interesting character interactions and editing.
Russian Doll,"Agreed. I wish it ended at season 1, it was perfect. I thought it was essentially purgatory or like a Buddhist hell so the ending to me was them finally passing on. It could have ended there perfectly, with the ending being left to interpretation (but in the rare instance where that's a good way to end it). It just felt like a completed story. To keep them alive and continuing a finished story feels like a bad sequel to me. Plus it's clearly only about Nadia's story, Alan is added as a second thought. In the first season, Alan and Nadia fit in together better as both of their storylines fit each other's (although I wish we saw more of Alan's life, like what his family was like, how his OCD developed, etc), but in the second season it feels like they have nothing to do with each other other than having the weird ability to die multiple times and now time travel."
Russian Doll,I find it so boring and messy. They tried to make a little too much on S2 and the plot now is just like one of those pizzas with chicken wings and mancheroni on top that you find in very nasty places....
Russian Doll,I didn't understand a single thing in season 2 at all. Season 1 was great
Russian Doll,"The only thing I don't get is that like....did they combine timelines or something?

It would have been cool if Alan and Nadia met up together properly through the time fuckery but instead it feels they just kinda...always did?

Is this a retcon? Did I miss something?"
Russian Doll,"I only watched  episode 1 and just lost any interest for the simple fact I don't care about ""the premise"" at all. Like, I watched season 1 because (even if it came up to be bad, which it wasn't of course) I really like the premise of ""You keep dying and reliving the same day"", for two reasons:1- I kind of imagine what I'd do if it happened to me: like, at first I wouldn't even hate it, imagine being able to do anything you want without consequences because you're gonna ""reset"" anyway: you could commit crimes, spend all your money on experiences (I say ""on experiences"" because if you spend it on stuff, you'll just ""rent it"" until you die: while if you go to, idk, Disneyland, you'll keep your memories just like you would do in ""regular"" life with the bonus of getting back your money once you die ahah). You could know what numbers will win the lottery and be crazy rich until you die. You could basically do anything in those 24/72 hours before you die (since even while in the loop sometimes they got to see the next morning, sometimes they didn't). Now, I know there are two issues with this, the first being that in Russian Doll it doesn't work like that and every death actually ""modifies"" the next loop, so what I said would only work if the ""rules"" of that universe were that every loop was the same and not influenced by the ones before, and the second is that of course it would eventually become horrible in the long run if you're a person that wants to do long term stuff like having a career, start a family and have kids etc. But if you're one of those ""all I care about is have fun"" lone-wolf people (I'm not), I can see it wouldn't even be that bad, you could be young forever.The concept itself is so fascinating, I wouldn't even mind a mediocre series about it.

2- Again, this didn't happen in Russian Doll, Nadia hated the loop right from the begin and was already trying to get out of it after her first death, but in general, after the character has had the ""omg I'm enjoying this, I can do whatever they want"" phase (I know I'd do lol but as I said, only for a while, I would want a normal life eventually), the getting out of the loop part is fascinating too. How does that work? Why did it start? What are the ""laws"" and ""rules"" of the loops? How do you get out of it? Does a loop influence the next ones? Is there any kind of long term consequence to your actions in one loop? Is it a possibility that the loop may just ""end"" not by you getting out of it but by dying permanently, as in you die ""one last time"" and you stay dead? Or, at the opposite, you could live and die and reset for the whole eternity?That's fascinating too.

So yeah, I love the time loop mechanic as a concept and that's what made me watch Russian Doll. Remove that, I really have no reason to watch it. I don't care about Nadia's mother, the gold that was stolen, I don't like the 80s as a time period, there's not one single thing that makes me want to go on.Hell, I actually consider good ol' ""regular"" time travel (the one where you go in the past to change things and ""fix"" the present/future) to be nonsensical, not interesting if not just stupid. I think it's the most boring way to use narratively the concept of time.So not just they're done with the ""concept"" that I liked about it, they even added a ""concept"" that I find boring. Well, no, hard pass. And that doesn't mean it's bad of course, it's just my opinion, there may be folks who love good ol' ""go in the past to fix the future"" time travel, that's just not me."
Russian Doll,"I liked season 2 overall, but it didn’t  come together for me until the last 2 episodes where everything went totally off the rails. In a good way. It paid off what it was actually building up to. Though a the cost of making certain early   aspects irrelevant. Despite that I thought the emotional core of the season came through and it shined. 

With season 3 wrapping the story, I do hope the bring the focus back to Nadia AND Alan as the latter didn’t get enough to do."
Russian Doll,Season One wasn't really to my liking.  Felt a little too busy story wise.  But I haven't watched season two.  Perhaps the creators fixed the issue
Russian Doll,"I haven't seen any of them, but how do you make a second season of a time loop show?"
Russian Doll,Alan could have had more story for sure. But i thought  s2 was great.
Russian Doll,Yeah it was utter crap.
Russian Doll,I couldn't get past the first ep. I adore Natasha Lyonne and thought I'd watch anything she did but not every series needs a follow up.
Russian Doll,Literally just about to watch season 2. Guess I will skip it. Finishing Grace & Frankie instead. Thanks for the warning.
Russian Doll,it’s just like watching her run around in portals not knowing what is going on and I don’t think they do either.
Russian Doll,"This is gratifying to read. I thought I was just too high to pay attention. 

Phew."
Russian Doll,It didn't make much sense. They felt force to make a new one with new crazyness but they failed. I only liked the references to the first season. The time travels were absurd and inconsistent. The ending was nice.
Russian Doll,"It's a huge mess and a perfect example of a situation where the story just doesn't hold a candle to the great characters and acting. The idea for Season 2 is fantastic, but the execution is half-baked. You trim the fat and rewrite a few things, and suddenly you have a brilliant product."
Russian Doll,"I disagree, it was horrible. I love Natasha Lyonne but good lord this was horrible. It made no sense most of the time, Nadia just walks around snarking for no reason and there seemed to be no rhyme or reason for the time jumps. 

I could go on for days."
Russian Doll,"Really disagree. Loved every minute of it. It was different from season 1 but had the same vein of time, the characters changed and grew, we laughed, we cried. Sorry you didnt enjoy it, but if you want more of season 1 watch every other groundhog day copy on the market. Downa-voteda!"
Russian Doll,My biggest problem with it was seeing Nadia smoke like a chimney and even drink alcohol while she was pregnant with herself. Nobody smokes cigarettes anymore but for some reason these characters do even knowing they’re killing themselves. How can you have a hipster crowd and no ecigs?
Russian Doll,I had zero interest in Alan’s story. The character isn’t likable and it seems maybe the actor is overdoing it?
Russian Doll,"> and the ending kind of resolves the entire story without having the main characters put effort into doing so.

Considering that ultimately for both of them it was about ""acceptance"" and letting go of compulsion, I don't think the show made an error there.

>but it feels lackluster and unnecessary when compared to the first season.

I think it depends on what you call ""necessity"".
I agree that Alan's subplot was underexplored, which made his resolution kind of less impactful, and inversely it gave Nadia's plot a bit too much time to meander making me feel like I didn't get where this was supposed to be going in the middle.
But I think the end was pretty poignant, generally paying off on most of it.

So I don't agree that it is a lack of creativity. Maybe it's more that you don't empathise with the proposed emotional level as much as you did with the first?"
Russian Doll,"I personally feel like this season is setting up for the final season. Like Fight club was. If you understood and knew it, you just knew what was going on. I am having a hard time with season 2 as well. Whomever wrote the script was way to heavy on the puns and didn't take into consideration that not everyone has dictionary sitting next to them. Every other sentence that comes out of her mouth is some reference to something else, like puns. (Or maybe I'm just that dumb I dunno)

>!I'm pretty sure we're being set up so that Nadia has some sort of mental illness. Her extreme intelligence could be part of it. The way she talks, etc. She didn't act like this in the first season. We're probably going to find out she's a schizophrenic and she created this entire story in her head in a padded room some place.!<"
Russian Doll,"lol am I the only one who hated Season 1 too? Really hate  this ""Groundhog Day but with X twist"" shows and I don't think Russian Doll did anything super cool with the premise. I didn't tune in for Season 2 but I'm not surprised by the hate."
Russian Doll,That show is disappointing in general. Stopped a few episodes in
Russian Doll,"Let's see if Kathleen Kennedy fires another person due to ""creative differences"" (because their work outside Star Wars doesn't do well anymore)."
Russian Doll,also what was with the dmt trip? according to mckenna on dmt everything is throbbing and machine like and people often see these machine elves and it only lasts 15 minutes
Russian Doll,I didn't make it through Season 1. Wasn't my cup of acid-laced tea...
Russian Doll,That's Netflix for ya
Russian Doll,Season 2 feels disjointed. I'm having a hard time considering the two seasons as one show.
Russian Doll,"If you take away the soundtrack of goth deep cuts and the tired “time travel to the 80s” trope, you’re left with something pretty close to one of those cheesy 80s “mind swap” comedies that always seemed to have Kirk Cameron in them.

Also Natasha Lyonne needs to stop with the poor woman’s Fran Lebowitz routine and broaden her range."
Russian Doll,i'm so lost trying to figure out s2.
Russian Doll,"I was dreading watching Season 2, because I didn't see what there was for them to do and that it would be horrible. Unfortunately, I was right. Season 1 was complete and unique and funny. Season 2 is unfunny and grating. They've taken Nadia's odd traits and exaggerated them to the point of making her completely annoying and unlikeable and nonsensical. I can only suppose this was done under the theory of the more, the better. That theory was quickly disproven in the very first episode of Season 2. The plot is illogical and boring, not enough to sustain the first episode, let alone the whole season. That guy she hooked up with while she was her mother was creepy. She shouldn't have been drinking while pregnant. She was from the future and would have known that. And for God's sakes, take the cigarettes away from her.  This must explain why she's so dense. Booze and cigs ruined her in utero. If you haven't watched it yet, don't bother. It's not worth the time."
Russian Doll,"What I don’t understand is S1 was about Nadia becoming liberated from her trauma (mainly due to her mother and childhood) Hence her childhood self saying “today we become free”. (So powerful btw) but S2 it just seems like all that hard work she did to stop dying and dying over again, along with expanding her sense of empathy and care for other people, completely dissolved itself. She’s even more selfish than before, seems like she’s still lost in an abyss of her mother, and still doesn’t make time to show up for the people that care about her. I think the core of the storyline and the expansion on her families connection to W2 and all that comes with it is great-the execution and the character of Nadia just feels like what was the point of season 1 really is she’s just going to revert back to how she was before the time loop even began!!! There are some charming things to the plot line, but the selfish idiot sandwich Nadia eats constantly grates my nerves. Almost makes it unbearable to watch in my opinion. Maybe this character is doomed to stubbornness no matter the dramatic lessons thrown her way. 
Spoilers: 
What really frustrated me was when she was sent to the hospital and tried to convince the doctor her mother was actually there. Like Nadia!! You’re in her body? How does it make sense that your in your moms timeline, living in her body (something that she has been fully aware of since almost the beginning) but yet finds herself in a position where she convinced herself and others that they are 2 autonomous people. I do understand “this is what is was like to be your mom” and how she said “this is what it must be like to be in my moms mind” or something like that but 😩 idk I’m just frustrated S1 was better and connected me much deeper to the story."
Russian Doll,"I haven't heard this yet.   S2 is definitely a bit muddled and weirder than s1.  The problem for me is by even though as it moves along , it gets weirder and funnier/quirkier , it feels like it was all for nothing unless I missed something. Still liked it tho."
Russian Doll,"That's funny. A Netflix Show with a complete series.

Edit: A few snuck by Netflix's hammer"
Russian Doll,"I forgot this show even came back. I dropped it after about 5 episodes in season 1, just didn’t enjoy it. For season 2 to feel underwhelming, it must’ve really missed the mark for some people"
Russian Doll,I liked that part too and I think it was because it reminded me of how good S1 was.
Russian Doll,I like me a good dose of Bob Odenkirk so yeah.
Russian Doll,"OMG, I didn't realize the second season was out! That's fantastic news!"
Russian Doll,Thank you!! Had no idea the second season was out.
Russian Doll,I do think its an issue with a lot of shows that have outstanding first seasons.   Its always so hard to follow up those seasons of near-perfection.  Like westworld season 1 or Barry season 1
Russian Doll,"Same, it just wasn't interesting. The writing felt sloppy and muddled."
Russian Doll,"The only reason I kept on watching was the music, it's the only thing on par with the first season."
Russian Doll,there are definitly people in this world that behave like nadia what are you talking about lol
Russian Doll,It was always supposed to follow Nadia throughout but you might be right about Alan not originally planned to be a part of the second season. Natasha Leone said that Alan changed a lot from the initial pitch to the final product of season one so it might be that her and the other writers didn’t change much from the original season two idea and more included Alan in it because they ended up really liking the character/actor.
Russian Doll,"I always found Alan hard work, and I felt like I was on crazy pills considering how everyone else was talking about him. I just could not *believe* that in the middle of Lyonne putting in an absolutely ferocious one woman show we were having to change rails. It felt like having to eat my veggies mid-dessert.

I couldn't help feeling like people were reacting to the novelty of switching focus and the twists and turns around him rather than the character himself."
Russian Doll,Natasha (or the writers not sure which) leaned WAY too hard into Natasha's NYC schtick. Like the raspy heavy New York accent spitting out one liners constantly. Got old quick.
Russian Doll,"I'm disagreeing with the performance part op said, the nadia character seems like a person improv'ing that character suddenly, breaking in and out of character. I found it really jarring. I get that she was sardonic, sarchastic and a little on the bleak side in terms of their pov, but in s2 it's just like she's totally detatched."
Russian Doll,"Kinda surprised her story and Alan’s were not split into different seasons. To really focus on eras they were travelling to

I think if she time traveled and it wasn’t a choice like s1 deaths it would add more tension."
Russian Doll,What a great analogy.
Russian Doll,"yeah i wanted a bit more from his half of things.   I guess season 1 was more focused on him finding salvation and learning to move forward.   And season 2 was more about doing the same for Nadia instead.   
  
I did like the ending bit with >!his grandmother in the subway though.   And her lines about ""i dont know what happened, and thats okay."" as well as ""dont be so afraid of making mistakes that you never live"".!<   That was advice i really needed to hear"
Russian Doll,">  A lot of the end of it worked better as metaphor than plot

this is a great point.  I really enjoyed the conclusion of the final season - but it was absolutely more metaphor than plot or explanation.    It got really weird with it too, but i was hooked the whole time"
Russian Doll,"i didnt like season 2 as much, but i thought the final episode was outstanding.    It meandered it a bit to get there, but the character arc and storytelling for her was amazing in the end.    And the line about ""if onlys"" really resonated with me"
Russian Doll,"S1 had its flaws too. For the first 3 or 4 episodes, she thought that her whole experience was caused by smoking a drug. Come on. By Ep2 it should've been clear it's not the drug."
Russian Doll,"> and there was no inkling of a satisfying ending.

i agree with the rest of your points, but i thought there was a good ending to it and wrap up. >!she learned to accept and embrace her past by literally 'choosing' her mom as her mom in the subway. She finally accepts that you cant change the past, and even though she made mistakes - like missing Ruth's last moments - theres no reason to dwell on the ""if onlys"".   Its just coney island.  And she goes to be with her friends at the wake instead, and live with those mistakes. Certainly not a happy ending, but i did find it satisfying. it was a message about embracing yourself and your past and learning to focus on what you can change in the future instead.!<"
Russian Doll,"To spoil the ending.

...


...

 It's a time loop. The gold she got from from Hungary was what was originally used to buy the Kruger Rands. Which she then ended up losing. 

The problem that needed to be solved was her tendency to blame her mother for everything wrong in her life. Her trip back to the past taught her that there was nothing she could do to change the past so excessively worrying about it was wasting her life. And that she needed to appreciate what good she had in the present because it might not always be around."
Russian Doll,[deleted]
Russian Doll,[deleted]
Russian Doll,Or you could watch and form your own opinion!
Russian Doll,"FWIW, I love season two in a different way than season 1.  The writing was witty, it was somewhat unpredictable, and the acting was great.  It's not as good as season one because season one is close to being a masterpiece, imo."
Russian Doll,"I mean isn’t part of the point that she blames her mom for putting her at risk her whole life through the decisions she made, but then faced with a similar opportunity Nadia makes the same kind of choices? I sort of viewed it as a small part of her whole journey to better understand the lives her ancestors lived and the choices they made"
Russian Doll,There are still over a billion smokers and pretty sure Natasha Lyonne smokes like a chimney irl.
Russian Doll,"I enjoyed season 1 because I like time loops but I agree it didn't bring much to it. However season 2 is a completely different thing and I loved it. I'm surprised by the general dislike here, and I hope we get to see a third season, since it really seemed to be built that way."
Russian Doll,"I felt like this season's main point was to show that there are some things about you that you can't change, no matter how hard you try, especially the things that define you/made you into the person that you are. So Nadja can't bring herself as a baby to ""now"" and give herself a better childhood, because her crappy childhood is excactly what made her become herself. So season 1 would be about things that you can change (like be nicer and help other people), season 2 would be about accepting yourself and the things you can't change."
Russian Doll,"[Here’s the article](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/general-news/natasha-lyonne-why-russian-doll-will-be-3-seasons-one-writing-mistake-1229415/amp/). And relevant part:

> **You initially pitched Russian Doll to Netflix as a three-season series. Do you still envision it that way?**

> In many ways, yes. I see it quite concretely, and it will be interesting to see what evolves. The beauty of the power of the writers room is that Alan (Charlie Barnett) was a very different character in the original pitch and pilot. Month two of the room is where he really came alive. Before then, he had been a whole variety of other figures and now, looking back, imagining that show without Alan is almost impossible. Because of that experience, I know there has to be space left open for something beyond my limited imagination in this moment to know if that is still where the series begins, middles and ends. Maybe it’s only two seasons. Maybe it’s four seasons. Right now, it feels quite clearly that it is those three.

> **What kind of early ideas do you have for season two?**

> I think where Russian Doll has been successful is that there’s a very clear sense of character in Nadia so that you can have very high-concept things happen to her, but they always feel earned. They’re backed by some sort of lived experience so they don’t feel like they’re floating in space or completely in the realm of sci-fi. From that perspective, I have some big ideas, and I think this show will continue to work so long as that journey continues to be interesting and worth watching and new. I want to be learning in real time along with her and along with our audience."
Russian Doll,"What i dont understand how this show go fron time loop to time travel, and why what happen i  the ending of s1 didnt impact anything to s2"
Russian Doll,Dark?
Russian Doll,Ozark?
Russian Doll,Narcos? Castlevania?
Russian Doll,I loved season 1 of Russian Doll but I was severely disappointed by its second season. I loved the first season of Undone even more and I think that season 2 is fantastic. I hope you'll like it too.
Russian Doll,"Not sure I would agree with putting Barry there. Season 2 was the bees-knees and s3 is starting of great! Season 1 might be the best but the rest aren't far behind.

True Detective is probably something I would include though. Season 1 feels so unique and special in its tone and setting but Season 2 was mostly just a convoluted but generic cops and robbers story (to me)."
Russian Doll,"It’s funny bc I had to work my way through the Nadia bits because I found her totally over the top and unrelatable, and then when I got to Alan I was like… oh look an  actual person! I’m not sure I think either of them totally feel like actual people to me, and I don’t precisely relate to either of them, but I did identify much more with Alan."
Russian Doll,"I love Alan's character. I think he's very relatable to anyone who's had major anxiety/depression issues, who wants stability, and it gave such huge contract to Nadia's character who doesn't want to be tied down and extroverted. Then we see these two characters with very contrasting personalities work together to get out of this situation, and how time fixes itself is that they have to be there for the other person. They have to think not of their own issues but care for a person who is completely opposite.

I think a major reason I love season one so much is that clash of personalities and how they have to cooperate. How they change each other, and grow when they consider the other person. Their relationship felt to me about the power of empathy and just showing someone they care, and how it makes a difference"
Russian Doll,">Natasha (or the writers not sure which) leaned WAY too hard into Natasha's NYC schtick. Like the raspy heavy New York accent spitting out one liners constantly. Got old quick.

I don't watch the show but my wife does and it seemed like every time I walked in the room and it was on, the main character was tossing out one-liners non-stop in some heavy NYC accent.

It was so over the top and silly I actually asked her what she was watching. It almost sounded like a cartoon."
Russian Doll,"I know I'm months late but having finally watched this just gotta say this comment basically encapsulates all my feelings.

Overall season 2 didn't impress me very much. But the final episode, especially the ending, actually did wreck me."
Russian Doll,"yes that part dragged on way too long and i almost gave up watching. imo, season 1 only gets interesting starting from episode 4 when Alan is introduced."
Russian Doll,"I can definitely see that and am glad others, like yourself, found it satisfying after a very weird ride. I just felt so so much happened throughout the 7 episodes that it felt like a rushed and a bit of a contrived way to wrap it all up."
Always a Witch,"This show really missed the mark for me. Willow was a movie that Millennials grew up with but this was clearly geared to gen z who, I think, mostly don't care about the IP. Willow got sidelined as a character and the story felt like an incredibly generic YA fantasy plotline with Willow stamped on it. I had the same complaint about Wednesday but that at least kept the Tim Burton AF vibe through a lot of it, and who doesn't love Danny Elfman covering Metallica? Willow seemed to try too hard and then give up entirely. Watching Davis step back into the role was a treat but they... Fuck I'm not gonna say it.... Okay fuck it. They shortchanged him bad. And I say that with all respect to a living legend. His scenes, especially about his and Sorcha's history, were great. Everything else felt like Disney said ""How old could Millennials be? 10 years?"""
Always a Witch,"I tried to do some research into viewership, and it was obviously not particularly conclusive, but certainly pointing towards lower viewership then required for a sequel series if the show didn't pick up a lot more viewers in later works. The bad word of mouth/user ratings probably didn't help.

https://medium.com/@plumresearch/willow-on-disney-b702a8874c74#"
Always a Witch,"""Did he get EP?“

""He did.""

""Good for him!"""
Always a Witch,"I think they really missed the mark with casting, script, and music selection. So many ridiculous lines, delivery, and terrible covers broke the immersion constantly."
Always a Witch,"I liked the series enough. The one thing I didn't particularly care for, and I must be in the minority since I haven't seen it voiced elsewhere, was that it felt more of an ensemble, and that Willow was just a supporting character. I was really hoping for Warwick Davis to shine, and I think he can definitely carry a show."
Always a Witch,They never made a legitimate season 1.
Always a Witch,"If you didn't want to end up hemming and hawing about sequel possibilities, you should have made sure the people in charge had the property's legacy in mind when developing it, as opposed to their own personal checklist."
Always a Witch,"Man is a legend, and genuinely a nice guy. I noticed him while traveling through Italy and he actually greeted me!!!!"
Always a Witch,"I really enjoyed Willow. Here are the main things that bugged me: costumes were too modern, as was the language (including, but not limited to, swears). Most of all, though, was the modern music that ended most episodes and sometimes was played during the episodes proper. Why did the season end with “Money for Nothing”? Best I could figure was because, if there is a second season, the characters will find themselves in Dire Straits."
Always a Witch,If season 2 is more like episodes 6-8 than 1-5 I’m in.
Always a Witch,"Show sucks.  So.  Bad.

Could've been handled smartly, wasn't.  Shame."
Always a Witch,"Yeah I doubt it, even though they definitely aimed for at least another season or two.

* The show was weirdly paced, with some parts aiming to be slow paced while others are cut too quickly to compensate for list time. 

* The atmosphere jumps back and forth between being a YA CW show to a gritty fantasy. It's pretty odd jumping back and forth between characters making immature jokes and a plot significant character dying suddenly. I think we lost a third of the cast by EP 3 for... Dramatic impact? I barely even got attached to them.

* i'm not gonna pretend the original Willow was Shakespeare, but the dialogue was irritating in how modern it was. At least pretend you're in a fantasy setting.

* Every character quips like they're in a Joss Whedon production. At certain moments I'd beg the characters to STOP. TALKING.

* Story is for the most part predictable and dull.

* Character dynamics are forced. There's 0 chemistry between the cast, and Kit is the most insufferable, with Boorman taking second place for the most cliche quip-slinging scoundrel.

* Was it just me or Warwick Davis' didn't even try acting?"
Always a Witch,This show was… not good.
Always a Witch,I don't think it makes it to season 2.
Always a Witch,"If it actually gets renewed, please hire new writers."
Always a Witch,They had a sequel book series called shadow moon that honestly would have been a better path for them to take.
Always a Witch,"Being Gen X - I watched the Willow movie probably more than Star Wars New Hope. 

This show was not Willow - it was not the world of Willow. What was the scene with the 1800s frontier people all about? And don’t get me started on the trolls.

The show reeks of nepotism - Jonathan Kasdan does not have the talent of his father, nor the voice of his generation. Yet, time and again, he is given these huge projects because of his relation to his father.

I have little hope for Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny.

Maybe I would’ve enjoyed it more if it didn’t have the “Willow” label.

I laughed a bit and thought there were good moments. But it didn’t feed off the world the original movie built.

I’m all for growing audience awareness and presenting new opportunities for people to become a part of a treasured franchise - some traditions need breaking down, but this series tore down the original foundation the movie built that endeared us to it years ago.

I just can’t believe people signed off after reading the scripts - especially the first one - just bad."
Always a Witch,"It was … ok. Pretty trope-y YA stuff. Felt like they robbed pretty heavily from everything.  Multiple times it felt like Harry Potter meets LotR meets Fantasy Star Wars, but it was decent for what it was.  Would I ever re-watch or recommend though?  Nope."
Always a Witch,But it’s so awful
Always a Witch,"So did they finish the story arc, or is this something else I shouldn't start watching only to be disappointed in a cliffhanger"
Always a Witch,(Insert Arrested Development reference here)
Always a Witch,Won’t cry when they cancel it. It’s like the Disney Channel tried to re-imagine Game of Thrones.
Always a Witch,"I wanted so bad to love this series.  I will do anything to support Warwick Davis, as he's legitimately one of my favorite people on this damn planet.  I LOVE the Willow movie.  I love love love the movie.  I do not subscribe to any streaming services, so when the show was announced, I figured I would be buying Disney+ for a month to watch it, but I was able to watch the first episode at my mom's house.

The first ep is all Ive watched still.  I just couldn't really get  into it.  It didnt grab me like the movie.  It felt *too new* and too unfamiliar.  I still loved seeing Warwick, I still love him as an actor and I know it mustve been so special for him to play Willow again, but Im struggling to get into it and it makes me feel bad."
Always a Witch,I read that in the Arrested Development narrator's voice.
Always a Witch,I didn’t even make it past the first episode.
Always a Witch,"My kids and I loved it, started out a bit rough, but definitely got better. I hope it gets one more roll."
Always a Witch,I wouldn't bet on it.
Always a Witch,The story was ok but the dialogue was just awful. It was like watching a bad CW show
Always a Witch,"I say this as someone who grew up with the movie and still quotes it to this day with friends: this is a truly terrible series. Atrocious writing, editing, casting and acting. From the top down, this production is full of baffling decisions. I would not let Kasdan near another franchise."
Always a Witch,Let’s do a Legend series instead
Always a Witch,"Was a fun and funny show, felt like a good d&d campaign or something. I hope they get renewed."
Always a Witch,"Watched 2 episodes and gave up. The show sucked on so many levels, annoying characters with zero charisma. And how the hell is Davis not the main character. Movie is not that good to begin with, and the show just shat all over the nostalgia it had build up through the years"
Always a Witch,"I looked forward to this show so much. And I haven’t felt so betrayed since..the last time they revived a franchise Millenials and Xers and Boomers loved and just made it for what old people think Gen Z will like. Horrific writing, editing, production, everything. Why would you do this. We waited forty years and this is what you do? Why, why, why?"
Always a Witch,"I liked it, it was fun and didn't take itself seriously with some refreshing trope subversions. Would definitely watch a second and third season, as a show it's a nice palate cleanser fom all the other grimdark series."
Always a Witch,"I just finished it.

I thought it was a limited series.

I thought it was far better than Reddit indicated to me lol.

I was not a fan of the film and so enjoyed this more."
Always a Witch,"I was sooo disappointed by this series..

The terrible dialogue


The ""princess is a lesbian"" trope


The one good written character arc dying (to free princess from marriage obligations)


Willow just being mopey half the time

Me and wife loved the film and were giddy to see this show.. wife thinks they tried to force too much modern society into a fantasy story, and I just watched it to see if maybe it got better.. it didnt"
Always a Witch,"The show wasn't great, but it was decent in spots. I actually enjoyed the anachronistic needle drops everyone else seemed bothered by."
Always a Witch,I'm sure the hundreds of people watching will be eagerly awaiting a second season.
Always a Witch,Season 2? Most people have never seen episode two
Always a Witch,Please focus on editing and writing. I really liked some of the themes and visuals especially towards the end but new shows now have this amateurish feel to them.
Always a Witch,I dropped this series after episode five because it jumped the shark.  Episode five was beyond awful.
Always a Witch,This needs to be cancelled.
Always a Witch,I loved it. To be honest I only watched it after having a few on my day off and strictly as a comedy. But I liked it a lot.
Always a Witch,"""more story to tell"", there was barely any story in this season.
This show was just not good at all. Doesn't  feel anything like the original film."
Always a Witch,"Willow was extremely derivative and by-the-numbers 90s nostalgia pandering, and I loved every minute of it."
Always a Witch,"I was a bit irritated by the way they introduced the “Women aren’t accepted as fighters/knights,” thing. In OG Willow, Sorsha was a badass; they could easily have made the setting accepting of women warriors. This made a lot of the conflict in the first episode feel really contrived to me."
Always a Witch,"I named my kid after something in this amazing movie from my youth and now I am embarrassed because of the show.  I’m sorry kid, I guess I should have named you “Maze Runner Divergent.”"
Always a Witch,"I had such high hopes for this man, so much hope and then Disney pissed all over it.

Terrible costumes, terrible script, mind numbing dialogue, incoherent and utterly baffling story.

Fucking hell"
Always a Witch,"I liked it a lot, hope it gets a second season"
Always a Witch,"I was 5 when the movie came out and my dad watched it on VHS all the time, he loved that movie. I thought it was good, but was never a super fan. I went in having zero expectations and I enjoyed it - mostly for its comedy and it felt like a D&D campaign. I didn’t rewatch the movie beforehand so it’s probably been 15 years since I’ve seen the movie, but I did appreciate the cameos from the movie. There was definitely some random “wtf” moments - but overall I enjoyed it considering how low my expectations were. I feel like they were trying to capture the same kind of audience Netflix gets from Stranger Things."
Always a Witch,After watching episodes 1-2 I felt the need to watch it all the way through just to see if it could get worse and it did. Was really excited when I heard about the project but that show was bad.
Always a Witch,"I was looking forward to this the teaser interview with warrick and cast was funny but the show was a train wreck, tone was all over the place. The orginal was average back in the day but had its moments but this was cringy as hell. Still better that the rings of power snooze fest"
Always a Witch,"this show is very much like the witcher, were the main character has become a support character.  that said, i only watched 2 episodes then i bailed out, because the whole show looked like a bad cosplay. 

and the fun part is we all made fun of sony how they screwed up constantly, yet with the last of us they did everything right. stay close to the source material and let joel and ellie be the main cast.

it is really easy actually, give the fans what they want, instead coming up with your own imagination of how things should be."
Always a Witch,"Willow is trash, forget about it."
Always a Witch,Unfortunately the show is flaming hog wart dung
Always a Witch,"For me, Willow was quite atrocious. 

The acting, delivery, music choice. I literally only like 2 of the characters, I hated Willow himself with a passion and to me, his acting was incredibly subpar. There were a couple of scenes that I enjoyed, but I won’t shed a tear if the show doesn’t get renewed. It was overall quite bad."
Always a Witch,"It is a fun fantasy. An enjoyable mixture of action, romance and drama, with plenty of jokes. It seems like a three season arc is planned, if the Disney plus drops it, I would like to see it completed in comics or novels."
Always a Witch,Can't wait to see the new adventures of Strong Female Character and Ginger Plank of Wood..Riveting stuff!
Always a Witch,If there was ever a show that SHOULD be cancelled it’s Willow.
Always a Witch,"Willow is horrible. I hope fantasy/scifi shows like this keep failing, while more shows like Andor and HoTD succeed. Course correction is needed."
Always a Witch,"Willow was always a classic

couldn't stomach more then 3 episodes of that dog shit

wow"
Always a Witch,This was another huge misfire. Identity politics is all these people care about. They latch onto an existing IP like leeches and then bastardize it.
Always a Witch,this show needs to not be renewed.
Always a Witch,"To people who actually finish it, was it good?  I only made it to episode two and had to turn it off."
Always a Witch,The last two episodes of the first season were so bad that I don't feel like Season 2 anymore
Always a Witch,This was awful. Such a disappointment. I stopped watching. Shame
Always a Witch,Ron howard produced this fucking trash?
Always a Witch,"I loved the hell out of this show.
Willow was one of my childhood favorites, because it was so weird and wonky but fun and adventurous.
I still remember picking up sticks in high school and saying “uuuussse theee waaaaaand Willow!” to make people laugh. 
Hope it gets a second season."
Always a Witch,"I forgave everything about the series until Money for Nothing kicked in. Great song , terrible choice."
Always a Witch,I really disliked the first episodes and then someone told me to change the perspective. Since then I think of it as the attempt from a GM to run a Grimdark adventure and the players having other ideas. After that change I enjoyed it really
Always a Witch,"Hey Ron:  Maybe make season two of ""Willow"" be about *Willow*."
Always a Witch,Haha. Shoulda made a good show if you wanted to keep this job Ronnie.
Always a Witch,"I am sure that a majority of the people saying that they didn’t like the series genuinely didn’t like it based on their perception of its merits or lack there of

However I think it should be kept in mind that a large minority of the people saying that they didn’t like the series are saying that because a large part of the story was dedicated to a lesbian romance

Due to that one fact alone most conservative people are not going to like this series but few of them will come right out and admit that that is a reason for them not liking it"
Always a Witch,"There’s either a ton of shills or bots in this thread, I can’t quite figure out which."
Always a Witch,I really enjoyed the series. I rooted for the characters. It garnered my full attention.
Always a Witch,I saw the trailer & knew I would actively avoid it. Then I hear it’s obsessed with modern politics over story once it’s out & count my blessings I never wasted the time.  A damn shame as fond memories of the original.
Always a Witch,"The Wheel of Time, Lotr and now Willow. All terrible adaptations. We are truly living in the dark ages of fantasy genre on TV."
Always a Witch,"The show was trash.

Bunch of annoying brats."
Always a Witch,Narrator: There was no hope or plan but no one bothered to tell Gob .
Always a Witch,"A Willow TV show is a cool concept, but this tv show doesn’t meet expectations. The problem with the first season is that it shoe horns the distopian fantasy genre into Willow and it feels kinda hallow and lacks the worldbuilding the movie had. The film was also more of an epic fantasy."
Always a Witch,"I really get baffled when I see the critiques of this show on reddit. I had never seen the movie so I watched it before jumping into the show. If you saw the movie, you knew Willow was a bit of a misfit and the show itself is a band of misfits that both equally get themselves into and out of trouble through both their strengths and weaknesses. Do I think the pacing was off in some episodes? Absolutely. But the people basically expecting Disney Lord of The Rings or Game of Thrones clearly never saw the movie and are just offering extreme critiques for the sake of offering extreme critiques."
Always a Witch,A no for me. Not after you convince the Former CEO to cancel the Owl House for this.
Always a Witch,"Shit, I better go watch it so they know I like it!"
Always a Witch,"The show was just ok, but it felt like it just wasn’t that great.  It felt like it was maybe catering to the wrong audience, instead of focusing on making a great show."
Always a Witch,"Is it bad if, at this point, if I see Erin Kellyman I just assume it's going to be bad? Not sure why, but she's basically an albatross for Disney shows and movies."
Always a Witch,Good luck with that Ron.
Always a Witch,I didn’t enjoy it at all. The writing was terrible and the acting subpar.
Always a Witch,"My favorite movie growing up and I watched every episode of the show. I can see why people don't like it because it has weird edits and abrupt plot stuff, but I don't think the show took itself too seriously so I didn't either."
Always a Witch,It’s an incredibly bad show. Shockingly poor.
Always a Witch,"Wow what a disgrace to your legacy to put your name attached to this project, Ron"
Always a Witch,Why are the heroes in today's series always women? Really boring. And unrealistic
Always a Witch,"I managed to watch the entirety of She Hulk so I thought hey, I can watch this, plus top bloke Warwick is always a bonus. nope, an absolute dumpster fire, left midway episode 4, shows where literally everything in it is shit are a sight to behold but even such a sight has its limits"
Always a Witch,"Fugghedaboutit. 

I bet the ratings are terrible right now and I hardly hear anyone praise it. Even those who ""kind of like it"" warn you it's boring and slow."
Always a Witch,"I hope not, a real disappointment"
Always a Witch,I definitely needed more LGBTQ drama in my Willow reboot
Always a Witch,"Hmmm... So i've been reading some of the responses here - I can totally see why people were a bit ""disappointed""  and maybe I have low expectations (For instance, I liked Rings of Power and hope to get more seasons of that)  

Willow, which I have not finished yet!  On episode... 7 - but Willow... Has been a bit of a rollercoaster.  Semi slow start, gets really dark and entertaining, but have some slow episodes in between.  The episode I'm watching now has taken me a few days to complete haha, but I enjoy it so far.  I want to see more.  I think there definitely can be improvements.  

I'm recommending it to everyone even though I know they'll never watch it, just like I did with Patriot (And now that show is canceled because of my stupid friends and coworkers not taking my advice to watch grrrrr)"
Always a Witch,"I hope not. This is the series literally no one wanted. It's so fucking bad.  Like dragon ball evolution and Velma bad.

Edit: You people's taste in entertainment scares me."
Always a Witch,Does he have COVID?
Always a Witch,I can't be the only one who doesn't give a shit about old 80's/90's re-hashes of barely popular movies. Let's get over this whole nostalgia phase and get some original content for once.
Always a Witch,Renew Willow and drop that garbage show they call national treasure.
FLCL Alternative / Progressive,so the english dub came out 5 months before the japanese...... that must be a fuckin record. 
FLCL Alternative / Progressive,Now we live world they Duds release before than the subs. Weird of thinking about this. 
FLCL Alternative / Progressive,Fuck me....that sucks. Glad I taped the dub marathon of season 1 last week
FLCL Alternative / Progressive,"It's partly because it's a co-production between the Japanese company and adult swim, thus they're working on this series together and can make dubs quicker than normal."
FLCL Alternative / Progressive,I think D.I.C.E. holds that record. It debuted in English about a year before it started airing in Japanese.
FLCL Alternative / Progressive,"""So, that stuff all the actors said for the dub - did anyone write that down?""

""Awwww, shit."""
FLCL Alternative / Progressive,It's come full circle. Kind of a mind fuck when you remember back when anime dubs were always seasons behind the original Japanese version.
FLCL Alternative / Progressive,huh cool. i vaguely remember that show
FLCL Alternative / Progressive,"I agree, first 4-5 seasons were excellent. After that, it felt like they needed to keep increasing the intensity and made questionable decisions. This happens to many of these shows. 

The procedurals like Grey's Anatomy, NCIS, etc have it easier."
FLCL Alternative / Progressive,"I watched every single episode of this series until the end. To me, it started to go downhill the Leviathan season and what they did to my Bobby Singer. I'm loyal, but I'm honest. There were ups and downs after season 5, but truly, the worst thing they could have done was what they did to Bobby. Ingents."
FLCL Alternative / Progressive,"Yup. But I personally wouldn't have wanted it cancelled at season 5, cause we had some really banger episodes in later seasons (weekend at Bobby's comes to mind)  
 
So now whenever I do rewatches I go straight through 1-5, then start skipping around to the good stuff for the rest"
FLCL Alternative / Progressive,"The problem with the show in the later seasons is definitely the over reliance on goofy characters. In previous seasons, demons and angels were considered a threat and could be imposing. Then in the later seasons, they become ineffectual comic relief. Every side character becomes a goofy caricature with an over the top accent. The people they meet are cartoons for the most part and the acting is terrible. Sam and Dean also become a bit goofy as well, especially Sam, who’s acting method seems to be simply a large variety of facial ticks and stuttering grunts. Jensen Ackles has too much charisma to be too bad, he’s always watchable but for the most part he becomes a goofy guy as well. The beginning seasons have comedic moments that are pretty good and used sparingly, but they really lean into it in the later seasons and lose all the horror that the early seasons had."
FLCL Alternative / Progressive,Yes. I truly pretend season 6-15 never existed and just appreciate seasons 1-5 for what they are. It’s a great five season arc.
FLCL Alternative / Progressive,"I was kind of obsessed at the time, and really worried they would cancell it before the planned ending on season 5. 

Although, looking back, I think the introduction of angels took a lot of the original charm, it was really good TV"
FLCL Alternative / Progressive,"I definitely grew to miss that really dark aesthetic of the early seasons. I remember a later episode where they're with Rowena rounding up souls in this suburban Canadian neighborhood and it was *so bright* outside. Like distractingly so. 

(It was also one of the few episodes that was very obviously in Canada because the street signs were unlike any I'd seen in the US. But I digress)"
FLCL Alternative / Progressive,"They jumped so many sharks, they had to reuse sharks."
FLCL Alternative / Progressive,"The first season is rough. I love it, I have seen it several times, I can watch any episode but the first season is rough. Like Stargate SG-1 it takes time until it becomes a diamond."
FLCL Alternative / Progressive,"You are correct and there is a clear reason for all of what you said: Kripke only planned the series to be 5 seasons. This is why people call the season 5 finale the “original ending”. But with Supernatural being CW’s most successful show, CW wanted the show to continue. Kripke obliged but he also stepped down as showrunner, and other people took over running the show post season 5. So seasons 6-15 is basically just repetitive season arc’s of fan service, whereas seasons 1-5 had a serialized story that all tied together. The only good thing to come out of seasons 6-15 is >!the confirmation that Chuck is God!<, a lot of fans theorized it before, but if the show had ended after season 5 we never would’ve known for sure."
FLCL Alternative / Progressive,"It's a good example of how to transition from ""case of the week"" to overarching storyline in a seamless and exciting way. Still a B-show at best for me, but it was fun when I was a teenager! I never continued after season 5."
FLCL Alternative / Progressive,"With these long-running shows that went downhill in the end it can sometimes be easy to forget there was a time when they were excellent, and that's why they ran long in the first place. Looking at you Arrow."
FLCL Alternative / Progressive,I hate how they literally wrote in plot armor for them into the series.  It cheapened the whole series.
FLCL Alternative / Progressive,The series originally was only planned for 5 seasons.
FLCL Alternative / Progressive,"I always wish it had been cancelled after 5. It would have gone down as a great show, not hokey fan service. And maybe Jared wouldn’t have become so unbearable."
FLCL Alternative / Progressive,I know people love this show I just don't see it.
FLCL Alternative / Progressive,"I'm going through Supernatural now for the first time and I'm halfway through season 7 at the moment. I actually think season 6 is a contender for my favourite. Even though it's clear they juggled several plots that they struggled to interconnect, it has several of my favourite episodes of the whole shows, less Sam and Dean conflict (which was played out by that point anyway) and the best part: more Bobby. Bobby is far and away the best character in Supernatural, so having more of him was only a good thing. Season 7 is a noticeable downgrade.

There's a lot of season 1 and 2 that feels very simple, which is to be expected when you're starting a new show and building up a mythology. It's like early episodes of Buffy or The X-Files (and probably a dozen other shows), with the monster of the week format and finding out how to kill them. Kind of like a police procedural but with monsters. When they start to delve into heaven and hell, then I think it starts to hit its stride (Kurt Fuller is great). I'm a lot less interested when it's just constant brother drama.

The problem is that I don't really care about Sam and Dean (*especially* Dean) but some of the side characters are great. So far, I think the episodes and seasons focused on Bobby and Castiel are some of the best ones (which is why I like season 6 so much) and it's disappointing they didn't make the most of Ellen, Jo, Ash, Rufus and more."
FLCL Alternative / Progressive,"Is it ""extremely good""? Or is it ""extremely good for a CW show""? There's a big difference. I remember this sub telling me *The Arrow* was 'extremely good', which caused all confidence in that channel to be lost."
FLCL Alternative / Progressive,"More than 10 years since I watched those first 5 seasons and it's still a top favorite of mine.

Somewhere around season 10 was when I stopped watching it weekly. I caught up whenever I had a couple of episodes to binge. After 11 I didn't want to continue anymore. I started a rewatch during that hiatus and I was shocked to finally notice how far the quality had dropped with those later seasons.

After that I came across youtube clips here and there so I have a general idea what the last 4 seasons were like. I did watch the season 15 penultimate episode though and it was just complete garbage. The cgi was so bad the show looked like shit. It looked much better in the earlier seasons. And that was 15 years earlier!

I still watch Kripke's run every other year or so."
FLCL Alternative / Progressive,Agreed. The story was told by the end of Season 5. Personally I hated the angels and especially Castiel who was played by an extremely bad actor. He was okay in 4 and 5 but anything after that involving him or the angels was tedious to get through. It was so clearly not working anymore that they wrote him out at one point but ended up bringing him back because of the backlash from (I presume) viewers who thought he was hot.  Sam was a bad actor too but the chemistry with Dean helped offset his bad acting even though I think he actually got worse as the show went on. Supernatural was a great show for the first 5 seasons but the other seasons and focus on Castiel tarnished it.
FLCL Alternative / Progressive,"Yeah, there's a lot of good stories that could be told post-Season 5, but the post-Season 5 we got usually just did the worst possible version of each of those stories. Case in point, how do you go bigger than the devil? You could go with the living embodiment of chaos, the Leviathan. And post-Season 5 of Supernatural did that! ...But it wasn't just the one Leviathan, it was multiple leviathans, and they had nothing to do with the chaos dragon of lore or any sort of leviathan mythos really, instead just being virtually immortal versions of an enemy the brothers have already fought multiple times.

What gets me though is that Kripke was still writing on the show in Season 6. Yes, he was no longer the head writer, but he was still consulting, directly writing a couple of episodes, and was apparently okay with all of the lore inconsistencies and plot holes that Season 6 produced (unless he only had knowledge about the episodes he was working on and not any of the others).

Because of that and the low points of the Carver era, I think I would still be skeptical of a post-S5 new Kripke era even though those first five seasons were amazing."
FLCL Alternative / Progressive,"While I agree that 1-5 amazing, there were a few standalone seasons that were also very good. I think it's season 11 where they are trying to stop Gods sister, and that was a banger. A redeemed Metatron trying to convince Chuck not to give up on humanity is peak Supernatural.

Of course, then they completely ruin that excellence with the plot twist involving God in the last season.

I think the show had two perfect series finales, S5 and S11. The actual finale got ruined by COVID, so I'd cut them some slack if the rest of the season wasn't terrible."
FLCL Alternative / Progressive,"Money is a helluva drug. 

I pretty much tell anyone interested in the show “watch seasons 1 through 5, pause the last episode of season 5 at the end right when the camera is outside of the house, and pretend that’s where the series ended and 6-15 aren’t real.”"
FLCL Alternative / Progressive,Is it just me who feels supernatural and Smallville are bizarrely similar in later seasons??
FLCL Alternative / Progressive,"I would hardly call ""extremely good"", it was alright

the show was always B tier/CW silliness, especially after season 1"
FLCL Alternative / Progressive,"Extremely good?  I mean come on.  They are OK.  Its a good thing to have on in the background while you're doing something else.  Its B level quantity over quality television, which is fine.  There's nothing really outstanding about it.  Its entertaining enough, but the writing, acting, cinematography, are all pretty meh."
FLCL Alternative / Progressive,"It's difficult to recommend people to just watch 5 seasons out of a 15 season show on good faith. Yet new people will get a bit afraid seeing a 15 season show to pick up, specially one with so many episodes.

Loved those first 5 seasons and the whole 15 were good overall but gee, makes it difficult to recommend the show."
FLCL Alternative / Progressive,"It's actually 2 - 5.  Originally, the brothers weren't meant to continue.  It was going to be a anthology series at first. Their chemistry on screen is what made them stop telling a story about the world with these characters in it, and more about these characters interacting with the world.  Also the budget significantly increases in the second season.  If you watch the end of Season 1, it ends with a car crash with generic ass music playing on the radio.  Season 2 starts and its playing a licensed Ted Nugent song."
FLCL Alternative / Progressive,"It's a good YA show, but it doesn't hold up against other top TV shows. 

Swap Jensen Ackles and Jared Padalecki out for less attractive leads and the show loses a large portion of its female fanbase."
FLCL Alternative / Progressive,Wasn't Ben Edlund responsible for the show's uptick (ha!) In quality on seasons 2-5?
FLCL Alternative / Progressive,"There are a lot of good episodes in seasons 1-2, but I’ve always felt like the writers strike forcing a shorter season 3 was hugely beneficial. Made them cut out any filler and focus more on the larger plot.

Season 3 also gave us Ghostfacers, so on that alone it’s my favorite."
FLCL Alternative / Progressive,"Some good with a lot of meh is a perfect description of the seasons post Lucifer prophecy aka season 6 and onward. I honestly enjoy the over arcing narratives of each season, but wow are there a lot of 'skip' moments in each season/episode. Basically any time Sam and Dean start arguing and then later make up became instant skip scenes. At that point they served no narrative purpose beyond starting and episode with drama and ending the episode with a flimsy disagreement conclusion that set them back to their basic positions. 


As a side note, im still annoyed with how they built up Eve, made super monsters, and then just brushed it all away in about 5 minutes of scene time.


While I personally didnt like the final confrontation, I was fine with the finale/ send-off. But yes the first 5 seasons are quite good and season 5 is one that I occasionally go back to and watch again. Mark Pellegrino was a fantastic Lucifer for the earlier seasons."
FLCL Alternative / Progressive,I think there was a drop in quality after Eric Kripke left the show
FLCL Alternative / Progressive,"Just finished a full series rewatch myself and I was thinking the same thing about the back ten seasons, but at the same time I really respect them just for going for it yknow?

A lot of people say they hated the Leviathans but honestly that whole ""arc"" for lack of a better term is probably my favorite just because it was amazing to me that they actually managed to find a new villain after the massive shark jump that was lucifer

And although it started to get stale after awhile everytime they managed to pull a new bad guy out of their asses I was honestly floored

Like when Dean massacred the house of frankstein that was pretty dumb, and when there was that one episode about the monster families that run Chicago that never came up again, I was rolling my eyes at that pretty hard but just the charm of jumping the shark and then finding a larger shark to jump over never wore off on me"
FLCL Alternative / Progressive,"I put the writing of 1-5 of supernatural against any TV show, and it holds up.

I look at it as 6-15 is just a different show. 1-5 takes itself reasonably seriously, 6-15 is fun popcorn television."
FLCL Alternative / Progressive,"I think the only season I skipped in full was season 10. My least favourite choice in the show will always be the dragon copout, too."
FLCL Alternative / Progressive,"First 2 seasons were close to x-files ""monster of the week"". Then when we got close to the characters they added epic story."
FLCL Alternative / Progressive,End last ep of season 5 as it starts to pan away from Dean having a meal with his adopted family and it's perfect.
FLCL Alternative / Progressive,Dean telling Sam what he did while he was in hell is one of the best scenes in TV
FLCL Alternative / Progressive,"Agreed... and disagreed. As much as I love SPN season 1-5, I wouldn't say I like how the female characters in it were written. Save Bela. Bela was fucking awesome.

Then again I also don't like how the female characters are written in 6-15 so... Yeah, I really don't know how to feel about the whole show regarding that."
FLCL Alternative / Progressive,"I do agree season 1-5 are the best the show has I really liked season 6-11 and imo season 11 works as a series finale too.

12-15 while weaker I still liked them I thought god as the villian was cool but he didn't really do much in season 15 the whole bringing back old creatures was dealt with swiftly.

granted God being evil was abit left field 

the show finale while not the best I still enjoyed it"
FLCL Alternative / Progressive,"Yeah Power creep, they beat the devil so the next baddie has to be more powerful, and then the next one, etc.

I still enjoy the later seasons for the monster-of-the-week episodes but almost all of the plotlines are weak."
FLCL Alternative / Progressive,"I used to go on the subreddit and speculate how certain seasons would wind up, and I was always wrong because they would just keep getting more and more ridiculous and then a bigger enemy would emerge in the last episode and one of the brothers would disappear. That show had so much potential for good stories but it became fanservice schlock."
FLCL Alternative / Progressive,"Near the end of the leviathan stuff is when I stopped, good to know I didn't miss out on anything."
FLCL Alternative / Progressive,And then they brought Bobby back! Not the same Bobby but still! I’m guessing they got a lot of backlash killing Bobby off (and the way they did it) and found a way to bring him back and thought everything would be square lol
FLCL Alternative / Progressive,"''The French Mistake'', ''Baby'' and ''ScoobyNatural''. Fantastic episodes."
FLCL Alternative / Progressive,Seasons 1-5 are the Winchester Gospel. Seasons 6-15 are the apocrypha.
FLCL Alternative / Progressive,"I actually didn't finish season 15. I got halfway through and gave up when I heard the ending had been horrible. I read the synopsis of the remaining episodes and it was just a weird way to end it. Having rewatched 1-5, it makes way more sense to stop there and pretend it actually ended there."
FLCL Alternative / Progressive,And one episode was called jump the shark.
FLCL Alternative / Progressive,"The problem with season one on streaming is that it’s the only season without the original music used in the show. So you’ll have moments of Dean rocking out to a rock song, but it’s the not the song that was originally in the show so they have to edit it weird."
FLCL Alternative / Progressive,"After a quick scroll on IMDB i'll give you Bloody Mary, Hook Man, Bugs and Route 666 but I think the rest are watchable to great, even something like The Benders sets up the trope of human enemies always being gross bastards. 18 outta 22 ain't bad."
FLCL Alternative / Progressive,Yeah it took a while for them to figure out the right balance of monster of the week with serialized story. As a whole it's good but you can pick it apart pretty easily episode by episode and ultimately the monster of the week stuff just falls short. The real redeeming factor of the show was that serialized story and you sat through the monster of the week to see the weekly 5 minutes of progression for the overarching plot.
FLCL Alternative / Progressive,"We went to a Supernatural fan panel at a convention. It was our first con and we thought it would be fun. I forget how my husband ended up with the mic, but he said, well we all know Chuck is God. 

Holy crap was the response not what I expected. Half the room cheered in agreement, the other half grumbled and there were a few boos. One of the panelists wanted to know what led him to believe that. It was obvious she disagreed, and a guy in the audience went on about how how was a Christian and Chuck being God would be disrespectful to Christianity. All I could think was, do you even watch the show?

It was realty wild to see so many people refuse to believe it, and then the big reveal happened. I really liked Chuck being God. Everything after with his character was uneven to downright disappointing."
FLCL Alternative / Progressive,The powerhouse they had at Thursday night I believe with Smallville leading into Supernatural made them a ton of money. It’s not surprising they would milk it even after the creators were out of story.
FLCL Alternative / Progressive,"And that is why they were the best seasons. Still one of the greatest shows in years in terms of music and art direction. 

I get so angry about the Sera Gamble seasons. Big bad talked about in first couple episodes then forgotten and defeated in the last 1-2 episodes. 

Carver wasn't too bad. 

I popped back for the Men of Letters season when Mary was brought back.

Edit to add: I feel bad for everyone who watched it later via streaming after the original music was stripped out. The classic rock used went with the story in most cases and when it was switched it didn't feel the same. I can only watch it on bluray at this point otherwise there is much rage."
FLCL Alternative / Progressive,"Honestly i disagree. While it obviously went downhill after season 5 we still got some amazing and fun episodes along the way up to season 15 that we would have missed. Like my all time favorite one ""The French Mistake"" in season 6. Just that episode alone makes Season 6 worth watching."
FLCL Alternative / Progressive,"Extremely good for a network TV show, not just CW. If you have issues with network TV, those issues are still present. If you don't, it's a fantastic time."
FLCL Alternative / Progressive,"You have a point, but I personally think it's just a solid show for any network (specifically season 1-5). There is a super cringe part of the fandom that overlaps with The Arrow fans that think that stuff was good. I gave The Arrow a shot after hearing the accolades and it was the most meh piece of TV. The latter years of SPN catered extremely hard to these cringe fans (where the early seasons actually made fun of them). I honestly think Twitter/Tumbler fandoms have ruined many shows because a show gets popular so creators turn to the internet to see what the fans are saying and the most hardcore ones are living there creating the absolute dumbest piece of fanfic possible with everyone praising it. 

The WB/CW was a good melodrama network for teens and young adults and then it turned into PG13 Nickelodeon shows."
FLCL Alternative / Progressive,"I think post-5 Kripke was collecting checks and helping the team transition without him. I mean they literally kill him in one episode. After that, he seemed to just get residuals and drop in every now and then. The writing was just terrible after he left though. I know he didn't personally write that many episodes in 1-5, but his showrunning direction must have been what kept things grounded and on a consistent course. 

He seems to be running the Boys like he did SPN and I think that's making people anxious. A big criticism of The Boys season 3 is that it ended just like it started and nothing really changed, just a lot of build up for nothing. To me that's exactly what happened in season 3 of SPN with Dean actually dying and going to hell. He seems to still write like he would for a network TV show instead of a streaming service, and he's said that he's planning to go to season 5 with the Boys. I think he's got good ideas and knows how to string stories along to keep them interesting until they can reach a final episode and come to a conclusion. I'd bet he'd be able to develop a well rounded epilogue to season 5 SPN if he got the chance."
FLCL Alternative / Progressive,"For me the only stand-out late season was 12, when the villains went from being angels and demons to just… the English. Such a weird choice but I enjoyed the change."
FLCL Alternative / Progressive,1000%
FLCL Alternative / Progressive,Probably cuz they reuse the same local Canadian actors.
FLCL Alternative / Progressive,"You gotta treat it like I did Arrow. It was a shame they canceled it after 2 seasons. I still have such rage over black canary in s3e1.

It's such a shame SPN got canceled after 5 seasons."
FLCL Alternative / Progressive,"You just have to explain to the people that you're recommending the show to that it's not really a 15 season show. It's more like a 5 season show with a 6 season sequel show which has its own 4 season sequel show. And the sequel shows just retained the title of the original show. But you can jump off at the end of Season 5, the end of Season 11, or the end of Season 15 and still get a full story."
FLCL Alternative / Progressive,I wouldn't call Bad Moon Rising by CCR generic ass music.
FLCL Alternative / Progressive,"I think the anthology series was an idea that got dropped before the pilot even shot. Kripke wanted the scary stories to be front and center with a couple of reporters going around capturing them, but when the studio disliked that he pitched the idea of them being brothers. I think he fleshed out a couple seasons at a time, waiting to see if they would be able to continue before writing any cliffhangers."
FLCL Alternative / Progressive,"Maybe. I followed Padiwhack over from Gilmore Girls. Mainly, I was there for the monster of the week with the supernatural twists. Horror is my bread and butter. 

Even better was the classic rock music. So much good music in those early seasons."
FLCL Alternative / Progressive,"Yea, and he stayed until season 8 but I think he worked better with Kripke there than when he wasn't."
FLCL Alternative / Progressive,"OMFG, I swear it's because Sera Gamble forgot who her big bad for that season was. So much potential just forgotten."
FLCL Alternative / Progressive,"I've never really understood this criticism about the female characters. I understand that many times there was a ""damsel in distress"" type character week to week that Dean usually hit on (especially in the early episodes), but they never seemed purposefully written to be a bad stereotype and his advances were usually batted down and he was made to look like a fool.

Jo and Ellen showed up early in the series and appeared a number of times. Each time they held their own against the bad guys and all of the male characters seemed to respect them.

Ruby and Meg were both demons and did demon things and it never seemed like they were written poorly (just maybe acted poorly at times).

Sheriff Jody Mills helps defeat the bad guy after her family was killed.

Bela was well written and beat the guys quite a bit.

These were all season 5 and earlier characters. I think the overall issue is that there wasn't a prominent female character that lasted a long time. Most of them showed up every now and then, but not like Bobby, Crowley, and Castiel who were often in episode after episode. There's only so much room for the regular cast and they'd already settled into a very male-centric show. Two brothers + dad, then two brothers + Bobby, then two brothers + Bobby and a male angel, then two brothers + Bobby and a male angel and a male demon. They seemed to try to rectify this with Rowena and Mary later on, but those episodes were already meh. The crux of the matter is that the show started off as very hetero-focused with Dean being a womanizer. So any woman that was introduced was already being ogled at by one of the main characters. Dean even sleeps with an angel in one episode and Sam sleeps with a werewolf in another episode. The early seasons had women showing up who would eventually swoon for the main characters, except for the ones I listed above. So I think instead of bucking that trend, they just didn't put effort into casting a series regular woman in any role."
FLCL Alternative / Progressive,"I loved the series throughout the entire run, but the power creep was pretty hilarious.

They kill literal death, and eventually they kill the actual omniscient omnipresent God, despite having no actual powers.

FLCL Alternative / Progressive,"Until eventually they literally killed Death, Lucifer, and even God. It got pretty silly (I still enjoyed the later seasons, but I also know they were ridiculous and not as good as the beginning)"
FLCL Alternative / Progressive,"The extremely meta ""The French Mistake"" in Season 6 is one of the best episodes of a show taking the piss out of its actors, storylines, and fans. There's a reason those gifs are still used today."
FLCL Alternative / Progressive,"Yeah, that's when I called it quits as well. The leviathans were hyped up so much, then were completely depowered by the end of the season. The first red flag was when they pulled that same shit with Castiel already."
FLCL Alternative / Progressive,Just think; that's about half way through the series. Woof.
FLCL Alternative / Progressive,"The single thing I recommend going back for is the Scooby-Doo crossover because it's a standalone.

FLCL Alternative / Progressive,Bugs was the very first episode I watched haha
FLCL Alternative / Progressive,Rob Benedict confirmed that Chuck is God back in 2011 at a convention. He even said that Kripke and other writers/producers asked him how it felt to play God.
FLCL Alternative / Progressive,"Season 11 had Metatron call Chuck God's meatsuit and that the nebbishness of his personality belonged to Chuck, not God. To me that leaves the door open to either interpretation.

Either:

1) At the beginning of time God knew how everything in the future would play out, knew when the apocalypse would be triggered, and created his angels with the name of a ""prophet"" on the inside of their eyelids that he always knew he would disguise himself as one day. Then when it came time for that ""prophet"" to be born, he paused the prophet-creation mechanic so that no new prophet would be born during Chuck's lifetime, blinded the archangel who was assigned to watch Chuck so that he wouldn't see that God was letting himself be born as Chuck (or came into being as an adult Chuck and simply rewrote Raphael's memories so that he didn't realize he never watched Chuck being born and growing up). And then he pretended to have headaches to pass himself off as a prophet. Then after Raphael had died, he continued pretending to have headaches when no one was around to see him simply because he had gotten that into the character of Chuck. He then left Earth for a while and restarted the prophet-creation mechanic. Then he returned to Earth, had sex with some of his creations that he considers his children, eventually talked to Metatron, and through his conversation with Metatron decided that he wanted to be a writer who told the truth. So he helped the brothers defeat Amara (but possibly lied about Gabriel's death), and then left Earth with her for a while. Then he came back to Earth and decided he instead wanted to be a writer who lies in order to be the best writer of all time. He cooked up ways to torture the brothers, but even though he was able to foresee the apocalypse at the beginning of time, he couldn't foresee the brothers' plans to defeat him. And then the brothers left him alive even though he still has all of his knowledge of magic and powered-artifacts that would let him return as a threat in the future.

or

2) Chuck was an actual human prophet that was born to human parents. His name was written on the inside of the angels' eyelids from the beginning of time. He helped the brothers, and in the Season 5 finale God began using him as a vessel. God began taking on Chuck's memories as his own and pretending that Chuck's experiences were his experiences. When Metatron confronted him about this charade, he led God to the conclusion that he didn't want to be Chuck anymore, he wanted to be a writer who told the truth. So he helped the brothers defeat Amara and then merged with her at the end of Season 11. God's light softened Amara, allowing her to appreciate creation, but Amara's darkness corrupted Chuck, feeding his ego and narcissism, and allowed Chuck to gain control of God and his powers. So now instead of God pretending to be Chuck, it was Chuck pretending to be God. And Chuck had no qualms about being a writer who lies if it meant he would be recognized as the greatest writer ever. But because Chuck isn't God, he didn't have full access to all of God's powers. He wasn't able to see how the brothers would defeat him. And once he was defeated, he didn't have God's knowledge of magic or artifacts that would allow him to become a threat to the brothers ever again.

Personally I think the second option makes more sense and gives the story a better conclusion, but I think people are welcome to go with the first interpretation if they choose.

That said, Kripke confirmed that Chuck wasn't always planned to be God. They were still trying to figure out how they wanted to portray God when they were writing the back half of Season 5, and Kripke confirmed that God hadn't appeared in the show yet at that time even though Chuck had appeared in Season 4 and three episodes of Season 5."

FLCL Alternative / Progressive,"Okay, I don't know about you but I feel like you and I watched 2 different shows. Spoileeeers.

>Jo and Ellen showed up early in the series and appeared a number of times. Each time they held their own against the bad guys and all of the male characters seemed to respect them.


In what sort of ways do you say they held their own?

Jo's first appearance was good but she didn't face off against any bad guys. Jo's second appearance had her kidnapped before Dean and Sam save her. Then she agrees to use herself as bait while the our two heroes trap him in a ring of salt. Third appearance has Meg tie her up and continually harrass her before Dean saves her. The only thing she does in the episode is save him from drowning but that's about it. Fourth appearance has War making her think a demon entered her mother and finally, she shows some combat skills, but she doesn't end up using them against any bad guys. 

And finally, fifth appearance has her finally showing that she's all grown by... once again using herself as bait and Sam and Dean go to steal the colt back from Crowley. Now, she does end up saving Dean but she never manages to kill either of those two dogs, her mother did. She may have been the one who gave the idea of having them blow up the shop while Sam and Dean leave but that's way too late and it was while on her deathbed.

Jo's whole arc is that she wants her mother to see her as a full fledged hunter. As someone who can take care of herself without her mother needing to babying her. But we don't get any sort of acknowledgment from her.

Ellen isn't any better. Good first appearance but no bad guys. Second appearance has her decide to go with Bobby, Sam and Dean before Jake Tally decides to use her as a hostage make her turn her gun to her head. She's does end up helping Bobby close the gate of hell but that's about all she does in that episode. Third appeareance has her being held down by her own daughter and after she managed to overpower her, she runs back to storage and leaves Sam with Jo and Rufus.

 And then there's her final episode. She may have been the one to take out the dogs but it was too late.

>Ruby and Meg were both demons and did demon things and it never seemed like they were written poorly (just maybe acted poorly at times).

 I'm not so sure about that. Yes, they were fine. But when you compare them to someone like Crowley, especially Ruby, it becomes clear that they only had one goal in mind. They never seemed to be fleshed out like he was.

Meg 1 and Meg 2 were fine.

Speaking of the demoness(es?), one thing I've noticed is that whenever a(male) demon is shown to be tortured, that almost always have their clothes on and mostly shown bloody and beaten. However, when Ruby is held by Alastair, she is shown naked with only a metal bar covering her nipples, much is the same way with Meg.

Jody and Bella were fine, I guess.

Female (recurring) characters you have mentioned from kripke era:

>Becky

A caricature of an obsessive fangirl. There's nothing nice to say about her.

>Anna

Man, did she get shafted soooo badly. I'm fully well aware of her potential and that her role was taken by Castiel because he was the fan's favorite but if there's any female character that was poorly written, it's her.

There was a post on SPN subreddit that explained what was wrong with what they had done to her. Here it is.

https://www.reddit.com/r/Supernatural/comments/101mfyo/anna_was_done_so_wrong_on_this_show/

>Lisa

She is there to primarily suit Dean's needs after what happened to Sam. As opposed to all the other love interests, she is not fleshed out well enough. Main thing out her is that she has a son named Ben, who's probably Dean's, had a one night stand with Dean and that's about it. Heck, we're supposed to believe he fell in love with her but we barely know anything about her. 

I don't mind having love interests but the fact that they're there primarily to suit them, never having their own arcs and struggles and even if they did, they just  aren't as complex as the other recurring characters were at when they were at season 5(Cas to Anna, Crowley to Ruby and Meg).

And that would leave us with 1 good female character, 3 evil female characters. Of all those four, only one of them lived on and it wasn't a love interest. 

That's my problem. Love interests are shown from the first episode to either die from being involved with the Winchesters(John to Mary, Sam to Madison and Jessica and Dean to Anna(although that was more of Castiel's fault))

And if you want a much more egregious example look no further further the finale, Sam's love interest is never shown her face. The mother of his children shown out of the shot because... uhhh
Ummm..."

Sparta,I would love to see a big budget show about Greek History (I am Greek) so I am in. The war lasted for 27 years in total with some peace intervals so there is a lot of history to cover.
Sparta,Alcibiades would make for an amazing tv show but audiences would find his life unbelievable
Sparta,"I think it'd be possible, though a lot of the battle scenes would have to be trimmed down for budgetary reasons. I'd love to see the Sicillian expedition put on screen, with the siege of plataea, the Athenian plague and the Corcyran civil war all making for really interesting plotlines.

A main character would be pretty hard as the war was fought over two generations. Perecles was the most important Athenian in the early stage of the war, but long dead by the end. You'd could pick Thucydidies(As he wrote the extensive history on the war), but even he died before they ended. The other choice would be to have an unimportant Athenian citizen be the main character. That'd work pretty well as Athenians would have witnessed all the political wrangling, due to it being a democracy, and also witnessed a lot of fighting due to the armies being composed of citizens."

Sparta,"*All in the Family* was his superior role bar none. This scene was never 'syndicated' until *Archie Bunkers Place* earned it's space. This scene alone will leave you ugly crying with tissues and nose runnings you'll never be able to quantify.

Archie has already adopted Danielle Brisboise and has attended the funeral and gatherings at his own bar, within his own neighborhood after Edith has passed away. And then he goes home for [one last look](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvzJZJxSXao&t=162s) around their old bedroom after they've loaded Ediths belongings out of the house.

This scene alone gives you all the range you'd need to see O'Connor display to know this man was a master of his craft.

BONUS: The general population of the era was ***SO*** upset by this scene in particular that when Jean Stapleton (Edith) attended the Emmys after leaving the Bunkerverse, she had to reiterate to all attendees/viewers that she was in fact still alive.

It takes very special actors about to bring about that balance. I think really Jean Stapleton was the most impressive  - that performance was genius, but Carroll O Connor was very close behind - that was a very special and great sustained performance.

The thing about The Heat of the Night is it was a very 'conventional' show. There have been many like it. I can't say I watched it regularly but I'm sure he was good in it, its just not as unique."
Sparta,"O'Connor invented the Archie Bunker characterization from scratch - every mannerism, every speech pattern, every attitude, the entire look and feel. It was a bold, daring creation, playing an on-the-surface outrageous and sometimes awful character, leavened with a humanity and humor and interacting with other actors without hamming it up. It's textbook TV acting.

In the Heat of the Night is more enacting a character enacted by others, bringing some unique shading and star power, but not revelatory in any way."
Sparta,I'm a HotN person myself. But it always kind of makes me sad seeing Hugh & knowing what happened. \*for those who do not know Hugh O'Connor played Lonnie Jamison & was Carroll's adopted son. He committed suicide as a result that he did not think he could kick his drug habit.

Sparta,“I’m really quite a treat!”  🤣
Sparta,"My man LVid always shines in big events like this. He often is an award presenter, and comes up with funny stuff. He even owned one of the SNL 40th sketches by just saying ""No"".

Shame that he doesn't like to do stand-up anymore."
Sparta,"Larry, David, Steve and Martin all went to a bar..."

Sparta,I love this dude so much! Can’t wait for season 10 of Curb!
Sparta,Two of my biggest heroes. <3
Sparta,This man is an absolute legend 
Sparta,Larry > Jerry.
Sparta,"Christ, based on the title, I thought Steve Martin had died."
Sparta,I LOL'd more than I thought I was going to LOL.  
Sparta,I dont get it
Sparta,"Two legends! Lets see a Larry David with Steve Martin film!  I saw the Woody Allen and Larry David film which I thought would be great, it wasn't:(. My favorite Martin film has to be the Jerk (my apologies putting the wrong link the first time here is my cartoon review of the Jerk https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEn3GUhl6UQ ).  I would love to see The Jerk II!  Why not! Carl Reiner, Bernadette Peters, and of course Steve Martin is still with us! "
Sparta,Hahaha this is hilarious content  and I enjoyed it very much!!!
Sparta,This is not very funny 
Sparta,It's funny because is not true
Sparta,yeah like ages ago.
Sparta,I like LD but that wasn't funny. 
Sparta,Repost.

Sparta,He did these things. The Mark Twain prize winner...
Sparta,"This whole award show was concocted by Steve Martin to aggrandize himself - you know where he got the money for it? He stole the funds from cancer children hospitals. He hates cancer kids, says they give him the ""heebie jeebies"", and he emphasizes the word ""heeb"" for no reason whatsoever while he looks straight at me. Why would he do that?"
Sparta,I think it’s a bit.
Sparta,I'm like 99% sure it's a joke

Sparta,The song is from a 1970 Italian film called La Bellisima Estate:)
Sparta,It was funny
Sparta,"What's great about these speeches is the work that goes into them. It's relatively easy to get up there and talk about how great someone is, how they touched your lives. But Larry's shit talk speeches are the greatest of compliments. Each one is a performance. They take great writing and execution. They have that subtle Larry David humor, and that takes work. "
Sparta,The Jerk is also one of my all time favorites. But your “review” led me to church. And I feel bamboozled 
Sparta,"do you live in a world where a colloquialism for death is winning the Mark Twain Award?

Sparta,How
Defendant,Brian Griffin
Defendant,walt from breaking bad
Defendant,"BoJack Horseman. He doesn't *want* to be a bad person, but he doesn't put in the work to be a good person. So he goes through life being a bad person and feeling bad about it like that absolves him of anything."

People defend him for his redemption arc at the very end as if that erases 9+ seasons of being a dick >! oh and a LITERAL MURDERER !<"

So much so, the actor portraying him called fans out on it."
Defendant,Daemon Targaryen
Defendant,"Beth from Yellowstone. Woman is a toxic sociopath who manipulates her father like a spoiled rich girl. They all consider her a wild horse who just ""can't be tamed"", the true embodiment of if the song "" before he cheats"" was a real person.  But, in all honesty, without her father's money, she'd probably be in prison over a domestic violence dispute or arson."
Defendant,Haaaave you met Ted?
Defendant,eren yaeger
Defendant,"Alicent Hightower

I know it's a different society without our modern sensitivities, but her fans are still so weird for justifying what she does. They completely gloss over all the atrocious things she does in S1."
Defendant,"Klaus Mikaelson, and Elijah. Well, the whole family, really, but Rebecca was the best one."
Defendant,Rick from Rick and Morty
Defendant,I’ve recently learned that a lot of people don’t realize Homelander is a villain in The Boys.
Defendant,"Barney from HIMYM. A reprehensible person who was deeply misogynistic and terrible to the opposite sex. Especially in today’s presentism that’s happening when viewing our entertainment, it is surprising this character isn’t criticized more."
Defendant,Damon Salvatore
Defendant,"Michael Scott from the Office (as well as Dwight). Yes they're hilarious and yes both have humanizing/good moments, but the other 99% of the time they're horrible, selfish, racist, and aggravating people. And yet the fans take the good moments and act like they're both saints unappreciated in their time.

Weirdly, a lot of fans do the reverse for Jim and Pam, who are pretty good people that occasionally acted shitty, and yet those moments are held against them and used to argue that they're actually the worst people in the show (not even close)."
Defendant,Ray and his family “Everybody Loves Raymond”
Defendant,"Jamie Lannister. People were treating him as a hero near the end, forgetting that the show started when he casually pushed a kid out of a tower and made a joke because the kid had seen him having sex with his sister. 

And then the later part where he raped his sister over the corpse of their son."
Defendant,tommy shelby
Defendant,Ellen from the Ellen degeneres show
Defendant,Michael Scott!!!!
Defendant,Carrie from SatC
Defendant,Tony Soprano obviously
Defendant,"Don Draper. And I say that as one of his biggest defenders/apologists. But even if what he does is undertandible given his shitty background, many of his actions are objectively awful. One of the things that makes his character so fascinating is that he can be simultaneously infuriating and sympathetic."
Defendant,"Silco and Jinx from Arcane. People portray Silco as a antihero revolutionary and great/supportive parent instead of a power hungry drug lord and a toxic and manipulative father figure. They portray Jinx as a poor victim instead of an unstable terrorist. Worst of all, Vander and Vi are unfairly blamed for the people their respective siblings became. Silco and Jinx fans straight up pretend as if the two haven't repeatedly expressed a willingness to harm literally anyone outside a small handful of people they actually care for"
Defendant,"Geralt of Rivia is one of my favorite characters ever. I practically inhaled the games, the books, the show. I know why he is the way he is, and the experiences that made him that way. Living that long is bound to make someone aloof and detached. And he’s not as bad as most of the other people in his world. But I still think the way he treats Yennifer, Dandelion, and others is callous and unnecessary. Geralt needs to be nicer to his only friends in a world full of enemies. That’s why I loved it when Dandelion wrote an entire song about how shitty Geralt was to him, and got an entire bar to sing along. That song was a banger."
Defendant,"Barney from How I Met Your Mother. He’s awful. 

Currently re-watching Will and Grace too and Karen is so fucking racist 🙃"
Defendant,Sweet Dee Reynolds!
Defendant,"Lestat from Interview With The Vampire. Tumblr people projected on Lestat so hard and Twitter people- well, I didn't go back to Twitter after Episode 5 because I knew they would be feral"
Defendant,"Every single person on Yellowstone, especially Rip.

When you really look at everyone, every single person in that show is a bad person."
Defendant,Vic Mackey and the Strike Team (except Shane who was generally reviled by everyone).  The Shield had such a strange viewership where probably more than half rooted on the heinous acts of the main characters while also disliking or outright hating the legitimate good guys on the show because they were trying to hold Mackey accountable.
Defendant,Sheldon from BBT
Defendant,Jesse from breaking bad. The guy whines the whole series about feeling like shit for doing bad things while continuing to do bad things
Defendant,Spike
Defendant,"Tony Soprano. Love the show, but he’s an abusive murdering thug, but hey, he’s charismatic, so it’s okay.  Melfi was right to cut him off in the end."
Defendant,Vegeta. Dude has slaughtered billions.
Defendant,"I did not like what they did with Wanda between Wandavision and Multiverse. I liked the character up to that point, but everything Marvel did to her from then on felt like a character assassination."
Defendant,That Tiger King ghoul
Defendant,Literally any character from the Vampire Diaries. They're all mass murderers.
Defendant,Barry from Barry. He’s a murder and chooses to murder more and more people by the end of season 2 and going into season 3. He’s an extremely awful person
Defendant,Dexter
Defendant,Walter White is so trash. Probably a narcissist.
Defendant,Saul Goodman
Defendant,"The Salvatore Brothers from Vampire Diaries

First of all they are vicious murderers

Second of all they are hundreds of years old, Enjoy finding new girlfriends in Highschool, and if there not in Highschool seemingly only date girls under 20."
Defendant,"The Punisher. 

Wayy too many people idolize this murderous vigilante. I've seen punisher logos on cop cars ffs. 

He's not a hero, he's not a good guy. He's often just as bad as the ""bad guys"" he kills, who mind you, are entitled to lawyers, due process, and the chance of defending themselves."

Defendant,Just started season 4 so don’t spoil but I’m guessing Eren Yeager
Defendant,Frank Underwood
Defendant,Silco from arcane
Defendant,"Any character from a show centered around crime. The lead is always played up as a sympathetic character, but they’re out here murdering, selling drugs, cheating on their wife/girlfriend, and generally committing reprehensible acts of crime/violence.
And your local high school graduates who never moved are just eating it all up.
Jax from SoA is my favorite example."
Defendant,[deleted]
Defendant,"Daenerys Targaryen. Like I get the last season sucked for a lot of reasons but I am consistently amazed at the amount of people who thought that Dany performed some sort of heel turn in that final series.

Like that woman has been about over the top revenge the whole show. Like anytime she faces the slightest of resistance she just burns shit down. She was also never really that benevolent. She always demands advice from her advisors and then just ignores it when they tell her something she doesn't like. She only appeared to be a good guy cause she spent the first half of the show fighting slavers, but the moment she didn't need them anymore she flew off to westeros. Like those other slave cities were obviously gonna move in the moment she left."

Defendant,Detective vic mackey from the shield
Defendant,Rory Gilmore.
Defendant,"How about Monica Rambeau, who watched her do all of this and let it slide? She’s directly responsible for the events of MoM because had she incarcerated Wanda after the supreme fuckery she’d pulled, none of that would have happened and being held responsible for her actions publicly probably would have snapped her out of the self indulgent pity spiral that sent her down that path to begin with. 
Wanda isn’t a bad person, but she went to a bad place after losing Vision and she did bad things. Everyone around her chose to excuse and enable her though and that’s how we got MoM."
Defendant,Spike from Buffy the Vampire Slayer.  People defend him even after he tried to rape Buffy.
Defendant,"Johnny Lawrence ,Eli ,Tory and Miguel Diaz from Cobra Kai"
Defendant,"Pretty much any protagonist who is a straight up criminal. Tony Soprano, Walter White, Jax from Sons of Anarchy… it’s all “but they had good reasons!”"
Defendant,"Rachel Green. 

Especially here on reddit. Fans say she may not be that bad and the fact that she doesn't know any better. But I am looking at two moments where she was a sociopath. 

When she hired Tag because she had a crush on him and even took pictures of him for reasons. If she was a man it would be considered sexual harassment. 

When she stole Monica's porsche. It's theft. And she was breaking the law by speeding but her flirting with the officer got her out of a ticket. 

People think oh she is just a good person who made mistakes. No a good person owns up to their mistakes, and get consequences for it. Rachel took no responsibility for her actions and more often than not she got off free and things always worked her way. Which only fed her narcissistic personality"
Defendant,"Recently, Kit from Willow.

She starts off as obnoxious, entitled, narcissistic, rude, and self absorbed. Which is a good place to start with a character, have them humbled in a character arc.

But people were defending her and saying she was LIKEABLE in the first two episodes! It was one of the wildest versions of cogitative dissidence I've ever seen. Especially knowing that, if the character was a male with all the same attributes, he would be listed as ""toxic masculinity"".

Luckily the show's writing is so atrocious it single-handedly pushed their viewership into the dumpster, guaranteeing there will be no season 2."
Defendant,"Tory from Cobra Kai, and I fall guilty of this too"
Defendant,Don Draper
Defendant,Gilligan
Defendant,"This is what makes the Marvel series good. 

No, Wanda is not a good person. She's definitely one of Marvel's villians. But, as often with Marvel, characters are complex, and Wanda is VERY complex with her entire history. She may even become 'good' again later in the MCU timeline, even though she will keep this part of her history."
Defendant,"Emily from Gilmore girls.

 The older I get the more I understand her and will always stand behind her."
Defendant,"Rhaenyra House of Dragon. She’s a pretty shit person that does shit things who is wildly popular on Twitter and others of that ilk, which bleeds into Reddit, because it’s only fair that gals get to be despotic tyrants as well."

Defendant,Elon Musk from Twitter
Defendant,Montgomery de la Cruz from 13 Reasons Why.
Defendant,"Tony Danza, he knew Angela was in the shower"
Defendant,"The fact that she didn't do it on purpose means that it doesn't reflect on her morally. She's certainly not a *bad* person. It was accidental, and she wasn't in her right mind. This means she doesn't bear moral culpability."
Defendant,Rustin Cohle from True Detective Season 1
Defendant,"MCU Wanda was never a good person. She only stops working for Ultron when she discovers Ultron plans to kill her too; she joins the team of people who are fighting to ensure she's not held accountable for anything; okay she's fine in Infinity War; she tortures Thanos instead of just killing him and then we enter WandaVision and DSMoM.

You can see why hardcore Wanda fans from the comics really hate her adaptation."
Pose,"Performers? Think about what damage could be done, if politicians get deepfaked. That's a disaster in the making."
Pose,"I mean, technology is coming for most of our jobs whether we like it or not.  Better get that retirement fund pumped and do it fast."
Pose,You still need an actor to do a performance for a deepfake to work. They're basically just a digital mask.
Pose,"Reminds me of that episode of Bojack Horseman where he quits the movie, and they still got a digital replacement of him to fill in where he left lol"
Pose,I don’t understand why they couldn’t have just cast Sebastian Stan as Luke Skywalker. He looks exactly like a young Mark Hammil and even Hammil approved
Pose,"Actors becoming obsolete by deepfake replacements? lol.  

I mean at some point people will determine if they want to pay to see a real person giving a performance or a fake person giving a performance designed in a computer.  At some point when does a deepfake movie become an animation?"
Pose,"It's true that deepfakes pose a theat to livelihoods, but the cats out of the bag.   The technology is improving, there's no putting the cat back in the bag.

I wouldn't be surprised when we see celebrities license their deepfakes in the future because they can't be assed to perform the work themselves.   Sounds like something Marlon Brando would do back in the day actually if that was available back when he was acting."
Pose,"The bigger threat is to originality. Studios are not looking at Deepfakes to replace actors, they are looking to them to milk every last dollar from tired old properties, allowing them to make sequels, prequels, sidequels (a story that takes place at the same time as the original, but different perspective)  and spin-offs forever. 

Why make a new story when you can make sequels to ET, Wizard Of Oz and Ben Hur, but all with the original actors - even the dead ones"
Pose,Roger Ebert said this decades ago about CGI.  What was the point of paying actors when you could just create them with computers.
Pose,"I’d take recasts of actors over these deepfakes everyday. 

Alden did an amazing job as Han Solo and I feel so bad he’s getting shafted because of this."
Pose,"How about an AI generated face?
Maybe for the next Star Wars film, the main character is a deepfake ontop of an actors face, and the deepfake is of a fake AI generated face. So the person never existed and can be used in movies forever and will never get old. Performers over the can change, and can come and go, but the face will always be the same."
Pose,Nobody gives a shit about the threat of automation until it steals rich people's jobs.
Pose,"I’m a filmmaker. 27 years in at this point.

My very first “job” “in the business” was as a camera assistant at a symposium for SAG. The topic of the symposium?:

“How Visual Effects poses a threat to performers livelihoods”

This topic is old, and the answer is still the same: the public want somebody to love, somebody to hate, somebody to aspire to be. They want real people.

Performers livelihoods are not at risk."
Pose,I personally hate deepfakes unless they are used as background content. The motion and speech is so off putting and really pulls you out of the scene
Pose,I think they should have just recast Luke in the new Star Wars.
Pose,"Potential? I can easily find a porno of any celebrity worth looking at. 

Easily.

To suggest that deepfakes *aren't* an existential threat to actors/performers is deliberate obfuscation of the reality.

This technology is extremely dangerous."
Pose,"Automation will eventually take almost all of our jobs. One would hope our governments and leaders will have a good plan to prepare for a world with less jobs. If they do, it could be a bright future where people are free to do what they want with their lives without worrying about work.

But they won't and it'll be a disaster, especially for the have nots. Fortunately, that's still quite a while away.

As for deepfakes threatening actors, that's still a ways away too. Current deep fakes aren't good enough imo."
Pose,"Do actors who’s likeness is used for faking paid? Like did mark hamill get paid for this? If not I’d image actor contracts will need to start including this. (If my likeness is used in digital reconstruction, I will need to get paid xx fee) That way they aren’t tied to their character but if there are alterations digitally done they can get paid"
Pose,Oh no! Did somebody’s career become more obsolete because of technology? Only now is it an issue when it affects the upper echelon of our society.
Pose,"""SAG-AFTRA wants to help members maintain control of their likenesses in content, whether that be in a movie, TV series or video game — including after their death.""

Isn't this already the case? Crispin Glover won a lawsuit about this."
Pose,"Oh no, NOW WERE WORRIED!! When rich peoples money is at stake real change happens."
Pose,"Or these characters which require an amalgamation of actors and VFX artist to preform will create more jobs. 

Plus, at the end of the day the tech isn’t really good enough to recreate some one’s likeness to the point of feeling real. The reason one BoBF Luke worked so well (I feel) is because they almost went with the idea of what Luke looks like instead of doing a 1:1 recreation of Mark Hamill. Even then you could still see the seams."
Pose,"Why do we care if actors lose their jobs to deepfake tech? I don’t know about you, but it’s looking like I’m not going to have a whole lot of time for watching movies working 3 jobs just to afford existing."
Pose,Has anyone seen the film “the congress” with Robin Wright? Didn’t think that film would get so much right about the impact of deep fakes.
Pose,Has no one seriously seen The Congress nor read The Futurological Congress?
Pose,"I think what we will see is actors will be able to be chosen for their ability to be expressive with their face, voice and physical acting abilities but who do not match the body shape/size/ethnic characteristics we find attractive will get more work, while those who are good looking but mediocre actors will get less work.  Imagine actors like Danny DeVito or Warwick Davis being able to be cast in leading man roles rather than the niche roles that defined their careers."
Pose,The Congress. Anyone?
Pose,"That's a topic in the movie ""the Congress"" iirc."
Pose,The futurological congress. Watch it
Pose,It’s an issue in which the slippery slope argument actually has traction for the simple fact that the tech will continue to improve such that deep fakes are more available and more convincing. When does it become unethical/when does it lower the value of film as an art form? Tough to say.
Pose,"...wait...Mark Hamill is 70??
Then how old am I now?!"
Pose,The Orville actually made an episode where a krill deep fake was made causing the krill politician to love his political footing… if you haven’t watched the episode I suggest you d
Pose,[deleted]
Pose,This is very dangerous
Pose,So then do actors need to copyright their own performances?
Pose,Since when the fuck has SAG ever done anything for actors besides the top 10% of their earners LMAO
Pose,"I won’t lie, I thought the Luke replication was excellent. I felt like we were seeing the real deal, a Luke we hadn’t seen since the last acts of ROTJ. Personally I’m not sure I see the downside. Only large production companies can afford to do it, and they’ll likely have enough cash to also pay actors they deepfake."
Pose,It’s royalties pay them what they would make if they acted and that’s that. You’re using their likeness and voice just like if it was a rerun.
Pose,Sounds like market forces are going to make actors live like the rest of us. They aren’t gods.
Pose,"If the actor or their estate gets paid - FINE.

If the actor used as stand-in gets paid - FINE

If the FX and CG artists get paid - FINE.

###ALL FINE.

Pay those that should be paid and it’s FINE. 

Stop moaning, ‘actors’ unions."
Pose,Poor actors finding out what the working man has been going thru for the last 60 years. Advancement in technology taking jobs away. I’ll shed a tear.
Pose,Automobiles pose a potential threat to horse breeders' livelihoods
Pose,Performers can afford to make a little less off of a profession in which they make tens of millions
Pose,"Perhaps we can give them new job training... Maybe coding.


Same kind of stuff we did for coal miners, since their livelihood was taken away."
Pose,"Cool. Welcome to being automated along with everyone else who’s been automated since at least the 1800s. But it’s always a surprise.

The former telephone switchboard operators are laughing and laughing and laughing."
Pose,It's great for porn
Pose,I mean you can’t ask Mark Hamil to be younger.
Pose,"Oil lobby: green energy is a threat to our livelihoods.

Learn to code, actors :)"
Pose,Why should I care? There are plenty of other jobs these actors can do. They’re not going to starve. They could always do live plays.
Pose,Boo fucking hoo? Sorry your “job” is replaceable. Guess you’ll have to find a different way to pay for your mansions.
Pose,"I think this can be partially attributed to the younger audience not having lived through the Connery-Moore-Connery-Moore juggling with Bond.  There's an expectation that the same actor plays the same character in the same universe thanks to Marvel's successful run and studios' lack of creativity in coming up with new properties (vs reboots/sequels/prequels).

Luke has to be Hamill in the existing Star Wars universe.  Indiana Jones has to be Harrison Ford in the existing Indiana Jones universe.

We'll see how well received a new Bond is since Craig has been Bond since 2005."
Pose,"Good, get an honest job"
Pose,"But it provides livelihood to dozens more FX artists, editors, modelers, compositors, etc."
Pose,"In 15 years people will be making Hollywood productions from there iPhone 29XPlus, directed by Siri."
Pose,"CG animation was a threat to stop motion animators' livelihoods. 

Digital VFX was a threat to set builders' livelihoods.

Automobiles were a threat to farriers' livelihoods."
Pose,Way more jobs get created with a cgi actor than a real one.
Pose,SAG-AFTRA: We can’t make money off of them if you just steal our stars
Pose,Oh a disgustingly rich class that society obsesses over won’t exist anymore? Fucking good. Fuck them and their fans.
Pose,"Oh no, anyway..."
Pose,Star Wars literally put a dead actor in a movie without his consent. Guess no actor can truly Rest In Peace now. Fuck Rogue One.
Pose,HUGE potential threat.
Pose,Why aren't they complaining about Animation?  Or CGI?  Isn't it basically the same thing?
Pose,"Personally I think this wont bevome as big of deal as people are making it out to be. ny actors wont allow there likeness to be used in this way. Actors & Directors, like any other profession, want to be known for doing things in a way that not only gains them the respect from their peers but also their fans. I can see them looking at this as a way to earn good money for ""cheaper"" work. 



If I had to bet money id say we will likely see it pushed for drama/sitcom style shows on networks like NBC/CBS where production value is low and namenrand is high."
Pose,More like shallowfake. Boom!
Pose,Haha man we’re all like this close to getting replaced by robots with no parachute for those leaving the work force
Pose,Deepfakes are a potential threat to everyone's privacy and should not be allowed without permission from the subject
Pose,Experts are able to find the difference between an authentic photograph and one that has been photoshopped with near perfect accuracy.. What makes this different?
Pose,Who gives a fuck
Pose,"Just don't let companies use their likeness if they wish to make money off of it without consulting them about business first. That's how it usually goes.

Now for people who do deepfakes for fun or satire or porn or any non-commercial projects, just leave them alone. It's not like they're making huge bucks to make a black market out of them. When you see Scarlett Johansson getting it on with that blue guy from Avatar and Snoop Dogg who now looks like a bodybuilder instead of a weed twig, you know it's fake and it was just to satisfy somebody's creative fantasy."
Pose,"Deepfakes are hard to do well. And can be used to augment CG. It sounds like a lot of fretting for nothing.
Edit. Just like the CG actor. People were worried about that but that has not been a real issue"
Pose,Aren’t stuntmen worried that better CGI means they’ll need fewer practical stunts?
Pose,Boo motherfucking hoo. A few actors losing some money is the last of our worries right now.
Pose,Luckily people will most likely use it for pornographic purposes before anything truly sinister
Pose,"For what they do, actors are severely overpayed anyway. New tech is always potentially problematic in some way. We navigate through it. Its fine."
Pose,I've never seen a deepfake that looks legitimate. I'm sorry people over the age of 50 are easily fooled. Maybe they should've spent less time complaining about computers and instead trying to learn how to use one.
Pose,"Computers can’t throw down on real acting, it may work for less emotive rolls though."
Pose,"I thought they already couldn't use the performer's likeness without their permission, e.g. Crispen Glover. I don't see how deep fakes change that."
Pose,"People act as if a group of movie ""stars""' deepfakes wouldn't actually improve their acting."
Pose,Ai is going to ruin writers too
Pose,Shit where will the nepotist elites make their fortunes now?!
Pose,"It's already established that actors control their likeness.

They had to pay Crispin Glover for using a face mold of him in Back to the Future 2.

Michael Biehn got paid more for the use of his image in Alien 3 than he got paid for filming Aliens.

On the original Charmed, the reason why there was never even a photo of Prue after Shannen Doherty left is because they'd have had to pay her."
Pose,Buggy whips anybody???
Pose,That’s not a deepfake.
Pose,Just make it so that scanned assets of an actor and deepfakes can never be combined into a regular work contract and must be separate and that each use of those assets requires a new approval from either the actor or their estate.
Pose,"but you still have someone to perform underneath the deepfake, tho, no? think of it as a mask. You still need someone to put it over, or am I misunderstanding something?"
Pose,But aren't there still performers behind the deepfakes? All this means is that well known actors won't get paid stupidly high amounts of cash to appear in movies. All they'll do is start to license their likeness for use in movies. They won't have to lift a fucking finger or do a single day's work anymore.
Pose,It will be a new era where machines work the jobs no one else wants. Actors will be able to pursue there real passions
Pose,So now deep fakes are ageist/ableist/bodyshaming or whatever? I guess if you live long enough you'll see anything.
Pose,"Oh no, not the performers!"
Pose,We don’t need actors. All movies should be full cgi with minimal voice actors who can do multiple voices.
Pose,"Let’s be real, making sure no one can make a living in a creative field while still getting our favorite “Dance, puppet dance!” Fantasies brought to life is the entire point"
Pose,"AI and machines will be taking away lots of jobs and companies will continue to pollute our earth, let's stop pretending like we actually care about people, it's all about money"
Pose,"Why is this even a thing? Is it really that important that the character looks EXACTLY the same in every movie/show/etc…? I personally don’t mind if it’s not a perfect lookalike because to me, it’s almost like a refreshing take on an old character. It almost feels more like flexing CGI’s muscles than any sort of narrative enhancement."
Pose,Oh gosh oh no
Pose,"And to my mind. It's insane to me to think the Lucas film is too scared of backlash to release a movie, but will recreate arguably the most beloved character with a computer *twice*. 

The first time, it was for a little cameo, and it was still hard to look at. This has been the consensus for all of their prior digi-actors before as well. Well, after their outside hire, he definitely looks better, but it is so wild to me that they decided to give him an extended role in an episode. Every single line delivery was so robotic (duh). There was no personality or emotion. 

And they've since come out and said they would prefer to do that over casting other actors like in Solo? Am I going crazy here?"
Pose,They’ll be fine.
Pose,Maybe you shouldn't have spent the past century advocating for unbridled corporate practices and cutthroat consumerism then? Acting is cute but shouldn't necessarily be a profession. Would rather see a new actor in every movie than Owen Wilson as the next Jesus Christ In the untold bible stories movie septilogy.
Pose,"Ok so,

> “Protection of a performer’s digital self is a critical issue for SAG-AFTRA and our members,” says national executive director Duncan Crabtree-Ireland. “These new technologies offer exciting opportunities but can also pose potential threats to performers’ livelihoods. It is crucial that performers control the exploitation of their digital self, that any use is only with fully informed consent, and that performers are fairly compensated for such use.”

Well so if somebody makes a triple a movie (exit: without their consent) with a performer’s deepfake it’s already a sunk ship.

If the performer agrees I suppose they’d ask for a fiver for the rights or whatever.

I call this bullshit, when Arnold got his deepfake in terminator 11 or whatever it was I’m sure he was given a heads up and some sort of compensation."
Pose,"One of my fav things about deepfakes is the guys who pioneered the technology were asked how they feel about the ramifications of people using deepfakes for evil and they were literally like “that’s not our problem, countermeasures will be made by other people eventually to detect them” lmaooo they did not give a shit at all"
Pose,“We won’t be able to restrict make-believe to the 5 acceptable caucasian actors dominating every mainstream role.” 😭
The Last of the Schmucks,"I don’t really care either way, but it’s really bizarre that Joel and Ellie come across, I think, 0 infected after KC."
The Last of the Schmucks,They didn't need tons of infected just a spattering like when Ellie meets David. I feel like that whole interaction would have been better if there was some infected so it's more of a trusting moment for her like in the game
The Last of the Schmucks,[removed]
The Last of the Schmucks,[removed]
The Last of the Schmucks," I missed Ellie fighting infected with David. It made more sense in the game that he wanted to “partner” with her after seeing how useful she was. In the show it felt like we skipped a beat and his fascination with her felt less earned.

The other action sequence I missed was the fight/escape at the university. It didn’t need to be as big as in the game and Joel could still get stabbed by a bat but I missed the suspense of Joel hobbling out as Ellie has to be the protector for the first time. Felt rushed in the show."
The Last of the Schmucks,They got it backwards. Infected are way more critical to the first story than the second.
The Last of the Schmucks,"I get where they are coming from but I think they overcorrected to the point where you're questioning why a vaccine is needed.

The series is probably 1-2 episodes light."
The Last of the Schmucks,The real issue is it only being 9 episodes. 2 of those episodes were back stories and the rest had to also build up other characters.
The Last of the Schmucks,"I do think there should have been more. The story is of course about the characters, and their relationships... But the infected felt completely shunted to the side in the second half of the story. Joel and Ellie run into, what, 1 after Sam? There are opportunities to make them more influential. You don't have to cut every single action sequence."
The Last of the Schmucks,"It's so weird that people see this argument as binary.

Either ""the story isn't about the infected! it's about J and E and their relationship! more would ruin it!"" or ""there was no infected at all! total lack of action! so boring!""

There's a fucking middle ground, people. They could totally have added *some* more infected without killing the story, without making people bored of the violence. No one is asking for 30 minutes of non-stop infected killing every episode. No one wants TWD again. But yes, a *little* more of infected would have been great, and I look forward to a *little* more of them in season 2."
The Last of the Schmucks,"I definitely think 9 episodes was way too short, and am surprised that they didn’t at least go to say, 12 episodes, to flesh out some of the conflicts and characters. But, maybe that’s all that was greenlit and now they are going to get way more leeway to stretch things out and give some storylines some air. Here’s hoping at least."
The Last of the Schmucks,It did feel like they stripped a little too much from the game
The Last of the Schmucks,Rat King is coming
The Last of the Schmucks,"There were two weird uses of the Infected. 1) that the world wide cordyceps web never came back beyond the episode it was referenced in feels like a miss, and 2) the Tress death kiss is still super weird

Other than that, I don’t think it was over or under done. There was a whole scene where the earth opened and a Belcher showed up"
The Last of the Schmucks,Translation: “The Last of Us” will have a shitload more money in the budget for effects.
The Last of the Schmucks,Balance fixes for next patch. Nice!
The Last of the Schmucks,Epic series. They need to turn it into a video game.
The Last of the Schmucks,"It was a serious flaw for me. The story starts on top of a serious,cataclysmic threat and sticks to it for 2 episodes. We see infected again once after that. It's a great story but they travel around freely never having to deal with infected again. Ellie's importance fades. I watched the middle episodes thinking ""oh shit!! they're going to have to enter the buildings"" but no infected anywhere. They have to use the tunnels, no infected, they travel through forests, no infected. They travel to a university then to an empty town and enter a home with no infected anywhere again. The last batch of episodes I basically told myself the infected aren't a danger I guess. I dont see it as a necessity to have the story we got. It's still top tier TV but the show kinda shifts into a generic post apocalypse rather than the world it started off as. Games need high numbers of encounters to keep engagement but this goes hard the opposite direction."
The Last of the Schmucks,"Its weird. The show has really driven home to me how little the infected actually have to do with the plot, but still their absence makes them feel like less a part of traversing the world. I didn’t mind them not being around much, I expected it, but it almost seems backwards to commit to more of them in season 2 by when there’ll be Scars and the WLF to represent now as well."
The Last of the Schmucks,"For me, without infected the relationship between Joel and Ellie fell a little flat because their bond felt somewhat unearned. In the game they are pushed to the limits and that experience makes their bond so much stronger. So maybe an episode or two were missing with more action between them and infected."
The Last of the Schmucks,It's a good show but it just feels like blander more watered down version of the game. The show is just missing that constant tension and feeling that anything could happen at any time.
The Last of the Schmucks,"The show is probably one of the greatest game adaptations ever. It's amazing how similar they kept a lot of set pieces and dialog. Amazing work.

However, as a show, it's really not that compelling and very boring. You miss out on a lot of key moments and growth between characters because the story moves at a quick pace. The episode where Ellie meets David would have been much better if they included them fighting the infected together. Stuff like that is missing greatly."
The Last of the Schmucks,They are blazing through the story and skipping all the big action sequences.
The Last of the Schmucks,"I mostly enjoyed the show but I would say pacing and choosing which storylines to focus on more, was the biggest issue of season 1. Also the finale was a bit short and disappointing, ngl"
The Last of the Schmucks,"This show has been so strange to me! I loved Last of Us the game... and I love the show... but it feels like they should have had 3 more episodes. The story beats were there but it felt kind of forced, the father/daughter relationship between Joel and Ellie. Like we didn't get enough time with them to develop that relationship in the show with all the side stories (episode 3 is an absolute masterpiece in storytelling). I haven't watched the final episode yet but I dunno... 12 episodes would have been great."
The Last of the Schmucks,[removed]
The Last of the Schmucks,The lack of action started in episode 3
The Last of the Schmucks,The monkey paw curls and turns S2 into one of the Resident Evil movies.
The Last of the Schmucks,When I hear a great show is making changes to address fans' concerns I just assume it's about to get significantly worse and so far I've been right every time
The Last of the Schmucks,"How will all the defenders constantly screaming ""its not about infected! Duh!"" be able to say that after every episode now?!"
The Last of the Schmucks,With how little the infected were shown I almost forgot they existed.
The Last of the Schmucks,"Too late, you already skipped all the good stuff"
The Last of the Schmucks,Season 1 treated the game as if it were a walking simulator. It was such a bizarre choice.
The Last of the Schmucks,"Yeah i got bored tbh it was like- Meet new characters, they die. Repeat. 🤣"
The Last of the Schmucks,My wife and I just watched ep 6 and she said she didn't like the last 2 episodes cause they have almost no action. This is a woman that closes heir eyes in every gore scene on any movie/show.
The Last of the Schmucks,"It felt like an adventure of the week buddy cop show. It was fun to look into this world a little more, but as far as overarching risk within the plot it really didn’t feel like there was any…"
The Last of the Schmucks,"I really did not like the infected in the finale, it highlights the problem they are trying to avoid

Because of the needs of the scene, the infected just runs up and kind of pins the person and makes noises in front of them while suspense builds

After the suspense is allowed to build for a little bit, the person somehow manages to get the thing off of them.  Usually they manage to reach a nearby weapon.

Then, even though the infected just did it's whole ""pin them and make scary noises"" routine, somehow a bite mark appears on the person's leg.  Darn, now they are infected.

/yawn"
The Last of the Schmucks,The show felt incredibly hollow to me.
The Last of the Schmucks,"I liked the Bill and Frank episode, and the explanations for the origin of of cordyceps and Ellie's immunity. But overall the show just wasn't as good as the game. I think it needed more time maybe idk. I wasn't quite buying the relationship, especially at the end."
The Last of the Schmucks,Oh something tells me they're will be something else that will be complained about in S2
The Last of the Schmucks,"I'm two minds about it.

At first I was really enjoying the fact that the zombie apocalypse in LOU was just the setting, just the catalyst for human stories. I'm not big fan of body horror and gruesome death, like you see all the time in Walking Dead. Walking Dead also seems to ask the question ""how can we have the protagonists fight more zombies?"" while LOU asks ""what adventures could the protagonists experience in a zombie-ridden world"".

What also made me double-down on this opinion were the zombie episodes of this show - the second episode and the second Kansas episode. The zombie portions were really clichéd and gamey. Seriously, in the second episode, once they entered the building you could re-construct the following story from zombie clichés. Zombies hiding in a seemingly empty building? Check. Building falling apart exactly when the protagonists enter the building? Check. Debris falling right behind the protagonists, blocking their way back? Check. Zombies resistant to bullets? Check. Hasty, nervous reloading? Check. Protagonist trying to be silent and stepping on something loud? Check. One of the protagonists getting bitten but hiding this fact? Check... And the the body horror / zombie kiss that was made just to shock the audience...

And the zombie portion of the second Kansas episode was kinda short to be full of clichés, but it felt like a video game. A boss fight while Joel is suddenly a perfect sniper (after missing the truck several times a few minutes earlier)? C'mon, that was outright lazy. All in all, I find the zombie bits of the show to be the worse parts (with the exception of the mall episode, which was really boring and dragged-out).

But that being said, the show sometimes goes too far and forgets about the zombies completely. I don't want more zombie fights (especially given how sub-par this show handles them), but I want more reminders that this is a zombie apocalypse. We have had many sight of ruined, destroyed and desolate world... but almost every time without zombies. As a big Fallout fan my default impression from these sights and stories is that it's an aftermath of some war. Why couldn't they show some zombies walking around there?

Big offenders in this regard were the 8th and 6th episodes. Both were completely lacking any zombies and 8th episode didn't even mention them. Don't get me wrong, both were probable the best episodes in this show, but they could have been part of ANY post-apocalyptic show. Seriously, in episode 8 I completely forgot about the zombies until Ellie started screaming ""I'm infected"" in the climax... and I remembered that zombies are actually a thing in this universe. In was kinda jarring.

That is probably mi biggest criticism of the show. It has some great production value, great stories and great characters... but it doesn't build the world particularly well and the main narrative is disjointed. Like, twice in 9 episodes we jumped to a flashback for 90% of the episode. First flashback was a great story, but did nothing for the overarching narrative. The second flashback served to enhance Ellie's backstory... but it was boring as hell. And the whole narrative and the worldbuilding seems to be undecisive about how important and threatening are the zombies."
The Last of the Schmucks,Im not sure those that havent played the game will be ready for the season two though. It will be quite a big departure from season one. Im more interested whether they will announce TLOU3 soon after this as the source material had finished.
The Last of the Schmucks,"It’s not lack of action, just lack of actual zombies. The show is good, it got me hooked. But there is a lack of zombies."
The Last of the Schmucks,Hopefully it does. I loved both games and the show but the lack of infected was just a bad idea. They are the *reason* the world is in the state it's in. There didn't need to be walking dead level of monsters but God damn there needed to be alot more than we got
The Last of the Schmucks,"Honestly, i thought they sprinkled in action well enough. I really don’t care for excessive gun shots and screaming. Would’ve likes the bloater to be more of a problem than it was.

Hopefully they do the Rat King well."
The Last of the Schmucks,Is anyone gonna care about infected when we get round 2 of everyone being pissed off by *you know what*?
The Last of the Schmucks,I don’t know maybe it’s because I  didn’t play the video games but I didn’t have a lot of the issues that people in this thread have 🤷🏾‍♂️. Are there parts I thought could have been done better? Certainly but I could say that about any show that I’ve watched. I don’t think this is #1 greatest show of all time or anything like that but that’s a huge weight to put on any show especially one in its first season. Right now I think it’s pretty great with potential to get better adaption purists be damned.
The Last of the Schmucks,"The truth is episode 3 needed to be cut and that 1 hr 20 mins of time desperately was needed in other places, including Joel and Ellie having more encounters with infected.

Episode 3 is great tv don’t get me wrong it’s just very irrelevant to the story being told which becomes a problem when we run out of episodes telling that story"
The Last of the Schmucks,"I'm sitting here shouting to them not to listen to the criticism like Cooper in the tesseract in Interstellar.

I worry they'll over-correct. 

In the show, these things are so damn dangerous that if they show fights with them more than a few times a season, it will quickly feel like TWD where there are no stakes whatsoever and the zombies can be dispatched with such ease that you wonder why society ever fell. 

So I'd rather have too few than too many. Personally."
The Last of the Schmucks,"I, for one, have thoroughly enjoyed the overarching threat of infected with a lack of their constant appearance. The same goes for the need to show gore. How they showed Ellie >!killing David!<…Hitchcock would’ve been proud."
The Last of the Schmucks,[deleted]
The Last of the Schmucks,"When the whole hubbub came out of episode 3, as one of ""the greatest episode in television history"", in the grand scheme for overall series progression and impact to the story of Ellie and Joel, in my opinion it was a wasted episode that could have been dedicated to more infected action, tension, or mcguffin chasing."
The Last of the Schmucks,The real monsters were the uninfected.
The Last of the Schmucks,"Not what I expected going in. Not my thing, I expected way more action. I’m assuming most people who liked it didn’t play the game."
The Last of the Schmucks,"I believe no spores and lack of infected hugely decreased the gravity of the situation. 

We see pockets of people living in gated communities and surviving. They die of starvation, lack of medicine, raids etc. rather than the infected. So why would we need a vaccine? Just don't venture to deep or beyond.

I mean it doesn't have to be action scenes. Seeing infected and changing their road, seeing other people getting killed could have been enough ro remind us what's at stake."
The Last of the Schmucks,"That’s super disappointing fr.  The show is so awesome bc it is the story of the people in this crazy situation, less to do with the situation itself.  Making it all about the infected seems like it’ll ruin why the show is so great"
The Last of the Schmucks,Who’s complaining about the lovely personal stories?
The Last of the Schmucks,My biggest complaint is pacing. In the game we spent so much extra time traveling and having personal moments along with some serious action beats. Felt like it needed 1 or 2 extra episode of peril / personal moments in there. Hell the college piece in the game was such a big part of the story in the game and yet in the show Joel just gets stabbed and that’s it.
The Last of the Schmucks,"I don’t want “a lot more infected” I just want enough to make them feel like a threat, to remind the audience why the world fell apart. Obviously you cannot recreate gameplay where your character is an all powerful god compared to everyone around them, where Joel kills dozens of infected at a time in a TV show, but there needed to be more threat…weather it was action packed with a few infected or stealthily getting past a bunch, they should have been there

Edit: This isn’t to say I didn’t love the show, it’s an amazing adaptation, but it’s fair to criticize things we love and want better even if it is good!"
The Last of the Schmucks,Naw fam they fucked up the finale. I won't be back. Walking Dead it is...
The Last of the Schmucks,"I'm cool with the amount of infected in the first season, but it wouldn't have hurt to sprinkle more in here and there.  They're there to keep you busy as you go from location to location in the game.  They're there to pad the length of the game... and I don't mean that in a bad way, it's just that it's usually the point of a video game and people want 10+ hours of it for their money, so you have to devise an excuse to have that much gameplay through plot.  This is a TV show and there is no gameplay.  I'd have liked to see *something* out there in all of those rural areas they go through.  Maybe not big fights but there's really no random infected just walking around out there?  Episode 3 shows a glimpse of a random loner infected that walks into one of Bill's traps, and the one buried under rubble, but that idea isn't really visited again and it's like they don't exist at all outside of cities."
The Last of the Schmucks,"It definitely felt a bit too fast paced. Other shows drag on and barely move each episode while here we have one that moves a bit too fast. I still really enjoyed it though and looking forward to season 2.

Also the game coming out on PC, I've never played the game. Looking forward to experiencing it all."
The Last of the Schmucks,"I’m happy with the lack only because I really like what they are doing with the rest of the story and killing zombies has been done to fucking death.

Also it allows my wife to watch most of it with me which is nice."
The Last of the Schmucks,I gave up watching this BORING zombie show without zombies……..
The Last of the Schmucks,Please don't do the same thing the walking dead did. Where the zombies took a backseat because they want to show that other humans are the real monsters
The Last of the Schmucks,...now that the initial hype is gone ...
The Last of the Schmucks,"The show did something the game failed miserably at, i dont even care if joel dies."
The Last of the Schmucks,The hype on this show is odd because it's no different to others of this genre. It's the same characters over and over
The Last of the Schmucks,"I’m glad it didn’t do like the Walking Dead did which was put in zombie kills for the sake of the Talking Dead’s bit after the show.  

There’s plenty of time for it.  And do it with style and substance.  Not belligerently."
The Last of the Schmucks,"This makes me sad because that's what audiences did to The Walking Dead, complained about everything until they had to put a huge zombie fight into every episode until it got so repetitive the story fell apart.  This show ISN'T ABOUT THE INFECTED!  Shows like this never are.  It's about Joel and Ellie's relationship."
The Last of the Schmucks,It was like war. Mostly boredom followed by terror for a few minutes.
The Last of the Schmucks,I look forward to the complaints that there’s too much action
The Last of the Schmucks,"Why does this sound like it’s gonna turn into Aliens? 

Ellie: We'd better get back 'cause it'll be dark soon and they mostly come at night. Mostly."
The Last of the Schmucks,We gonna get the rat king.
The Last of the Schmucks,"Frankly, the fact that it wasn’t just another zombie show was one of the best things about it."
The Last of the Schmucks,Lack of action made it good. Dont sell out to overmedicated producers!
The Last of the Schmucks,Finally some less circle jerky takes than the main sub.
The Last of the Schmucks,"I don't even think the show needed any more action at all particularly.

But it is weird we only saw clickers what...2 or 3 times? 

That's literally my only gripe, I didn't think the pacing was poor or anything. Didn't even need an action sequence, but just some reminder that they exist."
The Last of the Schmucks,"I was expecting one more big infected scene somewhere toward the end of the season, but the more I think about it the harder time I have pinpointing where it could have gone that would have been believable and moved the plot forward. Somewhere mid season I started to think we'd see one in episode 7 with Riley, but when I watched it I realized it would not have been believable for Ellie to survive a full on hoard even with Riley and some pipe bombs. Plus it emphasizes just how intense the threat is that they could barely take down one together and they still both got bit. I think the only place it might have worked would be to have kept the sequence with David in, but then I question the plausibility of that group he's amassed being that large and surviving in the area when they are largely women and children and so hungry that they are eating their own dead. Plus, if it's a small encounter it is basically repeating the same relationship building experience of the museum encounter with Joel. Probably could have worked but it wouldn't have been big enough to meet the bar for emphasizing the larger threat and I don't know how much it would have added."
The Last of the Schmucks,"I preferred the lack of ""zombies."" It makes this series about the humans and not just another Walking Dead."
The Last of the Schmucks,"I think they missed the perfect middle ground that a 10 episode season would have given. Personally, stretching out the university scene would have made the rest of the show that much more impactful ie. having Joel still interact and kill the man from David's group and still having him get stabbed, then having Ellie fight through the horde with an injured Joel.

Also, the infected fight with Ellie and David I believe would have greatly solidified not only the viewer's initial trust in David, but also would help ""earn"" a reason for David to take such a liking to Ellie. The rest could have been the same. 

I am beyond excited that we even got a show this fucking good based on a game I know we all love, but there is undoubtably quite a bit of missed opportunity with a few rushed scenarios."
The Last of the Schmucks,"Some stalkers in an office building with the lights off would have been cool, we’ll probably see some in the next season."
The Last of the Schmucks,Personally I find the zombie stuff to be the least compelling part of the show.  I think it got the the appropriate amount of story time.  Endless zombie battles are mind numbingly dull.
The Last of the Schmucks,[removed]
The Last of the Schmucks,[removed]
The Last of the Schmucks,"I feel like the lack of infected was warranted IMO. Other than the opening scene, the whole thing takes place 20 years after the initial outbreak. Humanity has learned to adapt and deal with the infected. It would almost take me out of it to see humanity still having to CONSTANTLY fight off waves of zombies 20 years later. That makes sense from a game play perspective but not so much from a narrative one. On top of that, the whole point of the show is to show how shitty people have become as a result of all of this. The show that people want with lots of infected and fighting the infected would need to take place in the months after the initial outbreak, not 20 years later. I think the show made a lot of good decisions in their direction."
The Last of the Schmucks,"My only major complaint about season 1 is the lack of infected. They got so many iconic moments spot on, but cut so many iconic infected scenes. So I'm happy to hear that this will change moving forward. 

I get it, they don't want to just throw in action for the sake of action, but I wonder if they went too far the other way to try and create distance from the label of being a game story."
The Last of the Schmucks,A lot more… considering we have been seeing zero infected in the last episodes.. 1 infected is way more.
The Last of the Schmucks,Yeah like the impression I got was that infected quite literally don’t exist in the cold or outside of cities. So why doesn’t everyone just fuck off to the woods then? Made the hard push for the cure seem a bit pointless.
The Last of the Schmucks,"Meh, I have had my fill with actual zombies over the past 10 years of our noses being rubbed in them. I want a compelling story - which we 100% got with the first season here. Incredible show!"
The Last of the Schmucks,"Yeah I can see why they had to shorten the season.

There were only 3 or 4 memorable episodes at the most.

It was a great effort, but not a series I'd watch again."
The Last of the Schmucks,"People will always complain. There was zombie action when there needed to be, and they told a perfect story. It's one of the best adaptations I've ever seen. There are plenty of shows and movies out there if you need your gratuitous zombie violence fix that don't have the depth of this show"
The Last of the Schmucks,Part of what is so enjoyable is the episodes where you almost forget there are infected. Getting so involved in the characters arc and then being reminded “oh yeah the worlds over run by fast mushroom zombies” is what made it work in my opinion.
The Last of the Schmucks,"Coming from someone who did not play the games, I didn’t mind the lack of infected. I think a major theme of the show for me was that humanity were the true monsters, and focusing on those human elements was awesome."
The Last of the Schmucks,"Only real complaint I have is for all the shows that exist with 20+ episodes per season, is that this easily could have been at least 11 episodes. Loved it regardless, just wish it lasted a little longer. 3, 5, 8 and I stand by it. Great adaptation. Can’t wait for season 2 & 3 playing Part 2 on PS5 3rd time right meow"
The Last of the Schmucks, It was the most boring season of television that I had been looking forward to. Show sucks so much. Just kill all the characters already I don’t care.
The Last of the Schmucks,"Lol… I mean, the zombies were literally the only interesting part of the show, the ONLY new concept to an otherwise extremely generic plot and… they just sort of neutered them. 

Frankly the damage is done. I don’t care about season 2. This show was like every single other apocalypse dystopia movie ever. I was getting deja vu. Throwing some zombies into an otherwise boring, repetitive, and depressing plot is not going to fix anything in season 2. Just another “people are the real monsters” story trying to pretend it’s deep

People have said this game has like, one of the best stories in gaming history… umm… glad I never played it since that was obviously a lie"
The Last of the Schmucks,"I found the makeup for the infected to be very unconvincing and not particularly scary. In the few scenes of infected, especially the one where Ellie stabs the infected in the basement, it just looked like some dude in crappy makeup. I'm glad there was so few infected in the first season. I also don't know why they are promising more infected for season 2 when the second in the series of video games was much less about infected."
The Last of the Schmucks,And more golfing
The Last of the Schmucks,I’m just saying. The walking dead used infected as a crutch during the boring shit and this show didn’t have that issue.
Romance is a bonus book,I don’t care unless it butts up against accuracy in something that purports to be accurate.
Romance is a bonus book,"I agree with most points here. I also feel like, instead of plug and playing minorities into white stories, can I see some actual black history? Some African romance? I feel like casting minorities into white history isn't very inclusive, as it just reinforces the idea that the only stories that matter are the white ones. There just has to be a rich cultural history of storytelling from black motherlands that we are being denied."
Romance is a bonus book,"it really depends on the type of show and whether it's a modern take on the period or something attempting to be a realistic approach. you mostly see this in comedy/drama period shows and not something like downtown abbey with a more serious tone.

i haven't seen any of these shows but bridgerton, dickinson and the great are the kind of shows that are period but .. not, and use that to their benefit to tell a story however they want. it works inside that creative bubble. i just don't want to see unrealistic casting in a show aiming to be accurate to the time and set in a tightly controlled historical narrative as it's incredible distracting in the same way a ferrari pulling a carriage instead of a horse would be.

there are so many non-white historical figures all over the world who would benefit from having a show about them that displays a larger diverse cast set somewhere that isn't england/europe. you could even just make someone up and have them be your lead and show off whatever cultures you want. i don't think it's progressive to race swap characters or insert them in unrealistic roles when someone simply needs to invest in a production centered around a figure/character that is already non-white. i can't make hollywood create this show so we're all relying on someone to see the potential in a show like this which begs the question why it hasn't happened yet/to a noticeable level. i don't think it's a lack of audience if there truly are a large number of progressive people in the world. feels like a hollywood problem."
Romance is a bonus book,"The costumes of Bridgerton include details and styles from different centuries so I always assumed the show was meant to be a bit surreal, not quite on the same linear timeline as real life.

Romance is a bonus book,"I think if it’s an alternative history, it’s absolutely fine. Like in For All Mankind having women essentially running space programs. It’s nice to think that had things gone differently, Britain wouldn’t have had such a sketchy/racist past and might have actually seen a benefit in different cultures from Africa or Asia. 

But if it’s based on a book, or an actual historical event, it’s pretty pathetic to “amend” things. It’s suggesting they know better than the original writer or you know, history. 

Like that Oliver Twist Prequel, “Dodger” from the BBC. There were very few ethnic minority people in the UK before WW2. We had emancipated slaves, known as “the black poor” (around 20,000), but substantially less Asian and south Asian people until the post WW2 migration.

And yet, they felt it necessary to take the work of Charles Dickens, whose book, Oliver Twist was written about the white poor in London. 

I also think it makes a mockery of the plight of those early migrants to the UK who had to deal with the worst kind of racism, or the slaves who were set free, but worked for their former masters on absolute pittance and lived in squalor.

These stories, the history, needs to be kept as it was written so as to ensure people don’t forget how we got to where we are. When you forget your past, you can’t learn for the future."

Maybe black actors and actresses just wanna wear clothes with ruffles and sip tea while affecting posh accents for a change.

Romance is a bonus book,"If you’re going for historical accuracy, “colorblind casting” or rather “intentionally casting BIPOC” blunts the reality of racism and colonialism. Even if it’s in the subtext of a show like Bridgerton, you don’t have the Regency Era in Britain without the brutality of the British Empire exploiting countries full of non-white people. 

Unfortunately, history is too muddy to whitewash racism out of the picture by hiring BIPOC actors to play people who could only have been white in their time and place."
Romance is a bonus book,"Lol keeping an eye on this thread.

For me, it's one of those things that usually don't notice, but if a production team is prioritizing diversity, or whatever cause, it can get in the way of the end product. I don't think anyone will disagree that a good chunk of shows that go down this road end up shit. 

Plus every time I do notice a period piece that's heavily diverse I think about the freak out if we had random races in a period piece that wasn't European. 

Like if the Woman King had a random white person in the African tribe lmao. 

It's a cultural growing pain from becoming less discriminatory that we'll hopefully grow out of."

Romance is a bonus book,"It’s never “color-blind”, it’s always about making a conscious statement. Whether the statement works mainly depends on whether the production in question is hurt or helped by deliberately flouting realism and cultural specificity. 

The bigger, more irritating problem is that networks tripping over themselves to declare their support for “diversity” and “multiculturalism” still end up recycling the same Eurocentric narratives anyway, but now just pretending that European history is something it wasn’t (racially diverse societies reflecting modern liberal values). Ironically that’s actually pretty regressive! It’s just allowing modern liberal audiences to feel guilt-free nostalgia for periods in history where inequality and persecution, particularly directed by those in the ruling classes (who are often the main characters in these productions being “diversified”… hmmm) were brutal facts of life.

This irritates the shit out of me in the new *GoT* spinoff: a member of a notoriously inbred, racist noble family is randomly black now, the promotional material seems to heavily emphasize the “YASS QUEEN SLAY” pseudo-feminist angle of the story, and the producers have assured audiences they won’t include the sexual violence present in the source material. The cumulative message here is that they want to coddle the sensibilities of modern social media-using liberal audiences in this story about an oppressive monarchy, the point of which is *supposed to be* that European nobility are not your friends and not good people! Fucking moronic imo"
Romance is a bonus book,"I don't think it's delusional if things aren't pretending to be period true, but it's not really progressive either.

Romance is a bonus book,"What people don't get about Bridgerton is that it's a fantasy. Not a period piece. ""Love"" is literally magic in this universe. And there is no word for 'magic'. It makes all kinds of wild improbable unrealistic shit happen in the show like causing it to rain when people kiss. It is quite literally at the center of all politics, conversation, philosophy, fighting, and despair. That's why the race thing doesn't need to make historical sense. It's a whole different world, with different physics, and a different timeline. It's really quite a good show when you view it like this because it's no longer a 'turn your brain off' type deal. It makes you think about how well it completely blends genres in a way that I'm not sure the producers are doing on purpose."
Romance is a bonus book,"I watched the film “Mary Queen of Scots” in an airplane, and I wasn’t aware about the movies casting prior to watching it. It’s a historical movie, so at first, I was really confused with a Duke played by a black actor and all the other non-white cast. If there was black duke in 17th century England, it would be a HUGE F-ing deal given that England enslaved black people. There are reasons why no English duke has ever been black, and I feel like this type of casting is an attempt to hide the very real prejudice and racism that’s happened historically. It’s like casting jews to play Nazi characters, which would confuse the fact that Nazis were racist towards jews. 
I don’t mind it if the movie or show is not based in history, or with musicals and theater pieces. But if it deals with historical characters, then it’s just confusing."

Romance is a bonus book,The same people who scream the loudest about “cultural appropriation” have no problem blackwashing European history.
Romance is a bonus book,"I think it's generally just hamfisted to score points. Let's look at Vikings: Valhalla. This show (and it's precursor) was never historically accurate whatsover, just stylizing myth etc. However,  a perfect example of this. Our setting: Norway (Kattegat, whatever) 950-1000 A.D. We follow the story of Jarl Haakon, a...black woman? \*record stop\* Wait, what? This just makes no sense and no amount of talk can make it so. The director just spits out platitudes and bad reads of history to justify it because he knows he can't in reality. After getting questioned about it, he states that it's just purely fictional, just happens to be named after a historical figure? Yeah, okay.

Then you have shows like Netflix's The Witcher. This is one of these situations where it is less egregious (because it's fantasy fiction) but doesn't make sense from the source material. We have another setting in medieval Scandinavia....

**Novels/Video game:** Our story takes place in the Northern Kingdoms. Like medieval Scandinavia, it's not an area really known for its cultural and ethnic diversity, it's a hyper dogmatic, and xenophobic culture, and most denizens are of the same ethnicity, most non-human races purged out. Opposed to the Northern Kingdoms we have the Nilfgaardian Empire, an area that's well known for being more ethnically and (actually) racially diverse. You can't say culturally really because Nilfgaard did sort of push adopting their culture or ""pounding sand."" No one is good, everyone is morally grey at best.

**Show:**  \*que happy music\* ""\*\*WELCOME TO THE NORTHERN KINGDOMS, ALL ARE WELCOME HERE!!!!! Look at all our diversity, we may not be perfect but at least our named characters have a good diversity ratio, we are for sure the good guys here!  Oh no, here comes those nasty Nilfgaard folks, coming to take our FREEDOM, they are so bad, and SO NON DIVERSE"".....See the problem here?

The perceived villains of the series, Nilfgaard (although you could say they were actually the better faction morally, comparatively) are the EXACT opposite of what they present in the source material. More akin to WW2 Germany than the Roman Empire they more closely resemble in the books. The Northern Kingdoms while not perfect have diversity in all of the leadership areas, and are freedom fighters, going against the tyranny of the south in the show, while they are just rotten, genocidal, and dogmatic to the extreme in the source material. This quest for ""the message,"" leads to bad story writing, and subverting source material.

TL:DR: Outside of a few examples, it messes with immersion and breaks source material / history that the narrative is based on.

Edit: I realize these aren't romance shows, but it's the same overarching issue."

Romance is a bonus book,"I mean sometimes people don’t want to think of how horrible history actually is. And it gives an opportunity for minority actors to play roles in a period piece that they otherwise would not be able to be cast in. 

So yeah, I get it. It’s a lie. But also sometimes people just want to see themselves (or people that look like them) on the screen in a romance novel type situation. 

As long as period dramas still get made telling the real and awful history, it’s okay for Bridgerton to exist as well.

Anyhoo, read the article, it makes some good points. But it ignores some obvious things too."
Romance is a bonus book,"Depends, really. If it's supposed to be period-accurate, then yes, casting colorblind roles is delusional - ***especially*** when so many untold stories of historical POCs already exist.

I’m also tired of white producers telling white stories just with “a black one.” At least flesh out the POC and do some basic research.

I still cringe at the show about Anne Boleyn having a black woman play her. It has the reverse effect those who do the casting think it’s going to have."

Romance is a bonus book,"I just find it funny that both racists and woke people think only people who are the same ethnicity as the character they're portraying is OK, and they're both wrong for totally different reasons. If characters are a specific race in fiction and it's pivotal to the plot; or wouldn't ring true for them to be other races based on the conext, that's ok. If they're not then cast whoever. It doesn't have to be complicated.

An example: Dark Tower should not have cast Idris Elba as Roland because a central part of character interactions later in the book has a character not trusting Roland because he's white, and now that whole massive plot point makes no sense. Its not ""that the original character was white"" that mattered, its that the original character being white had plot significance."

Romance is a bonus book,"I agree that it depends on the tone of the show and if race matters to the story. Downton Abbey was cited by 1 commenter where it would be important. There is a big emphasis on the ""upstairs / downstairs"" aspect of life back then. Race would have been a factor so I think it would be important in that show to stay truer to historical accuracy... 

But if we are talking about something like the Bridgerton romcom then it doesn't matter. Nothing in that show is accurate from the style of dress to many of their social interactions. Race isn't a factor in that show so it doesn't matter. So if you want to complain about accuracy then let's just rip the entire show apart. 

I do think there is more than just ""historical accuracy"" at play for many who are opposed because there are people who get upset if fictional species are not white (fairies, elves, etc) - which have nothing to do with accurate depictions... And other who get upset if characters are changed from men to women even if it doesn't affect the story...

For those ""worried"" that kids would get ""confused"" to be told there were *no* POC who were nobles etc...Don't worry!! There were!!! It was just a much smaller number than you see in these shows. There was even an English queen who was rumored to be a POC who the character in Bridgerton is based off of (Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz)"
Romance is a bonus book,"The issue is you are limiting the roles that PoC if you stick to ""it has to be realistic/the way the author intended"" all the time.

Take Shakespeare.  There are only maybe a handful of roles by PoC in all of his works. So should PoC not be allowed to play Romeo? Or Hamlet? And we see this all the time in other works. Look at Jane Austen. How many times has her work been produced in films, tv, plays, etc? Should all those roles only go to white men and women? 

And I know people like to say ""well that means Black Panther can be a white man! You are being hypocritical if Romeo can be black but Black Panther can't be white!"" 

Okay. So I'm a hypocrite. I'd be a hypocrite and be happy with it. There are over 12 white superhero actors in the MCU. There are maybe 2 black heroes, only one of them has (had, shit Chadwick Boseman's death still friggen sucks) his own solo movie. I'll be willing to be labeled a hypocrite if it means the one black MCU hero stays black."

Even films and tv shows that are based on historical events and/or books based on them make historical accuracy secondary.

I watched abt 15 minutes of Bridgerton. That was 14 more than I should have. I simply didn’t like it. Not my cup of tea but it’s obvious that it is a dramatic fairy tale form of escapism for the YA crowd. Not surprising since that is the reason I don’t like most shows like this.

They're just cast as white people where 15 years ago they would've cast a white person."
Romance is a bonus book,As a MexAm I’ve always changing the race did a disservice to the content and the race. I’ve always admired Coming to America blend of real life America with Imagined African Royalty. A Black Honeymooners isn’t as good as a Black Jefferson Movin On Up. Living Single is not a Black Friend’s. Is a Black Annie a new Annie like The Wiz is a new Wizard of Oz. All I’m saying is use your imagination and reimagine a country where that conduct and story is possible
Romance is a bonus book,"I personally love colour blind casting, but we need to stop telling people who don't that it's some minor change that makes no difference."
Romance is a bonus book,"It would be appalling if it weren't for all those whitewashed movies and shows, and you know, Jesus. It's all good, some balance needs to be restored lol"
Romance is a bonus book,"I've always thought of the problem being a lack of representation.

Tell me the story of the servants as the only non white people in the palace, rather than just focusing on the princess.
Make the princess as white as she was, and show her warts and all, including her respect or lack thereof for the servant.

Putting the crown on someone who could only have been the servant in the setting is false representation and an injustice to the real people who could only climb so high as there race or creed or gender would allow them.

Just my 2 cents."
Romance is a bonus book,"Hot waters, but I kind of like historical accuracy."
Romance is a bonus book,In a weird way it seems like it would kind of be rewriting history to me. Let’s be honest more people are watching tv/movies than studying history. Could give them false ideas of what history was really like
Romance is a bonus book,This argument is so stupid in shows like Bridgerton where they in no way are claiming any historical accuracy who cares. I can see it in shows trying to be historically accurate “in the lens of race”. And arguing Hollywood is responsible for showing that accuracy is insane. Anyone with a competent 8th grade education can see this wasn’t the way things were and it’s your history teachers job to explain that to you not Hollywood
Romance is a bonus book,"What gets me is when people don't complain about other shit being inaccurate. Everyone would have fucked up teeth probably bad gout and frequent diarrhea from poor water sources.  Everything is well lit even when there was no electricity. 

Yes here is a black guy walking around let's pick on that rather than this well manicured road we are walking on"
Examination of Conscience,"""our North American idea of the hero""

On TV. They only represent what's on TV.

""as a North American audience, have favored""

It's what the audience has been given, not necessarily what they favored."

Examination of Conscience,"Really loving Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Kyle Chandler working together in Super Pumped. It's also cool to hear Quentin Tarantino narrative the show, and that his girl Uma just showed up in the show."
Examination of Conscience,"I really like Super Pumped, JGL plays the ultimate tech douche. The scene where Larry Page basically insults him to his face and he has zero self awareness to recognize it. Just this slow build up to self-destruction"
Examination of Conscience,"I like The Dropout, but couldn't get into the other ones."
Examination of Conscience,"Narrator: ""They didn't learn."""
Examination of Conscience,">The shows might invite critiques of the new economy, but they are also a reminder of how inescapable it is, and how much we've come to accept the fraud as a price we pay for that economy's benefits.

Have we accepted fraud? Didn't Holmes just get convicted? Aren't all these stories about people who were fired from the very companies they founded?

Is the system really that broken? These startups are funded with private money rather than public money, so the taxpayer is off the hook. Some companies fail, others succeed. Investors win, investors lose. Uber has changed city-living for the better and forced local governments to adjust taxi policies. WeWork tried and didn't quite succeed at their goal, but shouldn't we celebrate people that try to shake things up? Sure, tech is filled with blowhards and assholes and snakes... but how's that different than any other institution?

Is the tech scene any better over in Europe or Asia?"
Examination of Conscience,[deleted]
Examination of Conscience,"I really could not care less about rich people losing money.  They still end up with a ridiculous amount, even after the ""downfall.""

So why should I care?"
Examination of Conscience,Who are some current figures in 2022 like Adam Neumann or Elizabeth Holmes? Is there a podcast or website that covers this stuff in real time?
Examination of Conscience,Amanda Seyfried really captures Elizabeth Holmes weird energy. And she nailed the fake deep voice!
Examination of Conscience,"You should check out ""The Inventor"" from HBO, it's a more true to facts documentary.  The Dropout takes a lot of dramatic license with the story."
Examination of Conscience,"I’ve seen all three and definitely think The Dropout is the best of them. I think the story is just better and more “wtf, how?” than the others, but also Elisabeth Holmes is just incredibly odd and easy to laugh at."
Examination of Conscience,"WeCrashed is pretty good too, but Super Pumped is not my cup of tea."
Examination of Conscience,I’m not usually into these kinda shows but I’ve enjoyed WeCrashed so far.
Examination of Conscience,I’m still watching Super Pumped but it’s not great. The protagonist is obviously the villain but I feel like they’re trying and failing to make him look cool. Similar to Inventing Anna we see him having the effects of charm over people but we don’t see the charm. They also have some odd narration sequences where the show momentarily switches to a video game. One example there’s a business adversary and the show switches to an animated Mortal Kombat type game and he beheads the other guy. It’s weird.
Examination of Conscience,"Wecrashed and SP are fantastic, definitely worth getting into"
Examination of Conscience,"I’m finding it extremely difficult to watch because it’s based on a real story, haha. It’s just so cringey that this event took place."
Examination of Conscience,When he was told that they didn't know who he was and that they wouldn't go after Bezo's and Zuckerberg's girlfriends was so satisfying.
Examination of Conscience,"The grifting in silicon valley is indicative of the pitfalls of our economy on the whole.

It's teenagers and young adults that have checked the right boxes convincing VCs who can afford to lose dozens of millions or billions, and later institutional investors and eventually the public, that they can monopolize a part of the market by front running technology that is impossible or on a much larger time scale than promised.  


There was a time when the economy was filled with companies that deliverd on promises and progressed society and tech forward, not just scammed."
Examination of Conscience,I don't see how that show fits into the category.
Examination of Conscience,Like someone who's defrauding investors? Hard to be on top of that kind of thing ahead of time. Chris Robert's and Star Citizen come to mind as an ongoing cult like vaporware investment fraud.
Examination of Conscience,Look up fast company
Examination of Conscience,"Including Elizabeth Holmes’ weird makeup.  I can’t quite put my finger on what’s wrong, but I always compare it to Marilyn Manson."

Examination of Conscience,"> I’m still watching Super Pumped but it’s not great. The protagonist is obviously the villain but I feel like they’re trying and failing to make him look cool.

I don't think they've ever tried to make him appear cool - it's clear that the character fashions himself cool, but up against either more mature people (Kyle Chandler's character) or actual power players (the Google guys), he always comes off as lesser."
Examination of Conscience,I actually gave up after the second episode. I’ve watched the others and I like JGL a lot but SuperPumped is just boring.
Examination of Conscience,"isnt the whole thing with TK, not his charm, but the fact that he had almost free reign at uber, and bent everyone to his will? part of the story is how hard it was to actually oust him at the end of the day"
Examination of Conscience,">	There was a time when the economy was filled with companies that deliverd on promises and progressed society and tech forward, not just scammed.

Lolol no there wasn’t"
Examination of Conscience,"And as investors get more knowledgeable about tech and these kinds of scams, they will be in a better position to make smart decisions with their money in the future.

I'm not too familiar with what Holmes did, but I think most of these would-be founders actually believe their own bullshit. Different from an outright scam. We need to have people who believe in the impossible to progress. Sometimes that means coming up short."
Examination of Conscience,"lol I was going to say 

I mean it's a great show, but unless they tell us Kier Egan is some silicon valley tech bro, not sure how that works in this argument lol"
Examination of Conscience,I guess :( Sorry.
Examination of Conscience,"I guess not directly defrauding investors, but people who are rising meteorically  in terms of wealth and power. I appreciate your response, I'll check that out."
Examination of Conscience,"have you listened to the original ""The Dropout"" podcast?  that's really the gold standard for this story."
Examination of Conscience,"Kinda funny how Hulu has The Dropout and HBO has The Inventor, and Apple has WeCrashed and Hulu has WeWork."
Examination of Conscience,I don’t blame you. I’d recommend you watch the third episode just to see Ben Feldman as Larry Page though. It’s accurate but also hilarious.
Examination of Conscience,"Id argue it was the 30s to the 70s but also included the subjugation of a fifth of the population through Segregatoin and Jim Crow laws, and another quarter or even half through other racist and classist laws/oppression.  


Never got to a great place but better than now."
Examination of Conscience,"They aren't investing out of stupidity but rather greed and calculating themselves to be on the top of the pyramid and or incredible naivety. 

Intent doesn't matter much when you are doing a fraud.   


We can progress without risking peoples lives, destroying labor markets, or emptying hard working peoples pensions and retirements by defrauding them or setting up systems that reward and encourage the associated behaviors."

Examination of Conscience,"nah the gold standard is ""bad blood"" every other journalistic covering of theranos is mostly just reiterating john carreyrous original reporting."
Examination of Conscience,"Uh yeah no. 

There was never a time when a majority of companies were looking out for the good of the people. 

The “good ol days” are a myth People didn’t just magically get worse or something."
Examination of Conscience,The book is best
Examination of Conscience,"While that's not wrong, the book was published in 2018.  The story has progressed significantly since then.

The podcast is ongoing and up to date. 

With Holmes sentencing pending, and Sunny's trial starting tomorrow, there's still a lot of meat on this bone."
Examination of Conscience,I feel like amazon is REALLY hoping people will think it's connected to Us
Examination of Conscience,An unconvincing examination of American horror?!?! They fight giant ants with flamethrowers! How is that not... oh. This is a different Them.
Examination of Conscience,The title had me hoping for giant ants. I left disappointed.
Examination of Conscience,"On the 4th episode now. It's undoubtedly clear that the writer drew inspiration from Jordan Peele but that's not a bad thing at all. Terrific performances all round especially by the black father (who is kind of a legend in the UK grime scene). It has a lot of weird moments that oddly remind me of David Lynch's work. Even if you hate the show, you gotta admit that the cinematography is beautiful. I dig it but can understand why some don't."
Examination of Conscience,Is this show a copy of Lovecraft Country?
Examination of Conscience,Im on Episode 4th. It reminds me of the movie His House on Netflix and it has Channel Zero vibes.
Examination of Conscience,This looks good and I’m still gonna watch
Examination of Conscience,"this show was all over the place.  I have to give kudos to the two leads, they did a fantastic job, especially the mother character.  

It increasingly struck me that I was watching something akin to hate porn.  I don’t mind watching if there is a bigger message, but there isn’t.  

Also, does anyone know if Alison Pill is the same girl from Matchstick Men?  They look similar. 

Just feels like some mediocre film student got the budget they have always dreamed of.  This is a show only a sadist can enjoy.  Amazon shows are such a crapshoot.  Episode 9 was just - “what am I watching here?  who is this bearded Dutchman?”

Edit:  that said, if they make a season 2, I’m interested in lucky and Henry’s outcome"
Examination of Conscience,So is the Halloween episode of iCarly
Examination of Conscience,You mean this isn't about giant ants...?
Examination of Conscience,"If the main villain is racism, I don’t want to see it. I’m tired of “black pain” movies. 😒"
Examination of Conscience,Eh I’m excited about it
Examination of Conscience,[deleted]
Examination of Conscience,I plan to watch it. I’m impressed by Amazon Prime’s originals.
Examination of Conscience,"Oh Christ here come the people “tired of anti racism being shoved down their throats.” Bro black people in the us are tired of white people not getting racism, if you don’t wanna watch a show about racism then dont, stop acting like it’s in every bit of media you watch. 

That said I don’t want the field of historic race based pain explored through horror to be over saturated to the point where it’s inauthentic."
Examination of Conscience,No black person asked from this ever...
Examination of Conscience,"Supernatural + the real horror is racism 

This really feels like a copy from the theme to the direction so I hope they can throw in some curveballs story wise. I got tired of Lovecraft country by the end so we'll see how this goes. 

 I just don't think its a great combo besides the first few times, the two themes don't go well together.  The realness of historical racism really undermines the fake CGI spooky of whatever ghost or monster their trying to play up. The more real and horrible the racism the more silly the ghost/monster.  Its just not a good formula, Get Out didn't have anything supernatural and I think for that reason."
Examination of Conscience,"In other words, it’s not “woke” enough for modern media so the critics will lambast it."
Examination of Conscience,[deleted]
Examination of Conscience,"Honestly now that I think about it, this is blatant plagiarizing."
Examination of Conscience,"Did people like Us?  I saw it with some friends at the theater and we all left kind of confused.  The acting was good and a lot of the action scenes were well shot, but the plot was lackluster and I never really felt much tension or general ""scariness""."
Examination of Conscience,"I thought there would be giant mf ants! And boy was I let down.

Examination of Conscience,Can we please not make this into an Us versus Them thing please =P
Examination of Conscience,"I thought it was at first, between the title and the font and the general theme."
Examination of Conscience," . . .and afterall, we're only ordinary men."
Examination of Conscience,"I only saw one ad for it, but I assumer it was series in the same universe. Not gonna watch it now lol"
Examination of Conscience,I assumed it was a sequel.
Examination of Conscience,A classic ‘Us’ or ‘Them’ mentality
Examination of Conscience,I’m getting Lovecraft Country vibes from the trailer
Examination of Conscience,"I saw the title card, that’s exactly what I thought it was. A sequel to “Us”"
Examination of Conscience,It's very disrespectful to Gordon Douglas' original vision
Examination of Conscience,That poor kid in grayditch is still in that little shelter to this day

Examination of Conscience,He's British?!
Examination of Conscience,Felt that way too. Mashup of Lovecraft and US = Them
Examination of Conscience,"Same, still excited for it.  Do you know if it's dropping all at once?"
Examination of Conscience,That's what I thought at first. Was real confused.
Examination of Conscience,"Mind if I ask, is that how you saw ""us""? Because personally I think that movie had much more to say about class than it did about race specifically."
Examination of Conscience,"That's the thing. Why can't black people have a movie that's not about their pain? Why does everything have to be about their suffering? 

Edit: I just wanted to say there's a ton of good media that's not this. There's just not a lot of more recent big hollywood stuff. I worded my original comment poorly."
Examination of Conscience,[deleted]
Examination of Conscience,"Yeah, I’d really like to see a white pain movie where issues like having to deal with all these black pain movies gets addressed."
Examination of Conscience,"I’m not tired of “black pain” movies, because they’re really interesting to me. That said I think we may be reaching a point where they’re the battle royale of movies, and everyone is making one and they’re all just derivatives of other movies and they all get boring and shitty even if the first couple were really really good."
Examination of Conscience,"I just finished it and I agree. 

In my opinion, the show should've been about the family moving into that house. And it's a haunted house because the town is cursed since the old town folks killed the black couple. It should've fleshed out the supernatural aspect of it, with each family member dealing with something and with the racist neighbors just being a part of the family's struggles. 

Instead, it focused way too much on the borderline caricatural evil racist neighbors (and old town folks). And they filled the family's story arc with black-related trauma and graphic rape, graphic child murder and horrifying abuse obviously committed by these evil white folks (because racism is something that only bad people do!). There was nothing subtle here or food for thought, it was just shock value. I feel like 75% of the show wasn't even ""horror"", it was black people in distress. Been there, done that! And the ""real horror"" aspect of it, which I found more interesting, was hard to follow."
Examination of Conscience,"What’s fucked up is the majority of the comments here seem to be espousing that gross shit about being “tired of media about black pain” 

I mean I know it’s 40% of America but, still."
Examination of Conscience,"Horror just allows that painful history to be explored from a safe distance, especially for white people. But it also allows for certain things without them feeling too much like torture porn. This is where Antebellum sort of fliundered."
Examination of Conscience,the ones getting paid to make it certainly did
Examination of Conscience,"When all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail"
Examination of Conscience,"The font is similar, too"
Examination of Conscience,It has the same actress who played the daughter in Us as well.
Examination of Conscience,I saw the trailer and assumed Jordan Peele was involved. Is he not?
Examination of Conscience,Somewhere out there is a lawyer taking screenshots of this conversation to use as exhibit A in their lawsuit for copyright infringement.
Examination of Conscience,Another form of blacksploitation?
Black Earth Rising,"Interested in seeing Michaela Coel doing a dramatic role, because she is so funny in Chewing Gum."
Black Earth Rising,"I am really, really enjoying it. Maybe this doesn't appeal to mass  (white) audiences but I like how they tackled so many issues of racism and colonialism existing even in the 21st century. I'm always happy to see a show that brings such forgotten stories into the spotlight."
Black Earth Rising,"From the creator of The Honourable Woman, I’m in.
"
Black Earth Rising,"It was a decent series. When BBC marketed it they acted like it was going to be the next Bodyguard but it wasn’t. It wasn’t bad, but it wasn’t Bodyguard quality."
Black Earth Rising,I remember her from Black Mirror.
Black Earth Rising,This looks very meh but I’m super happy John Goodman is getting so much work these days. He’s legit one of my favorite actors and people in general. From Roseanne to Speed Racer to Kong and everything in between. I love that man. 
Black Earth Rising,"This show is awesome, but it’s not for those who’s feelings are easily hurt when it comes to subjects like colonialism. also it is pretty clear on the fact that the world doesn’t revolve around or need a European person to decide what’s good and right for countries of color. At least in the beginning. The voices of the people of color are strong in this series, the music is great, and the story (so far) is compelling. I expect it to be downplayed because it’s taking some pretty strong jabs at how many people think the world should be run. "
Black Earth Rising,Pretty average show. 
Black Earth Rising,This show already flopped in UK.
Black Earth Rising,That girl from Chewing Gum? Omg I'll watch this!!
Black Earth Rising,From the title I thought it would be a scifi about a parallel Earth that is black instead of blue. Got disappointed.
Black Earth Rising,"Hoky shit the ""daughter"" Kate it wgetever is a gross person. "
Black Earth Rising,Have you seen black mirror
Black Earth Rising,They did a great job dealing with the nuance of racism and neo colonialism. It starts off heavy hitting and ends with a soft termination of her old ‘white managed’ life and into her new life as a character at home spiritually and physically. It’s a beautiful and sad series. It feels like it was calling everyone to return to their roots. 
Black Earth Rising,It is made by white hating trash 
Black Earth Rising,"Bodyguard quality is not a high standard to hold, that show was just ok"
Black Earth Rising,"Bodyguard is pretty decent show with some great scenes, but wasn’t out of this world."
Black Earth Rising,Flopped how?  It's very well reviewed and the ratings weren't bad either
Black Earth Rising,How? 
Black Earth Rising,Yeah I remember her from Star Trek esque episode. 
Black Earth Rising,"That show was a total zeitgeist though, or at least in the UK. It was super tight and thrilling, which is what made it popular. You can see why it was so massive when watching it, and this show doesn’t have that same kind of excitement.

Bodyguard was nowhere near as good as Jed Mercurio’s other show Line Of Duty though. Now that show is fucking spectacular. One of the best shows on TV."
Black Earth Rising,It was a great show though.
Black Earth Rising,"Seriously, found myself asking if I was actually watching the same show as all these other people. "
Black Earth Rising,The British public are tired of immigrant propaganda. 
Black Earth Rising,"She's also the airline stewardess in ""Nosedive""."
Black Earth Rising,Yeah she's pretty good
Black Earth Rising,"It was amazing for the first few episodes, but after the climax, it kinda just whimpered out (mainly cuz the ""conspiracy"" was unsatisfying). "
Black Earth Rising,I binged line of duty recently and it was amazing!! Especially the theme music
Black Earth Rising,"I much preferred BER to Bodyguard, but they are different beasts, in pacing and tone."
Black Earth Rising,You put it much better than I did. 
Black Earth Rising,Which this isn’t. Unless the subject being Africa makes it about immigration because... reasons?
Black Earth Rising,How the hell is a story about the Rwandan genocide “immigrant propaganda”? Get it together mate. 
Black Earth Rising,I haven't watched it because it just doesn't look interesting to me. 
Black Earth Rising,"I'm only five episodes deep, but it's really pulled me in.  Two thumbs, five stars so far. "
Black Earth Rising,"Compelling characters. Rooted in history, inevitable corruption, neocolonialism (modern corporations-backed-by-state-departments version) and UN attempts at justice. Plenty of twists, bad guys, good guys, and compromised guys. Justice one way or another all around—some gruesome, but mostly you just know what happened. (One conflicted character has a real metaphorical concept of justice.) The scenery is rich, but the title might be wrong. The earth is decidedly red, but maybe drenched in blood it turns black. 

I liked it. John Goodman’s in it. "
Black Earth Rising,All the market ting I saw really screamed the sum will not equal the value of its parts.
Black Earth Rising,"It’s excellent. I absolutely loved it. A number if absolutely incredible performances; the lead is great. It’s complex, the odd typically “shady character” storyline that comes from Hugo Blick’s stuff (he wrote the amazing Honourable Woman, and an earlier series The Shadow Line is quite good, if not as good as these two.)

Amazing soundtrack by Martin Phipps too. The music is very very powerful."
Black Earth Rising,"I thought it looked potentially interesting. I was just waiting to see what others have to say about the politics. Whether it was an accurate look at this complicated and horrific event or if it fell into the, ""white man's fault for everything."" Sadly you just can't trust drama's these days to be unbiased and not pushing an agenda. 

I've been to Rwanda, nice place but the genocide stuff is horrific. "
Black Earth Rising,Same for me. There is simply so much content out there nowadays that I pass on most things if I wasn't intrigued or interested by the trailer. 
Black Earth Rising,I watched it because it looked interesting to me. I wish I hadn't.
Black Earth Rising,I've had *You Want It Darker* stuck in my head all week.
Black Earth Rising,Agreed! I just started the series not too long ago and the soundtrack is incredible! 
Black Earth Rising,Watch it and find out for yourself. It’s a pretty nuanced look
Black Earth Rising,"So, what does unbiased mean to you? ‘Everything isn’t the white mans fault’? Because that’s not unbiased that is just a narrative that makes white people more comfortable. Neo colonialism is a reality and it’s affects on the continent of Africa are horrific. Discussing modern day African politics without including neo colonialism and the degradation, disenfranchisement and distraction of the African people by white countries is a bit remiss. To put it nicely. "
Black Earth Rising,"Why didn't you like it? I'm on episode 3 and I'm really liking it. I'm not well versed on African politics or conflicts at tall, so I'm wondering if people don't like it because of how they represent the whole situation and conflict, or if people don't like it because they just think it's bad or boring. "
Black Earth Rising,"I agree, it never presents anything as black and white. Very interesting to watch."
Black Earth Rising,Cheers. I am planning on checking it out.
Black Earth Rising,"Unbiased is just factual but with depth. I know a bit about the history of Africa, I have even been to 14 different countries there. A lot of the issues run deep, it wasn't Wakanda and then the French came and stuffed it up (still do today). So it's just wondering how deep you go, or how superficial and how that tells the story.

It's more a comment on I have little faith in the current climate of TV, would they'd want to go deep and admit these things are complicated. Instead of the illusion of depth, speak to a certain political leaning where everyone walks away with that affirmed, feeling they've watched something smart and deep. When they really haven't."
Black Earth Rising,"Wakanda isn’t real and it’s insulting to suggest that people think Africa was (at one point) an Afro-futuristic society. A lot of Africa’s issues as a continent revolve around neo colonialism. The countries in Africa were the first to develop many things that still exist today thanks to their theft. So suggesting that it was some war torn continent prior to being colonized is ignorant. 

However, the show reflects Rwanda the way more television should, as a country with a complicated past that was exacerbated by French politics and suffered for it. It is a smart and deep show with lots of levels but I doubt you would like it since it solidly places colonialism as part of The problem. There is no getting around history anymore, the infectious hand of Europe has created many rifts and wars in a country that was rich in natural resources. Trying to side step that will always lead to a twisted narrative that makes whites, even well traveled and educated, uncomfortable and Africa responsible for problems it didn’t create. "
Black Earth Rising,"That description makes it sound worthwhile. My issue wasn't showing the place of colonialism in the problem. It was about whether the show would make it the sole problem. 

The Wakanda reference was just to reflect peoples idealised views that everything pre-colonisation was perfect everywhere in the world. Particularly by really ignorant people. Tribal conflicts and even how violent literally everywhere on earth was, is ignored. This is a problem because this gets to the core of so many problems in history and the world today. Surely you've seen that kind of stuff online? There's a real denial of who all humans are and how this manifested in history and today. It happens everywhere in the planet, in part because the history isn't recorded or if it was, it was destroyed. That's not to say it wasn't exploited and used by colonisers in Africa. It explains their actions, it explains how they were able to do things, and it explains conflicts today.

> Africa were the first to develop many things that still exist today thanks to their theft. 

I'm not sure the point you're making here, I was never implying there was nothing worthwhile or valuable in Africa and African culture. What kind of things are you talking about?

Oh, that explains it. (also, !! Hugo Blick!)

Love him or hate him, you have to admire Blick for being one of the few folks who can pull off being a television auteur. He wrote/produced/directed every episode of *The Honourable Woman,* and I'm betting he's done the same for *Black Earth Rising.* [Netflix is bringing it over to the US](https://www.netflix.com/title/80145141)."
Black Earth Rising,Chewing Gum fan! Dope show. Weird as hell but a lotta fun
Black Earth Rising,Didnt like Kate Ashby’s character at all!! She’s constantly screaming at people. Grew up in England and remembers nothing but has most of the breakdowns while people who witnessed the butchering of innocents have no where near the same type of outbursts. 
Black Earth Rising,"Watched this over the weekend and I think I’d give it a B or B-. Great cast, great setting and premise, but I’d wager the show was trying to do too much. Every episode has so many twists, turns, shocks, revelations and resolutions that it became disorienting. Like I had to do a double take that in that big event that happened a while back was actually only 20 minutes ago! If the show has a more limited focus and was only 4-6 episodes it would have been much better in my view. "
Black Earth Rising,"Too bad it’s got bad reviews, love the cast"
Black Earth Rising,"trauma effects people in different ways. One lady was the opposite, not able to speak. "
Black Earth Rising,I don’t think you understand how trauma affects people. I hope you’ll never find out. This portrayal is very real. Everyone handles it differently. 
Black Earth Rising,I agree. It has all the makings of a good show but couldnt mesh all of it together. I lost interest half way through it.
Black Earth Rising,"From what I can see it doesn't look like it got [bad reviews](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/black_earth_rising/s01/) in the UK?

Personally I thought it was pretty bad, so I'm with this guy, but others seemed to like it?"
Black Earth Rising,Has a good 7/10 on RT and 6.5 on IMBD. How is that bad ratings? 
Black Earth Rising,"It's Hugo Blick *(The Honourable Woman, The Shadow Line)*. You either love him or you hate him.  Most UK reviewers love him.  I always know what he'll put in front of me will be challenging, and probably worth it, but it won't be an easy or comfortable view.  And it really doesn't surprise me some *Variety* critic hated it.

Blick is singular in that he's a tv auteur: he writes, produces, and directs every episode."
Black Earth Rising,Yeah sorry I guess the reviews aren’t horrible. Maybe I should have said mixed reviews. I usually base my selections off a mixture of user reviews from IMDb and rotten tomatoes with some exceptions. If a show is under 7/10 on IMDb I usually skip it but if it’s a matter of the show just being too smart for the average viewer I would still give it a watch as I like to be challenged and can’t stand being able to call what’s going to happen next. 
Black Earth Rising,">I always know what he'll put in front of me will be challenging, and probably worth it, but it won't be an easy or comfortable view.

That's some bullshit. The ""it's too smart for some folks,""  or ""they're not watching it correctly"" takes are always trash.

And Blick writes propulsive thrillers. David Lynch films they are not.

I liked *The Honourable Woman* when I watched it. A lot. I thought *Black Earth Rising* was maybe the worst show I watched last year."
Black Earth Rising,So you enjoyed this then?
Black Earth Rising,"Haven't seen it yet as it's only aired in the UK. But since I loved both *The Honourable Woman* and *The Shadow Line,* I'm looking forward to when it drops on US Netflix (Jan. 25).  To me, the [trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNb5w1ERY8E) looked good. YMMV."
Black Earth Rising,"I liked it, Goodman is great as always "
Black Earth Rising,[deleted]
Black Earth Rising,"I didn't like it, frankly. I'll be curious to see how folks in the U.S., critics and audience members, receive it when it comes to Netflix (no release date yet I don't think)."
Black Earth Rising,I did too.
Black Earth Rising,"I thought it was very well written, well acted, and well shot. The casting I thought was decent enough, considering the practical limitations of using a mainly UK cast to tell a mostly Rwandan story.

Edit: I see The Guardian gave it 5 stars, and it's at 100% on Rotten Tomatoes."
Black Earth Rising,"I'm curious to see how folks in East Africa receive it. Particularly the writing and cinematography, as opposed to the casting or acting. I imagine many would find the casting jarring or weird, if not somewhat offensive (West African faces playing Rwandan characters)."
Black Earth Rising,"It seems so according to IMDB: [https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7660730/fullcredits/?ref\_=tt\_ov\_st\_sm](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7660730/fullcredits/?ref_=tt_ov_st_sm)

Such a shame there isn't more talk about this series. 

&#x200B;"
Black Earth Rising,"The opening theme song is 'You Want it Darker' by Leonard Cohen. If your asking who does the internal music in the episodes then I'm afraid I don't know, but I'm sure the person is listed somewhere online if not in the credits."
Black Earth Rising,I'm very anxious for this to hit Netflix her in the states. Unfortunately there isn't even a release date yet.
Black Earth Rising,When she said they will show a simulation of how how ancient cities were built and then they showed a minecraft building video 😂
Black Earth Rising,"This show is almost as good as Belgian techno anthem ""Pump Up the Jam."""
Black Earth Rising,"“The most notorious Roman until Polanski”

I lost it for a good three minutes at this line."
Black Earth Rising,"There's also Cunk on Britain and a few others.  One on Christmas, I think"
Black Earth Rising,"Dance like no one is watching.

-Aristotle"
Black Earth Rising,This is a bacus
Black Earth Rising," “If I ever see Christ again, he’s a dead man” -Paul"
Black Earth Rising,"“So hang on, if I think therefore I am, what about other people? Do they think therefore they am? How can I tell if they're thinking therefore they am? Or am I just thinking they think therefore they am, but actually they're not real and I'm only thinking they am? Are you thinking therefore you am right now?”

Dead"
Black Earth Rising,I can only handle 15 minutes at a time. It gets to a point where I get so irritated but it’s hilarious. Internal struggle.
Black Earth Rising,"One of my favourite Qunks (a Cunk Quote) is  “In the Middle Ages, did they know it was the Middle Ages, or did they just think, ‘this is now’? How did they know they were halfway through time?”"
Black Earth Rising,Her description of her castle was marvelous. The foley artists must have had a blast doing that. So many great moments and the timing is incredible. Im gonna watch it again a couple times.
Black Earth Rising,PUMP UP THE JAM PUMP IT UP-
Black Earth Rising,What is clocks?
Black Earth Rising,"The Ghengis Khan ""Mongoling free"" line nearly killed me, just thrown in there all casual like"
Black Earth Rising,I watched the first episode yesterday and found myself laughing out loud quite a few times. I was completely sold ten minutes in. The joke about how we can make breathtaking simulations of ancient ruins with modern technology... And then it's just Minecraft footage. Amazing.
Black Earth Rising,"I don’t usually go in for these shenanigans but this show is unique and edited so that jokes land with perfect precision.

When she was shocked in ep 4 (?) that nuclear weapons are still a thing and that Britain’s stockpile isn’t full of blanks, I was surprised the actress was able to cry so convincingly- your run of the mill sitcom actress couldn’t do it quite like this.

Are the “experts” actors or real experts? I’m almost certain they’re (coached) real professionals in their fields.

It really is a 10/10 show for its genre."
Black Earth Rising,"They created fire, prolonging their already tedious lives"
Black Earth Rising,What is this style of comedy called? The Daily Show did it…taking the piss while interviewing experts. Great stuff
Black Earth Rising,Soviet Onion
Black Earth Rising,"I just binged everything, I loved it. She's so dumb but with few notes of vulnerability towards the end, and the show often have interesting social comments while deliberately using terrible shortcuts and stupid shit.

I'm gonna try to find the Cunk on Britain one, and hope they do more on Netflix."
Black Earth Rising,"""My mate Paul says that the media tries to cover it up, just because it's not true."""
Black Earth Rising,"When she tried to cancel the historian for implying the Renaissance was more important than Single Ladies by Beyonce lmfaooo

(to be fair Beyonce just released an album called Renaissance)"
Kingdom,Trailer does not include anyone yelling “SHIELD [long pause] WALL!!”. Deeply concerned.
Kingdom,"Uthred son of Uthred is a great character. 

I am really looking forward to this. In my opinion, this was the best show dealing with Viking theme."
Kingdom,So hyped for more Uhtred son of Uhtred
Kingdom,I am Uhtred son of Uhtred
Kingdom,"Fuck yes.  I finally got around to watching the final season of The Last Kingdom over the past couple of weeks, so it must be... *destiny* that this is coming soon."
Kingdom,"One of my favorite shows of all time, really looking forward to this. Destiny is all!"
Kingdom,Anybody misread the title as Stephen King must die?
Kingdom,"Trailer needed more Finan, but excited nonetheless."
Kingdom,The modern day James Bond. Every season begins or ends with his previous missus dying and him immediately shacking up with a new lady. Be hard pressed to fit that cycle into a 2 hour movie.
Kingdom,"well, that's a lot of kings to assassinate"
Kingdom,"Uthred the Ageless - outlived young Edward.

Pretty hyped tho, ngl"
Kingdom,Best Viking show/movie I’ve ever seen
Kingdom,I was disappointed with the final season but I’m excited to see this
Kingdom,"Also astonishing how many can't read 

Maybe not so surprising in a tv sub tho"
Kingdom,Used to be one of my favorite shows till season 3. But season 4 made me lose all interest and killed my love for it. Did it get any better afterwards?
Kingdom,"Anyone else read the title at first glance as, ""Steven King Must Die""?"
Kingdom,"Anybody else misread the title as ""Buttvirgins #24""?"
Kingdom,"Another one of  the ""everyone in medieval time wore brown or black, even the noble´s, it,s dark and  muddy and whitewash for walls surely is a 21th century invention"" style movies.

This one with a unique new angle of "" i may be wearing a bearskin cloak and a warriors haircut and still can´t afford any nicely made clothes but i just REALLY like expressive eye make up."""
Kingdom,Yes! One of my all time favorites Shows! Destiny is all!
Kingdom,"I read this as Steve King’s Must Die — The Last Kingdom sequel — and was simultaneously confused and excited. I’m a bit let down, but still excited to see Uhtred son of Uhtred."
Kingdom,It is my destiny to watch this.
Kingdom,"I know it's good but I just don't have the time to watch The Last Kingdom. So my question is, do you guys think I can watch this without watching the series? Can the story stand alone?"
Kingdom,"Ahh. 

Was hoping it wouldn't be him vs uthred after rewatch recently..but of course"
Kingdom,"At first very brief glance I thought it said 'Steven King Must Die' and was like hm, what's all this? 
(Yes I know it's Stephen, that's just what my brain initially did)"
Kingdom,"It''s not cinema movie, right?"
Kingdom,Thought this said Stephen King Must Die
Kingdom,"Uthred son of Uthred son of Uthred son of Uthred!

Destiny is all"
Kingdom,Wyrd bið ful aræd.
Kingdom,How was thr final season? I got rather bored 4 episodes in to the last season. Did it get better
Kingdom,"I can't help but think of the railway station in London. 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven\_Kings"
Kingdom,"
No but I’d watch that too"
Kingdom,"Not really, it sort of just found its level and stayed around that for the most part."
Kingdom,I did!
Kingdom,The show doesn't make any claims to be historically accurate
Kingdom,Probably but you’ll regret it.
Kingdom,Fate is inexorable
Kingdom,Uthred of Bababba
Kingdom,Yes the nostalgia!
Kingdom,You forgot Uhtred brother of Uhtred.
Kingdom,[deleted]
Kingdom,"same, last thing i remember is there being a huge plague plotline right in the beginning of covid lol"
Kingdom,I see. That's a shame. Was one of the best shows around in its first three seasons.
Kingdom,"Im not really criticising that. Even if it looks like , i will give you that.

It´s just lazy filmmaking. Apparently film people think this drab boring costume and prop stuff has been conditioned onto the audience and they can get away with it. Probably way cheaper than paying some guys to design and make some nice looking stuff.

Any basic bbc history documentation has better looking costumes and set."
Kingdom,Did 5 get better? I watched 4 episodes and was bored. The original magic seemed gone
Kingdom,"The action felt better than GoT at times. Writing and acting was obviously a long way distant, but as a show I preferred it to GoT S4+"
Kingdom,Who knows why Hollywood decides to do what it does. My theory is the producers think it looks cooler haha
Kingdom,"I am ready for some I am Uhtred, son of Uhtred, father of Uhtred, grandfather of Uhtred, great grandfather of Uhtred.

also if Uhtred gets with Eadith in the movie, then RIP.  

you had a good run Eadith."
Kingdom,Can't wait for this. Destiny is all!
Kingdom,Maybe Uhtred will finally get a grey hair
Kingdom,"Can’t wait. The finale to s5 was an incredible closing to the story, but I’m really excited to see where this movie goes. One of my favorite series ever"
Kingdom,"I watched all five seasons in about three weeks few weeks back. What a ride, amazing show overall. Can't wait for the movie, but sad it will be the last thing made from it."
Kingdom,Uhtred son of Uhtred!
Kingdom,Awesome!
Kingdom,If you like the show then I 💯recommend reading the Books if you haven’t already!
Kingdom,"Fuck you, now I'm remembering >!Aethelflaed's death!< and how it emotionally destroyed me."
Kingdom,"Let me guess, he wants to retake Bebebbanbnburhg

Some new evil guy shows up that has a new schtick

His wife dies

Just when he's about to set off on his quest, he gets pulled into the King's politics and he has to either do him a favour, or avoid making him an enemy."
Kingdom,Destiny is all!
Kingdom,Awesome though shame to see it ending.  Best show on Netflix.
Kingdom,"Such a great show, and stayed strong till the end, I hope, unlike some others."
Kingdom,"hah love this show, it ain't no big masterpiece but surprisingly solid all the way, which is far more than many so called *prestige shows* can say since they turn to shit after the third episode. Also, Uthred and Young Uthred always made me think about Blackadder's Pitt The Younger and Pitt the Even Younger"
Kingdom,Probably the best show Netflix has ever put out.  Although I think it was a bbc show initially
Kingdom,"would you recommend this show? How would you describe it? (ex: thrones meets the sopranos)


Also if you recommend this show can you tell me some other shows you like"
Kingdom,That's some good news for once
Kingdom,Now do an adaption of the warlord chronicles
Kingdom,I had no idea this was coming. Can't wait now!
Kingdom,I need to watch this. I have read most of the books. No idea what I am waiting for.
Kingdom,SHIELD WALL
Kingdom,"Love the bit were he jumps over the shield wall and cuts them all from behind, bad ass af"
Kingdom,The series that just won't die. Strange it's on Netflix.
Kingdom,Last season blood CGI was so ugly. Please stop using bad blood CGI. Ruins it for me.
Kingdom,"Friendly reminder, nothing made by Netflix requires a Netflix account to access."
Kingdom,"Shit, keep forgetting to pick this back up."
Kingdom,Cant wait!!!
Kingdom,Destiny is all!
Kingdom,"NGL Alexander Dreymon was a bit of an acquired taste for me. Not sure why but am glad I saw it through. 

Will be looking forward to this even if half the movie is just him reading a genesis for all the Uhtreds."
Kingdom,"Funny, I was just talking about this the other day."
Kingdom,I swear the beginning of each episode with the recap and he always said that. Lmao.  That got planted in my head that if he didn't say that on the next episode. I would be disappointed lol
Kingdom,">	Also if Uhtred gets with Eadith in the movie, then RIP. 

I used to watch a show called Chicago fire with a character named Kelly Severide. For drama purposes they’d kill a character every season. I realized you could predict who it would be by whoever started dating Severide. If a character started dating him you knew they wouldn’t be around by the end of the season. They’d unintentionally made him the most tragic character in history."
Kingdom,*Loud lamenting singing begins*
Kingdom,I am Uhtred of Bebbanburg and password sharing will no longer be tolerated!
Kingdom,DESTINY IS ALL
Kingdom,"I really, really hate that translation. In the books, it’s translated as “Fate is inexorable.” Which is a slightly shortened quote from the Old English poem “The Wanderer.” It has a very different meaning."
Kingdom,How dare you! Uhtred will never show glimpse of age
Kingdom,"For real, it's been a while since I watched but doesn't the series cover like 40 something years?"
Kingdom,Wait … there’s a fifth season?! How did I miss that!?
Kingdom,"I agree! What I loved about the finale to S05 is that honestly, it could pickup for a season 6 or end right there. The Last Kingdom is, to me, a perfect show."
Kingdom,Wait a fucking minute....S5 came out ?!?!
Kingdom,Amazing finale
Kingdom,"And the the Warlord Trilogy, and the Archers tale. And Azincourt, etc. but especially the Warlord Trilogy."
Kingdom,"I recommend the books even if you don’t like the show! I couldn’t get into the show at all, it just wasn’t the same world as the one in my head from the books. Was still cool to see that there was enough interest to turn it into such a long running show!"
Kingdom,"lol, I enjoyed the show but this is pretty accurate."
Kingdom,"I hope, yeah."
Kingdom,What happened to Bebbanburg?  The show ends with him taking it.
Kingdom,"The Last Kingdom kind of ruined Vikings for me because TLK is so much richer and more detailed. There is a pattern of rug-pulling in the storylines that does become annoying, but it is a phenomenal series and easily one of the best things on Netflix."
Kingdom,Show is so good. The only show that I’ve watched through beginning to end several times. Highly recommended
Kingdom,"Absolutely. It's historical fiction, compared to GoT fantasy but both have that gritty element so if you liked that about GoT...

I think of it as Adventure television, like Robin of Sherwood, Uhtred is heroic but not always likable 

The closest comparison is probably Sharpe (which I've never seen) because Bernard Cornwell wrote both series. It's also synonymous in my mind with Poldark but that's because it was always shown about the same time of year.

What I appreciate about the show is the secondary characters, especially King Alfred and his family. There's good story arcs and relationships develop in interesting ways."
Kingdom,"It goes downhill after season 3 (after a certain character exits the show), , but overall still enjoyable with a conclusive ending."
Kingdom,"I’m also curious.  The books were great fun, and I’m a bit hesitant to watch the show in case it doesn’t live up."
Kingdom,"Shockingly good for what's a pseudo-historic swords drama. The writing is hovers around above average, and is mostly consistent. The directing is good, and the performances are generally solid. I'd recommend it to anyone looking for something in the genre."
Kingdom,"I've only really watched the first season, so I can't speak too much about the rest (though I'm continuing to watch as I enjoyed the first season) but it felt... kind of like watching a playthrough of Assassin's Creed: Valhalla, which makes sense given the subject material.

It feels a little less graphic than Game of Thrones in terms of sex, though in terms of violence probably similar to it. There are a few times where the character just makes... really dumb choices, even though you can tell it's supposed to be because they're hotheaded or whatever, so it sometimes has that Shameless feel to it where the characters are doing something because plot as opposed to it feeling as organic as it could. (I'm thinking of one specific event in a church toward the end of the first season.)"
Hidden Worlds,"So, I guess their goal today was to take everyone who said D+ had no original content besides The Mandalorian, and pretty much punch them in the face repeatedly."
Hidden Worlds,Hooch is crazy

Hidden Worlds,/u/arashtp you missed Percy Jackson.
Hidden Worlds,Super stoked on most of this. I’m especially looking forward to the Nat geo content. Can you imagine if Disney+ dropped with half of these titles? Game changer
Hidden Worlds,"Based on the release timelines of those shows, it looks like their strategy is:

Hidden Worlds,They're really going all out with the High Republic.
Hidden Worlds,did She Hulk get a trailer or anything?
Hidden Worlds,that's a lot of content
Hidden Worlds,"So strange to realize Ice Age is owned by Disney now.

Hidden Worlds,"A lot of this is awesome, but can I just take a moment to appreciate *Sister Act 3*?"
Hidden Worlds,">Tiana is the first princess to have her own Walt Disney Animation Studios series

Just going to ignore the Little Mermaid and Tangled series apparently."
Hidden Worlds,[deleted]
Hidden Worlds,I have only read a hand full of moon knight comics but from what I have heard and read making a PG moon knight show is not going to go over well with fans.
Hidden Worlds,Any specific dates to go with this?
Hidden Worlds,You forgot the multiple tongue in cheek references to Matt Murdock.  Charlie Cox's Daredevil is officially part of the MCU now.  Hes apparently in She Hulk and Spider-Man 3.
Hidden Worlds,"Damn, the Ducks end up becoming what they rebelled against..."
Hidden Worlds,"As a bi dude I'm still waiting for literally anything big that features a non-straight dude. In film they ignored it almost completely out of fear of gay-hating countries banning it and them losing money (like China). 

Really hoping for something to come through, maybe with x-men back in the fold Iceman could get something"
Hidden Worlds,So is Ahsoka taking the place of the Rebels spinoff? Because thats what I was most excited for
Hidden Worlds,Disney is milking Star Wars and Marvel for everything dollar they can squeeze. There are way too many reboots and remakes. They need originally sourced content that has no reliance on existing IP. How about some original NON-Marvel/Star Wars scripted content? I think the Mandalorian is a cute show but I want to see ORIGINAL content for once. This slate of shows are not enough to keep all of their subscribers satisfied.
Hidden Worlds,I just want to have the spin off Thrawn and Ezra travels in space show.
Hidden Worlds,"Hey, bozo, why didn't you mention It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia?

Great list, otherwise."
Hidden Worlds,so much content that post alone made me vomit .
Hidden Worlds,Seems like Star Wars's future is on TV.
Hidden Worlds,Is it weird that I'm most excited for the Josh Peck version of Turner and Hooch?
Hidden Worlds,"Looks like they're updating Microcosmos with A Real Bug's Life, that should be cool as fuck."
Hidden Worlds,">The Mighty Ducks: Game Changers

>Lauren Graham (Gilmore Girls, Parenthood) and Emilio Estevez (reprising his role from the original feature films) star in the next chapter of the hit Mighty Ducks franchise, premiering in early 2021. In present day Minnesota, the Mighty Ducks have evolved from scrappy underdogs to an ultra-competitive, powerhouse youth hockey team. After 12-year-old Evan is unceremoniously cut from the Ducks, he and his mom Alex set out to build their own ragtag team of misfits to challenge the cutthroat, win-at-all-costs culture of competitive youth sports.

I hope Disney has been paying attn to Cobra Kai and takes all the good from it and applies it to the Ducks!!!"
Hidden Worlds,"Man, Tony Stark cannot keep control of his tech, can he? Well, I guess he's dead, so that makes sense."
Hidden Worlds,The one thing I want from Marvel is an OG Nick Fury and the Howling Commandos show.
Hidden Worlds,They forgot Shadow Hunters.
Hidden Worlds,Disney+ launch was more like beta test to ensure their decision of allocating such resources to the platform
Hidden Worlds,"The criticism was regarding lack of original screenplays, too. It's still true in that aspect."
Hidden Worlds,"It's still lacks diversity, it's still marvel, star wars and Pixar animated pg-13 movies, still no new new IPs."

Hidden Worlds,Thanks man you're awesome
Hidden Worlds,[Rogue squadron](https://youtu.be/5bLkTjn6Y_s)
Hidden Worlds,Not enough 🚀🚀🚀
Hidden Worlds,"Just hints at Daredevil, from Sony in Spider-Man 3 and at the reveal here today for She-Hulk."
Hidden Worlds,"Yeah sounds like the Multiverse in SM3 will pull in Daredevil and Kingpin. Which could be great.

Daredevil was hinted at strongly for SheHulk, and there have been rumors that DNofrio has campaigned hard and they’ve taken him seriously as maybe using his character to put together the Sinister Six."
Hidden Worlds,"There's a big hint in Hawkeye. Maya Lopez is a definitively Daredevil character (Echo, a deaf woman who can see something once and imitate it originally hired by Kingpin to take out Daredevil and eventually befriending him). She also wore the Ronin outfit for awhile that Hawkeye wore in Endgame after his family vanished (New Avengers comics).

Edit: why am I being downvoted for this?"
Hidden Worlds,And Swiss Family Robinson.
Hidden Worlds,It’s pretty genius
Hidden Worlds,Super into the Acolyte as I’d really like to see what the Sith/dark side users were up to during this time period
Hidden Worlds,"No, but they confirmed Tatiana Maslany."
Hidden Worlds,Tim Roth will be back as Abomination and Mark Ruffalo.
Hidden Worlds,Its a rather deceptive line if your not in the know.  WDAS is the movie studio. Disney Television Animation is the studio that typically handles the TV side (they were the ones that made the Tangled series).
Hidden Worlds,That's not necessarily a bad thing tbh. It's how they execute it that matters. GOTG was kinda considered a bottom of the barrel IP for marvel before they made it and it turned out well.
Hidden Worlds,"There’s like 70 announced shows here and less than 10 are actual original ideas. Really disappointing *in my opinion*.

I get people like Star Wars and stuff, but it seems extreme to me."
Hidden Worlds,"I think it could be done. For me at least the fun part is the mind-bendy unreliable narrator stuff and not the graphic violence. Although there is something to be said for when other characters meet Moon Knight and are like, ""oh this guy is *crazy* crazy and not just *Batman* crazy."""
Hidden Worlds,"This didn’t mention any of the Marvel movies since it’s still not certain whether they’ll be released in theaters first or on Disney+ at the same time, but The Eternals is set to have their first openly gay main character whenever that’s released.

If you haven’t watched the Disney+ short film Out, you absolutely should."
Hidden Worlds,"Young Avengers is just over the horizon, and that comes with the most prominent gay couple in marvel. Still a few years out though."
Hidden Worlds,Not sure if it is 100% confirmed but I remember seeing somewhere that Valkyrie is looking for a wife in the next Thor movie.
Hidden Worlds,"As a fellow homo, I'm sorry you're getting downvoted, but that's r/television for you. I've learned not to bring up representation issues on this sub anymore."
Hidden Worlds,"I would bet it will be in a team, or they will reveal the character is gay in a sequel...that way people in China will already be invested.  Because you’re right....they want that China money badly. 


Wouldn’t it be a kick in the nuts to China if the wait until like Shang Chi 3 and reveal he was gay the whole time! Lmao. That could literally start a war!!"
Hidden Worlds,"I feel like this'll be a big part of the Ashoka show, considering that she was still searching when we see her in The Mandolorian."
Hidden Worlds,Thats not on Disney+ you 1 star fool.
Hidden Worlds,That’s pathetic
Hidden Worlds,I really don't like the sound of this. The whole point of the Ducks is that they are scrappy underdogs. Having them become what they played against feels kind of weird. And it's obviously gonna end with both Ducks teams playing against each other. It just sounds weird to me.
Hidden Worlds,"They're going all in because they've lost all profits from Disney parks and tourism, 75% of their revenue.

Also why they gutted ESPN"
Hidden Worlds,"Certainly, but was anyone really expecting that? Aside from Pixar, Disney hasn't done an original story in... I'm not sure. Possibly ever."
Hidden Worlds,Pixar films are all new IPs lol
Hidden Worlds,[deleted]
Hidden Worlds,One Star Wars IP will drive more total interest than anything on HBO Max lmao
Hidden Worlds,"Uh ""Win or Lose"" is a new IP."
Hidden Worlds,"You are soo right. Marvel has been overdone, it's a stale medium at this point.  SW feels the same after the last 3 movies. Even Mando is aimless with no real main plotline.

It's so formulaic it isn't appealing.

Will smith movie,
Cars tv show, 
SW, SW, SW, SW, SW
Marvel movies or shows of all side movie characters, because why not saturate the market with bland superheros"
Hidden Worlds,"Yeah. Did anyone really expect Disney to do something genuinely new? Aside from Pixar, which still has very niche content, I can't remember the last time Disney did an actually new story. 

It's one of the reasons this obsession people on here have with D+ ""killing"" Netflix is so silly."
Hidden Worlds,Well original content in this context means content that is developed specificity for the platform and is owned by Disney
Hidden Worlds,"
>Daredevil was hinted at strongly for SheHulk...

That doesn't excite me...  I don't see Daredevil remaining dark and gritty if placed in She-Hulk.  SH over the years has been more of a fun loving character."
Hidden Worlds,"It's going to be interesting to see how Tim Roth plays his take on Mark Ruffalo.

Hidden Worlds,"It's a Disney property.

They a announced it today, as well.

It actually appears on traditional broadcast television, anyone who can't see this **IS A SAVAGE AND AN IDIOT**.

Stoked about almost all of these, though."
Hidden Worlds,Most of these projects are planned before the COVID
Hidden Worlds,Different services provide different content. I dont see why that's only an issue when it's Disney. How much Oscar winning animated content do we see on HBO or Netflix?
Hidden Worlds,Duh.  If you want Disney's adult content you mosey over to Hulu.  If you've been looking at the end of the year critics' lists you'll have noticed Disney is beating Netflix and Warnerbrothers decisively when it comes to critical acclaim.
Hidden Worlds,Disney doesn’t give a fuck about that. They care about commercial success of which they aren’t matched.
Hidden Worlds,The show is listed as a comedy. Not sure how Charlie's Matt Murdock would fit into that.
Hidden Worlds,"I get it. But AntMan seemed really dumb to me. So did Thor at the time, and GotG is when I thought they had given up. 

I think the Series will be used to set up bigger events in the movies.  Almost like a Rogue One to Star Wars.  

That way people who want more background will have it, and yet you don’t HAVE to have seen it to follow the movies.  

Also Ironheart, Kate Bishop, Ms Marvel and I’m betting a Young Loki will get set up for a Secret Avengers movie."
Hidden Worlds,"Armor Wars is widely considered one of the best, if not the best period, Iron Man stories.

We’ll most likely see Justin Hammer return and the intro of some other big Iron Man villains like Crimson Dynamo.

I wouldn’t call it bottom of the barrel. The only difference is that War Machine will he finally getting the spotlight rather than Iron Man"
Hidden Worlds,"Well, you have to remember, when they first started making Marvel movies, Iron Man was a very odd choice in how to begin."
Hidden Worlds,Yes.  Can they only make outer space/superhero stuff?  That’s not the only genre.
Hidden Worlds,"Hi Lennie, you know what it is."
Hidden Worlds,After knocking it out of the park being Lord shaxx (your 7th column yelling still makes me smile) would there be any other video games you’d like to do voice work for?
Hidden Worlds,"Ok, that's it from me. I have to go walk my dog!  
Thank you all so much for stopping by and answering questions. It was a lot of fun.

Please watch Save Me and Save Me Too streaming now on Peacock.

Cheers

Hidden Worlds,Hey Lennie! Do you know the future of Morgan in the TWD Universe?
Hidden Worlds,Do you miss working on the walking dead?
Hidden Worlds,Hey Lennie? I hope you’ll visit Reddit more often. The Reddit community of Fear The Walking Dead is loving season 6 and a lot of people share their thoughts of season 6 and their favorite characters and stuff 🥰
Hidden Worlds,How long did it take you to master those moves with Morgan’s staff?
Hidden Worlds,Hi Lennie!
Hidden Worlds,Hi Lennie! Just wanted to say that I loved your characters in TWD and Line of Duty. Have there been any memorable moments from filming the new show? Excited to see your future projects!
Hidden Worlds,"I feel the Morgan/Rick storyline needs closure before TWD ends, do you agree?  They need one last scene on screen!"
Hidden Worlds,Hi Lennie! I'm curious to hear what you think of the new direction Morgan has taken in Fear The Walking Dead season 6 compared to where he was before. I'm really enjoying the new cowboy vibe. Hope we get to see some more lasso action!
Hidden Worlds,"Hi, Lennie! First of all, I’ve been a big fan since the Jericho days, now watching you in Fear The Walking Dead season 6. 

I know you directed Fear The Walking Dead’s second episode this season, ""Welcome to the Club"", what was the best part of directing an episode of the show? Would you like to do it again?"
Hidden Worlds,"Hey Lennie, I’ve always enjoyed your work.  Looking forward to more. 

What was the Blade Runner shoot like?  Love that flick btw."
The Perfect Match,I don’t know what this means; but I’m pretty sure I hate it.
The Perfect Match,“Stars”
The Perfect Match,I’ll give it a chance…seems like a rip off of Are You The One
The Perfect Match,"The end of Netflix as we know it? Once these companies turn to reality-tv, it seems to end their overall relevance.

See: TLC, History Channel, MTV, A&E, etc."
The Perfect Match,"So shock of netflix shoving trashy ""Dating"" shows down our throat 

They even tried to make the Circle a dating show"
The Perfect Match,"You are vastly underestimating the popularity of these shows. People sub to Netflix just to watch them and they're cheap to make, it's a cash cow. My girlfriend and her friends are absolute addicts to this type of TV. Outside of premiere weekly television like HoTD and maybe now TLoU, these types of shows are easily the last stand of ""watercooler talk"" television. 

Plus, Netflix released their 2023 catalogue yesterday, only on Reddit after looking at their list would you think they are in any sort of trouble lol."
The Perfect Match,HBO Max is pivoting to more reality shows as well
The Perfect Match,">They even tried to make the Circle a dating show

I mean, not really. This season was ""singles only"" but it's not like they changed the point of the game to be finding love. Plus most of the catfish weren't actually single anyway."
The Perfect Match,"They made a point to call it ""the Circle: SINGLES"" 
Seems like they were meaning for it to go a dating avenue."
The Perfect Match,“Tim burtons witty Adam’s family spin off is perfect” somehow equates to 4/5 stars
The Perfect Match,"I enjoyed it for what it was but I’m a lil disappointed for the things that it wasn’t that I’d have liked. Jenna was great as Wednesday, I enjoyed Enid and their friendship >!and even with the pure CGI cheesiness, when Enid wolfed out and protected Wednesday and gave her a smile, I got choked up!!<

Absolutely not sold on the casting for Mortica and Gomez tho, didn’t mind it at all when I first watched the trailer but felt like they had 0 chemistry in the show. The young versions felt like they had wayyyy more believable chemistry to me tbh"
The Perfect Match,i really liked it. it kinda gave me a series of unfortunate events vibes. it was a bit weird she was put in a school for the supernatural tho. the whole thing about the addams is they stick out like a sore thumb amongst the regular people. they had to make all the supernaturals super tame in order to make wednesday appear more standoffish
The Perfect Match,"Visually it looks great. Actually really great for a Netflix show.

Script I think struggles somewhat. Too much forced on the main character. Imagine if Buffy The Vampire Slayer was written where she told the only jokes, had every plan, all tragedy was about her... etc... it could do with way more narrative balance in the writing."
The Perfect Match,Did we watch the same show? It feels more akin to Sabrina than Addams Family
The Perfect Match,"My Mom has been sick with cancer for a long time and was a huge Addams family fan, she loved watching the old show on Pluto. Unfortunately, due to stupidity at the hospital she passed away last night at 53. I was looking forward to seeing this show with her. I was going to play it for us during Halloween but then was baffled that they released it for November and not October.

&#x200B;

Fuck cancer and fuck the doctors who make things worse."
The Perfect Match,"Worst writing ever -- preschool level, truly. Gomez is all wrong and I am not talking about his looks. 

I am not among those who believe Tim Burton's recent works are bad. I am still rather a fan. That said, this sucks. 

Nothing can save scripts that are this dreadful. Amateurs and fan-fic writers could do better."
The Perfect Match,"Jenny Ortega and Emma Myers were the two standouts on this show. Possibly because they were the only two who had fleshed out characters, while everyone else was just... there. Honestly could have made a show with just these two as Wednesday and Enid. 

But I can't say I thought much of the rest of casting. Catherine Zeta Jones wasn't a good choice for Morticia, nor was Louis Guizman for Gomez. It felt like they were there for their fame rather than suitability for the role. Fred Armisen was OK I guess, but having seen what Christopher Lloyd did with the role previously, the bar was pretty high.

The writing wasn't the best. Side plots that went nowhere, characters that seemed to act a certain way because it was necessary to the story, rather than any motivations they may have had. Not so subtle misdirects, shoehorned in teen romance and melodrama (seriously, does netflix have some contract stipulation that demands this?). Wednesday actually used the term 'mansplaining', which seemed weird and out of character.


Don't let my negative comments dissuade you if you're planning on watching though, it's still quite enjoyable despite it's flaws."
The Perfect Match,"could have been great if they kept her among ""normal people"". In Hogwarts? Meh, goes against the purpose of the Addams family"
The Perfect Match,Jenna Ortega is just so fantastic in the role.  The only other person who could do it better is the OG Christina Ricci.
The Perfect Match,It's enjoyable and Jenna is fantastic but the love triangle subplot is kind of too much like i dont care AT ALL i cant even remember all those boys' name
The Perfect Match,"Hmmm, I kinda felt like it was a bit too by-the-numbers didn't really trust it's audience enough and not really the level of wit necessary to really carry a deadpan off-kilter character like Wednesday. 



It just seemed really middle-of-the-road to me. But it's probably just not for me though I only watched two episodes. 

Plus the central conceit of the Addams family is a family that is healthy and cares about one another but with the macabre aesthetic that satirizes the idealized imagery of the middle American wholesome family. The heart and the  satire didn't seem there in Wednesday."
The Perfect Match,"This show was not good, not bad, a lot of cliche and only tangentially ""addams family"". Fester was a treat but we only got him for 1 episode."
The Perfect Match,"Felt mostly as Sabrina with a dash of Harry Potter.      

Incredible hard to stand any character in the tv show so id rate this much lower their either Sabrina or Harry Potter which had likeable characters."
The Perfect Match,"Loved Jenna Ortega as Wednesday 🫶🏻, but the plot was predictable mainly who Laurel and the Hyde where, I had my suspicions from the beginning but Episode 6 made me sure of them."
The Perfect Match,Just saw an episode on the second and it feels like those scooby doo specials. Where shaggy and scooby and sometimes scrappy are teachers at a school with little monsters.
The Perfect Match,"watching it,  fairly okey, colour grading is exellent (so many series/movies likes to overdue it with too much vfx these days, so i love higher quality visuals,  even if that just means colour, lighting, and cinematography)

i kind of like the charactors,  bit of a fan of the whole gothic, supernatural, hex stuff shows

little bit too cheesey the matalica instrumentals (westworld did that,  i guess they dont think there will be much overlap)

tiny bit on the boring slow burn though, and not enough addams family."
The Perfect Match,I once loved Burton but he keeps screwing up stuff since a couple of years now. I think he got abut everything wrong what made the Addams great.
The Perfect Match,"Currently watching the first episode.

It's so incredibly bland. It looks like any other Netflix YA show.  
So much for ""Directed by Tim Burton"" (but let's be real, that hasn't meant anything for a long time).  
It's also written like any other Netflix YA show, so, y'know, terribly.  
The younger actors are Netflix grade as well, with the exception of Jenna Ortega, although her Wednesday is a lot more grumpy and angry than Christina Ricci's, who was generally more indifferent about everything, and just did her thing.

It also leaves out one of the things that makes the Addams Family so compelling, which is that they're not bothered by anyone or anything. They don't view themselves as outcasts. They're weird and strange and entirely unusual to us, but to themselves they're a perfectly normal, loving family with regular interests and lives.    
Which makes the premise of the show inherently antithetical to these characters."
The Perfect Match,"I enjoyed it. It's a fun show, and I was pleasantly surprised by the supernatural elements. People need to learn to just relax and have fun watching stuff occasionally."
The Perfect Match,"This show is worth watching based on Jenny Ortega alone. She is really, really good as Wednesday. Nice to see a remarkable performance by such a young actor.

Gwendoline Christie is also very good.

The way they work in bits from the original show is fun. When one of the students said “You rang?” for instance."
The Perfect Match,Sucks that there's nothing left of old good classical Addams. It's like a cheap mixture of hogwarts and twilight.
The Perfect Match,"My opinions as someone that has watched it till the end. What saves the show is Tim Burton. It's a Hogwart's insert old canon here to bring followers in.  The writers missed several valid character personality traits that are there in all of the previous works.

1. Gomez never kisses and calls Morticia cara mia.  This is something that is in all platforms.  She spoke french, he never did act of affection which is jarring to others in public is always a comedic moment and a cute one.
2. Behind all the illusions that Wednesday is different than the rest, it's a farce. She's just a punk version of your moody average rebellious teenager. This is not the Wednesday's persona of any of her classic canons.  Just two of a longer list of examples:
   1. Would Wednesday block her parents from kissing?  All kids and teens are embarrassed and dislike their parents showing affection. That's a normal and by the way a puritanical point of view. Being raised by Gomez that is Mexican/Spanish heritage, this would be seen as perfectly normal in the Addams household.  Why then does she always make these snide comments to her parents?
   2. Would Wednesday rebel against being her mother?  This is a trope in all AMERICAN by the way because this is an American stereotypical concept writing strategy (Comes from English lit). Unlike the Germanic, Grimms version where the woman fears the child taking her place (Snow White).  American kids are always portrayed as wanting to be different, to outgrow, to be the opposite of their parents. Why would Wednesday, being in a welcoming albeit odd family, which harbors a different culture to the outside world be the same as her counterparts and be in a constant competition with her mother? Oh wait, because it's a Smallville writer so Wednesday's inner conflict is quite similar to regular humans, and this is one of my biggest pet-peeves with this show.
   3. Furthermore, if you were to actually have the original comic strips, have watched the older show (I'm in my 30s but I absolutely am a fan of the works), and the films that have followed Wednesday's rebellion to her family would have been more in canon had she decided she wanted to wear color. At which her family would have sent her to Nevermore because the odd folks were getting to their daughter (and it would be a funnier way of introducing her into realizing normal is not all). She would have been more like werewolfy.  Remember, to the Addams Family they were completely normal, so what would be the opposite of that? For her to rebel and go for that.

That being said, if you just want to see a variation of non-canonical Addams being marketed and used for Netflix revenue. Sure!  Watch the show. It is fun. It's just not the original source material, and reminds me of Smallville, Hogwarts, and Sabrina all into one.  I just don't believe every US show should have the stereotypical writing patterns.

Also, Gomez original fortune was blue-blood in Europe.  And though he was a bumbling idiot at times, he had the luck of the Irish as they'd state and he was always good in financial matters. In fact, I remember him betting in the stock market.

And by the way,  the Addams Family is a commentary about racism in the country. They represent a minority that thinks they are completely normal, and wants to a get along with white people but without conflict.  And as regular Americans find out about them and get to know them, they loose their fear on them.  This comment of them going to an outkasts school and segregating themselves. Is rather ODD. And as a minority myself, that is a metaphor that I do not like.  It would have been better had she realized she preferred normal school but with her own personality."
The Perfect Match,"I binge watched the whole show in one night. I liked the friendship relationship between Wednesday and Enid. I thought the plot was fast paced enough to be interesting, while still following the original mystery set up in the first episode.
It reminded me a lot of Sabrina, which I also really liked the first season but felt the later seasons lacked plot wise. 
There are definitely a lot of high school cliches, like a love triangle, high school dance, and mean girl vibes. But I didn’t think these cliches took the overall show down too much. Also the plot twists were very predictable, I was hoping for a better surprise when they revealed the big bad guy"
The Perfect Match,"I binged it and I thoroughly enjoyed it.  I agree with this article, although ""perfect"" is a bit of hyperbole.  Can't wait for season 2!   Also didn't realize Christina Ricci was in the show the whole time until after lol."
The Perfect Match,"I think it's a pretty decent show. My huge complaint is casting choice for Gomez and Morticia. Luis Guzman is NOT Gomez, he's creepy and not charming at all. The young Gomez they had playing was more accurate than what they casted. Kzj is alright for Morticia but she's too ""smiley"" and not stone face/subtle smirk with sarcasm like any other actor who's played Morticia. Heck, even Charlize Theron voicing her in the animated movies is WAY better than KZJ acting as her in Live action. All in all, it's a new take on things for sure. Could've done better casting tho."
The Perfect Match,Christina Ricci is a National Treasure!!!
The Perfect Match,"I really enjoyed this show. I think the direction they’re going in is good. It would have been boring to be another Addams Family show…eventually, had they not changed as much as they have. So I’m cool with it"
The Perfect Match,Watched 3 episodes last night with my family.  Can’t wait to keep going after work tonight.  Thoroughly enjoyed by all!
The Perfect Match,"I couldnt get through the first episode, I felt like the target audience is for teenagers based on the dialogue and just couldnt get into it. Does it get better after the first episode?"
The Perfect Match,This show is really not as bad as a lot of complaints here. Smh I have 3 episodes left and I’ve been enjoying it. I won’t nitpick over the details like everyone else when I can just enjoy the show as a whole. I don’t need the show to be a 100% redo of every other Addams Family lore. Y’all are extra
The Perfect Match,"

About casting I don't mind Netflix Gomez looks but this character lack charisma.

Morticia is ok but lack interaction with Gomez.

Pugsley is now officially a mob( side character in the background). He even got bullied to the point Wednesday avenge for him. Pugsley should have fun while being bullied

Wednesday cast is ok. In short this is gloomy goth Sabrina. I don't know why they obsessed with vision/prophecy. She doesn't need to be the chosen one to make her unique. Being Addams already unique.

My opinion they can even make cheerful Wednesday like cartoon network (kid Wednesday with weird toy). But to make her chosen one and give vision ability. Wow so unique and creative if not 50 teen supernatural highschools haven't done it before.

But it doesn't mean you shouldn't watch. It's good to watch but don't expect ""Addams"" much in it."
The Perfect Match,"Show is Okay, but the plot though... Couldnt be more obvious"
The Perfect Match,Eh kinda disappointed. This was like a watered down version of the movie characters. Wednesday has too many up and down inflections in her speaking. She should be monotone.
The Perfect Match,"I'm still waiting it, but it's too Harry Pottery for me"
The Perfect Match,"I just finished the show, and I agree with a lot of the comments here. In spite of its glaring issues, the show is still enjoyable. Still, it's disappointing that it fails to rise above just being 'enjoyable'. 

I tried to keep an open mind while watching it, knowing that it wouldn't be what I was expecting of hoping it would be. I'm not the type of person to enjoy grandiose plots, so I knew I'd have to step out of my comfort-zone with this one.

  
I think everything that can be said about the casting has been said already:

  
**Jenna Ortega** was a great pick for Wednesday and pulled off the role as well as I believe is possible for someone who is not Christina Ricci or (the popular fan-cast) Aubrey Plaza. 

**Catherine Zeta-Jones**, as iconic as she is as an actress, was horribly miscast in my opinion. It's hard to follow Anjelica Huston in the live-action role, and I'm afraid this attempt fell completely flat for me. It's hard to put into words exactly what was missing—it all just felt so off. There was none of the poise or elegance I expected of Morticia, and the earnest playfulness was missing too. It was just off. 

Same goes for **Luis Guzmán**. I simply couldn't wrap my head around how Morticia could have fallen for this iteration of Gomez. They're supposed to be seen as deeply in love and eternally lusting for each other, but every time these two touched, I cringed. 

I have nothing against **Hunter Doohan** in the role of Tyler Galpin. His look and demeanour strangely reminded me of Paul Dano as Riddler in the newest Batman film... or just Paul Dano in general. Thanks to this association, I just assumed he was not to be trusted from the start. 

&#x200B;

  
The script could have used just one more revision. There were side-plots that went nowhere, the mystery was simultaneously convoluted and far too easy to figure out from the early episodes, and my personal pet peeve, which was the love triangle. I should also mention the hyped-up villain, Crackstone, whose final scene was a bit of a let-down. 

'Chosen-one' plots have been done to death. *""The main character, who is very unique and special, is the centre of a prophecy...""* aha aha yes very cool and very unique, I definitely am not bored to death. 

Concerning the climax of the final episode—>!the lead-up and following fight against Crackstone: how many times are characters (mostly Wednesday) going to just stand in front of a villain motionless, waiting to get hit? Let's not even talk about Wednesday turning her back to a villain right after said villain murked someone right in front of her. !<

This is a personal nitpick, but Wednesday Addams becoming romantically involved with a 'normie' (whether insinuated or directly stated) has been around for a while (think Joel Glicker in Addams Family Values, or Lucas Beineke in the musical) and I'm bored of it. 

&#x200B;

My review might sound a tad bit severe so far. To balance out the negative comments I have, I'd like to mention things that I liked: 

\- Wednesday's character development: it felt believable and not too far-fetched to me. It happened slowly enough, and for good reasons. 

\- The friendships forged: although some plots were dropped *(\*cough cough\* Bianca)*, the friendships and alliances within the show were still fun to see play out. I especially liked it when Wednesday's reckless endangerment of her friends was called out, and when Enid decided to get some distance. 

\- Art direction: the sets, costumes, character designs, &c. were a treat for the eyes. The aesthetics matched the story and the vibe. Whether I was fully on-board with the story and vibe is a different thing.

\- Hilarious monster design and CGI: I don't believe it was intended to make me cackle, but the monster design and 2000s-esque CGI made me laugh. It reminded me of the Scooby Doo (2002). Very enjoyable.

I have more to say, but this post is long enough. Also my McBrain isn't McWorking anymore because it's 1:40 AM and I am dead tired. 

I liked the show, but I doubt I'll re-watch it anytime soon. 

thank you for coming to my TED Talk o7"
The Perfect Match,"> and has a lead who more than matches Christina Ricci

You have just made a powerful enemy, kind redditor."
The Perfect Match,The fencing scene! Visual and choreography joy. Wish it was longer.
The Perfect Match,"I loved it!! Just finished at 01am on Thanksgiving night. I watched the whole damn thing before reading that Christina Ricci plays Miss Thornhill. She totally got me, I had no freaking idea"
The Perfect Match,I watched it all in one sitting. I throughly enjoyed it and I’m not getting as many mixed feelings as most people apparently. I liked this iteration or the character Wednesday and I was very much invested it. While it had predictable moments They still were done in a way that I felt paid off. The only thing that bothers me was Gomez and morticia. They didn’t feel like a part of it and didn’t fit the role well.
The Perfect Match,"After the ep 1 cello scene, I was hooked.
I was so glad that we weren't forced into watching many scenes with the gomez character, yuck.
I was really thrilled that the show focused very little on the vampire, werewolf, sirens and wizard characters...most modern shows in this venue give way too much screentime for that - but Burton did Wednesday extremly well."
The Perfect Match,It would be ashame if they don’t continue with Wednesday…it was fun..held our  attention and the writers were superb in keeping us guessing who the Hyde was..Casting was excellent and deserves 5 stars!
The Perfect Match,"Not really a fan. Like, I get it, Wednesday is a bitch. Her character is exhausting honestly. No real depth. At least Christina Ricci had some personality and an odd charm. I understand that she’s not meant to be likeable but she really has no redeemable qualities in this adaptation. Too robotic and pretentious. Oh, and she knows Kung Fu now? It’s cringe even for a teen show."
The Perfect Match,"There’s some things i like, but overall it feels like the goth MarySue version of Wednesday Addams."
The Perfect Match,"Curse me all you want, but sorry, the choice of Luiz Guzman as Gomez just ruined the series for me. ""Yeah Yeah, that's how he's in the comics"". But that that's not how we portray him in the movies.  
I stopped watching it because I couldn't withstand it. So ridiculous. So much miss our Raul Julia. They could've cast a more prominent actor."
The Perfect Match,"The show is good, but the script is really bad occasionally where I had to pause and laugh. The music choice occasionally was weird too, why would anyone use TikTok music for an actual show?"
The Perfect Match,They butchered Gomez. The relationship with Morticia is way off. Dropping Wednesday into Monster High isn’t really all that clever and if you’re gonna show me the monster in the first episode spend some goddamn money and at least make sure the lighting matches the rest of the scene. I think it’s a miss.
The Perfect Match,"I found it puerile and under dramatized, lacking structure, character or any sense of the Aristotelian Unities."
The Perfect Match,I'm one and a half episodes in and liking it so far.
The Perfect Match,"It's nice, typical boarding school ya fantasy mystery, really cheesy, but I enjoy cheesy. I think I would have liked it better if it was about original characters and not the addams family because then it completely misunderstands the whole point of the family and Wednesday's character. Just a dark goth girl inspired by Wednesday instead of actually using Wednesday addams would have made this show better appreciated I think because otherwise it just doesn't meet any expectations."
The Perfect Match,"I think they got the casting pretty great. But I have issues with it, Wednesday comes off as a manic pixie girl with all the guys that randomly try and hit her up, in a school of magic and fantasy she is less special (the entire point is supposed to be the Addams being odd and ostracized, but they sort of fit in here ..) and the weird Morticia and Wednesday drama. They're meant to be a loving family despite the macabre nature."
The Perfect Match,Tim Burton knows how to make a series with the right amount twist that makes this show a fantastic series. In my opinion I give it 4/5 ⭐ and hope that they renew for a second season plz
The Perfect Match,"Gotten through one episode. Great cast wasted by bad writing. And Luis is kind of off as Gomez. He physically resembles the comic Gomez but lacks the panache of Astin and Raul Julia. His line readings aren’t smooth at all. The bullshit Hogwarts is just lame.

Ortega and Zeta-Jones are excellent."
The Perfect Match,I hate it she's so cringee
The Perfect Match,It's like Andor for goths
The Perfect Match,"If you told me years ago when Addams Family film came out that they would eventually make a show like this, I would've said you were crazy. The trailer looks pretty interesting though"
The Perfect Match,"Amazing writing and story! Some of the acting is off here and there. But, overall really a great story, a nice new perspective."
The Perfect Match,Loved it. Love the new WA.
The Perfect Match,"I've enjoyed it, Gomez has let himself go a bit though"
The Perfect Match,Only seen the first episode so it’s fine but I must the stand out scene for me is paint it black on the cello
The Perfect Match,Just watched the first episode. The word perfect really fits. I have 0 complaints.
The Perfect Match,"If you have to put down one actress to try to build up another, well, that says a lot. None of it good.

Everything I've seen about this indicates that Burton doesn't grasp the central conceit of the characters. They are supposed to be the only weird things in their surroundings. The Addams' don't work if they live in Halloween town. Wednesday doesn't work if she she doesn't go too far, even in the context of the narrative."
The Perfect Match,"'writer' starts a sentence and a paragraph with...'So,...'what editor is letting this go?  'writers' in america have went downhill..."
The Perfect Match,"I really don't like what I've seen from the trailer. The whole reason Wednesday gets expelled from school is pretty damn sexist/misandrist. 

The whole deal with the Adams Family was that mostly, they just were odd, and scared people. If something bad happened it wasn't shown, it was implied. Shit, even in Adams Family values Amanda is shown after being roasted on the spit to be OK and unharmed.

Imagine if you reversed the sexes and had Pugsley be expelled for a similar reason to Wednesday.... 

Also the whole idea of putting them in a school for outcasts eliminates one of the best draws of the Adams Family - the contrast with your average person.

________

-edit - watch this and tell me how it would go if it were Pugsley: https://youtu.be/Di310WS8zLk?t=49"
The Perfect Match,"While I did not mind the first episode, only watched the first so far, but my first thought was oh, lets redo legacies. 

Mind you, kind of thinking Ortega and Kaylee Bryant may have been an interesting duo"
The Perfect Match,"I have only watched two eps so far but am liking it overall. I really love the cast and I think Jenna Ortega is complete perfection as Wednesday (worth watching for her portrayal alone), but the Hogwarts/amateur sleuth concept was played out in the 2000s

If they were going to do a small town high school drama/murder mystery I think I probably would've preferred if she'd stayed at her original normie school. I feel like there would be a lot more to work with if Wednesday was among normal people rather than like... mermaids and werewolves and shit"
The Perfect Match,Rip off of Harry Potter
The Perfect Match,I have this hope and theory that Ms. Marylin Thornhill has a direct relation to Cheryl Blossom of Thornhill in Riverdale!!! Remember Cheryl descended from withes and was a witch herself so my theory/hope fits.
The Perfect Match,I've seen a LOT of fanart of this series over the past month and I'm confused cos I thought it was only released this week.
The Perfect Match,Adams Family meets Harry Potter.
The Perfect Match,"So I’m confused, if Xavier is the one who gave her the phone then he’s the only one with the number right? Which would make him the stalker?"
The Perfect Match,"Imo it doesn't really feel like Adam's Family, way less macabre than the others.

If you watch it from the perspective of another ""supernatural school"" or ""whodunnit"" series it's probably more enjoyable compared to that genre."
The Perfect Match,"Tyler needs a redemption. I know everyone is like “xavier and wednesday” or “enid and Wednesday”. but the chemistry between Tyler and Wednesday was amazing. Tyler truly loved her, but he got groomed, muliptiated (can’t spell that) hopefully he can slowly control his hyde, saying that i don’t know if he can, but he NEEDS a redemption."
The Perfect Match,"Wednesday- it’s stylish, colors contrast well and the setting is just perfect enough (typical New England for Goth 101). The tone of the show is well balanced where Wednesday does her part to stay the course of darkness even when she wants to break momentarily. I don’t know how to feel about the whole murder mystery. It’s such a staple of young adult shows and then to incorporate into the Addams Family? It doesn’t sit right. I chuckled in the first episode when Wednesday went to Nevermore, because of course, like a good YA show on the CW- let’s create this hidden and more-to-the-eye supernatural school where Wednesday is supposed to be this fit and the most popular person. Which I question- how is a sociopath/psychopath on the same level as a werewolf, vampire, gorgon, faceless person, shapeshifter, a guy who can make his art come to life, someone who controls bees and insects, and a twisted Harry Potter? I can understand the first couple of weeks being the new flavor of the month, but she’s closer to being a “normie”, if not just a actual normal person, than being of them. Burton and co. HAD to throw in the twist of “psychic visions” because I’m sure they wrestled with this logic as well and needed to figure out what could make her distinguishable but even then, cool.. That’s so Rave’n! 

I really like some of the supporting characters, but I’d like to see them fleshed out more. Enid is a great counterbalance to Wednesday! I love Gomez and Morticia!! Great casting and they hit it on the head. I’d like to see Wednesday not be the typical teen and actually get along with her mother, but maybe that’s the point in that she is actually more “normal” than she’d like to admit, such as the teen angst. If they do a season 2, which even then where does this go, I’d like the brother to be at the school because why shouldn’t he be??! And the family more incorporated. 

Overall a 6/10. I believe that if Nevermore was just a ultra rich academy with normal kids, or maybe they just fit the stereotype of how we see wealth in this country and are coldhearted and narcissistic, then I think this could be even creepier because they have to deal with a Wednesday Adams being who she is, but when they are super natural it just feels like those are the more interesting characters for some reason. This show shouldn’t have to justify Wednesday Addams as a person, the whole point of the Addams family was that they were the opposite of the typical American family."
The Perfect Match,"Writing this as someone who's never really watched the originals.  
  
I love the detective angle they went with, but the writing was kinda everywhere. I didn't really care for most of the other characters except for Wednesday, the thing, and Enid. I don't remember anyone else's name if I'm being honest.  
  
The sheriff seemed like he could be interesting, but we didn't exactly get to spend much time with a character before we jumped to another new one. So I hope for season 2 that all the existing characters will get fleshed out a bit more.   
  
Overall I'd give it a 9/10 because I enjoyed it a lot."
The Perfect Match,"I liked the show overall. It certainly has issues, that's for sure. Things set up and never explained, questionable casting and so on, but overall it was enjoyable. The one thing that continues.to bother me though, and I hope someone can answer because Google doesn't seem to have one.. Big spoilers for the last episode btw.  >!Why is Crackstone resurrected with a magical staff? How does he know how to use it? Surely he's against such things? And shouldn't he be killing the person that resurrected him, because, witchcraft and sorcery.!<"
The Perfect Match,I used to think
The Perfect Match,"I really enjoyed the show. I thought the bad guys were pretty obvious from the start and there were some overused tropes and lines in there. But still very enjoyable and I will definitely watch more, its right up my alley. 

What I didn't get was why >!did Crackstone at the end have magical powers and came with a magical staff if his whole thing was hating outcasts and not being one.!< That thoroughly confused me."
The Perfect Match,Looks like a high school kid show… not sure i should even check it out
The Perfect Match,So cheesy and childish... I wanted dark and gritty
The Perfect Match,"I watched the first 10 minutes and turned it off….how is Pugsley getting bullied he’s an Addams…the new show made him a bitch and I was like do I want to waste my time giving this a try, after reading the reviews n comments I’ll pass on this series🥲"
The Perfect Match,"The comedy was just not dark enough for me and just a bit basic felt like I was being spoon-fed.
This might not make sense but I think that the show Fraiser was really good. Clever writing and comedy."
The Perfect Match,"I was REALLY enjoying it till, some stuff happened at the end of the third episode, just stupid coincidences without any explanation ou sense..."
The Perfect Match,Not a fan of the new Wednesday 😑
The Perfect Match,Goo Goo Muck by The Cramps...classic
The Perfect Match,Pugsly feels like a sad broken toy. What meds do they have him on?
The Perfect Match,"Whereas Ricci's Wednesday was a mostly impartial, dark stoic, Ortega's Wednesday is an insufferable snob who is guilty of everything she accuses others of being, especially an elitist. And the characters surrounding Ortega's Wednesday are aware of her personality, but they love her. And fans of the show also praise Ortega's performance/interpretation. I feel like the only person who despises such a character, so I have to conclude that I'm the asshole."
The Perfect Match,"   I think my biggest issue with the show was the writing for Gomez and Morticia, even Pugsley to a lesser extent.     They have these defined world building traits that make them odd, talented, prestigious and that shows when convenient for the story, but then they are reduced to fairly normal, overwhelmed people in next scene waiting for Wednesday to solve their problems for them.  Admittedly it suffers by comparison to Anjelica Huston and Raul Julia for me.   >!For example the sword fight,  if you think about Raul Julia's character you feel like Gomez would have been thrilled to fight to the death for Morticia to attest his love for her.  As opposed to being so frantic and taken aback by it like he was.!<  


They felt very cardboard and there to accessorize Wednesday with typical parents in the guise of seeming odd and non-traditional, but really hitting on a lot of the normal parent troupes.   I know they were never meant to drive the story as characters, it being Wednesday's show and all, but they just seemed so uninteresting when they were on screen.   I agree, a lot of people mentioned it, chemistry felt like an issue, but the writing for them felt uninspiring too.   


I still liked the show.    Actually would have enjoyed seeing even less of the rest of the Addams Family because I feel like they didn't add much at all."
The Perfect Match,"A 10/10 show if you want to watch casually!

Though it was a little cheesy to create a supernatural school setting, in order to produce a mystery/kind of detective show. Not to mention with the love triangle..

If the Addams Family, especially Wednesday, gets to have better dialogues (script) for Season 2, I might love it even more"
The Perfect Match,I don't get what they did to Pugsly.  Sure he was never portrayed as smart but he's not supposed to be this emotional wimp.  He's supposed to be almost as dark as Wednesday in terms of enjoying morbid and deadly things.  He's supposed to have a sibling rivalry with Wednesday where they're constantly trying to kill each other.  Instead he's just a normal wimpy kid trying to hug his sister...anyway that's really the main thing that bugged me in the first episode that I've watched so far.  I know Gomez is supposed to be like his 1930's comic book self before he was even actually called Gomez but I don't really like him in this show either.  Wednesday herself is pretty great though.
The Perfect Match,"I got a C+ on my first English 101 essay. The professor had office hours and said anyone could come in and discuss how improvements so I did. She had no suggestions. “It was a great paper, a great C+ paper.” I bet she’d give a perfect show three out of five stars."
Conversations with a Killer: The Ted Bundy Tapes,The fascination with serial killer documentaries are awesome for serial killers to learn how to avoid getting caught.
Conversations with a Killer: The Ted Bundy Tapes,"Like how watching the news shows you have to avoid getting caught for crimes? Or like watching movies shows you how to avoid getting caught? Or like how playing video games shows you how to kill people and avoid getting caught? You’re a dipshit, but Hitman 2 is damn fun"
Conversations with a Killer: The Ted Bundy Tapes,k
Conversations with a Killer: The Ted Bundy Tapes,The first episode of this was an extremely dull watch somehow.
Conversations with a Killer: The Ted Bundy Tapes,He is such a creep! 
Conversations with a Killer: The Ted Bundy Tapes,People are only giving Ted Bundy shit because hes hot and they're jealous.
Conversations with a Killer: The Ted Bundy Tapes,I’m watching EP 1 right now...  does it pick up?  It’s pretty dull so far 
Conversations with a Killer: The Ted Bundy Tapes,He was ugly 
Conversations with a Killer: The Ted Bundy Tapes,"Yeah, nothing to do with the 30+ people he murdered...."
Conversations with a Killer: The Ted Bundy Tapes,Yeah like get over it he’s hot and famous and they so jelly
Conversations with a Killer: The Ted Bundy Tapes,Couldn't tell you I bailed after episode 1
Conversations with a Killer: The Ted Bundy Tapes,"The Ted Bundy and John Wayne episodes were really interesting, I'm looking forward to it."
Conversations with a Killer: The Ted Bundy Tapes,Hasn't this been done a hundred times and aren't his interviews online everywhere?
Conversations with a Killer: The Ted Bundy Tapes,"He did an interview with 60 minutes I think. The dude did not hide or lie about everything he did. In fact, I believe he was telling his story after he was first arrested and the cop didn’t believe him until he kept getting calls from the crime scene people about all the severed dicks and body parts they kept finding in the apartment."
Conversations with a Killer: The Ted Bundy Tapes,How many movies/series/documentaries does this dude have about himself? Do people really crave more Jeffrey Dahmer content?
Conversations with a Killer: The Ted Bundy Tapes,Oh man I love these on Netflix. The Ted Bundy one was so well produced. Gacy should’ve been another episode longer but still enjoyed it.
Conversations with a Killer: The Ted Bundy Tapes,Oh fuck yes! While I liked My Friend Dahmer and The Jeffrey Dahmer Files. I think this may be better.
Conversations with a Killer: The Ted Bundy Tapes,"Imagine this is your job, and the primary thing you are responsible for. And you pitch “how about more jeffrey dahmer content?”"
Conversations with a Killer: The Ted Bundy Tapes,"Unpopular opinion: These killers should not be glorified. The law enforcement that catches them should be glorified, and the killers should remain anonymous.

You can still make a compelling documentary going into life and psychology of the killer, all the gory details, just don’t name him."
Conversations with a Killer: The Ted Bundy Tapes,"I’ve been waiting for Netflix to do some Jeffery based, one of my ‘favourite’ serial killers, the story is interesting because of the socioeconomic implications why they never realized the victims were victims of a serial killer."
Conversations with a Killer: The Ted Bundy Tapes,"can we like… stop, with the serial killer obsession?"
Conversations with a Killer: The Ted Bundy Tapes,Worst lover I ever had
Conversations with a Killer: The Ted Bundy Tapes,People love this stuff and they'll watch it.

Conversations with a Killer: The Ted Bundy Tapes,Oh great more serial killer bullshit for women to masturbate to.
Conversations with a Killer: The Ted Bundy Tapes,Deifying mass murderers with numerous streaming specials. America.
Conversations with a Killer: The Ted Bundy Tapes,Fuck it. I think he's cute.
Conversations with a Killer: The Ted Bundy Tapes,"I’m not fan of serial killer lore.    I guess most people can listen to with complete objection,  it those aren’t the people I worry about."
Conversations with a Killer: The Ted Bundy Tapes,"Man that’s my cake day,, ruined by this butthead"
Conversations with a Killer: The Ted Bundy Tapes,I was disappointed with the Gacey tapes - it seemed to be more of a procedural catching a killer doc than a focus on the tapes.
Conversations with a Killer: The Ted Bundy Tapes,"You might like this [interview with the lead detective on the Dahmer case.](https://youtu.be/DZf3ywMmQaE)

It’s fascinating. They ask him how he felt when Dahmer was killed, and his answer is interesting."
Conversations with a Killer: The Ted Bundy Tapes,"Yeah, the Stone Phillips interview with Jeffrey and his father is probably the most famous serial killer interview there is"
Conversations with a Killer: The Ted Bundy Tapes,"No..no he didn't, Jeffrey Dahmer was killed in 1994."
Conversations with a Killer: The Ted Bundy Tapes,">Do people really crave more Jeffrey Dahmer content?

Not Dahmer specifically, but true crime in general"
Conversations with a Killer: The Ted Bundy Tapes,They crave it like how Jeffery craved human flesh
Conversations with a Killer: The Ted Bundy Tapes,You mean the same law enforcement that let a drugged up naked 14 year old boy go back into Dahmer’s home? And he was killed. Yeah let’s throw them a parade.
Conversations with a Killer: The Ted Bundy Tapes,'The law enforcement that catches them' doesn't give a shit about the groups targeted by serial killers and usually blows the very frequent chances they have to make an arrest before the list of victims grows. Why the hell should indifference and ineptitude be glorified?
Conversations with a Killer: The Ted Bundy Tapes,Why would you glorify the police in this case? Do you even know the Dahmer story? The police deserve no glory in this.
Conversations with a Killer: The Ted Bundy Tapes,"Agreed.

I struggle with this. I hate serial killer movies because the medium inherently glorifies the killers (as movies/TV do with main characters unless done in a very specific manner). But I enjoy reading about investigations and how they get caught. The only true crime documentaries I’ve seen that did a great job of not glamorizing were the Tower, and a doc that interviewed/focused on the victims of and Ted Bundys girlfriend. And to be honest they were so well done, with the latter being *far* more fascinating than anything else I’ve seen on Ted Buddy. Ted Bundt isn’t interesting. His girlfriend talking about how he was trying to tell her he had a compulsion that he couldn’t contain? fascinating

I wish more documentaries would do this. The tower focused on the survivors and victims of the Texas tower shooting, and I was so moved. There were some seriously courageous people who literally ran into the kind of fire to help those who were shot."
Conversations with a Killer: The Ted Bundy Tapes,No
Conversations with a Killer: The Ted Bundy Tapes,"It’s really telling that the most prolific serial killers in American history have targeted marginalized groups. Ridgeway, Kraft, Sowell, Dahmer…"
Conversations with a Killer: The Ted Bundy Tapes,It's interesting stuff. Don't watch it if you don't like it. There's nothing that glorifies the killers in series like these.
Conversations with a Killer: The Ted Bundy Tapes,"No , we are not"
Conversations with a Killer: The Ted Bundy Tapes,Jeff would prefer if the men were masturbating to this.
Conversations with a Killer: The Ted Bundy Tapes,Damn bro I know your life is ruined since Andrew Tate got banned but calm down.
Conversations with a Killer: The Ted Bundy Tapes,Bruh? You okay?
Conversations with a Killer: The Ted Bundy Tapes,What the fuck
Conversations with a Killer: The Ted Bundy Tapes,"I thought “Evil lives here”

Season 5 episode 1, did a better job. It shows the abuse he had as a child, and interviews from his sister/family."
Conversations with a Killer: The Ted Bundy Tapes,"Or infamous.

A lot of prisons stopped these interviews after this."
Conversations with a Killer: The Ted Bundy Tapes,"It may have been inside edition or NSMBC, I can’t recall which program but yes, he most certainly did."
Conversations with a Killer: The Ted Bundy Tapes,"Uh, you know 60 Minutes has been around since the ‘60s, right?"
Conversations with a Killer: The Ted Bundy Tapes,Why true crime now?
Conversations with a Killer: The Ted Bundy Tapes,"Yeah, I'd be much, much more interested in a documentary that focused on the not-insignificant role that systemic racism played in allowing Dahmer to get away with his crimes for so long (he lived in, and preyed on, an almost exclusively Black neighborhood, and there were a number of incidents - including the one, referenced above, involving the 14-year-old - in which Black people tried to tell the cops that he was violent, only to be met with apathy and/or contempt). It's an important angle, and one that I've rarely seen discussed in this case.

But of course there are vanishingly few true-crime docs that deal with police culpability in crimes like these, in large part because the documentarians usually want insider information on the case, and so end up having to suck up to the cops whether they really want to or not. (Nick Broomfield's Tales of the Grim Sleeper is one of the few I can think of that does *not* do this, eschewing the cops' perspective for that of the Black sex workers who were targeted, and it's far better for it.)"
Conversations with a Killer: The Ted Bundy Tapes,Isn’t the act of dedicating a television series to someone a form of glorification?
Conversations with a Killer: The Ted Bundy Tapes,oh wow not glorifying mass murderers?? how commendable
Conversations with a Killer: The Ted Bundy Tapes,"While lying down in a tray of olive oil, lemon juice, and soy sauce."
Conversations with a Killer: The Ted Bundy Tapes,">Stone Phillips interview with Jeffrey and his father

why?"
Conversations with a Killer: The Ted Bundy Tapes,"You aren't seemingly paying attention to the fact he is quite literally a corpse.

A quick Google search is all you need. He died on Nov 28, 1994."
Conversations with a Killer: The Ted Bundy Tapes,"But Marcus, I have to ask, why true crime now?"
Conversations with a Killer: The Ted Bundy Tapes,Hail yourself!
Conversations with a Killer: The Ted Bundy Tapes,"The lead detective talks about those two cops in this [interview.](https://youtu.be/DZf3ywMmQaE) I recommend it. 

Homophobia also played a huge part in why the kid was brought back to Dahmer. 

That documentary sounds interesting; where can I watch it?"
Conversations with a Killer: The Ted Bundy Tapes,"I loved tales of the grim sleeper. That ex prostitute lady totally made the documentary. If you’re into podcasts check out Unresolved. He often will mention how police indifference to marginalized groups played a major role(ex West Mesa bone collector victims were mainly Latina sex workers, so police didn’t give a shit. Still hasn’t been caught) His voice is a bit boring, so I personally prefer to read his transcripts at Unresolved.me He is very thorough and detailed in his work."
Conversations with a Killer: The Ted Bundy Tapes,Is a WW2 documentary glorifying Hitler and the Nazis? There’s a lot to be learned from evil men and the reasons they do the things they do.
Conversations with a Killer: The Ted Bundy Tapes,"No, not necessarily."
Conversations with a Killer: The Ted Bundy Tapes,How is that relevant
Conversations with a Killer: The Ted Bundy Tapes,">Homophobia also played a huge part in why the kid was brought back to Dahmer.

Oh, for sure, and I don't mean to minimize that at all; it's just that that aspect of the case has been discussed at least a bit (though probably not nearly as much as it should), whereas the racial aspects of it, AFAIK, never really are.

As for Tales of the Grim Sleeper - not sure (I'm not in the US), but I believe it's on Prime?"
Conversations with a Killer: The Ted Bundy Tapes,"Ohh, yes, I've heard of Unresolved! Just never got round to checking it out, and now I think I will. Thanks very much.

(And, if you've not listened to it already, you might like [The Fall Line](https://www.thefalllinepodcast.com/), a podcast that specializes in deep dives on cases that haven't received much media attention due primarily to the victims being members of marginalized groups - it's excellent.)"
Conversations with a Killer: The Ted Bundy Tapes,Tbf it's a bit more harder to replicate the Third Reich than it is to replicate a murderer
Conversations with a Killer: The Ted Bundy Tapes,"The other user stated they ""just saw him"" do an interview.  The point is no they didn't, Jeffery has been dead for 28 years."
Conversations with a Killer: The Ted Bundy Tapes,"Sure, but it’s not like these Netflix docs are inspiring a brand new breed of serial murderer. Those pathologies exist without the influence of entertainment media, and if I’m not mistaken, incidence of serial murders has been steady declining for decades. Anyway, my original point was that showcasing criminal behavior is not the same as glorifying criminal behavior. It’s not like everything turned out great for these guys, they’re not celebrities. They’re like carnival sideshows."
Conversations with a Killer: The Ted Bundy Tapes,You can't read
Conversations with a Killer: The Ted Bundy Tapes,"1) No they didn’t. Go brush up on your reading skills and reread the comments you replied to

2) the internet exists? Like you can literally watch 9/11 on YouTube and have literally just saw it without it having just happened. Recorded media doesn’t stop being accessible lol"
Conversations with a Killer: The Ted Bundy Tapes,"He probably saw this interview for the first time. As in he just saw it for the first time.

https://youtu.be/iWjYsxaBjBI"
Conversations with a Killer: The Ted Bundy Tapes,"I get your point, but it's all about bringing them to attention. The concept of copycat murders is pretty real."
Conversations with a Killer: The Ted Bundy Tapes,"Yes. Real, but fairly anomalous, and I would say if someone is gearing up to do some copycat Dahmer murders, that person was already dangerously unhinged and likely would have travelled that path regardless of the documentaries on Netflix.

Edit: there’s also something to be said for well-informed potential victims. If someone recognizes some behaviors or patterns in a person that they learned about from their travels in True Crime entertainment, it could be argued that’s a pretty solid advantage."
Conversations with a Killer: The Ted Bundy Tapes,"I saw his comment more as a justification of the sentence, not an indication that he is a fan. I think the judge is saying that he is unbiased (no animosity) and the sentence is what Ted deserves. It's such a waste because he had potential to do great things but did so, so many terrible things."
Conversations with a Killer: The Ted Bundy Tapes,"If ""a total waste of humanity"" is seen as high praise I guess my father was praising me all along..."
Conversations with a Killer: The Ted Bundy Tapes,"I thought the same at first, but then after thought I think it would almost be the worst thing I could here. “You had so much potential, yet you used it for evil instead of good. I wish you could be standing here in front of me for good instead.” 

That would be absolutely humiliating. "
Conversations with a Killer: The Ted Bundy Tapes,"I mean, that’s exactly the problem, the guy had like a fucking charm everybody kinda liked him, that’s why he was so damn good at killing. Even the judge felt compassion for him after all he did, those girls didn’t stand a chance when he was scheming to kill them. "
Conversations with a Killer: The Ted Bundy Tapes,"He did represent himself too and behaved quite convincingly in court as a real attorney. This, however, was his downfall. His sheer arrogance and confidence along with a complete lack of empathy for his victims was the behaviour of a psychopath. He was actually allowed to question survivors and I’m sure he relished every moment of reliving and replaying every crime that he believed he had got away with again and again. If it wasn’t for the sheer bravery of the surviving victims testimonies and the evidence which even he couldn’t wriggle out of (dental records from bites), I’m sure he would have convinced a jury of his supposed innocence. "
Conversations with a Killer: The Ted Bundy Tapes,"I had a friend from elementary through high school. One of the brightest and funniest kids I knew. So much potential, maybe too much. He could have applied himself and been anything he wanted to be. He started doing drugs at a young age and ended up doing hard drugs, stealing things, having sex with underage girls, just making horrible choices. He's in prison now. Has been for a while, will be for a while more. I understand the judges response. It's sad to see someone who could have just as easily been a huge asset and improvement to the world throw it all away for carnal impulse. Truly a waste of humanity indeed. "
Conversations with a Killer: The Ted Bundy Tapes,Reddit really does have no clue how human interaction works. 
Conversations with a Killer: The Ted Bundy Tapes,"I binge watched all 4 episodes in one night. Needless to say I felt extremely unsettled afterwards. With no guilty conscience Ted was able to do pretty much whatever he wanted while still conning people with his superficial charm and smile, even up to and including the last 24 hours of his life when he had that preacher eating out of the palm of his hand. 

Very disturbing. Most people go through life fearing judgment and ridicule from others. Often times it prevents people from truly reaching their potential because their fear of failure prevents them from taking risks. Ted, on the other hand, did whatever the hell he wanted at the expense of others, but because he did it with a smile on his face and cracked a few jokes here and there he endeared himself to damn near everyone he met. Even the judge who sentenced him to death for raping and murdering 30 women. 

Let that sink in. "
Conversations with a Killer: The Ted Bundy Tapes,"Keep in mind, at the time this trial was all over the news."
Conversations with a Killer: The Ted Bundy Tapes,"Reddit's gonna hate me for saying this, but the judge said that because he's a white dude. No way in hell would he say that about a black man that was about to get executed."
Conversations with a Killer: The Ted Bundy Tapes,"warning this is not how i think (because i agree with everyone else that Id probably tell Bundy I hope he burns in hell) but I dont think it is THAT strange. i can just quickly think of a few reasons. the judge couldve been playing it up for the cameras. the judge did just sentence a man to die. regardless of what Bundy did, that is an action which must weigh heavily. this could be the judges way of trying to absolve himself of some of the guilt. or he could just really value human life. not everything has to be because Bundy had a magical spell over every human he encountered "
Conversations with a Killer: The Ted Bundy Tapes,"If he had a jury for the initial arrest, he probably would’ve gotten away with it. "
Conversations with a Killer: The Ted Bundy Tapes,"I think the judge is more disappointed about what Ted could’ve been, especially after he defended himself in court."
Conversations with a Killer: The Ted Bundy Tapes,"white men literally can kill and eat people and ""it's a tragedy"" when they are punished for it. "
Conversations with a Killer: The Ted Bundy Tapes,"If the judge option of providing a lighter sentence, but isnt doing so.. maybe he's saying this to ease the mental burden of sending someone to death.  Reminding everyone, himself included, that this execution is a result of Bundy's choices and not the judge. 
"
Conversations with a Killer: The Ted Bundy Tapes,For those of you who enjoyed this there is an amazing book called the stranger beside me by Ann rule who is a crime author that actually knew Ted Bundy at the suicide hotline 
Conversations with a Killer: The Ted Bundy Tapes,"Ok but how can't you feel any animosity toward a guy that killed more than 30 people ?? 

I get that you represent Justice and such,but those people were your kin and they  were innocent people. 

Who cares about the lost potential of this fucker honestly? His presence in this world is a plague and he should be looking forward to remove this threat from walking on earth( I wouldn't say necessarily with death penalty but I get it in this case)"
Conversations with a Killer: The Ted Bundy Tapes,"I too thought it was a bit strange but the way I see it is that no halfway decent judge enjoys passing down a death sentence.

No matter how horrible the person in front of you is, it doesn't make it easier for a presumably good person like the judge to cast a judgement that will end a life.

In this case, I believe it was difficult for the judge to give the death sentence. He wishes he didn't have to and that none of this needed to happen but Ted had to be held responsible for his crimes. He recognised Ted's charm and intelligence and believed it to be an awful waste of what could've been a good lawyer. 

Then there is the possibility that he didn't want to be emotionally invested and risk blurring the lines between justice and revenge."
Conversations with a Killer: The Ted Bundy Tapes,"The judge saying he would’ve loved to see Ted as a lawyer in his court is akin to him saying “I’d love for those women to be alive and for you to be following a better path suitable to your positive potential.” 

It is very, very easy to look at an evil man and see only evil. The much more difficult path, and the path the judge took, was to look at the evil man and see lost potential. Ted could’ve been a great man and perhaps done a great service to humanity had he chosen a better path, but he didn’t. He gave in to a sick temptation born out of something I’m not sure any of us can understand. The judge had to oversee a case where a brilliant man with great potential had instead used that intelligence to prey on innocent women, and that is a tragedy. That is a waste of human life. 

Were Bundy a belligerent, foolish, bumbling buffoon who completely fit the bill and was good for nothing other than evil, it would’ve been a different tragedy altogether. I think it’s important that the judge acknowledge it, and acknowledge it publicly for the world to see he didn’t sentence this man to death for his own pleasure, and that he didn’t sentence men to death whimsically, that this was a decision that was just and necessary, but not a joyful occasion. 

Neither the death of the women murdered or the punishment required for such a beast are things we should take joy in, and I applaud the judge for handling it appropriately. "
Conversations with a Killer: The Ted Bundy Tapes,"You know what I found laughable? I think it was episode three when they had caught him in Florida and didn’t know who he was. His law-talking guy was like
“You can’t not give him bail if he doesn’t give you his name. “
Judge says “err, yes I can dude”
“Well, that’s what they say. Eh, oh well “
He looked like a complete knob up there and didn’t even try to give a precedent or argue back. I understand he was probably getting paid, like seven dollars to show up, but still..."
Conversations with a Killer: The Ted Bundy Tapes,"Compassion, treating people as human beings, and actually trying to understand someone - all very rare in the US justice system, whose entire goal is to fill prisons, punish, and profit. Corrupt to the core."
Conversations with a Killer: The Ted Bundy Tapes,Watching bundy ask the officer to describe the position of the victim’s arms was just repulsive.
Conversations with a Killer: The Ted Bundy Tapes,I think that's commendable. What use is a judge who is unwilling to see both sides of the coin? That is the definition of good judgment. 
Conversations with a Killer: The Ted Bundy Tapes,"I know I'm jumping on this bandwagon late but my mother is a therapist and early on worked in the local high schools with ""delinquents"" and they were the worst the county had to offer. Second generation crack babies who deserved the best she had to give. She literally had one light a desk on fire and throw it at her. Rough kids from terribly sad backgrounds. She stayed up until all hours one night baking cupcakes for one because he had told her in counseling one day that his mother woke him up every year on his birthday screaming at him that this was the day he ruined her life by being born. 

One of them wrote her years later that at that point in his life he saw his life in front of him and he could either choose to take his internal darkness and become Jeffrey Dalmer or use it to become Stephen King. He wrote to her that because of her counseling he chose Stephen King. It is still one of her greatest moments in what can be a terribly depressing career. Not saying these monsters deserve any pass, more just emphasizing that they have the ability to choose their path. This one did not. "
Conversations with a Killer: The Ted Bundy Tapes,Sometimes it’s hard putting someone to death? Even a murderer?
Innocent,She was like my favourite thing early on in Agents of Shield.
Innocent,The more Ruth Negga the better.
Innocent,You had me at ‘Ruth Negga’ …
Innocent,I worked with Ruth on Preacher. She is an absolute delight! Hope this show does well!
Innocent,Not a big role but I don't know how many people know that she was the Emerald Herald in Dark Souls 2. Surprised me when I saw it.
Innocent,She’s a great actor
Innocent,Loved her in Misfits as well.
Innocent,"Love her, she super talented."
Innocent,"She gave the best performance of Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. (and every marvel property) by a mile, can’t wait to see more"
Innocent,She is a phenominal actress. Check her out in her work. My favorite one was Preacher
Innocent,Ruth Negga please!
Innocent,I've been a fan since she starred in a movie about a killer mutated cow.
Innocent,Putting it on a platform nobody has 🙌
Innocent,But why can't Hollywood find other stories.  Remake after remake.
Innocent,"I'll add this to the list of things JJ Abrams has made since his quarter billion dollar contract with Warner Bros was signed -

Warner Bros

 • Lovecraft Country (cancelled after a season)

Other - 

 • Lou (Netflix)

 • Challenger documentary (Netflix)

 • Little Voice (Apple)

 • Lisey's Story (Apple)

 • Spider-Man comic (Disney)

 • UFO documentary (Showtime)

* Presumed Innocent (Apple)"
Innocent,[removed]
Innocent,"Woah, imagine being black and having that last name."
Innocent,"Hmmm. Interesting that they're remaking a mid-tier legal thriller from the 90s as a prestige TV show. It's like studios are admitting their bread-and-butter in the 80s and 90s could only ever get made in the 2020s as a tv series.

Let's look at the cast so far!

Harrison Ford -> Jake Gyllenhaal. **Step down**. No shot at Jake but, like... it's Harrison Ford.

Bonnie Bedelia -> **Ruth Negga**. Step up! Maybe even two steps up.

what'll be interesting are the next two. Who do they get to play the Raul Julia and Greta Scacchi roles? And for the love of Pete - who do you get to fill BRIAN DENNEHY'S MASSIVE SHOES, HUH?

*WHO REPLACES THE DENNEHY!?!?*"
Innocent,Sometimes my friend call me by my last name (“Hey X”) cause there’s two people with same first names in my group.  I bet no one calls Ruth by her last name in public … haha
Innocent,Ok imma need a step by step guide on how to pronounce that before I get lynched for saying it wrong.
Innocent,This was one of my favorites reads ever. Apple will do a great job with it.
Innocent,"Ruth can be great as in Loving, or absolutely terrible as in Agents of Shield; quite the extremes for this girl"
Innocent,[deleted]
Innocent,"first time I´ve heard of her , and damn, white Americans must struggle with her last name ;)"
Innocent,Didn't she sing Mambo No. 5?
Innocent,she’s such a fox.
Innocent,Jake Gullenhaal was repeatedly exposed as a creep. I’m done with him
Innocent,The original Presumed Innocent had a score by [John Williams](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZ3C3222uw4) which was one of his best piano led scores.
Innocent,Flowers!
Innocent,Now so must watch the show.
Innocent,Her and Kyle MacLaclan were great as early season antagonists (who were sometimes helpful).
Innocent,"I absolutely hated her, very talented actress but very hateable character oh my."
Innocent,I don’t even care what this show is about. I’m all in
Innocent,Amen brother.
Innocent,Too bad she’s stuck in stuff like this… sounds like typical David E. Kelley schlock
Innocent,She is attached to a Josephine Baker project and I hope it happens.
Innocent,"I really enjoyed her and Tessa Thompson in ""Passing"" on Netflix. Two really good actors and both absolutely gorgeous"
Innocent,Amen.
Innocent,"""Bearer of the c-""

""Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah just let me level up already!"""
Innocent,"I thought I recognised her , brilliant actor"
Innocent,Amazing in Preacher too
Innocent,"While it's your opinion, saying she had the best performance in AOS is a very very long stretch."
Innocent,I've never heard of this title before.
Innocent,"Bad Robot is not associated with MI 7 and 8, it’s even listed as a factoid on its Wikipedia pages."
Innocent,But the actual output made for WB is... almost non-existent. Yikes.
Innocent,"Eww, he’s associated with Dead Reckoning?"
Innocent,JJ Abrams is garbage.
Innocent,"Yup, this is another symptom of AT&T throwing out money of WB willy-nilly"
Innocent,Better than being white and having that last name.
Innocent,"Interesting that a bunch of films in the adult thriller genre are being rebooted for tv, there’s that American Gigolo reboot that no one talks about, an upcoming Fatal Attraction tv series, this, a [Damage](https://www.whats-on-netflix.com/news/damage-netflix-thriller-limited-series-what-we-know-so-far/) tv series…"
Innocent,"Not sure why they are downvoting you, you’re not wrong."
Innocent,Yes she is has very broad acting skills
Innocent,"if you wanna be unoriginal, sure"
Innocent,r u high
Innocent,Source? I can't find anything on it
Innocent,i like how she went into terragenesis expecting to be beautiful and ended up sonic the hedghog
Innocent,She was also in Preacher as well. The show is based off of the comics.
Innocent,It's really bad
Innocent,I mostly was enamored with her because she looked like someone i knew from my youth. :)
Innocent,[deleted]
Innocent,She was just in Passing the year before and she was phenomenal in it. And she does great theatre. She just played Lady Macbeth on Broadway alongside Daniel Craig.
Innocent,I want to remain cautiously optimistic since Apple's average quality of output is pretty good. There are some sinkers but fingers crossed.
Innocent,"Oh, that's good casting."
Innocent,Bear-Seek-Seek-Lest
Innocent,"Yeah, Brett Dalton chewed the scenery from season 2 onwards. And if we're including all Marvel properties then several actors on Legion take the cake."
Innocent,I really think her performance as Raina was truly awe-inspiring.  She really sold the persuasiveness of the character with her delivery and did it so well the renamed the episode she first appeared in after her due to how striking her performance was.
Innocent,1990 thriller with Harrison Ford
Innocent,He’s been a producer on every single *Mission Impossible* movie that’s come out since he directed the third one.
Innocent,"Also, apple already have an ongoing Harrison Ford remake from the late 80s- Mosquito Coast."
Innocent,"The American Gigolo reboot got pretty bad reviews, largely saying it was much worse than the film. Plus it was on Showtime so that might be why no one talks about it."
Innocent,Source: Their ass
Innocent,"""I thought her gift was spinning really fast and collecting gold rings"""
Innocent,Yeah I liked here in Preacher but never read the comics.
Innocent,"You're a grown man, would you ever fucking grow up lad."
Innocent,"I personally think Iain De Caestecker was the best actor in that show.  
also the season Ruth was in thee was also Kyle MacLachlan as a recuring character and he was really really good."
Innocent,">Brett Dalton chewed the scenery 

Hold on, that's not usually a good thing."
Innocent,"I would argue no ones performance in the show was actually ""awe-inspiring"".  Especially during the last few seasons.  If anyone in the show should be deemed the best actor it should be Iain De Caestecker."
Innocent,I think that's outside his WB deal.
Innocent,oh yeah I’m aware it’s not hitting with critics and thus is lost in the whole streaming sludge. There’s probably fans of the original who have no idea there’s a reboot lol
Innocent,That's precisely the source I thought it was coming from.
Innocent,hahahahaha one of the best lines of that show. It had such zingers.
Innocent,"Well said, male g spot"
Innocent,"Iain was great, I think enough also can't be said for Mallory Jansen who absolutely chewed her scenes. She was one of the driving reasons I went on to watch Gallavant and I'm glad I did, great actress."
Innocent,"It is when you know the vehicle is kinda shlocky. Look, I mod /r/shield and love the show, but I have no delusions about it being high art. It is a very basic super hero show but executed very well. And when Brett was on screen, you knew you were going to be entertained."
Innocent,"I'm really sad he hasn't been in more stuff. Dude legit has acting chops and range, but the most notable thing he's done in terms of the larger acting world thus far was a minor bit in Overlord (which he was pretty good in as well)."
Innocent,"> It is when you know the vehicle is kinda shlocky.

Or when your character has lost his grip on reality, which Ward definitely had."
Innocent,Still can’t believe he mugged a dwarf stripper.
Innocent,"I watched it a couple weeks ago. I enjoyed it. Felt like a followup to The Wire (many of the same people are involved) though more openly didactic. I felt like the character Nicole Steele from the DOJ Office of Civil Rights (Wunmi Mosaku) mostly existed as an audience surrogate to have things explained to her.

Jamie Hector as Detective Suiter was heartbreakingly good though."
Innocent,I still can't believe Bernthal wasn't nominated for an Emmy for this.
Innocent,"This show was pretty good. Bernthal put a lot of research into portraying Wayne Jenkins. My favorite story is how he had the vest on in court, and the staff went to get him some proper clothing. He showed them that the real Wayne Jenkins wore his vest in court too."
Innocent,"If I had been a Baltimore cop, I would have found Wayne Jenkins to be annoying as fuck."
Innocent,Pretty good series
Innocent,https://www.menshealth.com/entertainment/a39814840/we-own-this-city-true-story-wayne-jenkins/
Innocent,"Oh cool, it's got Jon ""The Punisher"" Bernthal in. Gotta be worth a watch."
Innocent,"Great show, also Jon Bernthal rules, major positive whenever he’s in anything"
Innocent,"I found this show to be not great, not terrible.  About 3.6 roentgens"
Innocent,C+
Innocent,"He’s great in it and it’s a great show.  However he walks in this show like he’s got a load in his pants or his legs/feet are fucked up.   It was kind of distracting .


Other than that pretty damn good"
Innocent,"I haven't seen it. But on a scale of banana to smoked ribs, I give it a medium rare steak!"
Innocent,"That was.... well, had to be true since no one would have written such a scene in a serious show."
Justice,Still remember this after all these years. It was a truly interesting idea/moment in the superhero world
Justice,"This is from the series finale ""Destroyer"". Lex ex machina or not. This is one of the high points of the series & DCAU. I'm probably due for a rewatch on all this."
Justice,I've always felt this speech would have been a lot more powerful if he got more than 2 hits in before getting bodied.
Justice,"""always taking constant care not to break something""

\*proceeds to demolish city\*

😆

Jokes aside, it's a good speech and IMO Superman's most interesting aspect."
Justice,"Justice League Unlimited was truly ahead of its time. It could have had so many more episodes, so many stories to tell, I absolutely loved the episodes revolving around other members like Huntress and Question, Black Canary and Green Arrow... I'm just thankful for what we got. 


As for this scene. I like how the world of cardboard speech was the writers' way of addressing fan complaints about how Superman jobs all the time in the show. It is a teensy bit unfortunate though that such a great scene and display of power is rendered moot by Darkseid literally just clicking on his utility belt and incapacitating superman with some weird net weapon."
Justice,Divx 🤓
Justice,i was so sad as a kid when they cancelled this
Justice,"Superman has a lot of great moments in this series. One of my favorites being when he fights both Brainiac and Darkseid(brainiac possess Darkseid I think?), and he's just dishing out the punishment on Darkseid.

Superman fights Captain Atom who uses Red Sun energy to weaken Superman. Superman had to hold back and still won.

Superman fights Doomsday in a Volcano while trying to contain the eruption at the same time so the Justice League can safely evacuate the locals. Even then Superman had to hold back so he didn't worsen the eruption.

Justice Lord Superman fights Doomsday before that Volcano fight, and he lobotomizes DD at the end.

Probably the most heartbreaking Superman moment is... oh there's two of them.

- Starro latches itself onto his chest and feeds him dreams of Krypton where he's a father taking care of his family. Then when he's free, he goes berserk on Mongul.

- He gets ""killed"" by Toyman but he's really sent into the distance future where he bumps into Vandal Savage. They help each other to return him home but at a major cost for Savage."
Justice,"About halfway through watching this series for the first time, really impressed with it so far. I think it might even be my favourite on screen version of the Justice League?"
Justice,"One of the best comic book content ever made. Certainly the best DC non comic content. The DCAU is also fantastic but this show just did everything right. It still baffles me how Warner brother just dont take a look what people loved so much about this version and try to somewhat replicate it, instead of the litteral trash they put into live action."
Justice,It’s one of my favorite moments in all of comic book media.
Justice,Overrated
Justice,"Yeah, it was also a great way to handwave why Superman is relatively weak sometimes and even gets to weaker then weaker the enemy is.

He doesn't use most of his power most of the time, because that would just wreck shit. And going from that he probably uses too little rather than too much power unless there is something like Doomsday or Darkseid, because a little bit too much could turn people like Lex Luthor into goo.

Superman for most of his enemies is fighting awkwardly with one finger trying to not break them and stuff around them."
Justice,It only the DCU could get it as right as this show
Justice,"In defense of the Lex Ex Machina, Lex Luthor felt like a main character that last season and basically gets to achieve his goals of becoming god-like while going out on top while actually doing one of his only non-selfish actions to defeat an actual alien threat.  Though just suddenly bringing Metron in was rushed."
Justice,"Is it just me, or is the voice acting not great?"
Justice,Right? Darksied isn't even all that phased and proceeds to body him with a handwave. The Season 2 opener for regular JL had a much more brilliant fight between them.
Justice,"Man, I remember tuning into Toonami back in the day and just hearing the voice of Optimus Prime announce ""This time the league is UNLIMITED"".

It moved hard into the B and C heroes, and I never realized I needed those stories so much until after I saw them.  You could see the writers had so much more flexibility with Unlimited and it made for one of my all time favorite animations."
Justice,"I felt like it ended at the right time

The last season was basically fan service"
Justice,Only the real OGs know
Justice,"Ah takes me back to high school. Wait for new episodes of Stargate SG-1 and Atlantis to get uploaded to Stage6, download them, convert from DivX to MP4, dump on my iPod Nano 3rd gen and watch on the bus to/from school."
Justice,Xvid forever!
Justice,I feel like this season was a victory lap anyway.  The prior season had the proper DCAU ending with Epilogue.
Justice,"Spider-Man is the same, he constantly holds back against street level enemies. Not knowing this, when Doc Ock took over his body, he accidentally immediately broke Scorpion's jaw when fighting him."
Justice,"It was a truly epic masterpiece. Batman the Animated Series, Superman the Animated Series, The New Batman Adventures, Static Shock, Justice League and Justice League Unlimited, Batman Beyond, even The Zeta Project all contributed to the DC Animated Universe building blocks of artistry."
Justice,"Gunn has mentioned both this and Young Justice as inspirations, so maybe there's hope."
Justice,"Well, I believe this was Darkseid merged with some Brainiac tech due to Lex being betrayed by his girlfriend he abused and sacrificed."
Justice,"Yeah the B and C heroes are the best part. There's a reason why I love that batfamily stories more than batman himself. I prefer seeing the lesser heroes and how they admire the original 7 as these near mythic figures  to  aspire to be like. And especially true about the flexibility line, when the powers aren't as broken it opens up the story much more. Not to mention all the new dynamics that can be created like booster gold, and then  there's existing relationships that were further explored like hawkgirl with flash and fire, shayera with Vixen and green lantern..."
Justice,And still managed to have some of the best episodes of the entire show in it.
Justice,"""broke his jaw"" sort of undersells the punch. With a single swing he took scorpions jaw clean off. Scorpions jaw was no more. It is an ex-jaw.

Superior Spider-Man has some pretty fucking rad stuff. But the jaw punch is pretty goddamn stellar. The sudden realization of ""ohhh fuuuuuck"" that Ock has when he realizes Peter had been pulling his punches from day 1. 

My boys got an arm like a fuckin freight train."
Justice,"So many people shit on superior but goddamn Slott really 'got' both Parker and Ock in profound ways. Revealing the perspective of Parker's life from someone outside it both served to take the piss out of some of his character yet justify a lot more. In the end, Parker was revealed to be an even deeper character than people realized which is saying a lot because he was arguably Marvel's most iconic character at the time. Tom Holland's Spiderman benefits immensely from the exploration Slott gave the character."
Justice,So what? It still heavily undercuts this epic speech. Good thing Lex Luthor was around to save his ass.
Justice,Which episodes?
Justice,"Patriot Act might be my favourite episode from that show, but the run from Flash and Substance through Ancient History is all top tier stuff."
Justice,"

Justice,"Justice League and Justice League Unlimited has some of the best moments in all of comic book entertainment; wholesome ones like this included.  

I should probably rewatch both this month before they leave HBOMax on 1/31."
Justice,The flash portion of this episode is also fantastic
Justice,I love that Superman is trying to use his X-Ray vision to try to see his presents early.
Justice,This is honestly the kind of Superman I want to see in the movies.
Justice,"One might think he went onto the roof to give the girl the joy of hearing Santa, but in reality he was just there cause she mentioned free cookies"
Justice,Comfort and Joy is a Christmas tradition. I adore how wholesome this segment is
Justice,Why is he naked with the cat at the end?
Justice,"J'onn J'onzz is very fond of what us earthlings refer to as ""cookies""."
Justice,This show is leaving HBO max next month :(
Justice,"If the DCU movie franchise is rebooted to be more like JLU. Then please...please do it right. It has so much potential. They just have to watch the animated shows to figure out what made it so successful.

Superman, Batman and JLU. They can build outward from there and it will be beautiful."
Justice,"The sheer brilliance of DC animated always makes me feel bad for how utterly mismanaged the DCEU was, they made edgelords make the films instead of people who actually knew the material. Here's hoping future DC films give us moments like this, give us the real Superman instead of what they wrote and made Cavill endure."
Justice,This was beautiful
Justice,The Animated Series Superman is the best Superman.  There I said it.
Justice,I just rewatched last night. Fantastic
Justice,RDC World’s Christmas who wants to be a millionaire had this episode as a critical bit of knowledge
Justice,Hello.
Justice,Love that episode
Justice,This is one of the best and most emotional episodes on tv
Justice,Is lead ductile enough to make a foil out of to use in wrapping paper?
Justice,I'm not crying.  You are.
Justice,Ma is high as hell right now
Justice,"Batman threatens the Martian with matchsticks, whereas Superman brings the Martian to meet his family to spend Christmas with. Such a goody-two-shoes."
Justice,Naked stroking a cat is the optimal way to do Christmas 🎄
Justice,"IIRC the “lead-lined presents” thing is a callback to Superman: The Animated Series, where the Kents mention that they—I mean, Santa—did this so Clark couldn’t peek."
Justice,What the fuck why would they be leaving HBO max
Justice,Thanks for the heads up
Justice,[deleted]
Justice,The writing is spot on. I recall a few notable episodes like Grundy and Birdnose :(
Justice,"I actually just started watching JL Unlimited and I'm really liking it. So many heroes in it, it's pretty cool... Bummer they're removing it, I just started getting into it.

Recently started reading comics after wanting to for so long"
Justice,"Honestly... some of the best moments in television as a whole in my opinion. The Cadmus plotline was top tier writing, while the Thanagarian invasion was some blockbuster stuff. And the original series opening theme? I still get shivers when I listen to it."
Justice,Do you know how much of DC animation is leaving HBO Max?
Justice,DCAU’s Wally West is just the best in general. I love how goofy he is while also being undoubtedly the most caring individual of the group. Flash and Substance is one of my favorites for that exact reason (plus all the Easter eggs to his rogues gallery and history lol)
Justice,"Him and the Ultra-Humanite rebuilding the busted toy for the kids and the Ultra-Humanite touched that the Flash spends time with orphans on Christmas that he was willing to put aside his differences for them.

Then how Flash thanked him at the end for his help.

DCAU captured why people love these characters so damn much."
Justice,"""...*Flash.* It is **Christmas.""**"
Justice,Even better that his parents have probably been using lead wrapping paper for years. Or…totally not healthy.
Justice,"“Lead… *checks another present* Lead…”

It makes him more endearing. 

More when he insists that Santa brought the presents. 

Yes, he’s an alien raised the Kents, but damn it, Santa’s real to him!

(Though I wouldn’t be surprised if Santa was real in the comics. Just a good natured superhero wanting to spread cheer to everybody one day out of the year.)"
Justice,He might have felt it first and then confirmed it.
Justice,"Or how he literally jumped out of bed in the morning because he was excited for Christmas, Never change Clark!"
Justice,I just want to see a Superman that actually acts like a human rather than constantly being a figure so disconnected from humanity. No wonder nobody gave a fuck when he died at the end of the second DCEU movie.
Justice,Everything about the DCAU approached perfection for me. I think there’s something about the animated format that makes the DC properties work as well as Marvel does in live action.
Justice,"What, you don't like ol' Superman bringing the fight to Metropolis and killing who knows how many people while fighting Zodd?"
Justice,"""Hereafter"" from JL is one of the best Superman stories ever IMO. You get to see what he means to everyone else and his resiliance and spirit in one hour."
Justice,"DC gets animated and comics right much better than Marvel IMO. And up until the modern superhero craze, they were the only real game in town for live action as Batman and Superman movies were the only ones people really watched in the 80s and 90s. But it's a lot harder to put this kind of fluff into a movie over longer format shows like the cartoon, which had a runtime of like 14 hours."
Justice,"one of my favorite endings ever

""it requires a level twelve intellect to survive""

""im overqualified"""
Justice,"And so began his addiction to Oreos, a storyline from the comics that would've been part of an episode of JLU (an episode paying tribute to Justice League International) but was cut at the last minute."
Justice,"He is in his natural form. Which didn't wear clothes since they can shape-shift their genitals when it is sexy time. 

And the cat rejected him earlier. Now it accepts him representing him feeling welcomed and comfortable. So he shares some of his culture with his singing on Christmas morning."
Justice,"He's actually always naked.  His ""clothing"" is just for appearances around others, it's actually part of his body.  He reverts his original state when alone or just around his cat."
Justice,"You can't judge another species like that , do you think it's inappropriate for the cat to be naked ? 

Martians don't need to wear clothes , he just does it to make humans around him comfortable"
Justice,to relate to the cat
Justice,"Lmao! i just realized how it looks to somebody who doesn't know about J'onn, yes he's a nudist but he's ""our nudist""."
Justice,"Gunn recently confirmed on Twitter that JLU and YJ are what the DCU is being modeled around. 

We won."
Justice,James Gunn confirmed the DCU will be based on JLU and YJ
Justice,"Given that the Mythbusters used lead foil to make a lead balloon that floated, I'd say yes."
Justice,Because motherfucker Zaslav is saving a few bucks by removing it (rather than pay residuals).
Justice,"Blame Zavlav. To make money, he's removing some shows from HBO Max and licencing them out to other streaming services so WBD gets extra money out of them that they otherwise wouldn't get from their own platform."
Justice,Started a rewatch because of it.
Justice,To sell to other streamers
Justice,"""That's Lobo. L as in Lacerate. O as in obliterate. B as in disem-BOWEL. And O as in...well we can use obliterate twice right?"""
Justice,"> I recall a few notable episodes like Grundy and Birdnose :(

Bro, why you gotta do this to me? :("
Justice,"At the moment it's Justice League, Justice League Unlimited and Batman: The Brave and the Bold"
Justice,I live when lex luthor swaps bodies with him and unmasks him only to realize he has no idea who Wally West is.
Justice,Wish the flash had gotten a DCAU cartoon. His supporting cast and rogues gallery was big enough to support one.
Justice,This episode is such a wonderful Christmas homage. It makes you feel all the things a good Christmas story should have
Justice,They have. They say so earlier in the episode lol
Justice,You mean Santa has been using lead wrapping paper?
Trigger Warning with Killer Mike,[deleted]
Trigger Warning with Killer Mike,Who’s the cam girl from episode 2?
Trigger Warning with Killer Mike,"Personally I was waiting for him to reveal the joke after about 2 episodes.
When he went to the principal and in all honesty asked her to put porn on the curriculum, I laughed in surprise like; ""Mike, fo' real?""

When he was making New Africa I was surprised he did not go ""PSYCH!"" at the end because it just seemed so little thought through. You're gonna invite people in on the promise of celebrating their individuality, and then make them all swear the same oath on the same book, and everybody needs to wear the same clothes for teamwork? That's not celebrating individuality, that is the opposite!

And then he just abbandons democracy all together and forges the election. Why?


And I'm genuinely asking: can anyone explain to me why Mario was being racist when he argued with Mike?
I know he apologized later on, but he never cleared it up. He just kinda shot Mario down.


This might be the unpopular opinion, but I think; either Killer Mike just shat on the concept of televised radicalism as a joke.
Or he was serious.

The latter option makes me lose a lot of respect for him.
"
Trigger Warning with Killer Mike,"Three episodes in, the third one is the best one. The living black episode was ok but I don't think it was well thought out. The second episode is just not good. I get the Nathan for You absurdity but idk just not on par. "
Trigger Warning with Killer Mike,"Ep 2, Fuck School, was just plain weird and put me off watching the rest"
Trigger Warning with Killer Mike,Finished this in one sitting when it came out and was super surprised that not many people were talking about it. I agree with the issue with tone changes but I still found it very fun to watch and hope it gets another season - the educational porn bit and crip-a-cola were too good 
Trigger Warning with Killer Mike,Crip-a-Cola episode is so amazing! 
Trigger Warning with Killer Mike,What’s it about ? 
Trigger Warning with Killer Mike,I finished all six episodes in one sitting.  I really enjoyed it personally.
Trigger Warning with Killer Mike,The man is a genius
Trigger Warning with Killer Mike,"I really like it, he's such an interesting person, he is very good at playing a sort of devils advocate to get conversation going. Plus he's just generally a very entertaining individual "

Anybody know if these are just black vendors or are the products manufactured by black owned companies as well? "

Trigger Warning with Killer Mike,Im already starting my own church of Sleep!
Trigger Warning with Killer Mike,Wtf this guy is a racist and makes black people looks worse. The idea of worshiping yourself or race is ignorant and narcissistic. 
Trigger Warning with Killer Mike,"I couldn't make it through the second episode. I turned it off when he jumped on that white kid who raised his hand to ask a question, and then Mike went into some white privilege bullshit. "
Trigger Warning with Killer Mike,"I just finished the 3rd episode and man, it's good.  I'm really digging this."
Trigger Warning with Killer Mike,https://www.shesfreaky.com/video/big-titties-on-a-slim-girl-158443.html?playlist=2371
Trigger Warning with Killer Mike,"I just finished it and was underwhelmed, disappointed even. I'm a huge Run the Jewels fan and the concept looked promising, but the quality of the episodes varies greatly. By the last one, the series had turned into a complete mess of a freak show and what started as ""probably fake"" was ""definitely fake"" by then. Mike is a smart guy, with a lot of great ideas. Hopefully this is just a bump in the road and Netflix offers him the chance to make a serious documentary about his views on some of the subjects tackled in the series."
Trigger Warning with Killer Mike,"I felt this too. It's a shame that he started with a good point each and every time and managed to descend into complete absurdity to... prove a point? I don't even know. I take all the issues he discussed seriously and I almost felt like I was being mocked for taking them seriously. I felt stupid for coming to the table and expecting actual solutions to problems and not just completely unhinged ideas based in some alternate reality where someone who works for the music industry has the gall to tell random strangers ""fuck your dreams"". "
Trigger Warning with Killer Mike,"I agree with this, and it's what I love about it. I was recommended the show on /r/nathanforyou, hearing ""it's basically a black Nathan For You,"" and that recommendation wasn't wrong, but you can tell that Killer Mike has a hint of seriousness behind what he does, where Nathan always wanted to be as absurd as possible (but in the most subtle way possible), without actually calling out any actual discussions that the audience should consider on a serious level. Killer Mike ended the first episode with a sort-of tongue-in-cheek call to action, but it was mostly serious."
Trigger Warning with Killer Mike,For real
Trigger Warning with Killer Mike,"Bing motherfucker, the new place no one wants to go to find pirated movies and other random shit google is now actively censoring.

Trigger Warning with Killer Mike,[deleted]
Trigger Warning with Killer Mike,"Agree with you 100%. The show made me lose respect for Killer Mike which is a real shame. 

P.S. I also thought it was great how he, a successful rich raper, was telling others not to bother with their dreams and learn a practical trade. Easy for you to say Mike, you are a famous multimillionaire! "
Trigger Warning with Killer Mike,You can watch his breakfast club interview. Everyone saying it’s satire is wrong. Mike really does hold these views. 
Trigger Warning with Killer Mike,"It is an enigma. The point of the documentary, in my opinion, isn’t to agree on any certain terms. It is to live the experience of a reality that is constructed from the remnants of imagination. There is, after all, everything. All together, at once, we create fascination with the artistic forms of splendor that are represented in the documentary. That’s all we know. That what we live for. There are protests happening all around this nation. Those are the places we start. That is the imagination we produce. Relentlessly, we create. "
Trigger Warning with Killer Mike,"The second episode made me stop watching. When I realized he genuinely thought teaching first graders how to build cabinets was ""fixing the education system,"" I couldn't take him seriously anymore. "
Trigger Warning with Killer Mike,I also hated it. Dumbest thing I've ever seen.
Trigger Warning with Killer Mike,That Mario guy though. I was hoping he'd run away crying 
Trigger Warning with Killer Mike,"Killer Mike from Run The Jewels exploring social issues. One episode explores ""white gang privilege"" where he sets to empower black gangs by helping them to create a legitimate soda business, crip-a-cola, to help change perceptions about them. 

It's a hard one to explain, equal parts Micheal Moore documentary and a ""woke"" Nathan for you. "
Trigger Warning with Killer Mike,I live in the US and feel the exact same way. 
Trigger Warning with Killer Mike,When Ariana Huffington showed up I started screaming holy fuck
Trigger Warning with Killer Mike,"He would know more than anyone how hard it is and how few people are financially successful.  If you can make money as a plumber or anything other trade, than you'd have the freedom to practice music on your own time instead of working for minimum wage just to get by.  "
Trigger Warning with Killer Mike,"This captures exactly how my gf and I feel. If it is to be taken seriously, the show is naive and frustrating. If it is to be taken as satire, it simply isn't funny. There's no positive spin to the show. "

Trigger Warning with Killer Mike,"That pic of her bent over +1

Trigger Warning with Killer Mike,Nothing comes up which is weird.
Trigger Warning with Killer Mike,I just want to see a tiddy. If you google jammavanburan stuff pops up but no tiddy :(
Trigger Warning with Killer Mike,[deleted]
Trigger Warning with Killer Mike,The show was a joke. It’s satire. He’s laughing at both sides and at people who take their identity so seriously.
Trigger Warning with Killer Mike,It was actually good advice though. The one in a million who made it actually telling you you don't have a chance is refreshing because it's true. Most of the show isn't super thought through but it's entertaining enough.
Trigger Warning with Killer Mike,"Dude, whatever you're smoking, I want some."
Trigger Warning with Killer Mike,"I don't think he was anyway serious with that. But I hope he really didn't tell the kids they can't be president. What worked in Nathan for You was the character Nathan Fielder put up, while Killer Mike had a public political persona and carried the same thing in his show. So it's hard to guage whether he had to go to strip clubs and meet a cam girl , hire porn actors and just didn't want to pay for it himself or so he has an excuse to tell his wife. "
Trigger Warning with Killer Mike,Try being sex positive for once.
Trigger Warning with Killer Mike,"Goddammit i googled trigger warning reddit in hope that someone would say this. What an asshole. Al Pacino being good actor in a good movie =/= not celebrating organized white crime. Damn. Then to straight up ignore Andrew Jackson's atrocities to delve into ""real problems in America."" What an idiot."
Trigger Warning with Killer Mike,Crip-a-cola reminds me a lot of Saint's Flow.
Trigger Warning with Killer Mike,It’s a comedy show?
Trigger Warning with Killer Mike,"It's just weird to me because of how much that's not a solution. The jobs that currently exist at minimum wage still need to exist. We can't move 100% of people at the minimum wage into the trades and still function well as a society. You also can't build a modern economy solely on the trades. So to tell everyone that the solution to poverty is going into the trades is....just stupid, frankly. It is a great solution for the next decade or two, and to help out individual people, but it doesn't actually help long-term societal issues that people on the Left are usually worried about (I bring up the Left since Killer Mike has been so active with Bernie Sanders).

Things like that are why I found this show confusing. The main skits and ideas are clearly meant to be satirical, but then the non-satirical takeaway is short-term stuff that works for a few individuals but doesn't actually fix major issues. I'm still lost as to whether the takeaways were also meant to be satirical."
Trigger Warning with Killer Mike,I got all this tiddy money for the black economy but how am i spose to spend it
Trigger Warning with Killer Mike,"thats the best interpretation so far I think. people taking their identity too seriously. Throughout the show you see his capacity to speak with and communicate to everyone of all backgrounds/shapes and sizes with the SAME exact level of courtesy/ respect AND attitude. Unapolagetically. Meanwhile I think the only thing Mike really does take seriously is plugging money into black-owned business/ communities. I think thats the only thing he truly cares about, is bringing in economy to black business. "
Trigger Warning with Killer Mike,If you watch the whole season he's in other episodes and it's very obvious he's got many problems. 
Trigger Warning with Killer Mike,"Has comedy elements just because of Killer Mike and LP. 

More social commentary. "
Trigger Warning with Killer Mike,not primarily but it does get hilarious at times
Trigger Warning with Killer Mike,Long term every minimum wage job will be automated
Trigger Warning with Killer Mike,Exactly someone please find something or at least her stream site.
Trigger Warning with Killer Mike,"Mario, who was clearly an actor, was the epitome of someone who takes his identity too seriously. He was meant to be a grotesque example of that idea. I also agree that the only thing that the “real” Killer Mike probably cares about is putting money into black owned businesses. But, even in that first episode you can see a bit of evidence that it is scripted, when El P is at the diner and says something like “glad you were finally able to find a black owned business and eat some food from a black owned farm,” which seems a bit too on the nose in retrospect, and also ended up being the reason Mike wasn’t able to eat. "
Trigger Warning with Killer Mike,Why must mario do me like this
Trigger Warning with Killer Mike,"I find it strange that anyone believed Mario wasn’t an actor. The show is pure satire. Insanely well done to the point where it’s a “debate” about whether or not it is real. Killer Mike was not taking these solutions seriously, he was having fun."
Trigger Warning with Killer Mike,So El-P is featured? I might watch it then. Killer Mike has lost all credibility to talk about social issues 
Trigger Warning with Killer Mike,"I agree that those jobs are going to disappear, but ""minimum wage"" will always be a necessary concept in a wage-based system. Current minimum wage jobs disappearing is not the same thing as the minimum wage becoming obsolete. If things become automated then the minimum wage job at that time will be supervising and doing maintenance on the machines, etc. "
Trigger Warning with Killer Mike,"thats interested people think so much of it was scripted - i dont watch alotta TV - but it must've been a hybrid of sorts. Like they got a buncha brobros for the taste testing, but picked out which ones they wanted, and then capitalized on Mario cause Im sure his actual personality is fairly douchey, and offered him something to play up his role and be more apart of the show. Cause versely in the porno episode, Mike clearly just made a bunch of randoms really uncomfortable"
Trigger Warning with Killer Mike,PHRASING!
Trigger Warning with Killer Mike,One must be done like that.
Trigger Warning with Killer Mike,"About 3 weeks too late, but it looked like Mike was taking this a little bit seriously...at least to me. "
Trigger Warning with Killer Mike,[deleted]
Trigger Warning with Killer Mike,Why?
Trigger Warning with Killer Mike,See I don’t think it was totally random in the porn one. I think it was a little suspicious having all the black guys saying they are rappers. The first couple episodes are light on the script and then it’s gets more and more until the last episode which is clearly scripted from the get go. There is no way any of those people thought they were creating a new country lol.
Trigger Warning with Killer Mike,And mario brought the native american genocide to try to win brownie points...
Trigger Warning with Killer Mike,[deleted]
Trigger Warning with Killer Mike,"the last episode i turned it off actually, it just turned into the eric andre show. if it werent for all the costumes - the jewish lady - i might've stomached it but I was like 'ok'..."
Trigger Warning with Killer Mike,"And he called them Indians, while being offended at the word MOIST"
Trigger Warning with Killer Mike,"I guess this is why RTJ4 has been taking so long, looks interesting at least."
Trigger Warning with Killer Mike,"I ran into killer Mike last spring with a film crew and they filmed us talking for about 5 minutes. I asked what the cameras were for and he said they were filming a Netflix doc. Hopefully I don’t look like an idiot in this if they use that footage, but he did give me free tickets to his sold out show the next day and took a selfie with me. We couldn’t take a picture with my iPhone because he said black people use Androids lol, but after the Android pic he did let me take one too. "
Trigger Warning with Killer Mike,"On the fourth episode, its pretty damn good and funny so far lol first episode he tries only living black meaning eating only food grown by black people, using products made by black owned companies etc. He ends up sleeping on a bench one night cause he cant find a black owned hotel or anything. El-P is also in this episode.

Second episode he tries to get black people interested in trade jobs by making educational porn lol 

Third episode he gets the crips and bloods to each make their own soda and they bring it to stores and get it on shelves 

Its pretty entertaining "
Trigger Warning with Killer Mike,"Huge fan of killer mike but this looks pretty lame.

Hopefully just a bad trailer."
Trigger Warning with Killer Mike,I can't take Killer Mike serious ever since the NRA used him for propaganda
Trigger Warning with Killer Mike,mike is awesome. went on tour with RTJ a few years ago. looking forward to seeing how this plays out. 
Trigger Warning with Killer Mike,"Huh, consider my interest piqued. Looks like Mike's spin on This is America

The name is trash though"
Trigger Warning with Killer Mike,pretty much nathan for you but with killer mike...sign me up!! the crip-cola thing is gonna be hilarious lmao.
Trigger Warning with Killer Mike,"I am pretty sure there are churches where Jesus is black, like the Ethiopian Orthodox.  "
Trigger Warning with Killer Mike,"^^^^^^^duped^^^^^^^^ 
More ""fake"" killer mike propaganda????"

Trigger Warning with Killer Mike,"That and they were on tour for like two years.  
  
El-P also did a movie score."
Trigger Warning with Killer Mike,"El-P actually said today they're starting work on it very soon, now that weddings, movie scores, and apparently shows are now out of the way"
Trigger Warning with Killer Mike,"Black people use Figgas lol. Do you think they filmed you for the first episode, where he only buys black?"
Trigger Warning with Killer Mike,He apologized for that and later endorsed the Socialist Rifle Association instead IIRC
Trigger Warning with Killer Mike,He is pro 2nd amendment but probably hates the NRA.
Trigger Warning with Killer Mike,"I literally learned about this minutes ago! My head is still spinning. I came here just to see if anyone would mention it so I knew I wasn't going fucking crazy. What the fuck is going on. They represent everything he has fought against. It's not like this is new information. The NRA has been an arm of gun manufacturers and a propaganda machine for years and years to fuel all the things RTJ raps about burning to the ground. Their rhetoric has consistently stood against those who speak out about police brutality. They're an organization that tries to sell guns by telling people to be afraid of people like him. They work against arming people of color. How the fuck did he not get that through his own head. I'm seriously considering deleting RTJ from my phone. 

EDIT: So he apologized and said that the NRA used the video ""as a weapon"". No shit dude, I respect that he realized he fucked up and they used him but come on. How did you not know that would happen? You can say your sorry but how did you not know that stove was hot. "
Trigger Warning with Killer Mike,wait u toured with them?
Trigger Warning with Killer Mike,the name sounds like a shitty Joe Rogan special where he commits a solid 10 minutes to complaining about Plus Sized Models or some crap
Trigger Warning with Killer Mike,"It's just dumb though. Premise is hells angels make a shit ton of money off there logo even though they're a criminal organization and they're WHITE. Laugh my muthafucking ass off. NOOOOO they don't, go buy a hells angels tshirt, that statement is hilarious enough but go have one made, and if you find someone stupid enough to do it wear it out but please wear a gopro when you do. Plus the fact if they're really crips they dont act like it in the video and highly doubt they'd be down for it. Just another spinster making money cause he saying your trigger words WHITE, PRIVILEGE, UNEMPOWERED. Guy is exactly what he claims to fight, propaganda whore. Enjoy!"
Trigger Warning with Killer Mike,ow the edge
Trigger Warning with Killer Mike,"based on that last quote with the lady talking about shootings and robberies, my bet would be on Mike being the most uncomfortable, moreso than ""old white people"""

Carmen Sandiego,"I remember playing this game on my girlfriend's Apple IIe computer back in 1985 and then making my parents by the Commodore 64 version for us to play at home.  It came with an Almanac to help solve the mysteries, but was also the copy protection for the game.  It would ask you to enter information from specific pages to continue the game.  Hard to believe that game turned into the global phenomenon that it has become."
Carmen Sandiego,The '90s cartoon was great! Carmen Sandiego was probably one of my earliest animated crushes haha.
Carmen Sandiego,"Greg Lee was the coolest adult when I was a kid. He even got to host a lot of teen events way back in the day. He was great when he guest starred on Ghostrider. By the way, DefuctTV is an amazing Youtube channel. He's currently doing a deep dive on the history of Epcot and Tomorrowland. It's fascinating!"
Carmen Sandiego,And I still have my T shirt I won by sending in a postcard! Somewhere I have a tape of my name being shown on an episode too.
Carmen Sandiego,"One of my all time favorite shows as a youngster.  The theme absolutly SLAPS.  I use to SCREAM at the TV when kids didnt  put the markers on the map at the end, like HUSTLE UP KID YOURE ON THE CLOCK"

Carmen Sandiego,"I never saw anyone find her on television, shit was impossible"
Carmen Sandiego,I'd shake my head any time someone won but didn't choose to go to Alaska or Hawaii.
Carmen Sandiego,This was such a great show! I remember all I wanted was that international radio. Radio stations from all over the world??😱i think it was a consolation prize too but it’s the only reason I wanted to get on there.
Carmen Sandiego,Good job John
Carmen Sandiego,I just realized why I as an adult love Jeopardy/trivia.
Carmen Sandiego,The aesthetic of this show actually kinda scared me as a kid. Maybe it was the mysterious music but it was a little too noir for me as a tot.
Carmen Sandiego,That was awesome! Thanks for posting.

Also, the theme by Rockapella was fantastic. As everyone knows."

Carmen Sandiego,"The game Where in the USA featured a snippet from [this song](https://youtu.be/lJOL7FcVths) that I later heard when I was getting into underground music.

Going through the playlist now there’s some damn good song selections. Borderbund ruled."

Carmen Sandiego,"I know! I honestly can't remember what I had to write on the card but I do remember being really upset that my postcard was just one of those plain white ones and I was upset I didn't have a fancy one to send. 

It was MONTHS after I sent it in that I won. I completely forgot about it until I got home from school one day and my mom was like ""You got a package and it feels like clothes."""

Carmen Sandiego,Ahh! I don't remember what picture was on my postcard but I know I wrote on it with green gel pen. Amazing what details we recall from so long ago.

Carmen Sandiego,greatest game/trivia show of my time!
Carmen Sandiego,Rockapella was awesome!
Carmen Sandiego,"There was a point in the 90s where PBS just was able to produce really good stuff for teens. I remember my afternoons for a few years I would watch Reading Rainbow, followed by Ghostwriter, then Square One, finally where in the World Is Carmen Sandiego. Greg Lee also deserves  much love cuz he really worked well as the show's host. I still remember the  episode they did when he guest starred on Ghostwrider.

 I hope the Defuntc TV does an episode on Square One cuz I mean what an amazing idea? A comedy sketch show about MATH aimed at teens! I know for a fact people on Reddit fondly remember the Mathnet series that aired on Square One."
Carmen Sandiego,"A kid from my elementary school got on that show, and when it aired the whole school cancelled classes to watch. He won, too."
Carmen Sandiego,The new animated series on Netflix is pretty good.
Carmen Sandiego,Can anyone confirm that she’s running a scam in Scandinavia?
Carmen Sandiego,"Growing up in San Diego, this helped support my 4 year old brain's confirmation bias that my world was the center of the universe. They made TV shows just for my city!

I also thought all Nissan cars fully named Mossy Nissans because that was the name of the local dealership.

Thanks for reading this useless info."
Carmen Sandiego,This show valiantly held the banner of *a capella* against a hostile and disdainful world.
Carmen Sandiego,"There's an easter egg in the new animated show for fans of the live action game show. In the recent-ish (within the last year) choose-your-own-adventure-style special, you get to use your remote to choose Carmen's next action. This makes for an extremely rewatchable story with dozens of possible endings (many of them fatal) and a few paths to complete success. 

The plot is oriented around Carmen needing to fulfill multiple tasks for the evil V.I.L.E. crime organization to rescue her two companions who are being held hostage in a grim prison cell. When you win the game, you get a post-credits scene where the two companions start beatboxing and then burst into the full acapella Rockapella classic theme song. Then every single other member of the animated cast joins in. It's absolutely delightful and my 8-yr-old was wondering why I was giggling delightedly through it all. 

Enjoy:

Carmen Sandiego,This show was a powerhouse.
Carmen Sandiego,I loved this show. I am pretty sure one of my very first cds was the soundtrack. No regrets.
Carmen Sandiego,"I loved it as a gamified educational IP, both as a PC game and a PBS game show.  Then they tried writing narrative cartoon shows around it and the charm vanished for me, even back in the 90s."
Carmen Sandiego,"The ending map run was nearly impossible. It wasn't the knowledge of the map that was hard, but the pylons were designed to be top heavy and fall over if they weren't placed just so. You had to have some NBA level agility and speed to do the map run even if you didn't make a mistake on knowing where each country was."

Carmen Sandiego,"[By the way, Where in North Dakota is Carmen Sandiego? is not a joke.](https://gamehistory.org/where-in-north-dakota-is-carmen-sandiego/)  That is a real game."
Carmen Sandiego,Did The Chief ever manage to catch Carmen San Diego and her supple breasts?
Carmen Sandiego,My greatest regret In life is never getting on that show
Carmen Sandiego,"It's strange that I remember watching it but don't remember it being on PBS. It makes sense that it did, I just don't remember it that way."
Carmen Sandiego,"I kept a notebook for following along with this show. I don't remember much about the show, but I was definitely into it when I was young."
Carmen Sandiego,Lynn Thigpen
Carmen Sandiego,"I wish I would have been into this show as a kid, but I had a weird disdain for PBS shows as a kid."
Carmen Sandiego,"I watched this show all the time at my grandma’s, her local station played it for an hour block every day. I also played the computer games, first time I heard “Robbin Banks”."
Carmen Sandiego,Jesus that just dredged up a lot of memories.
Carmen Sandiego,Screw Carmen! We get it bitch.....you get to travel for a living
Carmen Sandiego,I remember watching this every day after school. Then I got the computer game which was amazing.
Carmen Sandiego,"there was also a couple of cool planetarium shows that I saw in a few city's that had the people from this show

and then the spinoff where in time is carmen sandiego"
Carmen Sandiego,does anyone know where to watch these?  I have looked and can not find anything.  do these ever go on sale on eBay or anywhere to get these episodes?
Carmen Sandiego,I would play it in school too! It was awesome back in the day
Carmen Sandiego,"Double Dare is probably the greatest kids game show, but Carmen Sandiego was very close."
Carmen Sandiego,"> greatest game/trivia show of my time!

not to mention the song"
Carmen Sandiego,They were like 96% of the reason I tuned in
Carmen Sandiego,Hit it Rockapella!
Carmen Sandiego,"They're still going, though I think only one member of the current lineup was on the show back in the '90s."
Carmen Sandiego,"My favorite little bit of the show is when the kid wins round two, and you hear them sing:

“You won! Da da da da da da daaaaaaa!” with just so much enthusiasm and you can barely hear it because of all the applause but it’s just so emblematic of the sheer joy throughout the entire show, it’s amazing.

I think I was in that tiny percentage of PBS stations that didn’t air it, but I always caught it when I went to visit my family in NYC and it was so freaking special to me."
Carmen Sandiego,"Square one was my favourite show, and mathnet the best segment on it. Wish they'd do a dvd release."
Carmen Sandiego,"> here was a point in the 90s where PBS just was able to produce really good stuff for teens. 

It takes a little time for all those conservative 5% funding cuts each year to add up."
Carmen Sandiego,"Loved Square One, and watched 3-2-1 Contact afterwards most days."
Carmen Sandiego, wishbone and mr bean
Carmen Sandiego,"> I still remember the episode they did when he guest starred on Ghostwrider.

Oh crap, that was him playing the computer lab teacher in *Who is Max Mouse* wasn't it? I just realized that and I watched it not too long ago."

Carmen Sandiego,"When I was 4 I thought that rain was God's pee.

Thanks for coming to my TED Talk."
Carmen Sandiego,went to college in San Diego and still have random Mossy Nissan commercials pop into my head periodically
Carmen Sandiego,"There is a bunch of easter eggs. In one of the last episodes there is a violin concerto and the performer is playing Die Entführung aus dem Serail and Carmen mentions ""this is my kind of song""... which is funny because it was the theme song to the *Earth* series.

The writers of that show did a great job pulling things from the whole franchise."
Carmen Sandiego,"The contestants got even better on the map in the later years though as the show received a field that was way more familiar to the show than the early gumshoes, despite everything the producers had thrown in to make the final round even tougher by expanding the number of correct locations needed to win from 7 to 8 in Season 2 and adding bodies of water, national parks and monuments to the map in the later seasons.

Season 1 (65 eps.): 22% success rate

Season 2 (65 eps.): 23%

Season 3 (65 eps.): 26%

Season 4 (50 eps.): 46%

Season 5 (50 eps.): 36%"
Carmen Sandiego,"The map felt like it was designed like a carnival game, i.e. mostly made to not be won. It always seemed like people won it by chance, simply because if even just one or two locations were far enough way it all but guaranteed youd run out of time."
Carmen Sandiego,I vaguely remember watching a few episodes of Where in Time and it was never able to hold my interest for very long before I changed the channel to something else. I had completely forgotten about the show until I heard that terrible theme song.
Carmen Sandiego,"Once they showed it on the video, I vaguely remembered it.  I think my little brother was watching, but I was too old"
Carmen Sandiego,"The locale is so random though considering they already made games for USA, World, and Time."
Carmen Sandiego,"That swizzling swingbat, GREETINGS GUMSHOE"
Carmen Sandiego,The beautiful island of Virginia
Carmen Sandiego,"Well she was going to take her into her Acme Entertainment dungeon, after tying a rope around her and dragging her around a runway."
Carmen Sandiego,"She got really close, but BoneQueef ended up distracting Chief and helped Carmen get away, again."
Carmen Sandiego,I had a soft spot for PBS shows as a kid due to stuff like Reading Rainbow and The Magic School Bus. Funnily enough I think Reading Rainbow may have helped me get into Star Trek due to that one episode where LeVar Burton discussed his role as Geordi.
Carmen Sandiego,There's a bunch on YouTube!
Carmen Sandiego,"My ranking would be Legends of the Hidden Temple, Guts, Double Dare."
Carmen Sandiego,Not just the theme song but all the music in the show was great
Carmen Sandiego,Do it Rockapella
Carmen Sandiego,"Square One and Mathnet are some of my favorite TV memories as a kid

I live near the Mathnet station in LA"
Carmen Sandiego,"I remember theme song to 321 contact. https://youtu.be/B7S537b7saE

It was so epic. Which reminds me of another show these to do Newton's Apple which also had a pretty nifty theme song."
Kaguya-sama: Love Is War,I loved this dance 
Kaguya-sama: Love Is War,"Neeson:

>”No, I’m not,” Neeson said when asked if he’s interested in returning. “There’s so many spinoffs of ‘Star Wars.’ It’s diluting it to me, and it’s taken away the mystery and the magic in a weird way.”

>""It was nice to do that little bit with Ewan, after 25 years, 24 years. I appeared in the last episode. I had 2 lines to say, and it was cool and I loved it. But that's it."""
Kaguya-sama: Love Is War,Star Wars is being hurt by lack of direction and mediocrity.
Kaguya-sama: Love Is War,"The only Star Wars spinoff I've liked is Rogue One and Andor. 

Andor was one of those where I couldn't *believe* anyone was able to get the script approved."
Kaguya-sama: Love Is War,"I just don't understand why they insist only doing stuff from the start of the clone wars to just after the fall of the empire. Give me some Old Republic stuff like Mandalorian wars, the ancient sith lords, or the creation of the jedi order."
Kaguya-sama: Love Is War,Or maybe it's that the ratio of good to shitty movies/shows is like 1 out of 5 being generous.
Kaguya-sama: Love Is War,Number of spin-offs isn't the problem. Terrible scripts are.
Kaguya-sama: Love Is War,Liam Neesons though….
Kaguya-sama: Love Is War,"Honestly, the last movies were hideous in comparison with the spin offs."
Kaguya-sama: Love Is War,There's different camps of Star Wars fans. Original trilogy vs original 6 vs disney Star Wars
Kaguya-sama: Love Is War,"ITT: Lots of misdirected anger.

The guy is right, and there's nothing wrong with him saying so.

Edit: FYI, if you're writing me a five paragraph essay of fan drivel, I'm not going to read it."
Kaguya-sama: Love Is War,"I can see where he's coming from, but when your spinoffs (Mando, Andor) are considered better than the trilogy that recently came out, you gotta get behind what's still making you bank."
Kaguya-sama: Love Is War,They are being hurt from shit stories and terrible writers
Kaguya-sama: Love Is War,"He then closed out the interview by promoting his next film.

#Tooken 8: The Tookening"
Kaguya-sama: Love Is War,"He's not wrong.

It's why DC Comics tried to streamline things for new readers with The New 52, and then Marvel later tried the same thing with Marvel NOW!; when there's too much of something, people get fatigued trying to keep up with everything.

You could always say ""don't watch everything"" but that's not how the brain works."
Kaguya-sama: Love Is War,The “mystery” was taken away with “midiclorians “
Kaguya-sama: Love Is War,"Agreed. And he isn't saying all ""spinoffs"" are bad, which would be unsupportable (see: Andor). An overabundance of varying quality, definitely."
Kaguya-sama: Love Is War,"I mean I kinda agree 

Mainly if your content isn’t AAA maybe it shouldn’t be made 

Like bad batch is great but some episodes are kinda filler and think obi wan and boba Fett shows don’t need to exist"
Kaguya-sama: Love Is War,He should know. He was a part of the beginning of the end.
Kaguya-sama: Love Is War,He's right.
Kaguya-sama: Love Is War,Andor
Kaguya-sama: Love Is War,"Andor was ten times better than the last 6 movies.

I think it's the opposite.  The terrible movies are ruining the franchise.

Even bobba fett was better than the last few movies."
Kaguya-sama: Love Is War,"Wasn't he in the midichlorians Star Wars episode that literally removed the mystery of the force?

And didn't he have that bullshit story line about Anakin?  Ok, just checking."
Kaguya-sama: Love Is War,I agree with him for the most part. Andor was out of this world.
Kaguya-sama: Love Is War,"Hes right, but also....

Do another movie where your a grizzled old veteran that has to begrudgingly do one last job or save someone that's in trouble, and in the process you redeem yourself."
Kaguya-sama: Love Is War,Says the guy who did “Taken” and dozen other  of the same formulaic films of a guy seeking revenge.
Kaguya-sama: Love Is War,"I hate to break it to him, but the prequels diminished the value of the franchise."
Kaguya-sama: Love Is War,"Says the guy from: Men in Black International, Daddy’s Home 2, The Huntsman, Ted 2, Taken 1-2-3, Anchorman 2, Wrath of the Titans, The Chronicles of Narnia, The A-Team, Les Mis, Arthur the King, Excalibur, and I’m sure I’m missing a few spinoffs, remakes and sequels. He is well versed in running stories into the ground."
Kaguya-sama: Love Is War,Says the man in the first spinoff.
Kaguya-sama: Love Is War,Bro there’s too many Liam Neeson movies if anything. Three of them came out last year alone and I bet they were all basically the same
Kaguya-sama: Love Is War,"He's right. I used to really enjoy the movies occasionally. Even saw the prequels in theaters. Then they kept coming, one after the other and every dumb mother fucker in the world is out here trying to act like they are the biggest fan in the world. It got so annoying that I can't enjoy any of that shit anymore"
Kaguya-sama: Love Is War,It’s become the Empire
Kaguya-sama: Love Is War,I don’t mind the expanded universe of movies so long as they are not shit and lately the complaint is that the movies and spinoffs have been nothing but social justice shit.
Kaguya-sama: Love Is War,Totally agree
Kaguya-sama: Love Is War,"Yeah, sorry Liam, but nah. Projects like Rogue One, Mandalorian, Bad Batch, and Andor show that there is plenty of time for great stories in this universe. It's not an issue of to much content, but an issue of flying space Mary Poppins cameos of Princess Leia's reanimated corpse and Jar Jar Bigalow ""Mee-sa Senator now"" being regurgitated into the screen. The issue isn't volume, it's quality."
Kaguya-sama: Love Is War,"""Being hurt""?  


No, the damage was done a very long time ago. Now its more like kicking the pulverized remains of a long dead horse"
Kaguya-sama: Love Is War,"people here complaining about diluting star wars, sayin disney is at fault.

meanwhile i was reading these same stories in the 90s, in comic and/or novel form, because the star wars EU existed.

the only difference is now they are turning the stories into live action. hell episode 9, which i greatly dislike, is still very much Dark Empire from the 90s.

Fuck if they dont need to go ahead and make Shadows of the Empire into a live action series.

crime lords vs sith lords. lets go!"
Kaguya-sama: Love Is War,I happen to agree with Mr Neeson on this...
Kaguya-sama: Love Is War,Whatever made Andor happen - keep doing that.  Best Star Wars material out there.
Kaguya-sama: Love Is War,"Stars Wars succumbed to the Marvel-ization effect a while ago. I feel the same way about a new star wars IP as I do a new superhero movie: oh, ok."
Kaguya-sama: Love Is War,"“Star Wars” always struck me as a story about Anakin Skywalker and how he turned away from good and then was redeemed by the love of his son. 

That story has been told."
Kaguya-sama: Love Is War,"Well Star Wars fans have proven that they'll watch and like any old crap, so it doesn't really matter."
Kaguya-sama: Love Is War,I agree and also like the some of the spin offs.
Kaguya-sama: Love Is War,Space Jesus isn't wrong
Kaguya-sama: Love Is War,"Think the sequel trilogy did that, mate."
Kaguya-sama: Love Is War,When does Taken 6 come out?
Kaguya-sama: Love Is War,I think it’s diluting for me that Neeson has made multiple films with the same plot for the last 15 years.
Kaguya-sama: Love Is War,Clearly not a fan of Andor being better than his entire role.
Kaguya-sama: Love Is War,"No, it's been hurt by Disney having ZERO outline for the Sequel Trilogy.  Rian Johnson's Episode 8 was a mess, then Episode 9 was an abomination.  ""Somehow, Palpatine returned.""  

Say what you will about Geroge Lucas' writing skills, but ""Somehow, Palpatine returned.""  Is just about the most idiotic sentence in any Star Wars movie... scratch that, ANY movie where a villain came back for unexplained reasons."
Kaguya-sama: Love Is War,"I disagree, I think fleshing out the galaxy beyond the skywalker saga is a good thing.

I think people are conflating some of the quality issues of some of the content with the need for said content. I would prefer Disney spend more time curating quality Star Wars spin-offs rather than green lighting every half assed project, but I don’t think spin-offs themselves are the issue."
Kaguya-sama: Love Is War,Isn’t this the guy that shared screen time with JarJar Binks?
Kaguya-sama: Love Is War,"Respectfully, I disagree."
Kaguya-sama: Love Is War,Boooo … explore the Galaxy.
Kaguya-sama: Love Is War,"Yeah, well, you know, that's just, like, your opinion, man.

I think its fine, its more the varying quality that is the problem, not the quantity."
Kaguya-sama: Love Is War,"I have to disagree with him - especially when it comes to the shows.  For this IP or any other, it really comes down to the quality of what is being produced, not the number.  If it is good, then people will watch it.  For ***Star Wars*** specifically, the ""universe"" is so large I am enjoying the more micro looks into it."
Kaguya-sama: Love Is War,"Ehh sounds like an old man complaining bout kids on the lawn, I wanna see every story of that universe and now I can. Sure some are misses but at least they tried."
Kaguya-sama: Love Is War,Jar Jar.
Kaguya-sama: Love Is War,"I don't know, many people are actually liking some of the things they have done. Many spinoffs in the movie department were really good, like rogue one and solo, many were great successes like the mandalorian and andor. Fans love those (maybe some not so much at the start like it happened with the episodes one though three) but the misses on Disney plus have been much less, the bigger ones were in the last trilogy.

The only thing that really was going to hurt the brand was focusing entirely on the Skywalkers. Fans loved and live through the extended universe for years until they had some live action stuff again. And that was the beauty of Starwars how they could make different stories in the same universe not make everything about the same people all the time."
Kaguya-sama: Love Is War,It is funny because the spinoffs are the only thing that I enjoy.
Kaguya-sama: Love Is War,Yeah it started around 2001...
Kaguya-sama: Love Is War,"You were in one of those spinoffs, Liam! XD"
Kaguya-sama: Love Is War,"Yep star wars stopped being special a long time ago but there was money to be made so can't really blame disney for squeezing every penny out of it. If you could of told 12 year old me there would be multiple star wars tv shows and movies I would never be even quasi interested in, I don't think I would of believed you, but here we are."
Kaguya-sama: Love Is War,I mean...the movie he was in started that.
Kaguya-sama: Love Is War,"Hard to agree when Andor is hands down the best piece of starwars content out there.

I know people who don't watch any starwars content that loved Andor."
Kaguya-sama: Love Is War,"Yes, but I knew Disney was going to get that 4 billion they paid George Lucas for the franchise back and then some.

There was a video of a guy or someone freaking out when Star Wars Episode 49 or some such came out. I figured that was where it was going to go."
Kaguya-sama: Love Is War,Pretty sure midiclorines s/p are the ones that took the mystery away.
Kaguya-sama: Love Is War,I love Qui-Gon!
Kaguya-sama: Love Is War,"Lol. jar jar binks. There are only 3 star wars films, anything else ruins it."
Kaguya-sama: Love Is War,Wrong
Kaguya-sama: Love Is War,Wrong.
Kaguya-sama: Love Is War,"After reading the comments, I just wanted to say I enjoy the prequels; especially ROTS!"
Kaguya-sama: Love Is War,Honestly… Rogue One is the only Star Wars movie I like and would watch again.
Kaguya-sama: Love Is War,Oh please bring back the midiclorian bs…
Kaguya-sama: Love Is War,Humbly disagree.
Kaguya-sama: Love Is War,"I love Liam, but Star Wars shat that bed the first movie he was in. At first i was annoyed at them ruining my childhood. Then I realized I'm a grown ass man. Maybe it's ok that Star Wars don't cater to me as a grown ass man the way they did when I was a kid."
Kaguya-sama: Love Is War,Yep.  This cow has been milked dry
Kaguya-sama: Love Is War,"From the man, in the movie that gave us a boring genetic reason for jedi to exist."
Kaguya-sama: Love Is War,"No, because there was no more story to tell after the first trilogy."
Kaguya-sama: Love Is War,The damage was done with the prequels.
Kaguya-sama: Love Is War,"Yeah, fuck that. Andor was great. Rogue One was great. Keep them coming."
Kaguya-sama: Love Is War,No one tell him about where midichlorians came from
Kaguya-sama: Love Is War,"I feel like the original appeal was a rag tag group of filmmakers and actors got together to tell a story about a rag tag group of underdogs adventuring around space, with lots of space battles and laser swords. But it's grown so beyond that now that it's so exceptionally mainstream. That's probably why The Mandalorian and The Clone Wars are so popular among fans because they are the closest to capturing that spirit."
Kaguya-sama: Love Is War,"I love The Mandalorian and the original trilogy. I haven't seen Clone Wars or Andor yet. Otherwise, I think the franchise has been more misses than hits."
Kaguya-sama: Love Is War,"I think he has a point. Lot of garbage in the star wars universe. But there's some true gems. Andor is truly remarkable and if you love star wars, then this series acts as a love letter without unnecessary fan service. It's fantastic story telling within the star wars universe with compelling and interesting characters."
Kaguya-sama: Love Is War,That’s because he didn’t get a part in a good show. Like Andor…
Kaguya-sama: Love Is War,I swear I read this as Leslie Nielsen.
Kaguya-sama: Love Is War,“We have to explain the reason behind Han Solo’s last name.”
Kaguya-sama: Love Is War,"…He says from the set of Taken 13. /s 

But for real, they should’ve stopped after the prequels, at least there was a point to those ones."
Kaguya-sama: Love Is War,Isn't this one of the main criticisms leveled against the prequels when they came out? George Lucas has the same problem I do where he has too much anxiety when it comes to explaining things and so he over explains instead of letting the audience infer things. A big reason the first 3 movies were good was because of his ex-wife who edited them.
Kaguya-sama: Love Is War,-said a person who's never read a star wars book
Kaguya-sama: Love Is War,No its being hurt by idiots making the decisions and poor writing
Kaguya-sama: Love Is War,"If only Qui Gon had a young daughter that had been kidnapped whilst on holiday in Coruscant with her best friend, and then he had to use his talents to track her and bring justice to the evil ringleader of the trafficking gang. That would have worked as a spinoff series!!!"
Kaguya-sama: Love Is War,You mean bad star wars. Andor is a masterclass in how NOT to fuck up the universe. I say more spinoffs
Kaguya-sama: Love Is War,"True, I literally did not even care about the spin-offs only the main trilogy movies."
Kaguya-sama: Love Is War,"I totally disagree with Neeson here. If they made fewer Star Wars spinoffs they wouldn't suddenly be more magical. Instead of regular soulless cash crabs it would just be somewhat rare soulless cash crabs.

Hack writers and creatively bankrupt people don't magically become more talented by doing less work."
Kaguya-sama: Love Is War,"That's a very reductive take on what is a grand fictional universe ripe to tell many different kinds of stories in.

Lack of mystery and magic doesn't happen because of spin-offs, it happens because of unimaginative writers.

But there is a bit of truth to it, of course. You can't keep telling stories without chipping away at the mysteries of the IP. That's just how it goes.

However, I have never believed that to mean that more stories shouldn't be told."
Kaguya-sama: Love Is War,I've got the perfect solution: don't watch the spinoffs.
Kaguya-sama: Love Is War,He’s right and he should say it.
Kaguya-sama: Love Is War,"Well, I don't know. Maybe he has a point, but for me the reason it has been hurt has more to do with the lack of talent and vision, particularly in the sequel trilogy."
Kaguya-sama: Love Is War,10000% agreed
Memory Love,And Vince is back on the board as chairman.
Memory Love,"Cue ""no chance in hell"""
Memory Love,Vince spent his “cancelling” binging *Succession* and jotting down ideas
Memory Love,"For people not following the story closely here is the events:

1. Vince stepped down as CEO and head of creative last year when it was found he used company money to pay off sexual partners of his and John Laurinaitis who were former (or future) employees
2. HHH and Stephanie McMahon (husband and wife and Stephanie is Vince's daughter) were put in leadership positions after this change with Stephanie being co-CEO with Nick Khan who was involved in the business side of the WWE also being co-CEO. HHH was put in as head of creative a job which he held for many years in NXT the WWE's development brand
3. 2 weeks ago ish it was said that Vince was looking to come back but it was labelled as a rumour but Vince still controls a majority stake of the voting shares in the company
4. Vince installed himself as ~~CEO~~ chairman of the board again but the rumour was he was looking actively to sell the company, he had been talking about being open to offers on investor calls for the last at least 5 years and that was publically known. The potential buyers talked about were mostly the large US networks but the WWE also had a business relationship with Saudi Arabia and that was also suggested as a potential buyer
5. With this news of Stephanie resigning last night the rumour was that the PIF the Saudi investment fund has put in an offer for the WWE above asking price but it will still have to go to a board vote but it looks like the WWE will be taken private"
Memory Love,"Vince: IT WAS ME, STEPHANIE. IT WAS ME ALL ALONG"

Memory Love,Cue the exploding limousine?
Memory Love,A woman can't be ceo of a saudi owned company... allegedly
Memory Love,"Vince ruining WWE one day at a time.
When will he take back the lead over creative"
Memory Love,Rowdy Saudi Piper
Memory Love,Vince coming back is nothing but bad news for the WWE
Memory Love,Well that lasted 2 seconds
Memory Love,glass breaks - stone cold steve austin music - he atone cold stunners vince > pounds a beer > anounces he is ceo now. (thats how it would have happened if it was middle school)
Memory Love,"Stephanie resignation means something bad is going down at WWE behind the scenes.

With the old man Vince McMahon coming back to take over the business is a sign that the WWE is going into the wrong direction, Again."
Memory Love,"I assume most in here have no desire to watch or pay attention to wrestling, but the shit that is going on within the company right now is some of the most batshit insane stuff we’ll probably ever see."
Memory Love,Somehow Vince returned.
Memory Love,"Damn, WWE was churning out some good content since Vince McMahon has been gone. Some of the staff may be looking at keeping their CV's updated during this time."
Memory Love,Surprised nobody has mentioned how politically tied this is to their purchase by the Saudi Arabian Private Investment Fund
Memory Love,"I was big into WWF wrestling around 1999-2000 when one of the storylines was HHH and Stephanie meeting.  If I remember the storyline correctly Stephanie was supposed to get married to another wrestler, but then HHH got her drunk in Vegas and they eloped when she was passed out, and the footage was played during one of the matches.  Anynody else remember this?"
Memory Love,Vince gonna destroy what he created
Memory Love,It's all on hunter now uh. Nick and Vince will ruin everything .
Memory Love,Good for her. I hope Stephanie McMahon moves on to better work.
Memory Love,"Vince really came back and ruined it, damn."
Memory Love,"I'm a 55-year-old guy that remembers the WWWF on Saturday TV and all this makes me a little sad.  I can't pinpoint when I stopped watching the 'E, it may have been when they brought back Lesner once too many times or so many releases and then the old many FINALLY retiring only to come back.  

AEW has its demons, but maybe fans will see them as some kind of alternative.  Personally, I look at them like WCW in the 90's with a bloated roster and no real direction."
Memory Love,... Because we can't have a woman on the board of a Saudi company
Memory Love,"It's going to break my heart when Triple H resigns/gets fired. I hope this just ends up being a sabbatical until Vince finally dies, hopefully very soon."
Memory Love,It's almost as if the whole thing was planned.
Memory Love,Now Saudi Arabia bought the WWE.
Memory Love,Looks like the Saudi’s are buying them as well and privatizing
Memory Love,I guess the rumors about them selling it to Saudi Arabia’s investment fund are true after all….
Memory Love,Is this why the stock rallied this week?
Memory Love,"If the WWE being sold and going private rumors are true, what does that mean for the programming? Is there potential for a return to an edgier Attitude Era-like program style?"
Memory Love,"I guess the Iron Sheiks will laugh last after all, live long enough to see the villain become the new cartoon oligarchic overlords

WWTF"
Memory Love,"Dear Steph and HHH,
Please start your own promotion. 
Signed,
Hopefully more people than just me."
Memory Love,Why was she co-CEO? Why do you need two CEOs? Was it a gimmick?
Memory Love,She worked so hard to get there too! A pity.
Memory Love,Triple H drugged and married her against her will. Now what is he going to do now?
Memory Love,"It's been a while since I last watched WWE, but most of the antics of the McMahon family getting intertwined with the usual kayfabe leads me not to believe everything I see on set.

I guess that's why I stopped watching. I stopped believing the drama."
Memory Love,Well fuck……
Memory Love,Did she? Or is that written in the script.
Memory Love,She says she wants to spend more time not hanging out with her family and smashing half empty bear cans with her skull.
Memory Love,She’s so fine 🤤
Memory Love,[removed]
Memory Love,Oh no!..... Anyway 🥱
Memory Love,Saudi 's are buying WWE. Would have been better going to Tony Khan!
Memory Love,This low brow crap still exists? Lol.
Memory Love,Who did she harass?
Memory Love,[deleted]
Memory Love,"And, who cares?"
Memory Love,[removed]
Memory Love,"First he comes back, then he says he’s selling, now Steph is “leaving”. Are the McMahons really done with wrestling?"
Memory Love,"Welp, guess we're heading back to WWE going to shit if Vince is coming back"
Memory Love,"From what I gathered Stephanie is going to return with her partner shockmaster for  a no holds bared discussion at the Pontiac silverdome.  Also stating her father is a ""jabronie"""
Memory Love,"Vince steps in the middle of the ring to make his announcement.

*Glass shatters* and SCSA is walking down the ramp."
Memory Love,These people are just slop.
Memory Love,Feel like this is to make some certain people interested in buying happy.
Memory Love,I wonder if Triple H will be leaving with her.
Memory Love,Pretty sure the Saudis wouldn't like a woman as CEO.
Memory Love,Seems like the stage is set for his return.
Memory Love,"I mean he literally held the company hostage and said ""I will veto any TV deals and tank the profits for a sale unless you put me back in charge""

Fuck that dude, hostile take over of his own fucking company cause of greed and being a little bitch who can't keep it in his pants and see how that's a problem"
Memory Love,Apparently sold to Saudi Arabia now. Wow.
Memory Love,Looks like it’ll be Vince V Stephanie at Wrestlemania
Memory Love,"What is ""What are the chances he lets his kids take over the company?"""
Memory Love,“Here comes the monaaayy!!!”
Memory Love,"And out on dates with other women. I know he and Linda are no longer together but, at least file for divorce."
Memory Love,"He didn't install himself as CEO, he made himself Chair of the board. Nick Khan is still CEO."
Memory Love,"Awww, son of a bitch!"
Memory Love,"To be fair during that time Mae Young also gave birth to a hand on television. WWE at that time was completely about being crass. One thing that actually happened, for example, was Vince having wrestlers come out and beat the shit out of Steph.

Vince isn’t incestuous towards his daughter, he’s just a complete maniac."
Memory Love,What’s with rich dudes and being attracted to their daughters man
Memory Love,"The ""butterhead"" is getting a bit limp.    
As for her, it romaines to be seen whether she is happy with this or not.     
Next time he ceasar, if she acts like an iceburg, then we know they had a big aruglament and their relationship has taken an endive."
Memory Love,[deleted]
Memory Love,"Honestly once Vince dies, I really hope someone has the balls to do a legit documentary on his life. The funny thing is, alot of it will come off as fiction because of how ridiculous some of the confirmed stories about him are"
Memory Love,"Another thing you can add to this is that it’s basically being reported by every wrestling reporter now the company just got sold to the Saudis

So it probably did not go over well with her either"
Memory Love,Love that you linked Denise’s story. Watched her do independent ring announcing years ago. You could tell she was the biggest star on the stage that night. Future is bright for her!
Memory Love,Kerrmit also said the company is sold on r/squaredcircle. That’s the confirmation I need. Massive insider.
Memory Love,That Roman Reigns guy sure could use a push...
Memory Love,He has always seemed like a guy who would never ever be able to let anyone else ever run things.
Memory Love,Probably any minute now with this rumor sale to Saudi Arabia
Memory Love,"I watch youtube show that covers wrestling shows. They said this last Smackdown a few days ago was the worst in months, and they think Vince may have already grabbed some creative control."
Memory Love,Coincidentally the same amount of time I’d last with her. Badum tssss
Memory Love,[This](https://youtu.be/0Hk0QM1cP8w) was actually a storyline lol
Memory Love,What it sounds like is WWE was just sold to the Saudi's.
Memory Love,Yep
Memory Love,"iirc that was part of a plan to get revenge on Vince. Triple H agreed to divorce Stephanie if Vince could beat him in a no holds barred match or something. Vince basically gets in a position where he's about to deliver a knockout blow with a sledgehammer to Triple H, when Stephanie gets in the ring to ask if she can do it. Then she turns on Vince and it turns out it was all a plan to get revenge after he used her in that Higher Power thing. Might have misremembered some of that, it was a long time ago and didn't make much sense to begin with."
Memory Love,"she was set to marry Test, but it was all a ruse.

RIP Test"
Memory Love,She'll be All Elite.
Memory Love,"I dunno, this 38 year old Brit grew up as a fan of WCW and it makes me feel weird when people compare AEW to it because WCW was never as awful as AEW is as a TV show."
Memory Love,Yeah.
Memory Love,The rumour is it's being sold to Saudi Arabia. I have my doubts.
Memory Love,"He's Iranian though, would never show up again."
Memory Love,"Probably because she is more aware of the actual day to day and would be useful to someone like Nick Khan who is more is more of an expert on the business side of sports media. Not to mention you have a board, large investors, and it's a publicly traded company. You gotta do that balancing act."
Memory Love,"They needed someone that understands the wrestling business to run the company with the other CEO Nick Khan, who’s an outsider, and was brought in to maximize their profits to prepare for a sale."
Memory Love,Nope. It was eventually revealed that the drugged part was a ruse and she was in on it the whole time.
Memory Love,Check her Instagram
Memory Love,So that clueless idiot can completely bury *another* wrestling promotion through his sheer incompetence?
Memory Love,This snobby attitude still exists? Lol.
The Rising of the Shield Hero,"Funny how this sub defends politics in TV shows when it's their politics, but throws a fit when the other side's view is shown.

This sub wanks it like false rape accusations never happen, but the studies are all over the map on that one. And they like to use the lie that they're only 2% of such accusations (when the study they cite says it's anywhere from 2 to 8%)."
The Rising of the Shield Hero,"To anyone who hasn’t played TLoU2, just leave any TLoU thread. Too many people hint at stuff that’ll happen in the future in these threads."
The Rising of the Shield Hero,"So in the game I totally understood Joel’s POV. 

I was immediately onboard with the decision lol.

Not the killing part but the moral quandary was not one for me.

The lying though was a mistake.

In the show it was more disturbing because they really portrayed him as a mass shooter."
The Rising of the Shield Hero,"I like this statement:

>Good stories are not built on themes like “brotherhood” or “anger”; those are just words. Good stories are built on arguments: It’s worth killing everyone to save the person you love. We can debate that."
The Rising of the Shield Hero,Well Neil Druckmann did first when he wrote the game. Craig is just echoing that here.
The Rising of the Shield Hero,This guy was such a moron in the after the episode specials. Can’t listen to him at all.

The Rising of the Shield Hero,[removed]
The Rising of the Shield Hero,This is why I love the characters so much...they are layered. No one is the good guy or bad guy; everyone has reasons for doing what they're doing. Nuance makes for a great show!
The Rising of the Shield Hero,Omg it’s a tv show not a moral compass. My god can we not have anything?!
The Rising of the Shield Hero,Gonna be so thankful i got a teenage girl brain slurry vaccine when cannibal rapists chop off my legs or a bloater rips out my spine
The Rising of the Shield Hero,"Empathy is a double edged sword too. 

You can just as much empathize with a hobo as you can with a Nazi. 

We need to understand we are not infallible.  That our emotions are not truths. That our instincts are tools, not laws. That dogs trusting these same feelings can see children as threats and attack them. We are no different. 

But what we do after acknowledging...how we ACT on these principles is something neither Neil nor Mazen has yet to interrogate 

I'd like to see less critique and more attempts at solutions that promote dialogue."
The Rising of the Shield Hero,"That's a cool concept and all, but I'm not sure this is the right scenario to explore it because I don't think it feels nearly as grey as that would require. Nobody watching is going to be unsympathetic to the calls made by the characters here, or consider them ""negative"" expressions of love in any meaningful way."
The Rising of the Shield Hero,Joel entering the Avatar State to save Ellie.
The Rising of the Shield Hero,Thanks for the heads up
The Rising of the Shield Hero,"As someone who hasn't played the game, all of these discussion threads are so frustrating. Everyone constantly talking about what happened in the game. I don't care about the game, I'm just trying to enjoy the TV show."

The Rising of the Shield Hero,Bless you

The Rising of the Shield Hero,"Or you know, don’t frequent threads that might spoil things for you in the first place?

The games vs the show have very different fan bases. The show moves faster than the game. You don’t want spoilers?

Don’t watch the show until you’ve played the game. It’s that simple. 

Spoiler avoidance from game to show? Two completely different ball games. Do not make demands that can not be met."

But a lot of parents would go for the selfish option without even thinking of the impact it'd leave on their child.

Ellie now has the corpses of the potential saviors of humanity on her name. All while believing her immunity can't be for nothing. That's rough."
The Rising of the Shield Hero,"Ironic given that you kill A LOT more people in the game (because it's a fame, I understand thebseparation of media, just funny that it felt that way)"
The Rising of the Shield Hero,"> So I’m the game I totally understood Joel’s POV.
> 
> I was immediately onboard with the decision lol.

Yeah, first time I played the game... there wasn't a thought of sneak through the hospital. Like Joel, I killed everyone that was in the way."
The Rising of the Shield Hero,"You don't feel that way in the game because you've been mowing enemies for the past 16 hours of playtime by then. You're desensitized to the violence by that point. 

Joel has less action in the show, which makes the last scene more impactful. That's great writing to be honest."
The Rising of the Shield Hero,"He definitely was a mass shooter in the game, but when you’re controlling him you empathize. When he’s autonomous and you have to sit and watch him do it, you see it more objectively. It was fascinating for me how differently I felt about events as a player and a viewer."
The Rising of the Shield Hero,My friend said that it gave off school shooter vibes
The Rising of the Shield Hero,"I mean, I don't know – I'm not sure Tolkien would agree.

Heck, larger themes like ""loyalty"" and ""brotherhood"", etc. were a huge part of the driving forces in LoTR."
The Rising of the Shield Hero,"> It’s worth killing everyone to save the person you love. We can debate that.

I wish more people actually debated this right here instead of all the excuses about how what Joel did ""isn't actually that bad"""
The Rising of the Shield Hero,"This is what bothers me about tlou2 talk. It's fucking shallow as shit. People talk about it like it's exploring some deep theme. It's not. It's the basic premise of anylove story really. What would you do for love? What's interesting is not that ""from a different perspective, things are different!"" That's fucking basic. What makes love stories interesting is the individuals involved and their growth within the story. 

Murder is bad? Yes. This is a shit story. Violence begets violence? Yes, this is a base level concept that many stories use but builder deeper themes and characters on top to become great. TLOU2 is basic shit."
The Rising of the Shield Hero,I think this is just putting to bed the cope a lot of fans are feeling over certain scenes potentially being changed.
The Rising of the Shield Hero,Co-wrote*
The Rising of the Shield Hero,"The podcast is genuinely unbearable, he sounds incredibly pretentious."
The Rising of the Shield Hero,[removed]
The Rising of the Shield Hero,Joel is absolutely the bad guy in this situation. We understand and feel for him cause we are watching his perspective but if we watched an entirely different character up until they are brutally murdered by this stranger Joel at the hospital we’d absolutely look at him as the villain. He made a selfish (understandably) choice.
The Rising of the Shield Hero,"I'm not sure I understand the distinction you're making. I'd say The Last of Us 1&2 absolutely acknowledge and question the impact of how someone responds to their emotions/instincts, and the alternatives to acting off instinct or emotion. The games (and this first season of the show) are constantly questioning the morality of characters actions, especially when their reasons for acting may be sympathetic or instinctive.

What exactly is it you think this IP has critiqued that even has a solution? What has it not encouraged a dialogue for?"
The Rising of the Shield Hero,"I was taught this quite effectively in GCSE English in the 90s. We read a piece of prose about a military officer getting chocolate for his daughter on his way home from work during a terrible war in winter.

It was a wholesome, but boring, story.

After we'd finished reading it the teacher asked us what the ""snow"" could be. It was worded in such a way it wasn't obvious. Then they explained - he's on his way home from the Concentration Camps. The ""snow"" was the ash of corpses he'd ordered be burnt.

The story and it's allusions suddenly made MUCH more sense. It was a 'wholesome' story but with one hell of a fucking kick.

We were all stunned. This guy who we'd all decided was a wholesome dad going about his day and getting his sweet daugther a chocolate bar during this terrible war. Turned out to be a fucking Nazi Deathcamp leader.

It was a real eye opener and has stayed with me for 25 years."
The Rising of the Shield Hero,[Big ol' spoilers for The Last of Us Part 2.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf-nQUiD6_g&t=333s&ab_channel=Wisecrack)
The Rising of the Shield Hero,The game's fanbase has been arguing about it for 10 years now.  Is there a particular reason you think the show will be any different?
The Rising of the Shield Hero,"I thought Joel was straight-up evil in the finale, but you don’t think his actions were “negative?!”"
The Rising of the Shield Hero,">Nobody watching is going to be unsympathetic to the calls made by the characters here

Yes, that's called protagonist bias and some of the most interesting media being made lately is about confronting that and recognizing that other perspectives outside the one presented to you as the most sympathetic are just as valid. 

It's always interesting to me how many struggle with that while being simultaneously angry that the media confronting that... is about that. ""Why are they trying to tell me violence and revenge are bad?"" They shout as they miss the point entirely and defend Joel as if those he's murdered don't have equally valid lives and families.

That's not to say that those who want a shallow reading or story of good guys v. bad guys are wrong for wanting that but it does feel weird to be angry at the story for digging deeper.

EDIT: You deleted your reply so I'll leave my response here: 

>to possibly save a bunch of people who are essentially abstract concepts

But this again misses the point of protagonist bias.

You are asking the narrative to spoonfeed why someone should care about faceless people when the point is that you should care regardless.

The value of the cure is in its possibility, not its certainty. Life doesn't have value because you are told how and why those lives are sympathetic."
The Rising of the Shield Hero,"Highly disagree, >!there was an actual plan for the cure this time!< so fuck him and what he did"
The Rising of the Shield Hero,I’m sorry I don’t understand what you’re saying. Can you explain this to me again while not sounding like a psychopath?
The Rising of the Shield Hero,"It’s honestly so similar that it’s hard not to. 

Same thing happens with book adaptions except most people on reddit play games more than they read books. 

The last of us hbo subreddit has a show or game spoilers thread though if you want to be able to discuss in peace.

/r/thelastofusHBOseries"
The Rising of the Shield Hero,"For those who have played the second game, it’s next to impossible to even discuss the finale and what might be next with those who don’t know the story.

Given their context and details, the spoilers are nearly unavoidable. Easier to simply say nothing than even try to be vague or play dumb—which is it’s own kind of frustrating for fans wanting to talk about it.

Not sure how people will go in Season 2 without knowing some of the bigger plot points.

Though, if you do, props to you. It will be quite the feat."
The Rising of the Shield Hero,"They follow the game story dot for dot when making this story which isv extremely rare. It means you can actually join in the conversation with the players too. After all, the show is made for people who didn't play the game and that's pretty neat because now we're both enjoying the content. That being said .. I love 2 way more than 1 so buckle up!"
The Rising of the Shield Hero,"You know, having ADHD isn’t always great, but I forget things so easily I basically can’t be spoiled. 

That being said, so far as I’m aware, studies have shown spoilers don’t diminish the enjoyment of a piece of media."
The Rising of the Shield Hero,What?
The Rising of the Shield Hero,They do though? There’s not many show only threads but they are there.
The Rising of the Shield Hero,...they do have show only threads
The Rising of the Shield Hero,Rekt
The Rising of the Shield Hero,"I think it can easily be the morally right thing to do.

Murdering people who are already incapacitated is not morally right to me. killing the doctor is not a morally right thing either.

But I wouldn’t sacrifice a child to save humanity who has adapted to the new world order.

I would allow her to sacrifice herself though. That’s the other thing Joel is guilty of, but so are the fireflies."
The Rising of the Shield Hero,There are plenty of ethical arguments that what the Fireflies tried to do is horrible. Not saying its some settled debate but wouldn’t be surprised if other people with medical training wouldn’t be appalled by the operation itself and the way it was handled.
The Rising of the Shield Hero,"It's the cost of love. As a parent, I would do **anything** to protect my children. The love a parent has for their kids is so primal. I didn't understand until my first child was born. Something just switches in people."
The Rising of the Shield Hero,"No, what’s selfish is asking someone to sacrifice their “family” member just so your bloodline can continue"
The Rising of the Shield Hero,The game made it more of a “it’s you or me” situation. The show presented it as him mowing down crowd’s without resistance.
The Rising of the Shield Hero,"Right but you are killing them in your mindset and my mindset was completing the game. As you said, a function of the game is plowing down henchmen albeit with limited resources.

In the show, we get a stronger notion of how unhinged/determined Joel is when it comes to protecting Ellie. We also get a distinction on who it is he’s killing.

I don’t recall a point in the game where someone is sincerely begging for mercy and incapacitated. When they begged then it was either a cutscene or a ruse iirc. 

The weight of it just feels heavier watching it for me."
The Rising of the Shield Hero,"I would say, to amend Mazin’s statement, good stories are built around tension, and that can come in the form of inter-character tension, like tlou, or intra-character tension, like lotr."
The Rising of the Shield Hero,"Yea that seems like a nothing statement to me. It basically amounts to ""can you turn the themes of your stories and internal struggles of your characters into marketable taglines catered to people who engage with media on a surface level"".

Cause ""It's worth killing everyone to save the person you love"" is the absolute shallow end. It's what conservative preppers dream about when they buy guns."
The Rising of the Shield Hero,"Well, there was also the “destroy evil on middle-earth” part too haha but yes I agree."
The Rising of the Shield Hero,">I wish more people actually debated this right here instead of all the excuses about how what Joel did ""isn't actually that bad""

Lol, that is the debate. You feel differently than those people. You sound like you're just wishing everyone agrees with you tbh

This type of story is going to fracture opinions and split ideals. Some people will justify each action Joel made, not realizing it, seeing the lines he is crossing. Others will be horrified and want him to stop. Some will be cheering him on like he is dad of the year, and others will never look at him the same way.

It's a complicated story that has a ton of varied responses from viewers. That's it's strength imo"
The Rising of the Shield Hero,Isn't Druckmann listed as the only writer for the first game?
The Rising of the Shield Hero,neil is the sole credited writer for the first game
The Rising of the Shield Hero,"I loved it. It's refreshing to see the thought process of the creators. Not everyone's cup of tea I guess, but I don't see how he's more pretentious than anyone else deeply connected to a story would be."
The Rising of the Shield Hero,"Everyone in that hospital was actively conspiring to murder Ellie.  They weren't exactly innocent themselves.

Joel wasn't necessarily ""right"" but it's meant to be ambiguous and I do not understand why people act like it's black and white."
The Rising of the Shield Hero,">The game's fanbase has been arguing about it for 10 years now.

Eh. Ish. Like, people talk about it being morally complicated, but... it's not, really, it's more a bit of spice in the characters. Would anyone ever believe Joel might choose differently? People see it as something that humanises him far, far more likely than they see him as a monster for it. Would people have actually preferred he let shit play out otherwise? I doubt it.

And even if we go with the now clearer idea the cure would work, for example, how much of a difference that would make to this world isn't exactly clear cut. In making such a big deal of the human factional conflict and inevitable grimdarkness of everything in this world, and minimising the gameplay sections (ie the bits where we actually see how dangerous the infected are), the show has made the fungus a secondary problem, so the supposed stakes don't quite stand up. If everybody got immunised tomorrow, it would change very little for a long time."
The Rising of the Shield Hero,"I mean idk.. taking so many lives like he did definitely is bad but am I crazy for feeling like he was justified in doing so? I'm not saying it was right what he did or moral but I wouldn't go as far as to say that it was pure evil. They attack him and Ellie(loves her like a daughter) with stun grenades, knock him out with a rifle, say they are killing his daughter without her consent for a chance at a cure that might not even work and if he tries to go to her they will kill him. Everyone he kills minus the 1 doctor has ARs and are actively trying to kill him to stop him from getting to Ellie. Killing the lead surgeon who was defenseless was the only real issue I had with what he did. That and obviously lying about what happened to Ellie. Marlene would have eventually come after Ellie and was pointing a gun at Joel threatening his life.

If he had left and nothing positive came out of Ellie's murder(yes that's what it would have been) it would have haunted him to his deathbed and completely destroyed him that he didn't save her when he could have just like he didn't save his own daughter. I really believe the situation would have gone completely differently had the doctors given Ellie the choice and let her help Joel understand that this is what she wanted. He would have had closure and Ellie would have had agency over her decision. That and trying other alternatives before moving to something so drastic"
The Rising of the Shield Hero,There’s nothing evil about saving a little girl from being murdered. Joel did nothing wrong.
The Rising of the Shield Hero,"TIL defending your children is considered evil.

There’s a saying that eludes me right now, but it’s something like any parent would rather let the world burn than lose their child."
The Rising of the Shield Hero,"While I don’t think killing people is a thing I could do, I would never allow the use of a kid in the way they did either.

In the game the killing is far easier then actually seeing it in the drama though. 

Still there is no question in my mind that fireflies were wrong unless they specifically asked Ellie which they did not."
The Rising of the Shield Hero,Need a cure for the 2 groups of infected he ran into throughout a cross country expedition?
The Rising of the Shield Hero,It's more that people just outright post spoilers
The Rising of the Shield Hero,Are you sure it followed the game dot for dot??
The Rising of the Shield Hero,I hate spoilers. It takes the excitement and surprise out of watching a show.
The Rising of the Shield Hero,Then why is everyone bitching about spoilers?
The Rising of the Shield Hero,"I think it's fascinating because Ellie makes it pretty abundantly clear that given the choice, she would absolutely sacrifice herself and Joel knew that. To me, it's even doubly selfish that he *knows* what path she would choose and he took that choice away from her. And he *knows* what he did was wrong, otherwise he wouldnt have lied to her. Joel is a broken selfish man and it's engaging as fuck."
The Rising of the Shield Hero,"I feel like they knew they were going about this the wrong way too. By sedating her and immediately going for the surgery, they purposely robbed her of the choice so she couldn't say no, so they wouldn't have to put down a screaming child. That's absolutely monstrous, even if the outcome was a positive for humanity."
The Rising of the Shield Hero,"> But I wouldn’t sacrifice a child to save humanity who has adapted to the new world order.

I think that's an incredibly naive thing to say since you haven't lived through an apocalypse. Would people who think it's normal to see their loved ones killed by infected feel the same way as people who post on reddit from the safety of their own homes?"
The Rising of the Shield Hero,It's one thing if they were 100% sure they could make a cure out of killing her. But they seemed more desperate and clinging to the last illusion of hope they have. There is also the fact that the fireflies won't give the cure for free and will use it to gain power and replace the government.
The Rising of the Shield Hero,It’s more than just the bloodline of the ff it’s all bloodlines potentially
The Rising of the Shield Hero,You mean like mankind has been doing for millions of years with war? Hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians are offering their children up right now to try and preserve the tribe.
The Rising of the Shield Hero,"Most of the people he killed had assault rifles and were actively trying to kill him.  The only really ""unjustifable"" kill, at least onscreen, was the guy who tried to put down his gun."
The Rising of the Shield Hero,Retcon
The Rising of the Shield Hero,100% agree. They did great with that. Humanizing the enemy. It was impactful with the kid that Ellie paralyzed and Joel killed. Having him beg for his life and call out for his mom was brutal.
The Rising of the Shield Hero,"Yeah, and I don't mean to be overly-critical. I'm not a writer and I didn't study it, and sometimes these quotes are taken out of context."
The Rising of the Shield Hero,"> Lol, that is the debate.

No, it's a different debate. Instead of asking if it's morally right for Joel to doom the world to protect his family, instead the debate is switched to ""Joel was actually saving the world"" or ""Joel knew the cure wouldn't work!""

Stuff like ""the Fireflies mishandled the whole situation"" falls under the original debate. Things like ""Well the cure wasn't likely anyway"" is moving away from the original debate to just flat out saying murder is okay because the cure would fail"
The Rising of the Shield Hero,"Yes.

The Rising of the Shield Hero,"If you go by the game credits, Neil was in charge of the story and is credited as creative director and Written By, and Bruce Straley handled the gameplay side. If you go by what people online say, Bruce reigned in some of Neil's narrative choices to improve it to the story we wound up with in the final product. 

Where the truth lays? I don't know. But yes, Neil is credited as the sole creative contributor.

Edit - Not sure what I said to upset people; the credits are what they are."
The Rising of the Shield Hero,Glad you enjoyed it. Guess I just have a different perspective working in the film industry with these types. Wish we had heard more from the other co-creator who actually made the game.
The Rising of the Shield Hero,"No one’s acting like it’s black and white and being a bad or good guy is completely subjective. In the story that’s being told here Joel essentially took away the chance to have “literally” saved humanity because he couldn’t handle losing Ellie. His actions are absolutely understandable but he still fucked over others to have his way. The hospital/fireflies weren’t conspiring to murder Ellie, what a dumb and absolutely ridiculous way to phrase them trying to make a cure that could save mankind. Putting aside whether it would work or the logistics of it the point is they had noble means and Joel is the opposite. His actions were selfish and could have ultimately doomed the world. It’s not black and white but he’s absolutely “narrative term here” the bad guy in this situation and even by saying that I understand his motivations and actions. You can still root for and respect the bad guys actions. It’s not at all ambiguous, it’s a moral debate. I don’t think you understand the term ambiguous."
The Rising of the Shield Hero,Why the downvotes?
The Rising of the Shield Hero,"> Would anyone ever believe Joel might choose differently?  

That's not the question posed, it's whether Joel was justified in his actions or was he completely and unwaveringly selfish or even both. You're not supposed to question whether he should've made a different decision (I don't think he ever would and that's why in the game you aren't given the choice) but question whether he is justified in his actions (which I do not)."
The Rising of the Shield Hero,"I don't have much sympathy for the Fireflies at all for the reasons you give, but also because I have zero confidence in them to actual accomplish anything. They are NOT a competent resistance group, the Fireflies and I have no faith in their ability to generate a cure. Even if they managed to, how would they distribute it?

Killing the surgeon was easily the most questionable thing Joel did (and certainly will come back to haunt him depending how close they follow the second game in the future), but frankly, the surgeon was something of a dumbass. I was laughing at the guy when he was put down.

""How did you get in here?""

He just did a John Wick and slaughtered all your mooks. Did you not hear the gunfire?

""I won't let you take her!""

Again, he just took down a dozen guys and is here with a gun. You're giving his daughter to him or...oh, never mind, he just shot you."
The Rising of the Shield Hero,"I gotta agree, have you ever seen anything about a game called Lisa: The Painful? Similar premise, but I feel it does a better job with the toxic love question. While also giving the daughter character agency to maker her own choices"
The Rising of the Shield Hero,"he only slaughtered countless men, including several that were trying to surrender and pleading for their live. He shot the doctor in the head without flinching, when he didnt have to. He shot and killed Marlene, who was also actively trying to reason with him. 

""nothing wrong"" lol"
The Rising of the Shield Hero,"You're insane if you really think that 

Like I get rationalizing Joel's act because you love Joel but saying he did NOTHING wrong at all is just outright evil shit."
The Rising of the Shield Hero,And he robbed countless of lives from being saved and cured with a vaccine.
The Rising of the Shield Hero,"Evil is a strong word, but everyone is the hero of their own story and the villain in someone else's. Loads of people aren't going to give a shit how much Joel loves Ellie (who they would happily point out is not actually 'his'), while their own children and millions of others are dying. To them he is the bad guy. Maybe even evil."
The Rising of the Shield Hero,"People think crossing an arbitrary border to save your child's life is evil, why the surprise here?"
La Grande Chaumière Violette,"I'm just glad to hear anything get ordered by network TV honestly. I know it's far from the king of the medium anymore but I still think there's a value to the 22 episode season and the rhythm of the network schedule. So I'm rooting for any network series. I'm especially glad to see networks investing in comedy series, the network sitcom (outside of CBS) felt like a dying breed especially with ABC consolidating all of their remotely successful sitcoms into one night and FOX practically abandoning the format"
La Grande Chaumière Violette,"There is a lot of comfort in 22 episode shows.

There’s just that security that you know when something will be on and it will always be on. 

Not a fan of waiting god knows how long for that release date announcement. But with this I can be like “Ah September/October, nice.”"
La Grande Chaumière Violette,Yes! Am definitely here for La Brea and American Auto. Grand Crew sounds interesting too.
La Grande Chaumière Violette,"If the streaming-era of sitcoms looks like Space Force, then may the networks last a thousand years."
La Grande Chaumière Violette,"I've recently heavily come around to that, and to the weekly release schedule being a thing on streaming services.   


I thought netflix's binge watch was better because I could watch it at my own pace (usually in the course of 2-3 days after release), but in Covid times its comforting to have something to look forward to each week for a few months."
La Grande Chaumière Violette,"Space Force to me was a show that would have benefited from a 22 episode network schedule. In my opinion it needed more time to breathe at the beginning and some more ""just for fun"" type storylines/episodes later in the season"
La Grande Chaumière Violette,They slapped that together with zero forethought.
La Grande Chaumière Violette,"> L'amica geniale

It has an English title that people know. Why are you like this?"
La Grande Chaumière Violette,"tl;dr?

2017 - Quite a few big budget/big name shows that we rarely ever talk about today.

2018 - I was doing a lot of online gaming this year... but let's be honest, it was a pretty weak year compared to the previous 5 years.

2019 - One of the hardest decisions I've ever had to make."
La Grande Chaumière Violette,"Just FYI, this is not ""listing"".  🙂🙂🙂"
La Grande Chaumière Violette,"2017 - twin peaks: the returnnnnn

Also not a fan of demon slayer tbh"
La Grande Chaumière Violette,"I'm always gonna put the original titles. lol. And this title is easy to memorize bruh, it's Italian not Japanese. 😅"
La Grande Chaumière Violette,"Many people here do not live in an English-speaker country, so they're much more familiar with La casa de papel, Dix pour cent and L'amica geniale than Money Heist, Call My Agent and My Brilliant Friend."
La Grande Chaumière Violette,"Lmao, didn't even ""list"" them in your TLDR.     Nothing wrong with what you wrote(I image, I didn't read most of it), just not titled so the reader knows what to expect."
La Grande Chaumière Violette,lol bruh. a listicle with words in between each selection is still a listicle.
La Grande Chaumière Violette,"Guy put a lot of effort in this post, and you are complaining because he didn't just post a low-effort list? And you guys are even downvoting this?

This sub disgusts me so much. I also have experience with making long and detailed posts that I put a lot of care into, and getting downvoted to oblivion..."
La Grande Chaumière Violette,"You said you were ""listing""."
La Grande Chaumière Violette,Sorry.    I don't know what came over me.    I apologize.    No sarcasm.
La Grande Chaumière Violette,"🤦 *jesus christ, the users on this subreddit never cease to amaze me*

I AM LISTING! Listing isn't just limited to 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Having a summary for each thing that you listed, is still *listing*!

This post, it's a list! My pinned ""Top 25 TV shows of 2021"" post, it's a list! Those Buzzfeed articles telling you the 10 best books to masturbate to in the summer and whatnot, they're lists!"
La Grande Chaumière Violette,It's ok now. You seem sincere.
La Grande Chaumière Violette,😂😂😂🥳
La Grande Chaumière Violette,What We Do in the Shadows is the best new comedy in ages.
La Grande Chaumière Violette,"Succession, Chernobyl, white lotus"
La Grande Chaumière Violette,"Ted Lasso,  Succession, A.P. Bio .. there's quite a few out there."
La Grande Chaumière Violette,"Corporate, I Think You Should Leave"
La Grande Chaumière Violette,"1. Kingdom - The film was disappointing
2. Vinland Saga
3. Chernobyl
4. Succession
5. Fruits Basket (2019)
6. Squid Game
7. The Boys
8. When They See Us
9. Invincible

A bit of a mixed list. I started to try more Korean series and they are pretty good."
La Grande Chaumière Violette,The Other Two is top tier
La Grande Chaumière Violette,"Succession, mare of East Town, Ted lasso, the boys, Yellowstone, Dave, perry Mason, altered carbon, the righteous gemstones, marvelous Mrs Maisel, dead to me, you, watchman, chernobyl"
La Grande Chaumière Violette,"What we do in the shadows, reservation dogs"
La Grande Chaumière Violette,"Succession is my current favorite, can't wait for Season 3!"
La Grande Chaumière Violette,"My Brilliant Friend isn't a miniseries. There were 2 seasons and a third will be broadcasted sometime early next year, I'm hoping for this year. There are more seasons to come to going by the books. The show is ongoing and is not over yet."
La Grande Chaumière Violette,Loved **My Brilliant Friend** and **ZeroZeroZero**
La Grande Chaumière Violette,I wanted to like Succession but was really put of by the shaky cam from episode 1. Is it worth me trying again? I coped with 2008 and I promised myself never again.
La Grande Chaumière Violette,"Sex Education, hands down."
La Grande Chaumière Violette,"I know it only started last week, but I'm blown away by Foundation. I've watched it 3 times this week."
La Grande Chaumière Violette,"Looking through my past few top 10 lists: Haunting of Hill House, My Brilliant Friend, Pose, Watchmen, Ramy, For All Mankind, Mrs. America, Devs, The Circle, The Queen's Gambit, Zoey's Extraordinary Playlist, The Mandalorian, The Good Lord Bird, Reservation Dogs"
La Grande Chaumière Violette,Pen15
La Grande Chaumière Violette,What we do in the shadows is a hidden gem. Filmed like the office but with vampires. Pretty entertaining.
La Grande Chaumière Violette,"Primal, Ted Lasso, Every single marvel show, The Mandalorian."
La Grande Chaumière Violette,Derry Girls. Scenes from a Marriage. Ted Lasso. Crash Landing on You.
La Grande Chaumière Violette,I think it's a great thread
La Grande Chaumière Violette,Hands down. The whole ensemble is fantastic.
La Grande Chaumière Violette,HBO gang!
La Grande Chaumière Violette,White lotus was terrible
La Grande Chaumière Violette,"Yeah, Corporate really doesn't get mentioned enough.  One of the better Comedy Central shows in quite a while. Good to see someone else liked it too."
La Grande Chaumière Violette,"I'm sorry about that it's a typo. 😅 Obviously some copy and pasting was done here. As you can see I put ""2 seasons (ongoing)"" and still for some reason have ""miniseries"" beneath it. My bad lol."
La Grande Chaumière Violette,Crazy how these two are so different and yet they are also on some of the best shows I saw in 2020-21. I stumbled across Brilliant Friend on a work trip in the hotel room and ZeroZeroZero led me to Gomorra which was probably my favorite of the three.
La Grande Chaumière Violette,💕
La Grande Chaumière Violette,I found that really annoying and distracting as well. Sometimes I was on the verge of motion sickness and had to take breaks. But either I got used to it or it stopped/decreased because I can't remember being bothered by it throughout and I made it through both seasons.
La Grande Chaumière Violette,Definitely Primal. Hard to believe how good it is honestly.
La Grande Chaumière Violette,Did you watch the 3rd episode?
La Grande Chaumière Violette,The prevailing theme I've seen with this attitude is that it's usually from the kind of people White Lotus was satirizing.
La Grande Chaumière Violette,"If that is true, perhaps some people don't like seeing themselves portrayed harshly again and again and made to feel shame."
La Grande Chaumière Violette,What kind of people would that be? I’m a Black woman with a working class background.
La Grande Chaumière Violette,I am pretty sure that Death Note does not have 11 seasons
La Grande Chaumière Violette,We're back to having tv channels
La Grande Chaumière Violette,"Have all these departures been officially announced?  

 I am glad Halt and Catch Fire and Rectify are not on this list."
La Grande Chaumière Violette,">Paramount+

wtf is this? first time i hear about it"
La Grande Chaumière Violette,This is why used to use VPN for Netflix before then blocked them all. You guys have so many tv shows we don’t here in Scandinavia.
La Grande Chaumière Violette,That’s good to know; just decided to re-watch Nurse Jackie a few days ago only to realize it won’t be on for much longer. Damn it!
La Grande Chaumière Violette,"The appeal to Netflix for me was always that they had a mix of shows I liked to rewatch and a good amount of original content that was largely good. Now they're losing most of the licensed content (a lot of shows I like are already gone) and their track record with original content is mediocre, made worse by their quick axe with shows.

They're becoming the most expendable streaming service to me. The one I don't need to have all the time."
La Grande Chaumière Violette,Good thing I have the internet
La Grande Chaumière Violette,"Damn, I was about to finally watch The West Wing."
La Grande Chaumière Violette,"> High profile

> Friday Night Tykes

What."
La Grande Chaumière Violette,If only this meant we could get The Last Kingdom s3 and s4 on Netflix...
La Grande Chaumière Violette,"I find it interesting the second or first most binged show two years running isn't moving

I guess Netflix won't be going to hell..."
La Grande Chaumière Violette,I've only seen two of these shows. None of the other shows interest me so I guess I am lucky!
La Grande Chaumière Violette,"> Netflix Canada

> Friends (Seasons 1-10) : moving to Crave

> The Office (Seasons 1-9)

> The fresh Prince of bell-air (Seasons 1-6)

Actually, The Office is staying put for now and it is Gossip Girl in fact that's leaving Netflix over here in the North."
La Grande Chaumière Violette,I started Gran Hotel on Wednesday but I don't think I can watch 60+ episodes in the next week!  Hope it moves to Hulu.
La Grande Chaumière Violette,"Yeah what the duck. Unless one season consists of 3-4 episodes

The anime has 37 episodes in total and it's all labeled as one season and there are few live action movies including a western one which failed."
La Grande Chaumière Violette,Not having ads and choosing what to watch is a huge plus though
La Grande Chaumière Violette,"We were never not going to have that. When we complained about cable it wasn’t because they asked us to pay for content we wanted. It’s because they also forced us to pay for content we didn’t want. I was paying thirty bucks a month for four ESPN channels I never ever use. I don’t want that.  I don’t have to pay for that without cable, which is great. But “I’m gonna get all the content in this entire world for 12.99 a month” is kinda unreasonable."
La Grande Chaumière Violette,"Time to buy a 3TB hard drive and work on the only channel that matters, a Plex server"
La Grande Chaumière Violette,"People wanted the ability to just pay for what they watch, right? Well here you go."
La Grande Chaumière Violette,"Except the ""TV channels"" have everything available immediately and you can cancel anytime. Seems like a pretty major difference."
La Grande Chaumière Violette,[deleted]
La Grande Chaumière Violette,"This are all officially announced, but the bad news is what i listed is probably only 1/10 or 1/15 of what will be leaving Netflix soon."
La Grande Chaumière Violette,"For the ones on Netflix France at least, you get a warning when playing them. So that's sure for those. I assume the others are the same"
La Grande Chaumière Violette,"New name for CBS All Access, they're rebranding"
La Grande Chaumière Violette,Some still work like Expressvpn
La Grande Chaumière Violette,I completely agree.  I regularly unsubscribe from Netflix for months at a time to save a few bucks until something I REALLY want to watch starts up.
La Grande Chaumière Violette,For a minute I thought it was a typo for Friday Night Lights!
La Grande Chaumière Violette,"Wait, you don't? Where are you? I thought they carried that everywhere."
La Grande Chaumière Violette,"Damn that sucks man, the last kingdom is awesome. That’s a shitty situation I’d be pretty irritated."
La Grande Chaumière Violette,What show
La Grande Chaumière Violette,You're only obligated to a monthly payment and can cancel anytime which is a huge plus as well. If the streaming services ever change this model that is when we go back to tv channels but without commercials.
La Grande Chaumière Violette,[deleted]
La Grande Chaumière Violette,mine is up to 67tb :)
La Grande Chaumière Violette,"> we don't have a single place to go to get the back catalogues like we used to 

We never had this."
La Grande Chaumière Violette,"Netflix had to start creating their own content because the other networks were already pulling content. They were proactive to the changing market, not the cause of it."
La Grande Chaumière Violette,Dam it’s getting really hard to keep up with all these streaming services
La Grande Chaumière Violette,"Nordics. The Last Kingdom was on SVT (public television) here in Sweden back in 2018, however since then you cant stream it anywhere as SVT only carries the episodes on their streaming site for a few weeks. Its very strange how Netflix hasnt gotten the rights yet"
La Grande Chaumière Violette,Lucifer
La Grande Chaumière Violette,"I get it, we are past the exciting new part of streaming, but I feel like so any people forget how worse cable truly was. This is a great point"
La Grande Chaumière Violette,"The cost is vastly lower and you can cancel whenever you want, jump to another streaming service and watch their content too."
La Grande Chaumière Violette,Need 2 more TB
La Grande Chaumière Violette,"They’re mostly done a bad job of naming themselves, despite fairly obvious choices.

* Disney+ is *fine.* “Disney” possibly would have been better.
* HBO Max. You could say it should be “HBO,” but HBO is a premium brand yet they’re using it as a service name for all Warner Bros.' shows and movies. “Warner Bros.”  or “WB” would have been better, with “HBO” as a tab within that. No need to dilute HBO’s existing cachet.
* CBS All Access should just be CBS. Paramount works fine, but calling it Paramount+ just looks like they’re a wannabe Disney+ (which they are). The Paramount Channel, maybe.
* Peacock is an awful name. Most people don’t know that NBC’s rainbow logo *is* a peacock. Again, just call it “NBC.”
* “Apple TV” is probably the only option they had, since they’ve moved away from “iMovie”-style names and it mostly has TV shows, not movies, but it creates confusion between the streaming service, the physical box you hook up into your TV, and the app that acts as a portal to all (non-Netflix) video."
La Grande Chaumière Violette,"Easier to keep up with it if most of them aren't releasing in my country. Netflix, Prime and Disney and that's about it I guess.

edit: forgot Apple+"
La Grande Chaumière Violette,"Bizarre! Sorry to hear that, though -- I hope they make some changes soon for you all."
La Grande Chaumière Violette,"All that - plus you actually choose to watch what you want, when you want. The ability to watch Fuller House never stops you from watching The Office."
Back with the Ex,"This all sounds good to me.

I like *Yellowstone* but I feel like it's about run its course, and the spinoffs are all better anyway.

And the last two times Costner got behind the camera for a western, we got *Open Range* and *Dances With Wolves*, both fantastic films.

*Horizon* already shot Part 1 last year.  The cast is crazy ... Costner, Sienna Miller, Luke Wilson, Sam Worthington, Thomas Haden Church, Jena Malone, Michael Rooker, Danny Huston, Will Patton, and more.

A 4-part epic Western spanning a 15-year period before, during, and after the Civil War, directed by Costner, starring Costner, co-written by Costner, for a movie he's been trying to make for nearly 20 years.  Sign me up."
Back with the Ex,"> The main cause of the need to cancel the show as it stands is believed to fall at the feet of star Kevin Costner who has been in dispute with the studio regarding shooting schedules. Sources reportedly told Deadline that Costner only wanted to shoot for 50 days for the first part of the latest season, despite originally stating he would work for 65. **For the second batch of episodes, the actor told the production staff that he would only be making himself available for one week of shooting**, due to prior commitments on his multi-part epic western film Horizon, on which he is starring, directing, and co-writing alongside Jon Baird for Warner Bros. and New Line.

This is just absurd. How does he intend to film 6 hour-long episodes in just 7 days?"
Back with the Ex,"Now we're hitting real '90s nostalgia, Kevin Costner being an egomaniac and betting it all on a disastrous-sounding Western epic."
Back with the Ex,"My predictions for Horizon:

$250 million budget

Costner plays a cowboy who has to deliver mail in a world covered in water due to climate change

He rides a government Dolphin

He drinks piss"
Back with the Ex,"Just kill off his character, it would make narrative sense as he’s already been shot numerous times"
Back with the Ex,"Make the 6666 show with McConaughey...he won't even have to leave Texas for it. 

Also I really really hope the character Jimmy is part of it. He is one of the better characters on the show."
Back with the Ex,"would be funny if they cancelled it but made a new show with most of the same cast just to end there deal with peacock, I know that amazon also has it in some country's that  have paramount plus"
Back with the Ex,". McConaughey would  be amazing.

Ranch takes on a partner to survive...Cousin Dutton."
Back with the Ex,You’d think with Better Call Saul having ended that he’d have plenty of time in his schedule for multiple projects now.
Back with the Ex,Costner's tanking the most popular show on television so he can concentrate on his passion project? That rules. Nothing but respect.
Back with the Ex,"All right, all right all right"
Back with the Ex,I want a 2050 with McConaughey
Back with the Ex,"I enjoy the show for the most part, but damn does Beth get annoying as fuck. She needs a good kick in the ass to get her off that high horse shes always riding."
Back with the Ex,Are they gonna go to war? Declare war on each other? Go to war with war and then declare war on that war when they goto to war again? Never seen the show but that seems to be a theme from the commercials I've seen about this series.
Back with the Ex,Just cast Bob Odenkirk and no one will notice
Back with the Ex,I have no interest in the flagship show set in modern times but 1883 was great and 1923 is also very good so far.
Back with the Ex,"Good. This show has run its course 

5 seasons is a good run"
Back with the Ex,"I get Costner wants to direct, but Yellowstone is the biggest thing he's been involved in since the 90's. I don't see this movie turning him into a major movie again at the age of 70.

The show is probably near the end of its run anyway. If he only wants to do a week of filming then put him in one episode and have him catch a bullet and be in a coma for the rest of the season.

I'm not sure how well that would work though, I only just recently finished season 1."
Back with the Ex,"Hollywood rewarded Costner with a (in my opinion, unworthy) Golden Globe and all the studio got in return was a series cancelation because of their lead actor's massive ego.

Even if Costner was bluffing, how much of an asshole do you have to be for the studio to just cancel your show instead of taking your bait? 

This must have been a long time coming."
Back with the Ex,I'm fine with that. This past season was very boring and felt like a filler season.
Back with the Ex,"It better be good if MMcC is starring, and he should get a billion to do it. His True Detective season was best performance in the world"
Back with the Ex,Just kill him off and let the brothers and sister tussel. So many good characters
Back with the Ex,Is this show actually good? Whenever I walk past its just guys shouting in fake low voices.
Back with the Ex,"I get why it’s popular- it fills a niche for a large audience that hasn’t had representation for a long time, but it genuinely a trashy show. It’s a right wing soap opera."
Back with the Ex,2055
Back with the Ex,Ah crap
Back with the Ex,2083
Back with the Ex,"Is this show good? From the few things I've seen, looks like a soap opera for republicans"
Back with the Ex,Money grab says wut?
Back with the Ex,it's ironic that a show that pretty much solely caters to conservative Boomers is lead by a pretty liberal guy and will be continued to be lead by an even more liberal guy in McConaughey
Back with the Ex,This has been on for 5 seasons?
Back with the Ex,How do I block any and every mention of this show from my social media?
Back with the Ex,"eh,the show died after republicans decided to make it political,like they do everything else"
Back with the Ex,It’s days like these that I feel fortunate not to be *that* old.
Back with the Ex,This show has gone on too long anyways. Half the episodes are just filler
Back with the Ex,It BEHOVES paramount to get this shit on their streaming platform instead of peacock and some cable channel only olds have
Back with the Ex,"I mean I see it ending and it's not something I would be against with tbh all good things come to an end, better to have a good ending"
Back with the Ex,Didn't he say before that he loves the show and will keep doing it as long as they keep making it??
Back with the Ex,Yellowstone needs at least one more season to wrap it up without fans being disappointed.
Back with the Ex,"I agree with 1883 being better than Yellowstone. That show felt real,  dangerous, wild and felt a sense of hope that drives people to do crazy things."
Back with the Ex,"Wow, I'm more excited for Horizon now"
Back with the Ex,"Open Range is by far one of the best modern westerns out there. 

Now you’ve got my hopes up."
Back with the Ex,"Micheal Rooker and Thomas Haden Church in a western together again? It really is the 90s! For those that don’t know, they were both part of the amazing cast that made up “Tombstone”."
Back with the Ex,The film sounds great.  Still its a rocky way to end a relationship on one of the biggest shows on TV.
Back with the Ex,That sounds so much higher value than more Yellowstone.
Back with the Ex,That’s one of the weakest “crazy casts” I’ve ever seen. Sam Worthington is only one that’s really relevant and he actually isn’t despite the popularity of Avatar.
Back with the Ex,what do you mean 4 part?
Back with the Ex,">the last two times Costner got behind the camera for a western, we got Open Range and Dances With Wolves, both fantastic films.

You forgot about The Postman"
Back with the Ex,"Yeah!! this seems like fantastic news! Costner doesnt have decades of time left on earth and needs to prioritize this extremely much more important Western project.

Hope he told Sheridan he needs to end this stuff asap and spin off"
Back with the Ex,"He doesn’t. He’s either going to force them to write his character out early, or Paramount is going to have to push back the entire second batch of episodes by a half a year or more so he can shoot multiple episodes worth of material. The latter isn’t going to happen, it would cost Paramount an absurd amount of money to reorganize the entire shoot that’s already gearing up. That means Sheridan’s probably rewriting the whole second half of the season right now, planning on killing off Costner’s character early and having the final episodes deal with that. Probably a good chance Sheridan is also rewriting to fit in McConaughey’s character for the spin-off, too, with him jumping on board for a prominent guest role before the finale."
Back with the Ex,By not being in them much or by shooting 7 very long days in a row.
Back with the Ex,I feel like this is Costner bluffing the studio. I bet they give him another raise and he somehow finds availability for the rest of season.
Back with the Ex,This is crazy and something that should’ve totally been ironed out before any commitments were made on either project. Same thing happened with Pedro Pascal and his work with the Last of Us. There was a potential issue with his work on the Mandalorian so he got the green light from the Disney people that it’d be ok and wouldn’t interfere
Back with the Ex,"Isn't he one of the producer, i think it's more about ending Yellowstone since Paramount doesn't have streaming rights(Peacock does) and using this filming schedule as the public facing excuse to can it"
Back with the Ex,"Cause fuck you my time is money, if I had his money you wouldn’t know VicMackeyLKN"
Back with the Ex,"I don’t know how many times I’ve heard my old man talk about Yellowstone’s inevitable ending because Costner was taking more time to spend with his family. It definitely may be part of his time-accounting, but that explanation falls flat after reading this."
Back with the Ex,"WesternWorld

*What if the whole world was Montana?"
Back with the Ex,Should've gotten Kurt Russell to play John Dutton
Back with the Ex,Wyatt Earp could have been great with some better writing and a tighter screenplay. Releasing in the same year as Tombstone didn’t do it any favours either.
Back with the Ex,[deleted]
Back with the Ex,"To be fair, I'd rather get another Costner directed western than more of him running around Yellowstone season 50"
Back with the Ex,They don’t give me free awards anymore so just know that this is my favorite comment of the day.
Back with the Ex,The circle of life.
Back with the Ex,"Whatever it is... It's better than the ""Libertarian Cowboy Sopranos for Boomers"" show he's on now"
Back with the Ex,"Ahhh, the more things change, the more they stay the same."
Back with the Ex,"From another person's comment:

> Horizon already shot Part 1 last year. The cast is crazy ... Costner, Sienna Miller, Luke Wilson, Sam Worthington, Thomas Haden Church, Jena Malone, Michael Rooker, Danny Huston, Will Patton, and more.

Back with the Ex,">He drinks piss 

""Can I pay $7.50 to see Kevin Costner drink his own urine?"" - Dana Carvey"
Back with the Ex,Whos gonna play Tom Petty?
Back with the Ex,Beth & Jamie  daddy issue will grow exponentially
Back with the Ex,Or he’s Governor. Just write him actually doing his job away from the ranch
Back with the Ex,"My theory: McConaughey is going to play John Dutton's father, in a series that takes place between 1923 and Yellowstone, before the flashbacks.  Maybe in the 70s or 80s (not sure one the math of when his father would have been in his 50s)."
Back with the Ex,Jimmy is in the new Alex Garland movie Civil War
Back with the Ex,Jimmy and that whole plot line is by far the worst part of the show for me
Back with the Ex,Jimmy's character and the forced ad campaign for Sheidan's own 6666 ranch is the equivalent of watching mud dry.
Back with the Ex,Yeah this basically seems like what they’re doing
Back with the Ex,Part of me is shocked that this hasn't happened. Paramount has to be kicking themselves that they ever sold the rights to it's streaming.
Back with the Ex,This is honestly the first thing that came to my mind lol.
Back with the Ex,"Petty, but *very* believable."
Back with the Ex,"They basically did this with South Park I think by restructuring the show to have only 6 episode seasons on CC/Hbo Max, and 2 ""movies"" that go straight to P+"
Back with the Ex,"Oh definitely, this is just a smokescreen so that Comcast doesn't sue them."
Back with the Ex,Is the deal with peacock temporary and just for as long as it’s airing? Or will Yellowstone be on peacock forever
Back with the Ex,[deleted]
Back with the Ex,"I’m sold on the idea, but only if his name stays Cousin"
Back with the Ex,Rips long lost brother... Rustin.
Back with the Ex,I'm sure the hundreds of other people who work on Yellowstone probably don't feel the same
Back with the Ex,"This is the shit.

The dude apparently isn't even obsessed with Westerns, he just ends up making them. Good for him, Dances with Wolves and that one other Western he directed are both better than all of the Yellowstone shows combined."
Back with the Ex,"Yeah, by season 5 she's become a caricature of herself. It's weird."
Back with the Ex,"If she doesn’t get utterly destroyed before the show ends I will be mad. Straight up worst character in the entire show. Idk why they try and have sweet moments with her and Rip. How am I supposed to feel happy for one of the worse human beings I’ve ever seen portrayed. 

I love how there was a part of last season where it made a point of her not treating the orphan like a pet but in season 5 Beth has nothing to do with the kid and literally treats him like a barn in a stall, to be taken out and ridden every now and then or gawked at while she’s out and about on the farm. 

She needs to be put in prison or die. I’ll die on that hill."
Back with the Ex,"The theme of the show is ""get the fuck off my land"", really.

Every season a big badder businessdude tries to take their land through some convoluted scheme and the Duttons then proceed to murder the shit out of them in various increasingly absurd ways.

>!The funniest of those is when Rip Wheeler (Cole Hauser) puts a rattlesnake in a cooler, and throws it in Roarke Morris's (Josh Holloway, AKA Sawyer from Lost) face.!<"
Back with the Ex,Haha
Back with the Ex,He probably wanted to make Horizon forever but didbt have the clout and commercial success to justify the budget till now.
Back with the Ex,"Maybe it's not so nefarious and the man simply wants to do what he wants to do? You know, making his art like artists are supposed to? I don't think he needs to be a major movie star again."
Back with the Ex,"> all the studio got in return was a series cancelation

And all the money. And awards. And spinoffs. Also Costner doing 5 seasons is probably more than they even expected, thats a long time for someone like him."
Back with the Ex,"They got five seasons out of him.  For an actor of Costner’s stature, that’s pretty damn good."
Back with the Ex,"And goddamn the only reason Costner got the Globe, was because he used to be a big movie star. It was one of them ""pity prices"" to get more people interested in the award show."
Back with the Ex,">This must have been a long time coming.

Knowing about how Costner acted in the 90's, when he was a major movie star, I'm surprised this didn't happen sooner."
Back with the Ex,He’s a garbage diva.
Back with the Ex,"It has its moments. It's also frequently absurd.

It's like Sons of Anarchy with a cowboy gang rather than a biker gang."
Back with the Ex,"It starts off okay and the first couple of seasons are fairly watchable but it's a soap opera at heart and the melodrama just increases to thoroughly stupid and unbelievable levels as it goes on. 

To add insult to injury, series writer Taylor Sheridan increasingly crops up as a character and spends way too much time showing off his performance horse riding skills.

I should note that I've not yet seen season 5, maybe it gets better?"
Titans,"With these cancellations and The Flash ending as well, the only DC live-action series that haven't officially been canceled are Superman and Lois, Pennyworth, and Peacemaker."
Titans,"Probably a good length for Titans to be honest.

Shame to see Doom Patrol go though."
Titans,Next headline will be them getting wiped off the service
Titans,"Doom Patrol had a solid run, but it probably is the right time to go.  The show was spectacular in the first season, and the drop off hasn't been big, the show feels like it has run its course and they'd be repeating themselves

It was great at times, but the premise was a hard sell to most people, even if they were superhero fans.  This many seasons was honestly a blessing.

This is really one of those times where you shouldn't cry because it's over but laugh like a maniac that the show even existed."
Titans,"Both shows have known for a while and they will have definitive endings. They both have 6 episodes left that will air later this year.

HBO Max:

>“While these will be the final seasons of ‘Titans’ and ‘Doom Patrol,’ we are very proud of these series and excited for fans to see their climactic endings. We are grateful to Berlanti Productions and Warner Bros. Television for making such thrilling, action-packed, heartfelt series. We thank ‘Titans’ showrunner Greg Walker, executive producers Greg Berlanti, Akiva Goldsman, Sarah Schechter, Geoff Johns, Richard Hatem, and the team at Weed Road Pictures. For ‘Doom Patrol,’ we celebrate showrunner Jeremy Carver and executive producers Greg Berlanti, Sarah Schechter, Geoff Johns, Chris Dingess and Tamara Becher-Wilkinson. For four seasons, fans have fallen in love with the ‘Titans’ and ‘Doom Patrol,’ investing in their trials and tribulations, and in their legendary battles saving the world time and time again.”"
Titans,"Titans could have been so good, I actually mostly enjoyed season 1 a lot. All severely downhill from there with season 3 being a very low point. And the actors are all good, sucks that the writing was so bad."
Titans,"*The current fourth seasons of both of the Greg Berlanti-produced HBO Max dramas will be their last, sources tell The Hollywood Reporter. Sources say producers on both Titans and Doom Patrol saw the writing on the wall amid all the changes with DC Entertainment and plotted their current seasons with proper endings so as to not leave fans in a lurch.*

At least the creatives saw the writing on the wall with WBD gutting HBO Max and we will get proper conclusions to the shows. 

Pennyworth will be the next to go."
Titans,"I know people clown on them, but I'll miss the cwverse plus stargirl,doompatrol, and titans. Now, DC television is pretty much dead in the water unless there's any upcoming projects I'm unaware of."
Titans,Best thing about Doom Patrol was Brendan Fraser yelling “What the fuck?” at every opportunity.
Titans,"Doom Patrol definitely had more in the tank, would’ve loved to see a fifth season with Mr. Nobody returning in it"
Titans,"Kinda surprised to see no one here or in general mentioning ‘The Dead Boy Detective Agency’. After they showed up in Doom Patrol, it was supposed to spin off into its own series."
Titans,"Doom Patrol is probably my favorite show on TV at the moment and as much as this news fucking sucks, at least they knew going into Season 4 that it would likely be the last season and were given a chance to wrap everything up."
Titans,"Did Titans ever get any better?

I dropped off after Season 1, because the old school Teen Titans fan in me just hated how edgy it was."
Titans,"It was obvious with how everything was getting the axe no matter how well they did. 

Now personally. Doom Patrol found its footing very quick. It need what it wanted to to be. Knew how it wanted to use it's characters. I think some people were off put by how this was not a show about them becoming seasoned superheroes. Also that they wouldn't become perfect people after a season. Change is slow. 

Titans though was the opposite. They clearly wanted to make a Nightwing show(or a real Gotham Knights) but clearly couldn't get the concept to production without the Titans baggage. 

Just too much ""We are trying to show how they become the Titans...."". This grand origin some of these superhero shows are obsessed with. 

But the core was they wanted to do a Batman show. Dick Grayson of course technically qualifies for that but again the Titans element was a distraction."
Titans,"Such a shame , doom patrol has been such a creative and fresh super hero take , one of the few things DC has gotten right in the past decade"
Titans,Doom Patrol stayed good throughout. Good for them <3
Titans,"Things looking pretty grim for DC. In 2 or 3 years there might not be a single DC show airing. Gotham Knights is almost certainly a one-and-done. Superman and Lois and Pennyworth are probably ending after their next seasons, though nothing has been officially announced yet for them."
Titans,"Unsurprising news but I'm going to miss Doom Patrol, here's hoping it goes out on a high"
Titans,Doom Patrol's first two seasons were great but it's been going downhill for a while. The current season is boring. I wish it was still fun to watch but it isn't so I won't miss it. Titans has always been terrible. The fact it lasted this long is baffling.
Titans,"Well that's a bummer. I never got into Titans, but Doom Patrol is easily one of the best shows HBO Max has."
Titans,"I don’t understand why anyone like Titans. It basically morphed into a terrible version of Arrow in far fewer episodes, starting with the soft reboot in season 2. I didn’t watch season 3. 

This sub always shits on the CW shows, but the first few seasons of Arrow were way way way better than Titans. The Deathstroke storyline was done MUCH better in Arrow too, specifically. 

Then there’s the climax fight at the end of Titans season 2, where most of the “main characters” watch from a car instead of participating in the most stupid plot decision ever."
Titans,"“Diane Guerrero, April Bowlby, Alan Tudyk and Matt Bomer are among the stars of Doom Patrol, which counts Jeremy Carver as showrunner and exec producer alongside Johns, Berlanti and Schechter, among others.”

How about Oscar nominated actor Brendan Fraser?"
Titans,Doom Patrol was so good. Such a shame to see it end
Titans,"Doom Patrol went from top tier to ""dear gods the same plot lines again."""
Titans,I told myself I’d cancel if doom patrol goes
Titans,"I'm surprised Doom Patrol lasted this long, not because it's not a great show...in my opinion it's one of the best things on Television now.  But because it's not mayo and white bread for the masses television.  

it's a show you have to pay attention to, and can't engage in the usual ""i know where this is going, so I'll flip reddit on my phone while watching"" behavior. 

It's not for everyone, that's for sure."
Titans,Good riddance for Titans. Was basically a teen drama that occasionally had people doing superhero errands
Titans,Not gonna lie they lasted longer than I thought they would
Titans,"I really enjoyed season 1 of Doom Patrol, then 2 was okay. Three became obnoxious right away and bad enough by the 3rd or 4th episode that I had to completely dump the show.

Rare I've seen a show go from really intriguing to almost offensively stupid so quick."
Titans,Doom Patrol is done? Did Zaslav flex the wrong muscle?
Titans,"> Diane Guerrero, April Bowlby, Alan Tudyk and Matt Bomer are among the stars of Doom Patrol, which counts Jeremy Carver as showrunner and exec producer alongside Johns, Berlanti and Schechter, among others.


Are you kidding me... not mentioning Brendan Fraser in cast of Doom Patrol?!?! Especially now when he has finally his comeback in the movie industry?! Or Timothy Dalton... come on Hollywoodreporter -.-

I am ok about Titans ending... but Doom Patrol could definitely have used an another season maybe :/"
Titans,"Is this why both shows had a random midseason finale? Like maybe behind the scenes they knew it was coming so they took a break to make it end-able? There's really no reason a streaming show should take a break halfway through the season since they don't have the typical network broadcasting restrictions... and if they weren't done filming, they shouldn't have started airing.

I assume they'll be scrubbed off HBO Max within a few months after they end."
Titans,My wife and I love doom patrol.  Sad to see it go… but cyborg never really made much sense on the show for me.
Titans,"Doom Patrol and Stargirl were my favorite comic book shows, shame to see them go."
Titans,"Incredibly surprised they lasted this long, as a viewer of Titans."
Titans,So these shows are ending but they are pushing that god awful looking Gotham Knights show…? Gotcha
Titans,"I'm shocked these shows lasted that long, they would have been cancelled immediately any other network."
Titans,Nooooooooo!  I love both these shows :(
Titans,"Titans isn’t necessarily a bad show, but it never really hit its stride. Too many subplots that go nowhere, not enough focus on the characters building relationships with one another, the show added Superboy but had to sideline him for every problem for stakes to even exist. The first season was a great setup but after that the story was mostly a mess with some notable great highlights. 

Deathstroke was legitimately a great villain but man, the plot twist with Jericho was so jarring and felt so out of place in the street-level world they established. It ruins Deathstroke motivations which seemed pretty straightforward: he wanted revenge for the death of his son. 

Jason Todd’s red hood as the villain was a great idea, but was very poorly executed. Again, the show just needed to keep things straightforward, instead of all these unnecessary plot twists, they could have simply done Jason Todd, frustrated and feeling abandoned by the Titans, embraces his more violent ideals and takes a bloodier approach to dealing with criminals, which puts him in direct odds with the Titans. They could have done a story plot where Jason sets his sights on Scarecrow, desperate to prove himself, while Robin tried to keep him alive, desperate to prove that he can be the hero again. 

It always felt the story was on the right train but on the wrong track."
Titans,"Doom Patrol ending, yet Velma gets a 2nd season? This is truly the darkest timeline..."
Titans,"Iirc one of the showrunners for Doom Patrol mentioned on Twitter that there was always a 4 season arc planned out so it ending at 5 seasons is fine with me. Im sure it was never that popular, glad they at least got to tell a full story and it sounds like a proper ending"
Titans,"> Doom Patrol

FUCK ZASLAV

Doom Patrol, Minx, and Raised by Wolves but fucking greenlights MILF reality shows of women dating each's son? Fuck this guy"
Titans,Booooooooooooooooooooooo
Titans,BOOOOO
Titans,This is horrible news! Doom Patrol is some of the best television I’ve seen in decades!!!
Titans,really sad to see doom patrol go that’s the only DC show i liked & never missed an episode or gave up on. Titans & Legends of Tomorrow were the 2 i missed episodes & gave up on. 🤷🏼‍♀️
Titans,"One I am surprised lasted this long and the other I'm surprised it was made at all.  I'm really going to miss Doom Patrol when it's gone, but I'm glad it got so much AND brought Brendan back into my life."
Titans,"I'm glad to hear that they're saying the shows will be crafted to a proper ending. Doom Patrol is great, Titans is okay though I do watch. I just never like seeing shows get unceremonious cancellations."
Titans,Phew now I don't need to feel guilty about pirating them due to having protest cancelled HBO Max over all the other shit that's happened
Titans,Doom Patrol deserves better.  One wonders wtf these companies plan to offer us in exchange for our money?
Titans,Titans should have never started. Dumpster Fire.
Titans,So sad both were good shows but I particularly love Doom Patrol. So unique.
Titans,At least this show won't run for 150 seasons and we'll remember it as a good product.
Titans,"Titans season 3 was really bad, but all 3 seasons of doom patrol have been great. so why cancel that?"
Titans,"Shame about Doom Patrol as I've got really into it the last few weeks/months, binging the first 3 seasons all the way through. I can see how season 4 can be a well tied up end though. I hope the main actors go onto good things as they've been excellent."
Titans,"It figures, the instant i get hbo.  Thanks!  
  
/s"
Titans,"Once he's pulled his golden parachute irl, I expect DC to introduce a new super villain called ""The Seagull"" whose real name is an anagram of Zaslav (good luck with that)."
Titans,It’s good they’re getting to wrap up the stories at least.
Titans,Horseshit
Titans,"Im on Season 4 of Doom Patrol and although I loved the first 3 Seasons (for so many reasons!) I’m feeling that they’re struggling for relevancy and plot lines that are in any way meaningful in Season 4. Loved the surreal, crazy, anything-goes aspect but it’s time for a wrap. Can’t wait to see how it all concludes."
Titans,"They dug Titans grave when they decided they weren't going to release the 4th season on Netflix nor release the show in HBO latinoamerica. 

They deliberately cut their audience by more than half with that move, of course it was going to be canceled, specially since most of the show's audience most likely came from Netflix, of all the people I know who watched the show none of them even knew it was on HBO until they heard S4 was released and it wasn't on Netflix.

About Doom Patrol I can't say anything besides that it is a shame but I can see why they canceled it since the show didn't had the traction other DC shows had and if we add Warner's financial problems, well, I suppose it was inevitable."
Titans,"I now realized why I was so confused: these are two different tv shows. I think I always thought it was one, and having never watched it, I was always confused when people would describe it (them).

Is anyone willing to compare/contrast the two shows? Do you like one better than the other?"
Titans,Doom Patrol ending makes me sad. It's one of my favorite shows right now.
Titans,At first I was super bummed (this is the firat season of Titans that I actually liked) but after thinking about it again I decided to be thankful that both got that far. I was surprised Doom Patrol was even renewed for a second season.
Titans,Good to see them ending on their terms but both seasons have been bad this year and glad there coming to a close
Titans,Doom Patrol has been amazing from day one. I will miss them. Glad they will get a proper ending
Titans,nooooo I love doom patrol
Titans,Titans has become completely unwatchable.
Titans,"Damn, seems all the superhero shows I grew up with have/are ending. :("
Titans,"Those TV shows were arguably the only good part about DC live action and it certainly was the best. TV shows are the best form of media and somehow Hollywood can't keep from ruining it.

Hardly any better way to tell a story that way other than a video game. You would think with the level of cancellations no one is watching TV and that's just simply not true.

In fact I would wager people are watching more TV now than they ever have because of streaming services. So, besides some degenerate level money spending what can possibly be the excuse for all these cancellations?"
Titans,"Expected Titans to get axed tbh. It has been atrocious. The writing is so unbelievably bad after S1. They had S3 to fix things, had a couple good episodes and then the rest were just shit. Sad thing is the actors themselves are great minus Tim Drake's."
Titans,"Velma has a high chance of getting S2 but DP gets cancelled...

Y'all hate watched Velma into renewal"
Titans,I enjoy both shows - but I can see where they need to come to an end.  Hopefully they end strong.
Titans,This season of doom patrol is not good
Titans,"Let's be real, Doom patrol was interesting on a 5/10 scale, but that's it. Brendan carried the show. Was pretty boring otherwise"
Titans,Brenton Thwaites occasionally shirtless over the course of four seasons was worth it.
Titans,Titans was good until they changed the platform it was streaming on and stopped me from continuing with it. Hbo max isn’t in my country and I’m not gonna pay double to finally see it
Titans,[deleted]
Titans,Season 3 of Titans was more like a CW teen drama
Titans,Gotham Knights looks like hot garbage
Titans,"Titans is just another CW show with higher budget. Just dim lighting, that Blue tint, and never ending angst. Man I was looking forward to an adult, titans superhero show. Instead it's just constant angst and hurt and nonsense over and over. It was a teenagers idea of edgy; all darkness and they swear!"
Titans,So at this point what shows are HBO making besides Velma and dragon thrones?
Titans,"Ever since I heard that Titans was a recycled project from a scrapped TNT show, I always wondered if that would have been better.

I hatewatched the show for a while but did not enjoy it."
Titans,Fuck Zaslav.
Titans,More money available for the MILF Manor spin-offs.
Titans,"How did Titans last as long a Doom Patrol, honestly?"
Titans,Well after the last of us time to cancel HBO MAX.
Titans,"Didn’t care for Titans, but , yeah Doom Patrol is one of those shows that should only be about 4 or 5 seasons. Any more and it’d probably just become weirdness for the sake of weirdness"
Titans,[deleted]
Titans,"Well, that sucks. I now wish Disney would buy Discovery/Warner so DC would actually have a chance of having its properties given the attention they deserve."
Titans,"Sad, but it gives room for a proper titans/teen titans show."
Titans,"Yeah, Gunn and Safran cleaning house. The exact same thing happened with all the Marvel shows when Disney + was launching"
Titans,"Titans had so much potential, but then they wasted it."
Titans,I'm 4 episodes into the first season of Doom Patrol and can't help but think it just drags. Does it get better? I feel like it doesn't know what genre it wants to be.
Titans,"What the f¥€k!! Without Doom Patrol, how the f¥€k am I f¥€king going to get my daily minimum amount of f¥€Ks in? This f¥€king pisses me off!"
Titans,"Good riddance.

Let all these cw type shows end.

Peacemaker was awesome go from there."
Titans,Am I the only one off-put by Baby Jane's obvious plastic surgery? She was a natural beauty and now she looks like every other Desperate Housewife. I don't understand it.
Titans,"Yes, let’s just stop with this super hero crap and spend more effort with original programming."
Titans,While Gotham Knights will have 10 seasons...
Titans,"Titans and Doom Patrol had so much potential. The reason as to why they are both tanking is because they decided to move away from the DC cannon to make their own PCC correct world. We learned from star wars. It was unrewarding, boring, and thoughtless. Star Wars died in that horrible Kathleen Kennedy accident. Transformers died in that horrible Michael Bay accident. Now DC is going to die, in that horrible, and embarrassing Warner Brothers accident. Corporations are out of touch with real people nowadays. Until you have someone that’s connected to the audience to help create, you will always fail."
Sex Education,I thought season 4 was the last season.
Sex Education,"I really enjoyed Sex Education.

I'd prefer they stop on a high note in season 4 rather than force out more seasons. 

Coordinating the cast's (now busy) schedules is really hard, so more seasons will likely require doing a huge recast"
Sex Education,Spoiler alert: season 4 ends with Eric leaving in a blue police call box.
Sex Education,"Feels like S4 is shaping up to be its last. Obviously could technically still keep going i guess, but can't think of any show that lost so many key characters and still managed to still be at the same quality."
Sex Education,"Well damn, I guess her and Otis ain’t getting together after all."
Sex Education,If they are continuing it past season 4. They should just do a spin off. Otis can be a side character maybe but follow someone new. I think that would be better than continuing Otis’ storyline with Emma or Ncuti. Just give the audience a good ending for them and continue with someone else.
Sex Education,Otis isn’t gonna have any friends left
Sex Education,Ruby redeemed?
Sex Education,"otis back to ruby pls🙏🏻 i still see that “i love you” scene and get butterflies, idk why but its so genuine, maybe im a touchy dumbass tho"
Sex Education,"High school tv shows are not supposed to go past 4 seasons. You either pull a Smallville off and have the entire show completely change in order to expand and fit the adulthood of its characters, with full on jobs, big city life and more mature storylines like matrimony and so on, or you just stop when they graduate, like the horrible 13 Reasons Why."
Sex Education,".....well why the fuck would I watch it, then?

Unless this is a joke about there being no season 5 anyway."
Sex Education,"I love the show. However, I'll be shocked if it gets a season 5"
Sex Education,"After winning the BAFTA for Rising Star, she’s probably set up for some major projects, that award has an big hit rate for its winners."
Sex Education,I can't imagine we see a s5
Sex Education,"""And that's when I finally knew I was educated about sex."" 

THE END"
Sex Education,So you’re telling me she’s NOT Gillian Jacobs/Margot Robbie?
Sex Education,It’s time for that show to end anyway. No show about high school should last longer than four years
Sex Education,Well it seems I will stop watching after season 4
Sex Education,We’re leaving
Sex Education,"I mean, they could end the series, it's not good or funny anymore anyway."
Sex Education,Don't make this like Boy Meets World:The College Years.
Sex Education,Series 3 was terrible so it should have ended anyway
Sex Education,This show is basically porn. I have kids and think this show needs to end. Seriously every season they make of this show I end up having another kid with my wife because you put on some porn and one thing leads to another. For the sake of my bank account quit making this show!
Sex Education,"Outside of them doing a Skins and a full recast, no reason the show should go past season 4. They should be graduating soon and probably the entire cast wants to move on."
Sex Education,"She reminds me of Margit Robbie so much

It will be a good final season"
Sex Education,S1-S2 I loved. I couldn’t get past the first couple episodes of S3 — some of the worst TV I have ever watched.
Sex Education,Finally! The shipping of her and Otis is finally over. I swear it is as bad as Friends.
Sex Education,Yes this was made aware a few days ago at least
Sex Education,"kill it already, nobody cares anymore. its been ages and half of cast left."
Sex Education,I never finished season three since the actors were far too old for their roles.  Season 5 would have them in wheelchairs.
Sex Education,See you on the “Actors who left parts and didn’t go anywhere” list in a few years.
Sex Education,One of the worst shows ever made
Sex Education,No!
Sex Education,"Makes sense, her career is really blowing up right now."
Sex Education,"I thought everyone was leaving... I don't even watch the show and I knew it was supposed to be over. I read it on one of those ""tv shows being renewed/cancelled"" lists, lol"
Sex Education,Bring on a new cast and setting like in Skins.
Sex Education,I thought it was the finale also. Most of the main characters are moving on. And there isn’t much of a story left.
Sex Education,"I hope it doesn't become the new elite, which will go on forever until it becomes trash..."
Sex Education,prob should be since ncuti gatwa is leaving too.
Sex Education,"Even if it wasn't planned, the last season made me tired of the ""Oh no, will the two characters who the writers obviously want to get together get together, but there's now this NEW obstacle! And lack of communication!"" thing that has been going on for the last few season. Like, season 1, OK, that's fine. Season 2 it started feeling old. Season 3 and I felt like ""Get on with it."""
Sex Education,"Well in that case, she’s definitely leaving after season 4"
Sex Education,Season 2 should’ve been.
Sex Education,"Yeah for example Ncuti Gatwa has been filming the fourth season, and starting on Doctor Who at the same time. From set photos it seems that he's been going back and forth between the two. That's something I imagine is only short term while he finishes up on Sex Ed, as it must be a nightmare for both shows to align their schedules with each other, particularly as he's the main character of one."
Sex Education,"That’s the thing with Netflix they either stretch out a successful series to the point it barely makes sense anymore or they just cut it short without mercy. 

There’s very few exceptions to this rule as BCS or Dark."
Sex Education,I liked season one and watched a lot of season 2. At a certain point it just felt like EVERYTHING in the show has to revolve around sex. Like I get that's the premise of the show to an extent but it just gets exhausting. Sex is great and all and it's fun to talk about but it's not all encompassing as an adult.
Sex Education,That would be a good little easter egg if the last time we see him is entering a police call box to make a phone call or something
Sex Education,Friday Night Lights after season 3?
Sex Education,Mackey leaving and probably Ncuti was well considering he’s the new Doctor Who.. focusing on a good ending with season 4 seems the best idea.
Sex Education,Degrassi shows it can be done but it gets messy. So many characters had to repeat grades just so they could keep them around
Sex Education,JUSTICE for Ruby
Sex Education,They’re going to f**k for 9 episodes straight next season. The End.
Sex Education,What do you thing season 4 is about?? They’ll always be the main couple in the show. That’s the whole show.
Sex Education,[deleted]
Sex Education,Their chemistry was amazing and their scenes were better written then Maeve and Otis which lost it's heat after season 1.
Sex Education,We are all suckers for moments like those
Sex Education,"Buffy somehow pulled it off although it did go downhill a bit after graduation.  That said, my two favorite episodes (Hush, Once More With Feeling) were both post highschool."
Sex Education,"Yeah One Tree hill had this massively , the first few seasons were fun teen drama 

season 5 jumped like 5 years and they were all in jobs and it was god awful shit"
Sex Education,this made no sense until I realized you are thinking US. High School in UK is 2-3 years ending with A levels
Sex Education,"I agree. Love everything we've gotten so far, but really feel the story should end while it's still good."
Sex Education,"Yea I recently watch it through.  Love it, but definitely no need to add on seasons to make it stale. And I thought I had read that season 4 was the last season, but mayhe I imagined that."
Sex Education,You're correct. She's not two different people.
Sex Education,"For the entirety of the movie until the credits rolled at the end, I 100% thought that was Margot Robbie in Death on the Nile."
Sex Education,"""Fuck this ship!"""
Sex Education,Lolz
Sex Education,You seem to care though.
Sex Education,lol appreciate the different point of view i guess
Sex Education,Honestly could have just wrapped it after 3. Maeve in America is kinda a dumb plotline
Sex Education,"Maybe they're going for various ""generations""."
Sex Education,Money
Sex Education,I'd prefer they stop on a high note in season 4 rather than force out more seasons.
Sex Education,They’re also like 35 year olds playing 17 year olds.
Sex Education,">Most of the main characters are moving on.

Moving on to do what?"
Sex Education,Elite was trash after season 1.
Sex Education,It already has.
Sex Education,I've heard that all the protagonists from season 1 are gone
Sex Education,For Doctor Who?
Sex Education,i only saw season 1
Sex Education,">BCS

That is only if we all decide to pretend that Better Call Saul is a Netflix show"
Sex Education,I still can't believe Kim was part of Sic Mundus and she was actually a grown up Kaylee Ehrmantraut.
Sex Education,I really enjoyed the latest season of Stranger Things and think it came close to the magic of the first season.
Sex Education,What shows to they stretch on too long? They don’t have that money super long running shows
Sex Education,Stranger Things and Narcos are exceptions too imo.
Sex Education,Voltron and Dragon prince were like thatVoltron was about to get good and hit all the notes but got cut back and dragon prince I would say should have ended in season 3.
Sex Education,"BoJack comes to mind. Was at the forefront of the morose cynical comedies, got a lot of praise and viewership, and just lost the plot and ran the show into the ground… fizzling off with no fanfare."
Sex Education,And then he turns to the audience and gives a little wink while saying hi the doctor will see you now while David Tennant dances in the background. Fun Easter egg
Sex Education,Just got to luck into finding a Michael B Jordan
Sex Education,"The thing with *FNL* was it still had Kyle Chandler to serve as a constant through line for the changing students which made sense. All of the new cast was involved with him to some degree. They also still had a good portion of the original cast - Taylor Kitsch, Jesse Plemons, Zach Gilford, etc.

With *Sex Education*, you really only have Groff serving in a similar capacity, and I don't think he really works the same way as he barely has a good relationship with any of the students (including his son). And the other teachers are sort of side characters. 

Gillian Anderson could make the most sense to step into this kind of role (and I suppose they still could), except her involvement in the school and students has been fairly sporadic.

Not that they can't try to bring in a new slate of students (and they've already added and subtracted some from the cast), but I don't think they could do it as seemlessly with so many of the students either gone in Season 3 or presumably leaving after the upcoming season."
Sex Education,"And with Mackey and Ncuti leaving, it certainly gives Wood (Aimee) and Swindells (Adam) a lot less to do since their storylines are usually fairly tightly tied to theirs. Perhaps I'll be proven wrong, but Aimee without Maeve and Adam without Eric don't seem much worth following in a Season 5."
Sex Education,Ncuti is confirmed to be leaving too.
Sex Education,Ruined the best damn relationship in the entire show
Sex Education,fuck
Sex Education,I'd watch it: True Sex Education ;p
Sex Education,fuck
Sex Education,"dude i remember watching that particular episode where they had a fucking blast together as pick me up tv like the office and shit. that relationship just worked and it felt nice, now emma and otis were great at first as well but the second him and ruby got together it was just nicer"
Sex Education,"Buffy did a great job of that, but the show's premise never had to be tied down to school life.

Sex Education kinda doesn't work if they're adults."
Sex Education,"I'm thinking swiss italian actually lol, but yeah same"
Sex Education,Did you mean “England”?
Sex Education,A levels are basically still high school though.
Sex Education,She’s four: Gillian Jacobs/Margot Robbie/Jaime Pressly/Elisabeth Shue
Sex Education,"Well, I like all three, but I do find it amusing how they have very similar features."
Boogiepop and Others,"I'll go to this especially if they can get the leads like Duchovny, Anderson, Robert Patrick and Mitch Pileggi. I have a copy of the X-Files (original) series finale and have always wanted to get it signed by the cast."
Boogiepop and Others,"He can make a fortune by charging fans for a chance to throw tomatoes at him.

No one liked his ""new"" season 11. Even the stars hate it and aren't coming back."
Boogiepop and Others,Maybe he'll blame Gillian Anderson again or everyone but himself for there being no Season 12?
Boogiepop and Others,"I still remember when the series premiered.

My dad sat on a chair in the TV room while my sister and I sat on his lap.  I don't remember what day of the week the show started but it would eventually be moved to Sundays.  It basically became a weekly ritual for the three of us right up until my sister left for college then me.  Even then we'd all watch it together then talk about the episodes over the phone afterwards.  They came over to my house to watch the reboot or whatever you want to call it from a few years ago.  

It's just a great memory I have and undoubtedly contributes to why it's one of my all time favorite shows."
Boogiepop and Others,Does this mean there will be a millennium celebration too?
Boogiepop and Others,"Despite all the plot holes, I absolutely adore the entire series and even the movies."
Boogiepop and Others,"'The X Files' remains one of my favorite TV shows of all time. Would love to see a TV movie starring the original cast, just make sure that someone other than Carter is writing it."
Boogiepop and Others,"Maybe it's due to my age, but X-files was one of those shows that visually looked absolutely ancient at the beginning of it's run, and modern towards the middle. Same with Law and Order."
Boogiepop and Others,"Someone needs to ask Chris Carter to explain how the mythology of the revival seasons is any way consistent with like... seasons 5-9 of the show.   
Waiting so long for a follow up on the show's ending... only to have a second movie come out and kinda handwave it away and then to have a revival come up that basically says: ""Lol.  Forget about that."" was extremely frustrating.  The Smoking Man's master plot was in no way consistent to anything that came before."
Boogiepop and Others,"bloody hell, that's a real life Thunderbirds character"
Boogiepop and Others,Chris Carter is the worst thing to happen to the X-Files.
Boogiepop and Others,Beginning to think we're in such a mess with disinformation and people believing in the weirdest shit possible because of this show.
Boogiepop and Others,"Oh, Chris Carter is in this?"
Boogiepop and Others,"Jesus christ, that was an incredibly long journey to discover that tickets aren't even on sale yet. MoA doesn't even mention it as an event."
Boogiepop and Others,"I loved The X-Files (MOTW more than the mythology eps) But it should have ended when David Duchovny left. I understand the network's reluctance to let it go, and the money must have been attractive. But Duchovny was the star, main antagonist, and the whole reason that ""the X-Files"" existed in the first place. After he left, it was a different show, and not for the better."
Boogiepop and Others,"At some point near the end of the show's original run he clearly decided that wrapping up literally any storyline would make people lose interest, so, now he just blows up the whole mythology every 10 episodes by revealing everything was a lie, and, ironically, people lost interest. Like, imagine the revival had been a proper final season, with answers and invasions and like, CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT. But nah."
Boogiepop and Others,"Minus the Mythology episodes in Season 10, & 11, the monster of the week episodes were excellent."
Boogiepop and Others,Season 11 was actually surprisingly good - even great at times - outside of the godawful Carter bookend episodes (*especially* the finale). The cases-of-the-week were a lot of fun.
Boogiepop and Others,"Huge fan of this show.  After the 2nd movie, I didnt really have any high hopes Season 10 would be any good, but I watched it anyways. Then read about how Season11 started out and bailed, he did it again.  Carter lures us in with the promise that finally they get real evidence on UFOs, only to find out it isnt, or the evidence is stolen, or some other dip shit thing."
Boogiepop and Others,"The best thing in season 11 is that it finally concluded the main arc, I hated him when he always left the main arc open ended before season 11."
Boogiepop and Others,"That's a beautiful memory; thank you for sharing. You reminded me of my childhood as well: my siblings and I would wake up each Saturday morning and almost immediately run to the living room. We would sit on the mattress in front of the TV, and my brother would turn on the Nintendo 64. We then proceeded to play Mario Kart and other N64 games together while our parents made us breakfast."
Boogiepop and Others,"It looks a lot more modern now. It's been remastered from the original negatives and one of Carter's weird quirks was wanting the show shot so it looked good in 4:3 (TV aspect ratio in the 90s and before) and 16:9 (modern TV aspect ratio, I believe it was being used for some international TV at the time,) so the dated aspects now are mostly just the clothes and occasional bad special effect. Also worth noting that the show moved from Canada to LA after season 5 and they definitely started using a lot more backlots and less handheld camera work, making the later seasons a bit sleeker."
Boogiepop and Others,"Eh, sometimes a creator makes a setting that characters live in, and for them solving the setting isn’t interesting. They don’t care about the mystery, they shaped it, they care about the stories it enables. X-Files was before Lost. Carter is an old school storyteller. Settings are settings. AKA If the Ring reaches Mordor there is no longer a road trip story to be told, so they have no interest in ever getting to Mordor, concerned with only the journey there."
Boogiepop and Others,"He wanted to end with the movie (or movies) after season five but Fox (the network, not Mulder) wouldn't let him because the show was too profitable. Not entirely his fault it ended up sucking."
Boogiepop and Others,'Mulder and Scully Meet the Were-monster' and 'The Lost Art of Forehead Sweat' are some of my all time favs.
Boogiepop and Others,"The finale pissed me off immensely. Mulder, our now grown son that we gave away is dead! Scully, this sucks! Don't worry Mulder, I'm pregnant with a replacement child."
Boogiepop and Others,"Huge X Files fan. The plot has gotten so convoluted I couldn’t actually tell you what happened and what was real or not. 

Still love that shit tho…."
Boogiepop and Others,"Thanks for sharing your memories too. 

Mario Kart for Super Nintendo is another great memory.

We'd hear my dad's car pull into the driveway when we were kids and go running to the TV room to get the game setup.  We'd play with him until dinner was ready and, if our homework was done, straight up until bedtime.  To this day it's one of my favorite video games for that reason.

Another is SimCity for Super Nintendo.  My siblings and I were a little young for the game when it first came out but my dad could play for hours.  Eventually though we'd get a bit antsy and start asking to use one of the disasters then destroy the city lol.  The tables were turned when we were a bit older and started getting into building cities of our.  Then my dad would swoop in and unleash havoc.  

What great memories lol.  It's funny how things as small as watching TV or playing a game with our parents would come to mean everything."
Boogiepop and Others,"It’s sort of the core difference between TV shows and movies actually 

Movies need an ending. TV shows? They need to end the episode or season without resolving too much or the show is over. 

All that being said, I can understand why people were upset with the last season. It would’ve been amazing to finally get progression in the big plot lines. And it’s not like our choices were ending it or keeping the show going. Our choices were ending it with answers or ending without."
Boogiepop and Others,He's had another movie after than and two revival series to wrap it up since. At this point it's entirely his fault.
Boogiepop and Others,"Looking at that picture I just worry about the future of Yakko, Wakko, and Dot."
Boogiepop and Others,"“We’ve saved sooooooooo much money from firing all these people, cancelling all this content, what are we going to do with this leftover pile of cash? Well I guess the employees and the creators don’t want it, someone has to take it”"
Boogiepop and Others,"For those who don’t know, Zaslav was among the highest paid CEOs in the world last year, making $250m. Cutting that down to a normal salary could probably pay for everything he canceled."
Boogiepop and Others,"Motherfucker fires scores of employees/execs, cancels shows and films or sells them to cheap ad-ridden streaming services...

And rewards himself a bonus with what little cash they've made after ""reducing the debt""."
Boogiepop and Others,"> Warner Bros. Discovery is shifting its corporate focus to generating free cash flow and reducing its debt load, and it wants its top executives on the same page.


> The company on Monday said it will be tweaking its compensation packages for top executives, offering bonuses in the form of performance stock units based on their success in generating cash and helping the company reduce its leverage. 


> That includes WBD CEO David Zaslav, who will see his 2023 performance restricted stock units (PRSUs) tied to free cash flow. Those PRSUs have a target value of $12 million, however, if the company overdelivers on its cash flow effort, it could be doubled. He will also be eligible for a separate $11.5 million block of PRSUs, which will also be tied to cash flow performance, and which could also be doubled if the company overdelivers.


> Zaslav’s total compensation was $246 million in 2021, tied to the merger of WarnerMedia and Discovery. Of course, much of that compensation will depend on performance (specifically on share price, a metric that few media or entertainment companies have been able to deliver on recently). His 2022 compensation will be disclosed in the coming weeks."
Boogiepop and Others,"And now it is clear why those fuckers gutted HBO Max, killed all those shows and movies, fired people left and right... It wasn't some shitty sad but necessary moves to save the company from a bad situation but to give themselves personally more money."
Boogiepop and Others,"I would love to see an experiment conducted one day. Split the company in half, one half gets to exist with the current bunch of overpaid idiots and the other half gets a brand new C suite, people straight out of college and not with degrees from fancy colleges either. 

Let’s see how the recent grads do. If they do well sign them to a contract for the next 5 years at a million dollars a year."
Boogiepop and Others,And the people doing all the hard work get nothing in an economy that is continuing to get worse
Boogiepop and Others,Fattening the calf for sale. Nothing to see here apart from that.
Boogiepop and Others,"I like news about WBD and Zaslav, it attract all the morons and financial illiterates."
Boogiepop and Others,That was always the plan.
Boogiepop and Others,"This is actually really gross. They could get even *more* money, but all the people that got laid off get nothing. They could've laid off less people, but it's just more cash in their pockets, which is just sad."
Boogiepop and Others,"ITT: MFs who don't know what free cash flow is.

I don’t agree with his way of doing things, I don’t agree that he deserves to be paid 250m (literally a DC movie per year just for him is insanity) but those are the KPIs that the board chose and when you’re the ceo of a public company, you’re the bitch of people owning tons of stocks. Those are your customers not us.

Free cash flow means that a company is making money as opposed to whatever you know about other tech companies when they were growing. It costs more to borrow money today and you can’t keep burning cash like netflix.

My point is that if you are going to hate on someone you should know more about them to be a better hater."
Boogiepop and Others,"A WGA writer I follow on Twitter basically said ""Hey, good to know they have the money to meet our demands!""

The existing WGA contract expires May 1.

And the SAG-AFTRA and DGA June 30…


And what's interesting this time around is the DGA almost always goes first and the rest piggy-back off their stuff. But the DGA is letting the WGA go first.


Because of the shit Zaslav (and others) pulled, like pulling shows entirely to forcibly stop royalty payments, it affects all of them. There is a non-zero chance of a live-action TV trifecta strike that would hit even reality TV.

(Animation is IATSE…but part of me wonders if they would if they won't strike in solidarity)"
Boogiepop and Others,This guy literally stole the royalties of all the shows and films he canceled/removed from the market just to pay himself. Not the kind of person anyone would want to do business with.
Boogiepop and Others,"Business as usual, God forbid an executive to not get more cash."
Boogiepop and Others,"Anyone know if James Gunn or Peter Safran are among those given a bonus, or if they’ve said anything responding to this? Just curious"
Boogiepop and Others,"Free cash flow huh?

I need me some of that."
Boogiepop and Others,Do these executives threaten to quit or something? How do they pull this off?
Boogiepop and Others,All that Batgirl money
Boogiepop and Others,Capitalism has its downsides. Man is flawed and we f’d it up.
Boogiepop and Others,This will be just another bullet point in the list of incidents that caused HBO to crash and burn under their leadership.
Boogiepop and Others,*Doing business...Dobis!*
Boogiepop and Others,Nah. That's bait
Boogiepop and Others,Surprise! That’s corporate America. Nothing to see here. No inflation in the united corporations of America.
Boogiepop and Others,They already got canceled
Boogiepop and Others,"In the new season the dumb security guard became the head of the studio, seemed like an epic zaslav burn"
Boogiepop and Others,"We don't even look at streaming on our TVs anymore. We look at it on our phones?? Paramount plus, apple tv plus, disney plus. I can remember these names better than my grandmothers!"
Boogiepop and Others,"""Our company is hemorrhaging money, we cant even afford to release movies this year, what can we do?""   


""Slightly reduce executive pay?""   


""You're fired"""
Boogiepop and Others,The fuck dose he do to deserve that kind of pay
Boogiepop and Others,"I'm sorry but you have absolutely no idea what you're talking about.

Warner Bros didn't pay him $250m in cash. He got $3m in his regular salary, $22m in cash bonuses, $5m in a one-off bonus, that's what the company actually paid him in cash, around $30m. Then you have $13m in stock bonuses which is the value of newly issued stock, not cash money transferred to Zaslav's account. That lands us at a total package of roughly $43m which is what he usually gets every year.

The $250m number is a one off thing based on the $205m valuation of future stock options he received through the Discovery merger. The company is required to assign a valuation on that form of compensation, but the number is very rough at best.

The most important part of those $205m options is that they are literally worthless as long as Discovery stock trades at under $35.6 per share. It was trading at around $23 per share when he received that bonus so to see even a dime of that $205m the company would have to increase in value by over 50% under his leadership (roughly a $30b increase)

I’m going off on numbers from memory so they might be off by a couple million here and there but you get the idea"
Boogiepop and Others,That would pay for about 1 Antman quantum mania
Boogiepop and Others,They paid off like 7B last year
Boogiepop and Others,"""Pay me $250 million, and I can save you $100 million by cancelling Batgirl!"" — Zaslav, probably"
Boogiepop and Others,"Warner Brothers Discovery lost 7 billion dollars per their last annual financial statement...and had to pay 7 billion+ to settle debt. 

I don't think you know how severe the situation is for the company and why a CEO would need to be well paid to take over a mess of this magnitude. 

It's easy to be the CEO of a company like McDonalds but it's way harder to be the CEO of a company that is very much staring down the barrel of eventual demise."
Boogiepop and Others,"That's not how that works. It's not cash and he doens't reward himself. Even though he's the big boss that doesn't mean he picks his own pay. He agrees to be CEO and accepts a certain compensation package (e.g. salary, and bonus structure). The company's board of directors determine what kind of package is offered. Commonly bonuses are based on performance of the stock. But in this case. the article is saying the board of directors want to see FCF and reduction of debt as their key metrics to whether or not he gets a bonus. In regards to it not being cash. These deals have moentary values but it's speculative. He gets shares/stocks of the company estimated to be worth that much if he reaches his goals and the stock price is the same. These shares/stocks are either shares in their treaasury or shares that they create from thin air."
Boogiepop and Others,"Welcome to capitalism, where the goal is more money for the rich through exploitation."
Boogiepop and Others,"What you're saying is true but it's also equally true to say ""man gets compensated for doing the things he was hired to"" even if those things are in the best interest of shareholders instead of creatives and consumers"
Boogiepop and Others,"You misread what the article said. They aren't giving away cash bonuses, they are giving away stock bonuses based on the company's FCF. The execs who lower the most debt, get the most stock bonuses."
Boogiepop and Others,"They didn't give themseles personally more money. Zaslav and other executvies agree to work for certain compensation package (e.g. salary and bonus structure). The ones making the changes are the board of directors who want to fix the massive debt problem and make sure the company has more money coming than out. It's common for bonus to be based on stock price but stock price can go up regardless of FCF, profit or debt. So to make sure they aren't jusst trying to raise the stock price or the stock price goes up on its own without fixing their other two problems they are changing the bonus condition to be based on them improve two metrics of FCF and debt instead of share price.

Killing those shows/movies and firign people is what reduces how much money goes out and it also reduces their losses helping curb debt. So the board of directors making debt and FCF as key metrics for whether or not Zaslav gets bonus compensation does not go againsst all the stuff Zaslav been doing."
Boogiepop and Others,"reddit is so financially illiterate, it's sad. Every WBD thread is just embarrassing."
Boogiepop and Others,"To be fair there is little the people you are talking about can do to positively impact the cash flow or debt situation of the company. So, no, they don't get anything except for a potentially a company that's still solvent years down the road because people high up had to make cuts to make the company operationally sound. 

Or the company can stay on it's current trajectory and those will for sure get unemployment checks down the road."
Boogiepop and Others,You didn't read the article. It helps to know what you're discussing before you tell people how right you are.
Boogiepop and Others,That’s not how that works
Boogiepop and Others,"Well, they are newcomers and Shazam 2 isn't even out yet, so I don't think that the board considered them part of the bonus."
Boogiepop and Others,"This is what we do, this is who we are!"
Boogiepop and Others,"That’s obvious, there’s always hope for a reboot of a reboot or a continuation someday."
Boogiepop and Others,"I saw that coming. The new show didn't have nearly the same variety feel as the original. I get that they couldn't get the rights to all the side characters, but they could have written new ones. Anyway, cartoon reboots are always weird because children aren't interested in nostalgia."
Boogiepop and Others,I will declare war on Warner tor this!
Boogiepop and Others,Dang. I liked the reboot.
Boogiepop and Others,NOOOOO!!!!!!!
Boogiepop and Others,Homegrown HBO stuff.
Boogiepop and Others,Netfish
Boogiepop and Others,"""That firing saved the company 130k plus bennies, bonus for the CEO!"""
Boogiepop and Others,For saving the world the pain of watching Batgirl /s
Boogiepop and Others,"I’m not trying to defend him, but when he came on, WB was billions in debt. They probably still are, but also probably less than they were before. His bonus is likely a fraction of what was saved.

The long term consequences of his leadership for WB has yet to be seen, but in the short term, he must have done what they wanted him to do. Cut costs."
Boogiepop and Others,You son of a bitch I'm in! :D
Boogiepop and Others,"So that necessitates paying the CEO 4% of what you already owe in debt? What Zaslav is doing is a mob bust-out, and it’s also a commonly tactic by private equity. He’s stripping the company bare and making himself rich in the process."
Boogiepop and Others,ceo worship is ridiculous.  They don't run the company by themselves and are way over paid compared to even 50 years ago.
Boogiepop and Others,Its so hard being a ceo of a failing company that elon can hold meetings on why his twitter posts arent getting enough engagement.
Boogiepop and Others,"In a decade this company will be circling the drain but zaslav will be much much richer. Great deal for him, bad for employees, long term share holders, and content consumers."
Boogiepop and Others,WBD does this and then complains about not having money and having to axe movies and shows for the write-off.
Boogiepop and Others,it is completelu rigged.  You get your buddies on the board and once you are in you get paid no matter how good or bad a job your do.  And if you do something so bad you get fired you are almost guaranteed a golden parachute.  CEO and c-suite pay is out of control.
Boogiepop and Others,But he gets that stock bonus for sacking folk and downsizing though yeah?
Boogiepop and Others,Trying to explain nuance to people of Reddit who didn’t make it past the headline? Good luck
Boogiepop and Others,"They use to give a fuck about making it less obvious.

Now here's these assholes gloating about it. ""You get a bonus for firing [such and such] many employees and killing [this many] films/shows with too many minorities in them!"""
Boogiepop and Others,"Welcome to reddit, where people who don't understand the first thing about business or the economy do nothing but complain about capitalism.  All while consuming far more media than the average person."
Boogiepop and Others,It’s the American way
Boogiepop and Others,Or in other words asshole gets hired to be an asshole and gets a bonus for being such massive asshole.
Boogiepop and Others,So this bonus is tied to how many shows and movies became tax write-offs ?
Hardy Bucks,Cool I am keen to check it out. Thanks for letting us know about it.
Hardy Bucks,"I only found it a few years ago and found one of my old training partners in BJJ was a character on the show. 

Lads, It's quite spot on in depicting a rural town in Ireland. The nicknames in it are a bit mad, but I mean like, the first two names I can think of from my local back home are Fast Eddie (with a son often referred to as Slow Eddie)  and Shaggy, it's not like French Toast is that far off. "
Hardy Bucks,Let me know what you think.
Hardy Bucks,I like it but my wife hates it. Acquired taste I think;)
When Heroes Fly,"Great news!

"
When Heroes Fly,Any idea when we will see this on Netflix in the US or Canada?
When Heroes Fly,This subreddit is full of anti-Israel useful idiots unfortunately. 
When Heroes Fly,[deleted]
When Heroes Fly,"thanks, excited to start watching in a few days.   Need to finish Deutschland 86"
When Heroes Fly,Pretty generic with some terrible acting and writing
When Heroes Fly,"This has cringe written all over it. Wrong actors, no chemistry, dumb names, terrible tactics and the list goes on and on."
When Heroes Fly,I don't know if using callsigns in daily life is a thing but it's cringe either way. And living in multi million dollar mansions while its apparently unsafe to go out for a run?
When Heroes Fly,"Why does it feel like a student film...   


Plus I think I could run military operations better than they do"
When Heroes Fly,"WHY IS THIS SHOW SO BAD
it was clearly very expensive to make
the actors are all individually talented 
but its the most unnatural, atonal and awkward thing I’ve ever seen
Nobody has any believability"
When Heroes Fly,Not interesting enough.
When Heroes Fly,Strike Back did it much better on a much lower budget.
When Heroes Fly,They don't behave like military personnel.
When Heroes Fly,Where did they get multi-million dollar homes? I must have spent my 27 years in the wrong military.
When Heroes Fly,41 minutes in and it's painfully generic. Say what you will about Amazon dad action shows but they manage to keep you watching. American action thriller tv shows are getting so boring lately though. The new season for Jack Ryan has him racing to stop rogue Russians wanting to set off a nuke. I can already see myself sleeping halfway through the first episode.
When Heroes Fly,"This show is hot garbage. Someone in spec ops would probably die laughing at all the tactics they got wrong in this. We arent even talking about how bad the acting is or the piss poor dialogue i fast forwarded through. 

Holy shit shows keep getting worse…"
When Heroes Fly,I’m only at the beginning of episode 2. So far the acting is pretty bad and most of the dialogue between the cast seems forced and awkward. Hopefully it gets better! 🤞
When Heroes Fly,So I tried watching. Can’t stand the female scientist nor her special ops winy ass husband. Annoying characters and not a big fan of the direction. It’s too artsy for an action thriller. I stopped watching after two episodes. Can’t do it.
When Heroes Fly,The Israeli version is far better.
When Heroes Fly,Could have been a. decent movie but the characters and story are not good enough to keep you interested. They drug it out too long for the story/plot. There isn’t really any surprises or suspense. It’s almost like someone wrote a script for a 1.5hr movie and the studio made them stretch the story out to six 1hr episodes.
When Heroes Fly,"Overall the show has a very awkward tone. Like there is no consistent vision on what the show ""is"". Parts action, parts drama, all bland - but none of it gels together. Like the woman is kidnaps and has bizarre chill scenes with her captors. There is no real sense of ""actual"" emergency to things. It just sort of stumbles along with low best music."
When Heroes Fly,"The ending is a total mess. You get rescued by your loved one who is risking his future to save you and yet you think you have a bigger problem and you want to coward it off?   


The journalists is stupid and why the stupid president wont do something to stop a tiny journalist challenging the sentiment. Seriously?!   


Blood spilled? Seriously? Who killed non militant during the assault? And again, this is war. Not dating session. 

This thing took so many episode to setup and yet the ending is like a piece of shit!"
When Heroes Fly,"r/echo3

Having watched all 3 episodes (ep 2 is the best IMHO)  I am suspecting that this show is a very subtle snub at US foreign policy and the ultimate futility of US military intervention...

If true, then this is superbly well done..."
When Heroes Fly,Anyone know what song that plays after episode 2? During the end credits
When Heroes Fly,Wow…bad. Really bad.  The director took a great idea for a show and ruined it with a bunch of weird shit.
When Heroes Fly,So this special forces dude and his research scientist wife have like a 5 million dollar house and a safe with hundreds of thousands of dollars. How? Did the soldier inherit money? Does special forces pay more than I assume. It is unrealistic and takes me out of the show. Why would some paramilitary group kidnap a research scientist? So far it makes no sense.
When Heroes Fly,"i just started watching it and i don't really know what i am watching. it looks very glossy. am having a hard time buying both leads as bad ass special ops dudes. i love luke evans but i feel like he is out of place here but i am only towards the end of the 1st episode so maybe things get better? 

the ladies husband seems like he is better suited for the senator stuff his dad talks about while his dad is dancing with his wife. like some senator with a little military background. 

i can't stop comparing it or putting up against another latest special ops type show we got which was pratt's terminal list. that show seemed more realistic to me then this however i know on that show you really had to suspend your beliefs and just accept that pratt's character was basically god. 

but yea i just feel like the 3 leads are mismatched.. the actors they chose for the roles don't make sense to me."
When Heroes Fly,"After just finishing the last season of Seal Team, with all of its attention to detail on tactical ops, this show in comparison just looks and sounds so amatuer.  These guys are supposed to be Delta?  Give me a break.  Just thier comms discipline alone sounds like a bunch of 10 year olds playing in the backyard!

And Jessica Ann Collins has this sort of Jennifer Lawerence vibe going on, which is distracting because she is NOT!  Not the look, not the talent, and as much as she tries to be sexy, its just more cringe than anything!

So far, nothing about this show seems to gel. Only 2 episodes in, and I'm a completionist so gotta finish the season...hope it gets better!"
When Heroes Fly,"Just finished ep3. If anyone is reading this who hasn’t started the show yet, don’t bother. The 2 main characters are morons and the writing is awful.  They get a taxi straight to the kidnappers house and hardly see a soul. Shoot a few guys and walk out? Are we also supposed to believe these two college girls are running this drug/guerilla gang?"
When Heroes Fly,"As soon as the guy who just got married ambushed his brother in law at a dinner and accused him of blowing the mission, I could almost predict the rest of the show.  His entire speech about military accountability made my sphentic pucker up.  Wasn't it the fault of the guy who just got married that the op went sideways?!  The guy who died on the mountain was left there because the guy throwing accusations was wounded and everyone had to completely go off script to rescue him.  So how does this character have any credibility after the total snow job he just pulled on everyone.

First of all... special forces teams are so bonded to each other this would never happen except apparently in this woke wet dream of a pseudo military story.  They just don't think like that whatever th3 reason.  The loyalty between members of a squad like this runs so deep rhat there's almost an irrational kind of faith in their other squad members.  
They wouldn't risk the dynamic changing which would expose them to incredible vulnerability when in combat.  
This puff piece of a film is out of its depth
.  This is why the entire industry is collapsing.  They have lost their self awareness about stuff they cannot understand... this is abysmal..."
When Heroes Fly,"Surprised at this from Apple TV. The first episode hasn't got me hooked and it was a struggle with unlikable characters.

Enjoyed Luke Evans' earlier work on 'The Hobbit' and 'The Alienist' but he's really not got much to work with here. 

Prince's reason for falling out with Bambi is just a wtf? stupid. Jessica Collins has been watching too many TED talks when styling her phytochemist Amber. The wealth and opulence aspect to it all is just weird - doesn't gel and tests limits of suspending disbelief.
 
I see the 'Terminal List' being mentioned in the thread a lot.  IMO, that is a work of art in comparison - I was able to switch off my brain and enjoy and binge that whole season in a long weekend - and hope for a second season...

I'll try a few more but..."
When Heroes Fly,"I have chosen to see the odd / convoluted story arcs as subtle / crafty commentary / reflection on the foibles of US military intervention post WWII...

So, I wonder how non-Americans perceive Echo3.

Everytime there is a cringe scene, it is intentional - symbolizing a cringe aspect of US foreign policy...

Seriously, taking this perspective has helped me watch this show...taking it from WTF to ""not great not, terrible..."" :-)

Echo3 is still not as bad (IMHO) as the Apple TV series Invasion...

(I am told one reason Jerry Lewis movies were popular in France is because his characters were clownish Americans.)"
When Heroes Fly,"Oldest actors, actress ever. Terrible dialogue, terrible casting at least for the Americans. Oh, we'd like to talk to the Chief of Station... sure thing, come on in and we'll read you in lmao. Just walk into the SCIF with me.

One of the SF actors is a Kiwi, and his American accent is terrible.  Bambi, what a gay fucking nickname.  

The only saving grace are some of the Latin actors who make it palatable. Whoever is responsible for casting should be kidnapped, taken to the jungle and shot."
When Heroes Fly,"The Radiohead 'love scene' followed by the chick saying she just wants a shot with Eric; it all sounds desperate as hell. Also, what's with the random ISIS flag at the Venezuelan prison?

Seriously, whoever wrote and directed this show should never be allowed to make a other series."
When Heroes Fly,"TERRIBLE tactics. The ambush scene alone… my god. The ambush element failed to have suppressive fire. They didn’t have access to a light machine gun?! They set off an IED and without knowing which vehicle the VIP was in. They engaged unarmed people fleeing. The ground team just sat the the bushes, then shot people in the legs instead of using something non-lethal like flash bangs. They allowed the clearly fully armed trucks to get to the kill zone, and didn’t engage. The list goes on. Beyond frustrating tactics, fucking elementary."
When Heroes Fly,"How does the reporter get so close to the Colombian President? How do they shoot the Venezuelan ministrr through a gate with no issue? Lastly, why are they merc'ing the very same Colombian troops that were helping them in the beginning. This is bloody awful."
When Heroes Fly,"A ton of style, not very good substance. I do appreciate the human aspects of it, but the characters are not very likeable. Just entitled Americans doing whatever the fuck they want and then they get somewhat of a happy ending with little repercussions. Like, they could've worn ANYTHING other than Columbian uniforms but they had to force that ""starting a war in a foreign country"" angle. Amber deciding to walk out when they're so close to leaving with targets on their backs."
When Heroes Fly,This show is so unrealistic and generic. The casting and script is shit.  Two spec-ops guys from the US just have free reign to galavant all about the Colombian countryside and meet with high level Colombian military COLONELS on a whim… AFTER THEY WENT ON NATIONAL COLUMBIAN TV DISRESPECTING TF OUT IF SAME SAID COLONEL?? Baaahahahahahahahhahahahaha this show is SHIT!! 🤡🤦🏻‍♂️
When Heroes Fly,They need someone to review the firearms; an episode had an optic placed backwards (eotech). It's immersion breaking for folks who do like some of this stuff. A little bit of research goes a long way. Small stuff like that eventually breaks shows because the new low is now the lowest standard. It trickles till things just get sloppy.
When Heroes Fly,HOW TF DID THIS SHOW GET GREENLIT FOR PRODUCTION?? 🤣🤣🤣🤦🏻‍♂️
When Heroes Fly,"And of course, the two TEENAGE REBEL LEADERS… are lesbians!🤡 BAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHHAHAHAHHAAAAAAAAA 🤦🏻‍♂️"
When Heroes Fly,"I turned it off on the mountain fight scene in the first episode. I’m normally super into this kind of stuff, but it was just poorly done that I couldn’t force myself to continue.

Also, the dialogue is awful… goodness"
When Heroes Fly,"> Wrong actors, no chemistry

I have to agree with this assessment in spades and add in bad directing as well. This is awful to watch; I doubt I'm going to make it to the end of the the 2nd episode."
When Heroes Fly,"I had a hard time taking Strike Back seriously.  I thought it was pretty cheesy to be honest.  Im surprised we are even comparing the two.  Strike Back much more inferior in terms of acting, production, character development etc."
When Heroes Fly,How similar is it to Strike Back though? I’ve missed watching a straight action show like that.
When Heroes Fly,"Start at military academy, serve during wartime, spend 37 years active duty, retire, become president. Rake in the sweet president salary along side your lifetime O-10 General of the Army Pay.

Helps if you're named Eisenhower."
When Heroes Fly,"The younger soldier (husband) comes from a rich family. His mom says “your rich friend” when talking to the brother at the wedding. In episode 2 the husband says to her brother something like - “no offense but part of you is still a kid from the sticks, I know you’re all enamored when you’re in the same room as a 3 star but when I was a kid we had CIA directors at our dinner table begging us for crumbs. I know how these decisions are made”. So he obviously comes from a family with a lot of means and power. All that said, I find it funny he comes from those kinds of means and is a delta operator, but is still totally oblivious his wife works for the cia."
When Heroes Fly,The Alexs/princes father is a Major Weapons Contractor.
When Heroes Fly,"Yeah this was bland. 
In all honestly I’m not fussed if JR is about nukes and Russians, my issue with both the last 2 seasons of that is that it’s been executed so badly"
When Heroes Fly,"Totally agree. There are shows that do military TTPs well (*Terminal List*, *Six*, *The Unit*, *Fauda*, hell even early *Strike Back* had good transitions and manipulation) and this ain’t one of them. Wonder who they had as their consultants. Boal ran *The Hurt Locker* and *Zero Dark Thirty* so you’d think he should have known better."
When Heroes Fly,"Funny thing is at first episode, how come spec ops failed GPS with drone? LOL"
When Heroes Fly,In my book if I can’t get through 2 episodes then it’s dead tbh
When Heroes Fly,"Fauda? Love that show

Edit: Lol nvm. But would still recommend Fauda to any/all who enjoy this genre."
When Heroes Fly,Tehran?
When Heroes Fly,"Exactly this. And those scenes of flowing water and nature wtf? Music like from a boutique store. Halfway the second episode I gave up. So slow, poor dialogues. I can clearly see where it is going. My prediction: authorities do not approve the attack, our heroes go on their own, kill all the bad guys without a scratch and save the princess. Everybody goes home."
When Heroes Fly,Yeah just finished it there. Snooze through all of that season for two intense episodes and that ending. Total garbage haha
When Heroes Fly,"That’s why I’m here, too. Anyone?"
When Heroes Fly,Use the mic on the Google app to recognize the song.
When Heroes Fly,"It’s stated a few times he’s rich. It’s a plot point. He even uses his surname “Haas”. It’s also on the plane. Google Haas. Huge company and very rich person.

Edit huge company. Not family. Wonder if Gene Haas got paid to use his name in this show? 🤔"
When Heroes Fly,"Because those smartass guerilla thought someone carrying mil grade labeled gps beacon can be a spy, they dont just assume, they made themselves believe she is a spy. We wont know how ""smart"" can they be. Hahaha"
When Heroes Fly,"Spoiler:


His father is a weapons contractor. 
His wife is also a CIA subcontractor."
When Heroes Fly,"Special forces teams have murdered each other to cover crimes, what are you talking about?"
When Heroes Fly,"Contrast this to *SEAL Team* where the team leader (due to TBI) forgets they found explosives in a part of the building and tries to breach a door near it with, you guessed it, explosives. Nearly blows his entire team to pieces and they all wind up in the hospital.

When they piece it together, what happens? No pissy treatise, no acrimony, nada. They rallied around him even though *HIS* error nearly killed them.

> special forces teams are so bonded to each other this would never happen

And if it did *need* to happen, it'd be behind closed doors, with just the team, and absolutely not in a public place with *someone who is not part of the team*, family or not."
When Heroes Fly,Congrats on choosing to see the obvious in your face theme 🤷‍♂️
When Heroes Fly,"Yeah, and I just about cracked up after that scene in the barrio...

After the Colombian Commander just finished telling them about all the spotters, shooters, and support network that the baddies had crawling all around that area; somehow these 2 guys were able to take a taxi cab with assault rifles in hand out in the open, infiltrate the house, shoot a few guys on their way out, and then just walk out of there with the rifles slung on their shoulders??? 

Just another day in Colombia I guess!?  C'mon!!"
When Heroes Fly,The kiwi wasn’t playing an American he was playing a former kiwi SF soldier now working for princes dads company
When Heroes Fly,"I could care less about a scene with backwards optics , if they would just fix the silly hollywood silencer bullshit. They can call an M4 a freaking AK-47 and call a MP5 an AR-15 all day long all season long over and over again and people will loose their shit over that…but they just accept the suppressed long guns sound quieter than a freaking BB gun🙄🙄🤦‍♂️"
When Heroes Fly,"I’m at that scene now, and the music is TERRIBLE! It sounds like something you’d hear in a boutique store in Arizona.

EDIT: And, I’m sorry, but I just don’t buy that they would call up a Special Ops squad that they know is at a wedding for a mission that’s going to happen the very next day. Not to even mention the fact that one of the members of said squad is the groom!

Edit: And an active Specs Op soldier is going to run for Senate? I mean, presumably, he would retire first - but not even start as a Congressman?

Final edit: Just finished episode one. Yea, not continuing on with this one"
When Heroes Fly,"I was like ""wouldn't a thermal imager be pretty useful?  They must have left em with the snow shoes..."""
When Heroes Fly,Throughout the first episode I skipped all the interpersonal drama. It felt forced and unnatural.
When Heroes Fly,"Strike Back doesn’t take itself seriously, has far better action, and some great villains."
When Heroes Fly,"This has even worse acting and lines. cab't believe this is the same writer that was an Oscar favorite.

It's like they hear what money Apple is offering and they rush to adapt some series they've watched or heard of without much finesse or grit."
When Heroes Fly,"Strike Back is not meant to be taken seriously - it is a glorious action adventure bromance with guns, explosions, and fierce women!"
When Heroes Fly,Only 2 episodes in and it’s not really that similar. This seems to take itself more seriously and attempt to have some more depth.
When Heroes Fly,"I was going to say. If he was just a Westpoint grad serving as a high ranking civilian officer, then maybe. But for him to be an actual soldier is completely unrealistic. This entire show feels like Apple just has money to waste and is throwing it at anyone who is willing to take it. 200 Billion in overseas cash reserves. They need to prove the are actually losing money so the IRS will leave them alone."
When Heroes Fly,"They didnt even try. The rescue scene also has so many stupid parts to it.

**Spoilers below:

In embassy bunker: “is she a fighter?” 

Brother: “Best you have ever seen!”

Rescue: *stands there like an idiot and gets taken* 

Who tf hugs someone in the open ground with baddies in the area?! 

And also you see 3 guys start of scene one gets shot then main character gets shot by a guy hiding a truck they supposedly cleared and the last guy just disappears? They can snipe from miles away multiple targets with extreme precision so accurately they have to hide under blankets but bad guys come back out in the open to grab her and dont get shot now? 

Its so mind numbingly dumb it hurts my brain."
When Heroes Fly,"Even their comms discipline is so bad, it feels and sounds like a bunch of 10 year olds playing in the backyard!  These guys are supposed to be Delta?!?  Ya right!"
When Heroes Fly,Right?! Come on
When Heroes Fly,Fauda is really good. Fauda with dubbed voices has better dialogue
When Heroes Fly,When Hero’s Fly.
When Heroes Fly,"What’s great is u would think that,  but what they actually did was so so so much worse. I e made it to episode 7 bc I’m bored and unable to stop watching the shittiness. The writing is outrageously poor, not just because the dialogue is terrible but bc the plot is 100% implausible at all times.

They tried rescuing the princess, failed, Prince (his actual name) gets shot, goes home and starts getting head from another woman while his wife rota in a Venezuelan black site and Bambi sticks around to try to rescue her but becomes a fisherman and hard core drunk instead. That’s about three episodes btw.

We finally get something kind of interesting when Amber almost resumes herself and no, she’s captured and another prisoner killed whom she’s befriended bc of her escape attempt and bc she wasn’t tough enough to kill someone to get out. That’s as close as we get to plausible. 

This show sucks so bad.

I’m episode 7, mom shows up in Colombia and they bring her to house where they’re holding a major politician’s younger brother hostage but yet going out in the world for like take-out and shit - so covert! - and Mom gets out a machine gun, starts shower, turns up radio like she’s waiting for an ambush and - wait for it - they get ambushed and she shoots the last guy. Bambi decided to send his traumatized mother home. WT everloving F?

Why did she come? Why did they take her to hostage house? Why are they treating hostage house like it’s just an AirBnB? Why did she fake get in the shower and turn up radio if she had no idea an ambush was coming and why do that anyway bc that makes it easier for them to ambush you? Why did she get out gun ahead of time? None of this makes ANY sense st all."
When Heroes Fly,"New episode is out, there are KIA team mates."
When Heroes Fly,"Indeed, is a total disappointment, a waste of good spec ops material."
When Heroes Fly,Yeah if I'm not mistaken his father is a weapons contractor for the US?
When Heroes Fly,They are part of the same unit.  You have one guy who is pouting for awhile before condemning his brother in arms for an op going wrong when he is actually the reason why everything went all wrong.  It's just the high school soap opera vision of a special ops thriller.  They may as well should be arguing over who used the last roll of toilet paper.  It's just a joke...
When Heroes Fly,"Thank you.  Sometimes on these threads I start to wonder ior worry that at sone point f I've quietly switched places with some other version of myself in a different dimension where my subtext and cultural references are incongruous with everyone who are at home there...

I feel relieved to hear someone reframe what I was hoping to discuss in a helpful way.

I grew up in a household where I never had the honor of serving but my father was from rhat world.  So the men and women in our armed forces deserve faithful representation at the very least.  If nothing else I think we can try to do them proud with accurate and credible stories of the kind of service and sacrifice that isn't as common as it was once.  

I think it deserves to be revered.
I really loved rhe terminal list.  Something about that movie really moved me.  But this apple series Echo 3 just turned me.off twice before i reached the halfway mark in the first episode.  No promise it can offer is enough to forgive how awful that writing is.

Anyway... has there been any other recent series or films which do provide insight and respect on military service that you've  have seen?

I'm definitely aware of the void left bu the echo 3 disapointmwnt..."
When Heroes Fly,Incorrect.  I'm talking about BAMBI; he is an actual KIWI Actor.
When Heroes Fly,"Agreed with you on all accounts. Also, their decision-making and communications are C tier movie caliber. Not to mention their weapons sound and look like cheap air soft models. lol. This one is going to be a hard pass for me."
When Heroes Fly,"> And an active Specs Op soldier is going to run for Senate? I mean, presumably, he would retire first - but not even start as a Congressman

TBF Eisenhower didn't retire until he won the New Hampshire primary. He did not run for congress or senate before running for President. So, its not without a similar precedent."
When Heroes Fly,I would say it has more action but I’m not sure if would call it better.  Strike back action sequences feel rushed and you rarely sense that the protagonists are in danger. I just remember being not very impressed with the realism and attention to detail. In Echo 3 movements and action sequences feel very tactical and purposeful.  The cover and move sequences when two protagonists break into the suspected kidnappers hideout is just awesome.
When Heroes Fly,Agree to disagree. I thought the acting was great.
When Heroes Fly,And it fails more as a result.
When Heroes Fly,Yeah there’s so many wtf moments.  Spoiler alert but in episode three a bomb goes off and the military up and leaves the people responsible for the act while they had them surrounded.  They then helicopter out of the jungle after having them contained only to 5 minutes later change their mind and go back to pursuing the gang.  The husband then rescues his wife but after all his military training decides to hug her for 10 minutes out in the open.  There’s dumb then there is this show.  How did the producers allow this shit to happen?
When Heroes Fly,"Ohh, got it, thanks"
When Heroes Fly,"> Why did she fake get in the shower and turn up radio if she had no idea an ambush was coming and why do that anyway bc that makes it easier for them to ambush you?

She heard the gunshots. Over the radio AND the TV. They're Special Forces but they don't put alarms on doors or lock them. They're special all right.

Also, ""I cheated on your sister, we good now?"" ""Yeh"""
When Heroes Fly,Im glad im not the only one that cant watch shows out of pure rage hate 🤣
When Heroes Fly,All of this! The whole 10 mins of the mom makes absolute zero sense. Don’t even get me started on the wife’s acting. So many weird physical movements and weird shit she says. Just bad all around. At this point I’m just hate watching lol
When Heroes Fly,">Anyway... has there been any other recent series or films which do provide insight and respect on military service that you've  have seen?

I think SEAL Team does an outstanding job on this front.  The tactical ops are so well done in that show, and at the same time during their 'down time' between ops they feature some really good perspectives on what these guys deal with in real life (TBI-traumatic brain injury, headaches, personal identity issues when they stop operating, supporting other Vets recoveries, etc.).  All of it is so very well done, highly recommended!"
When Heroes Fly,"Yea, but he was a five-star general."
When Heroes Fly,"Strike Back had far more realistic action. Yes - it is improbable in the xtreme nature - but the physicality was real. They has a number of British SAS guys advising the show and everything from the guns to tactics was apparently real. But of course, the sheer number of bad guys and bullets wasn't. But that's what made Strike Back AWESOME."

"How clumsy you are, Miss Ueno.","I don't play video games.

* Pedro Pascal is one of the few actors I'd watch eating mashed potatoes.
* Trailer looks awesome.
* I loved The Walking Dead and World War Z. I welcome another Zombie dystopia... or at least this is what I think it is (don't spoil it if it isn't)
* I Trust HBO... this is what good programing do to a brand."
"How clumsy you are, Miss Ueno.",I’ve never gotten around to playing it but it’s my wife’s favorite game. I’ve been looking forward to experiencing it without the game as a reference.
"How clumsy you are, Miss Ueno.",I’ve only heard of the game through ads but know nothing of the game. Excited for the show though.
"How clumsy you are, Miss Ueno.","I didn’t know about the video game till I saw previews and I was told it was based on video game. 

I am exited for the show because of cast and because it is set in apocalyptic world ( is it??? I am not 100 percent sure, but I liked previews)"
"How clumsy you are, Miss Ueno.","I've heard of it. Never played it. Never will. Not a gamer.

But I'm excited for the show, as I'm a fan of Pascal and Craig Mazin."
"How clumsy you are, Miss Ueno.",I had never heard of the game and I am mildly interested in the show.
"How clumsy you are, Miss Ueno.","My parents don't play video games. They have never heard of The Last of Us. They saw a trailer for the show before an episode of House of the Dragon. My mom asked me if I'd heard of it, saying it looked cool and they might watch it. Which was funny to me because it's my favorite video game."
"How clumsy you are, Miss Ueno.","Giving how popular games are nowadays, specially Playstation big IPs, I think it's very unlikely people who already know about the show never heard about the game before.

That being said, since I like TLoU more for the story and characters rather than gameplay, I think it could indeed make a pretty good show. Specially on HBOs hands."
"How clumsy you are, Miss Ueno.","I am. I am not into video games at all, unless they're of the Tetris variety, but I love post-apocalyptic stories, so I am looking forward to trying this show out."
"How clumsy you are, Miss Ueno.","I know of the game and some of the basic plot but I've never played it, probably never will since I'm not big into story based games.

I'm excited mostly for Craig Mazin"
"How clumsy you are, Miss Ueno.",I’ve never played but I know the entire plot line of the game as well as the prequel and sequel. It should do pretty well
"How clumsy you are, Miss Ueno.","I've heard of it, but never played it. By what I know, it sounds like it would be good TV material."
"How clumsy you are, Miss Ueno.","Heard of the game, just never got around to playing it. I’ll probably play it after season 1 ends. Honestly just excited for the show because it sounds like it’s going to be really well done, and it’s on HBO which I trust to handle the story."
"How clumsy you are, Miss Ueno.","Have anyone seen the movie 'The girl with all the gifts'?

It's the closest I've seen to a Last of Us movie."
"How clumsy you are, Miss Ueno.","I've actually played it but gave up a few hours in and sold my copy of the game...  which I never did.

It was a real love-hate relationship.  I fell in love with every cutscene and grew to hate the game when it came to its gameplay...  Eventually, the hate won out, and I moved to other games.

I am very interested in the show.  Will likely pick up HBO Max at some point to watch it."
"How clumsy you are, Miss Ueno.",I’ve played both games and can’t wait to see people reactions. I don’t play many games but that series is easily one of the best I’ve ever played
"How clumsy you are, Miss Ueno.","Heard of the game, will never play it, and likely won’t watch the show. I haven’t heard any excitement about the show really."
"How clumsy you are, Miss Ueno.",No interest in video games and I wouldn't say I'm *excited* but I am curious.
"How clumsy you are, Miss Ueno.","I'm expecting prestige Resident Evil. If that's what it is, I'm here for it."
"How clumsy you are, Miss Ueno.","Also the voice/mo cap actors for Joel and Ellie make a cameo in the series. Troy Baker as a henchman, Ashley Johnson as a woman trying in the trailer after (assuming) giving birth."
"How clumsy you are, Miss Ueno.",Never played it
"How clumsy you are, Miss Ueno.",I've always wanted Cormac McCarthy's The Road to be made into a TV series. This TLoU adaptation is the closest I'll probably get to have that wish come true.
"How clumsy you are, Miss Ueno.","I haven't played it since no playstation, but I look forward to watching it / playing it when ported to pc."
"How clumsy you are, Miss Ueno.",I never played the game though I am a video gamer. Not really excited but expect it will be good and will watch it when it comes out.
"How clumsy you are, Miss Ueno.","Not a gamer at all (the last Naughty Dog game I ever played because my sister was into it was Crash Bandicoot :-).   But if Craig Mazin's showrunning it, I'm in. I've been listening to [Scriptnotes](https://johnaugust.com/scriptnotes) ever since *Chernobyl...*"
"How clumsy you are, Miss Ueno.","I have never played the video game, haven’t played video games since high school (I’d barely even heard of the last of us), and honestly my natural reaction to hearing about this show was to roll my eyes because I’m not interested in nerd culture and was annoyed that super talented people’s efforts were being spent on a video game TV show. 

Id say I’m much more interesting in watching it than I’m excited about it. I really like a lot of the people involved and HBO seems to be really getting behind it and they rarely seem to miss when they back something so I’m trusting them to make something I’ll like or at the very least appreciate but may not be for me."
"How clumsy you are, Miss Ueno.","I’ve heard of The Last of Us, and I’ve intentionally avoided it because of that.  But, I’m pretty sure the TV version is going to suck me in."
"How clumsy you are, Miss Ueno.",You’ll definitely love it
"How clumsy you are, Miss Ueno.",It is.
"How clumsy you are, Miss Ueno.",[removed]
"How clumsy you are, Miss Ueno.",I have never played the game but have heard how amazing it is and I am thoroughly excited for the TV show. I’m hoping this can be the first show that does a game justice.
"How clumsy you are, Miss Ueno.",I havent seen it but just looked it up. Sounds interesting altho eerily similar in scope regarding TLOU virus.
"How clumsy you are, Miss Ueno.","Ahhh, no kidding? I didn't know anything about the game other than what I've read about in stuff about the show. But I really liked The Girl With All the Gifts so now I'm looking forward to this one."
"How clumsy you are, Miss Ueno.",That’s an excellent movie.
"How clumsy you are, Miss Ueno.","I've played the game many times and have also compared it to the road, but after awhile I decided to overall tone and world is more similar to children of men"
"How clumsy you are, Miss Ueno.","I get where you’re coming from. But imo, besides for being a video game, there is nothing nerdy about it. My fiancée doesn’t like video games but regularly requested to watch me play TLoU because she was so invested in the story."
"How clumsy you are, Miss Ueno.",I am curious if your opinion changed on the show now that season 1 has finished
"How clumsy you are, Miss Ueno.",It's basically if Ellie was taken in by the Firefly instead of Joel.  Even the virus & zombies are similar to the game.
"How clumsy you are, Miss Ueno.","i really enjoyed it! haven't seen the finale yet, but its been a fun ride! Not a contender for the all time great tv show conversation by any means, but clearly incredibly well made and acted.

revisions,"Jesus Christ! 

A) learn how metacritic works. Critics normally only get a few episodes of a season of tv to review so the metacritic scores are of limited value for telly. 

B) the critics have seen the show. You have not. So your opinion is absolutely meaningless"
revisions,"Oh yay another complaining about critics post. You guys know you can watch what you want and what entertains you? You know, not being insecure about your opinions?"
revisions,">Why not just have a bunch of individuals with separate interesting opinions, instead of attached to everyone having the same opinion like mentally weak collectivists. 

why are you using metacritc then? you want ""separate interesting opinions"" but use a platform that doesn't offer that.  

&#x200B;

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metacritic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metacritic)

Metacritic is a website that **aggregates reviews of films**, television shows, music albums, video games, and formerly books. For each product, the scores from each review are averaged (a weighted average). Metacritic was created by Jason Dietz, Marc Doyle, and Julie Doyle Roberts in 1999, and is owned by Fandom, Inc. as of 2023.

Metacritic won two Webby Awards for excellence as an aggregation website. **It is regarded as the foremost online review aggregation site for the video game industry.**

&#x200B;

Lasso has consistently high scores on Rotten Tomatoes - (Tomatometer 90+% all 3 seasons)

at least they're much more transparent about who gets to be called a ""critic"" in the first place. ""published"" does not mean a random blog you own. they have viewership, readership, and circulation, requirements for whatever publication you ***work*** for.

Individual professional film and TV critics who are Tomatometer-approved and whose reviews are included on the site regardless of where they are **published**.

&#x200B;

Tomatometer-approved publications, such as websites, online video outlets, newspapers, consumer and trade magazines, alt-weeklies, podcasts, radio programs, and TV shows. If a publication is approved, its review of a movie or show is included on the Tomatometer® regardless of which individual critic produced it.  


Critics who wish to apply should first review our guidelines below. All candidates will go through a vetting process and be evaluated against our criteria. Applications are accepted yearly during the month of March."
revisions,"The one thing I learned about critics is, if they absolutely love something, there is a good chance I won't like it. If they are on the fence, I might not think it's the greatest but I might find it enjoyable."
revisions,"It a odd.

This is probably one of the most angriest subs on Reddit. That’s odd. Because it’s television. Politics I get…television not so much."
revisions,"Do you really think there was a chance Ted Lasso's reviews would go up from season 2?

I will give you another LOCK that I would bet my life savings on. Andor's reviews in season 2 will be amazing and way higher than its metacritic of 74 in season 1.

In reality, there should be 50/50 chance that Andor has a worse season 2 than 1, and the fans response in the end may end up being 50/50 better or worse. But in this case the reviews are absoultely guaranteed to go to the moon in season 2. Because Andor is now ""trendy"" and they never got a chance in season 1 to show how much they love Andor. So they will fall all over themselves for it in season 2."
revisions,"I wouldn't be surprised if 7/10 is how I feel about Ted Lasso season 3, so the score is not the problem, however whatever people's opinions, I wish for it to be for the right reasons, and copying other critics opinions cause it feels good to them (?) when everyone on social media has the same opinion is not the right reason.

As for the impact of TV critics having a weak process, especially in streaming quantity era it will affect fate of how some shows are remembered and watched in the future and others disappear into the void, TV canon, renewal/cancellation, etc. A show like The Wire has a lot to owe TV critics in mid 2000s for keeping it alive and giving it a reputation for many years in the future."

revisions,"A Charlie Brown Christmas has been hailed as a staple of the Christmas season for decades since it aired in '65, and launched a legacy for Peanuts as a franchise and a generation of animators. Ironically, it was commissioned by The Coca-Cola Company, and if not for this mega-corporation, this anti-commercialization-of-Christmas special would not exist. Their sponsorship tags would be cut from subsequent broadcasts, although the studio also used this to their benefit to correct the clearest and most fixable animation errors they could notice (while adding a few more in, ironically), the end result having been a disaster in the eyes of Melendez and New York executives in the first place.  



 The version that has been broadcast and remastered since is the revised version, while the original print would not be screened ever again except during special screenings from an vintage 16mm print. One of these prints was offered to ParamountCartoons, member of the Internet Animation Database forums, who dissected as much as he could from this version, and the print was soon shared as an MKV at the Lost Media Wiki for all to enjoy and dissect, and in this video will be compared in split-screen with the changes made in the final cut."

The sound was much better and music was done much more effectively in the new version. Go to 16:23.  You can't tell me that it's much better than the original. Bringing Charlie out of he background, revealing the detail that was put into those matte paintings and adding more scale and clarity to the scene as opposed to the flattened original version."

Edit: The animation of the original was also pretty sketchy. Low budget. That's part of the piece at this point."

revisions,"You can download the original from the Lost Media Wiki, if you follow the superscripts. It's a MEGA link. I'd post it, but I'm not sure how this subreddit would be with the link. The original is far superior even with its small imperfections. The coloring is much better. It's a shame that there are so many artifacts in the original, though.

revisions,Thanks i’ll check that out :)
revisions,Gotta be nostalgia glasses. There's no way you could say the new one looks objectively worse.
revisions,"The backgrounds are flat grey instead of blue at the beginning of the cartoon. The original looks like a painting. The remake looks flat and like it was rendered in MSPaint. Sometimes making things ""sharp"" detracts.

And ok. I will. At 16:23. The original looks like one piece of art. Sure, the sky is a little blurred compared to the new and the snow is a bit redder, but Charlie doesn't look like a cartoon cell over a background like he does in the remake. He looks like he's part of the scene. Perhaps that red saturation was intentional on the part of the artists? It does make the snow look more textured."
revisions,Scratches caused by improper projection.
revisions,Am I the only one who is seeing the original as freaking purple toned everywhere? It looks awful.
revisions,"Not that, considering I just finished watching the original and have been exposed to the other my entire life. 

It's too sharp, the colors are too flat and the characters look like cartoon cells floating over the top of a background instead of being a part of the art. Go watch the full original version. Unfortunately it's very artifact heavy, but the coloring and everything else is much warmer and vibrant. The remake looks sterile."
revisions,"The red almost certainly was a part of the scan rather than the art and so was the blurring you think is making it seem like one thing. The problem is it's not one thing. it's a background, foreground and character and they should be distinct and easy to see.  Not blurred together by bad scanning. I'd be willing to be the original cells looked much closer to the revised version."
revisions,"Well, preference is preference I guess. But I certainly can't say I agree."
revisions,"Being over red shaded is sort of ""warmer and more vibrant"" I guess

And I suppose you could call ""not having skin tones literally the same color as the background"" ""cartoon cells floating over the top of a background instead of being a part of the art"""
revisions,"The red is due to Kodak film fading over the decades. The blurring may be either due to the scan, or due to the old transfer to 16mm (or an intermediate before that). But, as you say, the master surely didn't have those features. The restoration work they had to do back in the day wasn't related to those aspects, which are now what are catching everyone's eye due to the state of this print."
revisions,"The original cells probably did look exactly like that, but sometimes blurring things slightly makes things look better. Like some of the old video game techniques that were done specifically for CRTs. I still think the original looks warmer and not as sterile as the remake. Also, the added sound effects and such add nothing to the original. I highly recommend you watch the entire original. 

I don't understand why original pieces of animation and film isn't considered ok the way they were originally created. Why people keep thinking they can ""improve"" by messing with them and we're ok with that.

That original release was how they wanted to present their art. It wasn't due to the constraints of the tech. It was presented on national television in just that way for reasons. It should be preserved as such. Just like Lucas screwing with Star Wars. The original with the models is far more compelling."
revisions,"Usually i'd agree with you but with animation like that that was scanned in it's not the artists intent you were seeing. Scanning technology was bad, especially for low budget stuff. So the original art should be presented as originally intended. The music changes were likely due to last second editing changes due to tv schedules. So I'd disagree the original was how they actually intended"
revisions,"The red is due to fading in old release print film stock used at that time. Low fade positive print stock (LPP) wouldn't show up until 1981, and I'm not sure if that was used for 16mm prints. Red fade is extremely common on prints of that age, aside from technicolor ones."
revisions,"I still have a CRT for my SNES!

revisions,"Thanks.  Here is the info:

""Star Trek's pilot episode, ""The Cage"", was completed between November 1964 and January 1965, and starred Jeffrey Hunter as Captain Christopher Pike, Majel Barrett as Number One, and Leonard Nimoy as Spock. After the pilot was rejected by NBC as being ""too cerebral"" (among other complaints), Jeffrey Hunter chose to withdraw from the role of Pike when creator Gene Roddenberry was asked to produce a second pilot episode (""Where No Man Has Gone Before"") of which an edited version of the same name aired in 1966.

""The Cage"" never aired during Star Trek's original run on NBC. It was presented by Roddenberry as a black-and-white workprint at various science fiction conventions over the years after Star Trek's cancellation but was not released on home video until 1986 when Paramount Home Video produced a ""restored"" release of ""The Cage"" (a combination of the original black-and-white footage and color portions of the Season 1 episode ""The Menagerie"") complete with an introduction by Gene Roddenberry.

On October 4, 1988, Paramount Pictures aired a two-hour television special, hosted by Patrick Stewart, called The Star Trek Saga: From One Generation to the Next, which featured, for the first time, a full-color television presentation of ""The Cage"". In some markets, the special did not air until October 15, 1988. In the United States, ""The Cage"" was first released to DVD in December 2001. It was later included on the final disc in both the original and ""remastered"" Season 3 DVD box sets (listed with the original air date of October 15, 1988).

The also planned-as-pilot ""Where No Man Has Gone Before"" in its original form (production number 02a) had been forwarded to NBC, but only a re-worked, re-edited, re-formatted, cut version was later aired under the same name, not as a pilot but as the third episode of the series (production number 02b). Afterwards, over the years the original ""alternate"" version was thought to be lost but later appeared as bootleg VHS tapes at conventions, until a print of it was discovered in 2009 and subsequently released on home video under the title ""Where No Fan Has Gone Before"" - The Restored, Unaired Alternate Pilot Episode as part of the TOS season 3 box set on Blu-ray; it has not been released on DVD yet. This version remains unaired."""""

Workin Moms,"Wife and I enjoy this show. But yeah, 7 seasons is a good stopping point."
Workin Moms,Catherine Reitman is really funny and talented. She was my outside hope to be cast for She-Hulk before Tatiana was cast.
Workin Moms,Probably for the best. Hasn't been funny for a while. Loved the first season though.
Workin Moms,"The creator and star is brilliant.  And I never call for shows to end, because even a weak season of a good show is better than nothing.

But if I'm being honest the quality has dropped for a few seasons."
Workin Moms,All I see is a cat
Workin Moms,They took away the puppy.
Workin Moms,"The earlier seasons are awesome for rewatches but it definitely became unrealistic and weird by season 5.

Catherine Reitman is very talented and I hope she continues working after the show."
Workin Moms,"It’s a great show and fun to see a Canadian perspective. I think it’s hilarious and shocking. If I wanted a regular/ non offensive show, I would watch a sitcom on network tv. The show creator is a genius."
Workin Moms,Definitely a guilty pleasure show. And I definitely skip through all of Jenny’s parts because I can’t stand her character :)
Workin Moms,Catherine Reitman also had a reoccurring appearance on Black-ish as one of the people in the ad agency where Dre worked.
Workin Moms,"Been a great show, good to wrap up instead of drag out."
Workin Moms,Idk what it is but I absolutely cannot stand this show. Everybody is awful but it's not funny.
Workin Moms,[deleted]
Workin Moms,This is the first time I've heard of this show.
Workin Moms,Million dollar smile on her
Workin Moms,"Damn y’all are brutal! Lol 
I guess I just liked it bc it made me feel less dysfunctional with my measley 3 months of maternity leave 😅😂"
Workin Moms,"Wife and I really enjoyed the first few seasons, but this show went off the damn rails.  I had to stop watching it, while my wife kept going a bit longer before she couldn't handle it anymore either."
Workin Moms,It smells like she’s been nibbling on little pieces of shit!!
Workin Moms,Dead tooth!
Workin Moms,I told you I was willing to change.
Workin Moms,"I would agree 100 percent.  Her friend I feel like is in a race to the bottom with the Instagram wanna be mom regarding who is the worst parent out of everyone on the show.  It got to the point around the gun plot that I was hate watching it, and just yelling at the screen with my own wife that we gave up on the show."
Workin Moms,"This was one of those shows that was recommended to me by other moms I know, but it was just not funny and they’re all assholes - but not funny assholes.  It was just bad."
Workin Moms,May I suggest cleansing your pallet of this show with some Bluey?
Workin Moms,"I recommend the show (also on Netflix, but from Australia) called The Let Down. Similar premise but the characters aren't all horrible people who plainly don't care about the actual kids."
Workin Moms,She looks like a sassy fish in an old school Disney animated feature.
Workin Moms,"The first two or so seasons were fun, after that everyone just seemed to be come more rude, mean, vile, and overall unlikeable. All redeeming qualities for the characters seemed to go out the window and I just couldn't bring myself to watch it anymore. Was really bummed when I realized what was happening."
Workin Moms,The therapist ex-boyfriend hypnotism bullshit was my jumping off point.
Workin Moms,Second season when she tried to adopt a youth persona to fit in as a marketer was great.
Workin Moms,So representation means totally shutting out some groups? Yikes.
Workin Moms,So hop on over to r/todayilearned and tell everyone about it.
Workin Moms,The nipple placement is crazy
Workin Moms,"Yeah but I didn’t know you meant physically, that you’d change physically. *Why weren’t you more clear with me, Maureen?!*"
Workin Moms,"Which would be fine if there were actual consequences (funny or otherwise) to their actions.  And the plot scenarios that they set up all just so damned contrived.  Supporting characters completely change their personalities just to make convenient outs for the main characters.  Like the guy Kate was seeing when she was split up with her psycho husband*. The guy was a knight in shining armour until it was time to reconcile her marriage, and conveniently the other guy turns on a dime into an out of control and arrogant alcoholic.

*Kate’s cheating husband plot line was so terribly written they couldn’t have been planning it.  The husband is just calmly cheating without any guilt or indication until he gets caught and yet we are supposed to now see him as the nice guy he was portrayed as before the affair even though he’s clearly a sociopath for doing what he did without betraying a shred of guilty conscience. The whole series reeks of ‘made up as they go along.’   I also really scoffed at their ‘Covid season, which consisted of the season premiere and then nothing."
Workin Moms,"I agree, it's not that they are assholes, it's that there are no real consequences, funny or otherwise, for their actions.  Just contrived and conveniently undone consequences.  I don't care if Kate narrowly escapes some professional/personal*  calamity with her wits, because I don't particularly like her as a person, and I really don't like her friends or her terrible, worthless husband.  But the writers seem to assume we all just love these people in spite of their behaviours."
Workin Moms,Bluey is always what the doctor ordered 😊
Workin Moms,"I also recommend a similar show ""Girlfriends guide to divorce""."
Workin Moms,Yeah pretty much. Every character became totally hateful.
Workin Moms,They were never nice people in The League but I felt the same in that show. It just kept getting more and more mean-spirited within the group as the show went on.
Workin Moms,Sounds like Always Sunny
Workin Moms,I’d say actual working moms are pretty poorly represented in this ridiculous show.  The characters talk passively about ‘money problems’ but otherwise live pretty financially well off lives in Toronto. But they do not live very believable lives.
Workin Moms,[deleted]
Workin Moms,If she wasn’t related to Ivan Reitman this show wouldn’t be a thing.
Workin Moms,"I think Sunny gets away with it because the characters are cartoon-like, whereas this show tries to play things a little more grounded."
Workin Moms,"Sir, this is a television sub"

Workin Moms,Never heard of it
Workin Moms,I liked it a lot.
Workin Moms,"Lack of advertising honestly
Just luck of the draw on which shows are more pushed.  

I watched the first episode after reading your post and it has a lot of potential.  But today is last day of netflix subscription so don't want to get invested.

Definitely recommending it to one of my friends since show is right up her alley.

Great cast."
Workin Moms,I can see that now hahaha
Workin Moms,It’s a Canadian show. It’s on Netflix in the UK. Check it out
Workin Moms,Looks like Netflix for the US too.  I hadn't heard of it till now.  I'll add it to the watch list. 🙂
Workin Moms,Season 4 is coming in 2020. (Canadian show on CBC that airs it before Netflix).
Workin Moms,"Val the teacher (blonde woman in the thumbnail) is hilarious, and I hope they continue the trend from s3 of giving her more screentime in s4."
Workin Moms,They’re all terrible people.
Workin Moms,"The CBC has really nailed it with a few of their sitcoms in recent years. Workin Moms, Schitt's Creek and Kim's Convenience are all really well done."
Workin Moms,It's a CBC original but whatever makes you feel better Netflix :)
Workin Moms,"I don’t know why you’re getting downvoted for this. I love Val, she’s hysterical"
Workin Moms,"And so are all the people in Sunny and that show is hilarious, it's much more fun to watch awful people do awful shit"
Workin Moms,"Yeah but Jenny is the worst, I think we can all agree on that."
Workin Moms,That’s what makes it great!!!
Workin Moms,That's the point much like other shows about terrible people being terrible.
Workin Moms,And the article doesn’t say otherwise. It was OP that changed the headline.
Workin Moms,"In OPs defense, this show comes up as ""Netflix original"" here in Australia and I guess other regions too. Netflix seems to do this with shows they have first access to (e.g. The Good Place airs week to week here but is branded a Netflix original)"
Workin Moms,Oh most definitely.
Workin Moms,"They do

Better Call Saul's intro was altered. Instead of ""AMC"" it abruptly cuts to ""A Netflix Original"""
Workin Moms,">The Woman In The House Across the Street from the Girl in the Window 

that's a damn long title"
Workin Moms,Interesting! I imagine Resident Evil must be on the chopping block for sure.
Workin Moms,still pissed they cancelled archive 81
Workin Moms,Where is Arcane on this list? Or did you start on the new year
Workin Moms,Where's Heartstopper? That seemed to be much more popular than many of these shows and was defnintely in the top 10 for weeks
Workin Moms,I mean I wouldnt have minded seeing the worldwide numbers
Workin Moms,"It's a parody show, so the title is intentionally very long. I loved it and found it hilarious"
Workin Moms,It's doing ok but if it has a high budget maybe that's not enough.
Iron Ladies,"However different our tastes may be, I think it's great how you always seem to put such a lot of effort into your writings.

I've got a question, though.

>Shows categorized based on originality, creativity and innovation

It's not easy reconciling the above with some of your actual ratings: *Firefly Lane* (just as an example, I haven't seen it) you give a 6.8 - a rating you subsequently explain by calling the show ""forgettable"", and by saying it ""does nothing to stand out"".

So... How can a show seemingly so wholly lacking in originality, creativity, and innovation *measured by those very same categories* still get a 6.8? Shouldn't it be more like, I dunno, a 2? Or do you count up to 100? How exactly did you arrive at the (very precise!) number 6.8?"
Iron Ladies,The best show this year was mare of east town
Iron Ladies,"For all Mankind was epic, Invincible was great too"
Iron Ladies,"Hacks is good, that's pretty much the only one I've been interested in."
Iron Ladies,Many links to your own posts.
Iron Ladies,"Vincenzo is AMAZING, deserves to be added, although it might be a 2020 release"

Dom is a very hard series to label '*good*' or '*bad*'. It certainly holds your attention throughout, with it's emotional stories about addiction, exciting burglary scenes, intriguing drug busts operations and gorgeous locations, but it's all so disjointed and incoherently written.

&#x200B;

Porni doesn't do too bad at accomplishing what it sets out to accomplish. It's a very genuine and relatable series about motherhood, there just isn't anything here that makes it stick out. Not the plot, not the characters, not anything really.

&#x200B;

Mare of Easttown is by all means a well put together series, my issue is there's not an ounce of originality to be found here. It's too typical a '*whodunnit*' detective mystery-drama, in the same style and execution we've seen a million times already. The performances and character work act as saving grace, but at the same time its not like we haven't seen character work or emotional weight of this magnitude before.

&#x200B;

Genera+ion does have potential, but so far, besides it being more LGBTQ+ centric, hasn't branched out beyond being the average teen show. They do have opportunity to make some audacious and daring decisions here with a very strong group of characters, whether or not they will capitalize, we'll see, but Genera+ion definitely needs something to stand out. Crazy enough the best episode here so far is the one directed by Lena Dumhum. From her 'Girls' days she's always been a master of making great episodes that are literally about nothing.

This one falls into '*so bad it's good*' territories. A series that's bat shit crazy, overly dramatic and unpredictable in the sense that the writers don't give fuck all about consistency, cohesion... or logic. Mexican telenovela at its finest.

&#x200B;

The most creatively ambitious work the MCU has put out so far, but not fully committing to its more ambitious ideas lead it to falling into familiar 'formulaic superhero' territories by the end of it.

A psychological-thriller that's fascinating... baffling... and bat-shit crazy! I'm not sure what to even say the premise of this is. What starts out as a 'unconventional love-triangle', develops into something so... left-field. The writing is more in line with a soap-opera, but it's one of the most unpredictable stories I've ever seen if you ask me.

Following a group of friends from the year they met while *walking the camino*, to different period in their life throughout the years where they would walk it again and again, 3 Caminos is centered around the Camino de Santiago and feels very much like an advertisement for the ""spiritual"", ""life-changing"" walk. Apparently it's funded by the European Tourism Board, and that will put things into perspective when you watch it, but besides having to hear the word ""Camino"" over and over again the series does have its upsides. Its stunning visuals and scenery for one, also its very calm and tranquil atmosphere, plus the feeling you get at the end, like you've just finished watching something very profound, meaningful and life-changing... even though you haven't."
Iron Ladies,">Inspired by the true life story of Christiane F., unlike the 1981 film Wir Kinder vom Bahnof Zoo takes a more stylistic approach, modernizing the 1970s with contemporary music, glossy visuals and unexpected surrealism as it tells the tragic story of kids on drugs.

Not with you on that. But, I read the book for at least 5 times, and maybe find it hard to separate. Still, I feel its a bit a case of many overwritten drama shows. In the book - which I found a much tougher read today as back then when parents and teachers used it as anti-drug-pamphlet - there is foucs on the social background, but still I got more the sense that a lot of this teenagers where hapless kids that were overwhelmed by what happened. Got shocked how easy it was in the 1970ies to go to the center of Berlin as a John and buy teenage junkies for sex.

With you on ""Yasuke"". Generally I am not fond of the trend started by Castlevania to make this super short anime series. I wished ""Yasuke"" had some filler episodes. Too crammed with everything they could pull out of their minds."
Iron Ladies,"Following the list:

Invincible is absolutely a 8 from me too.

On Wonder Egg right now, looks atleast a 8 so far is in itself its gonna be worth it

Iron Ladies,[deleted]
Iron Ladies,Save
Iron Ladies,Does anyone know any shows that is like Dark?
Iron Ladies,I recommend Scenes from a Marriage on HBO. Its very well acted and well written.
Iron Ladies,Of those i have seen probably invincible.
Iron Ladies,"Oh that's because the 'rating' I give when I *review* a series, isn't just '*how I feel about the series from 1-10*'. Well... it is and it isn't. Originality, creativity and innovation are still the basis of my ratings and the determining factors as to whether or not I like something... but I still rate all the essential elements, then use the average as the final score.

Hopefully this makes more sense.

    > Firefly Lane:
    Originality/Creativity : 6 
    writing (plot & cha): 7 
    writing (dia): 6 
    acting: 8 
    visuals/cine: 7 
    prod.: 7 
    rating: 6.8

I don't post it like this because it makes more sense in my head then when shared lol. Rating the visuals, acting, writing etc. individually then using the average as the final score allows me to work out how good i thought something was overall without thinking about it directly you know.... I also remove 1.0 point whenever I don't finish something. It might sound weird... but Im just glad someone cared enough to ask. lol."
Iron Ladies,That's because you haven't seen Wonder Egg Priority yet. 😉
Iron Ladies,Kate Winslet was just phenomenal in that. Some of the finest acting that I have ever seen. The rest of the supporting cast were all really good also.
Iron Ladies,Is it too America centric?
Iron Ladies,"For all Mankind is a hidden gem, if it were on any other network it would be massively popular. Fantastic show."
Iron Ladies,many words written
Iron Ladies,Yea... that's what I'm doing here.
Iron Ladies,"mmmm,,,,, this actually looks interesting. Doubt I'll have time for it though. And yea it's a 2021 release."
Iron Ladies,"Mare of Easttown at a 7/10? Id give it a 9.5, its one of the best crime mystery shows in awhile, and Kate Winslet alone makes it worth watching"
Iron Ladies,"I agree 100% with MoE when I was watching it i felt like I watched this thing 100 times before, not a bad show but I will say it’s one of the most overrated shows of 2021"
Iron Ladies,"WandaVision was more than okay, but IRYO."
Iron Ladies,"> Not with you on that

On what exactly, that I called it stylistic, that I listed it under ""outstanding"" or both? 

Probably a case of separating book from adaptation as you said. I haven't read the book myself but according to several reactions I've seen from people who like both (and the disclaimer at the start of each episode emphasizing that it's merely ""inspired by"" these events), you're suppose to take the series as its own thing. There are new characters, their relations are different and none of their backstories (besides Christiane's) are the same as in the book/film apparently. 

Taking the series for what it is I thought it was pretty great. The concept of modernizing the 1970s with a surrealistic approach is fantastic and something we haven't seen before. And out course it's still one of the most daring things on the TV platform to the point where it isn't even available for U.S. viewers on Prime (or at least it wasn't). Plus it still packs an emotional punch showing the consequences of drug use.... I fucks with it. lol."
Iron Ladies,"what does ""as a John"" mean in this context, american?"
Iron Ladies,"> On Wonder Egg right now

Skip the OVA special. 😖"
Iron Ladies,What? 😐
Iron Ladies,"* The Rain
* The Innocents
* Tribes of Europa"
Iron Ladies,The OA
Iron Ladies,Ehh idk if I'll have time for it to be honest. I feel like the original is enough.
Iron Ladies,"Indeed, (6 + 7 + 6 + 8 + 7 + 7) / 6 ≈ 6.8, but why don't you weigh ""Originality/Creativity"" more than the other categories? After all:

>Shows categorized based on originality, creativity and innovation (as those are the 3 main factors I look for in TV shows)

And what exactly is ""prod.""? Direction? Editing?

Also: no category for scoring/music... Have you no decency? Or actual hearing loss?

>I also remove 1.0 point whenever I don't finish something

Why not just subtract 1 point per unwatched episode - this way you can get into negative numbers when something is *really* awful, especially when rating 20+ episode network nonsense..."
Iron Ladies,"What a shitty way to say, “You might also like *Wonder Egg Priority*”"
Iron Ladies,Agreed.  She was great.
Iron Ladies,so many words... so many fuckin' words lol.
Iron Ladies,"Yeah, it is 20 1-hour long episodes. But I actually looked forward each week to the new episodes, and it’s rare for a show to have that effect on me."
Iron Ladies,"    > Mare of Easttown:
    originality/creativity: 3/10 
    writing (plot & cha): 8/10 
    writing (dialogue): 7/10 
    acting: 10/10 
    visuals/cinema: 7/10 
    production: 7/10 
    rating: 7.0 out of 10

So, for all the reasons I've already said there's no way I would give Mare of Easttown a 9.5. I do agree that it is probably the best detective-mystery of the year so far though, but that might say more about how creatively starved that sub-genre has been since the days of True Detective and The Missing. Or I don't know maybe my favorite detective shows were the ones in a long line-up of typical offerings that pushed the envelop a bit.

But as I mentioned Mare of Easttown is a well put together show, but its goals steer towards precision without much thought of offering something new, and if you read my 'NB' in the opening statement or you're familiar with my posts, you'll know I have an issue with that. hehe."
Iron Ladies,"Personally, I was surprised how good it was - and fell also in the trap to almost dismiss after the first episode. Really creative take."
Iron Ladies,">The concept of modernizing the 1970s with a surrealistic approach is fantastic and something we haven't seen before.

Legion...?"
Iron Ladies,Its bad?
Iron Ladies,"Have you watched Magicka Madoka btw?

Wonder Eggs setting and premise is basically taken from there"
Iron Ladies,What about The White Lotus? Also from HBO
Iron Ladies,"> why don't you weigh ""Originality/Creativity"" more than the other categories?

mmm.... nah. It just works better (in my head) if it's equally it own essential. A show can have an original idea, but bad writing, or vice-versa... but i still would want to give points for the idea itself, on equal grounds with everything else such as writing, acting and visuals. 

> And what exactly is ""prod.""?

Production is all the other stuff that can be taken into consideration like sets, costumes (mostly for period dramas), designs (especially for animated stuff), music/ost, editing, make-up sometimes etc. Occasionally one of the things I listed will stick out, like the soundtrack on Yasuke, or the editing on Sexify... I just use ""production"" to give nod points to those. Shows with bigger budget will get higer points for production of course but low buget shows that still manages to be effective and convincing with limited budget also gets high points for production. 

> Why not just subtract 1 point per unwatched episode - this way you can get into negative numbers when something is really awful, especially when rating 20+ episode network nonsense...

Ok this.... this makes a lot of sense. lol. I doubt i'll ever get a negative score on anything though lol. I mostly watch shows with 8-10 episodes... shit sometimes 6. Plus I watch 4 episodes of every single show before I decide whether or not I want to quit."
Iron Ladies,"> “You might also like *Wonder Egg Priority*”

I wasn't trying to say this at all. Wonder Egg Priority has nothing in common with Mare of Easttown, it's just *better* (even with that underproduced OVA for an ending). 🤷"
Iron Ladies,"Agreed. The 1st two episodes were kinda boring, but it got so much better."
Iron Ladies,Legion's setting is a modernization of the 1970s?? I always took it like it just didn't want viewers to know what year it was set in lol.
Iron Ladies,Terrible. They had major production issues. Not sure why they even released it.
Iron Ladies,Great! I made this post before I watched that.
Iron Ladies,">mmm.... nah.

You misunderstand - I wasn't making a suggestion, I was asking a question: why do you emphasise ""originality, creativity"" as ""main factors"" you look for in TV shows when, in the end, you weigh those on an equal level to writing, acting, etc.?"
Iron Ladies,Thanks for the spoiler
Iron Ladies,The first two episodes aren't the problem with it.  It's really the last 2.
Iron Ladies,"Oh because it's the basis of my write-ups really. Let me put it like this... It gets its own category, but really what aspects of a show are original, creative or innovative? It could be any of the other essentials I rate. It could be the writing, dialogue, visuals, production etc. I didn't have to rate originality/creativity by itself... most people don't even think about that when watching shows."
Iron Ladies,What!? 😐
Iron Ladies,"I meant it more that it went to a total different way than I expected, and I liked that."
Iron Ladies,People only hated the last episode because their fan theories didn't come true.
Iron Ladies,"True enough, I'd regard something like ""originality"" solely as a modifier to more traditional categories - something doesn't necessarily need to be original, to be ""good"" (whatever that word may mean).

Thank you for sharing your thought process."
Iron Ladies,And because it completely wiped out any consequences for Scarlet Witch and acted like she was the victim of the whole thing *she orchestrated*. Scarlet Witch was *the only actual villain* in the entire series
Iron Ladies,"> I'd regard something like ""originality"" solely as a modifier to more traditional categories - something doesn't necessarily need to be original, to be ""good""

Exactly! But for me, a person who watches A LOT of television, there has to be original ideas or creative execution or done in a way I haven't seen before for me to really like something or find it praise-worthy. 

That's why I put that in the opening statement, because originality, creativity and innovation is what I look for when I personally watch anything... but the writing, acting, visuals etc. still has to be up to standard. hehe."
Iron Ladies,"I'd think one of Game of Thrones episodes should be on the list, though I can't seem to choose between Two Swords, The Lion and the Rose, The Laws of Gods and Men, Mockingbird, The Mountain and the Viper, Watchers on the Wall, and The Children.

Iron Ladies,"Masters of Sex - Fight should be top 3, probably #1"
Iron Ladies,[deleted]
Iron Ladies,"Whoa whoa whoa. This is a great list but picking ""The Truth About Unicorns"" as the best episode of Banshee S2 is unusual. Pretty much everything about that episode was a dip from the quality of the show as the whole. The dialogue was clunky and the directing was kind of weird, and not as much happened as could have happened.

I'm still catching up and I just caught this episode last night, so I've still got about 5 more episodes to go until Friday's premiere, but I'm surprised to see it on any ""best of"" list. To each his own, I guess."
Iron Ladies,I would've put the Dumb Starbucks episode of Nathan For You on over the souvenir shop.
Iron Ladies,Absolutely agree that there is no contest for the number 1 choice. Best episode I have seen in quite some time.
Iron Ladies,I would add the Massachusetts/heroin episode of Tony Bourdain Parts Unknown. Best single episode of TV I have seen all year.
Iron Ladies,Doctor Who-Listen deserves to be there.
Iron Ladies,How are there no Goldbergs on this list. Best and only show on ABC
Iron Ladies,"Of the TV shows I've seen in your list (Hannibal, Louie, Leftovers, True Detective, New Girl, Community, Fargo, Justified) I agree with those episodes and pretty much the order too.  

Surprised you couldn't fit in the 'Optimal Tip-to-Tip Efficiency' episode from Silicon Valley as you mentioned because that was the top comedy episode of the year for me."
Iron Ladies,[deleted]
Iron Ladies,"I'm not the biggest GOT fan around, but yeah, there were some great episodes this season: The Lion and the Rose, Mountain and the Viper, and Watchers on the Wall were my top three. I ended up not being able to fit any in, but I can see why you would have some in your top 20. "
Iron Ladies,"Yup, ""A Day's Work"" was my second favorite episode of the season.

""Happy Valentine's Day. I love you."""
Iron Ladies,Rixty Minutes definitely makes my list. 
Iron Ladies,"I think Dramatics, Your Honor was a great episode with a masterfully directed and acted final sequence, but as pieces of television as a whole, the other three I mentioned were just above it for me. 

And you definitely should watch Hannibal. Highly recommended."
Iron Ladies,The end of the episode FU
Iron Ladies,"That's fair. Caplan and Sheen were really amazing in that one, and it's yet another episode I feel bad about leaving out of the top 20. I wasn't quite as taken with it as some others--I actually liked a few other episodes that season a bit more--but it was definitely an impressive piece of TV."
Iron Ladies,"Thanks! Nice to see you around again. I agree about this season of Justified being the weakest, but I did want to give a spot to ""Shot All to Hell"" because it was really awesome. I'm really hoping that the show will go out with a bang, because I definitely want to see that high up on next year's year end lists.

I do need to get to Rick and Morty at some time. I've heard Rixty Minutes is also fantastic."
Iron Ladies,"That definitely was a divisive episode, but I appreciated the risk the show took there; yeah, it was flawed for sure, but I thought it worked. Excellent acting and cinematography, and not something you'd expect from the show (whether that's positive or negative is up to the person, I guess).

Plus, it had this shot, which was amazing:

"
Iron Ladies,"And also, look out for episodes 8 and 9. Those were standout episodes for me as well. 

Looking forward to season 3! This really is an awesome show. With this, The Knick, and Strike Back, Cinemax is really stepping up its game."
Iron Ladies,Just for that first staff meeting alone.
Iron Ladies,"I felt bad about not getting that one in the top 20. If I were to make a Top Scenes list, though, that dick joke scene would be way up there."
Iron Ladies,It's kind of crazy to think (not sure why) but it actually ended in September 2013. It does seem more recent to me too.
Iron Ladies,"I also think GoT should have been on the list, but I was VERY pleasantly surprised to see the (well-deserved) love for Shameless. Easily the most underrated show on the air."
Iron Ladies,*The warmth of your love is like the warmth from the sun*
Iron Ladies,"I really like your list. My episode of the year, though, was The Good Wife's ""The Trial"", followed by ""Mizumono"" and ""The Strategy"", then just some shifting around from what you listed. Props for giving Person of Interest some love, that series needs more of it."
Iron Ladies,"For non-viewers, what is happening in that picture?"
Iron Ladies,And right behind that is Masters of Sex. I am Showtime fan. Shameless season 4 was probably one of the best seasons of dramady that I have ever seen.
Iron Ladies,"That's the most recent episode, right? I've heard good things about that; I'm still a bit behind on season 6. 

Person of Interest is great. The next two episodes look to be two of the best they've done."
Iron Ladies,I applaud anyone who reads all of this post
Iron Ladies,Holy lack of punctuation... I almost had a seizure attempting to read this. Couldn’t even get half way.
Iron Ladies,"Starting to write..trying to improve mate..
Bear with me 🙌🏻"
Iron Ladies,">For GoT, this season's writing has simply been atrocious

i watched too many shows to know what atrocious writing, this season is far from atrocious "
Déjà Vu,That finale was hilariously incomprehensible.
Déjà Vu,"It’s a shame because Flux was somewhat promising for 2 or 3 episodes but sadly fell apart by the end.

I hope this special will be good but christ, give the Daleks a rest on these New Years’ specials."
Déjà Vu,Lame. Daleks been done to death.
Déjà Vu,"Stopped watching before Capaldi's final season. I don't know if I'm in the minority,  but I always hated Dalek episodes."
Déjà Vu,Yeah... Doctor Who is dead
Déjà Vu,"I've been out on the Chibnall season. Is this his and Whittaker's final episode, or is there more before Davies comes back?"
Déjà Vu,Is the doctor actress still stepping down after this season?  Have they announced a replacement?  I'm really behind on my doctor who news.
Déjà Vu,"Modern Doctor Who: ""You got any more of them Daleks?"""
Déjà Vu,What's a Daleks? I've never heard of this before.
Déjà Vu,After the last few years it really has become Dr..... Who?
Déjà Vu,"Doctor Who sure is getting boring, they seem to recycle the same villains over and over again.  I could go 10 seasons without another Dalek, Cyberman or Weeping Angel episode."
Déjà Vu,I like how they're new years specials because apparently having the specials on December 25th somehow hurts non-christians who can still watch TV on Christmas.
Déjà Vu,"And continuing the trend of Chris Chibnall apparently not understanding... basic morals I guess? Like I'm pretty sure that the Doctor's original plan was to allow two genocides to happen (IE the Sontarans killing the Daleks and Cybermen), having already failed to prevent another one and barely noticed (the dog people), while also directly causing a fourth to happen (the Sontarans) *and* not even bothering to save the universe (because she pulled that solution out of thin air at the last second, it wasn't part of the plan.)

Also I think most of the universe is dead anyway? Unless they fixed it? It was hard to tell tbh.

But anyway, quadruple genocide at the very least. Yay?"
Déjà Vu,"Not really. You'd have to be pretty dense to not understand what was going on.

Dissappointing though. Plenty of stuff left unresolved or just ignored. Hard to see how this special won't be a continuation of flux, or at least the fallout."
Déjà Vu,"Yeah I've honestly had it with the daleks, not interesting or fun, just bloody annoying and boring, constant whinging about extermination"
Déjà Vu,"I'd argue that every Dalek episode in the ""modern"" Dr. Who era have been good.  It doesn't mean I would think any Dalek story with Chibnall and Whittaker would be any good.  Daleks have been done to death, even if the modern ones have been at minimum okay."
Déjà Vu,This is also I think the third Dalek New Years' Special in a row. :/
Déjà Vu,"Agreed. I mean I know at the beginning it was part of the agreement for them to get to keep using the Daleks that they had to appear every year.

But as its seemingly been renegotiated since then, I wish they wouldn't appear so often.

The worst part is it seems they always go through the same pattern. One or few Daleks that is extremely dangerous, followed by massive armies that strangely accomplish nothing, then a defeat usually through a sudden last minute idea that wipes them all out and seemingly resets all the damage."
Déjà Vu,"Literally

As I understand it all Daleks were killed in the last episode"
Déjà Vu,The Dalek opener in Series 9 was the last good Dalek episode. The Davros and Doctor scenes were perfect
Déjà Vu,Watch series 10 it's actually quite enjoyable. Though the shows peak for me was series 9 which was  just an acting powerhouse by Capaldi.
Déjà Vu,Hopefully RTD is able to bring it back to life again
Déjà Vu,There are still three specials spread over 2022. So it will be 2023 before we see anything from RTD.
Déjà Vu,"She's leaving and has only 3 episodes left, and will be gone by the end of 2022. No replacement has been announced yet"
Déjà Vu,She’s doing a few specials and leaving late next year.
Déjà Vu,"Classic Doctor Who: ""First time?"""
Déjà Vu,We went 9 years without a proper Weeping Angel episode.
Déjà Vu,"Umm... they're still airing Christmas Specials, just not Doctor Who ones. It's nothing to do with offending non-Christians."
Déjà Vu,"But she hates guns (or as she says, boot she hates goons.)"
Déjà Vu,"> Plenty of stuff left unresolved or just ignored.

That's the incomprehensible part.

Between the pacing and editing and dropped threads, it's incomprehensible. Yeah, you can just about follow ""Purple bad guy kills bad guys. Magic random door is used to strand other bad guy away far away for now.""

Is the universe still destroyed?"
Déjà Vu,To be honest you have to have a high iq to understand doctor who....
Déjà Vu,"Yeah they really need to make the Daleks scary again IMO. Like winning against a Dalek should be just barely getting away alive. If the Doctor single-handedly wipes out millions of them every time they meet, then who cares?"
Déjà Vu,I feel like this could be in-world dialogue lol
Déjà Vu,Victory of the Daleks and Daleks in Manhattan are awful.
Déjà Vu,"> I'd argue that every Dalek episode in the ""modern"" Dr. Who era have been good.

I'd argue the opposite. Boring boring boring boring boring.  I won't even watch the NYE special because it's the bloody dumb daleks again"
Déjà Vu,"“I hope you are grateful. It wasn't easy to procure. And very nearly unique, of course. You should feel privileged. The only other chair on Skaro.”"
Déjà Vu,Chinballs wrecked it pretty good. I don't think RTD can fix it if he's not willing to undo a lot of the stupid stuff Chinballs put in the show
Déjà Vu,"Hey they at least were willing to take breaks in between. Sometimes as long as five years in between.

Now you can't got a single season without them appearing in some form (that was literally one of the conditions to get to keep using them back when the show came back in 2005, though I think the deals been renegotiated since then).

It makes it more and more difficult to keep coming up with stories and to keep them scary."
Déjà Vu,nah it is not Primer
Déjà Vu,Evolution of the daleks is top 3 worst episodes in the RTD era
Déjà Vu,There is decades of lore and they retcon shit all the time. And frankly Doctor Who is at it's best when it's telling episodic stories that have nothing to do with the grand scheme of the show. The problem with Chibnall's run is that the individual stories have been boring and the season arcs have been nonsensical.
Déjà Vu,"I’d argue the TV movie was probably just about as bad, and they swept a ton of that stuff under the rug after the initial revival"
Déjà Vu,"He'll just ignore it like the show ignored the half human stuff from the movie and how the show has ignored that ""ran away from Gallifrey because he was scared of the Dalek-Human hybrid prophecy"" from Peter Capaldi"
Déjà Vu,"It should be interesting because he did very well last time at taking this continuity-ridden universe and creating a brand new start that was really welcoming to new viewers. Obviously that was after the long long gap, but he may well try and pull off a similar trick, moving on by not really acknowledging the immediate past."
Déjà Vu,The only way to fix it at this point imo would be to do a full reboot again which has actually been rumored.
Déjà Vu,It's a time travel show. Continuity doesn't matter.
Déjà Vu,"> There is decades of lore and they retcon shit all the time.

There are a lot of things you can retcon and get away with it. While some you don't touch because you will screw things up. It's like how you shouldn't mess with a load bearing wall."
Déjà Vu,"Doctor who doesn't rely on continuity per say, but much like when the doctor talks about ""fixed points in time"" certain things it really do stick in canon, and I think people forget that. This is now one of those things as it's a fully fleshed out origin for the character (instead of a single ""half human"" offhand comment), and the nature of this origin just ruins the doctors motivations from the hartnall era to now and beyond.

Chibnall wrote a nonsensical plot that basically destroyed the show, past, present and future, unless it's somehow reconned out (which the ""flux"" season had so many opportunities to do, but instead had 18 plot points that went nowhere and weren't really resolved or solved)"
Déjà Vu,"Yeah but in that case the reveal was limited to a one off line that could be cut with nothing else really changing.

Not entire episodes dedicated to it.

I still think their going to have to sweep it under the rug, but its going to need a much bigger rug.

At this point were talking a scene of the Doctor waking up and going ""what a crazy dream, I've got to stop eating cheese before I got to bed."""
Déjà Vu,"It's worth pointing out that Moffat deliberately left wiggle room on the Hybrid prophecy. It's suggested that the Doctor may have known nothing about the prophecy at all, and merely used it as leverage to get into a position to bring Clara back.

In *Heaven Sent*, the big reveal at the end is, ""The Hybrid destined to conquer Gallifrey and stand in its ruins is me.""

But in *Hell Bent*, the Doctor says this to Ashildr, ""That's your best theory? I'm the Hybrid? I ran away from Gallifrey because I was afraid of myself? That doesn't make any sense.""

Davies featured a woman from the Doctor's past in *The End of Time*, but didn't specify who it was. Both Davies and Moffat knew that you can tell stories that dig into the Doctor's past, but you need to provide wiggle room so that future writers can do whatever they want too. Chibnall... doesn't give a shit. It's a big part of the reason the Timeless Child stuff sucks."
Déjà Vu,Full reboot again?  When did that happen?
Déjà Vu,Yeah the Doctors numbering sequence was one of those things you don’t mess with.
Déjà Vu,And I'm pretty sure nothing that Chibnall has done is unignorable. RTD2 will be just fine.
Déjà Vu,"It isn't just a one off line, it's mentioned multiple times throughout the movie."
Déjà Vu,"He left wiggle on what exactly the prophecy was referring to, but in Heaven Sent, the Doctor has to tell the truth to stop the monster from attacking him and he says he left Gallifrey because he was scared"
Déjà Vu,I am only passingly familiar with Doctor Who but didn't Chinballs leave wiggle room on the Timeless Child stuff by having it be stated by The Master? So The Master could easily just be lying about who the Timeless Child actually is.
Déjà Vu,The show never had full reboot
Déjà Vu,"I mean, not only did he not do that, Moffat literally did that first because he wanted to be the one to do the ""the Doctor gets new lives"" plot and brought in John Hurt."
Déjà Vu,The doctor not from gallifry anymore and the time lords just copying everything????  WTF retard wrote that deserves a daily spanking
Déjà Vu,"My apologies, its been years since I saw that film I must be remembering it wrong."
Déjà Vu,"That's true, but that's still extremely vague. Scared for Susan? Scared of what he'd become if he stayed in the Capitol of Gallifrey? Scared because of something he'd done?

I don't feel that limits future writers or stories in any way. It just gives you the tiniest insight into the First Doctor's feelings at the time he stole the TARDIS."
Déjà Vu,[deleted]
Déjà Vu,It was but then he confirmed it to be absolutely true by having the previous season revolve around it sort of.
Déjà Vu,"But, the way he did was very elegant and what he did actually made sense."
Déjà Vu,I could be and might be wrong here but didn’t John Hurts war doc sort of resist out of time? Like he was isolated unable to regenerate or refused to maybe?
Déjà Vu,"The Time Lords found someone who regenerates infinitely, copied that into their own template and then wiped the Doctor's memories to be as if they were raised on Gallifrey. Ultimately the back back story changes but everything else remains the same, and honestly the continuity in that Universe is rewritten constantly, god forbid you see what the wilderness years did to it or even current novels and audios. It's really easy to ignore and start where convenient, every writer ever does it."
Déjà Vu,"Would have certainly. But honestly I'm not sure what even adding the Timeless Child really added to the series beyond another example of bashing us over the head with ""the Time Lords were all jerks and weren't as great as they claimed to be."""
Déjà Vu,"The whole ""Yeah the Doctors numbering sequence was one of those things you don’t mess with."" is exactly what people were saying when Steven Moffat added the War Doctor."
Déjà Vu,"Nope. Until 2013, we assume that 8 fought in the time war and regenerated into 9, but instead then we learn that in fact, Eight regenerated on a planet mid-time war and wasn't really fighting, and then he regenerated into John Hurt, then he fought, then he regenerated, and then they just said they wanted to forget about him because of all the war crimes or whatever he did, but he is what's in between McGann and Eccleston canonically. The show retcons and hand waves so often, this isn't a Chibnall thing. Hell, it's arguably better that Chibs put the Timeless Children before 1 because 1 is where the numbering starts  for ""our Doctors"", if you want to include John Hurt you have to clumsily call him The War Doctor."
Déjà Vu,The War Doctor is my favorite Doctor. Granted I’m a casual fan who loved Eccleston and bounces in and out since. I’m interested in your perspective as not many people I know like Chibnalls timeless children concept.
Déjà Vu,"You know what, I don't think I've ever heard someone say the War was their favourite (not that he's bad, just that he was a niche one off one).

I think the issue people have (for the most part) is the writing. I'll defend Chibs stories but yeah, he's clunky. But the idea of The Timeless Child wouldn't be shit on if RTD wrote it - and if Moffat wrote it, people would come around to the idea eventually. I don't think there's anything wrong with the Doctor having had lives before his first because it's been implied in EU and classic material which was praised (and had the show continued in the 80s, it's likely we would have had a plot that was somewhat similar to TTC, as TTC is vaguely inspired by those ideas). I do think the general consensus is a more ""meh idea, bad execution"" and you only have a small number of people who think Chibnall is shitting all over canon (he isn't) and that it brings in a whole bunch of plot holes (it doesn't - one is that The Timeless Child had infinite regenerations, supposedly. The Time Lords used the power of regeneration, but limited it on themselves to only 13. But to some people they refuse to think the Doctor had their regenerations also limited (which makes sense in text, see The Time of the Doctor where Matt Smith literally was given more regenerations and nothing contradicts that)). 

Essentially, I view The Timeless Doctors/Child as a different entity to The Doctor. They share the name of Doctor, which is more shorthand to the audience more than anything, but once (presumably) The Division were done with The Fugitive Doctor, they wiped her mind, reset their regenerations, gave them 13, and put them on Gallifrey to live their life from being a child. It's more reincarnation than anything - imagine if reincarnation (in the religious sense) existed, and you're going about your day but then tomorrow you learn you are a serial killer reincarnated. You remember nothing, you are nothing like him in any way, shape, or form, but you now have all these horrific crimes and feel somewhat responsible. This body that was yours exists because it once belonged to a horrible person centuries ago. That's kind of what The Timeless Child is, in my eyes at least.

And no I'm not looking for a debate with other people!! Hate it or like it I don't mind, I was just asked a question and I've put the basic idea and how I view it down. I hope it answered your question, u/pm_me_ur_chonchon"
Déjà Vu,You did good hombre. You did good.
Déjà Vu,This is the same show that showed Peter fight a man in a chicken suit for over five minutes. Good writing has never been their strong suit.
Déjà Vu,"OMFG I HAD THE EXACT SAME REACTION!

Now I can't tell if it was a preview I saw or literally a copy/paste from another episode...

Losing it over here."
Déjà Vu,"That protracted scene was so over-the-top ridiculous it was a hoot.  

The show features some other gold moments, but, yeah, good writing isn't its strong suit."
Déjà Vu,These are the best scenes though.  
Déjà Vu,"First chicken fight was gold and one of the best moments of ""classic"" Family Guy. The second chicken fight was still good because it came after the show's revival and was still a surprise while not acting as TOO much fan service. The third one got spoiled for me by FOX because it was in the preview leading up to the episode, which was dumb and probably the point where I gave up on the show. Was there ever a fourth one? "
Déjà Vu,"[And now ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Conway Twitty.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Og1QRtcWdEY)"
Déjà Vu,I actually think them scenes are hilarious
Déjà Vu,I think so. Also the fight with Homer in the crossover is similarly ridiculous (and lasts nearly ten minutes).
