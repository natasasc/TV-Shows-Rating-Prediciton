Once Upon a Time... Life,"At first I thought OUAT was a terrible concept. Then I started watching and realized, oh, this is a great concept (and mostly great acting)! Then kept going and went, oh, they’re doing this very poorly."
Once Upon a Time... Life,"Fuck that.

It's called FABLES. The show Once tried to be but gave up. 

And the game A Wolf Among Us

That's what I want"
Once Upon a Time... Life,"Fuck that, Galavant season 3...let's fucking go!"
Once Upon a Time... Life,"They tried something similar from the same people who made Once Upon A Time but didn't greenlight it after making the pilot. 

>Epic, the Disney-themed fairy tale anthology, is not moving forward at ABC.

>The Disney-owned broadcast network has opted to not pick up the drama pilot to series. Ordered to pilot in January under new network topper Craig Erwich, Epic would have marked a homecoming to ABC for Once Upon a Time creators Adam Horowitz and Edward Kitsis. The duo exec produced Epic alongside writer Brigitte Hales, who previously worked with Horowitz and Kitsis on Once Upon a Time and their short-lived Apple anthology Amazing Stories.

>Sources say the pilot didn’t come in strong despite execs being excited about the script. The pilot was filmed in Ireland, and, because of the pandemic, Kitsis and Horowitz were unable to go on location for the shoot.

Once Upon a Time... Life,Once Upon a Time was awesome. It was so batshit insane that your cant even deacribe story arcs without sounds like you arent on large amounts of drugs
Once Upon a Time... Life,[deleted]
Once Upon a Time... Life,Disney+ should bring House of Mouse first
Once Upon a Time... Life,I’d rather they do another galavant type Show
Once Upon a Time... Life,Basically the comic Fable?
Once Upon a Time... Life,"I think you're onto something. The actors who depicted those characters in OUaT are not the same people who depicted them in previous adaptations of those stories:

In the 'real world' of OUaT, the story of Cinderella existed which means that the movie where Julie Andrews played the character can exist. But the in their world there is no actress named Dania Ramirez, instead that body/face belongs exclusively to their real world Cinderella.

Now take the same logic and apply to a new Disney property like Star Wars. In our world, the story of SW exists. But if a SW version of OUaT was made, it would play out a scenario in which the 'real' SW characters traveled through a worm-hole the show's version of Earth. In that show, a new actor could depict Luke."
Once Upon a Time... Life,"I like the idea of combining the OUAT concept with the Brothers Grimm movie concept that Matt Damon and Heath Ledger starred in. 

Don’t just like “make it dark,” but put a spin on it that makes it more interesting than just “what if fairytale characters existed in a small town.”"
Once Upon a Time... Life,"They would never do it, but they should adapt the Fables comic. Shit would be amazing. Like Twin Peaks meets X Files meets Shrek. 

It’s Once Upon a Time. But… actually good (I’m sorry it was so hammy)"
Once Upon a Time... Life,"I feel this way about Greek mythology. Can we get like a game of thrones, high quality show about the Greek gods?"
Once Upon a Time... Life,"I love remakes of fairy tales and was prepared to adore Once, but it was awful. The first entire season was the main character literally not believing the basic premise of the show. And then it was just shoe-horning in a ton of properties to try and ""say the thing"" and get people to watch."
Once Upon a Time... Life,or hbo should just make fables instead of this horrible disney abc garbage rip off
Once Upon a Time... Life,Disney is too conservative to do fantasy right.
Once Upon a Time... Life,"The concept of Disney properties having a crossover with each other?

That sounds a lot like Kingdom Hearts lol, but with a dash of anime

Oh yeah, what happened to that Kingdom Hearts Disney+ show that was announced a few years ago?"
Once Upon a Time... Life,What you want is Live Action Kingdom Hearts which is basically Disney’s Game of Thrones.
Once Upon a Time... Life,ABC-fied or woke garbage?
Once Upon a Time... Life,"In the “lost pilots” thread that was posted here a few days ago, there was a similar concept set in monster lore (Frankenstein/Dracula/werewolf/etc)."
Once Upon a Time... Life,Watch the 10th Kingdom. It's a miniseries so only a few episodes.
Once Upon a Time... Life,[deleted]
Once Upon a Time... Life,"As much as I'd love that, there's no way in hell Disney would adapt Fables literally. I mean, OUaT was a bit dark at times but Fables has GoT-level messed up stuff. And even though all characters have long been in the public domain I don't think any other network or platform would dare to try lest they anger the Mouse. I could see it in AppleTV+, though; CGI-heavy shows with grounded but twisted stories are right up their alley."
Once Upon a Time... Life,"The fucked up thing is that ABC picked up Fables for an adaptation, then dropped it, and then almost immediately launched Once Upon A Time. Given the nature of the property, you can't really say they're violating the IP since it's all based off the public domain, but OUAT is very obviously a Fables rip-off"
Once Upon a Time... Life,"YES YES YES YES YES.

And give it an actual ending, instead of the build up at the end of the comics leading to pretty much a thank you from the creators. Which was nice, but damn.

Hmmm, actually Fables deals with a lot of hardcore stuff. So send it to Hulu I guess."
Once Upon a Time... Life,THIS PERSON FUCKING GETS IT
Once Upon a Time... Life,Amen. Fables was an amazing journey.
Once Upon a Time... Life,[deleted]
Once Upon a Time... Life,Tad Cooper needs his day in the sun.
Once Upon a Time... Life,What do y'all think of the writers absolute refusal to let Mr. Gold be redeemed? It was ultimately why I stopped watching after Mr. Gold fought so hard to be a good person and threw it all away yet again for like the 4th time. Sort of just felt repetitive.
Once Upon a Time... Life,"I know! When I was watching all those years ago I would tweet just bits of info, my mind was being blown and I had to share it with the world lol.  Then I tweeted the spoiler about Red and finally my brother (one of my 3 followers lol) was like “I know this is about that show you watch, nothing you tweet makes sense, I guess I have to watch it now” He was hooked (😉) from day one!"
Once Upon a Time... Life,"Yes.

But is difficult. If Disney wants to create a megahit they need Kingdom Hearts to be live action, and that would imply lots of money.

Also Kingdom Hearts' story is very difficult to understand because it became really complicated, especially since KH2, it would require a massive rework.

Then it's finding children and all the problems associated with it.

First, let's see how Percy Jackson and the Olympians performs..."
Once Upon a Time... Life,"> but is the Kingdom Hearts series still in development?

Yes, KH4 got a trailer drop months ago but it doesn't look like it'll be involved with the Disney stuff, at least from the initial trailer."
Once Upon a Time... Life,THE MOST AMBITIOUS CROSSOVER OF ALL TIME
Once Upon a Time... Life,Man Zeus would make it awkward real quick. But it would/could be incredibly fun. Double fun cause my dogs name is Zeus and gets confused when he hears it on tv.
Once Upon a Time... Life,For it to be a tax write off?
Once Upon a Time... Life,Agreed. They carried that show.
Once Upon a Time... Life,Fables is also owned by DC. So yeah Disney can't adapt it.
Once Upon a Time... Life,"If I told you Disney would make a mini series of Pam and Tommy’s sex tape, and Chippendales rise and fall, would you say the same thing?"
Once Upon a Time... Life,"I agree with everything you said.

I still won't budge. Too good not to make and if they can simply read a comic then it would be amazing. If someone can adapt fucking Sandman to tv then a true Fables is possible.

Fables or bust not another half ass like Once. I want the whole ass!"
Once Upon a Time... Life,"> And even though all characters have long been in the public domain I don't think any other network or platform would dare to try lest they anger the Mouse.

If Mattel was willing to burn Disney with a rival to Disney Princesses despite being the company making Disney dolls I don't think any company fears Disney in regards to new expressions of public domain characters.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ever_After_High"
Once Upon a Time... Life,"Yup, gave up.  

Instead of making something potentially revolutionary they went literal ABC and made a completely forgettable show.

It's not too late. Fables remains such a high quality that if you just do what Sandman did then you'd have a great show. Learn from the  Y Last Man and Runaways mistakes."
Once Upon a Time... Life,Not sure if you know but Fables came back in 2022 with 12 more issues. Keeps going after 150
Once Upon a Time... Life,Strong jaw and perfect hair!
Once Upon a Time... Life,[deleted]
Once Upon a Time... Life,Thanks. Now that’s running through my head as I’m working haha
Once Upon a Time... Life,"Man Rumple went from one of the most interesting characters to one of the most annoying. They should’ve just let him stay dead after his sacrifice in season 3, that was a perfect end to his character."
Once Upon a Time... Life,Im not buying that it needs to be live action to be a hit
Once Upon a Time... Life,"> If Disney wants to create a megahit they need Kingdom Hearts to be live action

They literally designed Sora to look like a cartoon so that he could more easily hang out with all the other cartoons he was going to meet on his adventure through cartoon worlds, why would you want a live action version of that?"
Once Upon a Time... Life,"
>Also Kingdom Hearts' story is very difficult to understand because it became really complicated, 

I will use any opportunity to post this video.

https://youtu.be/4YVTBQCbezQ

I can't even tell you how many times I've watched it over the years."
Once Upon a Time... Life,"KH story would be easy to simplify, just delete 90% of it.  

Nothing of value was lost."
Once Upon a Time... Life,They literally showed Endor in the trailer lol
Once Upon a Time... Life,Hades shows up at the end of the trailer what are you talking about. Well not shows up but its him talking and throwing the fire to donald and goofy
Once Upon a Time... Life,Disney can't adapt it *for free*
Once Upon a Time... Life,ABC did work on a version of Fables in 2008
Once Upon a Time... Life,"But those are not fairy tales, which are one of the main pillars of their brand. I really don't think they are very keen on turning formerly family-friendly characters into assassins, psychopaths, and brutal dictators. Or maybe they are, who knows, Peter Pan was pretty terrifying in OUaT."
Once Upon a Time... Life,"Oh, I actually didn't. I remember a few years ago that they were planning a mini arc, but I didn't know it was released.

I'll look into that, cheers!"
Once Upon a Time... Life,Cojones out to there
Once Upon a Time... Life,A real ear worm.
Once Upon a Time... Life,No it definitely does. It's not like Disney is famous for its animation or anything like that.
Once Upon a Time... Life,doing it like Who Framed Roger Rabbit would be sick
Once Upon a Time... Life,"I didn't say I wanted that.

I only said that if they want it to be a megahit the easiest way (and, at the same time most difficult way because of the problems it may face) is that. ;)"
Once Upon a Time... Life,"DC, I’ve come to bargain"
Once Upon a Time... Life,">	Peter Pan was pretty terrifying in OUaT.

 And in the disney+ rescue rangers movie"
Once Upon a Time... Life,There was no hero quite like *GALAVAAAAANT!*
Once Upon a Time... Life,"I guess if was more of a rhetorical “why would *anyone* want that?”  It’s supposed to be a cartoon, let it be a cartoon.  Kingdom Hearts 3 had multiple cutscenes so long my Xbox tries to turn itself off.  And there were worlds where it was like “long ass cutscene, fight three headless, long ass cutscene, fight two heartless, long ass cutscene, walk into another room, long ass cutscene.”  They clearly want to make a cartoon, just let them make a cartoon."
Once Upon a Time... Life,"Sup Marvel, we got The Batman and uh..Peacemaker!"
Once Upon a Time... Life,Tough! Plus every other man-ly value!
Once Upon a Time... Life,"Because Sora looks like a human and is a human. This is the dumbest argument, why would you want a Live Action Avengers if they are drawn as comic characters? Makes no sense"
Once Upon a Time... Life,"Mess with him, he'll disembowel you!"
Once Upon a Time... Life,"YEAH! He ruled in every way!

A fairytale *cliche*."
Once Upon a Time... Life,"I'm willing to bet that they would have Abuela making a deal with Rumple for the magic candle, and the magic is dying because of him."
Once Upon a Time... Life,Isabella would own a flower shop like snow queen owned ice cream shop. Antonio would be the town's animal control. Camilo would be actor or town arts director. Julieta a doctor. Feel like all those could be added easily. Dolores a... Detective?... But why wouldn't we meet her before? Maybe there's a new page in Henry's book that prophesies some crazy shit (Bruno) and abuela comes in to calm everyone down while (I like your theory) she's bartering with rumps to get her candle back. Mirabel could be under evil queen's spell and freeing her is the trick to save the town
Once Upon a Time... Life,Abuela turns out to somehow be Regina's long-lost grandmother.
Once Upon a Time... Life,"At the end of one episode, we see the silhouette of a woman standing in a hallway while two characters have a super important conversation. Camera zooms out, it's the girl with the super hearing listening to the whole conversation! What? It ends up the whole family is in Storybrook to help out Rumpelstiltskin. But why? Because Mr.Science, aka Frankenstein is sick of getting beaten on by people with magic, so he recruits some magical people he met on his journeys across the world. Then he starts hooking up with another non-magical person who is surrounded by those with magic, since they can understand each other. An older Mirabella."
Once Upon a Time... Life,It turns out the family in Encanto is related to the main character... and rumple.... and a few other characters.
Once Upon a Time... Life,That show ended how many years ago. And was trash
Once Upon a Time... Life,"Haha I haven't thought about Once Upon a Time in quite a while, but yeah it would be amazing to see them keep adding more and more disney stories.

Imagine if they had started the series now, and could put a proper disney+ budget behind it."
Once Upon a Time... Life,"I have the feeling that it would be better for Netflix long-term if the original content they have has some form of conclusion. Without a conclusion, many people will decide not to even start a show, because they don't want to be left hanging at the end. Shows that got ""finished"" will be stuff that can still draw people to stay on Netflix. Completed shows is something that will stay forever as a viable offering and strengthen them as unique selling points for Netflix.  

I think that is something they need to consider going forward, but I doubt they will do this retroactively for shows that were already cancelled. 

But maybe I am wrong, maybe it will turn out that only very extreme good hit shows actually have any potential (like Friends or Office) to be seen 3+ years after release."
Once Upon a Time... Life,Netflix wanted to have its own catalog of content to stream but its turning into an archive of unfinished series. I come and go as a subscriber but if this trend continues I'm going to be less likely to start new content with them.  I suppose their numbers are driving their decisions but I wonder what their numbers will look like in 5 years when people have more options and have observed a history of their favorite shows ending early.
Once Upon a Time... Life,even though i'm not a biggest fan of this show (i definitely enjoyed season 2 though!) i really hope another outlet picks this show up and continues the story of the OA!
Once Upon a Time... Life,"To be fair, Netflix was truly a beacon for unique programming. The criticism that they have changed their content model is fair, and subscribers can make their decisions on the platforms they chose. 

I dont agree that people have gone ballistic, rather in this circumstance a beloved series is in jeopardy of fading into the nebulous because of unnecessary broadcast/streaming rights. It paints viewers into a corner to fight for the show's renewal on its current platform."
Once Upon a Time... Life,I get tired of finding shows that last 1-2 seasons and then get dropped. Get so old investing that much time.
Once Upon a Time... Life,Season 2 really set the show up to be so much more. Super disappointed to hear it was canceled JUST as it was about to get better
Once Upon a Time... Life,"I know it's been reiterated a hundred times in this sub, but Netflix's failure to issue a legitimate cancellation notice is uniquely odd here. Even after receiving a request from Forbes, Netflix referred to Cindy Holland's statement, which is....lacking finality?

But not joining the tinfoil-hatters. Nope. The OA is gone. For now. Maybe."
Once Upon a Time... Life,"Nobody cared about Santa Clarita Diet, one of the more creative and consistently funny netflix shows."
Once Upon a Time... Life,"I'd cancel Netflix if my wife didn't watch some shows on there.
The platform has been going down hill for a while now.

The OA was one of the most unique shows I've ever seen and I am not surprised at all that Netflix cancelled it. That seems to be their MO these days."
Once Upon a Time... Life,"I like the show but let's be real, the time between season 1 and 2 was unheard of (Part 1 came out in December 2016 and part 2 came out in March 2019) in any format except for shows that have had revivals and it hadn't earned the audience or the money that Stranger Things had to justify another long production before they could push a new season.

While i do think there is a major issue with Netflix cancelling their original programming (which is going to be dangerous for them considering they're going to lose a large portion of their licensed library sooner rather than later) i don't think The OA is the hill to die on when there is justifiable reasons for cancellation."
Once Upon a Time... Life,"Maybe semantics, but didn't Netflix already give the show and its creators ""a chance"" by buying and releasing it?"
Once Upon a Time... Life,Wasn't a huge fan of The OA but it seemed good enough to justify finishing up the story. It was better than a lot of the cringy comedy specials (often by popular actors or whatever who are shitty standup acts).
Once Upon a Time... Life,How is this show?
Once Upon a Time... Life,"I think the main point here is that the creators and writers would have approached the entire series differently if they knew they were only getting 2 seasons. The plan was to tell this story over 5 seasons and there's no way that Netflix was unaware of that when they agreed to make the show.

A fair compromise would have been to tell them during the making of the second season that they would only have three seasons to tell their story. ""Seasons"" of tv shows are shorter than ever and people are gonna stop making ambitious shows if they think they're only gonna get 16-20 episodes."
Once Upon a Time... Life,"Business acts like business, people go ballistic."
Once Upon a Time... Life,The show hasn't really been canceled. We are all now part of the show.
Once Upon a Time... Life,"netflix is trying so hard to the be the next generation bargain bin...

this is what happens when you run your company solely on statistics and forget about the art."
Once Upon a Time... Life,"I'm not a religious person, but I will be praying for the safety of future Altered Carbon seasons..."
Once Upon a Time... Life,Idk if I agree with that sentiment even though I wish OA wasn’t cancelled. Russian Doll for example is fucking whack and beautiful and fantastic and definitely is not in the wheelhouse of a normal cable company
Once Upon a Time... Life,"Or maybe when it turns out people don't like a show that much, it doesn't make sense to continue making it.

Being willing to axe shows that don't work is a critical part of the shotgun method of giving a wide spectrum of ideas a chance. 

If they don't catch on, you have to stop making them, as continuing to produce hundreds of shows so long as anyone at all wants to see them is a surefire way to go out of business. 

They either make a lot of shows and cancel the ones that don't work, or they make fewer shows to begin with and give them a longer chance. Producing a lot of shows and giving them all a long chance doesn't make sense."
Once Upon a Time... Life,"I've never seen The OA but I've felt this trend, not just for Netflix but among most of the streamers. Streaming used to be an upstart industry taking risks and building up the few original shows they had but now it's big business with many originals in the portfolio and they have to make bottom line decisions the way big businesses do. I still want that happy middle ground where they're big enough to put out cool stuff but not so the big they'll cancel it if it isn't an overnight hit. Like Tom Waits... he's been famous for decades but never a megastar. I want the Tom Waits of streaming services."
Once Upon a Time... Life,You either die a hero or live long enough to become Viacom.
Salvation,It was a great summer tv show but it didn’t do well compared to under the dome (the summer show before this one).    I was sad to see it go though it was great light easy to watch summer tv
Salvation,"I'm with you. I was devastated at the cancellation. Yes, there was some cheesiness to it, but overall I actually like the characters and was really interested to see where the show was gonna go. I felt they were really just hitting their stride by the end of the second season."
Salvation,"You're joking, right? It was one of the stupidest SF shows I watched."
Salvation,"Lol why? It was constantly entertaining and never dull. It wasn't perfect but I don't understand how people want a 100% hyper realistic show, then it's so boring"
Salvation,"His *New in Town* stand-up special is amazing. I hadn't laughed so hard in a long time. I was looking forward to his show. I'm sorry things didn't go how he wanted.

EDIT: Just wanted to add, this is a great interview. I'm a writer, and I've had my fair share of people just not getting what I'm trying to express. I'm glad he has a good attitude about the whole thing, and I'm excited about the new stand-up special on Netflix."
Salvation,"IMO, John Mulaney's best assest is his story telling ability. If you've been to his most recent show, the way he captures the audience with the Clinton story is great.



(If you couldn't go to the show, wait for it to come out or just go ahead and listen to Salt and Pepper Diner and the rest of his other specials.)"
Salvation,I saw his show twice and both times it was terrible.  I get what he was aiming for but it just wasn't funny.
Salvation,[deleted]
Salvation,His stand up is so good and his show was so bad. I hope he pulls a Louis CK and knocks a second show out of the park or jumps onboard as head writer of SNL and gets that back on the rails. 
Salvation,[deleted]
Salvation,his show was terrible and his character was not likeable at all. I hate that he pulled Nasim Pedrad from SNL to do his show. She hasn't been seen since and she is so amazingly beautiful and talented that she deserves her own show.
Salvation,"He should make ""Oh, Hello"" the TV show."
Salvation,"His stand up special on Netflix is fucking phenomenal.  I recommend it to everyone its called ""New in Town"""
Salvation,I watched the first episode and it was literally just his stand up jokes acted out. Is that what the other episodes were like as well?
Salvation,It's because he didn't eat his morning Tuna Dollop.
Salvation,I saw John live last year...  Or early this year?  Doesn't matter. He was hilarious live.  Lots of audience interaction.
Salvation,"I saw his show while on the plane. It wasn't bad but it was just your standard run of the mill sitcom. I can't really watch anything with a laugh track anymore so it definitely wasn't for me, but other than that I can't see it as being any better or worse than the other sitcoms out there."
Salvation,His show was actually bearable if you imagined him being sarcastic the entire time.  
Salvation,Can't wait for the play! This guy is so talented and I hope to see him bounce back. 
Salvation,"Loved his standup, but even the commercials for his show seemed like it would be totally awful. His sitcom had a ""20 years too late"" vibe"
Salvation,I just saw him in Raleigh on Friday and he had me in stitches. I can't wait to see what makes his new special.
Salvation,I like him a lot. Hated the show. Not a huge fan of his stand up. But I really do like him as a person. There doesn't seem to be an ounce of entitlement in his attitude about the negative reception of the show. He's just sort of really got a very good handle on the whole thing. I tried it. It didn't work. I made some mistakes. Learned some things. On to the next. Stand up guy (no pun intended).
Salvation,"I guess my wife and I were the only ones who loved Mulaney.  To us it seemed like an absurdist take on sitcom tropes; ""let's see how ridiculous and sitcommy we can make it."""
Salvation,"Love him. Was actually at the taping for his new special coming to Netflix friday. Never watched his show, looked terrible. He's my favorite stand up though. "
Salvation,Who honestly compared this guy to Seinfeld?
Salvation,"I love his standup but that show was pretty awful. I gave it a few episodes and largely it was forgettable, except for one episode where, in a flashback, Mulaney's character is basically raped by Nasim Pedrad's character. "
Salvation,"I really like his stand-up, but his sitcom was basically Seinfeld 2015, but without the edge that Seinfeld had.  I don't know why anyone thought it would work.  "
Salvation,"He says in the interview that *The Carmichael Show* is smart and well written, should I be watching it?  It looks like it's all on Hulu, so that's nice."
Salvation,"I only watched the first episode of the show for 2-3 minutes before backing out.  Not surprised it got canceled, but can anyone who actually kept watching tell me if it got any better?"
Salvation,It got canceled because nobody wanted to see Seinfeld 2.0
Salvation,His show was complete garbage 
Salvation,Who?
Salvation,His show was god awful. The I trusted you guys and watched his standup. It was also awful. Mulaney blows.
Salvation,His show was an inferior rip-off of Seinfeld.  
Salvation,"He's sickeningly corny.  It's some of the most unimaginative, whitebread material I've ever heard, both his sitcom and his standup.  He's been told that he's funny by far too many people who didn't have the heart to tell him the truth. "
Salvation,He's just not funny -- in my opinion. 
Salvation,I like how Jay fucking Leno and Jerry fucking Seinfeld don't get why you'd want an hour long special on Netflix to raise your profile and get your name out there as a stand-up haha.
Salvation,Putting a show on Fox in itself is a gamble. That network premieres and cancels more shows than any other.
Salvation,Not everyone gets to be a big star. Boo Hoo. 
Salvation,I read this as John Oliver and was terrified. 
Salvation,Jesus! John was on Marc Maron **a year ago** lamenting that his show was going to be canceled. Let's move on John.
Salvation,Saw the commercial once said this looks boring and who is this?
Salvation,Saw the commercial once said this looks boring and who is this?
Salvation,If you have 45 minutes I'd like to tell you about our Lord and saviour Robin Williams.
Salvation,"Yeah he has such a wonderful way of delivering jokes, he has the perfect amount of self-deprecation, while still making jokes about other stuff.

""People looking over expecting a 100 year old blind dog who's texting and drinking a smoothie, instead they see a 28 year old man trying his best"""
Salvation,My girlfriend and I were fortunate enough to be able to go to the Chicago show where the new one was filmed. It's a riot! You won't be disappointed. 
Salvation,"Same here, he's my favorite stand up comedian.

Saw his show, first episode was basically all jokes from his New in Town special told poorly with horrible pacing and characters. He needs to stick to what he's good at which is writing material and not acting."
Salvation,I watched New In Town for the billionth time last night in preparation for the new special.  Too fucking hilarious.  Burr is my favorite comedian (Mulaney second) but New in Town is my favorite special by far.  I caught Mulaney here in Atlanta performing some of the stuff that's on his special I'm sure and it's just as good.
Salvation,"Confirmed, New in Town is one of the best stand up shows this decade.

Hope he doesn't let the failure of his show affect him too much.

Anything other than New in Town of his to watch?"
Salvation,"His stiffness is part of his act, but I think he was even stiffer in his show, and it just didn't work. I really like him as a comedian and hope he takes some acting classes, gets better producers, and writers to create new material for a better show. Seems like he tried to do too much also. With a TV show it's a whole team of incredibly talented people that need to come together, and while he's talented, it didn't seem like he had the rest of the crew talent he needed."
Salvation,"It's the pacing. Most of his stand up is funny ""on its own"", as in text, but in *all* of it he absolutely nails the sense of timing. And the show fucked it up to push more forced punchlines and laugh track into 22 minutes. "
Salvation,"He was the best live show I think I've ever gone to. For some reason I didn't expect him to swear as much as he did but it just made it that much funnier.

Did he do the thing where when someone left for the bathroom he basically had the whole audience troll them?"
Salvation,">  If you've been to his most recent show, the way he captures the audience with the Clinton story is great.

This is literally the closer on the special that's coming out Friday."
Salvation,"Marc Maron said it the best in his interview with him. he said, paraphrased, ""The quick perfect delivery you have works."" I think above the story telling is the quick rapidfire punchline he uses."
Salvation,"Yes, I think he's a better storyteller with himself just describing it, than actually showing you a scene of that same story."
Salvation,[deleted]
Salvation,"It was awful.  I don't care what y'all say, this show really tried to be like Seinfeld.  But Mulaney really should have researched more on Seinfeld's success.  Jerry didn't use his standup routine as the punchlines for all the jokes in his show.  He used his comedy and dove more into the subtleties that he was describing on stage.

With that said, I am looking forward to his next standup special."
Salvation,"> I get what he was aiming for

A Seinfeld ripoff? The whole idea was terrible."
Salvation,[removed]
Salvation,"The show was absolutely awful but his standup is fantastic. John Mulaney is obviously incredibly talented and funny but his material didn't really translate well to the sitcom genre.

If you ever get the chance, definitely go see him live. He is definitely the funniest comedian I have ever seen perform."
Salvation,"I don't understand why studio executives continue to green-light TV comedies with a live studio audience. It works on a very small number of shows, like Big Bang Theory but only because that show had great lead-ins, some unique characters, and garnered a loyal niche audience in the early seasons. Mulaney and [the almost-immediately-cancelled show with Mark-Paul Gosselaar](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt4481248/?ref_=nm_flmg_act_1)... why do these keep getting made? Why is it so easy for someone like me, with zero TV show production experience ever, to immediately know when a show is going to tank yet people who's job it is to know better sink millions of $$ into it?"
Salvation,[deleted]
Salvation,"I was always curious if it was just all him, and he didn't have enough support.  Like how Seinfeld had Larry David to help him out and bounce ideas off of to be more sitcom than stand up."
Salvation,">  I think the studio geared it to morons and kids in middle school.

So is reddit, and it's been very successful."
Salvation,"I thought the first three episodes of SNL this season were pretty damned good actually. Writers seldom come back to SNL, generally you do your time then move on to other projects, Mulaney will almost certainly not be coming back. "
Salvation,"Lauren Lapkus is one the funnies people on earth. She, Andy Daly and Paul F. Thompkins are my 3 favorite guests on CBB."
Salvation,Not familiar with Sodaro by name. But Lapkus and Mulaney? Yes please. 
Salvation,"I would've loved it if he appeared as George St. Geegland. I can imagine him in character hitting on Traci Reardon, undeterred by her age or physical features."
Salvation,I really tried to like Comedy Bang! Bang! but it was always just annoying to listen to and I never really found it funny. I keep hearing people love it and I wonder what the fuck is wrong with me.
Salvation,She plays a character who is mentally stuck in the 90s on a show called Scream Queens. It's a mostly silly satire of horror movies that has a semi-decent mystery element running throughout.
Salvation,I swear there was some buzz about Pedrad writing and starring in her own comedy series
Salvation,That's an inordinate amount of tuna. 
Salvation,"Same. At one point, a guy got up to go to the washroom and when the guy was going, Mulaney goes ""Okay, so at some point later, when he's back, I'm going to say ""Well, you know what they always say in Vancouver..."" and you'll go ""That's how we get our milkshakes!"" (Or something to that effect) and it'll be a big laugh.""

We did that exact thing and he was right."
Salvation,That was my gripe.  FOX just tried to capitalize off of his already existing jokes instead of letting the guy create something new.  He never had a chance.
Salvation,[deleted]
Salvation,"Yeah, to me it always felt like it would have been super popular in the late 90's/early 00's, when that format of sitcom was king. "
Salvation,I saw every episode. The show was so bad I wanted to keep watching to feel better about myself. It was absolutely unredeemable. Horrible. Truly horrible. With so many starving writers out there (note not me) - how the hell was this abortion created?
Salvation,It was just as bad as it looked and I really tried to like it.  New in Town is the greatest special I've ever seen and I'm a huge comedy fan.  I saw him last year in Atlanta and have seen the Clinton bit and presumably some of the other material on the special which was phenomenal.
Salvation,"They compare everything and one to Seinfeld.  Even always sunny in Philadelphia got called ""Seinfeld in a bar"" when it first premiered "
Salvation,Was Seinfeld's stand-up very famous before his show?
Salvation,"That's about his act, not his career trajectory. "
Salvation,"My Hyperbole, closely followed by Mr Regret"
Salvation,Came here to say this. Guy blows Big Bang hard
Salvation,"> He's been told that he's funny by far too many people who didn't have the heart to tell him the truth.

So he became a famous stand-up, a writer on SNL and had a network sitcom because no one told him he wasn't funny? It was too awkward to not give him two Netflix hour specials? What's so special about him then? Because by that logic literally everyone who tried stand-up would be as successful as him."
Salvation,"I think that's the problem. He's a good standup but you can tell that he's trying to emulate what worked 20 years ago in the comedy business. Now it's just looser and you don't have to be ""clean"" to get big. They compared his show failing to how Lucky Louie failed, that's a horrible comparison because that show failed because it was trying to break the conventions and tone of most sitcoms and this one failed for the exact opposite reason."
Salvation,"That's just, like, your opinion, man, okay? "
Salvation,(tipping intensifies) 
Salvation,His stand up is good
Salvation,"They were saying that the material wouldn't be ""old"" if they didn't release it."
Salvation,"They don't need to ""get it""; they're successful already.  They have nothing additional to achieve; what they want is to be able to keep doing stand-up, without it being stale to the audience because they've already seen it online.  In what fucking universe do Jay Leno and Jerry Seinfeld need to get their name out there?"
Salvation,But...he's already a big star.
Salvation,I think that it can be a little hard to recover from losing something you put your heart and soul into.
Salvation,"""I don’t drink, I used to drink and then I drank too much and I had to stop. That surprises a lot of audiences, because I don’t look like someone who used to do anything. I look like I was just sitting in a room, in a chair eating saltines for like 28 years and then I walked right out here."""
Salvation,I'm assuming it will largely be the same set he did recently here in Toronto for the JFL42 festival. Which had me and the friends I went with absolutely dying.
Salvation,This is what happened with Lucky Louie
Salvation,"He has a comedy album called The Top Part. Don't know how much is different material, but I'll be checking it out. "
Salvation,It's hard to pinpoint why a show doesn't connect with people. Transferring good stand-up to a sitcom can be like capturing lightning in a bottle. This time it just didn't quite happen. 
Salvation,Yeah the way he tells a story wouldn't work in the format networks look for
Salvation,Milkshakes? Yep.
Salvation,"Rehashed jokes from standup is basically every successful 90s comic sitcom pilot. It's super obvious in early Everybody Loves Raymond, Mad About You, and Ellen."
21 Thunder,"The number of people ITT who are upset *their* favorite show wasn’t on someone else’s entirely subjective list is a perfect microcosm of why /r/television and /r/movies kinda suck. You don’t need to be offended this guy liked other shows more. *Your* favorite is still *your* favorite.

OP took the time to write some pretty decent reviews for the shows, and even brought a few to my attention I hadn’t heard of that sound great. The Newsreader in particular.  There is no need to downvote this post"
21 Thunder,"I thought I watched a lot of tv this year but I didn't see even one of these shows. Most I have not even heard of.

Best show of the year? Dopesick, Succession, Mare of Easttown."
21 Thunder,"I'm always impressed by how varied your TV watching seems to be. I don't know how you have the time or the ability (access wise) to watch so many shows, especially international ones, but that's cool. Some of these sound really cool."
21 Thunder,"surprised heike monogatari is only 13. feels like it should be much higher with the amazing work they did on humanizing the various characters. Especially the struggles and decisions made by tokuko and the motivations behind them.

the production also did a fantastic job accurately depicting the historical setting. the beautiful and ugly. the luxury of the elite and the devastation endured by regular people. The social obligations and expectations everyone has to navigate and deal with. especially women.

the show is also not just aesthetically japanese or historically japanese but extremely culturally japanese. Especially the ending.

---

i really liked wonder egg priority and it was the perfect show for me up until episode 7. the beautiful art and amazing animation and fun characters along with tackling the difficult topic of suicide was really nice and meaningful.

But then I felt like it dropped the ball and focused on things that were antithetical to the topic of suicide. a focus on sci-fi for the sake of sci-fi instead of the raw reality that modern life is fucked for a lot of people.

the intentionality changed and with it, i felt like it ruined the show. >!(people killing themselves from their own volition as opposed to due to the machinations of a spooky AI daughter ghost out for revenge)!<

---

will check out blindspotting tho! nice list"
21 Thunder,"I'm so grateful for this list! I don't exactly know why, but I really growed bored of most american series I was watching. They have very good production values but I guess this list brings a very needed and refreshing cultural perspective. Thank you very much for taking the time to create this list of reviews!"
21 Thunder,This is the most pretentious shit I’ve ever seen.
21 Thunder,"Made a decision to watch less American shows this year.

Loved the Newsreader, Thunder in my heart and Threesome.

I wish Succession was on the list thou"
21 Thunder,"I’ve watched four from this list: Cruel Summer, Blindspotting, Squid Game, and Invincible. I liked three of the four. The other was OK. 

I’ve got Reservation Dogs, Maid, The Serpent, Anna, and Wonder Egg Priority on my watchlist already and have heard good things about all of them. 

I’m intrigued enough by the descriptions to add The Newsreader, Eden, Delete Me, and Sonny Boy to my watchlist. Hopefully they pop up,in my region at some point as I think of the bunch only Sonny Boy is available to me right now."
21 Thunder,"Not only did you put *Wonder Egg Priority* above *Odd Taxi*, you also put it at number 4 and the highest ranked anime. Furthermore, *Ousama-ranking* is missing as well (and presumably below *Wonder Egg Priority* according to this list). I can't comment on most of the other shows, because I haven't seen them, but the anime ranked on this is extremely sus. Of course everyone can have their own opinions, but with *Wonder Egg Priority* having such an awful ending even ignoring ep 13 (imo), I cannot see how it deserves to be above literally every other anime this year, let alone 4th among *all* shows this year. Among anime, also strange is *Horimiya* that high. It's actually one of my favorite manga because it's a nice wholesome read, but it quickly devolves into being quite generic after the strong start. I cannot see how it belongs at 19, let alone above *Odd Taxi*.

Also I admit I'm a fanboy of the show, but *Arcane* missing from the list is extremely suspect. It is the most nominated show at the Annies for a reason, getting a nomination count equal to Disney productions even though it was almost completely unknown (outside the LoL fanbase) before its release. Even if the story and characters are deemed just par, the technical component of the show alone should push it to a spot in a top 25 show of the year list. Also suspect is *Succession* missing, but you did mention elsewhere that you have yet to see it.

I appreciate the well written out thoughts on your top 25, I just think it's a really bizarre ranking. I will try to check out some of the shows you listed, some of them sound really interesting, so thanks for that."
21 Thunder,"Invincible only at 24?

No Arcane nor Ousama Ranking?

Attack on Titan S4P1 and Succession S3 also missed out."
21 Thunder,"I loved DP, Welcome to Utmark, and Anna"
21 Thunder,Thanks for putting all this work into your list. Makes it much easier for me!
21 Thunder,A best tv shows of 2021 lost really isn’t complete without Succession
21 Thunder,"Check out Yellowjackets, The Shrink Next Door, Scenes from a Marriage"
21 Thunder,That Arcane isn’t on this list is really sad - but each to their own!
21 Thunder,"What the hell. I heared none of these except maybe 2 titles. Also, where's Succession?

EDIT: Okay just realized entry number 3 is actually Squid Game."
21 Thunder,"Okay, I have some specific praises to give that may make this list make a little bit more sense.

What did you think of the list? Are there any shows you think that should be there that isn't (or vice-versa)? Any shows you think are ranked too high/too low?

**My overall thoughts on 2021 television**: Somehow I found more great shows this year than any other year... but none quite on the level of the top shows from 2020 or 2019 (*...does that make sense?*). There were a lot of bad endings, and quite a few shows on my list had inescapable downsides. But still I haven't seen everything I wanted to see this year as yet (Dopesick, My Name, Yellowjackets etc.), and maybe I'll update this list at the end of January if anything else stands out.

p.s. I'd like to give a shout out to @jramjee on twitter. Because of him I got access to a lot of inaccessible foreign TV shows. And also @L21sMa who took time out of his limited free time to do ~~some~~... in fact *a lot of* writing and editing for me. ❤️"
21 Thunder,Yellowjackets?
21 Thunder,I need to see Dopesick. Mare of Easttown was never going to be on this list. lol.
21 Thunder,"Okay firstly, sorry for the late reply to this. 

I had my issues with Heike. I don't think Heike laid out it's story (the genpai war) in a way that people not already familiar with it can fully understand. It's an anime for people already familiar with it (*which makes sense since the Japanese literally learn about the genpai wars in high school*). 

But don't misunderstand me now, even though I had my issues with it skipping pass (not animating) key moments the way it does, I still think it's a fantastic series and fully appreciate it. I mean... I watch over 60-70 new shows this year... so #13 is no small feat. 

> i really liked wonder egg priority and it was the perfect show for me up until episode 7. the beautiful art and amazing animation and fun characters along with tackling the difficult topic of suicide was really nice and meaningful.

> But then I felt like it dropped the ball and focused on things that were antithetical to the topic of suicide. a focus on sci-fi for the sake of sci-fi instead of the raw reality that modern life is fucked for a lot of people.

I agree... and disagree. I mean I don't want to go deep into Wonder Egg Priority post-episode 7 (which in true anime fashion introduced new ideas for the prospect of a big '*good vs evil*' final battle scene, that ultimately we didn't because of production issues), but as I said in another reply WEP accomplished what it needed to by said 7th episode... and it was incredibly impactful (*at least for me*), and nothing that came after (*as bad as it may or may not have been*) diminished that for me.

WEP was easily my #1 of 2021. And for all the reasons you meantion, ended up at #4 instead. But I'd also like to point out that I didn't just consider plot when making this list, so whatever shortcomings it may have developed in that department, to me it still had some of the best animation design, visuals, soundtrack and concept I've seen all of this year."
21 Thunder,Why?
21 Thunder,Stick to Vampire Diaries
21 Thunder,"😐 .... but... why? 

I'm actually curious since for some reason you got unvoted. 😅"
21 Thunder,Damn... I can't believe I found someone else besides me and Luis who watched Thunder in My Heart and Threesome. lol.
21 Thunder,-*raises glass and nods in approval*-
21 Thunder,"Okay, great reply! Answering this will be challenging but let's see if I can explain my decision making here. lol. 

First off, nothing is *suspect*, it's just my opinion, honestly. 

> Not only did you put Wonder Egg Priority above Odd Taxi, you also put it at number 4 and the highest ranked anime.

Wonder Egg Priority was actually my #1 show of 2021 before I watch that underproduced ending (*I actually saw it very late too, and read a few comments about the production issues they had*). But despite the unfortunate ending I didn't discard what came before. For me, it's still one of the most impactful and beautiful anime I've ever seen. And honestly, I feel like everything the anime needed to accomplished, it already did by the 7th episode. So it wasn't something that needed a great ending to be significant... it already was. The ending was really just to wrap-up the story. Some viewers put a lot of weight on ending, almost to the point where a great show is now a bad one if it doesn't have a satisfying one, but I don't.

> Among anime, also strange is Horimiya that high. It's actually one of my favorite manga because it's a nice wholesome read, but it quickly devolves into being quite generic after the strong start. I cannot see how it belongs at 19, let alone above Odd Taxi.

ODDTAXI is ranked below Horimiya because of visuals tbh. Plot-wise, Odd Taxi is far superior, but remember, I'm not just considering plot, I'm also considering production design, soundtrack, cinematography etc. (also why Wonder Egg Priority is ranked so high). 

> I will try to check out some of the shows you listed, some of them sound really interesting, so thanks for that.

Yea, you're welcome. Recommending shows is always my main reason for posting these listicles."
21 Thunder,"I loved Invincible so much that even though it wasn't the more unique or creative thing... and even though I was very underwhelmed by the art-style, it still made the list. 

As for Arcane, [well............](https://c.tenor.com/9pxLR-8u5z4AAAAC/homer-simpson-hiding.gif)

I haven't seen Ranking of Kings. 

And I'm the biggest Attack on Titan fan but as you can see I'm not very open to adding returning shows to my end of year lists."
21 Thunder,"Invincible was my nr 1 show this year. I had no expectations going in, I had not read the comics. And I was absolutely blown away."
21 Thunder,I haven't seen the new season yeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeet! 😩
21 Thunder,Ted Lasso anybody?
21 Thunder,I have no interest in checking out the U.S. remake of Scenes from a Marriage tbh. But Yellowjackets is already on my list of course. I'll see with The Shrink Next Door too.
21 Thunder,"> I heared none of these except maybe 2 titles.

That's suppose to be a good thing. Check them out. 

> Also, where's Succession?

I haven't seen the new season as yet."
21 Thunder,No wonder I haven't seen any of the shows you consider top of 2021. Obviously we have vastly different tv preference.
21 Thunder,"can not believe you got downvoted for not liking mare of red herrings. kate winslet must have had a sore back after carrying that piece of shit tv show. your list is very interesting btw, definitely gonna check some of these out"
21 Thunder,"ended up watching blindspotting and it was everything you described and more. really really great show and solid recommendation.

it felt like an upgrade on hamilton which was already pretty ground breaking.

very deserving of the #1 spot on your list and also now #1 on my list"
21 Thunder,"Have you seen ""Beforeigners""?"
21 Thunder,Nordic shows are great
21 Thunder,Uhhhhh... it doesn't have to be *that* vast. lol. I just found Mare of Easttown to be very unoriginal tbh. Great performances though.
21 Thunder,"I did [a review of Mare](https://www.reddit.com/r/television/comments/npc6zj/great_performances_and_characters_saves_mare_of/) basically saying the same thing. Kate carried that show, there was just... noting else to it besides the character work and acting."
21 Thunder,"Awww.. THANK YOU! 😄💕 

It makes me happy that you watch it and even happier than you enjoyed it. 

It seems like you actually *got it*. And that's nice to see because not everyone does. I remember me and this other TV critic friend of mine agreeing that it was easily one of the best shows we'd seen for the year (and we rarely agree on anything), but the reaction from imdb and a lot of the comments here didn't think so. It's creativity, and I guess the point of it all, really just flew over their heads. 

You're the 2nd person who've watched it from my recommendation and loved it, so thank you. hehe. 

But anyways, you seem to be an anime fan, so if you could recommend me a few anime similar to Heike or Anohana: The Flower We Saw That Day I'd appreciate it."
21 Thunder,"Uhh, no, not yet but plan to."
21 Thunder,"Hmm, animes similar to Heike are probably 

- Angolmois: Record of Mongol Invasion

- Vinland Saga

for the historical perspective. But they're much more ""anime"". Other stuff by Science Saru is also usually just ""good"" though. Like 

- Eizouken ni wa Te wo Dasu na!

---

honorable mention goes to 

- Mars Red

for being different and interesting. The CGI is pretty rough though but it's also based on a Japanese historical period. (Taisho era). And focuses around the corruption of the japanese military, and vampires. lol. It's based on a stage play that's sort of an adaptation on Salomé by Oscar Wilde."
21 Thunder,"Plot can be mundane, but realistic world building is top, you know, like Scandi series often do, like ""Akta Manniskor""."
21 Thunder,Thanks a lot. It's been so long since I asked I thought you forgot. 😅💕
21 Thunder,I havent seen Akta either but I know what you're talking about. lol.
21 Thunder,Shocked It’s a Wonderful Life isn’t on the itinerary.
21 Thunder,Pretty interesting the only movie from the 90's is Little Women. Pretty rare to see something so recent on TCM.
21 Thunder,I think NBCUniversal hoards the rights to that on broadcast and on cable (seen it on USA before)
21 Thunder,Amazon Prime Video has it. 
21 Thunder,It got so oversaturated in the 70's and 80's- it makes me glad NBC only plays it twice a year.
21 Thunder,2nd and 3rd movies in the list are from the '90s
21 Thunder,Interestingly I had never heard of those and they were by the same woman that's no longer with us: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarah_Jacobson

21 Thunder,Will they ever show Angels with Dirty Faces on TCM again!? 
Midnight Sun,Swedish-French show. It's a co-production between Canal+ and Sweden.
Midnight Sun,"I liked it a lot... Another good Swedish show is 'Beck', a 20 year old show that cranked out some new episodes this year (With a lot of the original cast)...I also found the 1993 version of 'Beck'...I actually got it years ago, but just now found subtitles for it...lol...These cops sometimes even solve crimes without gunfire..."
Midnight Sun,"I especially liked that they kinda wove two different shows together: a standard Swedish ""Nordic Noir"" thriller, and a passionate French drama (Kahina's storyline). It made the show kinda unique. "
Midnight Sun,[deleted]
Midnight Sun,"A really really good swedish serie is ""Tusenbröder"" I don't know if there's is english subtitles for it tho."

Midnight Sun,"Re:Zero Season 1, Episode 15: ""The Outside of Madness"" is easily one of the most amazing experiences I've had watching any show. It is regularly *the* episode I point to as the one that locked in the series as one of the greats for me. Mind you, it was helped a lot by weekly viewing as it released giving me a lot of time to really soak in everything that led up to it, and then the punches just start coming and don't stop for the whole episode. We also get the introduction of one of the most amazing villains I've ever seen. My brain was truly trembling at that episode.

Re:Zero Season 2, Episode 4: ""Parent and Child"" is the most recent episode and also very good, though I expect we may get even better episodes this season, so it may get overshadowed. Still, the demonstration of Subaru's growth and the opportunity for him to get closure on his past make this episode extremely moving.

While not quite a single episode, My Hero Academia's all for one/one for all episodes are a thing. Definitely worth a watch."

Midnight Sun,"Veep - 5x04 “Mother” - This was just a step above the usual energy of the show. It felt like every line of dialogue had me in stitches while showing a rare side of Selina that we’ve never seen (or will again) in the series. It ends in such a pitch perfect note too.

Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt - 3x08 “Kimmy Does a Puzzle!” - Similar to the above, it’s like every line had me in stitches as the episode finally answers in hilarious detail an ongoing mystery that began at the start of the season. It also develops the relationship between Titus and Kimmy and mostly puts to rest their problems with one another. To top it all off the episode also has Maya Rudolph to add to the hilarity.

Mad Men - 5x10 “The Other Woman” - What a knockout. As if the main story wasn’t incredible and sad enough on its own, it ends on such a powerful note as the main relationship of the series is abruptly altered. There are many, many single episodes of this show that I could’ve mentioned but this one I think stands out among all of them.

Haikyuu - 3x04 “The Halo Around The Moon” - Pays off a slowly developing character arc in such a spectacular, satisfying, and fist-pumping moment. It represents all the best things about the series and even though this takes place before the season is even at its halfway point, it feels like a such a monumental moment in the overall story."

Midnight Sun,"The Vampire Diaries S02E15 'The Dinner Party' This is probably the single episode that plays most to the strengths of the show. It is full of twist and suspense and and plot moves at twice the speed  of most other show. In general the entire second season is just excellent, with the focus on the three best antagonist the show ever had (Katherine, Elijah and Kalus )

Heroes S01E17 'Company Man' - Mr Bennet's black and white flashback episode. Probably one of the only episode of the series that I feel stood the test of time after more than a decade... and I would also say that it remains the best thing Bryan Fuller has ever made.

The Clone Wars S07E10 'The Phantom Apprentice - I know most people would say either of the next two episodes are even better, and while they are absolutely amazing, this one was the highest peak of the series for me. I know Ray Park did some really shitty stuff recently, but holy shit that motion capture was awesome.

Dexter S04E09 'Hungry Man' - The thanksgiving episode with the Trinity killer... I was absolutely captivated... also, as an Eastern European teenager, this was the first I ever heard the c word in a television show and I was just shocked to the core by it.

Lost S04E05 'The Constant' Desmond and Penny are simply so likeable that they can easily carry an episode on their own. But they also incuded some excellent stuff with Faraday, Sayid being an awsome dude as always, and the sudden jump cuts for the time shifts are just masterful in contrast to the usual flashback effect.

Prison Break S01E20 'Tonight' - The montage of all the main characters thinking about their motivation to escape and Sarah contemplating whether she should help Michael set to 'Teardrop' by Massive Attack is still chilling to this day. I don't know why but this episodes just really works for me.

Rebels Season 2 Finale 'Twilight of the Apprentice - I wish the entire show was like this one episode. It has dozens of excellent fights, a really cool, unique and creepy location, really surprising shakeups of the status quo and two iconic villains with amazing voice acting."

Love Live! School Idol Project,This is amazing.
Love Live! School Idol Project,"I remember being Sailor Moon obsessed in the early '00s. My cousin found the bootleg trailer on a toonami fansite (on Quicktime). I had so many questions. I never expected to ever see actual footage and oh, is it more of a trainwreck than I thought it would be."
Love Live! School Idol Project,The best part of this is >!that it was just sitting in the Library of Congress for copyright protection!<. Imagine all the lost media just sitting there waiting to be stumbled upon.
Love Live! School Idol Project,"Forget dodging a bullet, We dodged a Scud Missile"
Love Live! School Idol Project,"Fascinating stuff, it's wild how Sailor Moon ended up as an enormously popular aesthetic in the west despite executives fighting it as much as possible, makes you wonder what would have happened if it and other anime were given a bigger push."
Love Live! School Idol Project,Lol Venus washing her face with a loofa wtf
Love Live! School Idol Project,"The song though. My god. It reminded me of “How I Met Your Mother.” 

“Let’s go to the mall… today!”"
Love Live! School Idol Project,"My mind is blown by how obvious it is they studied the source material and how randomly it’s implemented in the show. 

They used the crystal compact and some of the hand gestures when the sailors used some of their attacks, but tuxedo mask doesn’t get his top hat? 

And now imagine, if you would, this is a mid to late 2000s Disney Channel project starring Hilary Duff as sailor moon.

I wonder if it could have all worked somehow."
Love Live! School Idol Project,"I barely made it to the end of the intro song but absolutely loved the early 90’s checklist that went into it. “Lessee, need a black kid, an Asian kid, somebody in a wheelchair… inclusivity goddammit! Need a montage of trying on different hats and being wacky. Dammit Johnson, more Breakfast Club references! I demand that weird 80’s dance. What kind of hack writing am I paying you for?”"
Love Live! School Idol Project,"This is one of those ""it's so bad that it's good"" sort of things."
Love Live! School Idol Project,"I love the 90s theme song that has to explain the premise, and then once the episode starts it moves right into War of the Worlds.
Also, great that they had to give them windsurfers and boats so their was a reason for them to be sailors.

Amazing stuff."
Love Live! School Idol Project,"I guess the sailboards and sailing vessel-style vehicles were to make the ""Sailor"" part of ""Sailor Moon"" make sense to American kids, but I wonder why they bothered to keep the sailor *fuku* uniforms if that were the case. I suppose it was to appeal to fans of the anime, although I can't imagine a fan of the anime not being completely turned off by this."
Love Live! School Idol Project,classic 90s tv - they get actors in their late 20s to play 16 yr olds
Love Live! School Idol Project,More importantly… Is Sailor Mercury in black face?
Love Live! School Idol Project,People in the lost media community knew about this for a bit but it was hidden and behind a lot of collectors; and we only got snippets before. This is huge.
Love Live! School Idol Project,"There’s a timeline where we grew up with this instead of the Dub of the real thing. What a horrible, horrible reality."
Love Live! School Idol Project,"I remember seeing footage* of this wayy back in the day!!

*the footage being someone using a old home movie camera to record the footage being played at a convention back in the late 90’s lol"
Love Live! School Idol Project,*so what do they call you? Wheels?*
Love Live! School Idol Project,"Damn, that was awful. Thank God it didn't make it."
Love Live! School Idol Project,That’s really freaking cool
Love Live! School Idol Project,Burn it. Fear it. Dread it. Run from it
Love Live! School Idol Project,This is so cool!
Love Live! School Idol Project,"As a kid I would've never admitted to watching Sailor Moon, but thank God it was the original that we got and not... whatever that was.  I live in Canada... I guess because the dub work was done in Canada, it aired in Canada first so I was watching it as early as 1995 on television and I would've been around 10 years old.  It was this airing at normal hours and the original Dragon Ball airing at really weird hours in the night where the only hope of seeing it was randomly waking up in the middle of the night.  These two were my first experiences with anime that I can remember."
Love Live! School Idol Project,"So they fly on windsurfing boards and one of them is in a wheelchair that turns into a hoverchair when they transform, also it's live action mixed with animation. I feel like we both dodged a bullet and were robbed of a spectacular trainwreck."
Love Live! School Idol Project,Ray Mona was also the one that discovered the lost Mean Girls game. A real legend.
Love Live! School Idol Project,I remember hearing about this ages ago. Glad it's been discovered
Love Live! School Idol Project,This thinking about another time line got weird American remakes instead of dubbed anime.
Love Live! School Idol Project,“Americanized”
Love Live! School Idol Project,Did they use Jeff Wayne's War of the Worlds in the track right after the opening song? Wtf
Love Live! School Idol Project,"I’m getting some extreme Power Rangers meets Sabrina the Teenage Witch vibes, which makes sense coming from Saban, lol. The dialogue is terrible, reminiscent of 80s/90s shows and honestly, I’m intrigued by the idea of this show, lol."
Love Live! School Idol Project,"I remember hearing about this like, a decade ago from moviebob, i think. Glad someone was able to find more of it because this shit is wild."
Love Live! School Idol Project,great value sailor moon
Love Live! School Idol Project,I don't think this pilot really is as bad as a lot of commenters are saying it is. The animation is decent and the cheesy feel of the live action scenes was on par with a lot of 90s kids shows. Sabrina was a big show back then so that cat stuff wasn't odd for the time either. I think this show could've worked and been successful.
Love Live! School Idol Project,"This is terrible but not so terrible to loop right back around to being awesome (like Captain Planet).

Quite an accomplishment."

Love Live! School Idol Project,If only this video was so cringe 🤦 neat footage and story though
Love Live! School Idol Project,Hey I know who that is. Thats the girl that found the mean girls ds game and refused to give the rom. Still not over that one
Love Live! School Idol Project,I think is is an absolutely horrible piece of shit and I’m glad it didn’t get made. Why did they think it would a good idea? Everyone needs to see the live action sailor moon.
Love Live! School Idol Project,"The cynic in me is constantly nagging in the back of my mind that at this point in time, it's hilariously easy to find ""lost footage"" of anything that is rumored to have existed at some point. 

Like the conspiracy theory of content creators injecting themselves into VINE compilations of yester year to retroactively create clout."
Love Live! School Idol Project,"I dunno. This is awesome. But burying the pilot in a multi hour story feels a bit self congratulatory. It’s like we have to high five her a lot _before_ getting the goods (which start an hour and  49 minutes into the doc). Like I would have preferred the sort of short two minute intro and then a supplementary doc. Not to undermine, but it does feel a bit presumptuous of the audience. Find for Patreon subscribers, less so for general audiences. And consequently rather than hearing a brief intro I like many will just skip to the right part."
Love Live! School Idol Project,"Seems cool, but why would they make a separate Americanized version instead of just translating the original? Are Americans so racist that they can’t watch a cartoon just because the pictures show somebody from another race?"
Love Live! School Idol Project,Cat is adorable
Love Live! School Idol Project,"This is going to sound horribly sexist, but there are exactly 2 reasons why this failed."
Love Live! School Idol Project,"I’m confused, how is it “lost media” if it was in the Library of Congress.  That’s like discovering a “gold mine” of seeds in the doomsday vault after an ecosystem collapse."
Love Live! School Idol Project,"Damn that’s cool asf, timelines are converging and here we are with cool shit."
Love Live! School Idol Project,Anyone think that was Tika Sumpter in the pilot?
Love Live! School Idol Project,NO WAY

Love Live! School Idol Project,That’s awesome this was found. Haven’t had a chance to watch it yet but I will shortly. Commenting to save it lol
Love Live! School Idol Project,...was there a sailor scout in a wheelchair in space?
Love Live! School Idol Project,I have a primitive x sailor moon white hoodie and I get mad compliments for it from people who also love this anime. Looking forward to sharing this lost media find with my younger sister who is also an even bigger fan of the series!
Love Live! School Idol Project,"If THIS is what we got instead of the dubbed sailor moon, I would of legit cried.  It was already bad enough having Super Sentai adapted. This would have been a nightmare for the anime fans."
Love Live! School Idol Project,"In an insane kind of way, yeah.

[Here's the footage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qWP1Dz-egw)

The producers of Power Rangers couldn't just recycle footage from the original Sailor Moon anime (like they did PR). So in-between the filmed segments they went to the trouble of animating a whole new cartoon for the action scenes.

And then like three years later after this idea flopped, someone else decided it'd just be easier to dub the original anime for America."
Love Live! School Idol Project,The intro looks like a mix between a commercial for the board game Mall Madness and a porn parody
Love Live! School Idol Project,"Yes, I distinctly remember having seen some of this live action material before when I went through my Sailor Moon phase in ‘00-‘01. I remember the girl in the wheelchair specifically. I don’t recall if I ever saw any of the animation though - all I remember is the live action."
Love Live! School Idol Project,"I definitely took the same thing away from this. 

All lost media may not be lost, just stashed away. 

I’ve been trying to come up with something lost that’s worth trying to find."
Love Live! School Idol Project,Why did you put a spoiler on that?
Love Live! School Idol Project,Yeah the thing is you can't get a copy of this kind of stuff unless you have written permission from the copyright holder :/ (which the girl that got this pilot managed to get)
Love Live! School Idol Project,This the same way they recently found the lost episode of [Sesame Street with Margret Hamilton](https://www.primetimer.com/news/lost-1976-episode-sesame-street-too-scary)
Love Live! School Idol Project,I can't believe we're less than 2 years away from The Day The Clown Cried from being released. It's been so long
Love Live! School Idol Project,"There's more to it including a Saban adaptation of Saint Seiya. Apparently, you can just find it in a public search engine for LOC. Even Harmony Gold Dragon Ball is in there too.

Love Live! School Idol Project,She was using it like it was a soft powder puff omg
Love Live! School Idol Project,"Oh my god. My husband wanted to know what had me scream-laughing on my phone this morning, but I couldn’t possibly explain what I was seeing."
Love Live! School Idol Project,I’m pretty sure it was implying that she was using it to apply makeup.
Love Live! School Idol Project,What's wrong with that?
Love Live! School Idol Project,Timestamp ?
Love Live! School Idol Project,"Ah okay, so I was correct in questioning whatever she was doing with that loofa, I thought it was a ""guys wouldn't understand"" moment."
Love Live! School Idol Project,The line she said while doing it was blatantly homoerotic. Good to see they planned on keeping up that tradition from both the original and dub.
Love Live! School Idol Project,"Honestly, based on how long it went on for, I was expecting something like ""Too Many Cooks"", and that it would keep on going."
Love Live! School Idol Project,That was exactly my first thought.
Love Live! School Idol Project,"Well he IS Tuxedo Mask, not Tuxedo Tophat"
Love Live! School Idol Project,"I… almost think THAT hypothetical version could have worked, with a twist: Hilary Duff is a typical white American girl in her mid-twenties, who is suddenly empowered to become a classic anime Magical Girl, with all the juvenile fluff and frills attached. 

Suddenly, she’s forced to fight for truth and love and the hearts of little girls everywhere, despite having zero interest in doing so. And other unwilling or unexpected people are having the same experience, so she’s on a team with, idk, Sandra Oh and William Jackson Harper."
Love Live! School Idol Project,"At the the animation would have been better looking, and maybe the acting… maybe."
Love Live! School Idol Project,"It's interesting because the adaptation sent them to a boarding school with school uniforms, but they're standard blazer uniforms, not sailor fuku."
Love Live! School Idol Project,Sometimes even in their 30s...
Love Live! School Idol Project,This is still a thing. Easier to work with adults and less legal hassles.
Love Live! School Idol Project,Uh...that's still the same in 2022. What's the point of this comment?
Love Live! School Idol Project,"Heck, the guy that plays Paxton Hall-Yoshida on Never Have I Ever is thirty-one. That just filmed!"
Love Live! School Idol Project,Going by how child actors were treated in 90s prob for the best
Love Live! School Idol Project,"I think the actresses were between 17-22. I know  “Sailor Mercury” was under 18.

Also getting actors in their late 20’s to play teenagers is still a thing."
Love Live! School Idol Project,"Holy shit, I thought you meant the live actress"
Love Live! School Idol Project,?
Love Live! School Idol Project,"No kidding. I'm actually kinda stunned at how different my childhood would have gone if this had been what we got, and no dub."
Love Live! School Idol Project,One where DBZ also a result didn't get a major hit dub either.
Love Live! School Idol Project,The whaaaaat?
Love Live! School Idol Project,"I agree. It's super cheesy but that was de rigeur. And the multicultural cast has looped around into popularoty again. I also think it's very cool that Mercury has a space wheelchair too, and she doesn't transform into a hero who can walk around. That's kind of a big deal, as small as it is."
Love Live! School Idol Project,Is an animal convention a furrie con?
Love Live! School Idol Project,"A bootlegged recording of that being screened at a convention was the only footage known to have existed for 28 years, until Ray Mona tracked this down."
Love Live! School Idol Project,"I mean, go find some then lol. Took her about half a year for this, so you should be even faster having a guide to work off of."
Love Live! School Idol Project,"The format though is setup as a documentary around finding the lost pilot for American Sailor Moon and it shows the efforts they did to get as much information needed to find the lost footage. It also offers a good insight on what was going on at those studios during the start of anime being accepted in America.

~~Plus I am sure the YouTuber will release the video files/upload them to Archive.org which they did for the Mean Girls DS game they got a hold of.~~  


Edit: scratch that, I mis-remembered, they can't upload the ROM of the Mean Girls DS game as that would put them in legal hot water. But they did a full playthrough and had someone help with debugging. So I am betting they can't upload the pilot without the watermark they added, since they got legal permission to show via YouTube."
Love Live! School Idol Project,That's why I posted the article... it links timestamped right to the that part of the video.
Love Live! School Idol Project,"Until the late 90s, what few anime series made it to the US weren't exactly treated very well."
Love Live! School Idol Project,"...no dude. That's not the reason. Anime wasn't a thing in the US at the time outside of VHS tapes really, until Toonami launched. I guess networks and cable companies weren't sure it would do well with American audiences because basically everything about anime was different from American animation at the time."
Love Live! School Idol Project,"The main character was a blonde girl with big round eyes. Visually, you can't even tell she's supposed to be japanese. What they ultimately ended up doing was just changing her name (to Serena) to hide her original nationality. They presumably did this because they thought american kids would have a hard time relating to japanese characters, or at least would have trouble remembering  the foreign names. Its not good to immediately jump to racism."

The Idolmaster Cinderella Girls,The trust fund bit was by far my favorite.
The Idolmaster Cinderella Girls,"The whole bit with James where everyone just assumes he's gay, no matter how many times he insists otherwise."
The Idolmaster Cinderella Girls,I love the show. So many hilarious moments. Sister Michael is fucking brilliant.
The Idolmaster Cinderella Girls,"Watch Orla. Orla in the background, reacting, is brilliant."
The Idolmaster Cinderella Girls,Remember that police scene with Liam Neeson. Oh for suffering Jesus
The Idolmaster Cinderella Girls,"I think one of my favorite moments is in season one when Colm is over for dinner. 

He’s going on about something and they think he’s done talking, he starts up again, and Ma Mary just goes “Jesus wept” under her breath. 

Their dry, Irish humor is just so fantastic! I know the show is focused on the kids, but the comedy from all the adults involved just cracks me UP."
The Idolmaster Cinderella Girls,"There’s a holiday special Bake Off episode with them, it’s a must watch."
The Idolmaster Cinderella Girls,"I need to catch up on Seasons 2 and 3. Season 1 has some great lines. I like the end of episode 1 when they all get called into Sister Michael's office:

Michelle: ""Nobody actually gets expelled. Rhonda Gallagher hasn't even been expelled and she's in the IRA.""

Erin: ""I'd say that's probably why.""

Then Clare dobs them all in:

Clare: So it had nothing to do with me! Yes, okay, I was there. I admit that, but I didn't do anything. It was Michelle. It was all Michelle. I'm not going down for something I didn't do. If anyone deserves to get punished, it should be Michelle.

Sister Michael: Well I think it's safe to say, we all just lost a bit of respect for you there, Clare."
The Idolmaster Cinderella Girls,"James gets hate online?! He’s so nice to everyone though, I don’t see a reason to hate him. I think I teared up when he was about to leave but ended up staying"
The Idolmaster Cinderella Girls,As someone who is Irish and grew up in the 80s/90s (80s baby) it definitely was nostalgic and brought out some big feelings and big laughs. I can related too well to some bits and cringed. Lol. But I think they also captured the troubles well and how it affected their lives.
The Idolmaster Cinderella Girls,"The Uncle Colm with Liam Neeson scene was the best. I had never laughed this hard before. 

And the show in itself is incredibly well written. 10/10 will recommend"
The Idolmaster Cinderella Girls,What business have you with Seamus!?
The Idolmaster Cinderella Girls,"""everyone keeps using the word wee for things that aren't even very small!"" 

-James"
The Idolmaster Cinderella Girls,I think I like Gerry (the dad) and Joe (the grandad) the best. I think they have some of the best lines or encounters. With each other and with other characters.
The Idolmaster Cinderella Girls,"My favorite ep is when Mary ""killed"" her Aunt 😂 Almost died laughing lol

*""How's the wicked witch of the northwest?""*

Other fave quotes:

""Killing nuns now, is it?"" 

""WINKING? At your age?! Christ, I feel SICK!""

*When Erin thought Claire was into her when she came out as a lesbian* ""I'm not interested in you like that, look at the state of you"""
The Idolmaster Cinderella Girls,"The bit with James in the chippy is hilarious. The way he says ITS MUCH, MUCH TOO GREASY! and the faces on the other girls crack me up. I think Orla even covers her ears.

And of course Dennis' GET OUT! 

Sister Micheal is a blessing. The way she hates Father Peter. Dose!"
The Idolmaster Cinderella Girls,Orla is hilarious. Her dance act where she just stepped up onto a single step was beautiful
The Idolmaster Cinderella Girls,"Uncle Colm is my favourite, just phenomenal dead pan. 

It reminds me so much of A Moody Christmas an Australian mini series with a similar Uncle Terry character who cannot stop giving people street directions or enquiring about which route they took to get there. Another show that captures a particular cultural ‘normal’ view of life."
The Idolmaster Cinderella Girls,"“Am I dead? Is this my wake?” 
Love that show"
The Idolmaster Cinderella Girls,"This is a fact.

It’s 3 perfect seasons - with a 12/10 finale bit

It’s wholesome and sad and funny and perfect"
The Idolmaster Cinderella Girls,"i’ve re watched the first two seasons probably at least 20 times in the past year and a half. it’s easy to just have on repeat and play in the background. it’s short and sweet, but i’m still catching things i missed. truly an amazing show!!!"
The Idolmaster Cinderella Girls,"Yes, the show has so much to offer. Satisfying character development, laughs abound and of course some sweet tender looks at the humanity of the family during “The Troubles”. Very unique."
The Idolmaster Cinderella Girls,"It’s one of the best pilots of any show. 

James not being able to use the teachers bathroom. The old nun that steals from the girls and then Michelle’s mom saying “sorry I’m late they shut down the bridge. I told them to let me risk it but didn’t”"
The Idolmaster Cinderella Girls,"Having grown up in that part of the world at that time  (I'm a couple of years older than the characters portrayed in the show) there are many wee details that are absolutely spot on.

For example, in one episode there is a mention of a kebab shop in Coleraine - Abrakebabra. Well that was a real place that a mate of mine ran...."
The Idolmaster Cinderella Girls,Love Sister Michael!!
The Idolmaster Cinderella Girls,"I was recently thinking uncle Colm's monologue about Tommy Duddy eating paper is one of the funniest things I've seen in a long time, I was genuinely howling at that"
The Idolmaster Cinderella Girls,truly one of the funniest and best shows in recent memory.  husband and i had to watch with subtitles on since we're american.  it managed to take a difficult and dark situation and make it absolutely hilarious -- charming and beautiful and bittersweet.  all the characters and the actors who played them were phenomenal.  i wish more of my friends would watch this so i could talk about it with them.
The Idolmaster Cinderella Girls,I’ve been to Ireland twice to see family and explore and during my last trip while in Derry we caught them filming the episode the president visited lol. It was an awesome experience and now whenever I show people the episode I tell them “I was right there off screen!” Lol
The Idolmaster Cinderella Girls,"I ugly-cried at the series finale- I was totally incapacitated. The perfect blend of hope, trepidation, and just extreme sadness to realize the toll that the troubles have taken on their adolescence - a transformative bit of TV."
The Idolmaster Cinderella Girls,"It took me like 2 years, but when I finally gave it a chance, it had some really solid moments, and reminds me a lot of Father Ted in the comedic delivery and hijinx"
The Idolmaster Cinderella Girls,Probably the best comedic written show since Arrested Development. It bums me out that I only know like 2 other people that have watched it
The Idolmaster Cinderella Girls,"I’m American, but was in High School (catholic all girls high school, even) during the early 90’s, so this show is absolutely gold to me. 

The writing is brilliant, the actors are phenomenal, and it’s just so, so fucking funny. I’ve watched the whole thing through countless times, and I always find something new to laugh at."
The Idolmaster Cinderella Girls,I agree I love Derry girls one of the funniest shows. I binged the first two season when I was sick with Covid and it cheered me up like no other show could. Also I think Sister michael is one best characters on any sitcom ever.
The Idolmaster Cinderella Girls,Now that it's over I need Derry Girls to become like The Sopranos where every discussion thread just devolves in to exchanging quotes because they make me so happy.
The Idolmaster Cinderella Girls,i want more Sister Michael.
The Idolmaster Cinderella Girls,"Just started this last, loved the first episode"
The Idolmaster Cinderella Girls,Uncle Colm telling the story of having his car stolen…. Brilliant!
The Idolmaster Cinderella Girls,Sister George Michael stole the show.
The Idolmaster Cinderella Girls,Show is absolutely cracker
The Idolmaster Cinderella Girls,"It really is amazing.  A sitcom about ordinary people in extraordinary times, funny in an intensely feminine way, just very very special.  I did feel like the last season lost a little bit of the perfection of the first two, as the stories got a little zanier (>!accidentally helping rob a school, getting sent across the border to clean up a house that felt haunted, planning an elaborately fancy 18th birthday party, going on TV to get backstage passes and then a parent dying, and honestly even the letter getting to Chelsea Clinton, which was a scene that's not likely to age as well as the rest of the show!<) and it felt less like ordinary life.  Regardless, BRILLIANT show and the >!voting!< storyline in the finale coupled with music choices that echoed the first episode's were absolutely brilliant, beautiful, ending on a real high."
The Idolmaster Cinderella Girls,"I'm Australian and get tired very quickly of most US and UK comedy shows. Will always jump onto anything from a different English-speaking country that's offering something different. The Young Offenders (another Irish comedy) scratched that itch a few years ago and I still miss it. Derry Girls was a lockdown discovery that really got to me. Grew up during the 90's, so the soundtrack was 'chefs kiss'. 

It's a very different vibe, but I strongly recommend you check out Rosehaven. If you enjoy watching the hijinx of good friends living in a land that is foreign to you, Rosehaven is a delight. NZ is kicking Australia's ass when it comes to comedy lately, but Rosehaven is a timeless classic that will warm your heart. Two best friends writing, directing and acting as two best friends in a rural Australian town. Kinda like a far less crazy Schitt's Creek."
The Idolmaster Cinderella Girls,100% agree. It's just a perfect encapsulation of time.
The Idolmaster Cinderella Girls,Orla’s belief that lesbians were mythical creatures was one of the funniest through lines in any comedy episode I’ve watched.
The Idolmaster Cinderella Girls,"The last season was so, so good! I'm so sad to see it go, but I think they ended it flawlessly."
The Idolmaster Cinderella Girls,"One of the best series of the year, they are amazing, very smart way to connect the history to young audience, insanely funny and great cast."
The Idolmaster Cinderella Girls,I love their accent
The Idolmaster Cinderella Girls,"I agree with this whole heartedly. I saw a review for Derry Girls one that said it can make you nostalgic for a time and place you never lived, and that is so true. I've told myself ""it's illegal to be sad while watching Derry Girls,"" so it's something I've often put on when I'm feeling down as a pick me up. Reading these comments has me on the verge of tears with the desire to watch the show over for the first time, but instead, I'll have to survive with a rewatch. Uncle Colm stole the show at the police department and have used the phrase ""the wee lesbian"" soooo many times."
The Idolmaster Cinderella Girls,Fuck-a-doodle-doo!
The Idolmaster Cinderella Girls,Derry Girls and Father Ted are Ireland’s contributions to the pantheon of great TV.
The Idolmaster Cinderella Girls,"It's really great, I wish we got more but I'll take it."
The Idolmaster Cinderella Girls,Love it
The Idolmaster Cinderella Girls,I can't believe I just got into this show and now it's over.
The Idolmaster Cinderella Girls,"ETA to correct title of a recommendation 

It’s well written and has a great ensemble cast. They work really well together.  Michelle, Uncle Colm and Sister Michael are my favorites for different reasons 

If you enjoyed it, the same writer wrote London Irish which is pretty funny as well. A few of the same cast show up."
The Idolmaster Cinderella Girls,"I really enjoyed it. But I'd be happy if they never revisit it. It really felt like they had a story that would take three seasons to tell and they told it, which imo is a lot better than just trying to keep making more episodes until it gets shit or people stop watching.   


Having said that I wouldn't complain if they did do more. That episode on the train where they couldn't figure out who the woman is was fucking gold."
The Idolmaster Cinderella Girls,What are ya? Some sort of reverse paedophile?
The Idolmaster Cinderella Girls,I’m a Derry Girl!!!!
The Idolmaster Cinderella Girls,"I went to Catholic H.S. in the late 70's/early 80's in the USA and I feel like I went to school with these girls. 

No bombs, but the nuns and such are pretty accurate."
The Idolmaster Cinderella Girls,"The relationship between Gerry and his FIL is my favourite thing. I love how it balances the lives of teenagers and the importance of the events happening around them, like the announcement of a ceasefire happening when they’re all off celebrating their prom."
The Idolmaster Cinderella Girls,That's all well and good but when does the killer clown show up?
The Idolmaster Cinderella Girls,100%.  it's fantastic.
The Idolmaster Cinderella Girls,Such a great show. Just threw on the first ep on a whim and ended up binging the whole thing.
The Idolmaster Cinderella Girls,"I agree, this show is fantastic. A film would be a great idea!"
The Idolmaster Cinderella Girls,I loved it very much truly heartfelt and hilarious
The Idolmaster Cinderella Girls,Brilliant show. One of those rare gems where every single actor steals every scene they’re in. That’s a rare trick and a treat to watch.
The Idolmaster Cinderella Girls,I just started and it's a treat.
The Idolmaster Cinderella Girls,You aren’t wrong there. I mean the show just has absolutely no misses. Every single episode is at least a 7/10.
The Idolmaster Cinderella Girls,"Also, if you havent seen it, please check out Detectorists. Its another quirky show thats really heart-warming and 'cozy'. I think you'll like it!"
The Idolmaster Cinderella Girls,i’m here for any and all poetic ruminations about this amazing show.
The Idolmaster Cinderella Girls,"Yes to everything you said!

I am not sure I'd call it the best of all time, but it definitely gets  a place in my heart.

I also love to see a show about girls being human. They're not sexualized, they're not afraid to not be sexy and ever-cool. They're just normal humans. We need more shows like that in the US, because teens absolutely model what they see on TV.

I am not part of any Derry Girls discussion groups, so I didn't know James gets a lot of hate. I love him, he's obviously such a sweet guys, even with the mercilesscondemnation for being English. But the jokes about him are hilarious."
The Idolmaster Cinderella Girls,Agreed 100%! When they performed as the Spice Girls I lost it 😂
The Idolmaster Cinderella Girls,"I saw the cast on the Great British Baking Show and thought they had great chemistry, so I decided to watch Derry Girls. I’m almost done but I absolutely love it! The characters are so well written and hilarious. Michelle is definitely my favorite."
The Idolmaster Cinderella Girls,The actresses show up for a Great British Bakeoff Christmas special that's pretty fun too.
The Idolmaster Cinderella Girls,I am orla
The Idolmaster Cinderella Girls,"My favorite episode is the one in S3 with Orla dancing her whole way home. It just cracks me up how in her own world she is, and she creates the little dance numbers."
The Idolmaster Cinderella Girls,"Loved the relationship between Da Gerry and Joe. At first you think Gerry's just a doormat. Then you notice he puts up with the abuse because he loves his wife and daughters that much. Then you realzie he can see right through Joe, and has the respect to allow an old, emotionally-constricted man his dignity."
The Idolmaster Cinderella Girls,[removed]
The Idolmaster Cinderella Girls,"I've said this multiple times and I'm going to say it again because I just do truly mean it - Derry Girls is at the same level as The Office, one of the best shows of all time. Infinitely rewatchable and endlessly funny."
The Idolmaster Cinderella Girls,"Watched it through for the first time a couple of weeks ago, and I fully agree. It has so much heart and so much character. Would have loved more episodes, but that would have prob ruined the magic."
The Idolmaster Cinderella Girls,"I didn't grow up in the 80s/90s Northern Ireland but was born in the 90s and pretty sure I knew a girl who looked nearly identical to Michelle in secondary school. My parents told me stories about growing up during the troubles, Derry girls got it pretty much spot on you just get on with it. The example I love, that my dad told me, is a song written by the Northern Irish punk band Stiff Little Fingers, ""Bloody Sunday"" (released 3 years before U2 song by a similar name) which you think would be about the tragic event but no... It's about how there's nothing to do in Northern Ireland on Sunday! (No shops etc open on Sunday until I think the early 2000s)"
The Idolmaster Cinderella Girls,"Sister Michael is absolutely fantastic, I love her dry responses to everything! 
It really does the nostalgia well. I grew up in the ROI during the 90s and 00s and remember the troubles and the atmosphere even down south was similar to the one up north.

Anyone planning a trip to Derry should go to the free Derry museum to learn about the troubles from a civilian point of view."
The Idolmaster Cinderella Girls,"Wife and I loved it. Not sure who my favorite character is, though. Maybe Uncle Collum?"
The Idolmaster Cinderella Girls,Jeez am I the only one who that it was... Average? Watched season one and thought it was like a juvenile Irish sex education. Hardly a thigh slapper.
The Idolmaster Cinderella Girls,Honestly despise this show. The one girls acting and facial expressions kill me.
The Idolmaster Cinderella Girls,"The last season wasn't as good as the previous ones. The series finale special was bad and the post-credits scene with Chelsea Clinton (yeah, that Chelsea Clinton) was down right embarrassing."
The Idolmaster Cinderella Girls,"schitts creek - derry girls - ted lasso
imo the trifecta of perfect shows with literally nothing wrong with them, incredible writing, hilarious, not strung out etc"
The Idolmaster Cinderella Girls,Season 3 was dog-shit. Felt like a half-hearted 'tie it up and forget about it' move. Season 1 and 2 were awesome though.
The Idolmaster Cinderella Girls,Shame about the new season. I thought all the characters nedflandered.
The Idolmaster Cinderella Girls,alrighty then
The Idolmaster Cinderella Girls,Its great. They really need to make more episodes for a season.
The Idolmaster Cinderella Girls,I thought the last season was a bit Shit but the first two were absolutely excellent
The Idolmaster Cinderella Girls,[deleted]
The Idolmaster Cinderella Girls,"Up to episode 4.  Struggling.

Its not objectionably bad, but basically all the main characters are annoyingly overacted.

I enjoyed then in-betweeners (obvs the most comparable…) and a wide range of other comedic styles but this just isnt doing it for me so far.  The only reason im oressing on is I keep seeing threads like this.

I seear, if I get halfway through aeason 2 and its still just as bad, Im coming for your pickle jars."
The Idolmaster Cinderella Girls,"I just watched it.

Extremely generic, not of one of the best bits of television"
The Idolmaster Cinderella Girls,L
The Idolmaster Cinderella Girls,I was going to try it out but the trailer on Netflix seemed absolutely terrible
The Idolmaster Cinderella Girls,"The trouble with saying what's best about Derry Girls? By the time you're done, you've listed everything about the show."
The Idolmaster Cinderella Girls,"I laughed hard at the pilot, I didn’t laugh like that with the rest of the episodes but it is a good show to watch"
The Idolmaster Cinderella Girls,Is this the girls version of the inbetweeners?
The Idolmaster Cinderella Girls,Love the show. Is there a new season coming out?
Together,Fez and Jackie in that 70’s show
Together,"Haley and Dylan from Modern Family. They dumped the character development on both sides, and focused on making them a young Claire and Phil. I still wish Haley and Andy got together.

Edit: spelling

Edit 2: Glad I’m not the only one who feels this way."
Together,I wouldn't have minded the ending to HIMYM as much if the whole last season wasn't the goddamn wedding and the whole focus on him letting Robin go.
Together,Emma and Spinner on Degrassi. What a choice that was
Together,"Whoever the random, faceless, human man Sookie Stackhouse ends up with at the end of True Blood. Lets erase the entire show's concept of a human in love with a vampire so that she can end up pregnant. 

cool cool cool. Thanks HBO who has no reputation for ruining tv shows with terrible endings ever. /s"
Together,"Any couple where they have one character date multiple people within a friend group in a relatively short time span and everyone still just hangs out like it’s not weird or like it wouldn’t be uncomfortable to do that right away. Treats the character like a plot device, not a person. Just don’t like it.

Jackie and Fez on That 70’s Show is an egregious example."
Together,"Everyone they tried to fix Erin up with on The Office was creepy and weird. She was so childlike it just felt like whoever they put her with was taking advantage of her to varying degrees.

Ellie Kemper played basically the same character on Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt, but they managed to put her in multiple relationships that made sense for her character. (Not counting Jon Hamm who was weird and creepy on purpose)"
Together,Chakotay and seven of nine
Together,"It didn't make me furious, but Reese and Carter from Person of Interest was odd.

Yeah, they had a good working relationship, dare say friends, but there was never a hint of romance."
Together,Can always pretend the cut alternate ending is the real one for HIMYM: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5toL5HmQl8I
Together,In Gilmore Girls- Lane and Zach
Together,"Jaime and Cersei Lannister. The character assassination for Jaime to go back to her after so much development that I was actually rooting for him, and it was made even worse by leaving Brienne like he did. Ugh."
Together,Triple H and Stephanie McMahon...I was 11
Together,House and Cuddy. I didn’t get it Cuddy wasn’t that stupid.
Together,Bran and Westeros
Together,"One of the most annoying tropes in fiction for me is how the male and female leads just ALWAYS have to fall in love. Sometimes it's fine, often it just feels obligatory though.

Which is why one of the things I liked about the show Warehouse 13 was that they didn't put the leads, Pete and Myka, together romantically. There's not even any will-they-won't-they tension. They work together and care about each other, but it's the most brother/sister relationship ever. Across multiple seasons.

Until the final season. Then, literally completely out of nowhere, Pete, in like episode two of the season just ""realizes"" he's in love with Myka. Not even a hint of leadup, just says it in a scene with another character. And then she does the same like an episode or two later and now they're together. It's a great show overall, but man that was some of the most ham-fisted and unnecessary slapping together of characters I've ever seen."
Together,Jaime finding his way back to Cersei at the end
Together,The show Grimm. You're seriously gonna stick the guy with rapey witch lady? Gross.
Together,I’m just happy they didn’t have Jerry and Elaine get back together.
Together,Fez and Jackie on That 70's Show
Together,"Ted and Robin takes the cake. Why build up the mother and make her such a great character and kill her off? Why spend the entire 9th season at Barney and Robin’s wedding if you’re just gonna get them divorced? Why have Ted literally let Robin go only to change it at the end? And the creators knew they likely fucked up, which is why they had the alternate ending where the mother lives."
Together,"Gilmore Girls, those last two seasons were a train wreck, they screwed up Lorelei and Luke and don’t even get me started with the whole Rory and Logan storyline"
Together,"Ezra & Arya.

He was a creep since the pilot"
Together,Piper and Alex from OITNB.
Together,"Not furious, but bewildered:

Mickey and Marsha from Dr. Who.

They have almost no scenes together on the show, they're not even from the same seasons. Yet inexplicably during a season finale montage they're shown as a couple.

I don't want to say it's because they're both black, but it really feels like it's because they're both black."
Together,"That WHOLE season was about Barney and Robin getting married only for Ted to be with her in the last episode definitely annoyed the shit out of me. That’s my pick too, OP."
Together,Kim Wexler and yep guy. I hope it didn't last.
Together,"Chuck and Blair from Gossip Girl. I’m sorry but selling your girlfriend for a hotel then committing domestic violence when she moves on and gets engaged to someone else are two deal breakers for me 💀

Also Dan and Blair were better suited to each other. A witty romcom couple in an otherwise shallow teen soap. The show breaking them up so Blair could marry her pimp and Dan could marry Serena Van Der Snore... that’s my villain origin story 🤦"
Together,"They didn't end up together, but the entire Rachel and Joey relationship from Friends was awful"
Together,You're the Worst.  Lindsey and Paul getting back together made no sense when you actually think about it.
Together,"Tyra and Riggins from Friday Night Lights! Tyra got out of town, went to a good college, and if she came back, it should have been for Landry. Riggs and Lyla should have been end-game."
Together,Willow and not Tara
Together,"Thankfully they didn’t end up together, but all the seasons of back and forth between Andy and Erin on the office made certain episodes unwatchable for me. The second time they tried to force that story line is the absolute lowest point in the show IMO. I know it’s not an endgame couple, but I think they wanted us to believe they would be so it still counts for me."
Together,"Lindsay and Paul on You're the Worst. Lindsay was ludicrously abusive, from infidelity to outright stabbing him and then abandoning him when he was in recovery from said stabbing, but then in the series finale they get remarried and it's supposed to be a happy ending."
Together,"Darlene and Wyatt in Ozark. Made me gag everytime they kissed, but that was probably the point."
Together,Most recent Rachel staying with Shane in The White Lotus
Together,"Oliver and Felicity in ""Arrow"""
Together,Jack and Kate from LOST. The love triangle between them and Sawyer always felt like too much of a distraction for me — and the least interesting part of that show — but the drama between her and Jack got old by the second season. At least Kate and Sawyer had chemistry.
Together,"Aria and Ezra on Pretty Little Liars. Not only did he GROOM her, after she turned 18 no one acted like it was ever a big deal. Grooming wasn't even the only horrible thing he did to her and put her through."
Together,Mindy and Danny in The Mindy Project. I know it was supposed to be a “not-traditionally-beautiful weird girl gets hot guy” scenario but their personalities were so different and there was no way they could be happy without one of them completely changing who they were. She deserved someone who embraced her quirky ness not someone who despised it. Made me so mad.
Together,Laura and Steve from family matters. I loved Myra. They did her dirty. I know she was sick during some of the show. BUt they could have given her a better ending.
Together,Pete and Myka from Warehouse 13. Made no sense and came out of nowhere. The whole series they treated each other as siblings and thier friendshipbbasically written that way. Except for the final season...
Together,"Ted and Robin genuinely ruined the show for me. It went from one of my favorite sitcoms to one I couldn't rewatch because it all rang hollow. Years of telling you Ted and Robin are not good for eachother, building up Barney and Robin, building up the mother only to kill her off in a montage. It just didn't work. The idea could have worked if done better but they butchered the ending and the rest of the show with it."
Together,Michael Vaughan and Lauren Reed in Alias
Together,"Dexter and Debra from Dexter. Just, ew.

Also Daenerys and Jon Snow from Game of Thrones"
Together,Kelly and Dylan on 90210. They were NOT good together
Together,I'll be honest: I didn't buy Barney with Robin either.
Together,lucas and peyton on one tree hill. peyton should've ended up with jake and lucas should've been left on a deserted island away from every woman ever.
Together,"Micky and Martha in **Doctor Who**. It made no sense. They had no screen time together beforehand. Before she was married to a guy she actually had some chemistry with.

Sam Winchester and unknown in **Supernatural**. Why waste time in the final season focusing on Sam and Eileen to do nothing with them at the end? I don't particularly care about Sam and Eileen but the ending just made it pointless.

Korra and Asami in **TLOK**. I know it's an unpopular opinion on this sub for some reason. But they had such terrible development. S1 was the original intended ending with Korra and Mako. That too was terrible. The issue with Korra's love interests (Mako and Asami) is that neither of them really have any personality or proper arcs of their own. They are barely characters.

Megan and Superboy in **Young Justice**. She is toxic and he needs to get out of that relationship.

Ted and Robin in **HIMYM** still remains the worst.

Carolyn and Judah in **Bojack Horseman**. They had a good platonic relationship and the show decided to ruin it. I would have rather her be with Ralph."
Together,breakfast club where they ungothified that chick at the end as if it were a glow up
Together,Ted and Robin x 1000.
Together,The answer is David and Maddy from Moonlight. The show went literally went downhill when they got together
Together,"Travis & Laurie, Cougartown. It just never made any sense to me."
Together,Probably will get burned but most of the characters/coupling in big bang theory. When they couldn’t put appeal just to geek culture they appealed to rom coms.
Together,Hot take? Rachel snd Ross from Friends. That’s toxic as fuck for them to end up together.
Together,"Niles and Daphne didn't make me ""furious"", but them getting together ruined one of the best dynamics of the show imo. Niles wasn't funny anymore after that either.

And they honestly didn't even have that great of a chemistry as a couple as well."
Together,Ross and Rachel. Got over their will-they-won’t-they-yes-they-will-no-they-won’t-will-they-get-back-together schtick way before the final season.
Together,Superboy and Megan during season 2. Him getting back together with him after she was going to mind control him.
Together,"Rick and Michonne - The Walking Dead

It didn't piss me off but I just never saw the chemistry it was just kind of out of nowhere and was REALLY soon after the blonde chick Rick had a crush on had JUST died. I'll probably still watch the spinoff though even if I don't buy the idea that they are some star crossed lovers like Glen and Maggie or Eugene and that Mullet.

The only TV couple that actually makes me angry is Kody and Robyn from Sister Wives. That shits toxic as fuck"
Together,"HIMYM's end was brutal, and I can only imagine it was because they wrote themselves into a corner after season 5.

The ending could have worked, but especially after Barney and Robin's wedding, along with highlighting they didn't work, it just felt cheap.

They also didn't do themselves any favors after proving that Ted is just a toxic piece of shit. It is hard to pinpoint one specific thing because there is a point where he becomes worse than Barney.

Barney at least accepts who he is and acknowledges that a lot of his traits are bad. But he has a code and sticks to it.

Ted, on the other hand, is this constant sliding scale of fuckery that by the end I almost felt bad for the mother as it would be left to her to kick his ass into some relative shape which is not her responsibility as a partner.

The last few seasons had great moments but fuck the story was a shitshow."
Together,Joey and Rachel just showed the writers were out of ideas.
Together,Eric and Donna that 70s show.....all he did was drag her down
Together,"Jim Gordon and Lee Thompkins on Gotham. Absolutely toxic pairing. He couldn’t live up to her standards of morality, so she spent the last 3 seasons of the show mocking him, calling him trash, and actually tried to KILL him multiple times. And yet HE took all the blame for the failure of their relationship. Lee is one of biggest Mary Sues on a TV show I’ve ever seen. So they got married! Lol"
Together,Lizzie McGuire and Gordo. No actual chemistry whatsoever.
Together,Ross and Rachel. They were just an absolute trash couple and the show went downhill for me pretty much as soon as they got together.
Together,"The Butler and the mean blonde lady from the Nanny (I haven’t watched the Nanny in years so names escape me)

But the entire series, has been nothing but them snarking at each other, at best, a friendly snark, but we never got any hint that they had feelings for one another"
Together,Was gonna say Ted and Robin but you beat me to it. Makes the show hard to rewatch
Together,Katara had palpable chemistry with Zuko and none with Ang. All I’m saying.
Together,Bobby and Janice
Together,"As of now, the couple referred to as “Chenford” on *The Rookie*, Nathan Fillion’s police drama on ABC.


He (Sergeant Tim Bradford) started the series as her (Officer Lucy Chen’s) training officer. Directly responsible for shaping her career, and capable of ending it in a snap. He’s now in her direct line of supervision, still capable of ending her career on a whim.


The power imbalance there is astronomical. 


The show is still ongoing and I am holding out hope that the writers will come to their senses and split them up but as of right now, the coupling really does annoy me."
Together,Rafaella and Seven of Nine in Picard. Absolutely zero chemistry between them other than arguing for the entire season and suddenly they're snogging at the end? Never seen a more blatant attempt at box-ticking.
Together,Dwight and Angela from the Office. I preferred if he would've stayed with the farm chick
Together,Oliver Queen and Felicity Smoak in Arrow. Especially when they killed off Laurel to make it happen.
Together,Emma Swan and Captain Hook from Once Upon a Time.
Together,Flavor flav…just that
Together,"Louis & Sheila on Suits… he deserves to be happy, but I thought Sheila was wrong for him"
Together,"I forgot their names, but the detectives on The Killing.  What a misread on their arc that last season was."
Together,"Spoilers obviously (and a hot take potentially), but Kira and Odo in Deep Space 9. They keep hinting at it the whole show, and even I was cheering for them…but after Odo left Rom to get caught because he’s was too busy fucking the other shapeshifter, I really turned on Odo as a character. Like he doesn’t even really have to earn it back either, he just helps them at the end and it’s washed away. WHICH makes Kira and Odo’s romance feel forced at the end - Kira could barely forgive her own mother for being a collaborator, and she’s cool with Odo? It was just one of my least favorite parts of the show.

Rom and Leeta though? A+. Lovable Rom has turnaround and ends up marrying the smoking hot dabo girl? Fuck yeah!"
Together,Longmire and Starbuck. Just no.
Together,7 of 9 ending up with Raffi in Star Trek Picard is probably something that kinda annoyed me.
Together,Oliver Queen and Felicity Smoak. Absolutely 0 chemistry as a couple.
Together,Mulder and Scully. The show was at its best in the early days when they were professionals hunting monsters and weird shit. Was a relief they were no longer together by the time the second movie and revival rolled around.
Together,"Rebecca and Sam on Ted Lasso. I just don’t get it, they make it clear that Rebecca doesn’t want to be alone and presumably that means she wants a husband she can grow old with. Dating a 21 year isn’t going to last no matter which way you look at it."
Together,Buffy and Spike
Together,"This one’s a bit of a twist on the topic, but I was mad when Dexter and Lumen just completely fell out after one season. They were working together for like 8 episodes, their relationship developed and they eventually fell in love, then they were only a couple for like two episodes and then out of no where they just wrote her off at the end of season 5. What’s tragic is that, in my opinion, she was probably the best fit for him as a partner because she went through a traumatic life changing experience, felt the same urges to kill, and he was allowed to be open with her. It was a match made in Heaven, or Hell depending on how you look at it. A lot of second half Dexter just triggered me in general…"
Together,"Honest JD and Elliot in Scrubs. I thought it was a way better ending that both grew as people and recognized a friendship made more sense.

Kinda similar with Fry and Leela. This idea that dude should just keep trying despite obvious disinterest for years isn't a healthy message to reinforce."
Together,"Worf and any regular character in any show.

It always seemed forced.

Troi and Riker worked because their characters had already done it, and that's always more interesting.  Another example is Steed and Peel.  The characters didn't do it, but the actors were instructed to relate to each other as if they had, and their chemistry was off the chart."
Together,"Damon and Elena.

>!He murdered so much of her family and assaulted her friend and they still ended up together!<"
Together,Bones and the cop man from bones. I just hated it
Together,I’m probably alone on this but Alisha and Simon in Misfits. This and the time travel were enough to make me give up on the show.
Together,"Furious is too far, but Jeff and Annie in Community was really forced at the end"
Together,"cassie and nate, iykyk"
Together,Martha and Mickey from Dr Who. It seems lazy.
Together,Troy and Britta.
Together,"Adora and Catra. We spent basically the whole series watching Catra do terrible terrible things to Adora under the guise that she’s She Ra and that’s the problem, but that doesn’t matter because Catra still has a lot of resentment for Adora herself. Catra doesn’t do anything to show she deserves Adora. If anything it would have been better if she had ended up with Scorpia but even that would have been a stretch."
Together,"Pam and Jim. Karen was so much better for Jim, I'll die on that hill."
Together,"I’m gonna say it… Chandler and Monica. 

She loves him, but she doesn’t like him. Never did. People forget she once said she would still be lukewarm on getting together with him even if he were the last man on earth. 

You can tell she’s super insecure about her relationship every time someone gives her shit for being with him. I feel like even near the end she was always comparing him to Richard in her mind. 

Say what you will about Janice, but you could tell she really loved him, even though she cheated on him. Chandler’s always deserved better."
Together,"JD and Elliot from Scrubs. Ruined the finale for me (of the actual show, completely ignoring the spinoff season nobody counts anyways). They had stuck the characters together like 4 or 5 times in the past and it always went horribly immediately, JD was the problem and he never showed an iota of actual growth in the relationship department."
Together,Sasuke and Sakura. She should have ended up with Rock Lee.
Together,"Dwight and Angela.

Angela didn't deserve a happy ending, and she was also just a bad character imo.

Dwight also has better compatibility with at least 1 or 2 of his other partners.

Also Plop and Erin.  Not that Erin should've gotten back with Andy, but Plop was useless."
Zumbos Just Desserts,I’m speechless. I’m without speech
Zumbos Just Desserts,"I find it to still be extremely funny. My gf watched it for the first time a few months ago and loved it.

The characters are supposed to be dicks. That's pretty obvious."
Zumbos Just Desserts,Lol. If you didn't know they were dicks from day one then I have to question your judgment
Zumbos Just Desserts,"Show that aged badly: still playing twice a night in local syndication where I am, right after the local news on the strongest independent station. It left first-run 15 years or more before all of the other shows that fill these kind of slots."
Zumbos Just Desserts,"Seinfeld hasn't aged badly, your tastes and motivations have changed."
Zumbos Just Desserts,"I suggest you stay far, far away from *Curb Your Enthusiasm* if Seinfeld offends you."
Zumbos Just Desserts,#SERENITY NOW
Zumbos Just Desserts,You're trying to make a 90s American show about modern American politics...and you're not even American? Does that strike you as odd in any way?
Zumbos Just Desserts,"Nope. A timeless classic.
It's in my list, along with Fawlty, Black Adder, Ad Fab, Cheers... And several others."
Zumbos Just Desserts,"> Worst of all it's so much more apparent now to me what dicks they all are which makes it so not funny for me to watch. Because (until the last episode) unlike iasip they never get their just desserts for their dickishness. 

What makes you say this? 

There are many episodes where they get hit with things long before the end...

* George gets arrested over stealing medicine because he felt he was given the wrong change
* Jerry overstays at the party and the guy who he said can come by gets a hooker, which Jerry is arrested for
* Playnow does a number of things against George to make him break his contract after pretending to be handicapped
* When George parks in the handicapped spot the car gets damaged and the big screen TV they bought for the Drake goes to the woman who got the faulty wheelchair that they cheaped out on
* Etc

> It's just cringe to watch and so many things jerry talks about aren't relevant at all anymore.

It also depends on what exactly you look at. A lot of Seinfeld still works, simply because it more character based than political.

> that's nearly 100% white hetero, how is that possible to defend?

There is also a fair amount, but I'd argue it doesn't make a difference. Being X doesn't impact 99.99 percent of the situations or how characters act, so it would purely be for the sake of it."
Zumbos Just Desserts,"Wow, it's super crazy that friend groups might be made up of the same ethnicity! I'm trying to wrap my head around that, man!"
Zumbos Just Desserts,People harping on about how badly something has aged has aged badly.
Zumbos Just Desserts,"I bet you also ""just can't get into The Wire"" because ""they use pagers and pay phones""."
Zumbos Just Desserts,">so many things jerry talks about aren't relevant at all anymore

No shit. It's from 30 years ago.

>apparent now to me what dicks they all are

Then you weren't paying attention before.

>Seinfeld somehow imagined a nyc in the 1990s, that's nearly 100% white hetero

Insert basically every sitcom of the time and this statement is still true.

You've basically said ""Hey everyone! I've just now realized that Seinfeld is a sitcom from the 90s about a group of friends who are kind of dicks!"" but in many, many more words."
Zumbos Just Desserts,"Just wait til you get to the episode in which Kramer does brown face, or when he dresses up like a pimp and tries to speak in jive while interrupting two people getting it on in a car. But also years later 30 Rock had Jane Krakowski in black face and Alec Baldwin in brown face."
Zumbos Just Desserts,Making something out of *nothing*
Zumbos Just Desserts,i still think it's really funny and i've watched each season/each episode dozens of times.   but to each his/her own.
Zumbos Just Desserts,"Could not disagree more. I’ve been rewatching it and have been very surprised at how much is still very relevant today, because when it comes down to it it’s a show about the minutia of daily life and relationships. Of course, I’m approximately the same age now as Jerry was in the show. 

For a show taking place before the internet and cell phones, I find myself referencing things in the show and how they relate to something in my daily life quite often. I think I’ve said, “I just saw something very similar on Seinfeld” about 6 different times in the past two weeks.

And the characters were always dicks. It was played for comedy how selfish and inconsiderate they were. Like the one episode with Bizarro Jerry where everyone in Elaine’s new friend group was the opposite of her friends and therefore reliable, kind, polite, giving, etc."
Zumbos Just Desserts,"Hmmm. I've been rewatching it on Netflix and marveling how well it's aged. Many episodes still feel cutting edge. Can't say that about any other show back then. Other shows like Cheers are still fun to watch, but they no longer feel modern. Worst thing about Seinfeld is the godawful laugh track. I know some of the laughter is live, but they've sweetened it way past the point of credibility."
Zumbos Just Desserts,I'm watching it for the first time and loving it
Zumbos Just Desserts,This is your brain on woke bullshit
Zumbos Just Desserts,Nah.  Next!
Zumbos Just Desserts,"I think many people today are too concerned with likeability in fictional characters. It's shallow and even narcissistic (""I can't relate to assholes"" as if characters being likeable is something you can only relate to because you think **you** are likeable)"
Zumbos Just Desserts,"Still one of my favorites, you're crazy!"
Zumbos Just Desserts,I could well be wrong but I don’t think there were many racially diverse sitcoms back then. There were shows with white casts and shows with black casts. And vanishingly few shows with queer characters.
Zumbos Just Desserts,Is this a copypasta?
Zumbos Just Desserts,You missed the core theme of the show. THESE ARE NOT GOOD PEOPLE. Jerry Seinfeld literally has stated these characters are self centered people who wreck everyone's life who deals with them. That's why the show ended the way it did.
Zumbos Just Desserts,"It seems like you have completely misinterpreted Seinfeld. I don't want to be one of those people that says, ""You just didn't get it."" But I really think that's the case for you regarding the show. All the points you bring up kinda show me you just don't understand it.

Although the whiteness of Seinfeld is a big problem with it. It's pretty embarrassing that there are basically no black people in the show. So I'll give you points on that. But your other complaints just kinda show me you don't understand the show."
Zumbos Just Desserts,"Don't ever watch anything from the '50s - '70s, you'll be struck mute with horror."
Zumbos Just Desserts,"I still think it’s very, very funny. The homophobia is more pronounced and problematic than I recall, but it’s never too malicious either. Mostly it’s just Jerry and George being overwhelmingly concerned about ever being perceived as gay.  Other than that?  Timelessly funny imo"
Zumbos Just Desserts,"I was a kid in the 90s, so I didn’t watch Seinfeld then, but I did in later years and have always found it funny. However, if I didn’t live in the 90s, I’m not sure I could relate to it. A lot of the comedy relies on technological and logistical snafus that just don’t happen anymore. So I wouldn’t say that it has aged poorly, but it is very much a product of its time."
Zumbos Just Desserts,"The whole joke is that they're assholes, it's a shitty joke."
Zumbos Just Desserts,"I'm genuinely surprised this apparently one of the more unpopular opinions i hold, haha."
Zumbos Just Desserts,"the first two or three seasons are a struggle, but i think it still holds up pretty well.

biggest problem is the aspect ratio on Netflix being wrong"
Zumbos Just Desserts,You start at season 1 and go to season 3?
Zumbos Just Desserts,"Ahhh, here we go again, let's cancel Seinfeld.... /s"
Zumbos Just Desserts,"I find it quite funny, and the fact it's not all about modern identity politics is not a problem for me."
Zumbos Just Desserts,It makes me feel real good (and old) that a main character being Jewish and having the name Seinfeld is not considered diverse casting anymore.
Zumbos Just Desserts,not that there's anything wrong with that
Zumbos Just Desserts,"""It's just cringe to watch and so many things jerry talks about aren't relevant at all anymore.""

Funny, I watched the complete series this year for the first time ever and thought exact the opposite. They picked the topics so well that they're timeless, I have recognized todays society in almost every single episode, and the humor is so refreshing and unique it stands out from what's avaiable today by far."
Zumbos Just Desserts,I’m astounded you think friends was “vastly more diverse” when there’s multiple websites literally counting the amount because it was that few. Clearly you have a terrible memory of both shows lmfao.
Zumbos Just Desserts,"Funny i feel the same.. I watch it now and I'm thinking the same, ""they're such d*'s.. Why am i watching this"".. I can quote episodes.. I used to watch it every half hour in syndication.."
Zumbos Just Desserts,I pictured George saying this. With his expressions and hand movements.
Zumbos Just Desserts,"Why does it need to be so contemporary for you to appreciate it? It’s a product of it’s time, like many great works of art. Does everyone have to have a smart phone and Uber eats in every novel you’ve read as well? Seinfeld is still very sharply written, and I can’t think of a single sitcom that even comes close to matching the character work and joke writing  in Seinfeld, so what else are you even comparing it to?"
Zumbos Just Desserts,"the first 3 seasons were never that good, it only picks up steam after that

edit: funny I'm getting downvoted since it's one of my favorite tv shows of all time.  I'll rephrase and say it's not they are ""bad"" it's just the show doesn't really find itself until season3/4 and after.  season 3 is when the OP quit watching so they gave up too soon"
Zumbos Just Desserts,American politics has infected the rest of the world via the Internet unfortunately.
Zumbos Just Desserts,"Yeah, because there's no way that American politics have adverse effects on the rest of the world, it's absolute bullshit if anyone not American comments on this glorious nation🙄"
Zumbos Just Desserts,"To a degree yeah. From a political view it was really a conservative show, which many of the other sitcoms of the day weren't, even shows like tool time or married with children."
Zumbos Just Desserts,"For impact, you can keep a tab of how much Jerry has lost by being friends with these losers. Tens of thousands."
Zumbos Just Desserts,"And the show was at least self aware of its lack of diversity, like the episode where George tried to make black friends to prove he’s not racist but the best he can come up with is the family he once intruded upon when they rented the movie he needed to watch."
Zumbos Just Desserts,Here's the lost episode https://youtu.be/6dXBC6R_rxk
Zumbos Just Desserts,"In my opinion, Seinfeld is one of, if not the only show to get away with a laugh track. I'm usually laughing so uncontrollably hard that the laugh track gives me time to recuperate. Watching curb your enthusiasm I sometimes have to pause the episode to laugh so I don't miss anything, and I still have to pause Seinfeld from time to time I'm laughing to hard.

Would a non-laugh track Seinfeld have been better? Of course, but Seinfeld is really the only show I'll watch with a laugh track."
Zumbos Just Desserts,"The laugh track. That's so odd to me. I never really noticed laugh tracks, but now I actively have to train myself to ignore the laugh track when I watch an older sitcom."
Zumbos Just Desserts,[which one is OP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5BxjUmzPPA)
Zumbos Just Desserts,Lol it should be now. OP is a softie
Zumbos Just Desserts,"No the whole joke is that yes they are assholes but they are also regularly misunderstood by judgemental,  unforgiving and overly sensitive assholes on the other side."
Zumbos Just Desserts,You seem like you're trying a little too hard to fit in... I wouldn't judge the US by anything you see on Reddit - especially the large subs.
Zumbos Just Desserts,I'm without speech Jerry! I'm losing it!
Zumbos Just Desserts,"I can watch All in the family, Jack Benny (1950), even 50 year old Star Trek TOS is watchable, given Kirk's inappropriateness sometimes, but nothing close to Seinfeld cringe..
I still watch ST:TOS, and i accept its a different era.. But Seinfeld is hard to watch.. Their jerkiness is annoying.. Like how Friends used to annoy me.. Never liked Friends..
I used to be able to quote Seinfeld, like most people, and watched it every half hour in syndication.. Had it as my ring tone ages ago.."
Zumbos Just Desserts,Wait.. Are you saying Seinfeld was more conservative than Tool Time?
Zumbos Just Desserts,Dude. Just stop. You are saying really stupid things.  This is stupendously incorrect.
Zumbos Just Desserts,It was the 90s. It was pretty contemporary for its time.
Zumbos Just Desserts,"> Tens of thousands.

He lost over $2,000 because George crashed the rental car alone. Hard to calculate the exact amount, given George **did** pay for lunch."
Zumbos Just Desserts,"So a show about a bunch of assholes that are assholes in different ways, so entertaining🙄"
Zumbos Just Desserts,"You are talking about a completely different issue. There's nothing dated about their ""jerkiness"", it's just not to your taste anymore for whatever reason. I don't have that problem. For most fans, that's a huge part of the appeal, and there are plenty of newer comedy series in which the lead or lead characters are jerks."
Zumbos Just Desserts,Bahahahahjahaahaha
Zumbos Just Desserts,"I do, it at least showed (some) working class people in positive roles."
Zumbos Just Desserts,">George did pay for lunch

It was a BIG salad. She just HAD to get the BIG salad Jerry."
Zumbos Just Desserts,"Yep it is, it wouldnt be as popular as it is if it wasnt."
Zumbos Just Desserts,"I'm pretty sure we're saying the same thing.. It was an appeal when i was young.. They're finale focused on it.. And it was great.. But it's definitely hard to rewatch, at least for me, and for many others based on the fact that others mention it as well."
Zumbos Just Desserts,Bro it's a sitcom Jesus Christ
Zumbos Just Desserts,[deleted]
Zumbos Just Desserts,"Home Improvement was definitely the more conservative of the two.

Seinfeld actually gave validity to same sex couples and even had a smart approach to the pro-life/pro-choice debate."
Zumbos Just Desserts,"I get teenagers and children laughing at people just being dicks to each other. If you think it's funny as an adult I guess that is your right, but you do have my deepest condolences🙏"
Zumbos Just Desserts,"I dont think that being younger or older has anything to do with it. Your tastes changed. That's it. They didn't get better in some fundamental way, just different. The show is still beloved by people of all ages, and  I would contend that most people don't have any trouble rewatching it, and that their jerkiness is still q huge part of the appeal."
Zumbos Just Desserts,A “show within a show”. Tool Time was the name of the local television show the main character in the actual sitcom “Home Improvement” starred in for his job on the show. *this Reddit comment was brought to you by Binford Tools
Zumbos Just Desserts,Home Improvement - Tim Allen show. I don’t remember the show itself being too political though but I was a kid the
Zumbos Just Desserts,"Oh geez, this may come as a shock to you but everyone is a dick from time to time and a huge part of the shows appeal is that the audience can relate to a lot of the asshole behaviour the main characters engage in. In real life, people are often selfish, shallow and offensive. The show wouldnt work if the audience couldnt relate to the characters at all.

Unlike other shows the characters arent filtered through some PC machine. People like the show because the characters are flawed and unfiltered."
Zumbos Just Desserts,Lol.. I didn't say it's because I was younger.. I said when i was younger.
Zumbos Just Desserts,"Oh geez, this may come as a shock to you, but most people actually feel bad about being an asshole. All your comment has shown me is that you yourself are a dick, and you don't have any standards for the people you surround yourself with."
Zumbos Just Desserts,"You do realise the show pokes fun at their behaviour to the point they end up in jail but whatever continue with your fake outrage

Also if youre gonna get on the high horse, try not calling people dicks just because they enjoy watching a tv show."
Zumbos Just Desserts,"Never said you were a dick because you like a show, I called you a dick because you said, ""everyone's a dick from time to time"", basically trying to normalize shitty behavior. I hold myself and my friends to a higher standard than that. Your maturity or lack thereof doesn't have a bearing on if your a good person or not, obviously."
Zumbos Just Desserts,"But Everyone IS a dick from time to time because noone is perfect all the time. Its not normalising shitty behaviour to say so.  Its just a statement about a  fact of life. 

You being condescending on a forum offering your ""deepest condolences"" to any adult that enjoys the show is a perfect example. Its actually a very Jerry thing to say. It reminds me of the seinfeld episode where Jerry contemplates dumping a girlfriend because she likes a commercial he hates. He suddenly thinks less of her because she finds it entertaining."
Zumbos Just Desserts,Is Christine McConnell the lady who used to get to the front page of Reddit with her interesting Halloween pics every year? She almost had a Tim Burton kind of vibe I think.
Zumbos Just Desserts,She reminds me of the engineers from Prometheus and Alien.
Zumbos Just Desserts,"My gf and I put on this show on a whim the other night and ended up binging the entire thing!  We honestly could not stop laughing throughout the entire series- Wendy is a nonstop laugh riot. 

It’s crazy this came out cause just the other day I was thinking about being younger and watching the Martha Stewart Halloween specials this time every year. Christine’s crafts are just so delectably devilish and I can’t wait to try to make my own eyeball chocolate chip cookies "
Zumbos Just Desserts,There's a lot of great Halloween and baking ideas however it's like /r/restofthefuckingowl the show.  The real let down is half the process of creating is not even shown. While I admire the concept of having Muppets and skits written in between it could have used better editing and tighter writing. And valuable time is sacrificed in favor of the Muppet's screen time / one word commentary.

Zumbos Just Desserts,Rated PG. Has puppets. 3 year old loves spooky stuff cuz her birthday is 2 days before halloween. Figured this would be a homerun. Kid loved it. Wife made me turn it off when they had the neighbor ball gagged talking about doing weird shit to his nipples. Hoping someone thats seen it all can tell me if it gets more inappropriate than that so I can try to convince the wife to give it another go. Kiddo was obsessed with the baking and the mummy cat.
Zumbos Just Desserts,"At first I was confused at why the crazy right wing religious lady from Politically Incorrect had a Halloween show. 

But that’s Christine O’Donnell. Then I was disappointed that it wasn’t actually her. But you guys are making it sound fun anyway!

Zumbos Just Desserts,"She's very creative and Reddit used to love her, but her ""acting"" is terrible."
Zumbos Just Desserts,"I adore Christine and her wonderful creative world. Watching her make anything is soothing, almost hypnotic. My only little thing with the show is the Rose character. It was mentioned that Christine found her and revived her using pieces of other roadkills. Since everything she makes is utter perfection, how is Rose so imperfect, with like a hand made of a crooked fork? And the character’s voice annoys me. But the other beasts are perfect. I loooove the show and I wish we could get every big holidays made in Christine’s mesmerizing kitchen!"

Also, the clothes are gorgeous.  I'm assuming vintage.  

And as for the actual show, it's like Wednesday Addam's hot perfectionist cousin grew up and had a cooking show... With a plot.  I love it.  It's like nothing I've ever seen before.  I hope you get many seasons!!  So great!!!"

Zumbos Just Desserts,"Oh yes! I read somewhere here about the show and got curious. Obviously I never heard about Christine McConnell before.  Well, I wanted to take a short peak into the first episode - and guess what: I binged all episodes right away! So fantastic and funny and creative! Really amazing. I hope there are many more seasons to come."

Argon,"I don't think many people watch the Korean shows, there are some like 'Stranger' (Forest of Secrets) that are decent dramas albeit with some cultural quirks that can take a bit of getting used to at first but there are so many rubbish ones that don't have the same production quality. Most are more akin to tele-novelas and daytime soaps so it puts people off.

I liked Stranger so will probably give this one a try eventually."

Argon,It was Netflix i watched it on but i'm in the UK. The catalogue sites say it was also added to Netflix US on the 1st November so if you haven't checked recently it might be there now.
Black,"It's been said a couple times but season 1 is a bit rough IMO. It is one of those shows that you're not too sure what is going and they compensate with uber violence and nudity. I'm not against that kind of jazz, it just is almost a calling card of low budget/one seasons shows. I would still say it'd be a 7 with seasons 2+ being 9s. I'm just a regular folk who likes tropical settings and pirates, so take it as that.

Seasons 2 + is some of my favorite TV show watching ever. They really got into their groove. Incredible personalities, tons of onscreen chemistry between characters that you get from working together for some time, enough twists and turns and even a solid ending. It is one of the few shows that I've ever actually said out loud with no one else around ""Oh they should not have done that"".

Very glad I stuck with the show.

\*Remember fruit is fruit."
Black,Yes.  It takes a few episodes IIRC for the plot to reveal a little more.
Black,"I remember watching the first couple episodes (can't remember how many) and thought it's bad and I should not continue.

I did continue and it turned into an absolute brilliant show after a very weak beginning, at least for me."
Black,"Season 1 is good, seasons 2-4 are damn near perfect tv. Season two’s season finale is probably my all time favorite episode of tv ever."
Black,"First season is good, but you can tell they were confined by a budget for an unproven commodity. Season 2 when they were able to get onto the ocean more was just awesome"
Black,Black Sails is one of very few i rated 10/10.
Black,"It’s so damn good, it starts out kind of slow with world building but seasons 2 and 3 are some of my personal favorite seasons of television. Excellent acting performances from Toby Stevens and Luke Arnold."
Black,It is a perfect show. It would’ve been a Top 5 show of all time if it was on HBO.
Black,"Black Sails is great!  Like others have said, it takes a bit to get rolling, but I was hooked from the first episode.  There's a mix of history loosely based in fact, a bit of legend, and a lot borrowed from Treasure Island.  

Most of the key characters are at least somewhat true to their backstories, be they historically accurate or based on their exaggerated exploits.

Keep Wikipedia open and check out some of the main character's entries.  

All that said, I was so happy when they introduced Rackham.  The only pirate to ever sail with a female first mate (Anne Bonny).  I've got a Rackham styled Jolly Roger because I thought he was one of the more interesting figures from the age of piracy.  You'll probably recognize it as one of the more common Roger's.  Oddly enough, you don't see a lot of iterations of Blackbeard's flag, even though he was one of the more feared pirates, and one with a much juicier legend."
Black,"Black Sails, Spartacus, and Turn are all insane shows not enough people have watched"
Black,One of my favorites of all time and I've seen most of the great ones.
Black,It's one of the all time greats. This reminded me I need to do a rewatch! Also one of the greatest opening themes of all time.
Black,"Yes. It ties up nicely to treasure Island and also have a satisfying ending. Probably the best pirate show around, not that there are many."
Black,"Such an unexpected Gem. I started season 2, and have actually never gone back through season 1, I heard it was a bit rough as the show took a moment to find it's footing, but 2+ is just a fun, dramatic, memorable ride - especially if you're already familiar withTreasure Island. And it ends so beautifully"
Black,Such a great show
Black,It's a fantastic show that constantly improves. One of my all time favorites.
Black,"great show

just know they spent all the budget on building the sets and ships (which are great) and costumes so all the action is in the first and last episode of season 1, but season 2 onwards a lot more happens because the budget goes further."
Black,I’d put it on just for the opening credit alone
Black,One of the very best
Black,Absolutely!! I miss it so much. Had so much fun watching it back in 2014/2015 :(
Black,"A very good show, up there with the best"
Black,"It's great. Violent and compelling with some great acting sprinkled in.

Also, I know a girl who likes to recite drunken impassioned Captain Flint speeches and it's incredibly hot."
Black,"Fuck yes.

Also I never skip the intro."
Black,"It's one of my all-time faves. It starts slow, but picks up after 4 episodes or so."
Black,"I liked it, and it has a sick intro."
Black,"I tried 3 times to watch it and I don't think I got past episode 5 or 6 at the most.

It just doesn't look and feel right. It feels like a soap.

The actors are too beautiful, everyone looks perfect. Nothing like how pirates and pirate life was in real life.

It's a soap opera for people who want to watch perfect looking people in an easy to digest format.

If you're looking for a gritty, true-to-life depiction of pirates this ain't it."
Black,Yes.
Black,It's amazing. On par with stuff like Mad Men and ^((early))  Game of Thrones
Black,It's very good imo but it might take a few episodes to get going.
Black,Season 1 is slow but the pay off is worth it. Seasons 2-4 are some of the best I’ve ever seen in television
Black,It is good. Give it a whirl.
Black,Yep.
Black,"Season 1- string character building , so push room.  It becomes epic !! Rewatched 3 times already."
Black,Yes. The first episode is great. The next few episodes are slow and tedious but important for the overall plot. After those few episodes it picks back up and never stops being great.
Black,Unbelievably fantastic
Black,It's an HBO tier show on Starz. Really fantastic show all around except for maybe the very start.
Black,"Im in the same boat OP, heard great things but couldn't make it through the first episode before tapping out."
Black,"Nah, its a great show. Starts a little slow, disjointed, but man... its fucking phenomal."
Black,"It’s one of my favourite Tv series’ of all time, so yes."
Black,"One of my all time favorites, it’s especially good if you like pirate history and treasure island"
Black,"It's a great show. It does start slow, but season 2 is straight fire from beginning to end. 3 and 4 are very good too."
Black,"To echo what others have said, S1 takes a while to get going. On my first watch, I struggled with the first 3-4 eps and gave up. When I returned to it, the first season does improve in the back half. But S2 and 3 have a noticeable jump in quality and the story really gets going. I found S4 to not be as good as the previous 2 seasons, but it was still a satisfying conclusion."
Black,"One of my favorite shows, so so good."
Black,Yes
Black,"Good? No.

It's phenomenal."
Black,Imagine GoT with pirates instead of dragons and with an amazing final season. That's Black Sails.
Black,We loved it.
Black,It’s great. There are scenes that have stayed with me years and years later which to me is the biggest test.
Black,"One of the best ever made 

We dont see that too often recently, we are bombarded by poor quality shows with jacked reviews from probably fake people or bots.

Black sails is the real deal"
Black,"Phenomenal. But the first season is easily the weakest. In fact, each season is better than the previous one. What I’m saying is, keep going if you don’t like the initial episodes."
Black,"It has some really great moments, as well as meh moments. But there is not a whole lot like it around, definitely worth a watch. Great intro!"
Black,It is incredible
Black,At least for myself I thought it was a show which consistently improved over time.
Black,"It's a fantastic show, definitely worth watching."
Black,the first season is definitely the weakest but it ends strongly and only goes up from there. One of my favorite shows of all time.
Black,"OP as everyone says, just struggle through the first few episodes. I watched Black Sails when it came out and I was almost not gonna go back after the first season but my oh my was I glad I did. The mark up in quality is massive after Season 1, 2-4 is sublime television,  great characters great visuals for the budget they had too. Immense show and among my top 5 of all time!"
Black,"Yeah its sick. Just watch it. The show ends nicely too. It really picks up in drama at the end of the 2nd season. 

Also the way they use the budget is incredible. The show stars no famous stars and the visuals and production value punch above their weight."
Black,"If you have thick enough skin to get through the first few dreadful episodes, it’s a wonderfully entertaining series."
Black,"Its very popular, but it was a weird mixed bag for me. 

The performances are excellent and the characters are interesting. The story, however, takes very long to get anywhere and the pacing moves in fits and starts. I’d still watch it just for the performances, though."
Black,I’ve just finished season 2 and I’m enjoying it. There are a few things I don’t like about it but overall it’s worth your time.
Black,It's fantastic. Give it 3 episodes at least. It takes a minute to develop but it's great.
Black,One of my favorites. Hang in there.
Black,Oh ya that show was awesome
Black,We binged it thru the pandemic lockdown. It was incredible.
Black,If Black Beard in episode 1 didn't get your attention then nothing will.
Black,"I love seeing this show get its flowers. For so long, it’s felt like my wife and I were the only ones who watched it."
Black,"Fantastic show. It can feel like a slow start for a lot of people (I love it), because season one focuses on a lot of world and character building ahead of adventure.

It's a show that got its desired run and ended on its own terms as well."
Black,"I liked parts of it and some of the characters.  I'm a fan of pirates though.

The opening title sequence is really badass.  Of course, that's what you can expect from Bear McCreary.

It aired on Starz, so it's pretty gritty, so it's got that going for it."
Black,Yep yep yep.
Black,"Ahoy hoy, many many pirate hooker boobs are to be found here matey"
Black,So so so so so SO good. Check it out!!!
Black,"Yes. It's one of my favourite shows. The characters are great and the action is awesome. It's a fully complete story with only 4 seasons. 

The first season is a bit slow paced since it's just taking it's time to build the setting. I think that's what most people complain about though I enjoyed the first season. 

Just keep going. I think most people loved season 2 onwards even if they didn't like slower pacing in season 1."
Black,On top with spartacus
Black,"Yes, I loved that one."
Black,"Yes, best live action pirate series out there. I remember when I first watched it, I couldn’t help but compare it to GoT quality wise."
Black,"Yes, I strongly recommend it!"
Black,"I think it's one of the best shows of the last decade. I 's a show that ends, one where the creators thought about teh ending and make it mean something. After the ending you can pick up the book and read it and even enjoy it more!"
Black,A lot of gratuitous sex in the first season but picks up into a real fun show
Black,Best complete normal tv show I’ve ever watched
Black,One of the season finales (I think season 3) is still one of my favorite episodes of TV ever.
Black,"Along with Rome it's on my top 2 TV shows ever.

Season 4, episode 3 included one of the most upsetting scenes I've ever experienced.

Its pacing and revelation was absolutely magnificent."
Black,"It is a great show!  
If you love pirates there is nothing that compares to it."
Black,Yes it’s great
Black,"Get through season one. 

The rest of the show is incredible."
Black,It's great. Probably the best pirate themed content of the last decades.
Black,"Amazing show, especially after the first couple of episodes."
Black,"if the show was on the air now, it would have critical acclaim....if you know how it ends you know why."
Black,"Yes, a very good one!!. Unexpected twists."
Black,"Great show. Finished it last year. The ending for a major character story arc is not quite what you’d expect but it’s very satisfying in context of the show and makes a ton of sense looking backwards. 

As others have said season 2 and on are amazing. Captain Flynn is a great character. The actor does really well with him and makes him very memorable."
Black,It’s one of the few shows that actually keeps getting better as it goes on.
Black,I really loved it.
Black,"I just recently started watching the show and I enjoyed the pilot but found the next 3-4 episodes to be slow. Not bad, just slow. A lot of talking and not a lot of pirate stuff.

The end of S1 picks up and S2 (especially the end of S2) was really fun to watch and I'm fully invested now. I recommend it."
Black,"It’s my all time favorite show and a masterpiece.

I actually don’t think the first season is as bad as everyone is saying it is. And it sets up basically everything that comes later. Some parts, like the Eleanor intro, are cringe, and some storylines are forgotten later because they weren’t good, but you have to really internalize every single thing the characters say because 90% of it is critical to the overall themes and arcs of the show.

Especially listen to every single word that comes out of Flint’s mouth. But really rewatching the first season will blow your mind with how much of it went completely over your head."
Black,"It has some interesting characters in the first season that they never fleshed out to my satisfaction, and instead stuck with the brooding Captain Flint whose sexual orientation they flip in season 2. The show is mostly boring."
Black,"God-tier show. Criminally underrated. One of the best and most satisfying endings of all time, especially if you're familiar with Treasure Island."
Black,"Definitely worth the watch. It never got the hype it deserved because

1) It aired on Starz, which doesnt have nearly as many subscribers as other networks.

2) It aired in the same years as GoT which was getting all the attention."
Black,"Mixed. I watched it a while ago, and some of it is cool and interesting while a lot of it just drags out forever and is clearly filler. There's definitely good parts in there, but it's not a masterpiece by far."
Black,"Fine I’ll say it, boobs!"
Black,YESSS. I a 30 year old man cry every time I watch the last episode. FUCKING WATCH IT.
Black,"It genuinely had no right being that good.  A lot of people say Season 1 is pretty bad, I personally think it's not as bad as people think but it's definitely the worst one. After that the show gets better with each seasons.  
  
I think Season 1 is pretty mediocre because they really tried to copy Spartacus/Got in term of sex and nudity, after that they did their own thing and it got much better.  
  
Keep at it, the characters are great, the action is good, the plot is very good, and Toby Stephens is really really good in this.  
  
I think this was one of the most overlooked show in recent years, I don't want to say underrated because most people who've seen the show agree that it's really good (personally think it's way better than Spartacus) but it seems a lot of people aren't even aware this show exist."
Wanted,I imagine she's not looking forward to spending another 7 months alone in Romania shooting season 2.
Wanted,"She's not making any friends in the writer's room, I'm sure, but everything quoted in the article about Wednesday is accurate.

The show is infinitely better during the first, Burton episodes, the love triangle is forced and stupid, some of Wednesday's dialogue is completely facile, forced, and out of character."
Wanted,">There was a line about a dress she has to wear for a school dance and she says, ‘Oh my god I love it. Ugh, I can’t believe I said that. I literally hate myself.’ I had to go, ‘No.’”

Hell, that is some bad writing, kudos to her for not just going along with it, despite her young age. But now she seems to become the next big thing, so I guess it worked out."
Wanted,I don't like how much this sounds like the Witcher writing room.
Wanted,Her criticism about the writing actually reads pretty mild. Sounds like she had to rein some thing in because they just didn't fit right.
Wanted,Wednesday didn’t feel like the Addams Family. It felt like they used it as a skin to do a typical teen mystery show.
Wanted,"I thought it was weird that they had a forced love storyline and turned Wednesday into a hero.

In the first episode she dumps piranhas in a pool. She should've stayed chaotic evil."
Wanted,"Good lord, she's not holding back. It's a shame that the show that got her so popular wasn't as enjoyable to work on as she probably would have hoped. Hopefully her reputation leads to projects she's more passionate about though, because she seems a lot more interested in bigger projects than teen drama, which, y'know, good for her."
Wanted,"I'm always curious as to why certain shows blow up the way they do. 

I thought Wednesday was pretty average to be honest."
Wanted,[deleted]
Wanted,Listening to interviews with her you can tell she’s really into film. If that’s what she wants to do then all the power to her
Wanted,"It's a real shame this article fails to mention she's been bumped up to executive producer on Season 2, which is a big deal."
Wanted,It's great to see an actor so aware of the character to help improve the show.  Disappointing that they have to do it secretly.  I imagine The Witcher would be a better show if Henry Cavill's input was taken more seriously than the show runners who don't like the source material.
Wanted,"I guess she's trying to go the robert pattinson route, the problem is wednesday was way better received than twilight, and she's the sole face of the project. I don't think it will end up going well for her, to be honest."
Wanted,"All this ""controversy"" is so cringe. The show isn't a masterpiece, it's a decent tween drama with a solid premise that falls into classic tropes.not only that but it's clear they want to franchise so hard.


An actor is allowed to not love the work they are a part of, and not want to sign on to being a single character for the next 10 years BCS execs want to churn out an endless line of spin offs for an attempt at an infinite money glitch"
Wanted,Talk about confidence. I'd have taken the first offer to be in a Netflix show.
Wanted,Let’s acknowledge the possibility that this is all just marketing to blur her character and public persona like they did with Aubrey Plaza.
Wanted,"I was so underwhelmed with Wednesday, I was expecting something darker not some teen mystery shit.

I have enjoyed Jennas other work and do look forward to her films."
Wanted,The writers just wanted to make another 08/15 teen highschool drama out of wednesday.
Wanted,"Legend. The show needed to end after 1 season, and now it can."
Wanted,She's probably still pissed at them for making her keep working when she blatantly had COVID and was just just waiting on the test results
Wanted,If she didn’t want it to be a hit she shouldn’t have made it better by pushing back against the insipid teen drama shit they were trying to pull off.
Wanted,">“Everything that Wednesday does, everything I had to play, did not make sense for her character at all.""

Netflix writers and not understanding the source material, name a more iconic due."
Wanted,Even Katherine Heigl is rolling her eyes at this one.
Wanted,Ironically anti-Ortega article that explains why she is right
Wanted,"It's unfortunate that her lack of workplace experience is showing in these exchanges. Her popularity exploded thanks to this show, but the public's love is fickle. They don't take kindly when they think you ungrateful.

Jennifer Lawrence learned the hard way that it's a small trip between internet darling to internet boogeyman."
Wanted,"Given that the WGA are negotiating a new contract and may strike in May, it was incredibly ill advised to make these comments. She may find out sooner rather than later how hard it is to make a tv show without them."
Wanted,I’m sure George Clooney would have preferred Movies as well when cast for E.R.
Wanted,"TV is such a communal endeavor, and having input from actors on the scripts and their characters is invaluable. Disagreements on creative are going to happen and its good that Jenna had a POV and told the writers as such for the betterment of the series. That being said, dragging the writers and other crew like this in such a public way is really unprofessional and simply unnecessary. Other cast and crew could go their entire lives and never work on a show as popular as Wednesday, and now knowing that the star hates it this much, looks down on it in many ways, and wishes she was doing something else is an unbelievable downer. It's completely fine for Jenna to feel this way, I have no issue with that. But repeatedly discussing it in the press is wrong and ultimately hurtful."
Wanted,It's so crazy how after hype dies down everyone is so willing to say the show isn't as good as everyone originally tried to make it sound like it was.
Wanted,Glad to see people see this show for the overrated teen schlock that it is
Wanted,"Not being successful; that’s a bold strategy Cotton, let’s see if it plays out for her."
Wanted,I did not like the show tbh. Didn’t get the hype at all. Just seemed like another angsty teen Netflix show with a recognizable brand and director attached to it.
Wanted,Just don’t do season 2 then.
Wanted,"Some of these actors are unbelievable. A starring role, millions of dollars and still they are not happy."
Wanted,"One of the writers is responding to her on Twitter, calling her out. But with the things she said she changed I feel like the only way it will play out is that writer won’t be able to return for next season. She’s much more important to the show and I feel like it was a mistake on his part to respond publicly.

https://imgur.com/a/Fyl5BPS/"
Wanted,"Oh sure, she hates all the success lol. She’s young and dumb like all of us at that age."
Wanted,I gotta be honest... I'm a little shocked that the show was as popular as it was. I grew up with the original movies and the cartoons and didn't think it would really be such a hit with the modern crowd.
Wanted,"They can change the whole writer's room, and it would probably benefit the show. They can't change the lead actress without tanking the show. JO knows that. I don't blame her for not wanting to get stuck on some mediocre CW show and watching her career get tied to that kind of junk. She is right to speak out. Wednesday is mediocre, but has the potential to be good. Let it be good."
Wanted,The first mistake is thinking she’s not replaceable. Everyone is.
Wanted,Really looking forward to her no longer being the flavour of the month.
Wanted,It’s obvious she’s already over doing scary/horror.
Wanted,The Honest Trailer for Wednesday really nails this
Wanted,Jenna Ortega; I didn’t ask for this 🥴
Wanted,"Honestly, the series felt really corny.  The writing and plot were so teen driven and predictable.  I watched it with my 8 and 10yr old.  They loved it, it worked for a family show.  But it wasn't written well at all.  I guessed every silly plot point the entire way.  Jenna carried this thing on her back.  I kind of hope they wrap in s2 and she can go on to do better things."
Wanted,I am always surprised that she is just 1.55m.
Wanted,"Can’t blame her. She’s really talented. Wednesday’s fun, but move on."
Wanted,The Henry Cavill syndrome. Love it.
Wanted,"I'm honestly surprised by how many in here dislikes the show, or only likes the first two episodes, because ""Burton"".  
 I had no Idea he was only involved in the first two episodes. I think the show was quite good, so does everyone else I have talked to about it.  
Also in this interview she's so ""in character"" that I would guess it's part of marketing for the show. It seems like everyone in here is taking it at face value? Am I missing something?"
Wanted,Sometimes it’s scheduling…a movie requires them to shoot for 6 weeks and maybe a few reshoots but a tv show requires a lot more time
Wanted,And look because of the show she's starting in a Beetlejuice sequel with Michael Keaton.
Wanted,"My niece loves this show so that’s cool, but I can’t see myself ever watching an episode of this."
Wanted,Probably doesn’t wanna be trapped for 7 seasons
Wanted,"Thank God, because I know I can’t live without the stellar acting in films the like of SCREAM 10

/s"
Wanted,"As someone with really specific tastes in show that usually hates mainstream things, I absolutely loved Wednesday beginning to end. Something about it just felt like a geniune effort from a team to make a fun show with a teen thematic. It felt like discovering a super fun show on TV back in the 2000s, not just another entry in the endless things under either DC, Marvel or weird solo actor projects that end up big only because of Controversy. Ironically, for all the teen dialogue, Wednesday actually made me feel quite young and innocent again while watching it, despite some of the dark subject matter.  


  
I honestly feel much of the people hating on Burton and his writers for this show just shows how much differently they approached this show compared to other modern hits. Their writing wasn't focused on tying it into weird worldbuilding and lore, or shocking viewers with random deaths, etc. They just went it at from a very clear goal and aim for the kind of things Wednesday as a character would work with and the stuff she wouldn't. This is especially fine considering that contrary to what most people are saying here, almost NONE of the Wednesday family members have ever had any sort of consistant characterization, especially Wednesday. They're all ""weird"" but the way in which they express it in their dialogue has never been a standard in any of the versions of the family. Wednesday here I feel actually did by far the best job of combining the aspects of a loving family with one that is weird not just because of their gothic style, but because they're geniunely involved in fucked up shit like murder plots and more. Wednesday herself felt interesting to watch as her dialogue wasn't just a gimmick. Her constant bite at other characters ends having both small and big consequences, from pushing people away even when she doesn't want to, to almost killing one of the people she actually considers a friend.  


  
This show honestly feels old in the best ways possible while still being awesome in terms of camera work and pacing and I really hope they stick with it instead of just forcing itself to be new and hip like people in these comments want it to."
Wanted,She is really putting her foot in her mouth recently isn't she?
Wanted,Loser didn't even eat real chicken on hot ones.
Wanted,"I really dislike her attitude and demeanour. I know a lot of people are loving her “girl boss” nature - which is a weird trend right now where people are celebrating female celebrities for being rude and off putting for some reason. 

I just really don’t need to hear celebrities whinging. The gall she has to criticise the writing team and complain about it proves how untouchable she feels and how lucky she is. The average population has to do things they don’t want to do at work. Instead of whinging about what you have to do, why not express gratitude. She has plenty of films on her resume and can keep doing it in the future. She will not struggle to be booked, and she knows it, which is why she has such an asshole attitude. 

She is pretentious and I’m completely over hearing about her interviews. I’ve never seen anything from her except for frowning and bitching, or just being unbelievably rude to interviewers. 

Her attitude has deterred me from viewing things she is in because now her acting just annoys me. 

She is ridiculously cocky and the complete opposite of down to earth. See Brendan Fraser and  Ke Huy Quan at the Oscar’s the other day - imagine Jenna in their place. I’m tired of celebrating celebrities like her and would much rather celebrate the ones who are grateful"
Wanted,"This is starting to give me shades of Jennifer Lopez' ""Movieline"" interview back in 1998 when she was first blowing up (basically trashed a bunch of actors & scripts as she felt pretty untouchable at the time).

&#x200B;

I get that Ortega might be unhappy with some of the writing - I get that she may prefer film to TV.  She may regret playing it out in public as much as she has been."
Wanted,"Girl, just be happy you’re an artist getting a hefty paycheck to do something you love for a living."
Wanted,"She is right though, the plot is beyond stupid and full of tiktok baiting scenes."
Wanted,😭 I’m too popular and have too much money- Her
Wanted,"I do feel bad for actors giving shows a chance, trying to pad their resume, and the show becomes this cultural phenomenon and now they have to spend the rest of their life playing and reliving that character and acting like it was this great experience. Even if they go on to do work they love and are proud of, its that one character they'll be asked about."
Wanted,"So girl get popular but wishes she wasn't on popular show to do film to become popular?  

Did I get that right because from what I've seen, she's everywhere now and doesn't seem to be not enjoying the spotlight?"
Wanted,This must be her 15 minutes of fame that she's being plugged roughly every fifth article.
Wanted,the fandom for this girl hasn't even formed yet and she's already alienating the hell out of everyone
Wanted,She's kinda starting to annoy me and she's to young for that. Quit it.
Wanted,"I liked this girl (as in public person) at first, but after seeing some recent public appareances, I feel she believes she is entitled.   


Just my feeling."
Wanted,"Sounds to me like she wants to be on that Robert Pattinson, Daniel Radcliffe abstract film actor in a rush. She’s barely been famous for a year and she already wants what they spent about a decade of work doing and building a reputation and their acting skills. Girl needs to chill out and just ride the wave and fluff her resume"
Wanted,"People are so negative. I thought it was a decent show. That being said, Ortega obviously helped a lot."
Wanted,"In another universe she could be a waitress in LA trying to land a commercial

In this one she's a 20-year old multimillionaire"
Wanted,She is sounding more and more insufferable every time she talks. Hate to tell her but Hollywood history is littered with young starlets just like her.  There are 50 girls waiting in the wings to take her place.
Wanted,"I mean people are sucking her off now, but I’ve seen Scream this weekend and it was meh, but her performance was a standout in terms of how bad it was. Like shockingly bad. In Wednesday she didn’t have to emote, but I reckon the more she stars in projects where she actually has to act, the more people will realize that she’s not all that."
Wanted,"the show is good and all, but Wednesday herself seems like from a different world than everyone else. That's the point, yes, but if she's so obsessed with death and pain and loneliness how... is it... that she's the most popular girl in school with all these friends and love interests? it just doesn't fit.  It's incredibly CW.  I wish there was a bit more ACTUAL gothic odd-ness going on in the story."
Wanted,"I never watched it, seemed overrated."
Wanted,">There was a line about a dress she has to wear for a school dance and she says, ‘Oh my god I love it. Ugh, I can’t believe I said that. I literally hate myself.’ I had to go, ‘No.’”

""Oh my god, I love it"" is never something Wednesday Adams should say. Fire the writer who wrote that line for her."
Wanted,Girl has one hit show and thinks she is Streep.
Wanted,She sounds like a spoiled brat.
Wanted,So tired of hearing about this actor and how the show supposedly revolves around her decisions (and not the showrunner/writer/director/studio). Such PR nonsense.
Wanted,Ahh tv is so much better than film these days… you’d think these kids would get that.
Wanted,"I get where she is coming from (not wanting to be stuck doing this show for years) but she has got to stop slagging off the thing that has brought her the success she is now enjoying.

She is a professional. There is a way to handle frustration with a project and slamming it in the press ain't the way to go about it."
Wanted,She better be careful or she’ll end up like Constance Wu if she comes off as too ungrateful.
Wanted,She uh... really wants to just tank the goodwill she gained in the last year hm?
Wanted,Wow starting to really not like her
Wanted,Man if i had a nickle when an actor who got famous thanks to some  tv show thought they should do movies and are for movies. I'd have lots of nickles.
Wanted,Such an annoying face
Wanted,"I liked Wednesday, but Ortega gave off an off putting vibe on SNL."
Wanted,"Haven't watched the show, but the headline immediately made me think of Krusty the Klown.  

Basically ""They asked me to do their crappy show, and I threw those phony suits out on their ass!  Then they came back with a dump truck full of money...  and I just had no choice."""
Wanted,I still can’t figure what it was people liked about that show. She’s clearly an It girl but damn that show was not good on any level.
Wanted,I wish I got famous so I could whine about it
Wanted,I like how everyone that films a Netflix show comes out of it and talks like they were serving time in a POW camp.
Wanted,"She’ll eventually gain a reputation of being hard to work with.

We really need another monotone, blank actor?"
Wanted,"She sounds very ungrateful. Not every show is a great experience, but a lot of people didn’t know who the hell she was before this. I only knew of her from the Scream movie and Wednesday. She isn’t doing herself any favors by saying stuff like this ( I’m sure writers aren’t happy)"
Wanted,"Sound a littel douche for a relative newcomer. 

On the other hand, yeah, amazing films like Sream 8 & Scream 9 surely “prove herself”."
Wanted,She sounds like An absolute stinkin brat
Wanted,She is definitely not movie star caliber.
Wanted,"Oh, she'd rather be making little money doing obscure indie films and having to scrap for each new role instead of having a massive hit propel her to huge paydays and producers throwing prime roles her way? 

Shut. The. Fuck. Up."
Wanted,[deleted]
Wanted,This bitch is insufferable.  Some new shit everyday.
Wanted,"I'm sure she's crying herself to sleep every night on a huge pile of money.  

Meanwhile my students are struggling to afford gas for their cars to come to class but You Da Real Victim, Jenna."
The Day I Met El Chapo,"someone posted a vimeo link of the how i met your dad pilot. i liked it tbh but not worth having greta gerwig stuck on a network sitcom for sure.

edit: her talk show interview implied that test audiences didn't like her and i kind of get that even though i liked her."
The Day I Met El Chapo,The only good joke so far was the British guy telling his girl-roommate she looked like a million pounds
The Day I Met El Chapo,"I think the thing with this show isn’t even that it’s outright bad, it’s just… very bland. Most of the actors are decent enough (I like the British guy and Valentina), but as I watch season 2 it’s very clear that the only thing carrying the show is that it’s a spin-off of HIMYM. If this was its own show, I fully believe it would have been canceled after season 1.

EDIT: also, I cannot fucking stand the actress that’s playing the mother in the current time, telling the story. I don’t know what it is, but she plays it like a ditzy drunk while Hillary Duff doesn’t play it that way at all"
The Day I Met El Chapo,"No, let's not. It was terrible and a pale imitation of its predecessor. Apart from the final season."
The Day I Met El Chapo,I just don't know how everyone is already flanderized in s1 itself. Writing in this one feels bad.
The Day I Met El Chapo,Nah
The Day I Met El Chapo,Let’s not
The Day I Met El Chapo,I think S2 has been a big jump up so far and is bringing back some of the original magic!
The Day I Met El Chapo,I thought that was never released.
The Day I Met El Chapo,"if that's a good joke, bad ones must be the equivalent of anal birth"
The Day I Met El Chapo,The final season hurt more because the mother (Cristin Milioti) was great in it.
The Day I Met El Chapo,it was posted on here a couple years ago or something.
The Day I Met El Chapo,I think it's pretty funny
The Day I Met El Chapo,">	Cristin Milioti

I liked her in all the things she’s been in, those big ole eyes are captivating."
The Day I Met El Chapo,I googled it and found it
The Day I Met El Chapo,"They used to put all their stuff online for free, people stopped watching and they found its cheaper just to air reruns on The Office and shit like that (many channels have switch to this format though, not just CC). Viacom mostly abandoned the channel in like mid-2010s except The Daily Show."
The Day I Met El Chapo,"Cheaper and easier to buy or rerun proven content, than develop new stuff."
The Day I Met El Chapo,History Channel is pretty much the same. Swamp People. American Pickers. Pawnshop.  Ancient Aliens.  With the occasional holiday special about WWII.
The Day I Met El Chapo,"What happened? People stopped watching the channel regularly. You, yourself, said you stopped watching years ago. So, the only people who are left love these blocks. They put them on as background noise. Everyone else has turned to streaming. Netflix has really grown as the place to have stand-up specials now."
The Day I Met El Chapo,"90s Comedy Central was so awesome. Dr Katz, Kids in the Hall, Strangers with Candy, constant stand up specials, and early South Park."
The Day I Met El Chapo,MTV plays nothing but Ridiculousness
The Day I Met El Chapo,Comedy Central has added Seinfeld to their rotation now.
The Day I Met El Chapo,"Same thing that happened to Mtv.  Cable networks that made their name catering to the teen/20-something set were hurt pretty hard when that demographic dropped pay cable tv.  They survive by cutting most of their original programming except for maybe a few shows that are dirt cheap to produce and then just running lots of reruns and movies.  It gets enough eyeballs to justify keeping them around and collecting the cable fees, but their brands have lost all cultural relevance."
The Day I Met El Chapo,TruTV is the Impractical Jokers and March Madness channel
The Day I Met El Chapo,I remember thinking they were too repetitive in the 90s when they constantly played National Lampoon's Vacation and Back to School. Little did I know those were the golden years.
The Day I Met El Chapo,"as ratings for networks started getting lower, so did the ad rates. and almost all cable networks started trimming fat and only airing shows they know people would watch reruns of excessively in a desperate attempt to get more viewers and ad revenue back. that's why comedy central depends on South Park, Seinfeld, and The Office, why MTV depends on basically ridiculousness alone (and new episodes of their other shows), and so on.

over the years, with the declining budgets and mergers, Comedy Central has also lost much of their original content. South Park has influenced them to make most of their originals animated content, including a revival of Ren and Stimpy and some meh Colbert stuff like Tooning Out the News and Fairview. and even then Paramount+ takes some of those shows for themselves, like the new Beavis and Butt-Head. they also decided making comedy movies is cheaper than making live action shows, and have committed to doing that recently. they're at least still committed to The Daily Show, even with Trevor Noah leaving and a concerning year where they moved to a tiny studio with no audience.

they seem to have some scripted live action shows still but not much. they willingly gave some, like The Other Two and South Side, to HBO Max where they seem to be doing a lot better. seem like Crank Yankers and Awkwafina's show are still around. rip detroiters."
The Day I Met El Chapo,"Viacom. Literally the worst.was always bad, but theast time I was in a hotel noticed MTV is just ridiculousness now 24x7"
The Day I Met El Chapo,"It's the same on all channels. I used to love Cartoon Network in the 90s and 00s. About 3 years ago I tuned in for the first time in years and it was just Teen Titans Go all day long. That is literally all they were playing.

Cable is in a very sad state nowadays. Not worth the hundreds of dollars it costs a month."
The Day I Met El Chapo,I think getting rid of all the Stand Up related material was a huge factor.
The Day I Met El Chapo,The show Corporate was actually REALLY good. They made that. Unfortunately it cancelled.
The Day I Met El Chapo,"Viacom killed it slowly. The channel used to have a lot of dedicated comedy people/programmers there, at its peak programming was pretty great IMO. Then mergers, that staff was stretched more and more across may channels (MTV, Spike, etc.) as the model of reruns/nostalgia took over. They got less and less into original programming and got run out on the stand-up specials from competitors. Netflix really went hard outbidding them for a lot (who would later themselves stop doing). 

Then, the axe was then dropped a couple years ago when a large chunk of remaining staff was let go. It's now like a lot of the other Viacom channels that have a more profitable business model in reruns. Any new/original programming that might've originally aired there now tends to go to Paramount+."
The Day I Met El Chapo,"Now now, they also have dildo commercials at 430am."
The Day I Met El Chapo,Remember when all the comedians used to get together and roast a celebrity? Lisa Lampanelli would joke about how she likes to bang black dudes.
The Day I Met El Chapo,A major chunk of my youth was spent watching stand up specials and reruns of kids in the hall and snl. I think it all went to shit after Chapelle left. John Stewart leaving was the nail in the coffin.
The Day I Met El Chapo,I notice this as well about twice a year when I happen to be in a hotel room. I always end up watching it too because I’d rather watch South Park or the office reruns then duck dynasty or whatever else is on.
The Day I Met El Chapo,"The death of cable. These channels will all be bought up soon and eventually die out with the popular remnants IP being kept. 
TVs will just become large internet connected monitors that play “apps” aka channels. Like peacock, YouTube, hbo, Disney/Hulu, Prime, etc. 
so all these cable networks will eventually get bought by the big “apps” and we will end up where we started when TV has like  7 “channels” that host all these programs / legacy channels"
The Day I Met El Chapo,"Remember when South Park was not allowed to air before 11 PM because it was 'too vulgar' for TV? I had to stay way past my bedtime to catch a glimpse of an episode. It was like a challenge to sneak up and watch it without parents noticing. I remember catching, like, half an episode and talking about it the next day at recess. It was like a TV phenomenon back in the day. That wacky vulgar cartoon that airs in the middle of the night.

Now it just airs in blocks during the afternoon. Times have changed."
The Day I Met El Chapo,And the ads last so much longer than I remember now too!
The Day I Met El Chapo,"Comedy Central is where I discovered the masterpiece that is *Idiocracy* (secret stash, uncensored)"
The Day I Met El Chapo,"Streaming. Binge watching. 

They're literally mimicking the viewing habits of a whole generation."
The Day I Met El Chapo,"Most channels do this now.

MTV = ridiculousness and catfish 

TruTV = impractical jokers 

USA network = law and order svu"
The Day I Met El Chapo,"""I watches cable for the first time in years today""  
  
 You answered it yourself. Streaming happened to it"
The Day I Met El Chapo,Reruns of The Office and South Park all day and night? Damn.... I might have to get cable again.
The Day I Met El Chapo,Why use many show when few show do trick?
The Day I Met El Chapo,"That's funny, Comedy Central *started* by showing Benny Hill and Monty Python all day. In between the random stand up and Penn Jillette doing all their voice work. Time is a flat circle."
The Day I Met El Chapo,"Viacom has been doing this for years with their networks (MTV, Comedy Central, etc.) They do it because it’s cheaper to air something already paid for, and because they get decent numbers, still, while airing the same old crap. They know cable is dying out so they’re spending the money on streaming services and content for streaming services."
The Day I Met El Chapo,That's not true! ^(sometimes they play an episode or two of Futurama and the Cleveland show)
The Day I Met El Chapo,Cable TV is surviving only because of live sports.  Once people find alternatives for those en mass expect cable to just straight up stop being something you can get except in certain markets that have limited internet access.
The Day I Met El Chapo,"If you think that’s bad, MTV plays Ridiculousness 24/7."
The Day I Met El Chapo,"I was recently watching Broad City and realized that although it felt like just yesterday,  all these original scripted comedies just kind of disappeared one day off cable TV"
The Day I Met El Chapo,"Video killed the radio star. Netflix killed the cable star. 

Netflix is the Walmart of streaming services. Come in cheap with some new ideas, drive everyone out of business, hike prices and churn out mostly crap but we just accept it."
The Day I Met El Chapo,"What happened is during the pandemic, they cut costs by immediately canceling all live-action content they were producing at the time, so now they're basically relying on scraps."
The Day I Met El Chapo,I wish there was a 24/7 Three Stooges channel
The Day I Met El Chapo,Wait til OP tries to watch music videos on MTV
The Day I Met El Chapo,Broadcast television sucks now.  I can’t tell you the last time I watched a new show or tuned in live to watch something (other than sports).
The Day I Met El Chapo,Out of all the channels on TV to complain about Comedy Central is one of the last ones. Always my go to Channel when there is nothing on
The Day I Met El Chapo,"It’s like the History Channel, it only airs Pawn Stars anymore"
The Day I Met El Chapo,"Why does the IFC (Independent Film Channel) show reruns of Everyone Loves Raymond, Two and a Half Men, etc…such a waste."
The Day I Met El Chapo,Let’s just say TLC isn’t The Learning Channel anymore and CMT doesn’t hardly ever play country music videos anymore
The Day I Met El Chapo,"It's the same thing happening to all cable channels. Last I checked, Cartoon Network was nothing but Teen Titans Go, Gumball, and maybe Craig of the Creek."
The Day I Met El Chapo,TV died.
The Day I Met El Chapo,"Went to the inlaws over xmas, the internet was so bad we were forced to watch cable TV. I've never had a worse headache in my life watching cable TV with non stop scam commercials and with very small segments of crappy TV shows pushed in-between them. I'm surprised cable TV even still exists"
The Day I Met El Chapo,"I KNOW!

I stopped watching much television several years ago, and earlier last year I happened to end up in a room with a television with nothing to do, so I turned in to Comedy Central, and was shocked to find that they just played nothing but blocks of the exact same show for like the whole day. It was like USA(which also used to have a bunch of variety).

I didn't even give Comedy Central another chance. It wasn't worth it."
The Day I Met El Chapo,"I’m still pissed they pulled Tosh.0 off the air. It was the only show I watched, and they claimed it was because they were moving towards animation, which is bullshit, because since then they’ve given Charlemagne and Stephen Colbert shows"
The Day I Met El Chapo,"Cable TV is just crap nowadays. Every channel has scaled back the variety to just one or 2 specific themes and just run the same shows all day, every day. Between that, and the apparent gutting of the major streaming services, the amount of good content has dropped dramatically in the last few years"
The Day I Met El Chapo,"Remember Dr. Katz? Viva Variety? The Daily Show with Craig Kilborn? It was such a unique channel, but it grew up fast. I miss the old days too."
The Day I Met El Chapo,"MTV is just Ridiculousness, like right now, turn it on, there it is, ridiculous."
The Day I Met El Chapo,MTV is even worse. Total waste of a 40 year cable flagship. All they play is ridiculousness for 14 hours a day with some catfish the show sprinkled in.
The Day I Met El Chapo,"If this is true, then I am exactly their target demographic"
The Day I Met El Chapo,All the good stuff has gone to streaming these days.
The Day I Met El Chapo,Cable is dead. Long live cable (streaming).
The Day I Met El Chapo,Wait until you find the Ridiculousness channel (MTV).
The Day I Met El Chapo,"same thing happened to most cable channels, they stopped creating new content because the reruns are getting viewers. The Daily Show hasn't been the same since Jon Stewart left so they quit rerunning it throughout the day and they never replaced Colbert so they have crappy shows that no one wants to see and reruns so they run the reruns. I admit, I still watch The Office on there and Seinfeld. I got sick of South Park reruns over the pandemic but people are still watching them all day long. Hopefully, they get a big hitter to take over The Daily Show and get new episodes of Drunk History and bring in a new sketch show or two. If you look at the other cable channels, it's even worse. The History Channel doesn't even show WWII shows anymore, it's nothing related to history, like MTV never showing anything related to music or what has happened to my beloved Science Channel which now shows about 10 hours of science a week and the rest of pseudo-science, conspiracy and paranormal. Hell, I used to love this channel called Bravo because it showed Operas and now all it shows are these ""Real Housewife"" trainwrecks and who remembers The Learning Channel that was a government cable channels about educating the people and now it's just ridiculous stupid ""Hey look at fatso"" shows and disgusting shows. Cable is dying because they let it. Streaming is getting old fast because there are too damn many of them. Some rich assed company like Apple should just buy Netflix, Amazon, Time Warner,  Paramount and Hulu and combine them into one service."
The Day I Met El Chapo,"Outside of Detroiters (which they only gave 2 seasons), I can't even remember the last great new original program for the channel."
The Day I Met El Chapo,Cable TV is dead.
The Day I Met El Chapo,"All cable television has become garbage. It is either reality shows (A&E, History, Discovery, etc) or just syndication rerun marathons.

There isnt enough money to be made in advertising anymore to fund real productions, especially for a channel like Comedy Central.

The focus has switched to streaming platforms. That is where the money is, which the channels can collect directly from user subscriptions instead of dealing with a cable company and advertisers. And that is where all the original programming has moved to."
The Day I Met El Chapo,"Wait until you watch MTV, they just air Ridiculousness over and over again until the end of time"
The Day I Met El Chapo,">What the heck happened to Comedy Central? **I watched cable for the first time in years today** and they were literally only playing The Office and South Park all day (and night) long.

Many people like you, not watching cable for years, is the answer. Viewership down = No money to make the things they used to make. Reruns are keeping the channel alive to continue to produce the few things they still can make. When the time comes that both South Park and The Daily Show come to an end, Comedy Central will have no function except to rerun old content. It will become a husk of its former self, just like MTV which now just runs Ridiculousness episodes over and over all day, every day and almost nothing else."
The Day I Met El Chapo,"The Office is the most streamed show on Netflix, making up 7% of its traffic, and Netflix consists of 15% of the total traffic on the Internet.  They simply realized that the only thing people really *want* to watch is The Office, so they ran with it."
The Day I Met El Chapo,It’s my fault. I leave the Office on in the background while I work.
The Day I Met El Chapo,"my girlfriends mother still has cable television and it is the most fascinating thing to me. All week leading up to NYE there was a west wing marathon that just never stopped. the thing is though there are commericals like every 30 seconds compared to just streaming it on HBO Max. i cant imagine all the time i wasted as a kid watching commericals, super depressing"
The Day I Met El Chapo,"I feel that is basically ever single cable channel these days. MTV is Ridiculousness all day. CC is the office all day. TLC is 1000 lb Best Friend/1000 lb Sisters/600 lb Life, IFC doesn't even show movies anymore, it's just syndicated network sitcoms for hours on end (Scrubs for 6 hours, Threes Company for 6 hours...). I don't even know who watches these channels like this anymore."
The Day I Met El Chapo,"They found that people ""watch"" more TV when they don't ""active watch"" but just leave it on in the background. They'll do this if there's something familiar and popular that's just playing repeat episodes for hours. This is why all of the cable channels do this now. I'm sure half of you have a girlfriend who just puts the channel on MTV or TBS or whatever for 4 hours while she does work in the background."
The Day I Met El Chapo,"Don't waste your time with TLC (the learning channel), you'll view nothing but trashy ""reality"" shows. Thousand pound sisters, Sister Wives, fake storage shows and too many more ridiculous drivel. In the olden days, one might LEARN something. Don't get me started on MTV."
The Day I Met El Chapo,"I watched Comedy Central nonstop from the mid to late 2000s. It sounds like nothing has changed.

They would play Office Space, Joe Dirt, and old, obscure comedies with actors that look really familiar but you're not sure from where like [Duplex](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0266489/)."
The Day I Met El Chapo,They gave the people what they want.
The Day I Met El Chapo,"You taught them this, dad!

TBH, I watch it as background noise sometimes, but the house ads for RuPaul's drag race make me want to cancel my cable. 

Why the fuck am I getting like 10 house ads for the same thing on a channel that isn't the channel I'm watching. And the ads are geared towards people who might be interested, so they are disruptive and obnoxious as fuck (why the show is popular)."
The Day I Met El Chapo,"CC went downhill fast after Key & Peele was done. Viacom regrets letting Jordan Peele go, big time as they could have done more projects with him. Especially after the success of Get Out. Pretty sure that’s why they’re throwing a gazillion dollars at Taylor Sheridan. They don’t want to make that same mistake twice."
The Day I Met El Chapo,Tbf these are the best shows
The Day I Met El Chapo,"I mean, those are two hilarious shows"
The Day I Met El Chapo,"Back in the day TV would be the curation of a lot of taste and culture. Think how MTV brought us music and fashion. Comedy Central brought entertainment, standup, movies. Adult Swim brought our love of retro and weird/experimental cartoons. 

Now the internet and social media do all that stuff faster and cheaper. You can watch films and shorts and parodies and standup people spent years of their lives making and do so all for free one after another and never run out of new things to watch. But without the relevance and audience, they're not a packed bar every night. They're a dive bar people remember going to when they were younger and still check every now and then to see if it's open. So they're not going to invest in making a lot of original content. They're just Twitch live streams playing someone's Paramount + account. They're keeping the doors open so they can make The Daily Show."
The Day I Met El Chapo,"I have a wall mounted television constantly on in an outbuilding that used to be a pool house, now I use it as a greenhouse to stage my marijuana seedlings. I keep it on since I've misplaced the remote and I'm too lazy to get a ladder.

It's been tuned to Comedy Central for about 2 years now and you're absolutely right."
The Day I Met El Chapo,"Cable is dead also , its impossible for me to watch things with ads."
The Day I Met El Chapo,Carlos destroyed it. Haven't been back since rofl
The Day I Met El Chapo,"You answered your question when you said you stopped watching.

Everyone else did too."
The Day I Met El Chapo,"Tru TV plays practical jokers 24/7 while MTV plays ridiculousness 24/7, must be the modern day cable network."
The Day I Met El Chapo,"""Comedy Central is gone, I am what remains"""
The Day I Met El Chapo,cable television died
The Day I Met El Chapo,"Daily Show is the only thing keeping the lights on. Even then, they may need help finding a new host."
The Day I Met El Chapo,"Viacom thought they were the big dogs in negotiations with distributors when things went to the internet, and it became virtually impossible to stream in many areas or on my streamers for what seemed like a decade; South Park luckily was able to continue streaming on South Park studios and eventually Hulu. This also extended to even cutting off certain cable companies in major markets.

That hubris also extended to their brand being strong due to the daily show with Jon Stewart, South Park, chapelle show, and later tosh.0 amongst others lead to them investing less in production. 

A lot of the new talent and previous CC performers chased the money and exposure on streamers. Don’t forget that CC did chapelle dirty, and Zach Galafanakis was the first comedy special on Netflix, Bill Burr being early money too.

Eyes going to streamers dried up revenue, so they leaned on re-runs, low production cost shows (and even still took chances here and there such as spades show a few years back, though it was cut pretty quickly. Ironically his podcast was in the top 20 this year)

TLDR; They thought their brand was strong enough to be the HBO of comedy (ironic, since they kind of dethroned HBO as the “hour special comedy” channel but got out-businessed by other streamers, specifically Netflix who could pay high dollar for namesake comedians to establish themselves

Ironically, a lot of the “new class” of comedians are averting the streamers because the blank checks have dried up except for all but the top talent, ie paying chapelle $10s of mm per special. Comics with a name are now realizing the power of their own brand/social media following, ownership of IP and self publication, and overall control to not be “cancelled” and are either selling their specials/live podcasts through their website or just hosting them on YouTube."
La Femme,I still love and rewatch the Highlander Show (Adrian Paul is best highlander and i'll fight anyone who disagrees) for many of the same reasons. 
La Femme,"Amazing TV show. Few can rival it in terms of plot tension and charismatic characters. Actors were casted in their respective roles so well that their portrayals stay unforgettable. And even though it does look dated nowadays, La Femme Nikita had it's style. Wardrobe, music, set design were very striking."
La Femme,"It was the Michael/Nikita romance which made the show.

Plus they had a deep background cast.

And Michael played the Cello."
La Femme,La femme Nikita was groundbreaking in its own right and after so many years can still hold its own in terms of value.
La Femme,"Loved this show so much!  Michael was such a rich character with economical moves, minimal words and a professional poker face.  Nikita was such a rebel and absolute kickass. Love them, I say!

My heart was also stolen by the solid ‘secondary’ characters. I cried when Birkoff died. The twin was such a stupid plot.  I can’t remember the character’s name but he rocked a silver pony tail and called Nikita Sugar. The only beacon of hope in Section One. The silly-not-so-silly British neighbor. He was a riot!

A side paragraph should be given to the anti-couple: Operations and the magnificent Madelaine. There are not enough words to properly compliment them. They were a book and a poem.

The music was amazing.

Also, the show should have ended in season 4. I absolutely contempt, abhor and reject that garbage that was season 5. No. No. No, no, no... it shouldn’t exist."
La Femme,"Loved this show deeply at one point in time. Yes, cheesy as hell but there’s something about it. It was all Michael and Nikita for me. Was obsessed with the 90s soundtrack. The fifth season is one of those “wish it never happened” seasons. It’s been about 6 years since I’ve seen the whole thing - may have to give it a rewatch soon. "
La Femme,It was good. I enjoyed it more than the reboot. The chemistry between Michael and Nikita was so much better.
La Femme,"On a very shallow note, I feel the need to mention Michael’s strut. The way he used to look sideways, checking the area for danger and then moving like he was in a runway... "
La Femme,"I love seeing this here! LFN still deserves to get a lot more attention than it does. I only watched it for the first time this year after it was recommended to me and quickly became obsessed despite it being dated in some areas. Yes, the shortened last season was shaky, but I think they were trying to give the story the ending they’d originally envisioned despite having very little time to do it, so I respect that. The CW’s version is good, but it doesn’t match the original IMO. "
La Femme,"Ah good old school USA, home to Weird Science, Duckman, La Femme Nikita and....Silk Stalkings. "
La Femme,It's steaming on Tubi right now. It was on the Roku channel for awhile before that. Watched it when it originally aired. I just finished rewatching the first season. Though dated  some now I still think it holds up pretty good.
La Femme,"Yeah, I caught a few episodes here or there back in the day and enjoyed them. I had no ability to catch up on the rest of it at the time though. It's on my list to somehow watch someday. "
La Femme,"Haven't seen La Femme, but I did enjoy CW's Nikita (2010-13)."
La Femme,"I am a huge fan of La Femme Nikita. Cast, concept, stories, music, visuals; it's all fascinating, compelling, riveting.  

Love the various guests (Simon MacKorkindale, Douglas O'Keeffe, Bruce Payne (Jurgen), Samia Shoaib (Elena), Kris Lemche (Hillinger), Nigel Bennett, Cindy Dolenc (Quinn), and so many others. 

Love the fact that it's always winter and snowing in a majority of the episodes, lol.  I re-watch the entire series about every two years or so, lol. I'm totally fine with the 5th season; just happy for the additional episodes.

Can anyone help me regarding the woman in the blue dress who is shown in each episode's opening titles (where the Mark Snow song is playing).  It might be Nikita undercover, but I don't remember her in a blue dress with brunette hair. Was the lady in blue from an actual episode? Thanks!"
La Femme,"This show really knew its own tone.  In S1E19 when Nikita tells Michael that a man tried to rape her, ""are you ok"" was only his second question.  His first response is ""did you kill him?"""
La Femme,"I much preferred the CWs Nikita, definitely a show that should have gotten more love whilst airing."
La Femme,"I'm sorry, but while NOT being a Highlander Roger Daltry was the best immortal.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdpat8t6E_8"
La Femme,No one can f*** with that cello.
La Femme,Walter. His name was Walter.
La Femme,"I love your description of Madeline and Operations! A book and a poem indeed.

The Birkoff twin subplot was quite silly, I agree. The newer characters like Quinn seemed tedious to me at first, but they did provide their own flavor to the series that complimented the strained dynamic the veteran characters like Nikita and Operations had."
La Femme,And the evil librarian!
La Femme,Hahaha. This for sure.
La Femme,And Monday Night Raw
La Femme,I just discovered it streaming...got to do a rewatch.
La Femme,I suspect Nikita would have done better if it wasn't being compared to La Femme Nikita. It was a good show on it's own but there was too much history in La Femme so it always seemed like a poor imitation to me and my friends who watched it when it came out.
La Femme,"I'm still on the first season and agree that it is also good, and a successful update of the original. Like I said, I hope to finish that soon."
La Femme,How Kalas killed him still pisses me off....
La Femme,"The guy who squealed like a pig in Deliverance, Ned Beatty did a masterful exhibition of the Cello on an episode of Homicide life on the streets.

La Femme,"Yes! Walter....

Thanks"

La Femme,"Man, I loved that show!"
La Femme,And the father of Stargate actor Rainbow Sun Francks

La Femme,I could be wrong but i think you like Star Trek.
La Femme,Being on a deserted island would be a perfect t time for a franchise rewatch lol
La Femme,You won't be disappointed with Mash. The series eclipses the movie.
La Femme,"Babylon 5.  

First season is rough; part of it is because (like many shows) the writers and cast were finding their footing.  But it introduces a *lot* of foundational stuff that ties in later on.  

If you get halfway into Season 2 and aren't somewhat intrigued, it may not be for you.  But don't bail based upon S1."
La Femme,"Re: SG1 and SGA are wonderful and if I were to draw a circle around 'shows that similar types of people like' it would be a circle around Stargate SG1, Atlantis and Farscape, the same great lore, characters and sense of humour, being able to be serious and also never taking itself too seriously - and hey if you're a fan of John and Aeryn... all am saying is later seasons of SG1 may well appeal to you....

[https://www.google.com/search?q=sg1+cameron+and+vala&rlz=1C1CHBF\_en-GBGB792GB792&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiD2NnU8\_3hAhVToXEKHePaCJMQ\_AUIDigB&biw=960&bih=1633#imgrc=3qJTX3ncW0-ubM:](https://www.google.com/search?q=sg1+cameron+and+vala&rlz=1C1CHBF_en-GBGB792GB792&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiD2NnU8_3hAhVToXEKHePaCJMQ_AUIDigB&biw=960&bih=1633#imgrc=3qJTX3ncW0-ubM:)

SGA is my favourite, but really you need to have seen about 8 seasons of lore of SG1 to get it as it builds on that lore. I love Farscape, but the Stargate shows is where my heart truly is.

SGU I thought was awful on my first watch, a betrayal of the Stargate franchise, I warmed a lot to it on my second watch but would never recommend it over the others, particularly not first without knowledge of the 15 or so seasons of lore that it relies on.

SG1 first season is pretty clunky and camp, but then so was Farscape's first season, so hey ho. They eventually lean into it and becomes very accomplished at the comedy elements as Farscape does."
La Femme,"Consider Space: Above and Beyond if you want more military SciFi.  

Remove Revolution from your list."
La Femme,"Check out Lexx, it was along the lines of Farscape."
La Femme,Loved firefly. A Sci fi show that pleasantly surprised me recently was 'nightflyer' on Netflix atm. Didn't expect much but enjoyed it.
La Femme,"I recommend Charlie Jade. Set and filmed in Cape Town, South Africa. Very unique. It has a cyberpunk vibe and also a bit like Sliders  with the 3 parallel worlds."
La Femme,"Stargate, hands down."
La Femme,"I'd personally recommend DS9 of the ones you listed even though I'm in the middle of it. I just started Andromeda recently and it's pretty fun and entertaining, DS9 though is just awesome"
La Femme,"As we seem to share tv interests, did you like the last season of Killjoys?  I never really gave it a fair chance, as it seemed like it was losing focus.
  
Also, an enthusiastic +1 for SG-1.  It's dated and goofy at times, but there's some great storytelling and an incredible sense of *heart* to it.  Which is to say, it reminds me a lot of Farscape."
La Femme,[deleted]
La Femme,"This might sound a bit random, but how about Futurama? Sci-fi show with great characters, epic love story, perfect final FINAL episode, great sci-fi stories, very funny and started originally the exact same year as Farscape in 1999."
La Femme,"Are you into video games, because I would have a number of recommendations outside of the TV recommendations others have mentioned"
La Femme,"Give Black Sails from Starz a shot. You mention action and adventure being something you are looking for in a choice, this show has that. It's what pirates of the Caribbean would have been without the fantastical stuff and had it been a premium TV show instead of movies."
La Femme,I'd definitely recommend the Stargate series I had just finished universe recently and now going through Stargate withdrawals...
La Femme,SG1 and SG Atlantis. Skip SGU. Then DS9.
La Femme,"Your ""planning to watch list"" is pretty good but alphas and nightflyers are skippable while revolution gets pretty iffy in some parts"
La Femme,"I know Babylon 5 can look pretty dated now effects wise, but for pure storytelling season 2-4 are some of the best Sci-Fi TV has ever had.  The Shadow War and then the Earth War are epic.  Season 1 is kinda meh, but it does a good job of world building that really starts to pay off in season 2.  Season 5 was a rushed mess, but those last 4 or 5 episodes are fantastic and tie up the characters arcs very well."
La Femme,"SG-1 ends up with Claudia Black and Ben Browder from Farscape. SG-1 also gets Lexa Doig from Andromeda. SG-1 season 1 might not be the best. Atlantis is quirkier. SGU is much different than the other Stargates.

Andromeda is free to watch in the US on the Roku channel. Don't need a roku device just need to register. Relic Hunter is free there also. Lexx is there also but it's a weird perverted space show.

Star Trek DS9 is pretty good. The episodes are hit and miss. Voyageur, Enterprise and Next Generation have some good episodes. 

Warehouse 13 is free to watch on IMDB freedive.

Starhunter Redux is on prime video apparently. It's not that great but it is something. 

You might also like Chuck (prime video), Burn Notice (hulu + prime video), Ash vs Evil Dead (netflix), White Collar (hulu), Psych (prime video), Reaper (free on ABC televisions throwback section), Doctor Who (prime video), Librarians (hulu), Red Dwarf?"
La Femme,"Farscape was so weird, which made it *so good.* We seem to have similar t.v. show taste. I would recommend Primeval and Revolution. There was also a new 'Nikita' that was released that I enjoyed. There is a foreign show called the 3%, which I would probably compare to The 100."
La Femme,Cowboy Bebop and Trigun. Both are excellent anime
La Femme,"Since you're interested in all genres. Check out 'godless'. Western series on Netflix, only 1 season. Its another show I was dubious about but then couldn't get enough when I watched it. Best series for me in a while."
La Femme,You want recommendations but you couldn't finish BSG.. uh.
La Femme,"Thanks for the info! Just curious, have you seen Deep Space Nine? I always see the two compared."
La Femme,"Thanks so much for sharing your thoughts! I think whats made me put off trying Stargate is mostly the sheer amount of episodes there are to watch, because like you said I do want to understand the lore so I’d be starting from the beginning. You’re making me think I should just go for it though. 

Plus seeing Ben and Claudia on the same show again would be awesome!"
La Femme,"Haven’t heard of that one, but definitely adding it to my list! Thank you! 

Why didn’t you like Revolution? I’m curious to know because I haven’t heard a whole lot about it."
La Femme,"Thank you! In what ways would you say it compares to Farscape? I’ve heard a few things that made me think it might not be what I’m looking for right now, but I could be wrong about that. I was planning to try it at some point."
La Femme,"not seen it but I know it's based on a book by George RR Martin, of Game of Thrones / Ice and Fire fame."
La Femme,"Interesting! I heard some not so great things about Nightflyers, but everyone has different taste. Would you say it’s pretty straightforward sci-fi, or more of a mix of sci-fi and horror?"
La Femme,This is why I love this sub. I’m always on the hunt for new shows to watch and I’ve never once heard of this one until now. Thanks so much!
La Femme,"Hands down and then hands up your ass, sg sucks."
La Femme,Thanks for your opinion on DS9! I’m curious if you’ve seen Babylon 5 because those two are so often compared. And I’m always curious to hear what people think of Andromeda because I rarely hear about that show.
La Femme,"You’re definitely right about us having similar tastes because I had the same issue with the last season of Killjoys. I really enjoyed the show up until that point (although I preferred Dark Matter overall), but you pretty much hit the nail on the head. It’s like as the stakes got higher the show started to lose more and more focus, and I never finished last season either. Still, I’m hopeful they can pull off an awesome final season since they know that’s all they’re going to get. I’m planning to finish s4 at some point. 

Thanks for adding your rec for SG-1! I think that’s what I’m going to jump into next. Have you seen Atlantis and SGU too?"
La Femme,"Thanks, you make a great case for iZombie! That show has been on my list for awhile and my sister is a big fan so I’ll definitely be giving it a shot. Plus, from what I know about it I think you’re right that it’s similar to the others I listed. 

Since we seem to have similar taste I would recommend that you try Eureka and Dark Matter if you haven’t yet - I think you’d like them!"
La Femme,Not random at all - that’s a pretty spot on recommendation! I should have thought to include it in my post because I watched and loved it too. :)
La Femme,"Not particularly, but I’ve been interested in trying to get into them now that their graphics are often so incredibly realistic. What would you recommend?"
La Femme,Black Sails is a freaking masterpiece. Great recommendation although I’ve seen it. Did you ever watch Crossbones? I’m sure it isn’t in Black Sails’ league (it was on NBC after all) but I’ve always wondered if it might be worth trying anyway.
La Femme,"Jesus, have you got better yet?"
La Femme,"Thanks! Honestly I wasn’t too keen on any of those, but I added them to the list because it’s always worth getting another perspective. Plus, people on this sub have changed my mind before and I was glad for it. 

Do you have an opinion on Dominion, Torchwood or Origin?"
La Femme,"Yep, everyone who commented about B5 here has convinced me. :)

I’ll definitely be giving it a try, and I’ll keep that in mind about season 1. 12 Monkeys had pretty much the same issue but when you look at how they used their first season to set up the rest of the show, I can’t complain. That kind of planning generally turns out well."
La Femme,"Thanks so much for all that really helpful info! I just finished The Peacekeeper Wars (I’m going to miss this show so much 😭) so I’m going to take a beat and then likely jump into SG-1 and go from there. 

I’m still curious about Andromeda though - have you seen all of it? I’m mostly wondering if it had a proper ending and whether it was consistently good. I’ve never heard of Relic Hunter though, how is that one? 

So many great recommendations! I’ve seen some of those and most of the rest are on my list. :D"
La Femme,"I know, I think I’m going to miss it a lot no matter what I watch next. It’s just such a special show.

Thanks for the recommendations! I enjoyed Nikita too - if you really liked it I highly recommend you try the original series La Femme Nikita. It’s a bit dated in some ways but it holds up really well for the most part, and it’s a fantastic watch. The original Michael and Nikita were absolutely electric on screen. 

I’ve had my eye on 3%! That one and a Danish series called The Rain look pretty similar to The 100, which interests me."
La Femme,Love Cowboy Bebop! Haven’t tried Trigun yet - thanks for the recommendation!
La Femme,"Thanks for your recommendation! It’s actually been on my list for awhile since I tend to like action oriented period pieces, but I may move it closer to the top. :D"
La Femme,Babylon 5 is soo much deeper it's a 5 year story arc with so much foreshadowing you can watch it 20 times and still find stuff in the background. Seriously anytime a character reads a newspaper the headline pays off 3 seasons latter. A group gets introduced in season 3 you see them walking around in the background season one . It has some of the best character actors and character story arcs of any show. The world is massively thought out with the writer pretty much writing a single 5 year story and than rewriting it several times to have fallbacks if they had to replace the actor and keep the story seamless and foreshadowing intact which they did a couple times
La Femme,"As others have said, there are some similarities with both shows. Both set on a space station is the main premise that’s easily comparable. The fact that DS9 was launched shortly after JMS (Babylon 5 creator) pitched his series is a bit telling. And while many may look for more similarities between the two to lock down on one being a rip-off, I’ll just forgo the controversy and say: watch both.

With both series, you can’t simply watch one and know how the other unfolds. Besides the most surface level premise, they are quite distinct from one another. More importantly, both have what you’re looking for in great, nuanced characters and action and adventure. Great antagonists as well. I highly recommend; they are both among my favorite sci-fi of all time."
La Femme,"I tuned out of DS9 early in its run, but I've seen a lot of praise for its later seasons.

What I do know is that the showrunner for B5 pitched the concept to Paramount, they rejected it, and soon thereafter they had their *own* series set on a space station.  Go figure."
La Femme,"its worth it - like I mean, more is better if you enjoy it right? As I say, a bit of leeway may be needed for season 1 - Skip Emancipation (ep 3 I believe), there could be more skippers but that ones the one that sticks out as worth just pretending it doesn't exist. just enjoy the campiness and be confident when tech gets better and the writers and actors start to get what the show is it becomes an absolute joy, and I can't imagine a fan of Farscape wouldn't get a kick out of it."
Skin Wars: Fresh Paint,"Anyone who unironically says that streaming is worse than cable, is either too young to actually remember cable, or is being paid by the cable industry to say it.

$1-200 a month for 500 channels, only 30 of which are worth watching, and they all have extremely restrictive release patterns (thank goodness for DVR)?  On top of 8-10 minutes of ads per 30 minutes of television?  No thanks.

I can pay for every single streaming service on the market for around 100 bucks a month (and even that's only if you include things like the WWE network).  Still cheaper than all but the most basic cable packages, and I get zero ads."
Skin Wars: Fresh Paint,"Sure, this is so much worse than being stuck with only one cable provider in your area that keeps hiking prices and offering BS deals that lock you in while providing crappy service and the worst customer services. 

I mean, being able to subscribe and unsubscribe to any streaming service whenever I want and only pay the monthly fee without any extra hidden fees or early termination fees really sucks and having some services that want to offer a free tier, like Peacock, which I guess the genius who wrote the article thinks automatically means we are all subscribers, because that's how it works, is terrible.

The only thing that could make this new hell worse is adding more internet providers and ending the cable/phone company duopoly. 

&#x200B;

I do wonder who paid for that article because with cable companies now entering the streaming game I'm not sure which agenda it helps. Actually, I don't really care. I'm going back to binge watching Hunters on Prime"
Skin Wars: Fresh Paint,"This has to be a joke, right? By no possible measure is streaming worse than cable. 

And like I always say, if it's not worth it for you, it's as simple as not subscribing."
Skin Wars: Fresh Paint,"I actually like to compare the ""streaming wars"" to the console wars. Streaming will do to movie theaters what consoles did to arcades. And streaming technology will advance technology and its influence will be felt beyond the services themselves. E.g. If it wasn't for Sega channel in the 90's clearing the nation's coax networks up in preperation for their service, we wouldn't have broadband internet.

Like consoles, who had to stand out on the basis of content they were generating, the streaming service will have to generate more original content to compete.

Back in the 80's, consoles came from everywhere much like how every company had a streaming service. But because that's not sustainable, only a few will survive. In 10 years we'll have ""the big 3"" like we see with consoles now.

Follow the console gaming model and you'll see a blueprint for where this is all going."
Skin Wars: Fresh Paint,"This is another example of people not reading the article. It makes a whole host of good points. Namely that while the streaming wars may seem like a good alternative, the lack of net neutrality is going to lead to a future mess. Not to mention that a lot of these streaming services are going to use increased piracy (due to exclusives) to push forth a whole host of annoying restrictions - and a lot of these streaming companies are attached to companies that own ISPs that things are going to get even more messier without net neutrality protections."
Skin Wars: Fresh Paint,"It is hell because I can't get everything I want, in exactly the way I want, at a price I want.

Also I still want to complain about 1) price is too high; 2) VC vultures artificially suppress prices before IPO; 3) too many players; 4) not enough competition; 5) everything else."
Skin Wars: Fresh Paint,Im one of the few that actually likes cable. Im just going to keep channel surfing and hope this streaming war blows over.
Skin Wars: Fresh Paint,"I agree, but you have to factor in the cost of your internet as well."
Skin Wars: Fresh Paint,"People keep bleating about it being cable all over again, but what do they actually want instead?

One service that has every film and show ever for a few dollars a month? Sounds realistic guys."
Skin Wars: Fresh Paint,"Streaming wars is just code for capitalism working as intended for once because there is no monopoly. Yes, they are competing with each other, we, the customers, win when that happens."
Skin Wars: Fresh Paint,"Ugh but I can't manage 4 streaming subscriptions at once, way too much to handle, oh well I guess I'm totally justified in pirating everything until one streaming service locks in a monopoly and lets me watch any movie ever made for $8.99/month."
Skin Wars: Fresh Paint,"Yeah, I agree. I can't stomach live TV. Its like one long commercial broken up by shows. Its maddening how people just sit there and let all that advertising sink into their skulls."
Skin Wars: Fresh Paint,"No, it is not a joke."
Skin Wars: Fresh Paint,"The irony is, if you look at where the console industry is likely headed - it's a model that looks a lot like the current streaming ecosystem. Companies are more interested in getting people into an ecosystem than having them buy a specific box/format, and see a $15/mo subscription as more valuable than traditional console ownership with occasional game purchases. Game Pass on Xbox is effectively the model of early Netflix - open access to a library of games licenced from third parties, propped up by big exclusives. And like Netflix, it's at risk of those third parties (namely EA & Ubisoft) building their own subscription service rather than participating in an existing one."
Skin Wars: Fresh Paint,"> Back in the 80's, consoles came from everywhere much like how every company had a streaming service. But because that's not sustainable, only a few will survive. In 10 years we'll have ""the big 3"" like we see with consoles now.

This is an absolutely insane oversimplification of the video game crash. Trying to graft the trends and downfall of the pre-Nintendo video game market to modern day streaming is completely pointless. No one is dropping $50 on a cartridge to watch CBS All-Access' original drama E.T.: The Video Game."
Skin Wars: Fresh Paint,"> This is another example of people not reading the article.

Yeah, the, ""I *love* streaming, you're crazy!"" comments obviously belie complete ignorance of what the author actually wrote. It's never surprising but always disappointing."
Skin Wars: Fresh Paint,"do you?

even if I gave up on TV I'd still be using the internet every day"
Skin Wars: Fresh Paint,"I see that a lot too, people are focusing just on the total cost of having all of these services and the ignore the different business model. Just being able to unsubscribe at anytime means it won't be like cable.

Meanwhile we're getting a lot of content that probably never gets produced in the old network TV/Cable world."
Skin Wars: Fresh Paint,"The point of the article though was not that there are multiple streaming services, but that ISPs will start throttling other competitor services and it's going to be shady as shit and we need net neutrality like now."
Skin Wars: Fresh Paint,"Most people DVR stuff and don’t even watch it live.   Plus when my wife is watching something love or I’m watching sports, I check my phone or let the dogs out or check on the kids during commercials.  Couldn’t even tell you one commercial I’ve seen in the last week.  Not one"
Skin Wars: Fresh Paint,They do it because they're used to it. We've been watching TV that's 1/3 commercials for so long that it's just normal. Thankfully streaming is making that less normal.
Skin Wars: Fresh Paint,And look at Google Stadia and GeForce now. Streaming in general mixed with cloud access is taking an interesting turn.
Skin Wars: Fresh Paint,"I am oversimplifying because it's complicated. However, I'm not wrong. Eventually CBS all access and others like it won't be able to sustain demand for their service and instead will have to publish directly to larger streaming platforms. Atari and Sega used to be console platforms but now publish directly through larger platforms."
Skin Wars: Fresh Paint,My VCR still marks all commercials and automatically skips them on play.
Skin Wars: Fresh Paint,Somebody is watching it or they wouldn't be doing it.
Skin Wars: Fresh Paint,I started watched a show on Hulu (which I got through my paid Disney+ subscription) and I would say it's still roughly 1/4 unskippable ads and 3/4 show. And the worst part is the streaming commercials are terrible and you see the same 5 over and over again.
Skin Wars: Fresh Paint,"> My VCR

You from 1995??"
Skin Wars: Fresh Paint,"tl;dr: Where's the child in the sequel trilogy?

This article is premature at best. That's such an obvious question that it's pretty much impossible for the producers *not* to have planned for. If the season/series concludes without resolving that, sure, this would be fair criticism. Pointing this out now is like saying ""Peter Jackson needs to solve his Gollum problem"" halfway through Fellowship."
Skin Wars: Fresh Paint,Wow...that article makes some horrible leaps on logic and ignores principles that are cannon (as well as thinking that force users are only either jedi or sith in the first place).
Skin Wars: Fresh Paint,"Yea this guy is full of shit ! Its two episodes in and i have no idea when the show is set which is perfect for the feel of the show. Its a western with lazer beams. The fact the guy has a baby ""yoda""  might mean its before all that shit (episodes 1-1000000) but that dosent discredit the show from being its own thing."
Skin Wars: Fresh Paint,"or maybe...its a gigantic galaxy, and its possible for these people to never meet lol"
Skin Wars: Fresh Paint,The problem this article mentions is probably at least a century off in the show's timeline.
Skin Wars: Fresh Paint,"I give no F**ks about timeline atm, big galaxy is big. Case in point, what happened to ezra and thrawn during all this time of movies 4-now. What happened to Ahsoka Tano during movies 4-now? These were 2 highly notable force users just poofed, all we know was that the ghost was in Rogue one and was around after the battle of Endor (wtb update on Syndulla and possible [Spoiler](#s ""Force using child of Syndulla/Jarrus""). Plus, the writers already broke Star wars lore during Star Wars Rebels with [Spoiler](#s ""the World between worlds time traveling, universe traveling force dimension"").

I'm highly enjoying the show so far. My main wish for the show is that I want to see his armor get gradually fully replaced with shiny new beskar."

Skin Wars: Fresh Paint,"It's a stupid concern to have this early in the series. People had the same criticism of Kanan and Ezra being there for the beginnings of the Rebellion, but not during the OT. Guess what? As the series was wrapping up the reasons Kanan and Ezra weren't there for the rest of it were answered!"
Skin Wars: Fresh Paint,Aside from Dog the bounty hunter this is the best bounty hunter  show out there
Skin Wars: Fresh Paint,"If I didn't already know, I'd have no clue what time period this is set in...so I agree. Its terrific regardless."
Skin Wars: Fresh Paint,"It's close (I'd surmise within a few years) after the fall of the Empire (note the dialog about imperial credits in s01) and before the First Order nonsense. The baby is just form Yoda's species, which is not described or noted anywhere in cannon (pre or post Disney) -- so that changes the feel of it just a bit from might-be-yoda to not-yoda.

I agree, though, that it's great to see a story that's different and smaller. This feels like someone cares about the story, something I haven't gotten from anything else Ditzy, er, Disney has done to the franchise."
Skin Wars: Fresh Paint,"Wait this is supposed to be between the original trilogy and the new movies, right?  That's gotta only be like 25-30 years"
Skin Wars: Fresh Paint,"Yeah, that kid is very much still gonna be a kid well into the sequel trilogy. Perfectly reasonable that he's not in the picture yet."
Skin Wars: Fresh Paint,"the species is called YODAS SPECIES. they did have a female ""Yaddle"" but thats literally it. Star Wars creator George Lucas chose to keep the name and background of Yoda's species a mystery.[12] Both Yoda's and Yaddle's Databank entries on StarWars.com list their species as ""Unknown but basically hes an elf.  so having a ""yoda baby"" is a cluster fuck of mystery."
Skin Wars: Fresh Paint,"Yeah, but think of the aging rate. The ""infant"" is explicitly 50 years old. At what point is he actually an adult? 200?"
Skin Wars: Fresh Paint,"Would you rather the McGuffin be safe and boring?  Mando had my curiosity, but Yeetle is the hook that has my attention."
Skin Wars: Fresh Paint,"If he's powerful enough to do the stuff he does in the second episode despite being an ""infant"", that power should be presumably enough to alert force users like Snoke or Kylo Ren to his presence"
Skin Wars: Fresh Paint,"It wasn't that much, though. He lifted up an animal, and it was enough to knock him out for hours. He's also way, way out on the frontier. They might have felt a flash, but there's no reason to think that this is some enormous change in the status quo."
Skin Wars: Fresh Paint,You can't just sense force users multiple systems away unless you torch a planet or something.  Vader was right by tatooine and didn't think anything of it.

Skin Wars: Fresh Paint,"I’m gonna try to link it here but Tony Gilroy addressed what you’re talking about and why he chose to make the episodes slower even when Disney pushed back and wanted him to make the 1st episodes more “exciting”.

[Tony Gilroy Interview](https://i.redd.it/tony-gilroy-addresses-the-people-that-call-andor-slow-and-v0-mevhg1hfbf2a1.jpg?auto=webp&s=6ed5bb6c9896cef10c9f2a4e105a76cb7debefb1)

Its absolutely the right move here especially cause we know the fate of this character and we need to be invested in the character and not the plot.  We know the plot.   

We’ve been so conditioned with shows recently both SW and Marvel and really everything else that we should want plot first Big Bang right out of the first episode then character later.  To flip that and put character first is so refreshening.  It could only happen in SW shows like this because of its built in audience.  If most shows these days started like Andor started people would tune out and not push through and that would be the end of the show."
Skin Wars: Fresh Paint,"I am not calling it the most fun Star Wars can be, but it is the most moving, most thought provoking, most layered, well acted Star Wars has ever been. I have thought and watched more on it than any show this year. It did not engage you. It happens."
Skin Wars: Fresh Paint,"I finished last night and I loved it.  Cass's journey was epic over one season.  The fact that the whole prison storyline even took place within a season is amazing to me.  This is one of my favorite shows of the last five years solely for the fact that it exposed so much more every day life within the star wars universe.  Seeing coruscant, ferrix, and aldhani culture was amazing and add in the fact it was attached to what I consider a damn good story is the icing on the cake."
Skin Wars: Fresh Paint,"The fact you think rise of Skywalker is better than last jedi kinda says all you need to know

EDIT: Rian Johnson didn't kill your childhood and he made a pretty solid movie with the only shred of originality that the Disney movies have pumped out"
Skin Wars: Fresh Paint,I’m sorry you had this experience. It’s OK to have different reactions to art.
Skin Wars: Fresh Paint,"It is hard for me to imagine being so into Star Wars and not liking Andor… it is so much more multidimensional and thought provoking than it’s predecessors. To me it is Star Wars for adults. While past Star Wars toys with the notion that things aren’t always so black and white - Andor approaches the topic head on. 

For a prequel show where the MC and several others have plot armor, they insert constant tension. Luthen is already a top 10 Star Wars character to me and he could climb even higher. I’m already hoping for a triple prequel Luthen backstory series."
Skin Wars: Fresh Paint,"It's okay that you didn't like it. It's absolutely a masterpiece compared to everything else Disney has offered for the Star Wars franchise, but that doesn't mean everyone has to enjoy it. I worked with a guy years ago whose favorite movie was Michael Bay's Transformers. He didn't care that it was objectively dumb because it was fun. Maybe you just prefer a fun viewing experience to a well-crafted and layered story. No shame in that. 

Although i will say when I hear people complain that it's boring, I wonder if they were even paying attention. Without giving away context for spoilers, you have a double homicide, a failed capture by authorities, a 'bank' heist, thieves double crossing each other, a prison break, and a clash between authorities and an oppressed group. I guess it needed a lightsaber fight to have some action?"
Skin Wars: Fresh Paint,This isn’t a Star Wars show. It’s a great show that happens to be set in the Star Wars Universe.
Skin Wars: Fresh Paint,"If you’re someone who thinks The Last Jedi is the ***only*** other bad Star Wars media, I don’t think Andor is the problem here lol"
Skin Wars: Fresh Paint,"Nothing happened to Mon Mothma?  She committed her daughter to the same horrible life that she has?  For Mothma everything happened!  We learn about her as a character and not just as someone who showed up one time in New Hope.

Also my best part of reading your post was that you found the show boring with the exception of the prison break, Mothma and the finale.  So you basically disliked half the show only?  I guess you kind of missed the point of jab jab uppercut that the writer was going for.

Look man if it's not your speed that's ok.  There's plenty of low hanging fruit in the star wars lore to enjoy.  Slow chase scenes through forests, cartoonist escapes from imperial facilities, characters that are never given any sort of motivation for their actions.  So enjoy what you will, but Andor is quite possibly the greatest star wars has been in quite a long time.  Clone wars is 7 seasons just to build to the incredible ending of the Siege of Mandalore."
Skin Wars: Fresh Paint,"I stopped reading after they claimed the last Jedi was the *only* other SW project the disliked and said it was the worst film.  Sure I wasn’t crazy about everything they did in that movie but it’s definitely *not* worse than the utter garbage that was Rise of Skywalker and Attack of the Clones.  On the tv show side Book of Boba Fett was an absolute dumpster fire and made me actually *dislike* a character I’ve loved since I was 5 years old.

What I’m getting at is, while everyone is entitled to their own opinion, OP has terrible taste."
Skin Wars: Fresh Paint,Is Reddit’s homepage sorting by controversial now or something? Feels like hot take r/television posts keep popping up at the top for me.
Skin Wars: Fresh Paint,Bro wanted marvel cameos
Skin Wars: Fresh Paint, The stuff OP complains about is why we got stupid chase scenes in Obi-Wan and Boba fett that didn’t lead anywhere or develop the plot….
Skin Wars: Fresh Paint,If you didn’t like it after ep 3 then why continue lol
Skin Wars: Fresh Paint,Lost me at its boring.  Sorry.
Skin Wars: Fresh Paint,"Lots of people like crazy action sequences with no depth type shows. Some of the most popular TV is reality TV, some of the highest grossing movies are about people driving fast cars with dumb stunts. There's nothing wrong with enjoying action packed stuff. 

Andor is not that. It's a show that shows the delicate balance when being a spy. It shows the horrors of fascism and how it warps those who think they are the heroes into committing horrible acts. It's a spy show with quiet deceit, careful planning, and flawed execution. About why people rebel, and why those who ferment rebellion are grey and can sometimes be the villain. How even those who commit atrocities can love and are at their hearts human.

If you can't appreciate that, I honestly feel a little bad, because it's very beautiful. Star Wars the originals always had a tight rope to walk, because it's action packed, but there are deeper stories to be told. Sons trying to heal father's wounds, fear leading you to bring about your doom. 

Honestly though, if you watched the prequels and sequels and thought ""these are good moves"" I can't take anything you say seriously. The prequels are dumpster fires of movie making. The dialogue is horrendous, and the acting worse. There's so much useless fluff (which appeals to children, the way cocomelon is dumb garbage, but kids love it). The sequels have no plot that makes any sense, and TRoS is the worst of them because it rewrites the entire point of the original trilogy. 

So to cap off my long thing, that's fine you didn't like it, but I would try to broaden your horizons a bit. There's lots of deep slow pacing things that don't hit your dopamine receptors, but are worth it to savor."
Skin Wars: Fresh Paint," I’m a lifelong SW fan, and at 47, it means I’ve consumed all the movies in theaters in real time. Learning to adapt to the new world order with so much new and mostly good content takes so much time. As a result, I’ve “picked and choosed” my way through all these limited series. 

With that as a brief context, I loved everything about Andor. The pacing, the cinematic quality. It felt so right to me. I binged watched over a vacation, staying up until 2 am and 3 am on consecutive nights. 

I totally understand how people would assess this as slow. Many of my good friends with common tastes to mine lost interest before finishing it. For me, Andor is the Godfather 1 of the SW universe. Just perfect."
Skin Wars: Fresh Paint,Here for my obligatory downvote… OP missed the mark on this one
Skin Wars: Fresh Paint,"It’s human drama in the Star Wars Universe.  It’s not trench runs or lightsabers or pod races.  I LOVE those things.  But I also enjoy HBO dramas about real people dealing with real problems.  I like understanding the actual human motivation to rebel against a totalitarian state.  You kinda have to let go of Star Wars to appreciate the show, but then realize how much the show actually enhances the Star Wars franchise that we love.  It’s a big universe with lots of stories."
Skin Wars: Fresh Paint,[removed]
Skin Wars: Fresh Paint,"It’s certainly much less an action centered show than other Star Wars shows tend to be, I’ll give you that. If you’re just not into drama and characters, I can see how you would be bored. To me it has a more GoT pace and style, multiple interconnected characters and sub-plots. If you understand why that style wildly popular, maybe you can see why other people would find Andor a good show, even if it didn’t resonate with you."
Skin Wars: Fresh Paint,"Your they type to enjoy *Goodfellas*, but wouldn’t be able to sit through *The Godfather*. I don’t say this to in a bad way. All I’m saying is there’s a certain type of show that you enjoy, but *Andor* ain’t it."
Skin Wars: Fresh Paint,"Understandable that it wasn’t your cup of tea - it seems like you prefer driving action tempo, and Andor was not that.  As an older person, there were A LOT of the more mundane elements that resonated deeply with me, and those may not have resonated with a younger person who hasn’t experienced the cruel judgement of a loving parent, the the mundanity of bureaucracy stifling a burning passion, the oppression of a self serving and corrupt boss, and so many other elements.  All good."
Skin Wars: Fresh Paint,Lmao of course someone who hates TLJ dislikes the best Star Wars media since TLJ came out.
Skin Wars: Fresh Paint,"It's ok if you don't like good shows, to each their own"
Skin Wars: Fresh Paint,"They set the show up to be similar to how TCW did things, with 3 episode arcs. That’s why it was very up and down. It was definitely slow but had some of the best character development in the universe in my opinion. Episodes 4-6 in Aldhani were excellent because it was really showing Andor start to get with the Rebellion. 

They pretty much had to set up a whole new universe because Star Wars fans expect to see Bounty Hunters, Lightsabers, and the Force in everything. I love how they are expanding to non-force storylines. 

Also the best part of Andor was definitely the prison break. But I think that is great for more than just Serkis and his amazing acting. You can see that he was scared to escape because I think he knew all along he was not gonna be able to escape. And that sacrifice builds the entire character arc of Andor willing to sacrifice himself in Rogue One. 

This was far and away the best material SW has released in a while. Happy new year!"
Skin Wars: Fresh Paint,"I mean some people like Ewoks and Jar Jar. To each their own. I vehemently disagree with OP, but it's fine that's his opinion."
Skin Wars: Fresh Paint,"Nah, OP. Andor was subtle mature and awesome. I get it that you like space wizards more but Andor is for people looking for a deeper story in StarWars."
Skin Wars: Fresh Paint,"I think the main issue is how you ended up watching the show.  If you already knew what was going to happen in episodes 1-5, I can see it being a slog to get through.  But on the first watch, if you’re not over-tired, the show was gripping.  No surprise that the better episodes for you were when you were watching it for the first time.  First show in a LONG time that I looked forward to watching every week."
Skin Wars: Fresh Paint,"I can understand why some would find it slow and boring, and at times it was definitely slow, but I think that is because we came from a lens of previous Star Wars content. Star Wars doesn't need to be fast and exciting in every piece of content, but since most of the content is fast and exciting we expect all Star Wars content to be as such and we find it weird when it is not. 

Personally, I enjoyed the change of pace and mindset."
Skin Wars: Fresh Paint,"There’s always going to be a better or worse character developed line. I’m just happy as a pig in mud that they are making multiple derivative character shows that I am entirely ok with it not being “The Best”. You’ve got the single episode excitement with Mando, you’ve got some character background on Kenobi, I liked Fett, think it needed some more work - but really - we have more episodes and movies, and that’s awesome. Go at it open minded, and you won’t be let down."
Skin Wars: Fresh Paint,Idk if this will be buried but was anyone intrigued by the manifesto ? I would love to read it fully or a version of it
Skin Wars: Fresh Paint,Slower is better for me. I like to live in a world and see how it functions. What comes to mind is The Assassination of Jesse James. It’s a Western that lets you feel what it’s like to live in the world.
Skin Wars: Fresh Paint,"Thanks for giving it a watch, at least.  I guess I'm more of a worldbuilding and character-driven fan.  I don't need or want SW to be all about action sequences.  Although when they happened (much more rarely than with other SW series) it made me enjoy them all the more."
Skin Wars: Fresh Paint,"I watched the entire season in one day. I was hooked. I might watch it again. I think your too used to action movies and shows. We all have our tastes, personally I'm not a huge action fan. I like shows like andor. Where you can discuss the characters, their motivations, and where they come from. Every character is well done. There isn't a single character that didn't do a good job. Which is surprising. Also, you may notike it. But, star wars needed a show like this. It finally introduced new characters instead of using cameos. Star wars ip was/is on life support. Merchandise sales are down, and Disney has ruined the ip. Andor is bringing it back slowly. It won't have everything people want. But that's fine. We shouldn't try and have shows that cater to every demographic. That's why we got awful movies and shows that are too spread out. Obi wan was a travesty. And mandalorian was a good show in what it offered. But it didn't introduce too many characters. We'll see more shows with good action. I hope they make some shows in the high republix. That will be good sith vs Jedi."
Skin Wars: Fresh Paint,"You're inability to enjoy Andor for what it is and your dislike of The Last Jedi are linked here, I think."
Skin Wars: Fresh Paint,Star Wars is only relevant because of fan service. Andor was refreshing to me because it did its job not relying on fan service too much.
Skin Wars: Fresh Paint,Can I get your opinion on Kenobi?
Skin Wars: Fresh Paint,"I think it’s important to understand that this show was not meant to follow the blueprint of how the movies were written and filmed. This show effectively expressed the sacrifices that humans make during times of suppression and violence from cynical and authoritarian governments like the republic. I feel like it was beautifully presented, but if you didn’t feel the same then to each their own. I like hearing how each person does or does not like a specific TV show or movie because that’s the beauty of free speech. Hope you find a show you like!"
Skin Wars: Fresh Paint,"That's unfortunate. This is probably the most negative review I've seen given to Andor. The pacing was something I personally enjoyed very much. I do agree that it wasn't perfect, but for me the maturity of the series is way beyond the movies and also any if the series, which I personally like non of, besides mentioned Andor."
Skin Wars: Fresh Paint,"I wasn't enjoying Andor until I decided to ignore it's a Star Wars tv show. As soon as I started to consider the show as a political drama that tells its own story independent from the franchise, that's when Andor became an amazing series. Now I can't wait for a second season."
Skin Wars: Fresh Paint,Everyone who didn’t like the show is rightwing politically. Only half joking.
Skin Wars: Fresh Paint,Slow buildup and increased exposition is my personal favorite characteristic of a TV show or movie. This just wasn’t for you
Skin Wars: Fresh Paint,"You have bad taste, man. Sorry."
Skin Wars: Fresh Paint,It's the best written Star Wars project. Hands down. I'll die on this hill. Fight me.
Skin Wars: Fresh Paint,Best Star Wars series so far. It’s a masterpiece. It’s been a literal war in the stars.
Skin Wars: Fresh Paint,"Possess bad taste you do

Grow up you must"
Skin Wars: Fresh Paint,"It’s possible you were disappointed that there were no light sabers (clone wars, obi wan, etc), no using the force (prequels, sequels) or baby yodas.   I’m not being sarcastic.  I think some fans find extracting creativity from the original source to be fun and nostalgic.  Unfortunately for me, I find it very unimaginative and it made the prequels and sequels very painful to watch.  This is why I loved rogue one and Andor bc they truly went beyond the source material.  Andor did even less recycling and completely built intricacies of the Star Wars world we never could appreciate.  What did it feel like working under the empire?  The actual feeling of oppression in your day to day life?  Sure blowing up planets is threatening but it’s distant and abstract.  Also to see the rebellion as a secretive ragtag group of misfits is a completely different angle from all other films, except perhaps the early portrayal of Han Solo in New Hope.    

Andor also has a powerful and sharp script with flawless acting (the acting in Obi Wan was awful).  The storyline is brilliant on a whole different level because they pace it and build their characters."
Skin Wars: Fresh Paint,"I totally agree. Relative to other recent Star Wars series, it’s really good. Relative to other really good television, it’s meh."
Seven and Me,You played Charlie Cox’s dad in Stardust. Can we extrapolate this data to assume that Billy Russo is the father of Daredevil?
Seven and Me,Not about Shadow and Bone but I loved you in The Punisher as Russo. If you were given the chance would you return to the MCU? Thanks!
Seven and Me,Can you please stop dying? I'm traumatized every single time
Seven and Me,"Hi Ben!

First, you're amazing in concert, I saw your first show in LA and loved it!

Second, I wanted to ask - we've seen Freddy fully embrace the Kazzle Dazzle name. I've seen The Darkling referred to as ""Darkle Sparkle."" I was hoping that you'd see this and the next time you and Freddy post things together, maybe you can refer to yourselves as Kazzle Dazzle and Darkle Sparkle just once?"
Seven and Me,"Mr. Barnes, can you tell us a happy memory about Narnia?"
Seven and Me,"Greetings Benjamin, I just want to know the name of The Darkling’s horse—if there’s no official name, I want to know what YOU think it would be. Thx"
Seven and Me,"Does Leigh Bardugo work closely with the show and if so, how is it working with her? She seems really involved when I check out her Instagram and seems like she has a great relationship with the cast."
Seven and Me,"I've been in love with you since I watched you in Prince Caspian and Stardust when I was 12 years old. So ummmm will you marry me?

Just kidding. My question is, are you a Neil Gaiman fan? What other books do you enjoy?"
Seven and Me,What is your favourite type of cheese ? 🧀
Seven and Me,What comes natural to you.... Playing A Bad Guy or Playing a good guy? And Why?
Seven and Me,"Do you, as a person, think the Darkling is redeemable?"
Seven and Me,"I have two for you Ben
1. How would you describe The Darkling’s feelings regarding the women he’s impacted in the series ie Alina, Zoya, Genya, Baghra
2. Have you, at any point in your life, read fanfiction about a certain long haired, convicted murderer that turns into a dog at will and his friend group whilst they were at school?"
Seven and Me,Could you spoil one of the lines that you managed to sneak in this season? 🤧🤧🤧
Seven and Me,DROP THE SKINCARE ROUTINE!!
Seven and Me,How did you and Jessie Mei Li develop such great chemistry?? You guys sizzle on screen and seem like lovely friends off screen!
Seven and Me,what music/album do you think fits the Darkling and his story?
Seven and Me,"Hi, now I feel guilty for not watching S&B yet."
Seven and Me,Hi. Thank you for doing this! Hope you’re having a great week. The Polygon interview just got released so I’m wondering if you can share what your ideal rom com role is?
Seven and Me,Which order of Grisha do you most align with?
Seven and Me,"What was your experience like working with Zoe Wanamaker? Did you share a mother-son sort of relationship off cameras (if so, how many times did she hit your leg with her stick) or was the relationship like coworkers."
Seven and Me,"Hey hi! if the darkling had a signature scent, what would it be?"
Seven and Me,hello! how different was to play darklina scenes this season rather then the previous one?
Seven and Me,What is your favourite book in SaB series?
Seven and Me,which character you wish the darkling had more scenes with?
Seven and Me,From the six crows which one would you most likely be friends with?
Seven and Me,What's the scene you're the proudest of?
Seven and Me,What would be The Darkling’s favorite stuffed animal???
Seven and Me,"If you could swap characters with your co-cast, who would you want to swap with?"
Seven and Me,which episode of season 2 would you say is your favorite?
Seven and Me,Are you working on any new music soon?
Seven and Me,"I first know about you as Prince Caspian and since then I’ve watched you as Logan in Westworld, Jigsaw in Punisher and Darkling in S&B. 

My question is, which type of characters do you prefer playing? The dark ones or the nice ones?"
Seven and Me,"If you could have any quote or icon from The Grishaverse tattooed on you, what would it be and why?"
Seven and Me,"You play fantastic heels in Shadow and Bone and Westworld. Will we see good guy Ben Barnes anytime soon? 

Also your long hair look is #goals for me. Any tips?"
Seven and Me,Have u ever read the picture of Dorian Gray
Seven and Me,#RUSSO!!!
Seven and Me,What was it like being an audiobook narrator for The Lives of Saints and The Demon in the Wood for Leigh Bardugo? Was it a new experience? What was your favorite part?
Seven and Me,"Hey! Great to have you here! I have following questions:

The darkling looks much older in the show than in the books (even though he is hundreds of years old in the books too). Dont get me wrong, you are a great cast for him! In the books he is as old as Alina, how do you think changes that ""up-ageing"" their relationship? 

And: are the costumes comfortable? Sometimes the keftas look kinda stiff and I am wondering about the scar make up too!

Cant wait seeing you all on screen soon again!"
Seven and Me,"bin bons???? 

but in all seriousness, your performance as the darkling is truly insane- you bring so much nuance to this character while still making it clear that his actions are just.. awful. i remember growing up watching you play prince caspain too, so i guess my question is, who are your favourite literary heroes and villains? (p.s. i LOVE that you're an anna karenina fan too!)"
Seven and Me,"Since your have parents come from a fantastic professional mental health background, I wonder how they reacted to your roles of being an absolute psychopath. Did your parents ever recommended you to therapy looking at your immense sense of intrigue towards recently portraying a villain."
Seven and Me,Not a question but you're great in Cabinet of Curiosities on Netflix.
Seven and Me,"Hi Ben!! Thank you for taking the time to answer fan questions on here. 

We know that you and Jessie watched Jane Eyre to prepare for the first season :) Did you do anything in particular with Jessie to prepare for Darklina scenes in the second season?"
Seven and Me,"Hi 🥰
Can you tell us a bit about your experience with narrating audiobooks? Do you have any vocal warm ups you follow and how do you prepare for a day of recording? 

do you ever mess up or are you just (annoyingly) perfect

MUCH LOVE"
Seven and Me,What was your favorite scene to film as Billy Russo in The Punisher?
Seven and Me,did any of your s&b castmates fangirl over you the first you met them? haha
Seven and Me,"Hi Ben!!! 

What would you say a typical filming day looks like for you? Any *rituals* or specifics you do before starting a scene or starting your day overall? 

❤️❤️❤️"
Seven and Me,"What is the one project you've done that you'd suggest to someone who's never watched your work, that you think summarizes best what you are/represent as an actor? ❤️"
Seven and Me,"If the show is renewed for season 3, do you think that you would feel comfortable returning as the Darkling (if/when he's killed off, if/when they go the resurrection route) considering that they massacred the S1 development and backstory of the character in favour of making Aleksander the scapegoat for the systemic oppression of the Grisha in S2?

You added a lot of humanity to the character and elevated him from a one-dimensional villain to a fallible human just desperate to save his people from persecution. From the S2 trailer, it seems that they just want to erase all of that work. Whether you step down or not, thank you for all you've done to give the Darkling depth and growth.

PS If they cast for a young Darkling to do any Demon in the Wood flashbacks, might you recommend Louis Partridge? He's perfect for younger you, even if you are ageless and immortal.  


Much love,

a fellow English degree nerd"
Seven and Me,How do you feel about the way the show handles the Darkling & Alina’s relationship/dynamic in the second season? Super excited to see it!
Seven and Me,"What was your favorite part about shooting for Season 2? Were there moments from the books that you were craving to do or new characters you were excited to meet? 

Also: you’ve played characters that come from books before; what makes Shadow and Bone stand out as another literary adaptation for you?"
Seven and Me,"In season 1 there were hints of the Grisha being an oppressed minority and you spoke about it in some interviews, but I have not seen this mentioned so far in any season 2 interview…did season 2 ignore how the Grisha were persecuted for hundreds of years before the Darkling lived???"
Seven and Me,"As a long-time Shadow and Bone fan its exciting to see the characters come to life on screen, especially the Darkling!

Is there any aspect of the book version of the Darkling that you've primarily kept in mind while acting as him? Thanks!"
Seven and Me,"Hi Ben, I'm rewatching Season 1 just now and I have to say it's still one of the greatest show on Netflix and your performance is brilliant.

Q: How does it feel to be the villain in Shadow and Bone?

I can't wait to watch Season 2."
Seven and Me,"Hi Ben! Hope you’re doing well! My question is, what is your favourite thing about playing the Darkling? Is there a particular aspect of his character you find the most interesting or fun to explore? Thanks! 🖤"
Seven and Me,"Hi Ben, you don't know how excited I am to have you back as The Darkling believe me this wait has seemed like an eternity haha. I know that you will have many questions to answer and I hope you can answer some of the ones that I am going to leave you:  
  
***1.- What was your biggest challenge that you faced in the recording of this second season?***  
***2.- What is your favorite dialogue of this second season?***  
***3.- This is not a question, I just wanted to tell you that if you keep giving shows I really hope you can come to Mexico to give even one show.***  
  
And I don't want to miss the opportunity to tell you how much ***I love you***, in fact you have been with me practically all my life since I met you in Narnia and I hope to have the opportunity to meet you in person very soon, I love you, I love you, I love you and ***I am very proud of you. XOXOXO***"
Seven and Me,"Which role is the most challenging for you so far, and why?"
Seven and Me,Whos your favorite shadow and bone cast member to work with?
Seven and Me,"If you were born in Ketterdam alongside the other crows, what job do you think you would do in the gang?"
Seven and Me,"Can you tell us your personal favorite episode of season 2? And any hope for Darklina fans??

On a side note, pretty ptlretty please do a fan convention in the US. (with a cherry on top)"
Seven and Me,How do you prepare for more intimate scenes like the kissing scene with Jessie?
Seven and Me,will we get more Alina and Darkling content?
Seven and Me,Would the darkling listen to Taylor Swif?
Seven and Me,"Hello from Italy 🤗
What are you favourite memories from shooting Shadow and Bone season 2?
I really love all your performances and I'm so looking forward to see the new season just because you're in it. Lots of love xx"
Seven and Me,"Hello Ben! I have been a longtime fan of the series, and I love the nuance you bring to the Darkling! Book Darkling could feel like a cartoon villain sometimes, but you play him with so much care that the viewer sympathizes enough to hate themselves for rooting for him. 

Do you think the Darkling really cares for Alina as a person? If so, does he care about her because of her powers, or because she is the only one as endless as he is? Or is she just a pawn to him? 

Much thanks for reading, can't wait for season 2!"
Seven and Me,"After shadow and bone, would you like to work with Jessie again? She's so talented, and you two work perfectly together."
Seven and Me,"Hi, you are amazing villain in Shadow and Bone. 
The Darkling is my most favorite character on the show.I'm so excited to watch season2.

You've played roles of villains/bad guys many times.
Your acting is just amazing. And you seem like a very nice person. How do you separate your work and your private life? Has playing villains affected your private life?

I also wanna know funny behind the scenes stories about Shadow and Bone.


Lastly, watching Shadow and Bone helped me get through when I was in my lowest point of life. Thank you for your amazing work and your costar's amazing work. The show is so special for me."
Seven and Me,"I had no idea who you were before I watched Shadow & Bone but I became a big fan of the show almost entirely because of your scenes. Also I'm jealous I'll never be able to pull off an all black outfit like you can.

Anyways, you've been an actor for a majority of your life.  What is a role you wished you would be asked about more and why?"
Seven and Me,How is playing the Darkling different or similar to your previous roles?
Seven and Me,"Hello Ben ! I’m excited to see you back in season 2 ! And by the way, you have such a lovely singing voice ! My question is : What would be your dream project/role ?"
Seven and Me,"Which episode from Season 2 is your favourite, and why? Also hi, love you <3"
Seven and Me,"Hello Ben!! Not including the Darkling, who is your favourite Grishaverse character?"
Seven and Me,what can you tell us about the darkest part of shadow and bone season 2?
Seven and Me,Tell us one darkling's line you included in season 2
Seven and Me,fav darklina moment from the books?
Seven and Me,"What have you taken from your time as the Darkling? Either physical set objects, lessons, etc"
Seven and Me,"besides your character, who's the most interesting character for this season ?"
Seven and Me,what's your favorite thing about Aleksander?
Seven and Me,Hi Ben! Please tell us whether we get any Darklina goodness in S2? 🖤
Seven and Me,"If you could make up another Grisha power, what would it be?"
Seven and Me,"hi ben, i'm rewatching s&b s1 rn and i love your performance more somehow. i remember the fandom basically going crazy when you were cast, was that an overwhelming response? did it make the role less or more daunting and you less or more nervous?"
Seven and Me,What was the most fun scene to film from season one?
Seven and Me,"Hi Ben! 

My question for you is: if you could put any of the other movie or tv characters you played in the past in the Grishaverse (to be a hero or a villain, your choice) who would you choose and why?"
Seven and Me,who do you think would be the darkling favorite author and why? 🫵🏻
Seven and Me,Hi Ben! I love seeing your appreciation for the grishaverse books and Leigh - do you have a favourite scene from the S&B trilogy and a favourite scene from the SoC duology? Cant wait for s2!
Seven and Me,"Even though you play the darkling (and amazingly at that), which shadow and bone character do you think is most similar to you?"
Seven and Me,"Hey Ben! Hope you're doing well.
I wanted to ask if you have any book recommendations, I trust your taste. Thank you! Can't wait to see Shadow and Bone on Thursday."
Seven and Me,What’s your favorite book in the Grishaverse?
Seven and Me,"hi! absolutely ecstatic for the release of season 2 and i was wondering if the grishaverse was real, what place would you choose to travel to?
i’d personally love to explore the jurda farms in novyi zem!"
Seven and Me,What's your favorite line from the upcoming season? 🥺
Seven and Me,How did you prepare for the audition as the Darkling??
Seven and Me,who is your favourite crow?
Seven and Me,"Hey Ben! 
just wondering .. if you could play any of the six crows, which one would you pick and why?
sending love <3"
Seven and Me,why is darkling such an emo crying baby
Seven and Me,What do you think about Jessie? 🙂
Seven and Me,"Hey Ben! You always seem like such a fun, loving nice guy in social media and interviews but seem to have a preference for playing bad guys (and wonderfully, I must say, I've loved your roles in Westworld and Shadow & Bone, but have been a fan since Narnia). Can you share with us why? I'm guessing it's because it's fun to pretend to be someone else, but I wondered if there are other reasons.

Also, revealing the Darkling's real name was a significant thing in the Siege & Storm book and a very memorable line from Alina in Ruin & Rising, but in the show it's mentioned very early in the story. Why the change?"
Seven and Me,"hello ben!!! i’ve been a fan since your narnia days, but your role as aleksander in s&b and the show in general has meant a lot to me—i was juggling an intense degree program and taking care of a family member pretty much alone when s1 came out, and it was an escape that brought me lots of joy and led me to some amazing friends. thank you for the passion and commitment you bring to your craft and all the roles you play! 

actual question time: who’s your favorite poet? are there any particular poems or lines of poetry that are (figuratively) forever engraved in your brain?"
Seven and Me,"Hello!!! 🥰🥰🥰 I have seen you first in  ”Dorian Gray”at the cinema, though I was young, in my early twenties, and though I even deeply hated the book, you have done an amazing job, even then! But I loved you in “Easy Virtue”! And I adore your album!  In this series, though you are more good-looking than what I have pictured reading the books, you are still rocking it because I totally despise your character 😆 like in the books! And that means A LOT!👏👏👏 since I consider you a super sweet and handsome man!   


MY QUESTION:

Did you tried other characters in the show before be assigned to the General Kirigan? Or did you choose to do that role? Or were you being contacted only for that character?   


thank you 🙏 

I wish you well and have a lovely evening!

😘😘😘"
Seven and Me,"hi bin bons, have you seen supernatural and would you ever consider working with jensen ackles?"
Seven and Me,"Do you think The Darkling is right about that the path he wants to follow is the best for Ravka? 
Because after reading Six of Crows and Crooked Kingdom I think that if The Darkling were ruling, the Grisha would never be THAT threatened."
Seven and Me,When can we see you and Andrew Garfield together on screen? Hopefully in a Comedy? Or any other genre.
Seven and Me,do you think the darkling and magneto would be friends
Power Rangers Ninja Steel,I hope they have a crossover with the ninja storm rangers or atleast reference them
Power Rangers Ninja Steel,"I still think it is criminal that they skipped adapting Power Rangers Rail Force! Sure the show was super weird, it was also far and away the funniest Power Rangers to date IMO, I think kids would have found it hilarious, and they could have sold a million [Ticket](http://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/powerrangers/images/f/f1/Still_ticket.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20140222115850) puppets"
Power Rangers Ninja Steel,"Dude, why do you assume all ninjas know each other?

Do you even know how many ninjas there are in the world?!"
Power Rangers Ninja Steel,"The original Japanese version had a crossover with the previous ninja based rangers.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfefkLMZMAQ"
Power Rangers Ninja Steel,"A battle between the pirate and ninja power rangers, with them uniting in the end, settling their difference, to fight whatever antagonist threatens them."
Power Rangers Ninja Steel,We prefer Ninja-American.
Power Rangers Ninja Steel,At least 5 
Power Rangers Ninja Steel,Ninja please.
Power Rangers Ninja Steel,[oh Ninja please](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wllN1i8bR2w)
Power Rangers Ninja Steel,That fight choreography was actually kinda good.
Power Rangers Ninja Steel,"""You're old, but I'm a robot, I'll never age!""

lmao"
Power Rangers Ninja Steel,God this brought back so much nostalgia from his costumes alone
Power Rangers Ninja Steel,the white power ranger costume is the best.
Power Rangers Ninja Steel,"Ok, that was awesome. Took me back. White Ranger was always my #1. Great low budget clone fight too. (Before the cg flying and shit that is) Just have him fight his stunt double. Film from the back. Film from the side in shadow. Then, costumes! "
Power Rangers Ninja Steel,"Man when he said Tommy hadn't been the Dino Thunder ranger in over 10 years, that really made me feel old. I remember that was the last season of Power Rangers I saw before I grew out of watching the series (for lack of a better term)."
Power Rangers Ninja Steel,Love it when they do cross-series cameos like this. My all time favorite is probably [Forever Red](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0qlRQ3EZLI&vl=en).
Power Rangers Ninja Steel,"I wonder if when he goes white ranger, if Saba is just like ""Oh gee!  Thanks so much for visiting, it's been years"""
Power Rangers Ninja Steel,Clearly they have way more original footage than they used to but are they still copying/splicing in a Japanese equivalent or have they gone 100% new content?
Power Rangers Ninja Steel,"""Alright everyone let's go. Where's Tommy?!""
""dunno""
""Okay no prob let's go""

They boogied out of there so fast and left him to potentially die, I'd be pissed. "
Power Rangers Ninja Steel,I met him earlier this year. All I can remember is that he looked really sad for some reason 
Power Rangers Ninja Steel,No Tommy as Turbo red? 
Power Rangers Ninja Steel,"So Tommy and Jason are the top two Power Rangers ever, right?"
Power Rangers Ninja Steel,"Uh, is this from a new series? I recognize a lot of the older actors, did they have a power rangers reunion? "
Power Rangers Ninja Steel,"Loved it.

Rockie, TJ and Kat too? Awesome."
Power Rangers Ninja Steel,Take that you heartless robot trash
Power Rangers Ninja Steel,Hey look Rocky isn't dead!
Power Rangers Ninja Steel,Holy hell. Green ranger all the way!!! That was my jam when I was a kid.
Power Rangers Ninja Steel,"Wish he would have busted out his Green Ranger flute. I still remember the song to call the Dragonzord. Tommy has always been the best. 25 years. It's insane that it's still going, and even more insane that I was there in the beginning as a 4-5 year old. Miss Beetleborgs too. Good times.

Also crazy that the 2nd Black Ranger is the English dub voice actor for a ton of the biggest anime hits. Vash, Ichigo and Lelouch to name a few. "
Power Rangers Ninja Steel,Guess they retconned his Turbo outfit.
Power Rangers Ninja Steel,"No, He did not do Turbo, so not every Ranger"
Power Rangers Ninja Steel,"Only thing that would of made that video better is if this song played when he Morphed into the White Ranger 

https://youtu.be/12lvu4YVV_w"
Power Rangers Ninja Steel,"Green was always the best, especially since the Dragon Zord came with a Green Ranger."
Power Rangers Ninja Steel,He's a better Megaforce ranger than the actual Megaforce rangers >.>
Power Rangers Ninja Steel,"Man, the feels seeing the White Ranger again..."
Power Rangers Ninja Steel,"As an original power ranger fan that grew out of it around turbo, that was pretty fucking badass"
Power Rangers Ninja Steel,Ahhh shit its the Green Ranger! 
Power Rangers Ninja Steel,"Was that a little bit of ""go go power rangers"" I heard in the background? "
Power Rangers Ninja Steel,So much nostalgia there. Green was always my favourite. Was kind of hoping he’d play the dagger flute thingy. 
Power Rangers Ninja Steel,Wtf is going on with this series? Are all of them connected? I watched the Megaforce event that had Tommy but no idea wtf was going on. I dont think I watched anything from the race car one up.
Power Rangers Ninja Steel,Haven’t watched Power Rangers in 20 years but that was kind of cool.
Power Rangers Ninja Steel,They missed the Turbo red  ranger 
Power Rangers Ninja Steel,Man. These kind of ideologies of anti AI/Tech/Humanoid Robots are going to age so bad in a few decades.  I think Dubai gave citizen right to an humanoid android recently. Times are changing quick it this will age just like racist comment in old shows did. Lol
Power Rangers Ninja Steel,Nostalgia up the ass
Power Rangers Ninja Steel,whoa gets kinda creepy at the end there
Power Rangers Ninja Steel,Man they should have rebooted the rangers as a tv series instead of movie. I would watch the shit out of this if it had interesting plots and characters.
Power Rangers Ninja Steel,He needs his soul patch and gel hair again.
Power Rangers Ninja Steel,He didn’t use one of the powers he has had before. 
Power Rangers Ninja Steel,What. The. Fuck? Is that actual sincere television? 
Power Rangers Ninja Steel,[deleted]
Power Rangers Ninja Steel,"Okay, the scene itself is really stupid but damn if I didn't get goosebumps when he turned into the white ranger!"
Power Rangers Ninja Steel,Can someone explain the plot for me? Are all the old Power Rangers back? Or are all the current Rangers adults rather than teenagers?
Power Rangers Ninja Steel,"Well, at least SABAN-rangers is consistent with their writing and over-acting. I recognize for many out there, MMPR and the entire medium is nostalgic and awesome - and I won't take that from you. 

However, when I saw Disney's treatments of Hurricanger (Ninja Storm?), AbaRanger (Dino Thunder), DekaRanger (SPD), MagiRanger (Mystic Force), and Boukenger (Operation Overdrive), I actually enjoyed the less campy, less over-acted characterizations and plots.

It made me delve into Super Sentai to see how it all measured up.

All I can say is this: if you like MMPR S1 (Zyuuranger) and S2 (DaiRanger), you really should ""compliment"" that with the originals as well. Think of them as ""alternate timelines"" so that you're not dealing with snobbery or ""originals were better"" crap. That's not my point. 

In ZyuuRanger alone, the background and story is so much more tragic - where Tommy only loses his Green Ranger power in MMPR, the Dragon Ranger is tragically the BROTHER of the Red Ranger, and dies - passing his powers to his surviving brother - who then seeks to avenge his brother's death. Oh, and the ""zords"" are sentient.

Hell, to this day, I still regard the [opening of DekaRanger](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kqFVvyKr6Q) to be one of the most infectious ear-worms..."
Power Rangers Ninja Steel,"I was never a huge Rangers fan (although I watched it for Amy Jo Johnson in spandex), but this was pretty awesome."
Power Rangers Ninja Steel,Are you sure thats not Nicholes Cage
Power Rangers Ninja Steel,"Oh, boy! More feeding JDF's ego!"
Power Rangers Ninja Steel,That was pretty good.  Check out the adult version its pretty hardcore 
Power Rangers Ninja Steel," #JesusDidntTap

What, a power ranger can't be a Christian? Sad.
"
Power Rangers Ninja Steel,"This show is still for kids, right?  That's an awful lot of old-looking people there."
Power Rangers Ninja Steel,"It makes me sad that as much as I love it, Iron Fist season 1 had worse choreography than a goddamn kids show..."
Power Rangers Ninja Steel,"Yeah, at first I was about to close it because of the cheesiness, but man some of those moves were pretty damn well done. Ended up watching the whole thing."
Power Rangers Ninja Steel,Exactly what I was going to say!
Power Rangers Ninja Steel,"Hes a martial artist, did MMA for a while and teaches martial arts."
Power Rangers Ninja Steel,"Instantly made me think about how bad Iron Fist’s was. 

Like... goddamn Power Rangers has better fight choreography than you. "
Power Rangers Ninja Steel,Their choreography improved a long time ago. The first time I noticed it was Wild Force.
Power Rangers Ninja Steel,this is such a powerranger line i love it :D
Power Rangers Ninja Steel,I dig it. When he went green ranger though I was like “wooaahhhh it’s 1992”
Power Rangers Ninja Steel,"That was definitely my favorite as a kid, loved the sword. "
Power Rangers Ninja Steel,[deleted]
Power Rangers Ninja Steel,"Shit, it's been at least twenty years for me. I remember when Tommy wasn't even a Ranger. Go Red Ranger!"
Power Rangers Ninja Steel,Watched that season as a whole. It was awesome seeing Tommy get the black ranger power 
Power Rangers Ninja Steel,"For real,

For me Dino Thunder is still a new season.


*checks facts* 

Out of 25 seasons....

Dino Thunder is 12th.

Fuck..."
Power Rangers Ninja Steel,"I grew out of it back when it was Ramgers in Space and felt old when I heard Tommy came back for Dino Thunder. 

Now it's even worse."
Power Rangers Ninja Steel,"God that was crazy, wasn’t it? I wasn’t into power rangers at that point but my brother was still a kid and was into it so I would watch the episodes with him. I can’t believe that was ten years ago. "
Power Rangers Ninja Steel,To me that was the last good one. I think the one after was about magic and wands and it really turned me off. 
Power Rangers Ninja Steel,I had the exact same thought. Dino Thunder was the last season I watched. That's also probably around the time I stopped watching Saturday morning cartoons as well.
Power Rangers Ninja Steel,I feel even older. After Zeo is where I dropped off. 
Power Rangers Ninja Steel,Dino Thunder was when I got into Power Rangers for the first time. To think it's been so long already...
Power Rangers Ninja Steel,"Side note, you should check this out, if fox had kept the rights for season 11

http://powerrangers.wikia.com/wiki/Hexagon"
Power Rangers Ninja Steel,"Wait, why are the power rangers fighting the beetleborgs?"
Power Rangers Ninja Steel,"I feel like *Power Rangers* is basically the Star Trek of Kids TV as far as being this gigantic universe, although from what I understand unlike Star Trek PR doesn't really lean into the continuity (especially once they stopped being a continuing team with turnover and instead became a entirely new team every year) except for on rare occasions like these anniversary episodes. That of course is for the obvious reason that this is a low-budget kids show that is built around footage from a Japanese kids show with even less overall continuity. 
"
Power Rangers Ninja Steel,Forever Red is such a great episode
Power Rangers Ninja Steel,That's the best episode of the series
Power Rangers Ninja Steel,"I had the same thought and came into the comments only to post a ""WHAT YEAR IS IT?"" meme for Saba."
Power Rangers Ninja Steel,"Yup still doing that. This episode was special for the 25th anniversary, but back to business as usual next week where pretty much all morphed scenes are from sentai footage"
Power Rangers Ninja Steel,"There are infographics out there showing what percentage of Japanese footage/Original footage was used, and in a majority of episodes the original footage accounts for 60%-100% of the episode. Only a very short sequence here was actually Japanese footage."
Power Rangers Ninja Steel,"> looked really sad for some reason

Yeah, he met you! :p"
Power Rangers Ninja Steel,tommy gave the powers to tj and tj is in the episode 
Power Rangers Ninja Steel,You mean Adam Park (Johnny Yong Bosch) and not Jason right?
Power Rangers Ninja Steel,Definitely. Jason is the only one to ever actually be shown close to on par with Tommy at base power 
Power Rangers Ninja Steel,What about Billy.
Power Rangers Ninja Steel,25th anniversary special. For anniversaries they tend to bring back rangers from earlier series to team up with the current ones to fight whatever big bad currently exists. 
Power Rangers Ninja Steel,"""Why was I programmed to feel pain?"""
Power Rangers Ninja Steel,Tj is the red turbo ranger
Power Rangers Ninja Steel,"Yeah, every time they do a thing for Tommy being in all his old suits, they never use Turbo Red. "
Power Rangers Ninja Steel,The red turbo ranger is there already 
Power Rangers Ninja Steel,Probably didn't do it since TJ is there even though TJ didn't morph into Turbo Red.
Power Rangers Ninja Steel,Dragon Zord and Dragon DaggerFlute are better than White Tiger Zord and Saba. But White is better than Green.
Power Rangers Ninja Steel,"They are connected when it's convenient to be. They kept a continuity going for the first few seasons up through Lost Galaxy, but after that basically every season is set in the same universe, but they ignore all the previous ones unless they are doing a special episode. It's Power Rangers, so logical consistency isn't very high for anything, continuity included."
Power Rangers Ninja Steel,Tommy gave the powers to tj who appears in this episode
Power Rangers Ninja Steel,That was the actor behind the Wild Force Red.
MINDHUNTER,Really loved this show. Definitely one of my favorite Netflix offerings.
MINDHUNTER,"That's incredibly disappointing, but unfortunately not surprising"
MINDHUNTER,Shame they teased BTK only to never have the storyline come to fruition.
MINDHUNTER,"The interview is in French, here’s what Fincher said about the show:

**Will there be a sequel to your Mindhunter series?**

>FINCHER: “I'm very proud of the first two seasons. But it's a very expensive show and, in the eyes of Netflix, we didn't attract enough of an audience to justify such an investment (for Season 3). I don't blame them, they took risks to get the show off the ground, gave me the means to do Mank [his black and white film about 1930s Hollywood] the way I wanted to do it, and they allowed me to venture down new paths with The Killer. It's a blessing to be able to work with people who are capable of boldness. The day our desires are not the same, we have to be honest about parting ways.”"
MINDHUNTER,Booooo
MINDHUNTER,"I thought the show didn't comeback because Fincher spent so much time on it and it was taking him from other projects?

Either way, its disappointing that its not coming back. Even just with a shorter final season to wrap things up. 

This show was the best crime show on television since True Detective season 1."
MINDHUNTER,"That’s fucked up, that show ruled. They should at least do a movie about BTK, they set that shit up since the beginning."
MINDHUNTER,"Someone call the feds, cause this man just murdered my hopes and dreams."
MINDHUNTER,"The best marriage of film and music ever (imo) was the scene where In Every Dream Home a Heartache by Roxy Music played over BTK’s wife coming home and finding him, a-hem, workin the knob of you will. Cutting the song out right before the massive breakdown/release in the song is so genius"
MINDHUNTER,What a load of wasted potential. The highest quality show Netflix has produced in terms of cinematography and just straight up writing and acting. Mindhinter season 1 is one of my favorite seasons of television ever.
MINDHUNTER,"oh but rest asserted, Big Mouth will continue"
MINDHUNTER,"Anna Torv, forever in my heart."
MINDHUNTER,"Man they had such a good cast, the first season is just phenomenal. Second season was good, some storylines I could have done without but I wish so bad it kept going."
MINDHUNTER,"They’ve said this like 10 times now, please stop twisting the knife"
MINDHUNTER,Thanks for the bad news David.
MINDHUNTER,Sad face. There were teasing the BTK as well as what was gonna happen with Bil Tench’s family.
MINDHUNTER,"He is going to take the fucking thing from you, kill you and have sex with your face-Bill Tench"
MINDHUNTER,I'm still annoyed that the guy decided to make a story designed for 5 seasons and just decided he's too busy after  2 seasons. Such a bummer. It was easily the best show Netflix had made and one of my all time favourites
MINDHUNTER,Very disappointing. This absolutely deserved a third season.
MINDHUNTER,"My disappointment is immeasurable, and my day is ruined."
MINDHUNTER,I am disappointed
MINDHUNTER,What a bummer.
MINDHUNTER,"Gee, thanks. What a waste."
MINDHUNTER,. . . So you’re telling me there’s a chance.
MINDHUNTER,Dumb. Like the only show I wanted them to continue also.
MINDHUNTER,This is criminal.
MINDHUNTER,"Sucks because with the recent mainstream breakthrough of Dahmer, it would make sense to give Mindhunter another season since they did serial killer thrillers (arguably) better and were the first to do so.   


I loved Mindhunter because it had Fincher's trademarks all over it, was a loose documentary of how the FBI profiled these criminals early on, all the while exploring the psychological side to serial killers; here's to hoping a different company picks up the show."
MINDHUNTER,"If low viewership numbers was the sole reason, Netflix would just have cancelled it outright. Instead they first put it on hold and only sometime later released the cast from their contracts. 

I guess Netflix wanted season 3 but with some compromises after the season 2 production nightmare but Fincher of course wasn't going to accept that."
MINDHUNTER,"Literally just finished a rewatch today. Such a well done show and such a let down to not see how things progress. Bill's family issues, the BTK story line, everything they've worked towards, it just feels like such a loss and it genuinely saddens me that we never get to see anything play out."
MINDHUNTER,"God damn, this show was amazing. Let me guess season 10 of stranger things will be renewed where the kids are now 20 years old and pretending to be in 8th grade"
MINDHUNTER,Boooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
MINDHUNTER,It was Fincher and his bullshit not Netflix
MINDHUNTER,"This is horrible news! This show was so good that it’s still sitting with me years later. If you need a Mindhunter fix - I recommend reading the book. The Mindhunter was co-authored by John E. Douglas who inspired the Holden Ford character, played by Jonathan Groff. I couldn’t put the book down - once it got to his FBI work. There were nights that I’d read a hundred pages or more when I was just trying to get a few minutes of reading in before bed. It drags you inside the pages and doesn’t shake you loose until the last word, and even then, you’re still haunted by the words. He has co-authored several other books as well, but this is his most prolific.

&nbsp;
I’m a creative producer who’s worked in TV for 15 years, so if it’s a matter of who has time to take on the project- call me Netflix. I’ve got it from here."
MINDHUNTER,Brutal.  Show was so good.  Apparently Fincher was working 90 hour weeks   Basically unsustainable   It’s the only way he works he can delegate
MINDHUNTER,"I need to know what happened to the fucking cat, David!"
MINDHUNTER,Horse pucky
MINDHUNTER,A fucking travesty
MINDHUNTER,Booooo!
MINDHUNTER,"That’s too bad, I really enjoy the show."
MINDHUNTER,Pain.
MINDHUNTER,Really fucking annoying. That show smacked.
MINDHUNTER,I mean where ppl really expecting it to come back?
MINDHUNTER,It was a good show. That's too bad.
MINDHUNTER,I love Mindhunter. It’s my comfort show
MINDHUNTER,What. A. Fucking. Waste.
MINDHUNTER,"But don’t worry guys, Big Mouth has been renewed for 10 more seasons! Big Mouth, everyone’s absolute favorite show! /s"
MINDHUNTER,Why post an article in another language?  Idiotic.
MINDHUNTER,Between this and him bailing the Girl w the Dragon Tattoo sequels years ago I’m really disappointed.
MINDHUNTER,I blame the bad tastes of audiences for not watching more
MINDHUNTER,Booooooooo
MINDHUNTER,But what will happen with the crossdressing ADT salesmen?
MINDHUNTER,"""I'm very proud of the first two seasons. But it's a very expensive show and, in the eyes of Netflix, we didn't attract enough of an audience to justify such an investment (for Season 3). I don't blame them""  


Well I \*do\* blame them. Netflix did no promotion for S2. None. I didn't see any previews for it although I had watched S1 so their algorithm should have known I would be interested in it. The only reason I even knew S2 was released is because I saw a comment on this sub about it. Not surprisingly with NO PROMOTION and NO INFORMATION TO VIEWERS ABOUT IT BEING AVAILABLE the ratings for S2 weren't that high."
MINDHUNTER,"A shame. I wish someone else could take the reins and continue the story.  Probably wouldn't be as good as Fincher's vision, but since it's built around some historical events/people and is not a 100% fictional world, a new team at least has a standing structure to build from."
MINDHUNTER,Sad
MINDHUNTER,We love da Finchman!
MINDHUNTER,Surely another company can buy it? Wasn’t the expanse on netflix? They cancelled it and Amazon bought it off them?
MINDHUNTER,And now BTK is doing commercials for Jimmy Johns…. THEY SUCK!
MINDHUNTER,That tense + mysterious feeling that runs though that show - unlike anything I've ever experienced.
MINDHUNTER,Literally the only Netflix original I personally really enjoyed.
MINDHUNTER,Boooooooooo
MINDHUNTER,Forgot about it at this point. Nothing of worth lost
MINDHUNTER,One of the best Netflix shows. What a damn shame
MINDHUNTER,My disappointment is immeasurable and my day is ruined.
MINDHUNTER,Boo
MINDHUNTER,"Season 2 felt pretty contrived, didn’t have the dynamism of season 1"
MINDHUNTER,"Budding shows: How do you succeed at Netflix without being Stranger Things?

Netflix: That's the neat part, you won't!"
MINDHUNTER,"Fucking incredible excited for 0.1 seconds until I got to ""will.not""..."
MINDHUNTER,"Why throw salt in our wound. We already figured this back when David said he had no interest in doing the show anymore.  Too bad, cuz he was on to something there"
MINDHUNTER,“Be glad you got a season 2” - Archive 81 fan
MINDHUNTER,I’m tired of Netflix canceling cool af content prematurely.
MINDHUNTER,Damn. Double damn. Damn it. I really wanted this to happen.
MINDHUNTER,I’ve been saying this for a year but I work in film and we already knew. Wish HBO would pick it up!
MINDHUNTER,This show really stood out in Netflix’s loaded arsenal of serial killer content. Real shame
MINDHUNTER,hard to have a worse link than this.. in french AND paywalled
MINDHUNTER,Damn. Instead we got 4 seasons of YOU smh
MINDHUNTER,Fincher is a genius when it comes to fumbling bags. He halted production on a great tv show to produce a mid movie.
MINDHUNTER,It's a shame.  But maybe Fincher needs to learn that a simple scene can be just as good without spending a fortune on CGI clouds and trees.
MINDHUNTER,Well shit!! Holt and Torv were awesome in it.
MINDHUNTER,"Season 2 felt so contrived and nowhere near as gripping as the first season, I'm not surprised."
MINDHUNTER,Boooooooooo
MINDHUNTER,"BOOOOOO

BOOOOOO

BOOOOOO"
MINDHUNTER,I feel like “at Netflix” is a keyword here. Maybe they can find some other platform to continue it on.
MINDHUNTER,"This show was too good for the brainlets that Netflix feeds with their garbage shows. Also stop trying to make me watch Korean soap drama after watching squid game, you bastard."
MINDHUNTER,"If Fincher is unable to finish it out, I would love to see a final season done without as much CG to bring the budget to a reasonable place and have the minds behind Blackbird do it hopefully on Apple, or even stay at Netflix. It really was an incredible two season series regardless."
MINDHUNTER,"It shall remain a shining example of what good shows can be in scope, narrative, and acting"
MINDHUNTER,Is this new news?  I thought a season 3 was incredible unlikely.
MINDHUNTER,Why does he keep putting the blame on Netflix when Netflix and himself in other articles state that it was him that wanted to go on and do other projects?
MINDHUNTER,I honestly think Fincher got bored with this and wanted move on to other things. I don't believe Netflix would mind a 3rd season.
MINDHUNTER,"I would love a good procedural about agents tracking down serial killers. Something like criminal minds, but a heavy R rating with the writing of a mindhunter."
MINDHUNTER,Does that mean there will be a third on another service or it’s just over?
MINDHUNTER,YET WE HAVE TO SIT THROUGH ANOTHER SEASON OF EMILY IN PARIS?!?!
MINDHUNTER,just fell to my knees in the middle of my bedroom
MINDHUNTER,Fuck you Netflix.
MINDHUNTER,"Fuck you, Fincher."
MINDHUNTER,"We all knew this, at this point."
MINDHUNTER,"All the talk of it being too expensive for Netflix to stomach is only one part of the story, from what I can tell.

Shooting the show was a fucking bear, and required a pretty stacked cast to clear their schedules out and move to Pittsburgh for like a year. Fincher dipping after the second season to make *Mank* (the less said about that movie, the better) certainly didn’t help the third season gain any momentum, as the cast started booking other stuff at that point. And then, on top of all that, Netflix was like “yea, this show is fucking expensive and has a small-ish audience, and for that reason I’m out.”

Netflix can suck it, and I’m not defending them here, but Fincher is not easy to work with and was not super focused on this project moving forwards. I love the guy, he’s maybe my favorite director ever, but he’s a weird, meticulous, flighty dude that didn’t exactly do the show any favors in terms of renewal. I’m sure the logistics of shopping a third season to another streamer are not simple, but it also seems like Fincher shrugged and was like “whatever, Imma make *Mank* and *The Killer* and not fret about it.”

Sounds to me like Netflix said no, but Fincher implicitly allowed the project to die on the branch a bit as well. It sucks, a third season would have absolutely ruled based on what they had planned, but them’s the brakes. I’ll be watching *The Killer* like six times, a la Steven Soderbergh in his media diary."
MINDHUNTER,"Imagine being Netflix right now; HBO Max has like 5 active prestige dramas (and the new True Detective season is about to start as well), and Netflix *has absolutely nothing* in terms of award contenders.

They’ll throw their entire bankroll at a distasteful show like Dahmer, promote it like it’s a new Stranger Things season, but they refuse to fund an actual tasteful serial killer drama that clearly does have a massive following as we can see in here.

Season two didn’t fail because of Fincher, it failed because Netflix didn’t promote it all. How the *fuck* do you not promote a Fincher serial killer drama like crazy? That’s his best genre."
MINDHUNTER,Netflix really be cancelling amazing series so they're able to keep pumping out mediocre shows and comedy specials nobody asked for or needed.
MINDHUNTER,Thats what happens when you got 15 serial killer series in production..
MINDHUNTER,"Honestly this has me incredibly frustrated and I'm really struggling to keep watching things for them to be cancelled. Netflix mismanagement is eating itself.


Mindhunter is one of the best pieces of adult content Netflix had and while I had already resigned myself to the idea it wouldn't continue, it still hurts that is now confirmed."
Super Monsters,High praise.
Super Monsters,Netflix has had some absolutely amazing kid shows. I dont know why they haven't done more to push these shows.
Super Monsters,"I worked on this show and it was the best fun I've had on a project. I'd watch all the episodes in storyboard form as soon as they were delivered and my wife and I binged it the moment it was released (a full year after animation wrapped mind you).

The interactive map sounded cool when I heard about it and I was blown away by the art and animation (done by a separate team in Singapore). In practice though it was just a clunky pain in the arse and most people I told to watch it reported problems. Some couldn't watch it at all. 

I really thought it would break through but IMO netflix buried it in the kids section. Amongst so many try-hard adult oriented cartoons battle kitty had real heart. Such a shame.

Glad you enjoyed it though."
Super Monsters,That’s up to the kids to decide
Super Monsters,I’m willing to say it’s in the same category of peak Cartoon Network with Adventure Time and Regular Show. It’s that freaking good.
Super Monsters,"This is a hill I'm willing to die on. Especially because ""Band Geeks"" from Spongebob is one of the better episodes in all of Television"
Super Monsters,"I agree with you. It's interesting cause some of them aren't even truly ""Kids shows"", it's just how they're categorized. Like this one tailors itself to a younger audience but my partner and I love it"
Super Monsters,"Any chance of getting a s2?! 

I never experiences any problems with the interactive map though I do feel it made episode selection sometimes a bit more tedious. That said, the story and writing were so incredible that it made any issues seem mute. I desperately hope for another season as I got to the end and just craved more!

Thanks for your work on it and it shows clearly you all cared about making something both good and fun!"
Super Monsters,Thanks I appreciate it. As far as season 2 goes I lean towards probably not. Netflix is a bit of a black box so it's hard to tell but based on the lack of online buzz it didn't take off. Only possibility is if the creators can take it to another production house. You could always tweet at Matt Layzell and ask him haha
Super Monsters,"Great explanation of the time lines! Gonna show this to my folks who are watching, but are mildly confused. 

However, you missed one of my favorite (small) details: 

Ciri and Geralt’s destinies are so intertwined that the farmer Geralt saved from ghouls actually offers him the Law of Surprise as payment. Geralt immediately refuses, but had he accepted,  Ciri would have once again been his reward.  She was what the farmer had waiting for him at home, but did not know."
Super Monsters,"I'm Confused. I've play the games and read about the books, always believed Gerald white hair was due to a more advanced set of trials rarely given to any witcher."
Super Monsters,"Thanks for the write up of especially the pre story lore of the world as I didn’t get all of that from the snippets of dialogue in the show.  

I do have a question, what is the valley of plenty?"
Super Monsters,">  Geralt saves Yen by wishing for their fates to be bound together.

Do we know what he wished for?"
Super Monsters,[deleted]
Super Monsters,"I think you misrepresented nilfgaard a bit, in a lot of ways they are better than the north for being more advanced and not racist, however Nilfgaard does employ slave labour, slaves that are usually supplied via the wars of agression they fight, and their ""manifest destiny"" of conquering the entire continent doesn't come with just a desire for unification, but with genocide and atrocities that are pretty fucking terrible, if they don't kill people they displace them and bring in colonists from nilfgaard instead, and in Nilfgaard you get hanged by the tiniest of offenses, like speaking ill of the imperator, whereas in the northen kingdoms criticism of the kings and queens is pretty common."
Super Monsters,"As someone who had no prior knowledge of the Witcher (other than that it existed), I felt the show did quite well in explaining itself.  It usually takes me awhile to catch on so no surprise that I didn't realize 3 seperate timelines until ep5.

That said I didn't know everything you wrote, so it's a nice little background but not entirely necessary to keep up with the show and understand what was happening.

Still, thank you for this."
Super Monsters,"I do wish they had added a little more fun between Geralt and Jaskier. The sho presents Jaskier as an eternal pain in the ass, and it feels like Geralt just basically dislikes him. Hard to fit all that into a single season, but the way they presented it feels forced."
Super Monsters,"Thank you so much for this. As someone new to the world, I did not find the series confusing, but I am very grateful for your short description of the background of the world. The whole Conjunction was mentioned in the show, but was not really explained. Really interesting to read about. 

I do have a few questions

> There’s frankly a pretty good case to be made that the citizens of the north would be better off if conquered by Nilfgaard, although since the protagonists are part of the small minority that wouldn’t be better off (rulers, sorceresses, witchers), they don’t see it that way. 

I am happy to read this. I actually found myself cheering for Nilfgaard in the final battle. I could not figure out if the show intentionally wanted us to see good and bad on both sides, or if the show just failed in giving me any sympathy for the North. 

Sure, Nilfgaard was portrayed as pretty bad in some areas, but the whole ""Defend our way of life in the North"" that the Brotherhood kept talking about did not convince me. Their way of life is to turn innocent girls into eels and to kill baby girls who were born at the wrong time... 

Are we supposed to see the North as the good guys and cheer for them? Or is it on purpose that the show is hinting towards Nilfgaard not being the worst side? 

Also, I was confused why Yennefer joined the battle for the Brotherhood. During the whole series she has seemed mostly focused on herself and on achieving beauty, power etc. It seemed that it came down to Tissaia saying something like ""Do it for me"". But I really do not feel the show succeeded in showing any kind of friendship or loyalty between Yenn and Tiss."
Super Monsters,"To give you some more history about the politics of the Witcher, you need to understand the history of Poland.

Poland, itself, is a country of iterations. Going back from when people bothered recording history we see that the slavic regions have been a stopping off point for many nomadic peoples, from the goths to the Burgundy to the  Tatars, to Mongolians and Germans, and vikings and jews. No one peoples have a claim to the idea of an ethnic pure poland, as poland itself is extremely diverse set of peoples. This is analogous to the Conjunction of the Spheres, as the Elves weren't the first people in the land of the Witcher, and neither were the Dwarves, gnomes are the oldest known ""civilized"" creature in the Witcher World, but that doesn't even take into account the other ""monsters"". In this sense, the amount of monsters and different elder races and humanity living together represent the messy living situation that is the polish ethnic makeup, and how at times it can be peaceful with lots of harmony, and incredibly violent. 

Now; the Nilfgaard vs Northern Realms is something analogous so what happened in more recent history; In World War 2, Poland was being carved up by the two world superpower. The Ethnic cleansing warmongering Fascist-feudalist state that was Nazi Germany (Northern Kingdoms), and the technologically advancing mega-empire with more money and manpower than sense in the Soviet Union (Nilfgaard). Nilfgaard (Soviets) were kinder to the Elder Races (Gypsies) than the Northern Kingdoms (Nazis), so they felt that it was fight or die, while the Northern Kingdoms wanted an ethnically pure realm by ghettoizing and displacing as any of the Elderblood as possible for ""The safety of and prosperity of the Kingdom"".

This dichotomy is what leads us to the Anti-politics Geralt, who represents the post-soviet attitude of Poland that is Neo-Liberalism, the idea of free movement and a more tolerant society for the purpose of ensuring a more free, less oppressed, and more resilient Polish republic."
Super Monsters,[deleted]
Super Monsters,"They should have played the opening animated intro (not the CG) to Witcher 3. Briefly explains magic, the conjunction, witchers, people's attitude toward both, and touched on the wild hunt.

Super Monsters,[removed]
Super Monsters,"One thing I would add is that the farmer Gerlalt saved offered him the law of surprise as payment for saving his life.  The reward would then be Ciri who his daughter was taking in as a new daughter and, thus, his new granddaughter.   This further reinforces the destiny between Geralt and Ciri."
Super Monsters,"Good write-up! Although I disagree with the decision to jump around the timelines so much, they do try and drop a few hints here and there that let you figure it out. I think the first one is when they talk about an old battle that Calanthe won, and a few scenes later we hear that she's just won it. There's also stuff like Foltest as an adult king vs. seeing him as a child. You can definitely reconstruct the timelines based on the hints, but it's really hard to do on the fly as you're trying to watch the show."
Super Monsters,"Omg, you linked my version of the Witcher map!"
Super Monsters,"Thank you so much for this.  I am enjoying the snow but have been relatively lost.  I don't consider myself a total idiot, either (though that's certainly a matter of opinion).  I was just thinking to myself that this show is likely much better understood by those who are already familiar with it."
Super Monsters,"This is very well written, but I feel like the show generally explains things pretty plainly in exposition if you just pay attention."
Super Monsters,"I never read the books or played the games, but I did still pick up on most of that stuff. However, the one thing I didn't pick up on at all is that Nilfgaard isn't actually the bad guys. 

The army clad in black armor surely had to be the horrible people. It is pretty much the trope of all movies/shows that the people in black attire are the bad guys. 

As I watched though, they never really seemed that bad. I just figured they hadn't expressed their true intentions yet. So, the whole time I was just thinking; ""what are they up to?"""
Super Monsters,"If Nilfgaard is this advanced civilization, why does it have a leave nobody alive policy during war?  It instantly makes them look like the bad guys and somewhere else in this post it says Nilfgaard uses slaves so it’s be counterintuitive to kill everyone.  Does this have something to do specifically with Cintra or do Cintrans just think Nilfgaard is like that because they tend to dehumanize the south?"
Super Monsters,"This is going to get me downvoted, but I don’t care. Evidently there’s something fundamentally flawed about your storytelling when fans have to write a 20+ paragraph explanation as to what’s going on. 

It’s one of my major gripes about the show - your average Netflix dude/lady isn’t going to understand the world—isn’t given enough information to—and likely isn’t going to deep dive the internet for information if they see a show that jumps around timelines and assumes you already know characters. My friends couldn’t get into it for this reason.

I like the show and hope it improves but this shouldn’t be the norm."
Super Monsters,"It’s a shame the show needs the fans to fill in everything the show runners failed to accomplish themselves. Cavill is great, but they need to replace the writing/production team. The costumes, dialog, and soundstage feel aren’t up to snuff in 2020.

I’m worried it’s not going to get a third season with drop off of non-Witcher fans."
Super Monsters,"If I need to read paragraphs of explanation to understand the show, did the writers do a good enough job of world building? I understand they’re not holding our hand, so to speak, but neither did GoT and it was understandable."
Super Monsters,"Great effort, mate. Appreciated"
Super Monsters,"The endless circlejerking for this show is so tiring now.

Saying shit like ""this show doesnt hold hands"" is some serious rick and morty level defending to excuse some pretty sub par writing/direction.

To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand the witcher."
Super Monsters,"I rewatched it again and realized that time doesn't go back and forth. It's consistent, but it jumps for one character to catch up to the other.

Geralt starts when his legend began. Blaviken.

Yennifer starts when her legend began. The Lodge of Sorcerers.

Ciri's starts when her legend began. The Cintra massacre.

The stories don't interwove into each other yet. They show their exploits and experiences first. Time is going forward but at different points. They merge together at the end."
Super Monsters,This is a great primer but you shouldn’t have to know all this to enjoy a TV show. It was a jumbled mess and I doubt I’ll watch season 2.
Super Monsters,"I'm late to the game, so this will probably go unnoticed, but I'd still like to show my appreciation for this post.

My biggest complaint about the show - for someone unfamiliar with the Witcher - was how we did have no notion at all how the world worked. There is no timeframe, no location, things just happen. It felt like a small world, because I had no idea what the larger scope was.

The plot felt so convoluted and I really feel they could have used your writing on the show. 
Words like ""meanwhile"", ""northern"", etc.. can give us more information about a larger world while keeping the story focused in a monster-of-the-week routine while we follow Geralt.
Including a map would work too, exactly how you did, because it can make for much better understanding.
Great fantasy shows like ""GoT"" or ""Avatar: the Last Airbender"" even feature their map in their openings, because they know they are important for worldbuilding.

All in all, I did think it was an average to subpar fantasy show when you consider the above. This post made a lot things more clear, which I believe shouldn't have. Since a good story is clear on itself."
Super Monsters,"Okay, this summary made way more sense than the show itself did."
Super Monsters,"> In Nilfgaard, elves and dwarves are treated as full citizens 

Nope, that's fanfiction. Nilfgaard's internal racial relations are never addressed. Over the course of the books, we meet only 2 elves (and not a single dwarf) in the South, so it's possible they simply do not have any significant population of elves and dwarves. 

> There’s frankly a pretty good case to be made that the citizens of the north would be better off if conquered by Nilfgaard 

Again, fanfiction (aka Witcher 3). They would be dead or enslaved, since Nilfgaard's goal is to replace Nordlings with their own settlers to achieve Lebensraum (a living space). As a state, they have very little redeeming qualities. Individual Nilfgaardian characters can be nice though."
Super Monsters,"As a person who first played the games in their release-order and who read most of the books I didn't find the timeline too hard to follow or separate after the third or so episode, and my girlfriend who watched it with me and who never played the games before also caught on to it quickly without needing my help with explaining anything.

And as much as it can be a bit confusing for the first episode or two I actually really appreciate how the story was structured since it really puts the differnce in life-span between Sorcerors/Sorceresses, Witchers and humans as a whole into sharp contrast.

While Gerald and Yennefer is effectively just dicking their way through the decades a teenage-queen becomes a mom, a granny and eventually see her kingdom razed to the ground."
Super Monsters,My wife and I are watching the series now and were quite confused. Your timeline doesn't seem to match what we are watching.
Super Monsters,"I know that I will get downvoted for this but if the first season of a fantasy show needs a post like this to explain it... then it is not a good show.     

I am currently watching the Dark crystal age of resistance and it has a lot of fantasy elements which are very original yet nothing that needs a lot of outside explanation if you have not seen the movie since it explains most of them as the story goes on"
Super Monsters,"I watched it and was also mildly confused until the last two episodes. If a show needs a ""guild"" then it wasn't explained good enough in the series. Did anyone notice when a time or scene changed there was never a caption explaining the time or location? Pretty frustrating and not insightful"
Super Monsters,"Guide or no guide, it's still an average show"
Super Monsters,Appreciate the help!
Super Monsters,"The thing is, this being necessary means the show failed in its job."
Super Monsters,"Very nice explaination. Although the plotis not hard to understand by just watching, your write-up makes it better.

> Geralt broke out of Cintran captivity in the chaos, but had no idea that Ciri successfully made it out, too. Geralt, like Ciri and the Nilfgaardians, also travels north from Cintra, in his case heading for the witcher’s keep of Kaer Morhen to lick his wounds and feel sorry for himself over the whole Ciri business. He saves a travelling farmer from ghouls attracted by the bodies of Cintran refugees, but catches a nasty bite in the process. The farmer tosses Geralt in his cart to recuperate. As a wound-fevered Geralt is transported back to the farmer's house, the Battle of Sodden Hill happens close enough to be within earshot, and Yennefer (who Geralt doesn’t know is fighting in that battle) goes MIA after summoning a firestorm that stops the invasion cold.

You didn't mention the part where Geralt saw his mother. Was that a ""dream"" or was his mother actually there?"
Super Monsters,It’s a really big indictment on the writing in the show that you’d feel like this type of thing was necessary.
Super Monsters,This is an absurdly long post for a show that isn’t at all hard to follow
Super Monsters,"Holy heck thank you for this write up. I watched the show and loved it though was very confused initially. I own Witcher 3 but haven’t played and have never read the books. It helped so much, especially the backstory."
Super Monsters,Extremely helpful and well-written. Thanks!
Super Monsters,"Thanks so much for this. I went in totally blind and this helped world-build a ton for me. I think the show is entertaining and pretty well done, but I wish this backstory would have been explained more (or better)."
Super Monsters,Very helpful. I think if you pay attention most of this is clear in the show but this definitely helped me connect some dots. The law of surprise connection being such a strong father - daughter bond for them was not 100% clear to me before this so things make a lot more sense now.
Super Monsters,"The wish to tie their fates together, didn't that stop the djinn because if the djinn killed Yennifer then it would have killed Geralt and a djinn cannot kill it's master?"
Super Monsters,Fantastic writeup
Super Monsters,"Good writeup overall, missing most of the details of Yennefer's plotline, but I can see why you left them out for clarity's sake."
Super Monsters,[deleted]
Super Monsters,"Super helpful. Once I realized there were more than once timeline, even for just a relatively short period of the show, I got co fused and somehow thought Renfri and Yen would end up being the same person. Like Yen would transform to Renfri which is why Renfri was a monster or something."
Super Monsters,"Any explanation as to why Geralt's eyes turn black and face turns extra veiny looking during a fight, but he looks like a normal, painfully handsome man the rest of the time."
Super Monsters,Saved for when in finished
Super Monsters,Very good post
Super Monsters,"The only thing that bothered me was the characterization of the Wizards/Sorcererers in the series. In the books and games, they are said to be the most beautiful/handsome a person can get due to magic manipulation. So they should be all Kens and Barbies, but i can udnerstand the issues of adapting that."
Super Monsters,Thanks man this helped so much! Hopefully they have a less confusing timeline in season 2
Super Monsters,"Thanks very much for the write up! It's nice to have some of those gaps filled in. I didn't see this asked anywhere, so apologies if this was clarified, but why was the law of surprise in one case (Duny) a marriage, but in another (Geralt/Ciri) it's protection? 

Will Geralt eventually marry Ciri when she gets older or something? The rules just seem so ambiguous for such a powerful request."
Super Monsters,"RemindMe! One week ""Read this when you have finished the series"""
Super Monsters,"Thanks, that is helpful. Never read books or played games but post TV series, inspired to buy and started playing Witcher 3. Already learnt lots prior to this post thanks to the game."
Super Monsters,Save for later
Super Monsters,Commenting to find later!
Super Monsters,Awesome write up! Succinct and to the point. I like how you skipped over the entire forest of Brokilon arc with a single sentence :p
Super Monsters,Bravo and thank you.  *Tosses a silver to his Witcher bard*
Super Monsters,Question for anyone who caught this: what was vilgefortz doing at the end? He survives his battle with Cahir and then wakes up and....bashes a friendly mage's head in with a club? I was so confused.
Super Monsters,"If they’d simply added some kind of year captions before each short story, it would’ve solved a lot of problems. Even something so basic as “X years before the War”"
Super Monsters,Wow this was so thorough and now I know what the hell is going on with no help of wikipedia. Thank you!
Super Monsters,"One detail I think is really good to show the tone of the series is that Gerald does not get the butcher of blaviken moniker because he killed some cutthroats, but rather because he opposed the elite/rulers, that being the mage."
Super Monsters,"A bunch of people have probably already said it, but thank you.  This is a great, concise piece that filled in several gaps for me about the show."
Super Monsters,That was very helpful in filling some plot points I missed
Super Monsters,"Fun fact: if Geralt had invoked the law of surprise for helping the farmer at the end, he would have gotten Ciri twice by the law."
Super Monsters,"Thank you for this great recap. I watched the show without any background knowledge and it was a bit confusing to follow at times. I had to go look up a few things between episodes.

This summary lets me know that I did get the gist of things from the show. When I watch it again I think I'll be able to enjoy it more now that I know what's going on."
Super Monsters,There's a place called flotsam but not jetsam
Super Monsters,Saved this for later.
Super Monsters,Thank you for posting this. I had never played the games nor read any of the lore. Loved this series and can’t wait for more.  This guide has helped me put some pieces together of the history that I was unsure of.
Super Monsters,Bookmark
Super Monsters,"even with my playing the game, this is more thorough and a wonderful guide!"
Super Monsters,did you just write another book...
Super Monsters,Will be showing this to my partner. Great write up.
Super Monsters,Thank you!!
Super Monsters,I'd like to know more about Filavandrel's uprising
Super Monsters,"Top job! I didn't miss anything in your recap of the series it seems, but I really liked your summary of the world at the start, I didn't know much of the world building stuff."
Super Monsters,God’s work
Super Monsters,"It'd be dope if they explained this better in the show. I love a non-linear narrative but the way they attempted it did not make sense.

I think one problem is throwing too many unknown nouns at us too quickly"
Super Monsters,"You sir, are a god among men"
Super Monsters,"You say Nilfgaard attacking Cintra is an irrational desire that wont be revealed until season two, but I got the impression Nilfgaard wanted Cintra as they needed Ciri because some mysterious white flame told them to? I mean you don't know the exact reasons and I am sure they will be expanded on in S2, but that is the premise yes?"
Super Monsters,"Just finished the series today. 
Great write up! Didn’t realise that was why Geralt couldn’t sleep. 

Really helpful"
Super Monsters,Someone toss this man a coin!
Super Monsters,Thanks for putting this together. I was completely new to the Witcher with while watching the tv show. I didn’t even realize they were playing with the timelines until a few episodes in. This background gave some great context.
Super Monsters,What was the comment about not being able to make any more Witchers?
Super Monsters,"Really appreciate this. This was better explanation than the show! I watched the show due to all the hubbub and enjoyed it. But def could feel there is sooooo much more going on that isn't being explained. It would be great for fans already of the books and games. However being Netflix and so mainstream with tons of the audience not being familiar with the TW universe previously, I'm confused why they didn't explain much of this better."
Super Monsters,Great guide!
Super Monsters,"Keep up the chatter, we need so many seasons!"
Super Monsters,Omg. My wife an I just discussed how this detail was missing for nubes. Thank you!
The Frozen Dead,He had such a strong screen presence. RIP

this is so out of nowhere and he kicked so much ass. this sucks."
The Frozen Dead,"According to Law Enforcement, it was natural causes:

>Law enforcement sources tell TMZ ...  Lance's body was discovered at his Studio City home Friday morning around 9:30 AM. His cause of death is currently unclear, but our law enforcement sources say it appears to be natural.

RIP"
The Frozen Dead,"holy shit WHAT

he was great on Fringe"
The Frozen Dead,Loved him as Colonel Broyles in Fringe.
The Frozen Dead,He has one of the best skits on the Eric Andre show too
The Frozen Dead,"Sad day for any Destiny fan.  A legend for his role in The Wire.  He was on cast for the Percy Jackson reboot too.

RIP."
The Frozen Dead,I was just Playing Horizon Forbidden West a couple of days ago and thinking of all the shows he's been in that I like.
The Frozen Dead,"Oh my gosh this is so heartbreaking. 

The guy was amazing in literally every role I ever seen him in.

Props to his absolutely amazing Eric Andre guest spot!

RIP to a legit legend"
The Frozen Dead,"He'll get praise for his other works but he was pretty fuckin hilarious in the show Corporate.  
As a late comer to the Wire, my first time seeing him was the season 4 premiere of Lost where he left quite an impression."
The Frozen Dead,Seeing him in Wick 4 next week will be sad now
The Frozen Dead,☹ loved him in Bosch...
The Frozen Dead,"That sucks so bad, the guy was a legend. I'm watching Fringe as I read this."
The Frozen Dead,No Sylens.... RIP
The Frozen Dead,Natural Po-lice. Fucking gutted man the man was a fantastic actor with incredible presence. From Oz and the Wire to Fringe and John Wick he always delievered.
The Frozen Dead,"A lot of his high points are rightly discussed. 

I want to mention, _Corporate_, a really small sitcom that ran for 3 seasons and was hilarious. He was excellent as the big honcho, playing it completely straight in this goofy comedy and stealing his scenes. Great actor!"
The Frozen Dead,Rip Zavala :(
The Frozen Dead,noooo   ........ im gutted.......
The Frozen Dead,"What... I can't believe it. He was the best part of the Resident Evil show by a landslide, that's the first thing I've ever watched him in. Just a great actor and very charismatic, can't believe he died so young. Rest in peace..."
The Frozen Dead,Just bingeing Fringe again at this moment and saw this whilst briefly scrolling. Great presence.
The Frozen Dead,"Seeing him first in Lost, then Fringe, then hearing his distinctive voice in Destiny and Horizon, aw man RIP 😭"
The Frozen Dead,He was great on the Comedy Central show Corporate
The Frozen Dead,"This is so sudden, damn.

He has such an iconic voice and charisma.

I also had no idea he was 60."
The Frozen Dead,"Rest in peace chief 😞

He was fantastic, I thought my wife was pranking me ffs."
The Frozen Dead,I’m fucking gutted. Commander Zavala :(
The Frozen Dead,"The Wire, Fringe, even a bit role in Lost.  Great actor, gone way way way too soon.  RIP."
The Frozen Dead,So weird. He *just* posted yesterday chilling with his dogs.
The Frozen Dead,I hope he finally gets his iconic slave role warp speed don’t Reading Rainbow him!
The Frozen Dead,Well my day is officially ruined. Fuck
The Frozen Dead,"So out of nowhere, and he was only 60? What the fuck.."
The Frozen Dead,"He will be missed. When an artist dies young, it feels like the world has been robbed of their talent. As others have said: The Wire, Fringe, Horizon, John Wick...you know what all of those would be without Lance? Not as good."
The Frozen Dead,That's way too young.
The Frozen Dead,Fuck this hits hard. Cedric was great.
The Frozen Dead,"Oh man, that absolutely sucks. He was always the type of guy I’d sit up for when he popped into something. Very sad to hear this one :("
The Frozen Dead,"This is so unbelievably sad. He added a level of professionalism and class to every character he played that was unparalleled in his genre. Rest In Peace, you won’t be forgotten."
The Frozen Dead,"We just lost Michael K. Williams, now Lance too?  And both way too young..."
The Frozen Dead,"What the heck man?!  He is awesome, has majors roles in the John Wick movies, he was a major character in the Horizon games x 2, and also he was the main character in the Resident Evil Netflix show.  What a loss.  RIP."
The Frozen Dead,"Funny how different community know him by different roles..

/r/television - The Wire, Fringe, Oz, Lost

/r/PS5 - Horizon games

/r/XboxSeriesX - Destiny, Quantum Break

/r/movies - John Wick and Wire


Same article showing up on different communities but the title reflects how they know him best."

[Rip Agent Clappers](https://youtu.be/d-n81Pl-zm0)"
The Frozen Dead,I know it’s probably been mentioned but he was great in Fringe. RIP
The Frozen Dead,"60!! Wtf, that’s heartbreaking. I always got excited when I saw him in a role. He really added strength to the characters he played. Gonna rewatch Fringe in his honor"
The Frozen Dead,"Well fudge.  RIP Zavala, may your light always shine on!"
The Frozen Dead,"Damn. I just watched the Toys R Me Funny or Die skit he did a few days back:

https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=GU-2C8Ec6co"
The Frozen Dead,"A damn shame.  He killed it in every role he had, regardless of medium."
The Frozen Dead,Literally watching fringe as I read this ..
The Frozen Dead,God fucking damn
The Frozen Dead,"Fucking what. God damn it, today sucks. Reddick was great in everything I've seen him in, this is a huge loss."
The Frozen Dead,"My god this shocked me. How awful, he still had a lot to give. Rest in peace sir, god this was way too soon."
The Frozen Dead,His deadpan delivery as the hotel manager was what sold the John Wick film as humor and not just action. He also voiced the dragon in Vox Machina season 2.
The Frozen Dead,"Truly heartbreaking news. I've been a fan since I saw him on Fringe nearly 15 years ago. He was great on there. And then of course he was incredible on The Wire (only watched it for the first time a few years ago). Not to mention how versatile he was, because of course he's in the John Wick movies, but he played one of my favorite characters in the Horizon video game franchise. What a loss. Condolences to his loved ones. 😔"
The Frozen Dead,He’s so amazing in ‘Corporate’ on Comedy Central. Dude had range.
The Frozen Dead,Dude never got his iconic slave role. :(
The Frozen Dead,"I don't usually get emotional over celebrity deaths but this one hurts. Gonna go watch The Wire for a bit. RIP Lance, thank you for all your work."
The Frozen Dead,Fuck today
The Frozen Dead,He had the best strut. RIP Lance
The Frozen Dead,"No, no, no. Love this actor.  Hollywood just suffered a massive loss. 😢"
The Frozen Dead,"Fuck. I've just been rewatching Fringe, which he's so good in."
The Frozen Dead,"Damn shame. He had that ""cool factor"" that most people just don't."
The Frozen Dead,"He seemed to play the same character over and over again, but that was okay because that character was AWESOME."
The Frozen Dead,"He was a phenomenal actor who crushed it in tons of different roles across movies, TV, and video games, but I will always think of The Wire when I think of Lance Reddick. He actually read for the parts of both McNulty and Bubbles before the producers asked him to come back and read for Daniels. It's hard to imagine how different the show would have been if he'd been playing one of those characters instead of Daniels, but that just speaks to how iconic his performance was.

RIP Mr. Reddick. You will be missed."
The Frozen Dead,"Whoa..

I just finished rewatching Fringe, a towering presence among the series that influenced me growing up; I hadn’t revisited the series since it ended.

I’d totally forgotten that originally, his role was positioned as sort of just another “overbearing superior who demands results but underestimates the heroes”-type character, not unlike Agent Skinner from The X-Files (Fringe’s chief inspiration).

But almost immediately, this characterization in the pilot disappears in subsequent episodes. Instead, Agent Broyles defies the archetype and proves a capable leader who genuinely cares about his people. Lance Reddick brought so much complexity and emotion to a character that, despite a hardened, sometimes cold exterior, had a warmth and sense of vulnerability that made him so much more.

I wish he hadn’t been pigeonholed into roles seemingly written as “Lance Reddick-types,” but I’ll always remember seeing him take what could’ve been just a gag, and turn it into a brilliant performance of hilarious euphoria and wonder, followed by existential crisis and finally total emotional vulnerability when, in a later season, Broyles is accidentally dosed with LSD.

RIP

The Frozen Dead,"Jesus that’s terrible news, such a great actor. I’ve never seen him give a bad performance."
The Frozen Dead,"Haven't watched The Wire yet (I know), but his arc on Oz was great! RIP"
The Frozen Dead,"Literally just finished watching the wire for the first time.

RIP"
The Frozen Dead,Terrible news:( RIP
The Frozen Dead,60 is far too young.
The Frozen Dead,"He made Corporate, his cold steely way of saying the most absurd things was so funny.

Really sad to hear this"
The Frozen Dead,He was great in Corporate too
The Frozen Dead,"Just watched the first John wick last night after thinking I should re-watch all 3 to get in the mood for chapter 4 & I think besides John my favourite character is Charon, Lance just had such a presence whether it be something so simple as him saying hello to JW or him calling his room to tell JW the hotel has had a noise complaint.

The John Wick franchise will be a little less awesome now that Lance is gone. RIP"
The Frozen Dead,I loved him in Fringe and was looking forward to seeing him in the Percy Jackson franchise. So shocking and sad. And only 60?! :(
The Frozen Dead,"Ahh man! Lance had one of the smoothest voices in Hollywood, and his presence on screen was undeniably cool. He will definitely be missed. 

I was already planning a John Wick movie marathon this weekend, looks like there’s an even stronger reason to rewatch now. The Continental will not be as cool without him."
The Frozen Dead,RIP to a legend. “Bend to far you’re already broken.”
The Frozen Dead,He was great in Fringe
The Frozen Dead,Just finished a rewatch of the Wire. RIP Daniels.
The Frozen Dead,"No way!! What the fuck?!

Awful news, he was fantastic. Rest in power Lance."
The Frozen Dead,Damn. I just started watching Fringe a couple weeks ago. His performance was superb. We lost one of the greats today. RIP.
The Frozen Dead,"Crazy how I was just rewatching the wire am at the second episode, look at Reddit for a moment then see this. His voice is so recognisable in some games too. He did a awesome job in Horizon. Not to mention the movies he has been in."
The Frozen Dead,"WHAT THE FUCK!!!
my god this news just breaks my heart!! i just started watching the tv series ""Fringe"" a couple of weeks ago (i'm already well into season 2!) and i love it!
60 years old is not old! i just stunned and wrecked at this news. Mr. Reddick was EXTREMELY talented! he was an excellent actor.

my condolences to his family, friends and fellow fans.
RIP"
The Frozen Dead,"OMG ! I last saw him on resident evil and despite many people here tank the show. I enjoyed it especially Lance Reddick performance. He did a few roles and did them well.

Also 60 is very young and I always wonder what is the meaning of death by natural causes. 60 is not natural."
The Frozen Dead,I STRONGLY DISAGREE WITH THIS!
The Frozen Dead,"I'm not even sad about this, I'm angry. Guy seemed healthy as a horse and he's much younger than my parents. 60 is too fucking young to just die of natural causes. It's such a 'fuck you' that it ever happens. 


Great actor in every role I've seen him in. Even if he never got his iconic slave role like Levar Burton. RIP."
The Frozen Dead,Gone too soon. Can't believe it. may he rest in peace.
The Frozen Dead,"He was just promoting his new movie.  Had to Google this after I saw this headline and it is very jarring to see this news alongside an article of him doing a very recent interview. 

Wow.  RIP"
The Frozen Dead,"I gave this lovely man a twice weekly Covid test in October,2021. HBO studio out in the Valley. Told him I loved The Wire, he told me to watch Bosch. I was impressed by his calm gracious vibe.RIP."
The Frozen Dead,Noooo!  I loved him!
The Frozen Dead,"Aw man this sucks. His presence in the Wire was incredibly powerful, I don't think anyone could have played his role like him. He will be missed."
The Frozen Dead,Fuuuuuuuuck. I always wanted him to take over as the host of jeopardy.
The Frozen Dead,"Damn so young. Amazing actor and amazing voice.

I wonder what they’ll do for the third Horizon game. Hopefully he recorded some lines."
The Frozen Dead,RIP legend
The Frozen Dead,No!  Always loved him.  What terrible news.
The Frozen Dead,So many amazing roles but he’ll always be the boss in Corporate for me. Absolutely hilarious performance. Please check it out if you haven’t seen it. RIP.
The Frozen Dead,I was just watching “Fringe” last night
La Mante,"One tidbit. The young cop is played by Fred Testot. He was the second part of the (french) famous comic duo ""Omar et Fred"". Omay being Omar Sy from ""The Intouchables"" and also Jurassic World or lest X-Men."
La Mante,[deleted]
La Mante,"***[POSSIBLE SPOILERS!]***

Enjoyed it, but didn't love the morose, flat performance of the main cop (la Mante's son). After his third or fourth pained, contrived refusal to just tell his wife the fucking truth about his mother, shit got old.

Also, this series required more suspension of disbelief than anything I've watched in the last few years — from the extremely good / young looks of the original serial killer to the ultra-swanky mansion where she was kept during her temporary release, and right down to the attempted execution of a grown man in a washing machine ... So much unrealistic, even idiotic scripting. (But I admit, I watched it till the end!)"
La Mante,I liked the premise but think Glacé is better. The german dub of La Mante is plain awful which does not help either. 
La Mante,"Just finished this last night... It was so good.

I used to not give anything not in English a second look (I absolute hate voice dubs, and I'm not a huge fan of subtitles,) but between this and Dark, Netflix is changing my thinking there. "
La Mante,need some dope ass francophone netflix ogs in the next year - anyone know if any are in production?
La Mante,Another one? There's Glace too.
La Mante,It was pretty good.  Got overly dramatic at some points.  Good twist.
La Mante,Please tell me I can watch it subbed. The dubbing in Dark really fucked up
La Mante,"It is unusual, compelling, and has a couple of twists and turns that I didn't see coming. I'm only 4 of 6 episodes in though, so there is a chance it goes off the rails. I doubt it, seems like a smart, confident team is behind it."
La Mante,"I have waaaay too many crime drama shows on my watchlist that I haven't seen yet, about half of them are Netflix ""originals"". I always get distracted by something else though, I may just need to pick one out and binge watch it. So many of them have are  not heavily marketed so it's hard to find a good critical reception of them."
La Mante,"Wow. I remember her. Carole Bouquet was a Bond girl, playing opposite Roger Moore in ""For Your Eyes Only."""
La Mante,"[spoiler](#s ""If transphobic cliches don't ruin your viewing pleasure."")"
La Mante,"I'm two episodes in. This is what I keep thinking: ""Damien looks like skinny Chris Christie.""
The show is good. But that's a difficult workaround. "
La Mante,"He's a good actor; there's a little bit of Clive Owen about him.
"
La Mante,"Just finished watching this...good show....

Testot looked like the spawn of nicolas cage and either trey parker or the other guy from the it crowd"
La Mante,"He was a standout in 2015's ""Burnt,"" with Bradley Cooper. "
La Mante,"Heeeeeeeeere’s, Freddy!"
La Mante,"The mansion was completely over the top, plus given her crimes, having only one guy guarding her seems improbable. 
Those washing machines didn't look big enough to hold a child. "
La Mante,"La mante's escape was so contrived I can't continue watching. 

Why would they only have one guard? 

Why would he give her mouth to mouth and not just chest compressions? I'm pretty sure they don't even use mouth to mouth any more. 

Why would we swallow the pill she puts in his mouth instead of spitting it out? 

Why give her a capsule for the headache and not a tablet?

Why would they not have a camera in the bathroom? I know inmates in general population have no expectation of privacy so why would a prolific serial killer?

For someone so dangerous, the police really didn't seem to concerned about her escaping. 

Jesus Christ, only ONE person guarding her??? "
La Mante,"Come on, they make big washing machines.  And I'm sure they'd rather the government use those chateaus than tear them down.  Really, the most unbelievable part of the show was why they couldn't find an older picture of former Chanel model and Bond girl Carol Bouquet where she wasn't so ridiculously gorgeous."
La Mante,"They both seem very similar, plot-wise. I liked Glacé well enough, but I'm not sure I'm up for another round of the same thing."
La Mante,"How is the german dub of Glace? I'm interested in both, but may forget La Mante if the dub is really as awful as most people say. I watched the trailer of La Mante and the dub seemed ok..."
La Mante,"*Au Service de la France* (aka *A Very Secret Service*) is supposedly getting a second season... soon-ish? Which I think Netflix would have exclusive rights to outside of France, so hopefully that's happening"
La Mante,"Not sure if there are any new ones in production but Witnesses (Les Témoins) and The Break (La Trêve) are pretty good. The first one is from France the second from Belgium. 

But I wouldn't mind more variety as like La Mante they're both cop/investigative shows."
La Mante,It is subbed on Netflix in the U.S.
La Mante,Why not just watch dark subbed lol. 
La Mante,I watched Dark subbed as well.  I'm in USA tho.
La Mante,note that it's a not a Netflix show.
La Mante,"I have a lot on my list/queue too.  I'm lucky that I have two friends whose opinions I trust, recommending ones they've seen. We are being flooded with crime tv, it is rather overwhelming."
La Mante,"Transphobic, such a stupid word. Phobic means fear. Just because somebody realizes the obvious truth that somebody who denies reality has a mental problem doesn't make him anythingphobic. It's the people that want to deny reality and say they are something they are not that have a phobia of reality. 

Being a homosexual is understandable and respectable. You can like whatever the hell you want. Wanting to be something that you're not is a common fantasy. Expecting the entire world to pretend you're something you're not, and calling them phobic when they point out the obviousness of the dick hanging between your legs, that's squarely in mental-issue territory. 

I believe that you can like whatever you want, have sex with whoever you want, dress however you want, and get as much surgery as you want. Cut it out, or have one made for you, it's all up to you. And nobody should discriminate you for it, nor make you the target of violence of persecution for that. That is my belief regarding this whole issue. But no, that is not enough for you, you have a problem, something in your head isn't right, so it isn't enough to dress how you want or pretend to be whoever you want to be, you need others to validate you. So you keep pushing the envelope. Now it's ""transphobic"" to even recognize that somebody used to be a man? What's next, is it gonna be discrimination if you don't feel like fucking a dude in drag too?

Your right to call yourself Martha stops where my right to remember you used to be John starts. 

Finally, not everything is about you and your dick issues. It's a great fucking series, enjoy it for what it is. There are  a million fictions about kiddie fuckers, and 9 out of 10 they are man. There are a million fictions about drug-dealers, and 9 out of 10 it's some Colombian named Ramón. There are a million fictions about a murder in a mansion, and 9 out of 10 times it's the butler. I don't see you getting outraged about that. Is that man/Colombian/butler-phobic? No, because it's fiction, let them exploit whatever fucking stereotype they want. "
La Mante,"The dub of Glace is fine. La Mante sounds just unprofessional. Most voices just do not seem to fit the character, it sounds artificial. All voices have the same volume no matter how far ""away"" the person speaking is. Lack of atmospheric audio and so on. Don't get me started about the voice of the chief inspector who has a wannabe tough guy voice in german, totally pathetic.  I might give it a try in french with subs."
La Mante,est ce bien? quel genre?
La Mante,Fuck yeah. I love the humor and feel to this show so much.
La Mante,I'm watching the Break right now and it's pretty decent so far.
La Mante,Audio options are English or English
La Mante,"Netflix has been shamelessly re-badging hundreds of shows as ""Netflix Originals"" when they often seem to have had nothing to do with them, and are just acquisitions."
La Mante,"Ouais, je l'aime beaucoup. La série se passe dans les années soixantes, donc la Guerre froide, la fin du colonialisme, le conflit en Algerie sont tous des grandes parties de l'histoire. Le personnage pricipal est un nouveau espion dans le service secret de la France; la première épisode est son premier jour de travail. C'est une comédie d'espionnage, comme si *Mad Men* a rejoint avec *Get Smart*

La première saison est trés trés bonne, je la recommonde."
La Mante,Yeah I'd say The Break is the best one of the 2 shows
La Mante,"Really? I finished watching the show with my parents just two days ago, subbed through the whole thing! Thats weird. "
La Mante,"Often these shows would never get made if Netflix wasn't there to help fund them at the beginning for rights outside original production company's home country. So, they very much have something to do with them. "
La Mante,"Yeah that's thrown me off a few times! Seems they attach that NO on shows that are exclusive to Netflix, is that correcT? Like Black Mirror or Peaky Blinders?!

(Why on Earth is this being downvoted? Genuinely curious...?)"
La Mante,"ooooh les soixantes... j'aime les films de passé et Mad Men est littéralement mon émission de télé favori... wow - ma francais c'est mediocre et i jeux un francophone émission de télé a regarder, alors.. c'est génial! 


Aussi, comment est mon français? I really tried to reply in my best french haha, anyway je vais les regarder!"
La Mante,I'm also watching Bordertown.  It's pretty decent also.  
La Mante,Oh now what the fuck. Unless they in the last two weeks released the German audio... Or didn't release it in Canada.
La Mante,"People generally keep track of shows on the basis of who greenlit the creative pitch because it gives some idea of the level of quality that can be expected. Simply doing a financial acquisition for exclusive streaming rights isn't comparable to creation and full production, and to label that ""very much have something to do with them"" is a gross exaggeration. Many of these shows are *already made* before Netflix acquires their streaming rights. 

There is a massive difference between Netflix being pitched a show and saying 'yea, we want to fully fund this and help its development' versus 'ok this looks good enough to buy streaming rights for'. Let's not pretend otherwise."
La Mante,and more often then not they would get made / have already been made. There's sooo many shows they just slap the netflix sticker on
La Mante,I think Black mirror is different since they actually are producing new episodes
La Mante,"Netflix Originals seems to mean 1 of 3 things:
1 shows created and produced by Netflix.
2 shows that were on regular tv/cable, and Netflix chose to produce more seasons.
3 shows that Netflix is the sole distributer of.
"
La Mante,Pretty much correct. it even differs per country. If a series is exclusive in a certain country then it's NO in that country.
La Mante,"From what I can tell, ton français est bon! J'apprends la langue aussi! It can be hard to know if what I'm writing makes sense or not, mais j'essaie

Une problème, il n'y a aucun sous-titres français pour la série (mais il y en a en anglais). Je les trouve très utiles pour la compréhension, ainsi elle était un peu difficile de comprendre de temps en temps. Bonne chance! J'espère que tu vas l'aimer"
La Mante,"Awesome, thanks for the recommendation. 

I wish Netflix made it easier to find foreign language shows. Having the titles translated doesn't help at all."
La Mante,"Check again, I'm in Canada too and it's showing me 5 audio options (English, French, German, Italian, and Spanish) along with the subs for each language"
La Mante,Except Netflix is often a critical part in that greenight. Their cash is needed to make the show happen.  They buy the right to call it an original.
La Mante,"It does makes sense, your French is very good (native French speaker here). A few errors but nothing really bad or that makes it not understandable. "
La Mante,Ok!! I stopped watching but will resume in German
La Mante,"No, Netflix is not a critical part of the greenlight. If Netflix isn't a coproducer, the show is already greenlit. Netflix is at best an part of being able to sustain the show via sale of distribution rights *after the fact*. 

If you build a custom car with your own money and then later on I buy it from you so I can drive it in certain states, it wouldn't be accurate to say I ""very much had something to do with"" the creation or quality of the car. "
La Mante,"Ah, merci ! J'ai passé un mois à Montréal dans une programme d'immersion, l'été dernier. Chu capable de demander un café et parler à propos le hockey, mais pas beaucoup plus de ça"
La Mante,"there are deals where netflix comes in after the fact, but again many many deals that are done with netflix at the beginning, with their funding be a critical part of the deal.  These are the ones usually where they put the 'netflix original' label on them in some territories. "
La Mante,"Really? It's not a bad show, but nowhere near Hannibal level.
> Hannibal but far smarter"
La Mante,I enjoyed watching this too. Have you checked out other foreign dramas? The Method? El Ministerio Del Tiempo? Silver Spoon? The Sniffer? These are all great viewing also...
La Mante,You got a point! I mean the Hannibal movie with Jodie Foster. The Hannibal tv series is amazing *.*
La Mante,"I've watched part of The Dark, which is really good. Babylon Berlin is *jaw dropping* beautiful. The original version of Wallander is pretty good too. "

Dynasty,I remember seeing her name many times when watching Star Trek. Rest in peace and thanks for some great episodes.
Dynasty,"She was the first female director for Star Trek, and her episodes included:

>VGR's **Blink of an Eye** (the one with the sped up time planet)

>DS9's **In Purgatory's Shadow** (The one where Cardassia joins The Dominion and kicks off the entirety of the Season 5-7 Dominion War Arc)

>TNG's **Booby Trap** (The asteroid ancient ship)

>TNG's **The High Ground** (The terrorist faction that nearly forces a Saucer Separation)

>TNG's **Suddenly Human** (Picard finds a new son that tries to kill him, but not his actual son which was faked by a Ferengi in season 7)

>TNG's **Disaster** (Troi learns what it means to be a Commander, leading her to get promoted next season)

>TNG's **Imaginary Friend** (the only Child Episode that isn't annoying)

>TNG's **Face of the Enemy** (Deanna Troi is turned into a Romulan and Saves The Day)

>and TNG's **Lower Decks** (the spark that kicked off the new animated series)"
Dynasty,"I loved watching reruns of Hillstreet Blues. New York is Disneyland now. Let's say it all kids GENTRIFICATION IS GOOD.
NYC went bankrupt and even the US government thought it was too far gone for a bailout. That show is literally a gem if you're interested in history."
Dynasty,Disaster is one of my favorite bottle episodes of Trek. It’s a really well-done disaster movie riff.
Dynasty,Wow some of the absolute best TNG directed by her.
Dynasty,Need Yellowstone 2049
Dynasty,At this rate he's not gonna write a new movie till the next decade.
Dynasty,I can't wait for one of them to find the tunnel that let's them travel 33 years into the past and future.
Dynasty,So crazy that Taylor Sheridan started off as a background character (sheriff) on Sons of Anarchy. And now he's created a whole universe.
Dynasty,"Yellowstone: Primordial Years. 

Let’s beat this horse into oblivion."
Dynasty,"I really do enjoy Yellowstone, but I wish he would reign it in and give some more tightly written movies. His last two attempts weren’t very good."
Dynasty,So many lost years on this one family……guy makes good feature films too. Well used to
Dynasty,"Damn does this family ever have any chill, quiet years?"
Dynasty,This guy...
Dynasty,"Yellowstone : Infinity and beyond

Buzz Lightyear is Dutton Ranger in space"
Dynasty,"Sheridanverse is a phenomenon.  

I love Yellowstone. I do not even know why. My husband and I also cried with 1883, which was last year's best limited series.  

Open your hearts to the Duttons. Forget the ""good writing"" that this sub loves (although no one knows what that means) and enjoy this journey."
Dynasty,I didn't finish 1883 and couldn't finish the last season of Yellowstone with too much of the stories focusing on spinoffs also not interested in a Jimmy story line which sucks since I used to always look forward to a new episode of Yellowstone.
Dynasty,"I came to the thread to ask if 1883 was good, but instead I'm going to say yes. 

And with a Costner lookalike replicant it'd be a hit."
Dynasty,Yellowstone -1 introduces the multiverse.
Dynasty,"Which is a terrible shame, Hell or Highwater and Wind River are easily the best things he's ever done."
Dynasty,"Yeah, his TV shows are good for what they are.  He saw a niche that wasn't being served and he filled that, most if not all of his shows so far have been big hits.  I do feel his true talent lies in screenwriting though."
Dynasty,"There was a really good profile on him not too long ago where he was talking about that.  He was asking for more money for Season 3 of SoA.  BTW, I wouldn't call him a background character and he was a deputy, not the sheriff.  He was a pretty major character the first couple of seasons and I remember him being featured prominently in the trailers with Charlie Hunnam when the show first premiered.  Anyway, someone who he didn't identify said to him that actors like him were a dime a dozen and refused to give him a raise.  He got killed off so he could get out of the show.  I always wonder how that executive who told him that must feel today."
Dynasty,Back then they had to ride bison
Dynasty,He wrote 'Those Who Wish Me Dead' which came out just last year. He's still writing movies
Dynasty,Are his films good?
Dynasty,I thought 1883 was good for what it's worth
Dynasty,"Sicario is pretty fuckin great, too."
Dynasty,He got killed off terribly too. Kinda like Admiral Akbar did now that I’m remembering it.
Dynasty,"Wind River and Hell or Highwater (former directed by him) are excellent, Sicario a tight thriller directed by Villaneuve."
Dynasty,It told you what it was going to be and then it was that.
Dynasty,I would pin 75% of that movie on Dennis Villeneuve. Especially after seeing Sicario 2 and Those Who Wish Me Dead
Dynasty,I remember my jaw dropping like “No Way They Just Killed Him Like That”
Dynasty,just watched this. wow …. i’m happy this came out! the documentary brings a lot of things to light. i had never heard of any of these people before but it’s honestly not surprising. so many of these people try to use christianity as some kind of shield to hide behind while abusing and stepping on others. gross. i only with more would come to light because i’m sure this kind of thing is 10x more common than we notice publically. i do feel bad for the falwell’s kids though. hopefully they don’t turn out like their parents. seems like these behaviors / characteristics get passed down in some cases lol. i also like how the doc normalizes that men can be victimized too. definitely interesting to see. never wouldve watched it but a friend recommended it and i think it was worth watching.
Dynasty,Isn't Falwell the guy that banged his mom in an outhouse?
Dynasty,Ok why do people still go or send their kids to Liberty University?!?
Dynasty,i have no idea who the falwells are
Dynasty,"This documentary was absolutely amazing and I am so grateful for how well made, written and logical it was. This wasn't biased at all. This isn't fake news. This isn't fiction. This is real American history. True manipulation. True blackmail and buying ones way into center stage. How the overwhelming need of a Creator's favor and to feed the greed to live forever shows humans' most darkest side. These hypocrites Christian posers liars USE MONEY TO WEASEL LOBBY THEIR PERSONAL BELIEFS INTO OUR GOVERNMENT THAT RULES OUR LIVES. OUR INNOCENT LIVES. Special place in Hell for those who use the Mask of Good to do the Work of Evil. Thank you so much to Hulu for making this. Like wow.

Its fine to be kinky and have fetishes, just don't guilt rape people into it. And definitely don't charge other people for shit you partake in. There is so many levels how fucked up this person is and the absolute destruction from him undoing Roe vs Wade. Everything should be questioned now. If cases get overturned because someone in the case is fucked up or drunk, its thrown out. Ok so undo everything the past 4 years and give out uteruses power back."
Dynasty,So I watched…those people are pieces of shit. They make REAL Christians look bad. Jesus wouldn’t be part of the Republican Party. They are white supremacists and freaks. When you treat people like shit..it will come back to you. Just so gross…a lot of these evangelicals are liars and don’t even believe what they preach. It’s all a show.
Dynasty,"Love Rakontur's documentaries, this one looks as interesting as the rest. COCAINE COWBOYS, SCREWBALL, and THE U are some of my favorites of from them.


Another on of theirs on HBO that not many people saw called 537 VOTES is another must watch. It's their doc about the 2000 election and how the mayor of Miami sold out the city to state Republicans and basically started the snowball of shit we're in today."
Dynasty,"Really good and done so well.  Even if you don’t know Jerry Falwell, watch, learn, enjoy this craziness!"
Dynasty,Pretty ridiculous how this is just a pre-midterms smear attempt on Trump. Was pretty funny how hard they finagled the story to spotlight trump as much as possible. Was enjoying the matter of fact accounting until the agenda of the documentary became evident about half way in.
Dynasty,"America: Freedom of choice of religion...that then is used against you. Thats right, church and state are separate and there's over 30 different spiritualites to follow God, but money pays for Christianity to make laws and tell you how to live your lives to make them happy. They don't live their lives to make you happy, you must follow their beliefs no matter how much they lie, false God themselves or contradict everything they preach. Let America Burn."
Dynasty,"This documentary mostly focuses on the sexual hypocrisy of the Fallwell's (and gives a bit of the history of the family) but hardly gets into the the details of how much a scam artist Jerry Falwell is as well as the rape culture that exists at Liberty University. 


If you are interested in learning more about this, check out the podcast 'Gangster Capitalism: Season 3'. The bonus episodes which share some of the stories of the victims of rape and secual assault and how Liberty and the Lynchburg police basically covered this up/ignored it/and continued to traumatize the victims was shocking."
Dynasty,"I’m from Lynchburg and live with Liberty looming over me every day. When I was 13 Jerry Sr had his driver pull up next to me in a parking lot. He told me I was pretty and that I should go to liberty. I was thoroughly creeped out. Luckily I was with my mom. 

Jerry Jr didn’t tip my brother when he made sure to get everything in his wife’s complicated order done correctly. 

They’re all pieces of shit"
Dynasty,"I thought it was eye opening, too. I feel like the ‘Liberty Way’ rules were very clearly targeting/punishing women more than men, makes sense that the evangelicals would try and push that same agenda into our politics."
Dynasty,You wouldn't reasonably believe that...which is why we have free speech and parody related to celebrities.
Dynasty,"Jerry Falwell created the moral majority and before that, campaigned against MLK Jr as a pastor. He’s one of the OG televangelists. He died early because he had rules against drinking alcohol, so he’d drink entire bottles of NyQuil each night, as to get one by God.

Falwell Jr never believed like his dad did, he liked money and power and loves Donald trump and his brand of hate. Apparently, he also really likes to be a cuckold."
Dynasty,Is this the Liberty University family?
Dynasty,"That says more about you and your knowledge of the literal basics about American evangelicalism.

The Falwells are the face of the Southern Baptist Convention.  The SBC originated in the pro-slavery/white supremacy social order that led to the Civil War.  They're a faction that split from the rest of the American congregation of Baptist followers for these white supremacists ideals - aka because they removed themselves, they (and other like-minded Protestant sects) are largely why we have ""white churches"" and ""black churches"".

The SBC has been pro-slavery and pro-segregation and honestly pro-everything people complain about evangelicalism.  That's where the Falwells come in.

Since the wide-spread adoption of the television into every home in America AND the Civil Rights movement shifting attitudes in the US, the SBC has adopted televangelism to appear more desirable of a faith than they had been before.  Televangelists (or con artists, depending on your beliefs) preach over TV and in doing so receiving millions of dollars in checks mailed to them and use that money for religious based political and social activism/bribery/lobbying and stuffing the televangelist's own piggy bank.

Jerry Falwell was one of the first televangelists and co-founded the Moral Majority - the political muscle of the ""religious right"".  He also recognized the potential to make fistfuls of dollars as a founder of an evangelical university and thus founded Liberty University.  

His son, Jerry Falwell Jr., is the product of nepotism, corrupt and less competent than those before him.  He is also one of the largest reasons Donald Trump had (somehow) been rebranded  and inexplicably marketed as a savior of the American religious right prior to the 2016 elections."
Dynasty,"I kid you not, I had no idea who they were until Jerry Falwell years ago said mean things about the Teletubby Tinky Winky being gay."
Dynasty,"It really was so good. I thought it would probably just be a tabloid-y kind of sex scandal, but it was really about the intersection of sex, religion, power and politics in this country. Well done."
Dynasty,i had to sort of laugh at their relationship. i mean if becky doesnt have a boyfriend now - not sure how happy they can be.
Dynasty,How is it not related? Cohen leveraged those compromising photos to get Falwell’s endorsement in Trump’s election…
Dynasty,The story is about Falwell and they can't ignore the power he received by being associated so closely with T.
Dynasty,"100%! even down to the way this guy threw his wife under the bus as “having an affair” when he probably wanted to be part of it too. or was for all we know lol. all the power to anyone who wants to do it but don’t turn around and point at everyone else afterwards. this is probably just the tip of the iceberg for people like this. and it just goes to show how the whole obsession with “christianity / christian values”, etc. in politics is just such a scam."
Dynasty,"> so he’d drink entire bottles of NyQuil each night

Huh, didn't know purple drank had extended its reach beyond the hip-hop community."
Dynasty,"> he died early

Not really — he died at 73. Not saying that’s decrepit, but it’s not like most would say “oh, he was so young.” Usually, assholes live forever."
Dynasty,Oh snap.  You gonna watch??
Dynasty,"I get why its a scandal and its definitely not moral, but honestly, filming his wife have sex with some younger guy seems pretty tame compared to what i was expecting it to be. doesnt really seem worth a documentary."
Dynasty,Yup.  BTW calling them a dynasty is puffing them up a little too much.  They were not well-regarded in Lynchburg and the Liberty board of directors was having problems with him well before the poolboy came to light.
Dynasty,"Despite being a christian (im probably what reddit likes to label a christian fundamentalist), i pay no attention to TV evangelists. As far as I am concerned they are all ""wolves in sheeps clothing"" as the bible says. 

thats probably why i'm uninformed about these people. I'm also not any flavor of Baptist."
Dynasty,"Honestly, the Falwels aren’t really talked about much anymore. I think it’s reasonable that anyone under 25 might not know who they are, simply because they haven’t come up much in the past 15 years, besides that little blip in the news about one member’s sex life.

And while cucking is unconventional, it does sound like it was consensual all around, so it was barely a scandal."
Dynasty,Bravo. Very well written.
Dynasty,So Democrats?
Dynasty,oh he was that guy
Dynasty,😂😂😂
Dynasty,"I had a boss that was evangelical. Had many kids. I overheard him tell someone he was going to “love me into the kingdom,” as in try and get me to be faithful like him and many of the people I worked with. But behind closed doors, he would make advances, talk to me about sex preferences, toys, ask me to wear certain clothes he liked.

If these people would stop trying to appear so pious and just be unapologetic dirtbags like the rest of us, life would be so much easier!"
Dynasty,At least the hip-hop community has the decency to add sprite to it. Drinking NyQuil Neat is just ungodly
Dynasty,"Hell no, it's the day after Halloween.  I'm still gonna watch scary movies and maybe World Series baseball.  I already despise these people on the merit of their character, ethics, and actions.  I don't need any more reasons and don't get particular measure from anything involving them.  I'd rather they disappear from the social consciousness.  Plus, a sex scandal only cheapens their poor merit  and corruption - it's a distraction from what really matters."
Dynasty,The scandal isn’t that he has a fetish. This dude and his family have had a huge negative impact on our country and spread hate and misinformation. They’re awful self righteous hypocrites. The cuckolding is just one minor aspect. It’s full on corruption from one of the highest profile conservative evangelicals. There is more to uncover than nude photos.
Dynasty,"You have the right mix of ignorance and persecution complex, that checks out, you are in fact a fundie"
Dynasty,"Lol, I'm Catholic. That has no bearing on me knowing who they are. JFC tv, either the numerous shows they had. Or perhaps SNL having parodies of them. Or...the news."
Dynasty,[deleted]
Dynasty,The documentary was more interesting than I expected though as it does talk more about how people’s knowledge of the “affair” was leveraged for political gains.
Dynasty,"As a Dodgers fan, I’m pretty sure the baseball season is over. It ended on Saturday and they just haven’t had any games since, right?"
Dynasty,persecution complex? based on what?
Dynasty,"not sure why you're so pissy with me for not knowing something. you seem upset that falwell has had some effect on american religiosity, then you find someone who hasnt been affected by them at all and you get even more irritated? you make no sense."
Dynasty,"Definitely, Saturday was the last day of Baseball until April. 

Source: Braves Fan"
Dynasty,Plenty of time for reminiscing about iconic Dodgers moments of the past.  I'm particularly fond of Matt Stairs.
Dynasty,Only like 160 days till pitchers and catchers report!
Dynasty,"“CW cancels 7 shows,” and promptly names six “…and more.”

“In the Dark.”  “In the Dark” was the “more.”  This isn’t the black-and-white season of “Gilligan’s Island.”  Hope I saved someone a click."
Dynasty,And yet Riverdale lives
Dynasty,"Am I having a time travel stroke? Charmed, Roswell, and the 4400 have been canceled for a long time."
Dynasty,Whatever happened to the 100 prequel?
Dynasty,Charmed?  Dynasty?  What year is this?
Dynasty,"What sucks is, the CW heads knew this going out of business was happening and they didn't give all these productions a heads up(well sans the ones that were in a first season). 

So many unconcluded shows."
Dynasty,Feeling thankful we got long runs and proper endings for Crazy Ex Girlfriend and Jane the Virgin
Dynasty,They really did a bad job with promoting. I loved the original 4400 and did not even know it had a remake.
Dynasty,"I bet they bring back ""Cheaters"""
Dynasty,"They do desperately need some quality control. I'm still amazed 'All American' is not only alive but has a spinoff, the show was dead in the water during its freshman run, no one was watching but that Netflix deal was worth its weight in gold for CW shows."
Dynasty,What year is it??
Dynasty,Im sad. Dynasty was my guilty pleasure show 😭
Dynasty,"Amazing what happens when all of a sudden the parent companies say ""Look, we are going to sell this shit, we are done with a network that loses money every year since it's founding""."
Dynasty,"Honestly surprised Legacies got cancelled, it always seemed to be doing well and had the built in... legacy. Naomi is not at all a surprise. In the Dark was great in season 1 but season 2 was meh and season 3 was a steep decline into crap and they wrote themselves into a corner with it. I'm surprised it even got the upcoming season. I had a bunch of shows from CW I watched but now that's down to 4 and with In The Dark not continuing past the upcoming season, that makes 3... and honestly I'm not expecting The Flash to last after next season either. Superman and Lois and Stargirl seem most likely to just move to HBO Max if they have to."
Dynasty,When all these cancellations are done every network is just gonna be reality TV and shows that pretend cops are heroes.
Dynasty,Really CW needs to cancel their entire lineup and try again.
Dynasty,I sometimes catch the end of some of CW’s shows as my local affiliate airs Seinfeld at 10:00 every night. Most of what the CW airs during the 9:00 hour is fucked up.
Dynasty,I actually liked Roswell. Bummed about that.
Dynasty,The only show I care about from this list is Legacies. My daughter and I's favorite show to watch together. The show was so fun with the monster of the week vibe. And they took their time to explore the dynamics between all the different characters really well.

Bonus Family,The trust fund bit was by far my favorite.
Bonus Family,"The whole bit with James where everyone just assumes he's gay, no matter how many times he insists otherwise."
Bonus Family,I love the show. So many hilarious moments. Sister Michael is fucking brilliant.
Bonus Family,"Watch Orla. Orla in the background, reacting, is brilliant."
Bonus Family,Remember that police scene with Liam Neeson. Oh for suffering Jesus
Bonus Family,"I think one of my favorite moments is in season one when Colm is over for dinner. 

He’s going on about something and they think he’s done talking, he starts up again, and Ma Mary just goes “Jesus wept” under her breath. 

Their dry, Irish humor is just so fantastic! I know the show is focused on the kids, but the comedy from all the adults involved just cracks me UP."
Bonus Family,"There’s a holiday special Bake Off episode with them, it’s a must watch."
Bonus Family,"I need to catch up on Seasons 2 and 3. Season 1 has some great lines. I like the end of episode 1 when they all get called into Sister Michael's office:

Michelle: ""Nobody actually gets expelled. Rhonda Gallagher hasn't even been expelled and she's in the IRA.""

Erin: ""I'd say that's probably why.""

Then Clare dobs them all in:

Clare: So it had nothing to do with me! Yes, okay, I was there. I admit that, but I didn't do anything. It was Michelle. It was all Michelle. I'm not going down for something I didn't do. If anyone deserves to get punished, it should be Michelle.

Sister Michael: Well I think it's safe to say, we all just lost a bit of respect for you there, Clare."
Bonus Family,"James gets hate online?! He’s so nice to everyone though, I don’t see a reason to hate him. I think I teared up when he was about to leave but ended up staying"
Bonus Family,As someone who is Irish and grew up in the 80s/90s (80s baby) it definitely was nostalgic and brought out some big feelings and big laughs. I can related too well to some bits and cringed. Lol. But I think they also captured the troubles well and how it affected their lives.
Bonus Family,"The Uncle Colm with Liam Neeson scene was the best. I had never laughed this hard before. 

And the show in itself is incredibly well written. 10/10 will recommend"
Bonus Family,What business have you with Seamus!?
Bonus Family,"""everyone keeps using the word wee for things that aren't even very small!"" 

-James"
Bonus Family,I think I like Gerry (the dad) and Joe (the grandad) the best. I think they have some of the best lines or encounters. With each other and with other characters.
Bonus Family,"My favorite ep is when Mary ""killed"" her Aunt 😂 Almost died laughing lol

*""How's the wicked witch of the northwest?""*

Other fave quotes:

""Killing nuns now, is it?"" 

""WINKING? At your age?! Christ, I feel SICK!""

*When Erin thought Claire was into her when she came out as a lesbian* ""I'm not interested in you like that, look at the state of you"""
Bonus Family,"The bit with James in the chippy is hilarious. The way he says ITS MUCH, MUCH TOO GREASY! and the faces on the other girls crack me up. I think Orla even covers her ears.

And of course Dennis' GET OUT! 

Sister Micheal is a blessing. The way she hates Father Peter. Dose!"
Bonus Family,Orla is hilarious. Her dance act where she just stepped up onto a single step was beautiful
Bonus Family,"Uncle Colm is my favourite, just phenomenal dead pan. 

It reminds me so much of A Moody Christmas an Australian mini series with a similar Uncle Terry character who cannot stop giving people street directions or enquiring about which route they took to get there. Another show that captures a particular cultural ‘normal’ view of life."
Bonus Family,"“Am I dead? Is this my wake?” 
Love that show"
Bonus Family,"This is a fact.

It’s 3 perfect seasons - with a 12/10 finale bit

It’s wholesome and sad and funny and perfect"
Bonus Family,"i’ve re watched the first two seasons probably at least 20 times in the past year and a half. it’s easy to just have on repeat and play in the background. it’s short and sweet, but i’m still catching things i missed. truly an amazing show!!!"
Bonus Family,"Yes, the show has so much to offer. Satisfying character development, laughs abound and of course some sweet tender looks at the humanity of the family during “The Troubles”. Very unique."
Bonus Family,"It’s one of the best pilots of any show. 

James not being able to use the teachers bathroom. The old nun that steals from the girls and then Michelle’s mom saying “sorry I’m late they shut down the bridge. I told them to let me risk it but didn’t”"
Bonus Family,"Having grown up in that part of the world at that time  (I'm a couple of years older than the characters portrayed in the show) there are many wee details that are absolutely spot on.

For example, in one episode there is a mention of a kebab shop in Coleraine - Abrakebabra. Well that was a real place that a mate of mine ran...."
Bonus Family,Love Sister Michael!!
Bonus Family,"I was recently thinking uncle Colm's monologue about Tommy Duddy eating paper is one of the funniest things I've seen in a long time, I was genuinely howling at that"
Bonus Family,truly one of the funniest and best shows in recent memory.  husband and i had to watch with subtitles on since we're american.  it managed to take a difficult and dark situation and make it absolutely hilarious -- charming and beautiful and bittersweet.  all the characters and the actors who played them were phenomenal.  i wish more of my friends would watch this so i could talk about it with them.
Bonus Family,I’ve been to Ireland twice to see family and explore and during my last trip while in Derry we caught them filming the episode the president visited lol. It was an awesome experience and now whenever I show people the episode I tell them “I was right there off screen!” Lol
Bonus Family,"I ugly-cried at the series finale- I was totally incapacitated. The perfect blend of hope, trepidation, and just extreme sadness to realize the toll that the troubles have taken on their adolescence - a transformative bit of TV."
Bonus Family,"It took me like 2 years, but when I finally gave it a chance, it had some really solid moments, and reminds me a lot of Father Ted in the comedic delivery and hijinx"
Bonus Family,Probably the best comedic written show since Arrested Development. It bums me out that I only know like 2 other people that have watched it
Bonus Family,"I’m American, but was in High School (catholic all girls high school, even) during the early 90’s, so this show is absolutely gold to me. 

The writing is brilliant, the actors are phenomenal, and it’s just so, so fucking funny. I’ve watched the whole thing through countless times, and I always find something new to laugh at."
Bonus Family,I agree I love Derry girls one of the funniest shows. I binged the first two season when I was sick with Covid and it cheered me up like no other show could. Also I think Sister michael is one best characters on any sitcom ever.
Bonus Family,Now that it's over I need Derry Girls to become like The Sopranos where every discussion thread just devolves in to exchanging quotes because they make me so happy.
Bonus Family,i want more Sister Michael.
Bonus Family,"Just started this last, loved the first episode"
Bonus Family,Uncle Colm telling the story of having his car stolen…. Brilliant!
Bonus Family,Sister George Michael stole the show.
Bonus Family,Show is absolutely cracker
Bonus Family,"It really is amazing.  A sitcom about ordinary people in extraordinary times, funny in an intensely feminine way, just very very special.  I did feel like the last season lost a little bit of the perfection of the first two, as the stories got a little zanier (>!accidentally helping rob a school, getting sent across the border to clean up a house that felt haunted, planning an elaborately fancy 18th birthday party, going on TV to get backstage passes and then a parent dying, and honestly even the letter getting to Chelsea Clinton, which was a scene that's not likely to age as well as the rest of the show!<) and it felt less like ordinary life.  Regardless, BRILLIANT show and the >!voting!< storyline in the finale coupled with music choices that echoed the first episode's were absolutely brilliant, beautiful, ending on a real high."
Bonus Family,"I'm Australian and get tired very quickly of most US and UK comedy shows. Will always jump onto anything from a different English-speaking country that's offering something different. The Young Offenders (another Irish comedy) scratched that itch a few years ago and I still miss it. Derry Girls was a lockdown discovery that really got to me. Grew up during the 90's, so the soundtrack was 'chefs kiss'. 

It's a very different vibe, but I strongly recommend you check out Rosehaven. If you enjoy watching the hijinx of good friends living in a land that is foreign to you, Rosehaven is a delight. NZ is kicking Australia's ass when it comes to comedy lately, but Rosehaven is a timeless classic that will warm your heart. Two best friends writing, directing and acting as two best friends in a rural Australian town. Kinda like a far less crazy Schitt's Creek."
Bonus Family,100% agree. It's just a perfect encapsulation of time.
Bonus Family,Orla’s belief that lesbians were mythical creatures was one of the funniest through lines in any comedy episode I’ve watched.
Bonus Family,"The last season was so, so good! I'm so sad to see it go, but I think they ended it flawlessly."
Bonus Family,"One of the best series of the year, they are amazing, very smart way to connect the history to young audience, insanely funny and great cast."
Bonus Family,I love their accent
Bonus Family,"I agree with this whole heartedly. I saw a review for Derry Girls one that said it can make you nostalgic for a time and place you never lived, and that is so true. I've told myself ""it's illegal to be sad while watching Derry Girls,"" so it's something I've often put on when I'm feeling down as a pick me up. Reading these comments has me on the verge of tears with the desire to watch the show over for the first time, but instead, I'll have to survive with a rewatch. Uncle Colm stole the show at the police department and have used the phrase ""the wee lesbian"" soooo many times."
Bonus Family,Fuck-a-doodle-doo!
Bonus Family,Derry Girls and Father Ted are Ireland’s contributions to the pantheon of great TV.
Bonus Family,"It's really great, I wish we got more but I'll take it."
Bonus Family,Love it
Bonus Family,I can't believe I just got into this show and now it's over.
Bonus Family,"ETA to correct title of a recommendation 

It’s well written and has a great ensemble cast. They work really well together.  Michelle, Uncle Colm and Sister Michael are my favorites for different reasons 

If you enjoyed it, the same writer wrote London Irish which is pretty funny as well. A few of the same cast show up."
Bonus Family,"I really enjoyed it. But I'd be happy if they never revisit it. It really felt like they had a story that would take three seasons to tell and they told it, which imo is a lot better than just trying to keep making more episodes until it gets shit or people stop watching.   


Having said that I wouldn't complain if they did do more. That episode on the train where they couldn't figure out who the woman is was fucking gold."
Bonus Family,What are ya? Some sort of reverse paedophile?
Bonus Family,I’m a Derry Girl!!!!
Bonus Family,"I went to Catholic H.S. in the late 70's/early 80's in the USA and I feel like I went to school with these girls. 

No bombs, but the nuns and such are pretty accurate."
Bonus Family,"The relationship between Gerry and his FIL is my favourite thing. I love how it balances the lives of teenagers and the importance of the events happening around them, like the announcement of a ceasefire happening when they’re all off celebrating their prom."
Bonus Family,That's all well and good but when does the killer clown show up?
Bonus Family,100%.  it's fantastic.
Bonus Family,Such a great show. Just threw on the first ep on a whim and ended up binging the whole thing.
Bonus Family,"I agree, this show is fantastic. A film would be a great idea!"
Bonus Family,I loved it very much truly heartfelt and hilarious
Bonus Family,Brilliant show. One of those rare gems where every single actor steals every scene they’re in. That’s a rare trick and a treat to watch.
Bonus Family,I just started and it's a treat.
Bonus Family,You aren’t wrong there. I mean the show just has absolutely no misses. Every single episode is at least a 7/10.
Bonus Family,"Also, if you havent seen it, please check out Detectorists. Its another quirky show thats really heart-warming and 'cozy'. I think you'll like it!"
Bonus Family,i’m here for any and all poetic ruminations about this amazing show.
Bonus Family,"Yes to everything you said!

I am not sure I'd call it the best of all time, but it definitely gets  a place in my heart.

I also love to see a show about girls being human. They're not sexualized, they're not afraid to not be sexy and ever-cool. They're just normal humans. We need more shows like that in the US, because teens absolutely model what they see on TV.

I am not part of any Derry Girls discussion groups, so I didn't know James gets a lot of hate. I love him, he's obviously such a sweet guys, even with the mercilesscondemnation for being English. But the jokes about him are hilarious."
Bonus Family,Agreed 100%! When they performed as the Spice Girls I lost it 😂
Bonus Family,"I saw the cast on the Great British Baking Show and thought they had great chemistry, so I decided to watch Derry Girls. I’m almost done but I absolutely love it! The characters are so well written and hilarious. Michelle is definitely my favorite."
Bonus Family,The actresses show up for a Great British Bakeoff Christmas special that's pretty fun too.
Bonus Family,I am orla
Bonus Family,"My favorite episode is the one in S3 with Orla dancing her whole way home. It just cracks me up how in her own world she is, and she creates the little dance numbers."
Bonus Family,"Loved the relationship between Da Gerry and Joe. At first you think Gerry's just a doormat. Then you notice he puts up with the abuse because he loves his wife and daughters that much. Then you realzie he can see right through Joe, and has the respect to allow an old, emotionally-constricted man his dignity."
Bonus Family,[removed]
Bonus Family,"I've said this multiple times and I'm going to say it again because I just do truly mean it - Derry Girls is at the same level as The Office, one of the best shows of all time. Infinitely rewatchable and endlessly funny."
Bonus Family,"Watched it through for the first time a couple of weeks ago, and I fully agree. It has so much heart and so much character. Would have loved more episodes, but that would have prob ruined the magic."
Bonus Family,"I didn't grow up in the 80s/90s Northern Ireland but was born in the 90s and pretty sure I knew a girl who looked nearly identical to Michelle in secondary school. My parents told me stories about growing up during the troubles, Derry girls got it pretty much spot on you just get on with it. The example I love, that my dad told me, is a song written by the Northern Irish punk band Stiff Little Fingers, ""Bloody Sunday"" (released 3 years before U2 song by a similar name) which you think would be about the tragic event but no... It's about how there's nothing to do in Northern Ireland on Sunday! (No shops etc open on Sunday until I think the early 2000s)"
Bonus Family,"Sister Michael is absolutely fantastic, I love her dry responses to everything! 
It really does the nostalgia well. I grew up in the ROI during the 90s and 00s and remember the troubles and the atmosphere even down south was similar to the one up north.

Anyone planning a trip to Derry should go to the free Derry museum to learn about the troubles from a civilian point of view."
Bonus Family,"Wife and I loved it. Not sure who my favorite character is, though. Maybe Uncle Collum?"
Bonus Family,Jeez am I the only one who that it was... Average? Watched season one and thought it was like a juvenile Irish sex education. Hardly a thigh slapper.
Bonus Family,Honestly despise this show. The one girls acting and facial expressions kill me.
Bonus Family,"The last season wasn't as good as the previous ones. The series finale special was bad and the post-credits scene with Chelsea Clinton (yeah, that Chelsea Clinton) was down right embarrassing."
Bonus Family,"schitts creek - derry girls - ted lasso
imo the trifecta of perfect shows with literally nothing wrong with them, incredible writing, hilarious, not strung out etc"
Bonus Family,Season 3 was dog-shit. Felt like a half-hearted 'tie it up and forget about it' move. Season 1 and 2 were awesome though.
Bonus Family,Shame about the new season. I thought all the characters nedflandered.
Bonus Family,alrighty then
Bonus Family,Its great. They really need to make more episodes for a season.
Bonus Family,I thought the last season was a bit Shit but the first two were absolutely excellent
Bonus Family,[deleted]
Bonus Family,"Up to episode 4.  Struggling.

Its not objectionably bad, but basically all the main characters are annoyingly overacted.

I enjoyed then in-betweeners (obvs the most comparable…) and a wide range of other comedic styles but this just isnt doing it for me so far.  The only reason im oressing on is I keep seeing threads like this.

I seear, if I get halfway through aeason 2 and its still just as bad, Im coming for your pickle jars."
Bonus Family,"I just watched it.

Extremely generic, not of one of the best bits of television"
Bonus Family,L
Bonus Family,I was going to try it out but the trailer on Netflix seemed absolutely terrible
Bonus Family,"The trouble with saying what's best about Derry Girls? By the time you're done, you've listed everything about the show."
Bonus Family,"I laughed hard at the pilot, I didn’t laugh like that with the rest of the episodes but it is a good show to watch"
Bonus Family,Is this the girls version of the inbetweeners?
Bonus Family,Love the show. Is there a new season coming out?
Die Bülent Ceylan Show,"Jeez, she was an object of Fred Mertz's desires in I Love Lucy"
Die Bülent Ceylan Show,"Classic Flintstones joke: ""Oh Lollobrickida, your food I dig-it-da"". That's my entire experience with her as an actor, but the fact that I remember that gag decades later says something about her memorability."
Die Bülent Ceylan Show,"I was a kid watching ""Never So Few"" -- war movie with Frank Sinatra and Steve McQueen (the movie is watchable today but does not age well) -- anyway, there is a scene at a restaurant where Gina Lollobrigida sits down at the table with Frank and the other lead actors in the movie, and she lets her shoulder wrapping slip off, and Old Blue Eyes reaches into his coat pocket for a handkerchief to wipe his brow."
Die Bülent Ceylan Show,"Not sure if it’s finally finished yet, but the Blacklist was still on this year. We quit watching that show what feels like decades ago."
Die Bülent Ceylan Show,America's Funniest Home Videos. Over thirty years of watching people fall over. And this show seems to have a million even dumber knockoffs.
Die Bülent Ceylan Show,Especially Grey’s Anatomy. It was getting cheesy back when I stopped watching it which was the year of the writers’ strike (which launched the reality tv boom).
Die Bülent Ceylan Show,"Once animated shows get to like 8 seasons, they’ll literally go on forever. The Simpsons, Family Guy, American Dad, Archer…"
Die Bülent Ceylan Show,"The Walking Dead. I feel like they announced the show had one more season left like 5 years ago yet there are still more episodes left to air.

Also, Law & Order: SVU. How the hell is that still on? I thought should have ended when Christopher Meloni left the show but that was **ELEVEN YEARS AGO** and the show is still chugging along."
Die Bülent Ceylan Show,TWD
Die Bülent Ceylan Show,Flash. Everyone I know watched it. No one I know watches it now. Who is watching it anymore?
Die Bülent Ceylan Show,"Watch What Happens Live With Andy Cohen. He is absolutely the most obnoxious and annoying person on tv (including Corden). I watch Top Chef (there's a show that's been on for years-still good though) and the ads for WWHLWAC are the worst and they air constantly. Fortunately, I watch nothing else on Bravo, so I only see them when a new Top Chef Season is airing."
Die Bülent Ceylan Show,The Simpsons. Survivor. American idol
Die Bülent Ceylan Show,Any of the Law and Order shows still churning out new episodes.
Die Bülent Ceylan Show,"The Simpsons.

If you watched one episode every day, it would take two years to watch every episode. 

Even if the quality had not dropped, that is just too much Simpsons.

I think part of the appeal of every good show is that we get to see something new.

50% of people in the US were not born when The Simpsons first aired."
Die Bülent Ceylan Show,"SVU, NCIS, American Dad, and Bob's Burgers.  I can't remember a time anyone I know has ever said anything about any of those shows and they're all 10+ years old.  I've seen people mention the last two, especially BB, online but never anyone I personally know.  Other shows that are as old/older like The Simpsons, Family Guy, Grey's Anatomy, South Park, etc. have large fanbases that I know."
Die Bülent Ceylan Show,"SNL

The Simpsons

Family Guy

South Park 

All the garbage reality shows

All the garbage dating shows

The garbage competition shows like Survivor, TAR , that Ninja warrior one.

All the singing & dancing competition shows."
Die Bülent Ceylan Show,[deleted]
Die Bülent Ceylan Show,"Grey's Anatomy, they replaced M with plastic doll and nobody notice even now"
Die Bülent Ceylan Show,"Psych.

Out of all the TV shows that finish and end, Psych is the one that gets to have regular movies to followup the show. 

And we are damn lucky to have them :) 

I can't believe it hasn't died yet. But thank goodness it hasn't."
Die Bülent Ceylan Show,"what's that show with Tom Selleck? Whenever I turned the tv on in the last 10 years I saw his old arse sitting behind a desk, grumping about something"
Die Bülent Ceylan Show,"Rings of Power. 

The show is so offensively bad and the ratings are deservedly in the gutter, yet Amazon seems to determined to keep shoving that dog turd up a river anyway. 

It deserves to be cancelled immediately and everyone agrees."
Die Bülent Ceylan Show,[deleted]
Die Bülent Ceylan Show,[deleted]
Die Bülent Ceylan Show,"I agree on Grey’s Anatomy, should have ended at least 10 seasons ago.

The simpsons is another one, died for me 15 seasons ago at least."
Die Bülent Ceylan Show,I'm amazed at a lot of the stuff that's still on cable but Grey's Anatomy is the funniest one to me. I remember the ladies at work talking about this show and that felt like it was *ages* ago.
Die Bülent Ceylan Show,">Looks like a different show with only 3 original characters.

Kinda answered your own question there. Shows with rotating casts can go on forever since it's cheaper to hire new actors than to give the old ones raises."
Die Bülent Ceylan Show,"Greys anatomy, the simpsons and the walking dead. 

I found out a few months ago that the walking dead was still on and I got surprised because I thought that show ended like two years ago. I’m in my early 20s and I grew up watching both grey’s anatomy and the simpsons and they’re still on, it’s impressive."
Die Bülent Ceylan Show,America’s Next Top Model & Family Guy
Die Bülent Ceylan Show,Blue bloods
Die Bülent Ceylan Show,"NCIS, should have finished when Gibbs left."
Die Bülent Ceylan Show,The Walking Dead
Die Bülent Ceylan Show,Flash. The quality dropped so bad after the first 2-3 seasons
Die Bülent Ceylan Show,"I think the longevity of Grey's Anatomy throughout multiple cast changes has surprised me. I didn't think a show that is so character-centric would survive this long and so many changes. I stopped watching it regularly in season four, so it has been on much longer than I watched it.

Also Simpsons: I have not watched in two decades, but ending it at this point would be very strange."
Die Bülent Ceylan Show,The Simpsons
Die Bülent Ceylan Show,Doctor Who is the most obvious one. They should just create a series finale to conclude the story.
Die Bülent Ceylan Show,The Walking Dead. Quite ironic isn't it lol
Die Bülent Ceylan Show,"WHAT

How is that show still running? I would have absolutely sworn it ended years ago."
Die Bülent Ceylan Show,And the people falling over don’t even win at the end of the episode. Instead it’s always a cute kid mispronouncing words or a pet chasing their own tail. All that injury for nothing.
Die Bülent Ceylan Show,"My theory is that no one actually watches Grey's Anatomy anymore but people just leave it on in the background out of habit while they're reading or doing house chores so the ratings are still there and the show keeps getting renewed.

It's been years since I've heard someone say ""I like Grey's Anatomy"""
Die Bülent Ceylan Show,"ER went through ups and downs, making it worth revisiting when you hadn’t watched it for awhile. They would introduce new characters and lose older ones which “refreshed” the show. Is Greys the same way, or is it just consistently bad after a certain point?"
Die Bülent Ceylan Show,[removed]
Die Bülent Ceylan Show,"That seems to be a trend now, adult animation seems to be able to last as long as the creators want them to. Maybe it's easier to produce than live action? Especially since it's not hand-drawn anymore. Once great animated shows seem to be destined to never end and become zombified versions of themselves like The Simpsons. I loved Archer until about a decade ago and I just kind of forgot it was still on."
Die Bülent Ceylan Show,"I used to love Archer, then stopped watching it. I recently tried downloading the new season and absolutely hated it. Turned it off after 10 minutes because all of the characters were grating me."
Die Bülent Ceylan Show,"> The Walking Dead. I feel like they announced the show had one more season left like 5 years ago yet there are still more episodes left to air.

It was 2 years ago! I feel shows are announcing they're ending earlier and earlier nowadays.

Better Call Saul took like 3 years to end after they announced it was wrapping with 6 seasons."
Die Bülent Ceylan Show,"I remember I decided to wait until it ends, so I could watch from the start to end. It’s been… 8 years ago."
Die Bülent Ceylan Show,I think it's largely the fact that AMC always has very few popular shows at any one time and they know TWD at its peak was a monster and they're still larping as though everyone still cares like it's 2010 and that the finale/movies/spin-offs are super hype or something.
Die Bülent Ceylan Show,The way they've broken up this final season seems like it's been going on forever.
Die Bülent Ceylan Show,"I still watch it, just not live. I'll DVR all the episodes and then once a month or so, run through 3-4 episodes when I have to work late and just want something on in the background.

It is ending this season though."
Die Bülent Ceylan Show,"The breaks they had to take due to COVID really helped me realise I was only watching out of habit. When I had to google if it was on one week or back the next, I realised it wasn't even worth that effort any more."
Die Bülent Ceylan Show,Shock horror! There's a big world outside of your group of friends.
Die Bülent Ceylan Show,It could be a fun show if he’d hire a different host.
Die Bülent Ceylan Show,And notoriously antiBlack and misogynistic
Die Bülent Ceylan Show,Had no idea Survivor was still going on.  It seems like such a time capsule of early 2000s to me.
Die Bülent Ceylan Show,"American Idol ironically has had small success recently with more contestants succeeding in radio and touring, while in its heyday it was almost impossible to break out."
Die Bülent Ceylan Show,I thought that they cancelled American Idol before Covid.
Die Bülent Ceylan Show,theres a new one
Die Bülent Ceylan Show,My whole region of my state didn't even have a Fox affiliate when the Simpsons started airing.
Die Bülent Ceylan Show,"I haven't watched the show in ages. I assume Bart should be onto his fifth or sixth elephant by now, right?"
Die Bülent Ceylan Show,"I'm still enjoying BB, but I only discovered it within the last year."
Die Bülent Ceylan Show,"Na, this is the show that can go on forever. If the ''reboots'' with a new cast, new writers etc. are good is another question. 

I didn't finish the latest season but I'll for sure try it out again once RTD and Ncuti take over."
Die Bülent Ceylan Show,"But it is dead.  There are no new movies being made, it's done."
Die Bülent Ceylan Show,"Nah. Doctor Who can literally go on forever. 

The entire premise of the show is new characters that change every few years, go on adventures that are completely different from one another every episode. 

It’s the type of show that doesn’t need an ending. Just get new and capable writers in every few years."
Die Bülent Ceylan Show,"It's not that kind of show.  The conclusion, satisfying or otherwise, is when the Doctor transitions to a new body.  There's not some grand overarching story that needs to be wrapped up.  It's a vessel for sci fi stories that will keep adapting to modern audiences."
Die Bülent Ceylan Show,"Agreed. Just let it rest for a few years then reboot it. I think a good jumping off point for the reboot would be to hire David Morissey as the new doctor. Have it turn out he really was the timelord after all. Or, re-hire Paul McGann and start there."
Die Bülent Ceylan Show,The Walking Dead will end this year.
Die Bülent Ceylan Show,"Yeh. The premise was good to start with, but no idea how they strung that out for like 8 or 9 seasons."
Die Bülent Ceylan Show,Wait till you find out that >!Red is Elizabeth's mother!<
Die Bülent Ceylan Show,"IMO, GA has never introduced a new character that made the show feel “fresh” once they started bleeding original cast members. Additions like Addison Montgomery and Cali Torres were great, but their storylines were rooted in that of the original cast. I can’t even count all the annoying characters they’ve added over the years. I find it shocking that that show is still on in many ways."
Die Bülent Ceylan Show,I agree about ER.
Die Bülent Ceylan Show,I dunno about that “as long as the creators want to” hypothesis. Seth McFarlane has gone on record saying he thinks Family Guy should have ended years ago.
Die Bülent Ceylan Show,"Animation must be a great gig for the actors, and as you say, since it isn't hand-drawn, maybe the animation isn't so hard.  Perhaps they build up a library or patterns for everything.  

Wouldn't it be nice if they turned over these legacy shows to young writers with an affinity for the early seasons of a show.  Archer and The Simpsons were once great shows.  Give them new life or let them die with dignity."
Die Bülent Ceylan Show,I actually didn’t think it was actively bad (unlike modern FG or Simpsons episodes). Just kinda coasting.
Die Bülent Ceylan Show,"Yeah, I gave up on Archer a while ago. I thought they were building a big connected world of recurring gags and characters arcs, like Arrested Development but with spies. Turns out no, exact opposite, it's just random bullshit."
Die Bülent Ceylan Show,I’m tempted to go back and watch the whole thing.   I stopped at about season 6.  First season is so good
Die Bülent Ceylan Show,"Crazy how stuff like that works, I remember after breaking it and trying to catch up on it like 10 minutes into an episode I just realized I have no idea why I am watching it and just shut it off and never went back to it again. The Arrowverse at one point had so much steam and then it all kind of came to a sudden end."
Die Bülent Ceylan Show,Agreed I used to watch all the CW DC shows. After the COVID break I realized how much of a chore it really was and I completely stopped all of them.
Die Bülent Ceylan Show,"Maybe. I tried watching it years ago and he was certainly the worst part of it, so you could be right."
Die Bülent Ceylan Show,"I know, right? You had me doubting myself. Just looked it up. Season 43. Haha"
Die Bülent Ceylan Show,I only know this because there's some people who write it up at /r/hobbydrama. Which is a pretty amazing place to briefly learn about the nonsense in something you otherwise don't give a shit about.
Die Bülent Ceylan Show,I remember a friend telling me he felt like it was running out of ideas... around 2004 or so
Die Bülent Ceylan Show,I'm surprised the radio is still a thing.
Die Bülent Ceylan Show,They have a 6 movie plan. It’s not over until they say it’s over.
Die Bülent Ceylan Show,"At least from what I heard they killed off Elizabeth Keene. The show should have been about Red from the start, and not the stupid is she his daughter shit"
Die Bülent Ceylan Show,"I believe Addison is back in the upcoming season, possibly to fill the void with Meredith only being in about half of the episodes."
Die Bülent Ceylan Show,I'm sure he likes the paycheck.
Die Bülent Ceylan Show,">Wouldn't it be nice if they turned over these legacy shows to young writers with an affinity for the early seasons of a show. 

I assume they do this. One current Simpsons writer was born well after the series began."
Die Bülent Ceylan Show,American Dad has surprisingly kept its charm over the years. Moving to TBS might've been a shot in the arm for them.
Die Bülent Ceylan Show,I've heard the show has a great bounce back in season 9 when it changed showrunners again.
Die Bülent Ceylan Show,It never comes close to season 1 levels again. I always wonder what it would have become if Frank Darabont wasn't fired.
Die Bülent Ceylan Show,"I checked recently and read there is nothing in development for a fourth movie, let alone fifth or sixth movies.

Plans don't mean anything without the money to execute them."
Die Bülent Ceylan Show,"I know… but where she was brought in as Derek’s wife and then got her own stories too, now she’s… there because the show is in trouble and they needed a veteran. 

That’s really the entire problem with Grey’s Anatomy after say… 6 seasons, but maybe less? The stories aren’t organic anymore."
Die Bülent Ceylan Show,"> I've heard the show has a great bounce back in season 9 when it changed showrunners again.

I hear this like every year with the show..."
Die Bülent Ceylan Show,"Oh absolutely, I totally agree. The show has been spinning its wheels for over a decade now. You just know that Ellen Pompeo just wants it to end but the ratings are still pretty good and ABC is paying her a fortune so on it goes."
Die Bülent Ceylan Show,"At what point do you decide you’ve made enough money, and then switch to doing something that makes you happy?

It’s not like ABC couldn’t bring in a cousin or brother or sister character with the last name “Grey” to take over the show."
Die Bülent Ceylan Show,They don't need that. The hospital is basically named after her.
Die Bülent Ceylan Show,Andy Whitfield from Spartacus. He was fantastic and such a big loss. The prequel season was great but I had a hard time adjusting to the later seasons without him.
Die Bülent Ceylan Show,[deleted]
Die Bülent Ceylan Show,Silicon Valley. Christopher Evan Welch died while S1 was being filmed. He wasn't written off until the S2 premiere.
Die Bülent Ceylan Show,Luke Perry from Riverdale
Die Bülent Ceylan Show,"Cheers. The actor for coach died between season 3 & 4. I always liked the way they handled it,  he was an old man who passed and the characters all talk fondly of the friend they lost. They don't make a big deal of it,  but whenever he gets mentioned it's nice. Felt very real."
What She Put on the Table,"- I Love Lucy. Iconic comedy that popularized the multi-camera approach with a live studio audience and the approach to syndication. 

- All in the Family. Incorporated discussion of current events, becoming a cultural touchstone during a time of substantial social change. 

- Seinfeld. Perfected the approach of separate disconnected plots, each individually funny, coming together for a larger punchline at the end. 

- The Simpsons. A massive stack of instantly recognizable plots and characters and gags that spans literal generations.  

Just off the list: Cheers, Cosby Show (due to the... unpleasantness), Arrested Development. 

As my personal Mount Rushmore: Parks and Rec, Simpsons, Police Squad, Scrubs."

Sudden,I love this song but it makes me depressed at the same time.
Sudden,That final table conversation was the best way to end this show. Carrie Coon is phenomenal and because of this show I now am a fan of Justin Theroux
Sudden,This fucking show broke me.  My brother got me hooked on it a few years ago.  It’s 3 seasons of the most relentlessly depressing and disturbing storyline ever invented and all of the acting is superb.
Sudden,"Favorite show of all time. 

“You come to my house”"
Sudden,"This show stuck with me, maybe more than any other show I've watched. 

If you're on the fence, do it. It'll challenge you and make you think like few other shows have. It makes so many brave choices."
Sudden,What a great fucking show.
Sudden,"There are so many beautiful moments from the show. 
I really love this song that the high school girl sings about Jarden town in season two. 

https://youtu.be/LYmHK9GMPMs"
Sudden,this show had those sweat suit people smoking cigarettes didn't it?
Sudden,"I always thought there was a lot of wasted potential in ""the snap"" from Avengers. But apparently there is an entire show built around that idea. And it came first."
Sudden,"Oh man, this is a series. I would totally watch it right now if it was a movie.

  


  
Is the series worth it?"
Sudden,"I loved this show; one of my favorite things I've watched in the past 20 years. If you've never seen it but are intrigued, fair warning: you will see people who critique the show or didn't care for it because they ""don't give a satisfying answer as to the mystery/what really happened.""

I'd say that that is technically true on its face, and obviously it's fine for a show to not be up your alley if it doesn't tick exactly the boxes you're hoping for like that. It certainly isn't gonna be for everyone. But the show knows what it is and is pretty deliberate about its intention to not be about the answer to the mystery, and more just about what it would be like to live in this world where people were suddenly raptured and never really actually have the answer. 

If you go into it understanding that you're just along for the ride and not building to some sort of ""LOST - what really is the deal with the island?"" type of plotline then it's an amazing and beautifully crafted story (albeit one that can be very emotionally draining and at times depressing).

One other thought. I understand that it was adapted from a book (or book series) and so they took the ""2% of the population disappeared"" figure directly from that source material. The one change I would've made is I'd have upped that number only because it seemed low. 

Don't get me wrong, any sort of ""unexplained disappearance"" would definitely have a mindfuck effect for the world at large, even if it was just 2% or ~150 million people globally. But the show sometimes makes it feel as though almost everyone in the world personally knows DOZENS of people who departed when the math for that just doesn't add up. If it was randomly distributed, we're talking about only what, 2 out of every 100 people you know departing? That means your family and social circles are still gonna be pretty intact. 

I felt like the number of departed should have increased to something like 12-15% of the world population, because then it would seem much more likely that almost everyone in the world would've lost at least one or two close friends/family members (if not more). But that's just my take, curious what others think."
Sudden,"Oh I’m going to rewatch this, I forgot how good it was"
Sudden,Could someone spoil for me as to what caused the disappearance?
Sudden,I was left with such a void after watching this show. The only show that gave me the same feels was Dark.
Sudden,Best television show of all time.
Sudden,"Simply put, The Leftovers is one of the most fascinating and moving shows I've ever seen. Max Richter's score will have me crying in a matter of seconds."
Sudden,"I remembered trying to watch this show back when it came out in 2014 and not liking it after watching the first few episodes  Once I found out the writers said we would never find out the reason for the departure, I immediately dropped it. I revisited it a few weeks ago and just finished the series last week. I now think it's one of the best shows ever made. I feel like it's one of those shows you have to have a certain mindset for. You have to be willing to accept the ambiguity and senseless bc that's the exact ideas the show is trying to portray."
Sudden,Trying to think of a recent-ish show that approaches the level of quality of The Leftovers.  Coming up empty.  This show was simply on another level.
Sudden,Best show I’ve ever seen.
Sudden,Holy crap! That’s Rava!
Sudden,One of my favorite shows of all time. The music is wonderful and sad.
Sudden,"I love Carrie Coon so much in everything, even when she's in bad movies or shows she ALWAYs brings 100%"
Sudden,"“International Assassin”   

That is all I got."
Sudden,Favorite Show of all time. Devastatingly perfect.
Sudden,"If you watch this show and think it’s too frustrating/confusing keep going, at least until end of season 2. That finale is my favorite episode of TV ever made"
Sudden,"Such an underrated series, honestly one my favorites of all times."
Sudden,The leftovers: snack for later.
Sudden,"The soundtrack to this show is absolutely amazing, One of the best in the past 10 years."
Sudden,This series moved me in so many ways. It's mentally exhausting to watch. A masterpiece for sure.
Sudden,"One of the best shows of all time. Thank you for reminding me of this, OP."
Sudden,This series is fascinating 💔
Sudden,"I could never get into this show because I could never accept the premise. The show goes out of it's way to explicitly say that there's no explanation and that it's totally random, and that all the scientists in the world looking for patterns or reasons couldn't find any... and that's fine for a TV show but it just pisses me off so much because that's not how our real world, reality, works.  I get it, suspension of disbelief, but I really really dislike that idea and just can't overcome it."
Sudden,"I might be in the minority here, but while they were many fantastic elements to the show, enough to get me to watch it all the way through, there’s a lot of writing choices where they just forcibly made the relationships worse unnecessarily. When bad communication is a consistent, major plot device, I get extremely irritated, and that was the case in the show. Thank god it had so much intrigue and good acting."
Sudden,"Favorite show ever made. 

An aside: never realized it was Kendall Roy’s ex wife here lol."
Sudden,[deleted]
Sudden,I thought all the moms were the same person until the end
Sudden,I don't even know if the ending or beginning were more tragic😭🥺 It was such a build up for her. The one who lost everything. I always think of this show when people say everyone has suffered during the pandemic or in life in general. Some have suffered a lot worse. She got hit crazy hard☹️
Sudden,"Warning,  if you want to watch this. There is and will never be reason why. No closure."
Sudden,"But the snap was explained to people.  Sure, it was 50-50 random but the leftovers thing just happened for no rhyme or reason, people just blinked out of existence."
Sudden,"The worst show peer pressure made me watch. 
I was hoping I would never be reminded of this groundbreaking show that kicked into gear the no hope and all depressing TV drama. Truly terrible entertainment in all sense of the word."
Sudden,I can't believe I slept on this show for so long. Went straight to my top 5 favorites. It battles Better Call Saul for #2. #1 goes to The Wire because I'm that guy.
Sudden,Ahhh shit you’re going to make me rewatch this entire series aren’t you
Sudden,One of the best shows I ever watched and easily one of the best opening scenes
Sudden,So glad you shared this. Reminded me how much I loved this scene...
Sudden,I think it’s the perfect show to watch between Infinity War and Endgame.
Sudden,Every time television or film shows a parent struggling it's because the parent has no clue what they're doing. Always hard to believe
Sudden,Great show. Overwhelming to think of people vanishing right before your eyes.
Sudden,"*We fucked up with Nora*

There's your theme; grief, self-honesty, catharsis.."
Sudden,"This, Rectify, and halt and catch fire are my 3 favourite shows of all time"
Sudden,It's been years since I've watched this show but even this 4 min clip has me choking back tears. Masterful writing. The music grips me.
Sudden,"This show is like if Dear Zachary was a fictional melodrama that you had to watch *every week*. 

I haven’t seen that sequence in years and just teared up knowing what happens. 

They were smart to turn into the crazy batshit skid and keep making the show wilder every season. 

So many moments in the series were like having Mike Tyson punch you in the gut. Repeatedly."
Sudden,"The Max Ritcher experience.

The lindelof shows have had some of my favourite uses of music tbh."
Sudden,I can’t listen to On The Nature of Daylight. 20 seconds in and I’m on the verge of tears. It’s wild.
Sudden,The [intro](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRyirVgs1yc) to season 2 and 3 is also really depressing if you watch it.
Sudden,The song sends me into deep self reflecting thought whenever I hear it
Sudden,"The whole series is super depressing. Its a show that will not put you in a good mood as there are not really ""high"" moments. Also a really really bad show to watch if your are not in a good headspace. But holy fuck is it amazing"
Sudden,When this music hits in the show prepare for some feels. This is my all time favorite series.
Sudden,The music on this show is so damn good
Sudden,"Re: Agents of SHIELD flair

Good stuff and great taste!"
Sudden,Its probably all the screaming?
Sudden,"I dunno how Justin hasn't been getting way more work after this show. He was really great. All the way through.

Carrie Coon has been getting a bit more high profile work but she feels underappreciated too. Both should have got Emmy's."
Sudden,"Justin Theroux... during the scene in the penultimate episode of Season 1 where he is reading a Bible verse over \[redacted\]'s grave, slowly breaking down into tears, cemented him as an all-time great actor, for me. I broke the fuck down with him and ended that episode *sobbing* for fuck's sake."
Sudden,"> relentlessly depressing

I thought the hotel was pretty funny."
Sudden,Prolonged bouts of depression with bursts of catharsis... it's great.
Sudden,"I wouldn't call it 'relentlessly depressing'. Very sad, yes, and it's more or less *Depression, mourning, suicidal ideation: the TV show*...but it does, er, relent. Each season ends on a moment of catharsis and forgiveness and reconciliation."
Sudden,I loved it too. I thought it was heartbreaking that Kevin would use up all his vacation time for years just searching for Nora
Sudden,"The moment that broke me fully was S01E05 Gladys. I won’t spoil it openly but watching Gladys’ story across that episode and the way it ended demolished me. Full uncontrollable sobbing.

The show did that to me at the end as well as I realized what I was listening to after Nora tells her story about finding her family on the other side of the machine. 

I don’t think a show will ever hit me like this one again."
Sudden,"Oh definitely, hands down the best tv series I don't know I could ever watch again."
Sudden,"I watched the whole thing again a few weeks ago. It’s such a good show, but there is *so much* crying."
Sudden,"That first season is just such amazingly bleak and nihilistic, but still so wonderful. It was exactly what I needed at exactly the right time."
Sudden,I wanted to watch it but I have such a problem with loss. It just made me so sad and helpless. I was also deeply depressed when it released. Maybe now it would be better.
Sudden,Theroux and Coon are just amazing.
Sudden,That’s the line that took the show from great to an all time favorite
Sudden,“That’s the man I was telling you about.”
Sudden,"Same. I don’t exactly know what it is about it, but it has this magic for me. Every component is well done"
Sudden,I was emotionally exhausted after Season two I had to take a three year break
Sudden,"This show and Halt and Catch Fire are the two that really made a huge impact on me- much more than any other shows. Most shows are just popcorn entertainment to me, but those two changed the way I see the world."
Sudden,Then when you find out how they really felt.... The twist at the end of the season was amazing
Sudden,Yeah but it's so much more than that.
Sudden,I’m not positive but didn’t “the snap” happen in the marvel comics way before the leftovers was a show?
Sudden,"It’s probably one of my favorite shows of all time, but It’s pretty *out there.* Carrie Coon gives one of the greatest tv performances I’ve ever seen, and the writing is just incredible.

I would say that if you’re a fan of Lost, (it’s by the same creator, though it’s much more cohesive as a series) or any kind of mystery TV show, you should totally give it a shot."
Sudden,Season 2 and 3 are two of the greatest seasons of television to exist.
Sudden,"just an FYI its about how we would deal with something that makes no fucking sense.

. What actually happened I think is explained at the end but it doesn't matter cause it was weird fun ride"
Sudden,you’re in a tv sub Reddit of course it’s a show 🤦🏻‍♂️
Sudden,IMO it is one of the greatest tv dramas of all time. It isn't for everyone though.
Sudden,Yes. One of the best series of all time if you ask me.
Sudden,"It’s an excellent show, takes a while to build BUT my suggestion - do NOT binge.  This show is best taken with some space between it.  I regret that I watched it all at once over a week or so rather than letting it breath a little."
Sudden,"If I were to make a prestige TV Mount Rushmore, this show would be on it.  Maybe even in the top spot."
Sudden,Greatest show of all time. Yes.
Sudden,"I watched because everyone hypes it so much and absolutely hated it. I say it isn't, but just watch a few episodes and decide for yourself"
Sudden,"No, not worth it"
Sudden,"Season 1 is the weakest imo.

I had issues progressing through Season 1 and constantly wondered what the show is supposed to ultimately be about

Season 2 & 3 are great

also, Season 1 is an adaptation of a book, but I believe there were no further books to adapt, so Season 2 & 3 were what the show writers came up themselves."
Sudden,"I couldn’t get past episode 2. The way everyone was acting just made no sense to me, even given the circumstances."
Sudden,"No. It's a terrible show with a premise that overstays its welcome after the first season, and has no satisfactory conclusion. Unfortunately, the showrunner, who is famous for unsatisfactory conclusions, got the world to believe that it was intentional this time, and if you disagree then ""you just don't get it."""
Sudden,It’s easily one of my favourite shows.
Sudden,"Soooooo fucking worth it.  It should be on every top ten (or twenty) list of television series. 
It’s not for everyone but goddamn if it isn’t near perfect, unique and impactful."
Sudden,">  If you've never seen it but are intrigued, fair warning: you will see people who critique the show or didn't care for it because they ""don't give a satisfying answer as to the mystery/what really happened.""

I always found this to be a really weird take from people. The Leftovers, at least for me, had the most perfectly satisfying ending of any series I've ever seen. Any other show would have either tried to explain too much or nothing at all, neither of which would have worked (the former because it would be totally at odds with the entire theme of the show, the latter because it would be wholly unsatisfying). Instead, they answer the ""what"" but not the ""why"" and it's feels like the sweet spot in trying to find meaning in something mysterious and incomprehensible."
Sudden,"Cause isn't clearly outlined. 

Some theories such as ""split dimension"" but it has zero bearing upon the show. 

The show is very much about dealing with the trauma of a global experience so far removed from normal that no one can process appropriately. It's amazing."
Sudden,I'll just say that the cause is never really explained. You are provided with an explanation as to what happened to the other people. It's up to you if you want to believe that explaination or not.
Sudden,"Let the mystery be.

PS I’m not being sarcastic, that’s kind of the point of the show in a way. It’s not about what caused it, it’s about how the people react to not knowing what happened."
blood blockade battlefront,"I don't suppose you could add a brief few sentences/words selling us on the series and why they're worth a watch and what makes them special? To me, I just see a laundry list of titles and genres honestly. 

Knowing the animation studio and year released is pretty much meaningless for knowing the quality of character development and plot depth."

blood blockade battlefront,My Hero Academia is also really excellent.

blood blockade battlefront,"Next time I would include Animes that would appeal to Western Taste. Most of these will not be appealing for the general audience. 

Some good animes for the Western Taste (2010s only):

One-Punch Man (Action/Comedy. An overpowered dude that is a hero for fun).


My Hero Academica (Action/Coming of Age story. A weak powerless boy gets the most powerful superpower in the world and his tale to master this power without breaking everything in his body using it.)


Psycho Pass (Thriller/Crime. Dystopian Future where police kills everyone who has a hint of mental instability)

Parasyte (Thriller/Horror. Dude gets infected by an alien parasite but the infection doesn't go as planned.)

Edit: Forgot to add that these all have English Dubs. Most of the list above do not.
"
blood blockade battlefront,"Gundam: Iron Blooded Orphans
Is a great one, its serious, the animation looks great, it does get dark because it deals with children piloting the mechs"
blood blockade battlefront,"First, thank you putting this list together and trying to offer more exposure to an entire medium/format/genre (Japanese animation) that is, imo, underappreciated in the west. Now, on to a few thoughts/opinions:

When people actually ask for recommendations, it's best not to overwhelm them with options else they might feel overwhelmed and give up. If they get a response of ""Evangelion, Cowboy Bebop, Samurai Champloo, Death Note"" then they already have ~100 hours of watching ahead of them and those are totally fine options. 

There's a lot of comedy and slice of life on this list. While more variety sounds better on paper, I don't think those genres work as well as others with a language/culture barrier. They're usually more character focused and thus body language, dialog, inflection, dialect, translation, nuance, delivery, inside jokes, locality, animation style, etc. become more important. The usual Cowboy Bebop recommendations are generally more serious, conceptual, sci-fi, psychological, seinen, action, mystery -type series that show off what ""adult"" animation is capable of which result in more ""wow!"" experiences (and western media ""borrowing"" from them). The unfortunate ""anime stigma"" in the west is that anime is perverted and characters look/act like 12yo children (which westerners already have in the form of youth-targeted cartoons). So, while I personally really enjoy something like Kill La Kill, I don't think the over-the-top action, ridiculous plot, and easily misinterpreted sexualization would be a good starting point/leave a good first impression for the uninitiated. 

This list is great for those who have already watched most of the popular recommendations for westerners and want to branch out a bit more. That said, new fans should keep in mind that they'll probably dislike 95% of all anime produced. I've watched 300+ series and I wouldn't go anywhere near some of the stuff on this list. And that's OK; it's common with most hobbies/interests. Find what you like, look for more, have fun with it, share your experiences!

For reference, my favorite TV (top 10, random order):

* Breaking Bad/Better Call Saul

blood blockade battlefront,"I was kinda hoping you would list [Uchuu Kyoudai](https://myanimelist.net/anime/12431/Uchuu_Kyoudai ) or Space Brothers in English.  Pretty good slice of life/sci fi about becoming an Astronaut.   Here is the [trailer with English sub for it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciS3fDqT1Vw )

Another series maybe not considered in the past decade is [Hajime No Ippo](https://myanimelist.net/anime/263/Hajime_no_Ippo ) even though the 3rd season (Hajime No Ippo: Rising) came out in 2013/2014.  Its a great sport/slice of life/comedy series."

basically anime that does not rely on anime troupes and tells a great story, what would you recommend from this decade?

edit: action oriented is a plus"
blood blockade battlefront,I'd like to throw a shout for Terror in Resonance too. Great show
blood blockade battlefront,"Barakamon and Girls' Last Tour are two of my absolute favorite shows, and I'm pretty happy to see them make the list. Sora no Woto is up there too.

Those three are all slice-of-life type shows, a genre that can be pretty hit or miss, but these three do a great job of building a world (or a town, as in Barakamon) and making you keep watching because you're interested in that world, and the characters, even if there's no overreaching plot trying to tie everything together. They aren't necessarily exciting, but they're thoroughly enjoyable. And sometimes you just need a nice calm show like that."
blood blockade battlefront,Kind of a weird post. I'd expect at least a sorry description with each show. A genre doesn't really cut it.
blood blockade battlefront,"**Sora no Woto** is surprisingly good. Definitely not what I expected. It's part slice of life, part post-apocalypse, and also an anti-war story. And the music is fantastic. Occasionally feels like **Kino's Journey**, but somwhat less bleak. 

***
**Showa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu** is a slow burn, but is an exceptionally good period drama set in the post-postwar era where the Japanese economy was beginning to pick up again. One of the popular forms of entertainment was a style of traditonal comic storytelling called Rakugo. In an era where not many had televisions yet, they were often broadcast on radio. 

A recently released convict approaches one of the masters of this artform to become his disciple after having only heard his radio broadcasts in prison. Drama ensues. Lots of dialogue as you may expect. **Joshiraku** is a much less serious take on Rakugo, if you like terrible puns and Japanese cultural references you won't understand, this is for you. 

***
**Natsume's Book of Friends** is really one of the most heartbreaking yet heartwarming series I've ever seen. Main character is the only person who can see the denizens of the spirit world, resulting in him being ostracised by almost every human he meets due to his reaction to heir presence, but returning to his grandmother's hometown changes that, for better or worse. Partly episodic, but with some overarching plot. For another contemporary fantasy series that's kind of similar, try **The Ancient Magus' Bride**. **Mushishi** is also excellent and has a similar spirit detective vibe, but much more serious. "

Do you recommend it? Based on my viewing history and the Netflix catalogue what would you recommend I watch next?"

blood blockade battlefront,"I'm someone who haven't watched a lot of anime since about 2008 or so, so I'll check out some of these, thanks. 

That said, I feel like the medium has definitely changed a lot since that time. So many shows now have either very strange animation styles (Kill la Kill, Made in Abyss, Devilman Crybaby...) or these strange formulaic stock characters everywhere (at least I don't remember people talking about tsunderes and moes and I don't know what back in the day). I'm sure there's a lot of good stuff once you get past these things, but in most cases nowadays I don't get further than some weirdass synopsis before I sigh and re-watch Black Lagoon or Claymore instead. And I'm someone who, despite not immersing myself into the anime/""weabo"" culture, has after all read and watched quite a lot of manga and anime in my time, and someone who likes 'weird' stuff Evangelion or Gantz.

I think that's the reason why Attack on Titan has been such a hit here in the West, despite imho not being that good of a show (it seems to go for repeated 'shocks' over telling an engaging story). It has a pretty 'realistic' and good looking animation style, characters that for the most part look rather normal, and though the premise is a bit strange it's very straight-forward once it gets going."
blood blockade battlefront,"Recently saw Made in Abyss because a lot of people have been raving about it.

The main characters are a girl of 14, and a robot that looks like a boy of about the same age.

I would like it a lot more, if there were not shit like recurring ""jokes"" where people look down the robot boys pants and exclaim that he has a penis. 

Like often when people were recommending it, I'd see em specify that it was not for children, and I kinda assumed that was because of horror elements or something. Like god dammit Japan."
blood blockade battlefront,"Ummm...My Hero Academia?

It's an amazing shonen series with much better pacing, animation and characters than a lot of its contemporaries."
blood blockade battlefront,"Another one I’d absolutely recommend if you’re looking for a more light hearted/comedic take on anime is “The Devil is a Part Timer”. 

Really funny, great story and quick watch. Premise is pretty simple, Devil comes back to earth and tries to take over the world...by working in fast food. 

If I’m not mistaken it’s still on Netflix, highly highly recommend."
blood blockade battlefront,Parastye -the maxim- should 100% be on this list. 
blood blockade battlefront,"I'm gonna use this thread to mention that, yes, One Piece has over 800 episodes, but it is probably the most pure fun that you can find while still managing to be epic, emotional and engaging. "
blood blockade battlefront,"Your lie in april. 

Shokugeki no soma 

Nanatsu no taizai"
blood blockade battlefront,I'll martyr myself and list Tokyo Ghoul. I guess it's become pretty 'normie' but i still really enjoyed it. Also The Lost Village was a pretty neat short one.
blood blockade battlefront,I recognized so few animes in that list. Feel like you're missing a TON.
blood blockade battlefront,"Damn. When you realize all of the super popular anime you liked as a kid aren’t part of this decade lol 

Old. "
blood blockade battlefront,Does crunchyroll or funimation offer offline/download & play yet? That's been my biggest obstacle to consuming anime.
blood blockade battlefront,Black Clover?
blood blockade battlefront,.
blood blockade battlefront,I would recommend Made in Abyss. Only one season and it's already one of my favorites.
blood blockade battlefront,Beast Player Erin (Kemono no Sōja) is a really good one that I never hear anyone mention.
blood blockade battlefront,"Pretty good list, though I'd add Higurashi (the official stuff, essentially seasons 1 and 2.) for how damn good it was it combining the slice of life with horror, especially the more psychological aspects. Umineko is different, but good just somewhat odd at times and feels better to read than merely watch. 
"
blood blockade battlefront,"Baki 2018. Absolutely brutal fighting. If you are squeamish do not watch. It is metal as hell though, I love it.


I could probably recommend some others but I'll leave it at that."
blood blockade battlefront,[deleted]
blood blockade battlefront,"Don't forget to request to get new seasons of your favorite anime:

https://help.netflix.com/en/titlerequest"
blood blockade battlefront,"I've only ever watched one anime in my adult life and that's Attack on Titan. I really enjoyed it but I'm fine not watching anything else. I have some personal hang ups about anime being ""for kids"", even the one tailored for mature audiences. "
blood blockade battlefront,"Not only are these shows that fall out of the ""Same 10 anime"" thing. They're all shows that I can see actually getting people into anime. Shows like FMA:B and Death Note are shows that feel detached enough for people to think ""I'm not too sure about anime, but Fullmetal Alchemist is pretty good"" instead of ""hey maybe I like anime"". All of these shows (at least the ones I've seen) are both great and feel like anime. Good list.


I also want to boost March Comes in Like a Lion to anyone reading this. It's one of my favorite shows. It follows a 17 year old depressed professional Shogi player who just recently started living on his own. Over the course of the series you watch him open up to people and form a familiar relationship that he's never really had in his life. You don't need to know anything about Shogi to understand the show."
blood blockade battlefront,"I'd like to think that Shouwa Genjou Rakugo Shinju is the pinnacle of anime in recent years. THE series that towers above the rest. It's not my favourite series for sure, but it comes incredibly close to perfection in so many ways. I doubt I'd recommend it to someone new to anime, but there's no excuse for anyone who calls themselves an avid fan of anime to not watch Rakugo. 

And then there's Ping Pong... The things I would give to see another series of this caliber. I'm so glad to see it on your list."
blood blockade battlefront,All are pretty good except Yuru Camp and Flip Flappers
blood blockade battlefront,"Kobayashi's Dragon Maid is probably the first new-ish anime I've fully watched in years, since Bodacious Space Pirates and Jormungand. It's poignant, cute, a little... creepy... but still heartily recommended."
blood blockade battlefront,"I was never an Anime fan.  I remember enjoying Ninja Scroll back in the 90's, but that's about it.  Then one day 'Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress' popped up on Amazon Prime, and I clicked on it, because there was nothing else to watch.  Loved it.  As soon as I finished it, I wanted to see even more.  Attack on Titan was a recommendation I've heard over and over, so I started watching it next.  It was even better than the Iron Fortress.  The animation, the soundtrack, the story - they were all just perfect, and I couldn't wait for more.

While waiting for the next season, I was eager to see all the other great anime shows I've been missing out on.  But here's where the disappointment came.  I would check dozens of the top recommended shows, and they simply weren't my cup of tea.  Either the animation was looking like something made in the 80's, or the story was just meh.  I could barely watch one episode, before giving up in the search of the next Attack on Titan. 

It all made sense, when I found out both Attack on Titan, and Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress are made by the same studio.  I have yet to find any other anime show that comes close to those two.  And this is not me shitting on other shows.  I'm sure they're great, but they just don't do it for me.  There's just something about AoT or KotIF, whether it's the awesome visuals, or soundtrack, that put them in a league of their own."
blood blockade battlefront,"No sword art online season 1?

What's the point?


Jk (though I do like SAO)

Great list op thanks for sharing"
blood blockade battlefront,"Maybe doesn't *technically* count, but 48% of Gintama (and potentially more, maybe, hopefully) has come after your cutoff date, and imo Gintama is a legendary anime. Action/comedy, has survived multiple hiatuses, and has reportedly been more profitable than Bleach or Naruto in Western countries, made even more incredible due to its lack of an English dub or mainstream viewing channel (such as Cartoon Network's Toonami). Insane amounts of fun, and I'm incredibly sad to be seeing it go."
blood blockade battlefront,[deleted]
blood blockade battlefront,"Totally expected, but still dissapointed that there's no Yu-Gi-Oh. :p  
Just fits well with my personal taste.  
  
My favorite beyond that though is the old anime Ranma ½. Although the manga has better plots and characterization, love the animation, voices and music. :D"
blood blockade battlefront,"Look at you making a worthless list that doesn't include whether there is a dub, which makes it awful, and by extension you awful."
blood blockade battlefront,"Oh! I can do a brief rundown of all of them. Give me a few minutes and I'll be back with a few words about each.  


EDIT: OKAY! Here we go.

**Barakamon:** brash young calligrapher gets exiled to the boonies to find himself

**Blood Blockade Battlefront:** secret society of supers fight weird monsters in wacky New York

**Cells at Work:** Osmosis Jones but with a cute redhead as the lead instead of Chris Rock

**Chihayafuru:** Sports show about a poetry card game. Cooler than it sounds.

**Death Parade:** Bar in purgatory hosts games to judge souls’ fates

**The Eccentric Family:** An eccentric family of shapeshifters go about their lives

**Erased:** Time travel murder mystery where the time travel isn’t that big of a deal. Tearjerker.

**Flip Flappers:** I literally cannot describe it beyond “two magical girls and trippy world”

**Flying Witch:** Extremely relaxing show about a witch training in the countryside

**Girls’ Last Tour:** Two girls journey across a harsh post apocalyptic wasteland. Philosophy?

**Haikyuu:** Hot guys play volleyball. Character development.

**Hyouka:** Bored high schoolers solve boring mysteries. Show is anything but boring.

**K-On:** Cute high school girls play in a band and eat cake. Super comfy.

**Katanagatari:** Finding swords? Weird art style. Weirder dialogue.

**Kids on the Slope:** Realistic jazz coming of age in the 60s. Great music.

**Kill la Kill:** Skimpy lingerie battles at fascist high school. Way better than it sounds.

**Kyousogiga:** Similarly trippy, often confusing show about multidimensional family. Fantastic.

**Land of the Lustrous:** One of the few 3D CGI anime worth your time. About gem people, but not the Steven Universe kind.

**Little Witch Academia:** Harry Potter.

**Love, Chuunibyou, and Other Delusions:** Cute middle schoolers do things? Haven’t seen it.

**Lupin III:** Classic, classy thief steals riches and hearts. Got Miyazaki his start.

**Made in Abyss:** Don’t go exploring the big scary hole, kids. Don’t.\\

**March comes in like a Lion:** Drama about a chess prodigy and his relationships. One of the best. 

**Mawaru Penguindrum:** Brothers and penguins(?) try to help their sister. Haven’t seen it.

**Miss Kobayashi:** Fun, funny show about a woman who adopts a bunch of dragon people into her life

**Mob Psycho 100:** Cool, trippy, great action show about a kid with super psychic powers

**Monthly Girls’ Nozaki Kun:** High school girl’s crush on romance manga artist goes unnoticed; she becomes his assistant in this wacky, hilarious comedy about romance.

**My Teen Romantic Comedy SNAFU:** Catcher in the Rye if it were anime and there were three Holdens. Very good.

**Mushishi:** Cool-ass spirit detective does spirit detective shit

**Nagi no Asukara:** Very pretty show about water people(?) Haven’t seen it.

**Natsume’s Book of Friends:** Arguably the closest you’ll get to a Ghibli TV show. Guy has spirit friends.

**Noragami:** Haven’t seen it …. a fallen god is trying to get back on his feet(?)

**Ore Monogatari:** Gentle giant falls in love with pint sized classmate. Adorable as fuck.

**Polar Bear Cafe:** Polar bears and other animals run a cafe (?) Haven’t seen it.

**Shinsekai Yori:** WORLDBUILDING. New generation of humans trying to figure out about themselves(?)

**Shirobako:** An anime show about making anime shows. It’s incredible, heartwarming and educational.

**Showa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu:** Stand up comedy but it’s sit-down comedy and it’s very old fashioned. Character drama about artists in a dying medium in the 60s, 70s, 80s, and beyond. Slow burn that’s easily one of the best shows of the last few years, anime or no.

**So Ra No Wo To:** Girls in a small brigade run an army corps of musicians. Also they have a tank? There’s more to it but I can’t remember.

**Sound Euphonium:** High school concert band, and all the character drama and shenanigans that go with it. Very good.

**Tamako Market:** Girl living in a market district has fun shenanigans with friends. Warm and comfy. The talking bird grows on you. Oh, also there’s a dark-skinned prince who shows up.

**Tanaka kun is Always Restless:** haven’t seen this one -- it’s about a guy who’s always lazy. But supposedly it’s very good.

**Tatami Galaxy:** Very fast dialogue, weird visuals. About a guy figuring out his life in college. Once you get the hang of it, it’s very entertaining and relatable.

**Tsuki ga Kirei:** Adorable show about middle schoolers’ first love.

**Tsuritama:** Haven’t seen it. IIRC there’s a guy who’s like a mermaid? Comedy, I think.

**Usagi Drop:** Relaxing, sweet show about a bachelor who takes in his grandfather’s six year old daughter from an affair. 

**Violet Evergarden:** Gorgeous show about PTSD and a young woman who becomes a letter writer in a semi 1930s world. Don’t go in expecting an action show. 

**Yona of the Dawn:** Semi-historical action adventure about a princess and her crew who go rogue.

**Yuru Camp:** Comfy show about high schoolers camping. Will make you want to camp."
blood blockade battlefront,[deleted]
blood blockade battlefront,"Nichijou, Ping Pong the Animation, Sound! Euphonium, Kyousougiga, and A Place Further than the Universe are my next biggest recommendations.

Also, I actually almost didn't include Noragami, as I had some problems with the 1st season, but damn was Noragami Aragoto amazing. It's everything I love about battle shounen (a genre I'm not really a fan of) but without the filler. Too bad we'll never get a 3rd season."
blood blockade battlefront,"Haha yeah i decided to use english names unless it's so uncommon. I've seen a fair amount of people online refer to kekkai sensen by the english name, so i went with that. In contrast, I've literally never heard anyone call Nagi no Asukara by the english name: A Lull in the Sea."
blood blockade battlefront,"Agreed. One could make an argument that it's the anime equivalent to It's Always Sunny. 

Not me obvious, but someone else could."
blood blockade battlefront,"Watched it but didn't find it quite as funny as others. Then again, I actually like Isekai as a genre (I know some dismiss it) and would probably have recommended Overlord at least. Honorable mentions to Re:Zero, Death March, and even Knights & Magic IMO though I know that last one is held up by many as an example of what is wrong with Isekai shows. "
blood blockade battlefront,"It's so popular I feel the OP decided it didn't need another shout out.

But yeah, it's a pretty good show."
blood blockade battlefront,"It just annoys me how none of the heroes ever die.

Kills the suspense everytime they battle these villains who are more experienced and powerful than them."
blood blockade battlefront,Watching that show only makes me pine for OPM that much more. 
blood blockade battlefront,I feel it's just a copy of Naruto. 
blood blockade battlefront,How does it compare in tone/style etc to Hajime no Ippo? Definitely loving the idea of another boxing anime.
blood blockade battlefront,"Oh right, I should get around to watching that."
blood blockade battlefront,"Parasyte is really good, Imagine Japanese Peter Parker turned into venom before he ever became spider-man, and takes the responsibility to make sure to the best of his ability that humans and alien body snatchers are able to co exist secretly without everyone dying. 

"
blood blockade battlefront,I dunno those first two are the sort of over-recommended shows that the OP was trying to avoid. 
blood blockade battlefront,"> Next time I would include Animes that would appeal to Western Taste

Baccano!"
blood blockade battlefront,Psycho Pass season one is AMAZING
blood blockade battlefront,Pretty sure OP was going for non-generic picks.
blood blockade battlefront,"OPM, MHA and Psycho Pass are such cliche recommendations. They're good but defeat the whole purpose of this list. 

This whole ""Western Taste"" nonsense is so exaggerated "
blood blockade battlefront,"-	imo One Punch Man wore its premise thin pretty quickly
-	I guess I kinda liked My Hero Academia, but that's about it.
-	Psycho Pass sits just right outside my list because of the disappointing 2nd season.
-	I have to give it to you for Parasyte tho. Great show that I somehow forgot while making this list. Not sure which one it would replace tho (probably Kill la Kill or Tanaka-kun is Always Listless)"
blood blockade battlefront,I'd throw in Berserk and Hunter x Hunter and then call it a day.
blood blockade battlefront,"Do they get all emo and decide to defeat their enemies through power of love/friendship/telepathy/whatever?

Because I am watching Gundam Unicorn and it's abysmal. Especially since I watched Gundam 8th MS Team, Thunderbolt and Origins before this one and those seemed way superior even though Unicorn is supposed to be some hot stuff.

I mean, where did all that emo/telepathy stuff come from all of a sudden?  

"
blood blockade battlefront,"My taste overlaps with you quite a bit on live action. I couldn't get into Black Lagoon or Gurren Lagann, but I'll try to give Ergo Proxy, Steins;Gate, Psycho-Pass, and Ghost in the Shell a shot.

Thanks!"
blood blockade battlefront,This show was hilarious
blood blockade battlefront,I will never forgive Gainax for what they did in the finale. God fucking damn it. I'm pissed years later.
blood blockade battlefront,"Damnit how did i forget about this show? If I had to replace a show on my list with Space Brothers, it'd probably be Kill la Kill or Death Parade."
blood blockade battlefront,Agreed. Every anime fan needs more Jojo!
blood blockade battlefront,"Since you've seem Cowboy Bebop and Samurai Champloo, the logical next step is to see Space Dandy made by the same director. Where Cowboy Bebop was jazz and Samurai Champloo was hip hop, Space Dandy is disco/funk. It's also a lot weirder than the other two, but in a good way."
blood blockade battlefront,"My main recs would be Showa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu and Ping Pong the Animation. You could also maybe try Death Parade, Erased, Katanagatari, Natsume's Book of Friends, Shinsekai Yori, and The Tatami Galaxy."
blood blockade battlefront,"It's from the 90s but it basically takes the cake when it comes to throwing anime tropes on their head: Neon Genesis Evangelion.  Giant robots fighting giant... ""monsters"" plus depression."
blood blockade battlefront,"A little late but I would recommend these. parasyte, banana fish, Durarara, psycho pass, and dororo which is airing me but is very good."
blood blockade battlefront,"Watch kids on the slope, same person who did bebop Anh champloo"
blood blockade battlefront,Agreed. One of the best shows I’ve seen tbh.
Girls und Panzer,Cartoons about sports? No thanks.
Girls und Panzer,"I'm about halfway through season two of Haikyuu right now and I'm really enjoying it. I love how despite the necessary bending of time for the sake of story and character, they do as much as possible to ground the show in real tactics and explains itself and volleyball to the audience. Because of the writing the show could probably succeed with a much less realistic portrayal of sport but the fact that they put the effort in makes it that much better for me."
Girls und Panzer,No *Prince of Tennis* here?
Girls und Panzer,"Soccer also has:

- ""Area no Kishi"" (The Knight in the Area) 
- ""Keppeki Danshi! Aoyama-kun"" (Clean Freak! Aoyama-kun)

I don't know if they are on any streaming service or not since I don't use any."
Girls und Panzer,">Eyeshield 21

I really liked this show.  It was fun, exciting, funny. It showed an understanding of what makes American football a good sport.  Good depiction of why team sports in general bond diverse people together, even opponents.  Great depiction of how even if you have amazing talent you will need an insane amount of work to get anywhere."
Girls und Panzer,"I'll add a few more that you missed out:

# Football/soccer

**Aoki Densetsu Shoot!** *\[No official stream\]*

58 episodes and 1 short movie. No English dub.

>This anime is based on the manga, ""Shoot!"", which was published between 1990 and 2003. It won the 1994 Kodansha Manga Award for Shounen. The anime adaptation was broadcast from 1993 to 1994 and thus, does not cover the entirety of the manga. It tells the story of Tanaka Toshihiko (""Toshi"") and his 2 friends, Hiramatsu Kazuhiro and Shiraishi Kenji, who played football together during middle school and were known as the Kakenishi Middle School's Golden Trio, and now they have graduated to high school. In high school though, it's only Toshi who continues to play football. His 2 friends have dropped out of football due to their personal circumstances. They are still in the same high school, Kakegawa High School. The reason that Toshi joined Kakegawa High School is because of his football idol, Kubo Yoshiharu, who plays there. The portrayal of football in this anime is a bit more down to Earth compared with Captain Tsubasa, the preeminent football anime then. It is a contemporary of the basketball anime, Slam  Dunk.

**Hungry Heart: Wild Striker** *\[No official stream\]*

52 episodes. No English dub.

>This anime came out in 2002 at roughly the same time as the manga. It is the creation of Takahashi Youichi (the creator of Captain Tsubasa). Created to tap into the interest in football to tie-in with the 2002 World Cup jointly hosted by Japan and South Korea. The story is about Kanou Kyosuke, a teenage high school student, whose older brother, Kanou Seisuke, is a top Japanese professional football player that plays for A.C. Milan (they were giants in European football then). His older brother taught him how to play and love football but he finds himself being regularly compared to his older brother by others. This pressure of expectation made him lose his passion in the game. This anime covers his path back to find that passion again.

**Whistle!** *\[No official stream\]*

39 episodes. No English dub.

>Based on the manga of the same name. The English-translated manga is published by Viz Media. There are 24 volumes in total. The manga/anime is about a middle school boy named Kazamatsuri Sho who dreams of becoming a professional football player. However, he is short and not that good at it but he does have a passion for it and works hard to improve himself. He makes it into Musashi no Mori Junior High School which hosts a top class football team but he is way down the order. He transfers to Sakura Josui Junior High School to have a better chance to make it into the football team there. The school is not known for football but does have a football team there. When the Sakura Josui football team hears that he transferred in from Musashi no Mori, there were high expectations of him but he could not deliver those expectations. The anime covers his determination to improve himself and to defy the odds for a short player. It's a show that espouses positive values.

# Baseball

**Mix** *\[Funimation\]*

24 episodes. English dub available.

>This is the anime adaptation of Adachi Mitsuru's manga of the same name. The manga is still under serialisation with a monthly release of chapters. This manga is set in the same world as Adachi's classic manga, ""Touch"", but 25-26 years after. It is not necessary to have watched the older series. For those who have, it's like slipping into a pair of comfy home slippers. The story revolves around the 2 Tachibana brothers, Souichirou and Touma,  and their younger sister, Otomi. The 2 bothers are step-brothers to each other but it so happens that they were born on the same date and at approx. the same time (to different mothers, of course). The older brother, Souichirou, and the younger sister are from the maternal side, while the 2nd brother, Touma, is from the fraternal side. They are good at baseball with Souichirou being an excellent catcher and Touma being an excellent pitcher. They make a formidable battery. This is their story from late middle school to early high school. For those familiar with Adachi's works, this is very typical Adachi with his quirks in full display.

**H2** *\[No official stream\]*

41 episodes. No English dub.

>Another anime adaptation of a Adachi Mitsuru manga. This is an earlier manga than ""Mix"" but a later one than ""Touch"". The manga ran from 1992 to 1999. The anime adaptation ran from 1995 to 1996. This series revolves around the competition between Kunimi Hiro, a pitcher, and Tachibana Hideo, 3rd base and 4th batter. In middle school, together with their catcher and friend, Noda Atsushi, their middle school team won the national championships consecutively. However, both Kunimi Hiro and Noda Atsushi were diagnosed with career-ending sports injuries before high school. Thus, the both of them enrolled in Senkawa High School, a high school with no baseball team so that they would not be reminded of not being able to play baseball anymore, whereas Tachibana Hideo enrolled in Meiwa Daiichi High School, a high school with a powerhouse baseball team. Early in their high school life, it turns out Kunimi's and Noda's injuries were wrongly diagnosed and that they are in good health to continue playing baseball. They now decide to form a baseball team in Senkawa to continue their baseball career. The title, ""H2"", relates to the initials of their first name, Hiro and Hideo. It also relates to the initials of the first name of the 2 girls, Amamiya Hikari and Koga Haruka, who are a core part of this series. Amamiya Hikari is the neighbourhood childhood friend of Hiro that Hiro matchmakes with Hideo during primary school years while Haruka is the girl who has a passion for baseball in Senkawa."

You just seem to have a very rigid view of the things people enjoy tbh."
Girls und Panzer," I personally don't like anime much at all and love sports however there are a ton of NFL Players that watch a ton of anime, as well as NBA players. Im thinking its a generation thing, so I think they overlap a bit a more than people realize but yeah def not widespread."
Girls und Panzer,ew god no
Girls und Panzer,What the fuck... No. 
Girls und Panzer,"you know what, I'm glad someone else said it. Thought the same thing just an hour ago. /s"
Girls und Panzer,"Television already has what you are describing, it is called *anime*, it is made mostly in Japan, and is easy and abundantly available- like the rest of television- on TV and the internet. Should *all* TV be like just one specific kind of TV that not everyone likes? No, it obviously should not. "
Girls und Panzer,"Definitely not. I'll preface this with saying I absolutely hate anime, but I did give it an honest shot over the years.

On the one hand, anime can get pretty bizarre and I'm not too sure that western audiences are that inclined to watch half-naked, androgynous teens who barely reached puberty try to save the world (obviously i'm being hyperbolic here, but lots of anime can get pretty weird).

On the other hand, though -- and this is just my personal opinion -- anime is absolutely terrible at story telling. I've watched plenty in my life, from the more kid-oriented shows to more adult ones. Every single one (with the exception of maybe Cowboy Beebop, but I can't really remember anymore) conveys the story by *telling* not *showing*. What I mean is that most movies/shows/stories convey plots and backstories through subtle means of show and artistry. Lots of anime, however, simply hammer in exposition through use of gross amounts of dialogue. For example, I remember when Kil la Kill came out. Lots of people seemed excited about it so I gave it a shot. So much of it was just raw exposition; characters simply explaining through dialogue how everything in the universe worked. I hated it. Why not *show* me how the universe works, instead of spoon-feeding it to me through terribly written dialogue? Obviously, not every plot point can be shown, but anime takes spoon-fed exposition to a different and wholly unbearable level."
Girls und Panzer,Thats the most niche want for a US tv series I have ever read
Girls und Panzer,I'll just stick to Cory In The House and Sid the Science Kid for my two main animes
Girls und Panzer,Well what do you mean like shows with outlandish plots? live action would cost waaaay too much for something that silly not to mention I highly doubt anyone would watch it
Girls und Panzer,"I think we have seen shows that have taken a few cues from anime.  ""Into the Badlands"" immediately comes to mind.  Perhaps in the future there will be room for an anime style live action show or two, but should we replace all our dramas with shows about parentless teenagers roaming the countryside looking for a mcguffin to save the world?  Fuck no."
Girls und Panzer,"HAHAHAH

>   American live action shows about high school girls who engage in tank warfare.

I know, WTF man!"
Girls und Panzer,"Not in its entirety. More like, they should learn something from Japan, but US shouldn´t be like Japan in terms of TV, and vice versa. 

But I would like that US animated shows have more genre variety, beyond action or comedy. Why 98% of the adults shows are comedies? There can be one that is drama, or at least dramedy. 

Why can´t a Y7 show be a slice-of-life with more plot and character development? Hey Arnold is one of the few US shows I see that can pull off that.

"
Girls und Panzer,why not? I feel like US television has a disturbing lack of highschool girls and moe anyway

PJ Masks,"Disney was rumored to be interested in buying Hasbro back in, oh, 2012 or so, but they had just paid big for Lucasfilm and hadn't started seeing profit from it yet so it never happened.

While I'm not thrilled with Disney buying everything, it would've been nice to see ROM and Micronauts back in one piece again under the Marvel banner.

Oh, and DC wasn't bought by WB at any point.

Kinney National Services (began as a parking company) started diversifying,  and in 1967 bought National Periodical Publications  (DC Comics). 

Kinney didn't acquire Warner Brothers until 1969, and eventually, DC was folded into the eventual Warner Communications company that Kinney morphed into.

So, DC was part of the company before WB."

PJ Masks,"Yeah agree. So Hasbro is mainly a toy company and Nintendo is a gaming company. But I guess Hasbro is most known in movie/tv world.

Btw can Disney buy Nintendo? I mean is it possible according to japan/usa laws?"
PJ Masks,Are you sure? I thought the writers owned their respective franchises. i.e Akira Toriyama can give the license to adapt DragonBall into movies/tv/theme-parks/games. No?

[-Ron Swanson](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcAnhnmWPOI)"
PJ Masks,"9 months old we were watching mostly YouTube animated nursery rhymes....and occasional Mickey Mouse Clubhouse. Also, there's a Disney show called ""Little Einsteins"" that was great at that age, not sure if it's still on, but the show revolves around classical music. "
PJ Masks,"Seriously, WTF is wrong with y'all? Don't your kids get addicted to the screen soon enough? *smh*"
PJ Masks,"You sound like my great aunt. She keeps asking the same thing ""aren't you worried they will get addicted to tv"", my answer is always the same ""sounds like the safest addiction I've heard of"""
PJ Masks,"I would imagine it wouldn't be in that sale. 

  


  
Peppa Pig and PJ Masks still make a mint for them, and Hasbro isn't giving that up."
PJ Masks,"Death Row Records was part of eOne when Hasbro originally bought it, so funny"
PJ Masks,"The children's properties are not apart of the sale. What is for sale is the non-childrens assets, which include the production companies behind shows like Grey's Anatomy, Yellowjackets, and The Rookie among others."
The Royal House of Windsor,"I expect the show will be fine, but these ads are so embarrassing.

>**Keeping up with the Targaryens**

Kill me now."
The Royal House of Windsor,"Just looking at the trailer how beautifully it's lit. All these fantasy shows are always over lit and the costumes seem cheap, writing aside, GoT from beginning to end blew me away with their lighting, costume and set design"
The Royal House of Windsor,"The Targaryens has always been my favorite House, and their history when briefly mentioned always super intrigued me, I’m glad they made the first spin off about them cannot wait"
The Royal House of Windsor,"Martin once said said that he originally wanted to use very dark skin for the Targaryen’s otherworldliness but settled on grey hair/purple eyes because of the potential political implications behind violent Black invaders to a White continent. 

Looking at Coryls makes me wonder how that would have worked."
The Royal House of Windsor,"Matt Smith looks really out of place with that Targaryen hair. Still menacing in the face, a weird combo for sure, but intriguing also."
The Royal House of Windsor,"The article says this about Daemon:

>he serves on the Small Council as Lord Commander of the Kingsguard

Is the article wrong or did they change this in the TV show? His storyline doesn't really work if he is in the Kingsguard."
The Royal House of Windsor,"My hopes for this are pretty low, but from a creative asset viewpoint this puts anything Amazon is doing to complete shame."
The Royal House of Windsor,D and D are not involved so thank god.
The Royal House of Windsor,"Yeah, Id say I'm pretty *stunned* 

By how bad it looks"
The Royal House of Windsor,Two EW articles about House of the Dragon in one day huh?
The Royal House of Windsor,"These pictures all look like headshots taken in a studio right after they had their hair and makeup done. I know that's exactly what they are, but just doesn't look real. Hopefully the show is great though!"
The Royal House of Windsor,"Please please I just want winds of winter George please 

Rhllor hear me in my darkness and give me another book"
The Royal House of Windsor,[deleted]
The Royal House of Windsor,"Pretty excited for this but still lower expectations than GOTs. I have no hope in Amazons LOTRs show to honor Tolkien's or Peter Jackson's work, so I'm hoping this will at least feel like it belongs in the same world GOTs built"
The Royal House of Windsor,The adds are just awful. Keeping up with the Targaryens...
The Royal House of Windsor,I don't like the casting and i'm not even talking about Corlys here. The Targs just look meh.
The Royal House of Windsor,"Yeah man, I don’t care."
The Royal House of Windsor,The more I see the less interested I am. Not sure these folks understand how ad campaigns are supposed to work.
The Royal House of Windsor,"fuck the Targaryens, I want a Davos Seaworth spinoff."
The Royal House of Windsor,"Makes me wonder, was there ever a time where a prequel movie/tv show becomes a masterpiece despite the original having such shitty ending?"
The Royal House of Windsor,"I was willing to give it a chance, then read something about how it won't feature scenes of violence towards women because dumbass reasons and my interest plummeted, to say the least. They really cannot think audience is that stupid"
The Royal House of Windsor,"Out of all the new Game of Thrones  shows we’re getting, I can’t believe that HBO is not doing a Robert’s Rebellion series. That is probably the most hyped and anticipated era in the franchise."
The Royal House of Windsor,Do they though?
The Royal House of Windsor,Can we stop trying to profit off the corpse of Game of Thrones?
The Royal House of Windsor,who cares… we were let down 3 yrs ago & we’re not interested
The Royal House of Windsor,Why are the women 6s and 7s? No more hot actresses in Hollywood?
The Royal House of Windsor,"Sorry, the last season of GoT means I'm not gonna make that mistake twice."
The Royal House of Windsor,[deleted]
The Royal House of Windsor,Strange they got exclusive access to shoot this gallery but all the pictures look like pretty generic promo pics.
The Royal House of Windsor,I’m wondering if they should’ve done this when GOT was still current.
The Royal House of Windsor,I do not care.
The Royal House of Windsor,"""Don't be fucking rude."" Daemon while hitting Rhaenyra with a handbag."
The Royal House of Windsor,"It's E!, pretty run of the mill for them. Solid photoshoot though, they do look pretty fantastic in costume."
The Royal House of Windsor,"How many seasons they will make any idea 
Or they will make 8 seasons like games of thrones
If the seasons 1 of house of the dragons get biggest hits in 2022 tv shows."
The Royal House of Windsor,That’s e a me off the show
The Royal House of Windsor,"Other than the black dude with white dreads, everyone else is pretty unattractive. Is this on purpose?  Capture the real visuals of what medieval life was like?"
The Royal House of Windsor,"I think a big reason is that they actually look like the characters wear them. In the Wheel of Time show, which I thought wasn’t terrible, their dresses and tunics and shit look brand new in every shot. It’s hard to place how GoT did it differently but they just look like they are actually clothes that the character owns and wears some days lol"
The Royal House of Windsor,One thing about HBO they’re always going to give their shows proper lighting. It’s these streaming services like Amazon and Netflix that can’t seem to make a show without shitty flat lighting.
The Royal House of Windsor,Love all the costumes but Alicent Hightowers dress stands out to me as really cheap looking. That fabric looks like it's made out of plastic. Really weird - maybe that's just me though.
The Royal House of Windsor,"Lighting? In GoT? In the end, you couldn't see shit, everything was just dark."
The Royal House of Windsor,Visually stunning like a rich oil painting…. I’m still just not sure if I’m recovered enough from s7 & s8 plot plummet but will prob find a way to get past it to test-drive this.
The Royal House of Windsor,This show still gives me hope that we may get a season or 2 of Aegons Conquest. If they can make a show about the Targaryen civil war then surely there’s room to see how it all started.
The Royal House of Windsor,"> I’m glad they made the first spin off about them cannot wait

I'm so so glad they decided to go with this rather than the prequel North/White Walkers show. I always felt the politics were much more interesting than cliche supernatural evil trope."
The Royal House of Windsor,"Read the Fire and Blood if you're interested in the Targaryens.

The Dunk & Egg stories also take place during the Targaryen reign and you get to know a lot of them first hand."
The Royal House of Windsor,They insist on incest.
The Royal House of Windsor,"No, in 2013  he said he recently thought of that idea, it's not something he wanted to do in 1991."
The Royal House of Windsor,"I think this is why it works. We know not all of the Targaryans were beautiful and really, that white hair would look stupid on some of them."
The Royal House of Windsor,"I'll wait till I've actually seen it but I'm not overly enthusiastic about Matt Smith being in this. He has one way of acting that I just don't think comes across as very earnest, it always feels too theatrical but without any of the gravitas of someone like Ian McKellen."
The Royal House of Windsor,I assume they mean Lord Commander of the City Watch and simply made a mistake
The Royal House of Windsor,"They better not remove the actual Lord Commander, Criston Cole ""The Kingmaker"". It would literally destroy the entire plot of the Targ civil war."
The Royal House of Windsor,"They hella got it wrong, Criston Cole is a main character in the cast."
The Royal House of Windsor,They def made a mistake the Goldcloaks are heavily featured in the trailers
The Royal House of Windsor,"Why would it be pretty low? It's a series based on a story that has a completed ending from GRRM, is from HBO, and the showrunners are completely different from the original show."
The Royal House of Windsor,Have you seen The Boys? Or The Expanse (post acquisition)?
The Royal House of Windsor,"I agree with the first part, but not the latter.  There are some decent shows on Amazon that could easily have more entertainment value than this spinoff."
The Royal House of Windsor,George worked with the writing team and is an exec himself. After reading Fire and Blood I’m confident that this will be a pretty great series that will feel like the early seasons of GOT. The two imbeciles that ran GOT to the ground are not involved in this whatsoever.
The Royal House of Windsor,Considering this is adapting completed material they likely would have nailed it tbh.
The Royal House of Windsor,"They don’t need to be, this is a prequel, the damage they’ve done still gets to transcend their series and make this one utterly pointless."
The Royal House of Windsor,"Same here, and I’m not easily impressed. WOW, A BLUE CAR!!!"
The Royal House of Windsor,It's almost as if it's their big cover story and many people are interested in it!
The Royal House of Windsor,"Haha, and look at the comment votes.. Their social media agents are working overtime on those downvote buttons."
The Royal House of Windsor,Hard to get excited about TWOW when I know ADOS is never coming out
The Royal House of Windsor,I always figured that some Targaryans traits were dominant.
The Royal House of Windsor,"I assume that the Valeryon’s are still usually White and that  Coryl’s mother is a Summer Islander, resulting in his dark skin. The Varleryons are seafarers who go to far off, exotic places.  In the ASOIAF series,  Aegon IV has multiple bastards with a Summer Islander female pirate named Bellegere Otherys. Bellegere is said to have been ""as black as a pot of ink"". They can steal that plot for Coryl’s birth. 

The genetics in  Martin’s world seem to be influenced entirely by magic. It’s not so much that darker = dominant like in our on. For instance, it would be statistically improbable for most of the Stark siblings to have red hair and blue eyes like in the books. It’s also extremely improbable that families would retain the exact same hair and eye color combination  for thousands of years."
The Royal House of Windsor,How is George gonna explain how the children of Daeron II are almost all white hair pale skin amethist eye depsite their mother being olive skin dark hair brown eyes?
The Royal House of Windsor,"They are very good actors, that's what matters. And costumes are beautiful, better than anything on TV right now. This baseless hate..."
The Royal House of Windsor,"Yeah man, it seems like you do."
The Royal House of Windsor,"“This ad campaign is not personally tailored to me, they should all be sacked”"
The Royal House of Windsor,Not sure you understand your just one person and millions are interested
The Royal House of Windsor,"The godfather 2, better call saul, red dragon technically, rise of the planet of the apes, rogue one and temple of doom. 
You also cant really call it  a prequel when it forsnt included any of the original characters, I would just call it  a spinoff"
The Royal House of Windsor,Why would the ending of one show have any effect on another show ?
The Royal House of Windsor,"The one with the Olivia Cooke quotes?  I'm pretty she was meaning shit like the stupid sexposition and the weird rapey scenes like that one with Jaime and Cersi next to Joffrey laying in state, not general violence/murder/etc."
The Royal House of Windsor,"Because you need to recast a bunch of popular characters and it’s a story that is pretty much known by everyone who watched the show. 

I think the Aegon Conquest would be a better war to focus on because it’s far enough back where everything is new but you still get the major houses and can extend it for years."
The Royal House of Windsor,"Because grrm doesnt want to do that as it would reveal too many details about his future book, but they are doing a broadway show about it"
The Royal House of Windsor,Seeing a young Bobby B cutting down MFers and bedding every women in sight would've been amazing.
The Royal House of Windsor,dont watch it? who is putting a gun in your head?
The Royal House of Windsor,Can we stop being delusional by acting like game of thrones is dead?
The Royal House of Windsor,"GoT was one of the best shows ever at the time. It's clear that people love the world and that its main issie was strictly the writing. Besides, its literally been like 4 years since it ended"
The Royal House of Windsor,"Sorry, I didnt realise you spike for 30 million people"
The Royal House of Windsor,"This is such a funny thing for you to have typed out. 

Get a grip"
The Royal House of Windsor,Why point out the women? They are on average definitely more attractive than the male actors shown in the pictures.
The Royal House of Windsor,What about the men! Hollywood needs more daddies in media lmao
The Royal House of Windsor,Yes you do.
The Royal House of Windsor,Then stop reading the article ana d going g on forums
The Royal House of Windsor,I would watch that!
The Royal House of Windsor,"""Viserys, stop taking pictures of yourself, your brother's going to jail!"""
The Royal House of Windsor,"If Matt Smith can successfully do Charlie Manson, playing a Targaryen will be a piece of cake."
The Royal House of Windsor,"Chadwick Boseman's first appearance as Black Panther on their cover, and all they had to say was: ^^^*Meow*"
The Royal House of Windsor,"This is Entertainment Weekly, which is kind of like E! had a baby with Rolling Stone. They usually have really good TV exclusives before shows premiere, but sometimes you’ll get something pseudo-tabloid like this."
The Royal House of Windsor,I'd expect 3 to 4 at best. Not really sure though but that's what people have been saying and it's also a decent amount of entrainment without risking stretching the story.
The Royal House of Windsor,I think in general the costumes in GOT were more muted colors. Wheel of time has high saturation costumes which looks new and bright. Most people in GOT wear grey brown and black and even when Daenerys is wearing white it’s like a cream instead of bright white
The Royal House of Windsor,"In wheel of time, everyone looks like they’re in church choir robes."
The Royal House of Windsor,"I read that it's something that HBO always managed to do well. Apparently, some of it comes from having such large archives of props and clothes, they reuse them so they look worn and used like normal clothes while shows like The Witcher are creating from the ground up so things look oddly too clean and untarnished."
The Royal House of Windsor,"I might be wrong cause I have not read the books yet but I read somewhere that in the books it is explained that the people living in that age are more advanced when it comes to hygiene and self care and cleanliness from past ages before the destruction of the world, or something like that so in my opinion it doesn't break the immersion."
The Royal House of Windsor,"Same how I felt about the Witcher. Sometimes too much is put on world building when the world isn’t built enough where the characters are currently standing. Things should look lived in, including the characters own bodies. I don’t want someone on a 5 day quest through the wilderness to have nice hair and no dirt on their face. Grime that shit up"
The Royal House of Windsor,I agree… it looks like they wanted to give it dragon-scale vibes with the pattern but they skimped on the texture and quality. The material just looks off… regardless some of the others are stunning!
The Royal House of Windsor,You're right in regards to moments in season 8 but before that the shows lighting was phenomenal.
The Royal House of Windsor,"I feel like Aegon's conquest would be hard to make interesting since Aegon is just too OP and doesn't face any real hardship until Dorne which is just a seven year stalemate until everyone just sort of agrees to go home.

Argilac is an experienced warrior king with many years of battle under his belt: kill him in one fight after roasting his back-up army with a dragon. Harren rules from the biggest castle in the world: melt it with a dragon. The Eyrie is virtually impregnable due to it's position in a mountaintop: fly over it with a dragon. The Westerlands and the Reach, the two biggest and most powerful kingdoms, unite under one grand army that could easily take down a dragon: so use 3 dragons. The North. Are we gonna get Stark vs Targ in some War of Ice and Fire? Nope. They give up immediately because motherfucking dragons."
The Royal House of Windsor,"I think it wouldn't be super interesting because Aegon basically arrived and conquered everything with dragons.

They'll probably mention it in the show, though, because it was only 100 years earlier."
The Royal House of Windsor,I want the adventures of Dunk the Lunk and his squire Egg.
Big Mouth,Honestly I’d be surprised if at least some of them didn’t watch it
Big Mouth,"The nihilism of the show can be a bit much for that age group (heck, it's a bit much for me and I consider myself to be fairly closely aligned with nihilism in my personal worldview)."
Big Mouth,"If you haven’t seen it yet, I would recommend the show Sex Education. 

It’s a refreshing look at high schoolers navigating this sort of thing."
Big Mouth,"There are episodes that could pretty much replace sex ed in school. lol

I mean, the show is ridiculously over the top but they aren't lying"
Big Mouth,"I think Sex Education is the better show for this 

Although it’s frankness is a bit unrealistic regarding a school wide culture, the problems the kids face are very realistic imo."
Big Mouth,[deleted]
Big Mouth,"All I can say is thank God I don't have people assuming my children are stupid and trying to ""educate"" them by recommending tv shows. Like what?

TV is for entertainment, my friend. Not life lessons. Just because you and your stupid friends were raised poorly, it doesn't mean you need to project that onto other people's children."
Big Mouth,"7th graders today don't watch TV shows, they watch Youtubers, other people play videos games, and Tik Tok."
Big Mouth,"I have, and I love it... but it's for an older crowd. As you say, good for High Schoolers, whereas Big Mouth is just the right amount of dumb irreverence, grossness, and honesty for the puberty crowd."
Big Mouth,"I wonder. Brit kids always seem a tad more mature than yanks... at least in media. But maybe that's just a foreigners fascination with a different culture's portrayal. 

I mean most American teen movies and shows (not on The Disney Channel) have idealized, more mature than their age main characters."
Big Mouth,"But its all done out of frame or via visual metaphor... and pretty cleverly so. Its not titillating, but funny and educational. Yeah, it can be gross and weird... but so is sex until you get the hang of it."
Big Mouth,"Ummm... do you also think books are just for lazing the day away? Or songs are just for singing and those silly lyrics don't mean anything? 

Media is how we transmit culture, friendo.

And hearing the things kids say when they think I'm not listening is enough to tell me that the majority of middle schoolers are just as clueless about sex and relationships as we were."
Big Mouth,That's a hell of a generalization
Big Mouth,Can confirm. I have a 6th grader.
Big Mouth,Lot of people who have no or limited relationships with 13 year olds are downvoting you. Seventh grade teacher here too and they absolutely give barely any fucks about tv. YouTube and tiktok creators are their celebs.
Big Mouth,Damn straight. I am damn glad I have the golden girls growing up. They taught me a lot of useful life lessons and instilled some good morals in me.
Big Mouth,"Good books and good music are ways to teach lessons and transmit ideas.

You are attempting to teach life lessons through a shitty cartoon.

If you want to teach your children life lessons through a shitty cartoon, be my guest. Do not go around trying to interject your poor parenting techniques into the lives of other people's children.

Once again: just because you were raised poorly, it does not mean you get to use shitty parenting on other people's children. Let other people raise their children."
Big Mouth,"But not far off, based on the anecdotal evidence I have from my students. Seriously, the only actual TV any of them are interested in this year is that fucking Dahmer dramatization... and even THAT is streaming. 

Everything else is reels, tiktoks, and twitch."
Big Mouth,"Yup, I teach 5th-8th graders. I'm telling you, it's not even like a broadcast TV vs Streaming like it was a few years ago. If it isn't anime or a massive show like Stranger Things these kids aren't watching it"
Big Mouth,"The condom bit gets me every time~ Also, the cake shaped like Florida. I had forgotten about that one until it showed back up here on reddit the other day~"
Big Mouth,"Man, you sound like a massive tool. This superiority complex blindspot you have doesn't do you any favors."
Big Mouth,"I would NOT have pegged Monster as the hot new teen sensation lol. But yeah, you're a teacher so you definitely know better. The comment just irked me cause when I was that age I always had a book in my hand and the stereotype was ""they all just play video games"""
Big Mouth,"Dude, you admit you were raised poorly; you admit you find some significance about life in a raunchy, shitty little cartoon. I have no problem with this. That's your life and your issues.

I have a problem with you assuming everyone was raised as poorly as yourself and hoping to push the results of your poor upbringing onto others. I am not making this up. These are the things you've described about your own life.

Do not go around showing children shitty little cartoons in the hopes of teaching them life lessons. It is not your place and it is not your business. Feel free to do that with your own children because, apparently, the concept of talking to them will be foreign to you."
Big Mouth,"Well, those kids still exist... but as before, so it is now, they are a fraction of students in my classes.

When I was a kid, we were split along the Breakfast Club lines with a dash of rappers for flavor."
Big Mouth,I feel bad for any children you have. You would be an absolute shit stain of a parent.
Big Mouth,And I feel bad for the children this dude has to interact with because he's fixated on projected his poor upbringing and stunted development onto others.
Big Mouth,"Parents like you are the direct cause of poor upbringing and stunted development. 

Crawl back in your cave and let someone, literally anyone other than you, raise your children so they don't end up like...well, you to be honest."
Big Mouth,"Because I am able to talk to my children and educate them appropriately on matters pertaining to their sexual development rather than...hoping a cartoon does it?

Okay. You're certainly a sane individual and we should take you very seriously."
Big Mouth,"I'm not sure I'm completely on board with kids watching the entirety Big Mouth - maybe select segments. But no one was saying this should be anyone's sole source of sex education, which you seemed to be implying.


And parents should certainly be able to talk to their kids about this stuff, but there's value in also hearing about it from a peers' perspective. Big Mouth could be used to break the ice and make the discussion less serious and scary.


It's weird that you seem to think good television can't educate or spark important discussions about the world, but books and music can. Would the same scenarios written down in book form be educational in your mind?


And if there's a concern about it being a ""cartoon"" - I also don't understand the stigma there. A show being animated doesn't detract from the story or lessons. It just allows for more stylization and freedom."
Big Mouth,"7 seasons?! Wow, didn’t realize it’s been on for that long. Does it have some incredibly short seasons or something like that?"
Big Mouth,These shows are so cheap to produce relative to a LA show and they get as many viewers.
Big Mouth,Damn. I haven’t watched since season 2. Was there really enough to keep it going for 5 more seasons?
Big Mouth,"As someone who went through watching a grand father progress in to dementia, I wasn't prepared for the ninth episode of Human Resources. 

It was quite amazing to see how well they captured and personified the same emotions I went through especially with Keith from Grief.

Hit real hard which is something I would not expect from BM/HR but am so grateful that they did it."
Big Mouth,IM GOING THROUGH CHANGES
Big Mouth,What are you gonna do?
Big Mouth,"I'm caught up with all of Big Mouth, so far. I love it haha but how is Human Resources, asking those who have watched it all or enough of it to form a decent opinion about it. It is in my Netflix queue but haven't started watching yet. Is Human Resources worth the try?"
Big Mouth,"Cool. I did not care for this series when it first came out, seemed ugly and just full of nothing but dick jokes for middle schoolers to laugh at. But then I kept watching and while it's still ugly and still has a bunch of shitty jokes it also has some good ones and more than that feels like it's trying to put out a lot of useful messages for teenagers about puberty, life and such and can be surprisingly nuanced. 

Ditto on Human Resources which has more themes for adults such as ""Why do I not love my baby, I'm the worst mother ever"" and grieving a parent with alzheimers and seeing the perspective of that parent with alzheimers.


TLDR: On the surface this show seems like the ugliest stupidest waste of animation ever but if you give it a chance it's pretty good and I wish I had this when I was a teenager."
Big Mouth,Human Resources was hilarious. Loved it more than Big Mouth.
Big Mouth,"Is it an amazing show? No. But I enjoy it. Coach Steve, Maury and the old hormone monster are funny. I'll always take more John Mulaney and Jason Mantzoukas.

It's a good mindless comedy. The jokes can get pretty cringey. I don't really like Nick Kroll's humor, I couldn't stand Kroll Show or The League. But Big Mouth and Human Resources have their moments.

Neither show needs a big final season. They don't need to wrap anything up in a significant way. I don't care about the stories. I'll keep watching it as mindless background noise if they keep pumping them out. It definitely does get cringey and hard to watch a lot though."
Big Mouth,"When I first saw this show, i was like ""what the hell is this garbage. wait, ew, why are they showing this!? this is a cartoon, but still....""

Then they show Coach Steve's hormone monster and I laughed harder than I'd laughed in really really really long time. That kind of laugh where you have to force yourself to stop laughing so you can breathe and not pass out. After that, i was like okay. This is funny.

You have to look at this with the mindset of nudity not being a big deal. If you're prudish about nudity and things like that, this show isn't for you. It's a show for adult and maybe older teens and it's about the comedy of growing up in middle school and how we're all basically psychopaths at that age.

Honestly, i wouldn't say it's a must watch like some shows. the best part is when Coach Steve is involved. I don't think he's main character material though. They use him just enough (at least in the 2 or 3 seasons I've watched). If there were a show just about him, I don't know if it would work. He makes a really great side character."
Big Mouth,I love the theme song to Human Resources
Big Mouth,"Fuck yes! I'm happy about Big Mouth, but I am so fucking excited about Human Resources. By far, the biggest surprise out of any TV show I've seen this year. 

There's emotion, great characters, and it's honestly so funny. Not to mention emotional as hell. Episode 9 had me in tears. Super excited to see where it goes."
Big Mouth,"Wow people who don't like Big Mouth *really* have to let you know about how much they don't like it, huh?"
Big Mouth,must be cheap to make as well
Big Mouth,this show is disgusting.
Big Mouth,Honestly I’m obsessed with this universe and it’s one of the few shows I watch the new season the moment it’s out lol. I’m personally very excited even if y’all aren’t 🤷🏼‍♂️
Big Mouth,I really prefer the monster pov that Human Resources provides.  Watching kids go through puberty is funny and all but a bit tiresome after a couple of seasons.  To me Human Resources is the superior show right now.
Big Mouth,"This show is at its best barely watchable and has been on for 7 seasons?  


""new golden age of television"" my ass."
Big Mouth,This show is fucking horrid.
Big Mouth,eh they really need to wrap up big mouth it ran way past its sell by date.  human resources basically picks up the slack
Big Mouth,I wouldn’t have guessed big mouth would destroy the Netflix 3 seasons limit but good for them it’s hilarious.
Big Mouth,They’re beating a dead dick at this point
Big Mouth,"I can't imagine why their subscriber base continues to decline. 

[s]"
Big Mouth,This show is on its seventh fucking season?
Big Mouth,"Judging from the comments, this is a very polarizing show. I love it so I can't wait for more."
Big Mouth,"I can't finish season 1, i didn't laugh, the joke felt... weird, the black teacher humour seems forced to me, i stop watching and never try again after watching that episode where a 13yo girl start learning how to masturbate. the only thing that made me watch this far because i kinda like the story, about their friendship, etc. but didn't like the joke at all

does it get better, or is this show not for me?"
Big Mouth,Can someone explain to me who this show is for? The humor is obviously way too mature for kids/preteens but the plot seems hella immature for adults. Is it for teenagers?
Big Mouth,"Damn some of you are big mad people like stupid shit, it’s not that deep lmao"
Big Mouth,"I hope big mouth gets canceled before Human Resources. While I love big mouth, Human Resources was extra fascinating, and fun."
Big Mouth,Idk how HR will do. It’s so diff from the big mouth show. But it’s still good when you move it away from big mouth.
Big Mouth,Atta boy Nick this man’s eating
Big Mouth,Am I the only one who doesn't like the show because it's portraying sexuality in children? I find it mildly icky. Other people I know love it.
Big Mouth,What's with the hate in the comments? Show is good
Big Mouth,Who the fuck watches this shit
Big Mouth,whatcha gonna do?
Big Mouth,Yay! Human Resources came out the gate running. Episode nine made me cry like a bitch. I cannot wait for season 2.
Big Mouth,This show is horrible honestly lol
Big Mouth,"Great show that I've really enjoyed, but at the beginning of season 5 I felt I had had enough. First time that's happened to me. Dropping a show I like, before it's done, simply because I'm satiated :)"
Big Mouth,Love this news! Absolutely love both shows!
Big Mouth,"Big Mouth has gotten really gross, so I gave up on it a couple seasons ago. Haven’t checked out Human Resources yet."
Big Mouth,No. Please no.
Big Mouth,"I watched 4 or 5 episodes of Big Mouth and I honestly just don’t get the appeal. To me, I’m shocked it’s gone on for 6 season."
Big Mouth,I'm so ashamed at how happy this show makes me.
Big Mouth,"I like the show, but introducing new monsters every series gets a bit old and makes things overcrowded. I wish they'd stopped at the Shame Wizard."
Big Mouth,"pays millions for new series

kills off your favorite franchise

kills off new series

renews one of the horrendous looking adult animations

repeat for the Nth time"
Big Mouth,Going to hang myself if my gf makes me watch another Instalment of either. Fucking hate it
Big Mouth,I couldn't survive the first episode.  How is it at season 7???
Big Mouth,I love human resources cuz it remind me of the office tbh.
Big Mouth,I'm honestly pretty tired of John Mulaney
Big Mouth,Like cockrock this show just speaks to my inner child. Also like Jackass.
Big Mouth,"the original had some charm to it, but Human Resources - I couldn’t last 10 minutes"
Big Mouth,"Many quality shows on Netflix get cancelled too soon yet Big Mouth gets 7 seasons.

Guessing BM gets good ratings.

Don't see what others see in it. The first season was kinda good, better than my low expectations for it. 2nd season was meh, had to drop it mid way through the third season as it got really bad. But clearly other Netflix watchers don't share my opinion if Netflix keeps renewing it."
Big Mouth,Sad Netflix is more proud of this shitty franchise than BoJack Horseman
Big Mouth,The show made for socially awkward kids that never had sex as high schoolers…. Shocking that it’s done decent
Big Mouth,We love this show. Never have I watched anything where I can guarantee a laugh every episode and sit and mong watching wife zero though. It's perfect in every way.
Big Mouth,"Ew, why?"
Big Mouth,"Ive been creeped out by Nick Kroll since 'The League', Big Mouth just proved to deepen this feeling.

Ive heard good things about Human Resources tho, maybe ill give it a go."
Big Mouth,Have 0 clue how it lasted this long
Big Mouth,Could I please just get more seasons of the Kroll Show?
Big Mouth,"I don’t care for Big Mouth at all, but I absolutely loved Human Resources."
Big Mouth,"I love Big Mouth. I feel like it nailed everything about suburban boys' puberty perfectly. Tito was a little too spot on for my comfort, but she fit in well. But I very much dislike everything about the lovebug, Walter. The other lovebugs are fine. But less Walter is needed in both shows. I think it's his character's desire to ramp up the cringy bullshit to 11 at every opportunity. But I guess that's the point of a puberty lovebug."
Big Mouth,"Big Mouth is awesome, Human Resources is just too much, as hard as it is to follow a story line, this has like 37 constant story lines."
Big Mouth,But BoJack was forced to wrap it all up in half a season or risk being cancelled...
Big Mouth,There’s already 6 seasons of that garbage? I didn’t even know it had a spin-off
Big Mouth,"Big Mouth is great, Human Resources on the other hand seems like a bit of a struggle and plots are all over the place."
Big Mouth,Big Mouth is extremely overrated
Big Mouth,I know someone else must be clenching their fists since BoJack only got six seasons
Big Mouth,This show is so cringe and edgelord material.
Big Mouth,“Worst show on internet gets inexplicably renewed again”
Big Mouth,I hope this means Inside Job will get a similar run. I didn’t get into Big Mouth but I’ve watched Inside Job half a dozen times now lol
The Magic School Bus Rides Again,I hate flash animation so much
The Magic School Bus Rides Again,"Hold up, is that Lin-Manuel Miranda singing the theme song?"
The Magic School Bus Rides Again,Damn. I'm a grown ass man and almost wyled out 'cause I thought Ms. Frizzle straightened her hair in the thumbnail lol
The Magic School Bus Rides Again,I wonder if they'll include those after episode phone calls from the original that tried to explain things in more detail that they didn't have time to explain during the actually episode. That was one of my favourite parts of the original.
The Magic School Bus Rides Again,"I don't understand how they chose which kids should return. Clearly there are versions of Ralphie, Arnold, Carlos, and Dorothy Ann, but nobody else looks similar to their old selves, and there's there's not a hint of Phoebe at all! Could she have returned to her old school?"
The Magic School Bus Rides Again,"The ""Adam Ruins Everything"" parody of the Magic School bus has better animation that this.

The Magic School Bus Rides Again,New link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoiTW2zw80c
The Magic School Bus Rides Again,Netflix don't you dare touch my blues clues now!
The Magic School Bus Rides Again,Did it already get pulled down?
The Magic School Bus Rides Again,"Eh. It looks like Lily Tomlin is at least a recurring role as the original Miss Frizzle, so I'm mostly appeased. "
The Magic School Bus Rides Again," I have very mixed feelings about this. One of the biggest draws of TMSB was that it was freely available over-the-air on PBS and local stations. It allowed science to kids who otherwise didn't get any, and inspired an entire generation. Having it produced by netflix just feels.......wrong. 

also I hate the animation style(flash animation), it's very clearly budget/cheap with WAY less detail than the original series. It looks worse, which is the opposite of what should have happened. I don't say that out of nostalgia, i just watched some of the original series, looks much better than this. 

That said, I'm excited to see it and I hope it is actually educational like it should be and not just a pandering kids show reboot."
The Magic School Bus Rides Again,the voice doesnt fit the character
The Magic School Bus Rides Again,"There are no Carlos puns, what the heck?"
The Magic School Bus Rides Again,Netflix is spending $6 billion dollars on content this year and they are putting out a product that looks worse than it's counterpart did 20 years ago on public broadcasting.
The Magic School Bus Rides Again,"So ignoring the animation complaint (based off her youtube kids viewing history, I know my three year old doesn't give a shit about animation quality) and assuming that this reboot keeps with the original in focusing on actual science (looking at you Bill), I'm surprisingly excited for this!  It's encouraging that Lily Tomlin is willing to reprise her role and Kate McKinnon can be genuinely funny on SNL.  Honestly, the more educational options I have that entertain her, the less times I have to hear Johnny Johnny or Finger Family."
The Magic School Bus Rides Again,"I know we're not supposed to judge too much based on just animation, but if they're putting out something that looks this bad despite being a big company that should clearly have resources to do better, it's a **big red flag** that they aren't really caring about this beyond being a cash grab."
The Magic School Bus Rides Again,Did it have to be hideous?
The Magic School Bus Rides Again,ITT: This thing isn't exactly like MY childhood so it's terrible despite not having actually seen it.
The Magic School Bus Rides Again,"uh........ wow the animation got worse, and they replace Ms.Frizzle?????? what.."
The Magic School Bus Rides Again,Time for another cash grab!
The Magic School Bus Rides Again,Wow this looks like garbage. 
The Magic School Bus Rides Again,"The lady's name is Ms. Frizzle. The creators REALLY found it necessary to give her a non frizzy hair style? Can't the world leave us some curly haired mentors? Must they all be so perfectly coiffed?!?! Why cruel world, why?!?"
The Magic School Bus Rides Again,"I thought it was ok. It's flash animation, which sucks, but did anyone expect Netflix to go with actual animation? I mean most people go with it, it shouldn't be a surprise. "

The Magic School Bus Rides Again,"Can people please stop with the shitty reboots of beloved children's shows? Only good one I've seen is DuckTales. Just stop. This Flash animation looks fucking awful. My Little Pony looks better than this, and it *also* uses Flash!"
The Magic School Bus Rides Again,Video is private?
The Magic School Bus Rides Again,Ms fizzle looks like she she's in her 20s
The Magic School Bus Rides Again,The video has been deleted.
The Magic School Bus Rides Again,I'm not feeling the animation...but I might watch it to see rather it's good as the original.
The Magic School Bus Rides Again,this is the first nostalgia reboot I'm going to have to watch
The Magic School Bus Rides Again,Loving that theme song. That's Lin Manuel right?
The Magic School Bus Rides Again,"Egh... 

Same art style as that upcoming [Whacky Races Reboot.] (https://youtu.be/MZbTe4z6L-I?t=1s)

Decent idea, shit-lazy animation.

The only thing the whacky races reboot has going for it, is that stellar orchestra soundtrack. How could magic schoolbus screw up the one thing that was majorily iconic, the soundtrack.

[More whacky races reboot footage for those not yet convinced it's going to be mediocre at best.] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHgXBkFP6s4)"
The Magic School Bus Rides Again,Why didn't they just have Kate McKinnon be Miss Frizzle and leave out the seemingly pointless passing-the-torch thing?
The Magic School Bus Rides Again,This looks so bad! They should've brought by Lily (orginal voice). I only thought Kate M was cast as Ms. Frizzle because the orginal actor died...
The Magic School Bus Rides Again,I'm not feeling the animation...but I might watch it to see rather it's good as the original.
The Magic School Bus Rides Again,This animation looks awful. The original will forever remain a classic in my heart. 
The Magic School Bus Rides Again,"So, wait... Lily Tomlin voices Ms. Frizzle, but then, she somehow has a sister who also teaches that's voiced by Kate Mckinnon?

Why couldn't we have just had Lily Tomlin? "
The Magic School Bus Rides Again,"Welp.

Guess I'll file this under the ""bad reboots of beloved childhood cartoons"" category.

Right next to Teen Titans GO and that new Powerpuff Girls reboot."
The Magic School Bus Rides Again,Thanks for being a dick...I guess?
The Magic School Bus Rides Again,I think that this might be the new magic school bus for this generation. Will I like it or will it compare to the original? Hell no! But it still looks like an entertaining cartoon that will work for kids today. 
The Magic School Bus Rides Again,">flash """"""""""animation""""""""""

Into the trash it goes!"
The Magic School Bus Rides Again,"Ew, the animation. Good to see the theme is still good, though. But why. There's no need for a reboot, I feel, if kids still watch the original version in elementary school to this day.. But who knows, it may be decent at best "
The Magic School Bus Rides Again,"I think it's worth noting that while the animation does look pretty wonky, it is a show for children. People on Reddit are going to pick that apart, sure, but if most kids are like my little cousins, they eat that kind of animation up. As long as the lessons are good, I can see this show getting a lot of good reception. "
The Magic School Bus Rides Again,I'm not feeling the animation...but I might watch it to see rather it's good as the original.
The Magic School Bus Rides Again,"ITT: people bitching about animation quality in a show about science, while living in a world where really detailed animation is expensive and time consuming "
The Magic School Bus Rides Again,This looks awful
The Magic School Bus Rides Again,"I'm totally baffled that a new Magic School Bus isn't appealing to the grown-ass men and women on Reddit.

This was, at most, something we'd watch one time for nostalgia. It wasn't made for us."
The Magic School Bus Rides Again,Was the demand for a Magic School Bus Netflix reboot really that great? Because I swear this is the first time I've seen the show mentioned on Reddit in the 2 years I've been visiting.....
The Magic School Bus Rides Again,Looks bad. Glad the original Frizzle was in it for a bit. Not a fan of McKinnon. Pronouns. 1/10
The Magic School Bus Rides Again,"That's great and all, but I'm tired of remakes. I know it's hard to come up with something good, but if there's no incentive this will go on for more 10 years. "
The Magic School Bus Rides Again,"Not really feeling the animation for the show, but I'll still probably check it out to see how it compares to the original."
The Magic School Bus Rides Again,"I know the flash like animation is for the kids, since that's practically what almost all the cartoons have. So the kids need to already feel familiarized by it once they watch one episode. 

But man... this show was my childhood and I feel a bit disappointed in the quality. But I can see myself enjoying a bit of it as a kid.  "
The Magic School Bus Rides Again,I came to Reddit to post about this but as you have beat me to it you have my upvote
The Magic School Bus Rides Again,"I was gonna say what is this shit, then I heard Lin-Manuel Miranda."
The Magic School Bus Rides Again,"A question I have is what separates Ms. Frizzle's sister from, well... Ms. Frizzle? It is a rather small sample size for her character, but so far, she just seems like a less enthusiastic and more bland Frizz. I don't mind adapting, changing, or adding characters, in fact for a new generation and as a reboot, you need to adapt or die and mix things up some, but I really can't tell what makes her different from a design perspective."
The Magic School Bus Rides Again,"If they're gonna go this route, then I must say I'm ok with this. As much as I loved The Magic School Bus, I'm 24 now. I'm not gonna binge on this show like I do Stranger Things, HOC, etc. The animation is a lot newer which is great considering the original Magic School Bus ended 20 years ago, and I'm happy that they updated the theme song rather than completely make a new one. Granted the show has yet to air, but if future generations should start learning about the awesomeness of science, than I'm happy this is the route they're going unlike a guy whose show didn't ""save"" anything. "
The Magic School Bus Rides Again,Fuck you guys. I'm excited for my kid to be able to watch new episodes of The Magic School bus.
The Magic School Bus Rides Again,Will a talking vagina be telling the kids to go gay?
The Magic School Bus Rides Again,"""Please let this be a good trailer.""

""Animated with flash? No way!"""
The Magic School Bus Rides Again,"If I'm honest, I'm just glad it's still in 2D. We don't have too many of those right now."
The Magic School Bus Rides Again,"Flash animation can come out fine if it is used properly.  Bojack Horseman uses flash animation and has some of the most beautiful animated environments on television in my opinion. Bob's Burgers and Ugly Americans are also good examples of good flash animation for a television show. 

All this being said, this does not look like it is using flash well at all, instead it looks like it is being used strictly to cut costs and streamline production. "
The Magic School Bus Rides Again,"It's not Flash itself, it's the ""Flash style"" that comes from using it to cut corners like most big companies do these days."
The Magic School Bus Rides Again,[deleted]
The Magic School Bus Rides Again,"Meh, it's not a surprise. Flash is used for everything, because it's cheap."
The Magic School Bus Rides Again,"You can do good things with Flash, it's a matter of effort, not the tool. Like the Unity engine, you can do some amazing things with that engine, most people don't though."
The Magic School Bus Rides Again,"Definitely sounded like it, he's slowly making his way into being a staple of this generation's childhood. "
The Magic School Bus Rides Again,Yup: https://twitter.com/Lin_Manuel/status/905092369674104833

The Magic School Bus Rides Again,[deleted]
The Magic School Bus Rides Again,"Whoever it was, they need to do a redo, that sounded absolutely atrocious. "
The Magic School Bus Rides Again,Maybe they'll have the original Miss Frizzle do those parts
The Magic School Bus Rides Again,"Phoebe definitely went to Vassar college
"
The Magic School Bus Rides Again,"With Netflix producing, I'm surprised they didn't remove all of the white kids entirely and replace Ms Frizzle with her fat, disabled, Muslim, lesbian, transgender, adopted sister who's overstayed her student teaching visa."
The Magic School Bus Rides Again,I have no idea why that was a magic school bus parody but I'm glad it was
The Magic School Bus Rides Again,"To be fair, that was just a short, while this is a full blown 13 episode series.

That being said, the flash style animation still looks pretty cheap and half-assed, which is probably why many studios go down that route. "
The Magic School Bus Rides Again,Was that a Fullmetal Alchemist reference in there?
The Magic School Bus Rides Again,"Wasn't the original animation pretty bad, or at least very simple?"
The Magic School Bus Rides Again,[deleted]
The Magic School Bus Rides Again,Never found myself to into history. I would always find myself half asleep after a min during class than stay awake for more than 5 mins!
The Magic School Bus Rides Again,"Columbus still discovered the Americas for the Europeans in the 1500s. He started/inspired that whole tiny little colonization thing that I guess this guy thinks had no impact on history? 

I mean he was clearly a shitty person and an idiot, but to say he was just a footnote is ignoring that he kicked off American exploration and colonization, knowingly or not. "

The Magic School Bus Rides Again,Comments weren't kidding about that animation.  
The Magic School Bus Rides Again,"Man, I just found out Steve bought a house next to my wife's aunt and uncle and I'm so stoked to meet him one day since it's a super absurdly small ""town"" if you can even call it that."
The Magic School Bus Rides Again,Up on twitter still: https://twitter.com/netflix/status/905083345289093120
The Magic School Bus Rides Again,"Yes.  The YouTube comments were tearing them to pieces about McKinnon being in it.  It had about a thousand dislikes when I watched it, and I added another."
The Magic School Bus Rides Again,They're hinting heavily at just a torch passing cameo in the first episode.  Which is a goddamn shame because it was rumored that Tomlin had straight up offered to reprise the role entirely.
The Magic School Bus Rides Again,It's sad that a show that aired freely over twenty years ago looks better than its premium streaming reboot.
The Magic School Bus Rides Again,"Having it on Netflix makes it most likely to reach kids in classrooms. 

Back in the 1990s if a teacher wanted to show this stuff to kids they either had to find and record it onto tape off TV or spend a small fortune buying the tapes when they came out years after airing

Chances are a teacher is just going to have a Netflix log in they can use and failing that it wouldn't be much for the school to get one or two for teachers to use in classrooms 

Also, the original had pretty cheap animation. During the episode they go inside Arnold's body you can even see shots of him inside the bus, that's supposed to be inside him, because half the shots are just reused. "
The Magic School Bus Rides Again,I totally agree. Didn't even know it was Kate McKinnon either until she was credited.
The Magic School Bus Rides Again,"Ugh, minimal viable product strikes again! Damn you Silicon Valley for upending television."
The Magic School Bus Rides Again,You need to rewatch magic school bus if you think it was high grade animation. 
The Magic School Bus Rides Again,"It looks great for the target audience, which isn't childless redditors."
The Magic School Bus Rides Again,I dont think en episode focusing on gender fluidity is completely unlikely.
The Magic School Bus Rides Again,Wait do your kids actually watch the finger family videos on youtube? I figured they were some kind of scam.
The Magic School Bus Rides Again,Well it's a good thing that you aren't the target audience.  
The Magic School Bus Rides Again,I mean the original was pretty badly animated. Flash is cheap.
The Magic School Bus Rides Again,Not allowed to critique stuff. Got it.
The Magic School Bus Rides Again,"I like all the 20-30 year old Redditors getting into a hissy fit because they don't like the animation style.

It may sound difficult to believe, but not everything has to appeal to mid-twenties nerds who are nostalgic about their childhood."
The Magic School Bus Rides Again,"I actually think it's ok. Like yeah, this show isn't aimed at me, it's aimed at *Children*. As long as it continues being fun *and* educational, I think a new generation of kids and parents, will enjoy it."
The Magic School Bus Rides Again,It really isnt worse. Just a different kind of shitty.

Super Wings,"Kaley Cuoco told a good story about John Ritter on Conan's podcast.  They were on that show ""8 Simple Rules for Dating my Teenage Daughter"".  They had to do a photoshoot at Disney and John told her that after the shoot they get to ride the rides.  So they did the shoot and they were off to go ride the rides.  John stopped to sign or take a picture with every single person that asked for one.  They never got to a single ride."
Super Wings,"Luke Perry on Riverdale. His funeral episode was honestly probably the best episode of the whole show and a nice tribute to him, especially when they had Shannon Doberty (one of his costars from 90210) make a cameo appearance."
Super Wings,"Phil Hartman was murdered during the production of the 10th season of The Simpsons. His Troy McClure and Lionel Hutz characters are iconic to the show and abruptly vanished. 

I think it surprises a lot of people to learn. He died not too long before Simpsons viewership started to tank. I didn't know until years later because I stopped watching routinely a year or so later, I never noticed he was gone in the new episodes and he was ever present in all the reruns of course."
Super Wings,PETER DUEL. It's 50 years later and I still feel bad about it.
Super Wings,"Norm Macdonald died before the current season of The Orville started airing. But since it's such an effects-driven show (and his character is a CGI goo blob) he had recorded all of his lines before he passed. 

If there's a renewal (unless they rewrite a future episode), it'll be sad to see the character's death."
Super Wings,"Ward Bond, ""The Major"", during the 4th Season of Wagon Train."
Super Wings,"Ed Asner and the 300 projects he was still in when he died. Some of them still haven't been released. Before his death, I remember looking up his IMDB and seeing them all and being amazed that everyone involved was taking a chance on having a 90 year old star in the project."
Super Wings,"Will Geer, the grandfather, on ""The Waltons"" died.   Didn't help that Ellen Corby,the grandmother, had a massive stroke later on.

Freddie Prinze who played Chico on ""Chico and the Man"" killed himself.

Phil Hartman on ""News Radio"".  Burn in hell Andy Dick. \*spit\*.

As you can tell Hartman's death is the most emotional response I have to an actor's death.  The man was a comedy gold mine like Robin Williams and his death has denied us of a potential long, creative career by the man.  Beyond that, from what little I could see of his personal life, he seemed like a guy you would want to hang with."

Fun fact: that guy who comes out and pukes at the end is Ed Norris, who plays a bit part as a detective in the show but was the actual Police Commissioner of Baltimore. I think he might actually have had the job *while* acting on the The Wire for a short while, but I'm not sure."

Super Wings,Glenne Headly - Future Man
Super Wings,"15/Love was a Canadian teen show set at a tennis academy. Two of the actors died in a car crash on the way to set. I think I was 15 at the time so you kind of don't think of the characters being real people (pre social media etc.) and it hits hard when you realize. They had the characters die in a plane crash on the show.

When Alton Yelchin passed he had done voice work for a TV show and it was all released after he died. Naya Rivera was on a Step Up TV Show and her part was recast.

Edit to add: not an actor but one of the creators of Frasier died in 9/11, just before the 9th season started airing."
Super Wings,"A couple related to Muppet productions. There's Mr Hopper's actor Will Lee, who died of cancer before the show finished its first decade and had an episode dedicated to the character's passing. Also, Jim Henson himself whose death in the 90's caused numerous planned projects to fall to the wayside including a planned breakup storyline between Kermit and Miss Piggy in the 90's which would've launched numerous projects.

David as well. Played by Northern Calloway, David had to be written out of the show even before Calloway's death although it's not known whether it was voluntary or not on Calloway's part. When his declining mental and physical health led to his going on a mad rampage across Nashville in the 1980, he was only allowed to stay on the job on the condition he take his prescribed medication.

But to prevent further issues, they had David and Maria's relationship end and moved David to take over Hopper's Store when Hopper died in 1983. But things didn't last, to the point that he bit the show's music coordinator during an argument then broke into a co-star's high school to propose to her. He was fired for that and ended up in a mental hospital where he died of a exhaustive psychosis/excited delirium syndrome, literally a fatal nervous breakdown. Unlike Lee, Calloway wasn't given a tribute in the show and instead was written as having moved to live on his grandmother's farm.

And here's some fun trivia for you! Fraggle Rock had a different actor playing the lighthouse keeper depending on what country the show aired. Doc is the famous American version of the character, but there's one for the French airing at least as well as the UK airing.

Doc's counterpart in the UK version, The Captain, sadly passed away after filming the second season. As a result, he was replaced with his nephew PK (""Principal Keeper"") and BJ, the son of the lighthouse's owner."

Super Wings,"Not a real death, in the contemporary sense, but at the time, the father (James Evans Sr played by John Amos) on ""Good Times"" was killed off the show over contract/management disputes.  As a kid, I didn't know that, but James Evans Sr. was this really likable character.  His in-show death hit hard.  


It wasn't until years later, when he appeared in ""Coming to America"", that I realized he didn't really die.   


John played James Evans Sr. like a dad with a son (JJ) who was an absolute fool would really play him.  Exasperated by his shenanigans and stupidity, but still doing what he could to raise his children right.  As a kid, I really appreciated that."

Super Wings,"Jon-Erik Hexum on Cover Up. 
Check out the podcast Dark Tube- TV’s Wicked History for more on that story.
Also, Barbara Colby on Phyllis. Phyllis also had two elderly actors die on them during the show’s run."
Super Wings,"Jack Soo died of Cancer during his time in Barney Miller. They had an episode with Nick Yemana's best moments with the cast talking about him.

And while I haven't gotten that far into the series I know my heart is going to break when I reach the News radio episode when Bill is gone. I love Phil Hartman."
Super Wings,"Lennard Pearce from Only Fools and Horses died between season 3-4. They wrote his death into the show and is honestly one of the few times a comedy show went ""serious"" and it was perfect, and still funny.

Not sure if it counts also but Dermot Morgan died the day after filiming the last episode of Father Ted. It wasnt the last because he died, it was always going to be the finale but any chance of a revival or another special one off was gone."
Super Wings,"There's always something so jarring about seeing someone so young and in great shape be taken out by cancer. 

Just a remind how fragile all life can be."
Super Wings,Man i loved the first season of Spartacus so much and i had no idea he even died when i got to season 2. So much confusion and i just couldn't adjust to it so i stopped watching.
Super Wings,So sad.
Super Wings,The sad part was they did this for Andy so he could recover.  They loved the man.
Super Wings,I didn't even want to watch the sequel.  Watched 1 episode and lost interest.
Super Wings,Future episodes of Archer are just not going to be the same.
Super Wings,Woodhouse actor was one of the original NRFPTP on SNL
Super Wings,Who was her husband's character? Was it Woodhouse?
Super Wings,Peter Gregory is dead
Super Wings,"Still bummed about his death. Loved him in ""Jeremiah""."
Super Wings,And that’s how we got Woody!
Super Wings,"They had an episode about him being dead on Scrubs as well, since he played the main character’s dad in a couple episodes."
Super Wings,"I remember seeing the episode where his character died and it really hit hard. Despite not even seeing much of the show prior to that, I was in tears. A lot of people probably were. And I think now people forget how big of an event that episode really felt like with over 20 million people watching it when it aired"
Super Wings,I remember how Bridget had fought with her dad in the show and the last thing she said to him was I hate you or something like that and I know it’s a lesson everyone learns eventually but as a kid after watching that episode I would never leave the house or go to bed while fighting with my mum.
Super Wings,"I always assumed they changed the title because of how long it was and just ""8 Simple Rules"" was more... simple."
Super Wings,"Crazy how long this has survived as the most-popular answer. I was only a kid when it happened, but I remember everyone I knew being so emotional about the ordeal. He was loved by all."
Super Wings,Super Dave!!!
Super Wings,Loved that guy on Curb!
Super Wings,[deleted]
Super Wings,"All deaths suck, but hers was shitty because she was supposed to be in the final season. Because of Covid, filming was delayed and she died before they were able to film the final season. If it weren't for Covid, she'd have been in it. I know it seems small compared to her life, but I'd imagine she'd want to be apart of the show until the end that she'd given so much to.

Then because if her death, her husband Damian Lewis ended up leaving Billions early. The show is a shell of itself now."
Super Wings,Changed the rest of that show's trajectory too.
Super Wings,I love how they CGI'd her last scene just so Tony could yell at her one last time.
Super Wings,"I just wrote about that as well, but here's another fun one for you.

Did you know that Fraggle Rock had a different human cast depending on what country the show aired in? Doc is the famous American lighthouse keeper, but the UK had their own called The Captain... who sadly died after filming Season 2. They replaced him as the show's main human castmember with his nephew before replacing the nephew with the son of the lighthouse's owner."
Super Wings,Bill Moves On :'(
Super Wings,"News Radio.  :-(  

Phil Hartman was a main character in News Radio, and he was great.  The show wasn't the same after he left.  :-(  

Phil Harman's death was completely unexpected, Fturuama and Fairly Odd Parents both had characters specifically written for him that had to be recast."
Super Wings,"That was such a shock, the way he died. I still remember I was riding in my mom's car with my sister when we heard the news on the radio. We were like ""WTF!!! Turn up 
the radio mom!"""
Super Wings,RIP Selma and Flo.
Super Wings,"I feel like had Paxton in particular been alive by the time of season four, he would’ve 100% showed up during the Framework/Agents of HYDRA arc. I liked that they at least squeezed in a nod to the Framework version of John Garrett having passed away, and I thought it was really neat that they brought his actual son in to play the younger version of him for the final season."
Super Wings,You forgot Woodhouse!
Super Wings,"That was a really good episode and yes, I did cry. It helps that Luke Perry was apparently a mensch in real life."
Super Wings,"Shite, this is the first I've heard of his passing, and it was one year before covid as well."
Super Wings,He had also completed scenes for Once Upon A Time In Hollywood which was released a couple months after he died. The film is dedicated to him.
Super Wings,"The actor who Troy McClure was based on apparently was a big Simpsons fan, but didn't know they were parodying him until his daughters told him."
Super Wings,"They could just say that he left the service or got a new posting. I believe that's what they are going to do with Chekov in the next ""Star Trek"" movie."
Super Wings,What’s the best way to kill a green blob?
Super Wings,"Speaking of westerns, Dan Blocker died between seasons 13 and 14 of Bonanza."
Super Wings,Will *Geer*
Super Wings,Huh?
Super Wings,That reminded me of Lee Thompson Young-Rizzoli & Isles. Even sadder was when they had the episode where his character dies-you could see it on all their faces-they didn't have to act one bit.
After Trek,"season 2 is wrapped already, they were filming season 3"
After Trek,"PROTECT PATRICK STEWART. (Who I know is vaxxed and boosted and has been outspoken about that, but still.)"
After Trek,Maybe they can use this time off to write a decent script
After Trek,Red Alert! Keep the captain and the crew safe.
After Trek,"50? Thats a huge number, ive worked on shows that didnt even have 50 total production crew members."
After Trek,Somebody must have sneezed on the pile of cocaine in the writers room
After Trek,If Patrick Stewart dies of covid while working on this trash show I’m gonna be really sad
After Trek,"national teasure Sir Patrick needs to survive, no matter the cost"
After Trek,Just came to here to say I’m so grateful to find dozens of other Trekkers that think Disco & Pic suck. Because I’ve been digitally-shouted down so many times I try and criticize the writing and stories on these shows.
After Trek,Please let Patrick Stewart be safe.
After Trek,They should just stop filming altogether. This show is god awful!
After Trek,"I hope everyone on set is alright (most importantly sir Patrick Stewart), everyone except Alex Kurtsman that is."
After Trek,Even God tried to stop Stewart from embarrassing himself MORE
After Trek,"Insert ""no one hates Star Trek more than Star Trek fans"", ""mom's basement"", ""single"", ""clinging to the past"" and other argument-terminating clichés used by people who can't grasp that others don't like this show simply because it's a dumpster-fire."
After Trek,The 17 people still watching must be devistated.
After Trek,i mean can you just cancel this abortion of a show? Or fire Alex Kurtzman for fuck sake.
After Trek,Those 50 Covid tests are the only positive things about Picard.
After Trek,People continue to think that Covid is over when it never left.
After Trek,They should've shut it down at 0 positive tests.
After Trek,As long as the Orville is still coming. That's the best Star Trek since DS9
After Trek,activate the EMH
After Trek,"Dreadful show anyway, that executive producer fuck needs to be ripped from control."
After Trek,What the fuck
After Trek,"We know Stewart is now an android that is also exactly like regular non-android Patrick Stewart, so is he susceptible to covid or not??????????"
After Trek,"This series was such a disappointment to me, was hoping for essentially TNG 2 but this series is dog water, and they Patrick Stewart and Jean Luc dirty I hate it"
After Trek,I honestly do not know anyone who is watching this but I hope that Sir Patrick Stewart is fine.
After Trek,I bet this will be happening at most TV / movie sets this winter. So much for new TV eps later on this year.
After Trek,Good! Let's hope they cancel this dogshit series
After Trek,Is anyone watching that trash fire?
After Trek,"Unmitigated disaster.

And it sucks that so many crew members got COVID."
After Trek,If you losers kill Patrick Stewart producing a tv show no one was even watching then you are the worst humans alive
After Trek,Good! It’s not even real Star Trek! Fuck that shit show
After Trek,"Well once they are clear, they should be good to go!"
After Trek,"Well, that's what happens when everyone does a 1725."
After Trek,At least more seasons means more RLM content
After Trek,KEEP PATRICK STEWART SAFE!
After Trek,So that's where Whoopi got covid.
After Trek,"Its ok though, androids can't get covid."
After Trek,Spend two years being careful only to throw protections aside to hang with friends and family over holidays.  Not worth it.  Only positive is having vaccines so it helps not having to be put on ventilator.  All those poor soles in beginning that had to go through that horror and died slow painful death.  Made progress yet patience was tossed aside and now everyone is getting it.
After Trek,Here’s to hoping it never resumes production
After Trek,Sounds like they need Robert Picardo or Gates McFadden to do a cameo.
After Trek,"I'm guessing this is still filming for season 2, or are they doing S3 now?"
After Trek,Who the fook doegnt protect themselves?
After Trek,Must have been one hell of an orgy.
After Trek,"Big deal.  Vax has been out for a year.

Move on."
After Trek,"Okay, after the shit show that was December 31, we need to bubble wrap and protect Patrick Stewart."
After Trek,Too bad COVID couldn't have ended this travesty altogether
After Trek,"I’m not sure why people seem to dislike this show.

I’m a huge TNG fan and really enjoy it. Granted I’m married with a kid so maybe I need to be single and living in my parent’s basement to be this angry at a fucking TV show."
After Trek,I can’t even name 50 jobs on a film set.
After Trek,"it'll be missed, moving on..."
After Trek,Imagine how terrible it would be if Star Trek Picard killed off Picard.
After Trek,Bro what if Patrick Stewart dies of COVID 😭
After Trek,Tested positive. So???
After Trek," Loved the first season, even if some didn’t. I hope that Patrick Stewart is keeping himself safe! The world needs that man."
After Trek,oh no please dont shut this show down it's great television really it's just the best I cant get enough
After Trek,Said it once I’ll say it a thousand times until we get our COVID orgy guidelines straight things like this are gonna.keep.happening
After Trek,[title] “sources say” [title with more words]
After Trek,After Season 1 I was hooked. The originality the fx etc etc then I read the tired old sad season 2 was a pathetic rehash of some tired old crap I was crestfallen lets hope season 3 is better I'm not going to bother with 2
After Trek,We have gone here before.
After Trek,Oh well. I don’t watch much TV anyway.
After Trek,Hope all are ok
After Trek,"No Paramount+ where I am now so if it gets taken off Amazon Prime, it'll be easy to forget about just like when Discovery got taken off Netflix? Losing Lower Decks will be unfortunate though."
After Trek,I thought this show had been insta-added because of awful writing
After Trek,Is anyone watching this?
After Trek,Can't they just get holograms to do everything?
After Trek,This is why our studio doesn’t test
After Trek,The Paramount+ user interface is so bad I quit after one day.
After Trek,"i didnt even know they planned a season 2, i liked season 1 mostly so cant wait."
After Trek,"Which is the last season, if Stewart is still serious about what he said before the show started. He wanted a three-season story and then that would be that."
After Trek,That's  Sir Patrick Stewart
After Trek,"We already lost Betty White, we can't lose him as well."
After Trek,"Better cancel Star Trek Picard entirely, just to be safe..."
After Trek,"even with the booster- people can still die (just highly unlikely), and if you’re as old as patrick is… it may not help sadly."
After Trek,Don’t worry I think his new cyborg body isn’t affected by COVID
After Trek,Maybe covid will cause damage in the part of kutzmans brain that makes him suck and he'll emerge a great man.
After Trek,I lost any hope in modern trek years ago.  I hate jumping on bandwagons like this but the current trek regime really is a joke.
After Trek,https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=lMHAZwR-BdQ
After Trek,"There’s always a hologram, android or some other entity that will turn out to be unaffected and saves the day."
After Trek,"eh, hollywood's averaging 20-50 cases per show since Monday. Media mostly stopped caring about it."
After Trek,[deleted]
After Trek,"On a small show a couple of days ago, we lost the Executive Producer, a Audio A1, the Engineer in Charge, and several others on the day of the shoot. This is after taking PCR tests last week, and rapids the day before on set-up day. The engineer ended up hanging out nearby in his car, in case of emergency. Nobody had symptoms."
After Trek,I think if they were on cocaine they'd write it to be a bit more fun.
After Trek,Writers are traditionally cut-off from everyone else. Tis a lonely job.
After Trek,😂😂😂
After Trek,They already written a way to keep him alive beyond 100 in-universe so they might find a way IRL
After Trek,Yes but he needs to retire.
After Trek,r/murderedbywords
After Trek,What if Covid were the friends we got too close to on the way?
After Trek,What people are saying is we need to accept it's around forever and not focus on cases but hospitalizations & deaths for vaccinated people. Unless those start spiking hard or vaccines are no longer severely lowering the chances of severe symptoms then people need to stop freaking out.
After Trek,When will people accept that it is never going away?
After Trek,"The film industry doesn’t really believe this though, they have more rigorous protocols and testing probably more than any industry outside of the health industry. They are very aware that covid isn’t over and shutting down production completely is a sign of this. Don’t think other industries would even do something like this. Now you can argue that the entertainment industry is non essential, but that’s a bit of a different discussion. If you really want to blame someone blame the 100 million people in America that refuse to get vaccinated and let these variants mutate and spread."
After Trek,"I think people just stopped giving a shit about Covid, because they noticed it will never leave. Naturally this goes mostly to the people, who tried to keep the masks on, got their shots on time and stayed away from bars/nightclubs/big groups of people and then saw... that well it helped nothing. 

Way too many people are stupid selfish cunts, so the people who cared are losing their hope/will to give a shit too.

And I'll never understand why nurses who don't believe in the shots, are keeping their jobs. Not believing in shots means they don't believe in modern medicine in general. That should mean that they are not fucking able to take care of anyone, because they'll just go ""but this is big pharma medicine and the lizard people in facebook told me it's bad so... i'm gonna give you this green tea instead""."
After Trek,So true. Season 1 was the worst Star Trek ever on top of them butchering the character of Picard totally. I haven't watched the current Discovery session (and didn't finish the last) but even the first two session of that show were far better besides being clearly on the weaker side of ST shows.
After Trek,Nothing good can come out of season2. Much less season 3
After Trek,"They might all have covid now, but their show gave everyone cancer a long time ago."
After Trek,Yeah shut up Wesley
After Trek,[deleted]
After Trek,Agreed. The Orville is a fantastic trek
After Trek,That show deserved/deserves better. It's so good but the production has been a mess and I'm afraid it's lost it's momentum and people have moved on.
After Trek,"I'm assuming they're filming it in Ontario where they also film Discovery and Omicron is like a gazillion cases a day. It's virtually everywhere.

EDIT: Nope it's filmed in California. Sorry my dudes"
Star Trek: Discovery,"Just keep SNW and Lower Decks going and I'll be happy.  

I'm glad they're allowing them to do some additional filming to wrap up the series and S5 clearly wasn't the planned ending."
Star Trek: Discovery,SNW is gonna be the tent pole Trek show it seems. LETS GO!!!
Star Trek: Discovery,"From three live action Trek show to just the one. Taylor Sheridan is the new cash cow IP that Paramount is betting their future on. 

Be interesting to see if they get a new live action Trek show ready to go for 2025 or if they just cannot afford it and plan to milk just one series and the Trek library and think that will be enough."
Star Trek: Discovery,"The protagonist in this show always confused me.

They got a really strong actress to play her, but so much of the writing for the character seemed like it was coming from some really awful fan fiction."
Star Trek: Discovery,"Discovery is my least favorite of the franchise.  I'm a trekie, was really excited for the show, and really wanted to like it.  But I just could get into any of the characters or the plots."
Star Trek: Discovery,"It’s a mercy killing.

Thank goodness we won’t have to watch Michael Burnham crying again."
Star Trek: Discovery,"The show's had its ups and downs. S1 and S2 had a lot of great moments and I liked that they tried some different things, even if they didn't always land. S3 & S4 are less offensive (for lack of a better term) to Trek sensibilities but I found the show's gotten really boring. I hope we can have an exciting fifth season.

I wonder where the franchise goes after Picard and this are over. There's hundreds of years they can fill in now, tons of characters they can spinoff or use elsewhere. Hopefully they make good of it and take the right lessons from the less successful shows from this era of Trek."
Star Trek: Discovery,TIL there are 5 seasons of Star Trek discovery.
Star Trek: Discovery,"For me, season four is tied with Picard season two for the worst Trek season ever."
Star Trek: Discovery,Therapy cancelled.
Star Trek: Discovery,"Only one more season of ""mysterious threat"" while Michael cries about it to go!"
Star Trek: Discovery,"I can't believe this got 5 seasons.  The first season was bad, but Jason Isaacs carried it a bit.  The second season was dreadful - I couldn't finish it - so either it had a dramatic swing in quality or people just watch anything with star trek on it"
Star Trek: Discovery,I remember when it was supposed to be an anthology series.
Star Trek: Discovery,Haven't watched since S2. Glad they're not spending money on it anymore. I'll sign up to watch SNW and Lower Decks.  If they do a 7-of-9 leading Titan show I'd watch that for a bit...  Unsure the current show runners can be trusted with any new shows though.
Star Trek: Discovery,I’m so angry this lasted longer than enterprise
Star Trek: Discovery,Good riddance
Star Trek: Discovery,"It's the worst one, out of all the newer Star Trek shows. Smart move, canceling."
Star Trek: Discovery,"I wonder what dumb, inane, melodramatic thing will be the center point of season 5?

Will Michaels tears heal a plague or something?"
Star Trek: Discovery,Thank fuck.
Star Trek: Discovery,The Pike character was the best thing to come out of this series.. once he was gone it felt like some CW melodrama.
Star Trek: Discovery,"Im... surprised they got that many seasons. Wow. I like Star Trek so I watched the first season and a bit of the second before deciding it was just too fucking cringe to possibly watch anymore.


Kudos to the trekkies that made it this far I guess."
Star Trek: Discovery,Maybe giving the space ship emotions meant they ran out of plot ideas
Star Trek: Discovery,This is good news. Discovery has become terrible and SNW is great. I feared that SNW would be sacrificed for Burnham.
Star Trek: Discovery,I can't believe that travesty got past season 2.
Star Trek: Discovery,"Good. Discovery failed because every season it was about something else.  So even though it had lots of good ideas, no one idea could could ever gain it’s footing and flourish. 

And then of course there was all the whining about people’s feelings."
Star Trek: Discovery,Of all the ST series that I have watched over the last 50 years … STD was by far the biggest disappointment. It will not be missed by me.
Star Trek: Discovery,"Thank god. Both atrocities (Picard and Discovery) ending. Keep Strange New Worlds and Lower Decks. 

Its too bad theyre committed to this terrible reboot universe or whatever the F it is since theyre still going forward with a Section 31 show i assume. The one thing that should be kept a mystery."
Star Trek: Discovery,"Keep Prodigy and Lower Decks. Give me Captain Harry Kim. Please, I beg of you."
Star Trek: Discovery,"The cast and crew are great. 

The acting is great. 

The SFX are great. 

But the writing is anything but. 

Their explanation for what causes The Burn in Season 3 was dreadful. Like I get the angle that Discovery is trying to take but *that* was the best they could come up with?"
Star Trek: Discovery,are they fucking crying in the thumbnail too?!
Star Trek: Discovery,"I watched a whole season of this shit without learning what any of the characters' names are, or why I should care about them. ""Because they're on Star Trek"" isn't a good enough reason.

Michael is the main lady, every episode is written around her saving the galaxy by herself again. There's captain Orca, there's Michelle Yeoh, there's the skinny guy. There's the gay guy, and his boyfriend the other gay guy. The redhead is the ""like OMG I'm just so awkward"" character, and there's another whole lady who has robot things on her face. Michael had a boyfriend who was a Klingon in disguise. At some point they added possibly the most boring comedian out there to add... humor? to the show.

I knew more about the crew of the Enterprise after the first episode of Next Generation than I did after a whole season of Discovery."
Star Trek: Discovery,Am I the only one who thought this show was subpar bordering on hard to watch compared to literally every other Star Trek show ever? Or is something wrong w/me?
Star Trek: Discovery,Good. This one was never very good.
Star Trek: Discovery,How many seasons can they save the entire galaxy every single time? Could have been better.
Star Trek: Discovery,That trash show should have stopped after season 2.
Star Trek: Discovery,Can anyone who still watches tell me if Michael still cries in every episode
Star Trek: Discovery,I cant believe this shitshow managed to stay afloat for 5 seasons.
Star Trek: Discovery,Whew! The Amoxicillin finally kicked in. Took long enough. Don't how much more of that burnham sensation I could stand to take.
Star Trek: Discovery,"Although I love Trek shows, I'm glad. I'm tired of Burnham crying in every episode over stupid stakes. As long as Strange New Worlds sticks around, I'm happy."
Star Trek: Discovery,"I just want 10years after Voyager... see what happened in the galaxy post the dominion wars.

It be nice to have an old school 20 season show as well... every single episode doesn't have to have the fate of the universe... 

since Voyager we've had. Enterprise (prequel) Kirk reboot films (prequel) DIsco (prequel) SNW (prequel) and then Picard which was what 30 years into the future, but solely focus's on picard... not so much about the state of things"
Star Trek: Discovery,"I honestly can't believe this got past S1. The worst trek by far.

Hopefully prodigy survives."
Star Trek: Discovery,"Thank god, fuck this show."
Star Trek: Discovery,Paramount bet big on the creator of multiple dead on arrival franchises.
Star Trek: Discovery,Good riddance!
Star Trek: Discovery,A truly awful show
Star Trek: Discovery,Oh thank god it’s finally over
Star Trek: Discovery,How to fuck did it get too five seasons.
Star Trek: Discovery,Season 4 **WAS SO BAD**
Star Trek: Discovery,Good riddance
Star Trek: Discovery,"I really think that Star Trek needs a minor reset.  They need to make Discovery's future an alternate timeline and advance with the Picard universe.  I am not saying that Picard seasons 1 and 2 were awesome, but you can build off that universe and have some older TNG, DS9, and Voy characters as stars and connect with old Trek fandom, but not worry about the Discovery dilithium disaster."
Star Trek: Discovery,"give strange new worlds at least as many seasons as this trash was given. lierally the best part of discovery was pike on season 2 as a supporting character, he was so good they built an entire series around him. nothing on discovery works."
Star Trek: Discovery,"try to watch it, but it was just too bad. RIP"
Star Trek: Discovery,Frankly this show is probably twice as expensive as SNW but gets less viewers so I'm not surprised. I'm not sure there will be 3 live action shows a year again but they're gonna have more than just SNW. Maybe Seven gets a command (Titan maybe)
Star Trek: Discovery,Fantastic news.
Star Trek: Discovery,It should have ended with season 1
Star Trek: Discovery,"Too much crying for gods sake. Even the thumbnail!


 I still enjoyed S1 a lot though. 
The dillitium plot line was bonkers. .."
Star Trek: Discovery,Thank god.
Star Trek: Discovery,"I haven’t hated Discovery, but I’m not disappointed with this.

Keep Lower Decks, Prodigy, and Strange New Worlds and I’m happy."
Star Trek: Discovery,"Discovery just never found its footing.  It's sad that I've watched 4 seasons, and theres 3 people on the bridge that I cannot remember their names."
Star Trek: Discovery,"Good, it was not good...."
Star Trek: Discovery,"I don't hate Discovery, but several of the seasons have been really coasting on auto pilot....not terrible, but not particularly interesting.

Michael Burnham is an insufferably Mary Sue character.  She NEVER does what she's told, always makes decisions WAY above her pay grade, and she always turns out to be right.  

to say it gets old is an understatement"
Star Trek: Discovery,"I’m a trekker from when I can remember, this is the WORST series ever of Star Trek. It’s just not Star Trek in a Star Trek studios."
Star Trek: Discovery,"Yup. Called it. They were stupid to give this POS a second season after the first bombed spectacularly, let alone four more. You can forget about those Section 31 and Starfleet Academy spin-offs too because Paramount has finally figured out no one GAF about Kurtzman Trek."
Star Trek: Discovery,They need to develop a series about Rachel Garrett and the adventures of the USS Enterprise NCC-1701C.
Star Trek: Discovery,The best Star Trek show is currently The Orville. Hate to say it.
Star Trek: Discovery,Should have been cancelled 5 seasons earlier
Star Trek: Discovery,I really wanted to like this show but they tried so hard to imitate the JJ Abrams Trek movies and failed miserably. it was so glaringly obvious.
Star Trek: Discovery,"I have enjoyed Discovery for the most part, even if most of the internet hates it. It's definitely got it's flaws, I do find Michael a pretty frustrating main character, but it was nice to see them try something different with the Star Trek formula. There were some decent ideas in there, and I do personally prefer the more serialised format, but they didn't really seem to know where they were going with it once they got to >!the future.!<

I did enjoy Strange New Worlds more, but personally I don't like the ""planet-of-the week"" style from old Star Treks as much as an ongoing story arc. I know a lot of people would prefer that all Star Trek sticks to that formula, and SNW vs Discovery does imply that it works. But I think that it's more down to the characters and the writing where one succeeds and the other fails, rather than it entirely being down to the format.

It's a shame to see Star Trek seemingly winding down a bit again, going from 3 shows and a bunch in the pipeline to just 1. It did feel like they might end up oversaturating things a bit with more shows, so it's probably for the best. We'll see if the Section 31 show or anything else pops up to take it's place, but if we just get more Strange New Worlds on a regular basis for a few more seasons, that's fine too. 

Hopefully they can learn from what worked and didn't work in this era of Star Trek shows, and come out with something new. I'd love to see something that continues on the timeline from where Picard finishes off, rather than more prequels, distant futures, and alternate timelines. Perhaps Picard's ending will lead into that, or Discovery will find it's way back to the ""present"" day."
Star Trek: Discovery,[deleted]
Star Trek: Discovery,Im suprised that shitshow managed to last that long.
Star Trek: Discovery,Not much else they can do for Michael other than making her God. Don't know where else she can fail up to at this point.
Star Trek: Discovery,This shit isn't Star Trek
Star Trek: Discovery,Burn it and forget it ever happened. Maybe bring Saru into another series but the rest of the story + cast...try to make it all a dream or something.
Star Trek: Discovery,Yep and I'll never watch it because I refuse to subscribe to yet another streaming service.
Star Trek: Discovery,Lost its mojo after season 1. Terrible writing.
Star Trek: Discovery,"I figure that they’re looking at doing some type of continuation of Picard in some form or another and realized there’s not enough in the budget to do that and continue Discovery, a show that has had tepid audience acclaim at best. 

Picard Season 3, Strange New Worlds, Prodigy and Lower Decks have had mass acclaim, so they probably figure money is better spent on those projects."
Star Trek: Discovery,Thank you
Star Trek: Discovery,There is a god after all.
Star Trek: Discovery,Thank god! Will finally be able to take this off the list of shows I have to watch but hate! Hot mess of a show!
Star Trek: Discovery,"about  2 -1/2 seasons in , you could tell they were out of good writing / ideas.... it went downhill from there.

SNW is far superior , for now."
Star Trek: Discovery,"Id love to know what the money men reasons for keeping this show alive for 5 seasons was.      

This was the most expensive tv show ever made per episode at release."
Star Trek: Discovery,"I should have *loved* this show. Instead, I never once connected with it."
Star Trek: Discovery,5 seasons too many
Star Trek: Discovery,"I'm a ST fan, but I couldn't become a fan of The Michael Burnham Show. That is not Star Trek."
Star Trek: Discovery,Thank god. Fuck that show man. I watched the first two seasons and that was 1 1/2 too many.
Star Trek: Discovery,"I stuck through it till the end of season 3. While it did have a lot of good things, I felt the bad things far outweighed them. It was nice to look at, I enjoyed almost all of the characters, Burnham going through the different time periods in that suit was cool, I liked the idea of the spore drive and theres probably alot more I could think of if I really tried. However, the bad stuff like, changing the Klingons - why change something that wasn't broken, Burnham's constant crying and breaking the rules and not making any fucking sense half the time and so many more things. The straw that broke the camels back for me was after Burnham prevented Stamets from attempting to save his husband, she had the audacity and ignorance to not understand why he was deeply hurt from what she did. Sure, it all worked out but how fucking dense could they make a character. It would have made way more sense if she said ""sorry, I did what I had to"" or something along those lines but to be surprised and upset by Stamets reaction was just too much for me. Fuck what a dumb character."
Star Trek: Discovery,Thank god
Star Trek: Discovery,Good riddance.
Star Trek: Discovery,I appreciate that it directly lead to the current wave of shows.
Star Trek: Discovery,"I am NOT against diversity and all that at all. But in Discovery it was so badly and over the top implemented i could not continue to watch it.

A five minute unnecessary monolog about removing a ’pimple’ (penis?) of that transgender character was too much and unnecessary. All main cast was power  women while men were weak and clumsy sidekicks.

At the other hand i guess that showcased what TV has looked like from womens perspective in the past. A dated approach nevertheless."
Star Trek: Discovery,That show was awful. Should have just named in Star Trek : Michael Burnham Saves Everyone Yet Again.
Star Trek: Discovery,Good riddance. Dire acting and writing!
Star Trek: Discovery,"Oh no, now do we have to talk about our feelings every freaking decision a bridge officer makes?"
Star Trek: Discovery,Thank god for that. Even knowing it exists at all makes my life a tiny bit worse.
Star Trek: Discovery,"4 seasons too late. Should’ve been canceled after the first season. Im hoping all of these nutrek shows just die so they can give the keys to someone who actually cares about trek, like Seth McFarlane. The Orville is the only good trek show on and I’d know he’d respect it if he got to make trek"
Star Trek: Discovery,"Thank you, it was time for Discovery to die. The only good thing we got from it was SNW."
Star Trek: Discovery,Honestly surprised it got a season 2
Star Trek: Discovery,I haven’t watched it and it sounds like I’ve saved time. Is it true they don’t respect the chain of command in this series?
Star Trek: Discovery,"lol thank the gods. How did it even get to season five. They wasted a lot of supporting talent like good cg, sound, costume, makeup etc on a show with bad cast, bad acting, generally poor prospects. Captain michael was never gonna happen, show runners. You morons still tried to force it happen. And it sucked biiiiig time. 

I loved many things in discovery. Specially good high quality cg and sound and set + modernized look for many alien races. LOts of thought and effort went into these things and I appreciate it a lot thanks."
Star Trek: Discovery,"Discovery not being renewed? Can I get a hallelujah?!! let’s get the Kleenex ready for Michael! Honestly it was so painful to watch. It’s the only Star Trek I’ve not finished, it’s just too painful to watch all the tears, allllllll the time! And some of the characters, deaf god!"
The Exorcist,I forgot about this show. I remember now that I liked it when Genna Davis was around but not so much after that. This franchise has a lot of ups and downs and from what I can recall I'd say this series was somewhere in the middle. Below Exorcist 3 but above all the other sequels.
The Exorcist,"Poor writing maybe, lol. Despite its flaws I was disappointed that this one was cancelled. I think it could have evolved into a good show, maybe with guest writers/directors. I think I read somewhere that there’s another film/remake/reimagining/re-memberberry in the offing, or being made or something."
The Exorcist,"I really loved this show, had it premiered today I think it would've been bigger."
The Exorcist,"“Why does the people who are possesed who meet father Marcus just not kill him? He obviously is a threath with all his knowledge.”

The show really wasn’t well designed. I thought the idea of the rich people wanting to be possessed was interesting but it should have been the focus of the show. It was developing an interesting mythology in that aspect. But a lot of the other stuff like the Reagan rehash didn’t work."
The Exorcist,"> I remember now that I liked it when Genna Davis was around but not so much after that. 



Geena. Yes same here. She was in the first season. I stopped watching after that."
The Exorcist,"I really was pleasantly surprised, it left a hole been thinking about this show on and off like an ex-lover who took my heart lol."
The Exorcist,"I love it.

I’d never heard of it during it’s original run, but watched it on Amazon and thought it was fantastic. I definitely enjoyed the first season more than the second, but that’s not a knock on S2, which was just as fun.

I just loved how it kept the connection to the original movie."
The Exorcist,"Not great, not terrible"
The Exorcist,"It was fantastic!

Right up there with *Hannibal*."
The Exorcist,"I watched it from when it premiered.  This show was so good.  Season 1 was better than 2, but I still enjoyed both.  I was so upset when they cancelled it."
The Exorcist,"I liked it a lot honestly, you should probably check out Evil."
The Exorcist,"I loved it, was really fung watching week to week and discussing the show."
The Exorcist,That scene with the millipede is the most visceral horror I’ve ever seen on television.
The Exorcist,"Not a big horror fan,but I remember watching it back when it came out,and it was ok.

But I liked **Apparitions** more,it's a miniseries,pretty similar to the exorcist."
The Exorcist,I thought it was great!
The Exorcist,"Yes it was good, I don't know why it wasn't renewed, not enough people watching, or mainstream tv afraid of offending people and losing advertising $$."
The Exorcist,"I loved it! too bad shows nowadays aren't allowed to have a sophomore season slump.
They should have gotten the chance to wrap the story up"
The Exorcist,Meh. It's no Haunting of Hill House.
The Exorcist,Nah. It had potential. I thought the idea of rich assholes actually wanting to be possessed to be interesting.  But the show seemed to have nothing in common with Blatty’s books outside the shoehorning of Regan into the thing. And the second season was just boring.
The Exorcist,"I liked it for the most part. Got a little too goofy for me, but thought the two lead priests were great together"
The Exorcist,"I really liked the first season

I think it'd been cancelled by the time I got around to watching the second season so I never saw it"
The Exorcist,"the first season was great, the second took too long for the reveal and was kinda boring if i remember correctly, it's sad it was cancelled though"
The Exorcist,I love Ben Daniels!!! He’s just superb here in this show.
The Exorcist,3.6?😉
The Exorcist,"I got bored of ""Haunting of Hill House"" really quick. /shrug"
The Exorcist,"Yes! I watched it on Netflix and really enjoyed series. It definitely worth watching. Good characters, and some scary moments. It’s also nice that even though it was cancelled early,  the main plot of each season wraps up well, it’s only the B plot that has no resolution."
The Exorcist,"You know it's crazy, I remember watching this, and I remember enjoying it, but now I honestly couldn't tell you one thing about this series. Neither the premise, plot or characters... I can't recall a thing about it. 

So it was good, but in hindsight... forgettable?"
The Exorcist,"Right up there with *Hannibal* on NBC.

What both these shows did right was they didn't attempt to make a generally appealing ""network show"" whatsoever. They made a horror program for the genre's audience. It's doomed to be niche, sure, but at least they took the risk."
The Exorcist,John Cho did SUCH a great job on this show! I wish it had kept going
The Exorcist,"I was watching the first episode, then all of a sudden I heard a baby crying on the side of my house which is next to the alley. Its really dark with no lights out, so I took a flashlight outside and went to the side of the house. It was two cats making love on my fence. It freaked me out. I threw a lemon at them from my tree and decide I'm not going to watch the series."
The Exorcist,I loved this show! It was one of the shows I looked forward to watching each week. Still mad it got cancelled.
The Exorcist,"I ended up watching this on Amazon a couple of years ago and found it to be the best Exorcist related movie/show, aside from the original movie.

I thought Season 1 was a little better than Season 2 if only because it had that past history to go off of and season 2 I thought started a bit slow, but picked up steam brilliantly. It’s a shame it was cancelled."
The Exorcist,"Fun fact, my friend played Stacy in season 2.

We used to work at Cineplex together, and now we individually work in film."
The Exorcist,"> better that it had right to be

Don't do this."
The Exorcist,Why didn't it have any right being good?
The Exorcist,Wish shows like these were more accessible to watch once done airing!
The Exorcist,"Such a great horror series. It had a great plot and storyline, great acting, the only thing it was missing was the audience. I was super bummed that they cancelled it."
The Exorcist,"YES!!! Completely underrated, exceptional show. One of the ones I’m most sad isn’t continuing. I loved it!"
The Exorcist,"agreed, shame it was canceled"
The Exorcist,"Damn, I just finished the two seasons in less than a week and I'm really heartbroken, that it won't continue! It had everything in place to become a great third season"
The Exorcist,"What is it with Reddit posts like this? Like you could post this garbage for anything, like I just thought of a random shitty franchise and I thought of the Beethoven series. I could post “The ‘Beethoven’ series was way better than it had any right to be. Even the direct-to-video sequels weren’t excellent, especially for family entertainment.” and I’d probably get at least a few dozen upvotes. 

The second movie with Gary Busey was great. The third one with Don Swayze really made me think and by the time it was over I had forgotten that Patrick Swayze was a human being who existed on this earth, his performance was so mesmerizing. It’s right up there with The Godfather series in terms of earth-shattering works of popular entertainment."
The Exorcist,"I'd seen this opinion shared a number of times and it eventually got me to watch the first season.

My overriding feeling was that it shared little with the film and got progressively sillier as it went on. I did finish the whole season though so it's certainly not bad.

I felt the twist, or perhaps reveal is a better word, to tie it in with the film was poorly written and unnecessary. The series also carried none of the weight of the film and lacked the introspection to discuss a topic such as faith, or the losing of it.

I'd be interested to know whether it originally started out as a tie-in or whether the studio realised attaching The Exorcist name to it was a useful way to gain more publicity. Fair play to them, it was certainly a factor in getting me to watch.

The positives for me were Herrera and Daniels were charismatic leads, most of the effects work was good, the Brother Simon character was enjoyably villainous, and the way they personified the demon, along with the actor portraying it, was quite creepy.

I'd be wary of recommending it to people as anything other than a decent horror series, particularly if they're big fans of the film."
The Exorcist,Nah
The Exorcist,It was a terrible show what are you talking about
The Exorcist,I watch the first episode time to time for the end scene.
The Exorcist,I agree with you as far as the first season goes.
The Exorcist,"That particular plot twist/reveal in season 1 was pretty god damn insane and bold, took me completely by surprise. It was a very good series, sadly we never got a decent closure. The Exorcist tv series is like a worst idea ever, but this was actually surprisingly good."
The Exorcist,I only remember the priests gaining powers and it was funny watching them fight
The Exorcist,"The first season was really great. The second season started off really great, and then became really generic post-twist."
The Exorcist,Watch Evil on Paramount+.  I think it's vastly superior.  Season two is darker now that it went streaming only.  Just renewed for a third season!
The Exorcist,So it is worth watching now?
The Exorcist,I really loved the priest characters (the veteran one who was kind of on the outs with the church) and the new-to-this-stuff rookie. The whole plot and way it all connected to the church was really interesting. I enjoyed that the two seasons were different stories/settings and I remember great performances from Geena Davis in the first season and in season two John Cho and Brianna Hildebrand were great.  Really enjoyed the series but I also forgot about a handful of things and was just reminded of them when thinking about the show.
The Exorcist,I just had the exact same reaction when i read this post.  I think I was obsessed with it but I'm gonna have to watch a trailer and maybe do a re-watch if it's warranted.
The Exorcist,This is an inspiring story.
The Exorcist,But you need to use a pretentious headline to grab peoples attention!
The Exorcist,Because I guess that makes for a more interesting headline?
The Exorcist,"This franchise has a reputation for being run into the ground. Until this show, nothing had come even close to matching the quality of the original."
The Exorcist,Because most of the sequels sucked except the one that was basically a completely different story that used a few of the same characters and settings
The Exorcist,Both seasons are on Hulu in the U.S.
The Exorcist,"Well, I'm someone who saw this post and had never heard of this series and now it's on my watch list.

You're on a public forum where people talk about television.  You should probably get used to it, or unsubscribe."
The Exorcist,"Yes. It's an open-ended, ""and then they kept fighting evil"" kinda thing."
The Exorcist,I would rather qualify it as obnoxious.
The Exorcist,Well said.
The Exorcist,"Okay thank you, I will give it a try."
The Exorcist,Of course they are more complex. Most are like a 100+ hour long movie
The Exorcist,There are tons of character driven films released every year. Not everything is a superhero move/blockbuster hopeful. There's also tons of trash on TV. It's unfair to compare the best TV shows with all movies released.
The Exorcist,"If you like Friedkin's work, and haven't seen it, do yourself a favor and find a copy of Sorcerer and watch it. It's insanely awesome. "
The Exorcist,"In other news, the sky remains a blue-ish color scientists are hesitantly calling ""blue"", and rain still falls downward. "
The Exorcist,"Preliminary PR work, since he might be involved with True Detective season 2 :)"
The Exorcist,"ITT: People who don't know who William Friedkin is. 

This story isn't notable because he's breaking the news that TV shows are more complex, it's notable because one of the greatest and most prolific living film directors is saying that television is a more thriving art form than film these days and considering working in the medium. That's big fucking news. I'm on pins and needles imagining what Friedkin would bring to a cable drama."
The Exorcist,Killer Joe is fucking intense if you haven't seen it yet
The Exorcist,"I think that the anti big four network stigma is what is hurting the show Hannibal on NBC.  It is incredibly acted, great writing, great directing, continues to get great revues, but still cannot get an audience because people that watch these kinds of shows are paranoid that a big network cannot maintain artistic integrity."
The Exorcist,I don't watch superhero movies for intelligence or complexity.
The Exorcist,"With hope, he'll direct all of True Detective season 2."
The Exorcist,"I respect his opinion, but I generally disagree with it. There are plenty of movies that get released every year that ""make you think"". There's also plenty of shitty TV that gets released every year. Why does everything have to be deep and complex? I enjoyed True Detective and Breaking Bad for the most part, but I also like American Dad and Robot Chicken. I don't watch those for the same reasons, nor do I want to. It's the same thing with something like Prisoners and The Avengers.

I think my biggest problem is that his quotes sound really condescending to anyone that likes what he calls ""opium for the eyes"" as if they're brainwashed and he's sophisticated enough to resist it."
The Exorcist,Why does he single out superhero films? There are only like 4 or 5 of them every year. That's nothing. Why does he not go after the shittons of insipid romantic comedies that come out every year in the dozens?
The Exorcist,Superhero films that target child audiences. 
The Exorcist,Weirdly enough I'm going to a Texas chainsaw massacre screening/q&a that he's moderating ( he apparently mentored tobe hooper).
The Exorcist,"Amazing! 

Television dramas that are 5 times longer and character-driven turn out to be ""deeper and more complex"" than superhero movies?? I'm shocked, SHOCKED! I tell you!

I also love the generalization that TV is all about these cable dramas (that I myself love) - **90% of what's on the rest of cable & network television is also dreck.** Not that everything that's showing up at your local cinemas is *""guys flying around with Spandex suit and a cape and a mask""* either. 

This interview was done in the Czech Republic, perhaps Billy spent all of his time in Europe last year and missed ***Gravity,*** ***Dallas Buyers Club***, ***12 Years A Slave***, ***Nebraska***, ***American Hustle***, ***Spring Breakers,*** ***Prisoners*** - not a cape to be found in any of them (although I guess ***American Hustle*** does have a lot of spandex...).

Let's not forget that the same year Joss Whedon did ***Avengers*** he also made one of the best modern adaptions of Shakespeare with ***Much Ado About Nothing.***"
The Exorcist,"
""Television today is better than cinema; it's deeper and more complex and it is for adults,""    
There are plenty of deep and complex movies and there are plenty of shitty tv shows.   



You cant even compare adult drama series with superhero action movies.      

If superhero movies dont have complexity and adult drama then should i criticize Cable dramas shows for not having ""guys flying around with Spandex suit and a cape and a mask, solving crime everywhere""?"
The Exorcist,"I disagree with the super hero films. As long as I can remember I have wanted to see my comic book hero's in action. The thing is, it's only recently that the tech was available to make it believable. So we'll have a glut of them for awhile and then move on.........."
The Exorcist,[deleted]
The Exorcist,Why single out superhero movies though? There are some pretty damn good superhero movies being made. 
The Exorcist,Breaking Bad is deeper and more complex than the Avengers? I'm shocked.
The Exorcist,"kk now lets compare apples to oranges. I am pretty sure movie dramas like Primer, Donnie Darko and Fight Club are just as deep and complex as cable counter parts. "
The Exorcist,"I take umbrage in comparing the ""smart"" dramas on TV to superhero movies. Both have completely different (but somewhat overlapping) audiences. Most people don't go into a superhero movie expecting to get intellectually stimulated; likewise most people don't go into a drama expecting green monsters and explosions.  

Personally, I prefer the television as a storytelling medium over the movies. There's more plot and character development to be had. "
The Exorcist,"Yeah, we know."
The Exorcist,Stop patting yourselves on the back for liking something. It doesn't make you a better person.
The Exorcist,"I praise those kind of dramas too, I have to be quick because they tend to get cancelled due to lack of ratings pretty quickly!

The moment studios figure out how to turn real housewives into a movie format, even Michael Bay movies may seem too highbrow to survive!"
The Exorcist,"Good content that isn't created by committee to satisfy the safest, widest swath of people and there-by taking zero risk and end up being as satiating as popcorn is better than the other option? shocking news."
The Exorcist,"Yeah, because, if they pass with the audiences, they have time to develop and grow into something amazing."
The Exorcist,"Which is how it should be. You cannot expect a 1-4 hour experience to come close to duplicating the depth and intricacy of a series. Many American series can have 30+ hours in a single season. It is impossible to duplicate that in a theatre. Being said, I do love a nice cerebral movie, but popcorn flicks have their place, as well."
The Exorcist,"I find it interesting that Friedkin mentions that he wants to work in television as if he has never worked for the small screen.  He actually directed an episode of the Twilight Zone (85 version) called ""Nightcrawlers"".  It was probably the darkest, most violent and visceral TW episode ever made."
The Exorcist,Why diss super heroes? There are stupid and smart TV and movies. 
The Exorcist,The Exorcist Steps deserve their own movie
The Exorcist,"Yep I'd agree. Watching season 6 of the sopranos again, best series made IMHO."
The Exorcist,"Hollywood has become obsessed with blockbusters and potential franchises. Not many big mainstream movies are made for adult audiences anymore. So of course people would turn to tv. And it doesn't hurt that we've had fantastic shows like Breaking Bad, Game of Thrones, Mad Men and more to pick up the slack. "
The Exorcist,"You mean it's possible to tell a better story over a whole tv season vs. just a few hours in the theater?

Who would have thought such a thing could happen??!!"
The Exorcist,"it's not like blockbusters were particularly smart before they started making superhero blockbusters, they've always been big action movies. if they weren't making them about superheroes they'd make them about something else...like Transformers."
The Exorcist,"Just about all of television is pandering ass bullshit full of cliches.

I can't watch most shows without immediately having my intelligence insulted with a constant barrage of overused themes."

Lethal Weapon,"Mac started playing Riggs in blackface, but mid-film Dennis took over the part without makeup because it was increasingly offensive, even to him. This made the whole thing kind of hard to follow. Additionally, Frank insisted on casting himself in a full-penetration porn scene in exchnge for financing the effort."
Lethal Weapon,the guy who was playing riggs got fired for his onset behavior the show was so close on not getting a third season because of all that
Lethal Weapon,"Lots of problems going on behind the scenes. Not sure who to believe, or what to believe. All I know is if theirs no Riggs, Lethal Weapon cannot exist because he IS the Leathal Weapon.
That’s why I don’t want any more movies, or a reboot. Mel Gibson nailed it, and in 4 movies he went from a widowed veteran with mental struggles to a family man, and realizing he cannot do what he did when he was young. The show was a fun peak into the characters in todays world. That’s enough for me."
Lethal Weapon,Guy who played Riggs was a prick to work with.
Lethal Weapon,Not to mention all the implications on set.
Lethal Weapon,You could pick the the dvd at your local library until last year-  it was pulled!
Lethal Weapon,There is a bit more problems on set according to the actor https://youtu.be/u908kIaj12U
Lethal Weapon,"Clayne Crawford explains what really happened on Lethal Weapon set](https://youtu.be/u908kIaj12U)
There is actually an interesting  podcast that actor who played Riggs did after being fired. He explained how the other actor, Damon Wayans, was actually not showing up to set according to him. Mistreating some of the writers, crew, etc. He said he would have to help rewrite pages a day before shooting, just to cater to him and he wouldn't get writing credit. Then when he complained they backed up Wayans, because he is more of a household name. 

Then one day when Wayons didn't want to a do even a small amount of stunt work(just striding into a building with a prop gun,  because he got injured once on set. Riggs actor, Craford, said he then confronted Damon by his trailer and someone filmed it. He said people on set thanked him for standing up to him, but then when the executives fired him, they did not back him up. There was also a leak where he yelled at someone while directing, but he said that context was a guest actor was really working hard on an intense scene, but loud noises kept happening in the background and no one on set was taking care of the issue. Crawfor stated that he felt bad for the guest actor. 

All in all not sure who's in the right, but given the way he explains it and seeing his amazing performance in the show Rectify, I think he is just a passionate artist who worked on a very chaotic and factory like produced TV show."
Lethal Weapon,No! No ones in danger… but the implications.
Lethal Weapon,So you're saying they are in danger?
Lethal Weapon,If you believe Riggs I have a bridge to sell you.
Lethal Weapon,"sell me it, i need a view."
Lethal Weapon,"If you believe ANY side. Both sides want to make it out that they were right. It’s what everyone does. I guarantee both are leaving out important details. 

I wouldn’t be surprised if both him and Wayans were difficult to work with and the network chose to keep the bigger name."
Lethal Weapon,"Yeah I suppose you are right, but he makes a convincing case I do highly recommend watching the podcast. It is his word against his, but it seems he is exposing a lot."
Lethal Weapon,"Damon had back problems throughout the shoot, and his schedule was always lighter, even from the pilot. Clayne is and was an extremely talented actor, but is and was a diva and not friendly to work with. Making an action TV show on a network schedule is extremely difficult already, and throwing in that type of personality doesn’t help anybody. There were enough on set instances in this new era of not tolerating bullshit behavior that he had to go. Doesn’t matter he said/he said, it’s as simple as that."
Lethal Weapon,"I can understand. But I thought I heard Damon was the diva, despite the back issues according to other producers on the show. I may be wrong though."
Lethal Weapon,I don’t think either of them were peaches! But I did hear about a lot of berating of crew members by Clayne that created a poor workplace environment.
Lethal Weapon,"Superman, The Goonies, and Lethal Weapon. This guy made up a good chunk of my childhood."
Lethal Weapon,"RIP 

Such an eclectic director who somehow also had his own unique style. He left his mark in the history of film and we’re all lucky to have his fantastic work."
Lethal Weapon,"He directed a few *Twilight Zone* episodes, including one of my favorites (*Nightmare at 20,000 Feet*). 

May he rest in peace."
Lethal Weapon,"He achieved so much but ill always be most grateful for The Goonies. It's my desert island film, I must have seen it hundreds of times and it never gets old to me.

That opening chase sequence is one of the greatest cinematic openings of all time (for me at least). It perfectly sets the scene for what is to come and I'm even humming the theme out whilst typing this, its so ingrained in my memory.

I know The Goonies was a massive collaborative effort (Columbus, Donner and Spielberg) but his influence and stamp on that film is undeniable.
If I could visit one cinema location, it would be Astoria, Oregon. Purely because of this film! Hopefully one day I'll make it out there.

RIP Richard, you'll live on through your work and I can't wait to one day show The Goonies to my kid."
Lethal Weapon,Check out Superman 2: Donner Cut if you haven't already - basically this whole Snydercut thing happened before with Superman
Lethal Weapon,"Ladyhawke is still one of my favorite films, RIP Mr Donner"
Lethal Weapon,RIP to a legend. At least he had a long and an impressive life.
Lethal Weapon,"Legend. RIP.   

I know he was trying to get Lethal Weapon 5 made, as a final goodbye to the franchise with a story he said was very personal yo him and the actors. Curious to see what happens to that now."
Lethal Weapon,"That sucks, didn't they just announce Lethal Weapon 5"
Lethal Weapon,Obligatory “Goonies never say die!” Post. You will be missed.
Lethal Weapon,Great career and filmography. Heard he still wanted to make a new Lethal Weapon film.
Lethal Weapon,Still my favorite Superman movies.
Lethal Weapon,[deleted]
Lethal Weapon,RIP. With Verisimilitude.
Lethal Weapon,"He directed some of my favorite Twilight Zone episodes, including The Jeopardy Room and Come Wander with Me. RIP Richard."
Lethal Weapon,"I saw most of his filmography before and during the pandemic; and, my God, his films were hugely entertaining and he worked with the best of the industry (actors, cinematographers, producers, etc.). It's truly a shame he died, he was a fantastic blockbuster director. May he rest in peace."
Lethal Weapon,"The studio really dicked him over on the Superman movies. Despite the Studio and the moronic Salkind brothers, Donner made 2 great Superman films."
Lethal Weapon,"That guy always knew how to party. Because, ain’t no party like a Donner party."
Lethal Weapon,"RIP. 

Knew a friend who referred to directors as “Don [Last Name]” as a term of respect. I guess he took it from The Sopranos or mafia movies. He’d say “Don Tarantino”, “Don Burton” etc. Always stood out when he said “Don Donner”. He was a big Superman fan"
Lethal Weapon,RIP I'll always remember him for lethal weapon 4/5
Lethal Weapon,"Deepest condolences to friends and family, absolute legend 🙏🏻❤️"
Lethal Weapon,Not only was he an awesome director he was a great story teller. He has great interviews on The Business and Gilbert Gottfried's podcasts. The interviews are worth seeking out. His wife was/is a big time producer too.
Lethal Weapon,Goonies never say die
Lethal Weapon,Riiiiiiiiigggsss
Lethal Weapon,I love cheesey cop movies. The Lethal Weapon series is my favorite of all time. I can watch any one of them any time of the day. Rip bud.
Lethal Weapon,"Fuck, man. I was just doing tourist stuff in Astoria today and we visited the goonies house. RIP."
Lethal Weapon,RIP to a legend.  So many of his films marked my youth as I was growing up.  He shaped how I saw and expected movies to be.  He will be greatly missed.
Lethal Weapon,"Lethal Weapon ……always on,always good."
Lethal Weapon,"RIP. Made some great films. Heard he was trying to get another Lethal film with the original cast off the ground. Guess it never got going. A shame, but it is what it is."
Lethal Weapon,Wow just watched The Omen earlier today.  A bit creepy...
Lethal Weapon,"What a great run he had, though. Some of my favorite childhood movies and TV shows came from this man. He had a way of injecting just enough cheesiness into certain projects to make them more fun than they had any business being. '*Maverick*' is a perfect example. Based on a 1950s-60s western TV show, I don't think anyone else could have sold the idea of a movie adaptation to studios 30+ years later, much less made it as great as he did. From the [Danny Glover cameo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwyfEgOv0vU) giving a hilarious nod to '*Lethal Weapon*', to basically [every scene with Graham Greene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_nYT8WhFjk), that movie would have been a cornball failure in anyone else's hands. 

Thanks for the memories, Richard. You will be missed."
Lethal Weapon,A great [story](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/goonies-invaded-richard-donners-hawaii-getaway-1292063/amp/) about the man and the Goonies cast. Will be missed.
Lethal Weapon,"This is one of his best scenes imo.  Reeves was born to play Superman, and was a fine actor, but Donner brought something extra out of him.  When he says 'I never lie'… you believe it.

[Superman Meets Lois Lane](https://youtu.be/4KTwdr5aTT4)"
Lethal Weapon,I can’t believe he died!   So many projects he did.  Rip :(
Lethal Weapon,The last of the Donner family.
Lethal Weapon,Nice
Lethal Weapon,Hollywood is trash
Lethal Weapon,Taken before his time😞. God has another little angel by his side now👼
Lethal Weapon,now well never get lethal weapon 6
Lethal Weapon,This man understood movies/audiences in the 1980's.  Genius.
Lethal Weapon,Rando. I just watched Goonies yesterday and wondered what he’d been up to.
Lethal Weapon,I've never seen The Goonies or Lethal Weapon but Superman was my shit.
Lethal Weapon,RIP
Lethal Weapon,RIP
Lethal Weapon,"A big fan of the first 2 Lethal Weapons, Goonies, and Scrooged. RIP."
Lethal Weapon,Sad
Lethal Weapon,I will donate my half cents to him.
Lethal Weapon,"The director commentaries he did are fantastic. My favorite movie commentary is for Superman, and his on Superman II Richard Donner cut and The Goonies are great as well."
Lethal Weapon,"Damn, those are some classics. Goonies will always be special to me. RIP."
Lethal Weapon,Wasn’t he making Lethal Weapon 5?
Lethal Weapon,What an awesome life he had. Lethal Weapon was a movie I watched over and over and over again as a kid. He made something that gave a super anxious kid great comfort. I always have respect and gratitude for people who have effected my life. He lives on for millions through his work. Can’t ask for much more than that.
Lethal Weapon,I didn’t even know he was sick
Lethal Weapon,\*Is 91
Lethal Weapon,RIP
Lethal Weapon,He was involved big with Tales From The Crypt as well and directed one of my favorite episodes. Incredible artist.
Lethal Weapon,Rest in peace
Lethal Weapon,😢
Lethal Weapon,Damn
Lethal Weapon,Danger Island.
Lethal Weapon,"I know this will come across as egotisticla , but my enw hosuemates don't get a apper l;ike my rpevious one, and I'm still not in the habit of watching TV news. I msised this news, Gavin McLeod some w eeks ago, Charley Pride l;ast December (and him I almost got to meet at FanFair '99 except for a schedule conflict.)"
Lethal Weapon,Let’s no forget his other great contribution! The Kabab named after him!!
Lethal Weapon,Also my favorite Christmas movie: Scrooged.
Lethal Weapon,he also did _The Omen_
Lethal Weapon,"Apparently a chunk of my parents' childhood as well, seeing how many episodes he directed of the shows they use to watch:

*The Rifleman, Wagon Train, The Wild Wild West, The Man From UNCLE, Combat, The Bananna-Splits, Wanted Dead or Alive, Gilligan's Island, The Fugitive* and *Have Gun - Will Travel*"
Lethal Weapon,He was also an executive producer on Tales from the Crypt and directed a few episodes
Lethal Weapon,Excellent TZ episode!
Lethal Weapon,From Agnes - with Love was also a great one!
Lethal Weapon,"I believe he also directed Come Wander With Me, which is my personal favorite TZ episode."
Lethal Weapon,"I recorded that movie off of HBO and I watched it every single day when I got home from school for over a year, until the VHS tape wore out. I was surprised to learn as an adult that lots of other kids did the same thing."
Lethal Weapon,"Have only seen it once in  a theater where the volume was too high to enjoy. My favorite actress (well, former actress) said a major influence for her was when she asked to see \*Ghoulies\* and her parents took her to \*Goonies\* instead."
Lethal Weapon,"Man, I forgot that was Donner.  What an incredibly eclectic career.

The soundtrack to Ladyhawke was certainly... of its time.  The rest of it holds up pretty well, other than Matthew Broderick's accent."
Lethal Weapon,*The Gang Makes Lethal Weapon 5 For Real*
Lethal Weapon,"I wonder if such a thing would be even possible, though.  Glover's mad old, and we all know of Mel Gibson's trials and tribulations.  I really doubt WB would front the cash.  I'm happy with the two really good, and the two so-so movies, that we ended up getting.  The series was pretty good too, up until Chace Crawford got fired."
Lethal Weapon,Yeah but Mac did blackface and the critics were not happy.
Lethal Weapon,M y   sister really yelped when the guy (DAvid WArner?)  w as decapitated by the glass. and w e were all a dults.
Lethal Weapon,Suddenly I’m hungry and I don’t know why.
Lethal Weapon,So he just referred to Don Siegel by his regular name?
Lethal Weapon,Don’t forget big Jerry Bruckheimer’s pal Don Simpson ;)
Lethal Weapon,They don’t come cheesier than those.
Lethal Weapon,He made that? Awesome
Lethal Weapon,"Ive literally never heard of this movie, looked it up, definitely have to watch.  I love Charles Dickens, A Christmas Tale.

Edit:its been a long damn wknd and it should be carol."
Lethal Weapon,Great film. Extremely well put together.
Neo Yokio,"That was such a great anime, why not make more? I was so frustrated when it ended…"
Neo Yokio,"Good idea, I forgot to watch it last year. It definitely deserves to be in the yearly rotation."
Neo Yokio,I LOVED NEO YOKIO
Neo Yokio,"Haven't watched the Christmas special yet, but we seem to be in the minority of loving Neo Yokio. People seem convinced it's not satire and is just bad writing, but even if the later is true, watching it as satire makes it incredibly enjoyable and hilarious. I can see the comparison to FLCL. Though I think FLCL is way more out there and straight forward about being satire. NY is pretty dry in its presentation of it. Either way, I'm looking forward to watching the special! Thanks for reminding me it exists!"
Neo Yokio,"FLCL is completely fucking insane and NY is more absurdist. As weird as it is to say NY is a lot more grounded and less of an acid trip than Fooly Cooly. There’s nothing like FLCL, it’s just batshit and amazing. NY is more of a smirkfest at itself. 

I still really enjoy NY, but one is a masterpiece and the other is super fun. I do find it surprising that NY is less well received just because it’s way more... normal than Fooly Cooly while still being fun and snarky af. "
Neo Yokio,I too likeNeo Yokio. Show got lots of undeserved hate bc hating the Smith family is popular among douchebags critics and their herds.
Neo Yokio,"> Either way, I'm looking forward to watching the special! Thanks for reminding me it exists!

No Prob - check out r/neoyokio if you want to discuss the show more. "
Neo Yokio,"I feel like the Christmas Special pretty much confirms the tone is intentional. It feels like the show is finally winking at you and saying ""Don't worry, we know!"" Can't wait for season 2!"
Neo Yokio,You probably wear navy blue like a disgusting West Side plebe
Neo Yokio,"How can there be any doubt is the question. People must lack all critical thinking skills. I guess that's why popular comedies bash you over the head with the lame jokes, because the masses take things literally. I guess it happens all the time in certain subreddits as well. 

I'm not claiming to me some great interpreter I just don't see how people don't get that this show is that style of humour, seems obvious (mars bars, underwater houses etc come on already). "
Neo Yokio,*midnight blue
Neo Yokio,"To be fair, you have to have a very big toblerone to understand Neo Yokio. The humour is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of fashion most of the jokes will go over a typical viewers head. There's also Kaz's nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation- his personal philosophy draws heavily from Jaden Smith's literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the wokeness to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realise that they're not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Neo Yokio truly ARE hikikomori- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the Wokeness in Kaz's existential catchphrase ""We'll all be equal in the grave"" which itself is a cryptic reference to Jaden Smith's Twitter. I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Ezra Koenig's genius wit unfolds itself on their television screens. What fools.. how I pity them. 😂 And yes, by the way, i DO have a Neo Yokio toblerone that is very big. And no, you cannot see it. It's for the ladies' eyes only- and even then they have to demonstrate that they're within 5 Rankings in the bachelor leaderboard of my own beforehand. Nothin personnel home slice 😎"
Neo Yokio,"This show got a lot of negative response but imo it was pretty damn funny, some fun satire"
Neo Yokio,But is there gonna be a second season?
Neo Yokio,"This is the show I always see on Netflix and mistake the character in the thumbnail for Lil Uzi Vert, right down to the art style used on a couple of his albums/mixtapes."
Neo Yokio,This news deserves a big Toblerone
Neo Yokio,"I'm just happy to be getting more of this show, even if it is just a Christmas special. It was my favorite anime of last year against all odds. Just hope that we can get another season in the future. "
Neo Yokio,"Cool. I hope Neo Yokio can improve on the first season. I enjoyed S1 for what it was, but it could definitely be better."
Neo Yokio,This series is quite...interesting. One hell of a voice cast.
Neo Yokio,Jaden Smith: the animu is getting more episodes while I'm here still waiting for new seven deadly sins.
Neo Yokio,ok so i was high when i 1st saw this and made this theory but u notice how the announcement video glitches at the end. p scary huh? well maybe its a hint that the christmas special is a ruse and they'll drop a halloween special this month idk
Neo Yokio,"I bet all of the people hate-watching this had Netflix impressed with the ratings. ""Look at how many people are watching this, they must be hungry for more."""
Neo Yokio,"Gee, I don’t know Kaz. "
Neo Yokio,I read this whole fucking thing before I knew what you were doing. 
Neo Yokio,[deleted]
Neo Yokio,[deleted]
Neo Yokio,"I haven’t seen it so I can’t judge, but could it be that it’s just bad and people are saying it’s a satire to believe it’s better than it is? "
Neo Yokio,that's the real question
Neo Yokio,If Netflix cancels this show then they don't deserve this big Toblerone!
Neo Yokio,"FYI, they're not being serious. It's a sarcastic copypasta based on an original sarcastic defense of Rick & Morty."
Neo Yokio,A video review on it summed it up beautifully: It's an Abridged series for a show that only exists in Jaden Smith's mind.
Neo Yokio,"I actually thought the first episode was horrible the first time I saw it, but once I saw the second/third episode I realized that it was satire. When I watched it again with my girlfriend I found the first two episodes were like a brand new show for me. Super impressed with this anime"
Neo Yokio,"Yeah, I found it really odd that so many people missed what it was a biting satire of. "
Neo Yokio,"it's very clearly a satire; in fact, that's underselling it, as there are multiple independent levels of satire at play. it's genuinely a case of too clever for its own good though as it seems to have simultaneously sailed over and under the heads of both audiences and the critical community. like, it's inconceivable that [this sequence](http://disconcision.com/post/166360257619/ep-2-in-this-scene-damien-hirsts-for-the-love) could occur in a 'so dumb it's dumb' show.

please note that this is *not* an argument that the show is good (imo it's incredible, though slightly uneven), just that it's misunderstood, mostly due to the unusual mix of high- and low-culture signifiers; anime surface style, star-studded cast, fashion and art references, etc etc etc - coupled with the extreme dryness of the humor."
Neo Yokio,"You really do have to see it to understand. Not saying that to sound pretentious, but there's a camp that firmly believe it sucks because it's ""not anime, actually!"
Neo Yokio,I want to live in his head.
Neo Yokio,[deleted]
Neo Yokio,"The show infuriates me much less now, thank you. I couldn't understand the praise for a show where basically nothing happens and it doesn't execute on its saitirical ideas. I kept getting so lost in Jayden being Jayden just for the sake of being ultra pseudo-deep, that when the show didn't work any consequences or stakes into the plot it just didn't feel like satire. But if theres a more complete version in Jayden's head..."
Neo Yokio,[deleted]
Neo Yokio,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8XAI9FJai8
Neo Yokio,It’s written by the lead singer of Vampire Weekend. That says just about everything that you need to know. 
Neo Yokio,"Hm, could this be *The Room* of anime then? I certainly found it funny, but I could easily believe the creators didn't intend it to be. Though there are moments that are hard to miss as being pretty absurd and comedic, like the robot butler reveal and such. "
Neo Yokio,"wow. this is exactly [what i was talking about downthread](https://www.reddit.com/r/television/comments/9mrdg4/neo_yokio_teases_christmas_special_for_december_7/e7hfat1/). like, I'm glad guy enjoyed it but he really, REALLY missed the plot.

the first mistake is thinking of it as an anime. basically every moment the video spent on comparative animeology - which was most of it - was spent wandering further afield. aside from a couple brief nods to specific series (as mentioned in the video), neo yokio really isn't very anime at all. it uses the anime surface style - especially incumbent aspects such as the casual transatlantic blending of western cultures - as a distancing device intended mostly to highlight the absurdities intrinsic in its object-level narrative.

which brings me to the second mistake; i'm no jaden-smith expert, but AFAIK the show, and the character Kaz, have no relation whatsoever to jadens dadaesque twitter account. Kaz is not deep, faux- or otherwise. he, like the titular city in question, is obsessed with branding and surface signifiers. in a phrase, Neo Yokio is about the coming-of-age of east-coast millennial scions and their internal  collisions between writ-large luxury consumerism and burgeoning feelings of social responsibility. 

... which brings me to mistake three - 'product placement' - it actually boggles my mind that the reviewer apparently assumes that coco chanel or louis vuitton paid for product placement on a netflix show. identifying these inclusions as a cash grab shows either a detachment from reality, or, more likely, a complete lack of familiarity with the culturally milieu which created this show. I mean, at least these got a mention; absent is awareness of the fashion and art references from rick owens to damien hirst.

and speaking of those - ironically, if you wanted a japanese angle on this a better point of reference then the anime name-dropping would be murakami and the superflat movement, in particular the collapsing distinction between commercial and fine art. the race through the guggenheim, besides being hilarious, seems clearly intended to evoke that for this cultural class, there is no difference except scale between fifth-avenue branding and supposedly legitimated 'cultural treasures'; just an undifferentiated spectrum of status symbols and value stores.

at the risk of repeating myself, i don't think that anything above is really reading-in; [it's (1)](http://disconcision.com/post/166309113284/sooooo-neo-yokio-cmon-tumblr-im-not-on-the) [all (2)](http://disconcision.com/post/166360257619/ep-2-in-this-scene-damien-hirsts-for-the-love) on [the tin (3)](http://disconcision.com/post/166367377239/ibid-so-neo-yokio-joins-brian-lee-omalley-and).

and again, I don't even mean to come down on the guy for not seeing any of that... there's certainly a lot of absurdist lol random humor in there as well. i'm happy he liked it and I think it speaks to the show's quality that you can enjoy it while misunderstanding basically the entire core of its construction.

Neo Yokio,"No, I mean the band’s lyrics are frequently about the trappings of East Coast luxury with heavy doses of wink wink nudge nudge comedy. Neo Yokio is very much the sort of thing Ezra would write. Sorry, there’s a similar thread on /r/indieheads and I forgot where I was. "
Neo Yokio,I think their denial is satire in itself. The show is brilliant. 
Neo Yokio,"""Write a 1000 word essay on the graceful geometry of cable knit sweaters""
10/10, best anime writing ever"
Neo Yokio,Is that Richard Ayoade as the store clerk?
Neo Yokio,"Watched the whole series, and I liked it. Some episodes are funnier than others but overall it felt like a stupid show fully aware of its own stupidity and playing it up for laughs. Don't watch this if you're looking for something anime-like: visually, it's anime but the tropes it follows are almost exclusively Western. 

The absurdity of the plot and the characters' motivations make up most of the humour in the show. I don't really mind Jaden here, because you're not really supposed to like Kaz: he's a superficial, kinda condescending asshole who's self-absorbed and can't really understand any perspectives other than his own. To that end, Jaden's almost extraterrestrial voice acting sort of works: he sounds about as detached as Kaz acts. If you're looking for a deep character study, this ain't the show for you, but if you just want to crack up and laugh at something stupid, Kaz works.

MVP is easily Kid Mero as Lexy, he kills practically all his lines lmao."
Neo Yokio,I really like Lil Uzi Verts debut into acting.
Neo Yokio,"Neo Yokio is great at what it's *supposed* to be.

It's not a parody of anime, it's a thesis on joke dubs, like [Ghost Stories](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SxJ4VWoeOzs). The entire point of the show is to seem as much like a joke dub of an existing anime as possible, despite not ever actually being a real anime. It's a really niche fandom to make an entire show catered to, but for what it's supposed to be, it's perfect."
Neo Yokio,"Finished all 6 episodes.

Starts with lady crotch shot... lol. 

So, it's some affluent/aristocratic/fame-obsessed society with magical family exorcists. It's a very weird, eccentric slice of life about fashion, rich people, being trendy, competing bachelors, popularity contests, media obsession, etc. with the occasional demonic threat. She broke up with me, he's a more eligible bachelor, she likes him, she doesn't like him, that's not a hip perfume, fabric knowledge, clothing brands, etiquette, celebrity, pop stars, parties, extravagant dinners... it's not something I'd normally watch. There isn't really any plot or character development.

Jaden's voice acting is pretty sub-par. Sometimes it feels OK, but most of the time it's very emotionless and wooden. Most of the voice acting seems off, actually, as if they couldn't see what their characters were doing on screen. 

I can't tell if it's actually aware of itself or not, either way it doesn't come off as well-executed. I mean, sometimes it's pretty obvious that it's making fun of unaware high-society snobs, but then you take a step back and realize they are including jokes that those types of people would laugh at. It'd be like making someone watch a shitty soap opera as commentary on relationships. You might find the absurdity and actually laugh at occasionally, but you're still sitting through hours of a shitty soap opera. This is probably more tolerable for disaster-piece lovers. 

Lines/premises like ""old money fuck boys"", caprese martinis, ""Charles, put some pep in your step"", the cursed pool, ""What's up, city bitch?"", big Toblerones, etc. are kinda funny but few and far between. The ""joke"" lasts too long and if you're not in on it from the beginning, then it will come off as nonsensical and dull. Neo Yokio can't seem to decide between being weak social commentary, selective genre/medium parody, or a teen comedy and, instead, it mostly fails to do all 3. 

I don't think I like any of the characters, especially the protagonist. It feels like they were designed for/by upper-class 15yo twitter users. Lexy is fun, tho.

The production value, art, and animation are fine, I guess.

It ends the same way it begins + an Akira reference.

Neo Yokio,"good grief, everything out of his mouth sounds like one of his twitter updates. "
Neo Yokio,So is Jaden as bad in this as I'm expecting
Neo Yokio,"Watching this as a serious anime, it’s garbage.

Watching this as a self-aware, ironic anime? It’s fucking amazing."
Neo Yokio,"I honestly really enjoyed it. It's awful in a lot of ways, but also kind of great too. You'll laugh at how bad it is but you'll also laugh because some of it is actually really funny. Hoping for a season 2."
Neo Yokio,"The Brand is Strong Ball Bags!!!

Ok seriously I've watched the first episode and oh man it's bad. But! I'm not watching it for it to be good. I like the actors and it's to be watched for being silly. 

Seriously there's like 20 anime shows released a year that are pretty decent to watch, go watch those if you want the real. 

If you are in your late twenties early thirties think of it as some weird shit you found on adult swim at 2 in the morning. "
Neo Yokio,"I couldn't stop laughing at this, all points of it I had a smile.

10/10 please watch, its cringtastic. "
Neo Yokio,"I'm finding it hilarious.

Japanese parody anime: ""They're geniuses!""

Westerners parody anime: ""Ugh, do they have any idea what they're doing?! This is ridiculous!!""

Yes, this parody show is ridiculous. Parodies often tend towards the ridiculous."
Neo Yokio,"Good god Ezra, why?? "
Neo Yokio,"So is this some kind of ""Rich Kid Satire5""? I get some strong American Vandal vibes from this show. And by the way, it's fucking hilarious"
Neo Yokio,[So here's the Anime News Network Review](http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/review/neo-yokio/.121543)
Neo Yokio,"I'm half way through the second episode. 

Get drunk. This thing is ridiculous. I have no idea if this is intended to be funny, but good God I am enjoying it with a few drinks in me."
Neo Yokio,"This show is really confusing. I think I like it because it's good, but I also might like it because it's bad. I do like it though."
Neo Yokio,"Show title should be ""Rejected Vampire Weekend Lyrics"""
Neo Yokio,"It was a fun first episode, so far. I love the blatantly unrelatable main character disguised as relatable. Once you assume that it's self-aware and just attempting to make the worst mash-up of story-telling tropes, you'll learn to enjoy the shit that it does. "
Neo Yokio,its bad and even ayoade knows it
Neo Yokio,">Jude Law as Charles

I want to die"
Neo Yokio,LOVED IT
Neo Yokio,"Fuck it, I'm entertained. Jaden isn't that good a voice actor, but I'm not that interested in Kaz, either."
Neo Yokio,The trailer made it look funny
Neo Yokio,Its so bad that its good. Its horrible but dam is it amusing. I want to think its satirical and self-aware but fuck it I don't care. Voice acting sucks. Script is terrible. Animation is well done. After the first 15 minutes you find yourself wondering what the fuck am I watching? But you just keep going and don't know why. Overall good time killer and entertaining.
Neo Yokio,"The show is not good, bordering on very bad. The 2 main issues are that the story is underdeveloped and the main character is unlikeable. Kaz's main traits are that he's good at everything, popular(to his dismay), tragically hip and overly angsty. His conflicts are never substantial or the classic uphill battle that gets you to identify with and/or like him because he's introduced with the preconceived notion that you like him and want to see his adventures so the story doesn't develop him more. I don't have any bias towards Jaden Smith but his performance is monotone and bland, but lucky for him all the voice acting is bad for some reason and the audio in most scenes have an amateurs-ish feel to them with a weird silence that makes it feel cheap(maybe because of the score or lack of). Things I think could fix the series are better side characters, they aren't memorable or they could use some over the top features and personalities like in JoJo or FLCL, but what the show needs most is better/more expansive plots(although it finds its footing past ep. 3 and it starts feeling like an actual TV show). Shows like Archer and Boondocks do so much more in the same runtime as this but these episodes feel like they do nothing and go nowhere, even if they kept the same plots adding better gags and dialogue would make it more interesting. Highlights are Lexy & Gottlieb, they almost always have the best lines and that's about it. I like Kaz's character design but the animation is mediocre even by American ""anime"" or action cartoon standards nothing like the Avatar shows or Young Justice. Minor issues are that the creator/writer wears their interests on their sleeve leading to lots of references to art, fashion, Japan culture and giant toblerones. No amount of Jason Schwartzman or Richard Ayoade can fix the various problems, all together I give Neo Yokio a rating of: Not Dank.


Also the last line of the season is an Akira reference [""Neo Yokio is about to explode.""](https://youtu.be/-UhLderbuGI?t=35s) Kinda Dank."
Neo Yokio,"Just watched the first episode. This is the first ever anime I've watched, so I've got nothing to compare it to. But for what it's worth I enjoyed it.

If I had any criticism, it would be Jaden Smith's voice over work. 

Slightly off topic, but are there any anime fans out there who can recommend a series for a newbie?"
Neo Yokio,"The voice acting here is extremely terrible from every single character from what I seen except for maybe Aunt Agatha. Seriously each line sounds like complete crap, I've seen better VO work better done on abridges series on Youtube. Animation is great..but that's the ONLY saving grace this series has to offer. "
Neo Yokio,Somebody tell Jaden he sucks
Neo Yokio,Jaden should really study up to be an accountant or a producer or something. Acting just isn't for him.
Neo Yokio,Alexa Chung !! I'm sold 
Neo Yokio,this show is terrible!
Neo Yokio,Jaden Smith needs to commit a major crime and end up in prison for life.
Neo Yokio,It's so Ezra Koenig
Neo Yokio,"It must have been.

I also liked the ""I love sports!"" coming from him at the end of the first episode. It sounded very Moss from the I.T. Crowd."
Neo Yokio,Yes.
Neo Yokio,"They also spell it out in big bold letters in the final episode that kaz has been blind to the real struggles in his city.

I'm seeing a ridiculous amount of hate for what I think was a pretty interesting little show. 

Why do I suspect it's a knee jerk reaction to the fact that it's a western animation and jaden Smith worked on it?"
Neo Yokio,"It's not aware of it's own stupidity. It's creator, Ezra Koenig, is very serious about the subject matter, and seems to believe the show is actually ""deep"" or ""meaningful,"" even going so far as to compare the main character to Bruce Wayne. It's a pointless story, with terrible voice acting, pacing, and can pretty much be summarized as ""A Jaden Smith tweet with visuals."""
Neo Yokio,"I noticed that too! ""Okay, so they decided to make the very first beat an upskirt shot. Anime parody?"" Either way, questionable from the beginning."
Neo Yokio,"HOLY SHIT I WORKED ON THIS AND NO IDEA IT WAS COMING OUT. 

Originally this show was supposed to be for Fox's ADHD and then FX, which was overseen by one of the main guys from Adult Swim. 

It was very self-aware from the beginning, but the idea was to make something very straightforwardly an anime, but absurd in the set up. It was supposed to be serious when it came to the references to fashion and such. 

The way it was pitched to Jaden, I expected it to be a lot more melodramatic in Jaden's performance (like he was supposed to take everything super seriously like JoJo characters yelling Nani?). My guess is that Jaden can't actually act so it doesn't come across. 

Terms like Gentlemen of Leisure and Bacherlor board were like Hokage etc. like very serious titles. 

I was there when they brought in Jaden, and they mentioned wanting Desus and Mero for the best friend characters. This was supposed to be made right around the height of Jaden memeing, but obviously it took them a long time to get done. 

I did track it after ADHD completely folded and I thought it just never got actually made. "
Neo Yokio,"It's definitely self-aware, if nothing else. Ezra Koenig, the guy who created it, recently described it as ""[a light drama about Italian food](https://twitter.com/arzE/status/908010288380702720)."" "
Neo Yokio,"I think its pretty obviously self-aware, most of the people criticizing it seem be to completely missing the humour of the show"
Neo Yokio,"I watched through the whole season. What token gay couple are you talking about? I didn't see any gay couple at all. And what do you mean by forced diversity?

Edit: I forgot about the high school music teacher but they don't show his boyfriend at all."
Neo Yokio,Forced diversity in modern media? How do you mean? like some characters are black in this show but it's in a new York type place. It would be weird if there weren't black people 
Neo Yokio,"> The over-the-top dialogue, the ridiculously bad voice acting, the terrible douchiness of the main character while also portraying him as some sort of beloved hero, a ""realization"" that was more or less an obvious plot point

So this is definitely an anime then."
Neo Yokio,">  this could be The Room of ""Anime"". 

I did not.  I did not."
Neo Yokio,I actually think the way Jaden Smith plays the character adds to the characters vapid stuck up nature. 
Neo Yokio,[deleted]
Neo Yokio,The weird shit on Adult Swim can be good. The Room can be entertaining. Troll 2 can be fun. This is not.
Neo Yokio,The problem is that it's a bad parody.

This Is Us,Redditors not the target demographic
This Is Us,"For me, the overzealous promos kept me away. Every episode: the biggest shit ever is gonna hit blah blah like a ton of bricks and YOU. WILL. CRY. Like every episode, and I just don’t need that in my life."
This Is Us,"Well, I'm 27F and I really didn't like it. I watched the first couple episodes because a lot of my friends liked it when it first started, so I think there's some younger people enjoying it, but it felt like trauma porn to me.... The double timeline gimmick didn't interest me and I felt like the stories they set up had predictable ends so I stopped watching"
This Is Us,"I (30F) loved it. My whole family watched it. As someone dealing with a mom with dementia, has two other siblings, and a couple other similarities - it was definitely a heavy show to watch but it was very cathartic for me and some stuff I have dealt with in my life."
This Is Us,"It’s biggest selling point is being an incredibly earnest, melodramatic, tissues at the ready family drama with lots of “very special episodes” about race, sexuality and touchy feely stuff like that. I loved the first couple seasons and spent the majority of my time watching it in floods of tears. 

I think most Redditors prefer high concept tv shows and genre television, with a bit more of an obvious hook and a lot less emphasis on how characters feel about things. 

I doubt most Redditors would watch the Sopranos if it was just about Tony being in therapy or Breaking Bad if it was solely about Walt’s cancer treatment.

Similarly, This is Us would be a lot more popular here if it was set on a space station or if “The Big Three” were the heads of three separate crime families or something."
This Is Us,"My wife and I (27m, 28f at the time of its finale) both liked it and watched it all the way through. I came close to falling off around the end of season 3 and 4 (>!Randall running for office in a state he didn’t live in was absurd!<)but I think they wrapped it up really nicely. The overall arc of >!Kate and Toby!<, in particular, is probably one of my favorite characterizations of all time. It’s very real and raw in a way that builds slowly and beautifully. Their >!front lawn screaming match!< was well earned, believable, liberating, and painful at the same time."
This Is Us,"I watched a few episodes and it came across the same way another commenter said - ""trauma porn"". It made me feel like I simply wanted to see a show where things turn out OK for people and that's not what it was. Maybe it's a fairy tale to want to see happy endings, but real life is full of unhappy stuff - I don't really need my entertainment to also be unhappy. I also found the adult daughter to be utterly unlikeable."
This Is Us,I watched the first season but I just got tired of the constant drain on my emotions.
This Is Us,"My wife watched it all the way through. Most nights I was either playing on my pc or switch, listening in the background, so of course I can’t say I’ve watched it through and through. 

From what I understood with it was, half the characters are insufferable, which I suppose makes for good drama. 

But honestly what I could not stand was the ambient music that felt like it always played. I don’t know why, but it was like nails on a chalkboard for me."
This Is Us,"I can say why I didn't love it. 

It seemed like every episode was emotional manipulation.  Like it REALLY wanted you to cry everytime you watched it. 

I only got through a handful of episodes.  And it wasn't ""bad"" by any means, but just not the type of thing I really enjoyed.  I watch tv for escapism, this was just constant emotional rollercoasters."
This Is Us,"I watched it regularly for awhile with my ex, but it just seemed to turn into an endless cycle of ""how can we bum out the audience this week?""

I get the subject matter is serious and all, but it seemed as if the writers were just constantly trying to take away any happiness you may have felt for these characters. It got old.

Trauma porn may appeal to some people, but not to me."
This Is Us,"Yeah, it was a bit schmaltzy for me, a tearjerker primetime drama—I noticed ABC decided to jump on the bandwagon with “A Million Little Things.”"
This Is Us,My wife and I watch it. Haven’t been able to get through it all but I think we will finish it. I think we are the target demographic. Late 50s. I honestly could skip the rest but I’m curious to see how Kevin’s cabin build turns out haha. She wants to watch it seems like she’s invested in the rest of the family drama. I don’t mind my heartstrings getting pulled but I don’t like shedding a tear every freaking episode. Does seem well written overall and I like the characters and the multiple timeline is cool to me. I don’t really like the Rebecca and Randall characters they are a little too earnest to me. Maybe I just don’t like the actors not sure
This Is Us,"Reddit isnt the target demo

I actually enjoyed This is Us, nothing beats Sterling K Brown acting his ass off every episode. But i def think Parenthood does the ""giant wealthy family cry drama"" genre much better"
This Is Us,I loved the first few seasons and stopped watching after awhile.
This Is Us,Isn't it humorless? Isn't it just a parade of petty domestic gloom?
This Is Us,It just seemed like a depressing show written  to tug on viewer's emotuonal strings. Why would I watch something designed to make me feel sad?
This Is Us,it is just a depressing show.
This Is Us,"Maybe people on Reddit (me included) don’t like writing that uses melodrama as its core point of intrigue. The level of drama eventually stops being relatable because it’s so unrealistic. When the show is about people and their lives, the more relatable the better IMO."
This Is Us,I’m 45 and I can’t stand it. My wife would have it on for a while and I’d catch bits of it and it seemed to embrace the .. I don’t know .. utter fucking lameness and emptiness of middle aged life. People waiting to die. Maybe my sample size skewed my perception but I found it very unpleasant.
This Is Us,Any show that isn't made for nerdy 13-25 year old males gets a bad response on Reddit.
This Is Us,Cause it’s on network tv. Network tv has this stigma now. I’ve never watched this is us but this is my guess lmao
This Is Us,"I'm a woman in my mid-40's and I just thought it was schlocky melodrama, so I knew it wasn't for me.  Plus, I can't handle Alzheimer/dementia storylines, no matter what show it is."
This Is Us,"I thought the writing was lazy, manipulative, and cliche."
This Is Us,My dad is and he gets tortured by it. Flash back on flash backs. No one tells what they are feeling until after the appropriate ad break. Story stops in it's tracks so they can cut to the timeline of the parents or the children as adults. He wants to enjoy but the complaints make it out the major network format was detrimental
This Is Us,"I was just so incredibly depressing. We stopped watching. We started calling it the ""Sad Show""."
This Is Us,Reddit responses are typically lean towards snark or jaded followed by a bunch of band wagonning.  Ignore reddit for reviews of anything.
This Is Us,"Because it's a guilty pleasure kind of show. The writing is contrived, predictable, and basked in its melodrama. Good television and film should make you feel something, but there should be a reason for it; a greater message. This is Us almost never had anything bigger to say, and when it did, there wasn't a lot of nuance or complexity. It was there only to waste boxes of tissues and to rather hamfistedly approach social issues.

This is coming from someone who watched all six seasons with his wife. I watched the show because she really loved it, and I wanted to know what was going on so when she wanted to talk about it, I'd be able to keep up."
This Is Us,"Because it's very self-reflective, and redditors are not. Even just the title makes that painfully obvious. This is what i assume the dialogue is like:
 
""how can we go back to the way things were?""

""we have to try.""

""i'm a shell of myself and what i once was.""

""we both are.""

""this...is us.""

*cries*"
This Is Us,"Wow, I read ""This is Us"" as ""The Last of Us"" and I was wondering how all you guys got to watch the first few episodes."
This Is Us,It’s bad
This Is Us,"Started off ok, eventually so stuck so far up it’s own arse it became a mockery. Also I fucking hated Randall"
This Is Us,"It's pure manipulation. Once I found out how the dad died, I was done."
This Is Us,I’m really confused about labeling This is Us as “cerebral”. Either I have no idea what that word means or the show explores a lot more of the “seeing the characters in different time periods” thing than I understood it did.
This Is Us,"Reddit doesn't like ""normie"" content."
This Is Us,"Well, Reddit is mostly (young) men and they don't like to be in touch with their feelings."
This Is Us,"Watched a couple episodes post season 2 finale, but wasn't hooked by the new plot lines as with the story of Jack and his family. IMO S02E13-14 is unbeatable."
This Is Us,"I found it to be emotionally manipulative.  It's like they tried to come up with the more dramatic, most touching, most traumatic things they could come up with in order to create emotion in us rather than just telling a good story."
This Is Us,"I watched some of it with my wife and it just felt really mired in heavy melodrama.

Like, just dramatic as fuck for the sake of it."
This Is Us,"""Something cerebral"" is not something I would call the show."
This Is Us,I feel it’s too dramatic for me
This Is Us,No zombies or superheroes. Just assuming.
This Is Us,In part because Chapo made fun of it. Felix Biederman has a Wizard's power of making his will law.
This Is Us,I’m 33 and I fucking hate that show
This Is Us,"First few episodes are ok, and then after awhile you realize all the writers are doing is trying to  find new ways every week to make you cry, so yeah I'm out, that's not relaxing TV to watch."
This Is Us,"I personally didn't like it because it was ridiculous, every episode was just some over the top tragedy or ridiculously over the top emotional tearjerker nonsense. I could not suspend my disbelief that this much drama was happening this often in their family and I have a really dramatic family. 

Also, as personal preference, I don't like shows that go out of their way to illicit sadness from me as a response. Life has done enough things to have made me sad over the year, I don't want to set aside an hour a week to revel in that sadness.

The show did have some good moments here and there that I caught as my wife continued to watch it, but overall it just wasn't my cup of tea. I can see why people would like it though."
This Is Us,"Honestly, the later seasons get bad. The writers keep doing shit to pull on the heartstrings and it begins to feel hollow.


Also, constantly portrays Jack as a saint when he is not."
This Is Us,My wife and I watched it up until they brought Covid into it. We just didn't want to sit down after dealing with the effects of Covid in the news and in life all day and watch imaginary characters deal with Covid.
This Is Us,How many bad things can happen to a group of people?
This Is Us,"Man of 37 here. I loved This Is Us.

It's not particularly groundbreaking or original, but it's a very poignant story with good acting and compelling characters. 

It's definitely ""crying porn"" though. If feeling the feels isn't for you, then neither is this show. 

That damn train, man..."
This Is Us,"It made me feel despondent.  Just a miserable, joyless bunch of lives."
This Is Us,"I don't know anything about ""This is us"", but I've noticed in general there's a very vocal part of this site that rips everything to shreads (and other parts that build everything up to make it sound like it's the best piece of media ever). I've started to completely ignore discussion and articles on this sub (I stumbled on this post from my front page) and look to find some reviewers that I think are consistent."
This Is Us,35m and wasn’t a fan. Trauma porn is not for me. I’m also probably not the demographic
This Is Us,"Redditors answer for everything is to break up with the person and get a lawyer. ""This is us"" doesn't really hit that demographic"
This Is Us,"26F and I used to watch it religiously up until their first season that took place during Covid. Unfortunately, I get the impression that Covid production issues messed with their original storyline and plan for the show and a lot of plot points began to feel very forced. The acting was still good, but the overall the quality of the show took a sharp nosedive for me at that point.

Judging by the reactions the show sub had with the final seasons, I don’t think it ever recovered from that."
This Is Us,"I am 46/male/professional with a family. IMO, the characters on this show are absolutely exhausting to the point of being insufferable."
This Is Us,It's sadness porn.
This Is Us,"It is SO. MAUDLIN. 

Everything is teary eyed emotional breakdowns. Life is fun and not that serious sometimes, ya know?

I think Parenthood strikes a much better balance."
This Is Us,My wife watched the whole thing and I called it The Crying Show. It is an extremely well executed show in the genre of Family Melodrama. Family Melodrama is not Reddit's favorite genre.
This Is Us,"Most of Reddit is not the target audience. It gets shit on a lot because how it very intentional pulls on the heart strings. Every episode feels like ""a very special episode."" Compared to most everything on basic cable currently it is a quality show."
This Is Us,"I did watch it at first, I think the fist two seasons, but it verged in to Hallmark Channel territory

Too schmaltzy, hated the soundtrack, didn't really care anymore about the characters.  I have no idea why, I just didn't really like anyone any more."
This Is Us,"My personal and incredibly petty reason: It shoehorned Chris Sullivan as melodramatic actor rather than more of a character actor. His portrayal of Tom Cleary in The Knick has yet to be touched by any other role he's been in.

For years I looked at his IMDB hoping he would be in something else besides This Is Us, only to be disappointed to not see him branching out. Yeah, I'm glad the guy got good work, a steady paycheck in acting is hard to find, but I would have really, *really* liked to see him branch out more."
This Is Us,It doesn’t align with the type of show Redditors tend to like
This Is Us,The cast were too perfect in their imperfections.
This Is Us,"I loved the first season,  I was quickly bored with the 2nd season and quit watching."
This Is Us,I thought it was very well done so I cannot shed any light on disparaging comments
This Is Us,Because this is not us.
This Is Us,"I agree with others. Definitely not the average Reddit user demographic. I'm a male in my 50's with grown children, and I can absolutely relate to almost every episode, which is why it hits home for me so often. Most other Reddit users not so much."
This Is Us,The first season is honestly some of the most heartfelt TV i've ever seen.
This Is Us,I loved that show. I’m a 38 yo female.
This Is Us,"I was all in for the first few seasons, but it felt like they were falling into a Lost wormhole with the stalling/treading to keep Jack in flashbacks and then throwing flashforwards in an effort to avoid writing actual storylines."
This Is Us,I'm middle aged and loved it. But need to to stop. Too emotional. Too real.
This Is Us,Not the reddit demographic
This Is Us,"Me and my wife watched this show from the beginning. Over the years we had our first child and have really enjoyed it. I always laughed at some of the ridiculous stuff that happened, but what can you say it’s a tv show. And she cried/laughed at every episode for the most part. However as I’ve grown older and my family is still growing and I’ve had time to reflect on my life/family and how we want to continue. Anyway then the last season started and the “Miguel” episode hit me like a train. Best episode in the series imo and the only one to really make me shed a tear. Miguel was always a fav character of mine so maybe that did it. The Billy Joel song was one the best songs for the moment."
This Is Us,"I think it was well written but also written in a very certain way - usually there’s some tragedy and then a character has to make some melodramatic moment as a result and a big emotional monologue happens that is a frankly unrealistic crafted exposition. It pulls aggressively at the heartstrings but felt manipulative, deliberate and inauthentic. Few writing teams could pull it off but I can see how it isn’t everyone’s cup of tea, and you have to be into how fictional characters just feel about things pretty much which not everyone is into."
This Is Us,"I think it's because in a post-Sopranos world, most viewers of what is considered (by it's own viewers, which is silly) ""high"" television go to cable networks for their cerebral television. Shows like ""The Wire"", ""Breaking Bad"", ""Mad Men"", ""Mr. Robot"", and a dozen others I'm sure I failed to mention, have  changed the way people watch tv. Now, at the same time this was happening, network television became rather stagnant, which makes sense if you consider that it has to be much more accessible to a wider audience and that will inherently hinder the end-product.

So, yeah, I could see someone scoffing at ""This Is Us"" if recommended. My wife personally loves it and for all the same reasons you listed. I haven't given it a chance, so, I can't say for sure, but we usually agree on television and movies."
This Is Us,"Because it's emotionally manipulative and thrives off of ""this week you'll REALLY cry!!"" advertising. It's.. disingenuous."
This Is Us,"It was a very well-done show in every way. The writing, acting, editing, etc., are all top-notch. It’s about as good as long-form TV storytelling gets these days. And it addresses issues like mental illness, race, and gender in ways that are both enlightening and less heavy-handed than many other shows do. 

Having said that, it is a big-budget, family melodrama on US network TV, with all the constraints and predictable rhythms that that entails. With a large ensemble cast, there always has to be something going on with every main character, and that means that sometimes a minor story arc is unnecessary or uninteresting. There often has to be an emotional crisis at the end of an episode to keep you primed for the next one. And someone is always making a dumb life choice because you need that kind of thing to generate the conflict that keeps a TV drama going. 

All of those are valid criticisms. But you’d have a hard time finding a TV drama series that doesn’t do things at least occasionally."
This Is Us,"I would usually watch part of a season and then forget about it and catch up later. There were some storylines I really didn’t care for but as a whole I enjoyed the show and ended up watching it all the way through. 

I can see why some don’t like it, though. The music was very “you should be crying now” sometimes and some of the storylines didn’t land."
This Is Us,I’ve never really seen that but I’ve only started following the television sub for about three months. I enjoyed every season and almost every episode of that show. I have no idea if I’m the target demographic my dad is a Vietnam vet.
This Is Us,It’s probably too intimate and emotional for people and if they witnessed the same things happening in the show that have happened to them they’re going to have a really hard time opening up about that and it’s probably going to trigger them to be in a mood that makes them hate the show.  The scene where the house fire starts completely broke me. I keep telling my wife that the streaming services don’t have new seasons. I really don’t wanna watch more. But I don’t hate it.
This Is Us,I adore that show!! Low key suspect it was produced by Kleenex...
This Is Us,the first season was amazing.
This Is Us,"Because the genre asks people to have emotions, and some people believe that emotions are something to be guarded and finally won instead of something freely given"
This Is Us,"My wife watched and loved this show. I watched the first 2 or 3 episodes and stopped. I decided that I didn't want to make myself miserable watching other's misery. My opinion is that people who enjoy this show are sadists or watch because it makes them feel better about their own life. ""My life isn't so bad. It could be worse. Look at these people suffering"". I just couldn't watch a show that made me feel bad. I think the description ""trauma porn"" is very fitting and that is sad.

I just realized that I'm not sure what this says about my wife."
This Is Us,"I'm over 50M.  Show is well-acted , well-written and I really liked it the first 2 yrs but just stopped watching at a certain point as the stories and flashbacks just seemed to become more unrealistic or were just trying to manipulate my emotions way too much.

The show gets put on Netflix the yr after it runs, so I'd usually watch it there.  Haven't watched the 2nd to last season and the last Season is coming to Netflix next month, I believe.  I want to finish it, I invested a lot of time and emotion into it.

Some people compared the targeted demographic to The White Lotus but the latter show is more of a fantasy/drama/comedy in a beautiful locale where we watch rich people act like dicks."
This Is Us,"I'm 50, remarried with 4 kids all in their 20s.  My wife enjoyed it, so I saw pieces of it.  I found the characters to be annoying and the show to be too much of a pity fest."
This Is Us,"I liked the first season, but I quit watching mid season 2 when the selfishness of all the children got to be too much."
This Is Us,"It was too fucking heavy.

I didn’t make it out the first season"
This Is Us,"It seems like a show that is written just to make people emotional and that's not really interesting to me.  It's trauma porn, with the most boring trauma possible."
This Is Us,Reddit is negative on everything so you shouldn’t care about what they feel.
This Is Us,Every time we'd see an ad for it my girlfriend and I would both comment that it looks unbearably depressing and we'd both agree that it didn't interest us.
This Is Us,[deleted]
This Is Us,"I found it preachy and condescending.  Oh, here is an attempt of mostly skinny writers forcing you to feel something about overweight women.  Here is an attempt of mostly white writers forcing you to feel something about mixed race families.  There wasn't much room for the audience to draw it's own conclusions...we were force fed somebody else's conclusions."
This Is Us,"Loved the first season, it should have stayed there.  They got too woke in the following seasons."
This Is Us,everyone on reddit hates everything
This Is Us,"Because it doesn't star an anti hero or rely on gratuitous violence. It's a solid, sometimes cheesey family drama. Redditors aren't emotionally mature enough to appreciate it."
This Is Us,"Ridiculous reason: I can’t stand Mandy Moore and vow to never watch anything she’s in. Other reason: Lots of people I know said, “It’s so good, so sad, every episode makes me cry.” Nope. Not at all interested in that for my tv entertainment."
This Is Us,"I’m basically the same age as the characters were in the present. It hit home in a lot of ways about family, growing up, parenthood, compromising. I feel like it was for the Xennials for sure and worked for me."
Manhunt,"the more Tobias,  the better"
Manhunt,"wonder if he really is gonna be in the green lanterns show too...could have been just a rumour then I suppose.

From the title I though it would be a part of that other manhunt series(one with sam Worthington etc...think it was an anthology show)

Honestly apple seems fairly solid so far.suprisingly solid actually. I do think their big budget shows need to be a bit more interesting tho.."
Manhunt,The most underrated actor in television. I adore him.
Manhunt,Amazing actor!
Manhunt,He looks halfway between Taron Egerton and Heath Ledger
Manhunt,Frank > Jamie
Manhunt,"So to be clear it's not the third season of Manhunt (2017).

Excited to see what how it is."
Manhunt,Seems like this has been in development hell for decades. I remember Harrison Ford was growing a goatee for it like 15 years ago
Manhunt,[deleted]
Manhunt,"This is one of these shows that's bounced around from one channel to another, and now a streaming service.  The first season, I believe, was on Discovery (it was about the Unabomber, played by Paul Bettany, who does an amazing job).  The 2nd season, about the Atlanta bombing, was on Spectrum and later aired on CBS (which is where I watched it).  I don't have Apple, but hopefully I'll be able to catch this eventually, it's an entertaining series and you can cover a lot of different stories throughout history."
Manhunt,false
Manhunt,"What a fucking laughingstock they made his character on GoT.

Glad to see him in other roles."
Manhunt,Brutus hunting John Wilkes Booth is a good one.
Manhunt,Is this going to be connected to the *Manhunt* series that is already going on? The first season was about the Unabomber and the second season was about Eric Rudolph?
Manhunt,Can't wait to hear his American accent.
Manhunt,Hope so. He'd be a good sinestro. Although part of me really does wish they'd get Strong back. That movie was the definition of mediocre but Mark killed it as sinestro.
Manhunt,">From the title I though it would be a part of that other manhunt series(one with sam Worthington etc...think it was an anthology show)

It is an anthology show. Season two dealt with the Atlanta bombing.

Was pretty solid until it went a bit off the rails with the FBI teaming up with local militia to find him. Still kinda enjoyable."
Manhunt,"What even is the status of that, I thought it was supposed to start filming like last summer or something. They announced two cast members then silence."
Manhunt,Is the GL show even going to happen? It’s been a couple years since it was announced and we haven’t heard anything about it.
Manhunt,"Thanks for this comment. I was confused. My thought process:

Season one was about finding the unabomber. Season two was about finding who set off a bomb at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta. Season three is gonna be be about finding who killed Abraham Lincoln?? Quite a departure for the season. But I can get behind it."
Manhunt,I just watched the HBO series Succession. The Cameron actor plays a major role. It was the first time I've seen him in anything since Ferris.
Manhunt,"> 
Was pretty solid until it went a bit off the rails with the FBI teaming up with local militia to find him

probably cause ""FBI kinda wanders through the woods for 6 years until hes caught rummaging through the trash at a save-a-lot"" is not the most compelling tv."
Manhunt,Think they should start filming early this year...hopefully
Manhunt,only started casting last year. was supposed I think to film last year but got delayed but yea likely early this year...
Manhunt,"Oh agreed 100%

I was wondering how they were going to do that and I guess they found a way."
Manhunt,"I know the show itself didn’t work for some people, but I don’t think you can deny Hamish was incredible in *Midnight Mass.*"
Manhunt,This book was awesome and this series is going to be even more awesome. The book read like The Fugitive and JFK fused together. I can’t wait to see it.
Manhunt,He’s playing Lincoln in this which I can actually totally see.
Manhunt,David Lynch's The Sims
Manhunt,Bioshock 1 and then infinite after. Halo Reach would also be pretty sick
Manhunt,"I'd love to see a surreal Alan Wake limited series.

I could also see them pulling off the scale, comedy, and irreverence of an original Borderlands story."
Manhunt,"So many people ask for an adaptation of red dead 2 but I don’t know if they understand that it’s just a big amalgamation of other western stories, and pulls pretty heavily from them.

Like if the average viewer saw the second train robbery scene they’d accuse it of being pulled directly from the assassination of jesse james, because it is lol."
Manhunt,"Control


Half Life 1/2"
Manhunt,"Half Life 1/2 would be sick.

Especially if it completes the story!"
Manhunt,Uncharted
Manhunt,Mass Effect.   Henry Cavill in his never ending quest to star in every major genre property/ universe teased a while back that one with him may be in the early development stages.
Manhunt,Bioshock
Manhunt,Planescape: Torment
Manhunt,"I think Horizon Zero Dawn could be great, but would take more work in the writing episode to episode.

Mass Effect? Too obvious? 

Detriot: Become Human could have potential.

So could Control."
Manhunt,Dragon Age
Manhunt,"An Elder Scrolls show would be interesting...

Perhaps something set around the time of the fall of the Ayleid Empire and slave rebellion?

And whatever happened to the supposed Diablo show that was supposed to be coming?  I'd like to see a live-action adaptation of the Diablo game series."
Manhunt,Wolfenstein
Manhunt,"I want an Elder Scrolls series. 

Not based on the games since those can get a little tricky but something based in the world would be awesome. 

But do it right. Spend the money on production and costume design and practical effects"
Manhunt,Red Dead Redemption
Manhunt,SpaceQuest V
Manhunt,Duck hunt
Manhunt,"Disco Elysium.

No fucking clue how, but I’d love to see the attempt."
Manhunt,Metal gear solid…I mean there are some movie long cutscenes in there already.
Manhunt,Half Life !
Manhunt,Manhunt.
Manhunt,Half Life for sure
Manhunt,FALLOUTTT
Manhunt,Shadow of the Colossus
Manhunt,FF7
Manhunt,"In the Last of Us podcast, Craig Maizin revealed that HBO essentially asked him which Sony game he wanted to adapt. So perhaps there's a chance or some sort of permission there.

I'd like to pick Bloodborne, but it would be more of an inspiration than anything else as besides the world, lore, and some characters it wouldn't particularly have plot to go off of."
Manhunt,"Oh god I dont.

There are so many amazing spec scripts floating around-- I want to see something new, not making the same 20 people richer with a tv spinoff.

Make media creative again."
Manhunt,"something that isn't extremely popular, even if there's no chance.

edit: definitely something sci fi/fantasy though."
Manhunt,"I know it’s in the works else where, but I’d like to see Twisted Metal or Bio Shock"
Manhunt,"They should adapt Dig-Dug, but set it in an eastern Kentucky coal mining town."
Manhunt,Singularity
Manhunt,F.E.A.R.
Manhunt,Half-life 2
Manhunt,"If they were to tackle another video game adaptation, I'd like to see *Vagrant Story* done as a limited series. Even as old as the game is, it's still quite cinematic and still has some of the best written dialogue in gaming. 

It's dark fantasy, but in a much different way from everything else out there, and I don't think it'd be too difficult to expand the story and flesh the characters out sufficiently for a one off season of television. 

Realistically, though, I could see HBO pursuing the rights to something like *Disco Elysium*, or (though less likely, I think) maybe even *BioShock*."
Manhunt,Legacy of Kain
Manhunt,"Heavy Rain for sure, it would be perfect as a limited series. And Life Is Strange too. 

I think Broken Sword and Secret Files would also be cool to adapt, but I would be a little more skeptical because it would be easier to mess them up

Also seconding people who are saying Mass Effect, Bioshock and Dragon Age."
Manhunt,Bioshock
Manhunt,"It's going to be heresy but I've long since stood that Silent Hill 2 could make for a really good TV show, or even movie. This idea once came from a youtube video I watched, that's probably long since been deleted, that was called ""Silent Hill 2, The Movie"" where they basically took the cutscenes of the game, strung together with the recorded footage of james walking place to place and solving some (but not all) of the puzzles with some fights here and there. Cutting out a lot of the more arbitrary back tracking and stuff, basically just editing it into a more cohesive straight forward narrative for people to watch. And while it wasn't as good as playing the game its self; it still worked. And a director who actually  gave a shit could start with that concept and turn it into something that does well to take ideas the game plays with and adapt them to screen.

But it won't happen."
Manhunt,"I’m surprised I got to the end of the thread without seeing Ghost of Tsushima. Great story, terrific setting and the wandering samurai trope has endless stories to tell"
Manhunt,"None. There are very few gaming IP that would work as prestige HBO series. I can think of games that I would like to see get proper film adaptations. But in terms of TV and HBO, there isn't much outside of maybe some weird shit like Control. And even then, the game itself doesn't really lend itself to a serialized format. It has really interesting ideas and striking artistic design, but would have to be retooled significantly for TV/Film. And this is largely true of most games. Most games don't have great stories. They have good stories for servicing gameplay. But The Last of Us is already great as a cinematic gaming nerrative and requires minimal retooling."
Manhunt,I'm hoping Amazon does a good job with the future Fallout series. But if they don't maybe it can be taken over by HBO. Or I would like to see GTA San Andreas be produced into at least a mini series or 4-5 season. I belive they had one of the greatest GTA story's written.
Manhunt,Days Gone
Manhunt,"Max Payne, staring Bryan Cranston"
Manhunt,Let’s see how TLOU pans out first. But there are many possible choices.
Manhunt,"Portal would be fun! 
Obviously, it would be tricky/impossible to retell the game story because it’s literally just one person, alone, solving puzzles. But I think a prequel miniseries about Aperture Labs and their rise to power and world dominance would be awesome. It could open up a lot of creative possibilities to expand on the backstory told in the games."
Manhunt,Splinter cell! Gimme some Sam Fischer
Manhunt,"Man so wanted HBO to adapt The Witcher, they are the only ones I guess can do it justice, because books really aren't that complex to adapt. Because Netflix just butchered it.  


Another game I would say is, maybe a Mass Effect or a Cyberpunk show, they don't really have any space or a good sci/fi show on their plate right now.  


Or maybe I guess they can just adapt anything by the OG writers of Bioware games or CDPR games, because they are really good at it."
Manhunt,"I would absolutely love an HBO show set in the Cyberpunk 2077 world (I know Edgerunners was supposed to be really good, but the live action sets nailing that Cyberpunk vibe with a gritty story would be amazing)."
Manhunt,"Borderlands would be amazing.

Devil May Cry also has a great story."
Manhunt,"Devil May Cry      
    
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)"
Manhunt,Disco Elysium.
Manhunt,Star Wars: Battlefront (or Republic Commando) in Generation Kill style. But then Disney owns Star Wars so that wouldn't happen.
Manhunt,Nothing after the last of us was such a mess and hotd only barely tied with rings of power in ratings
Manhunt,Runescape
Manhunt,Civ 4
Manhunt,Shovel knight
Manhunt,Tetris
Manhunt,FFVII?
Manhunt,metal gear solid
Manhunt,Pac Man
Manhunt,"Broken Sword

OGs know"
Manhunt,Final Fantasy 6.
Manhunt,"Soma, bonus if they get Alex Garland to helm it."
Manhunt,The Forest would make a great horror movie. It’d be like The Descent. You might need to add a couple other survivors to add some dialogue though.
Manhunt,"Mass effect, transfer the halo franchise to them, I think fallout could be fun."
Manhunt,Crossy Road
Manhunt,God of war. Just because I am sure that amazon will royally fuck it up
Manhunt,Deus Ex: Human Revolution. The backstory to the world with the 'mechanical apartheid' and ongoing conflict between the extremist sides of the augmented and non-augmented is really interesting.
Manhunt,Deadspace
Manhunt,Twisted metal is coming but I’m worried
Manhunt,"Grim Fandango. It's such an out there concept that I'd love to see someone adapt it for screen. It'd have to be a limited series I think but the story is solid and the world building great. 

In a similar vein, Broken Sword could quite easily be adapted into the Da Vinci Code style thriller. There's a lot more story there to adapt too so it could span a few series."
The Five,"> The total number of drama and comedy pilots that the broadcast networks have collectively been ordering is moving in the opposite direction of Peak TV.


> While the number of overall scripted originals continues to soar, ABC, CBS, Fox, NBC and The CW had started rethinking their individual approaches to pilots before the pandemic. Now, two years into making television with costly COVID-19 protocols, the five networks have shifted to more of a year-round development model as the days of producing nearly 100 combined pilots have come and gone.


> This season, the five broadcasters have (so far) ordered only 34 pilots combined — that’s the lowest tally in at least a decade — and down significantly from the pre-pandemic days when 60 was considered a record low. While sources say a handful of additional orders may still be to come, this year’s 34 comedies and dramas are still down from last year’s sum, which included 20 pilots that were carried over from 2020 when the global production shutdown wiped out pilot season.

> Of course, the industry’s shift to streaming has played a role in where media titans allocate their spending. As the price on scripted originals soars thanks to rising costs associated with filming during covid and competition for top talent, the days of networks buying 300 scripts each development season have vanished. Now, many are taking a more nuanced approach to which scripts move forward to pilot as the networks examine their schedules and weigh the costs of replacing aging and bubble shows with new ones that afford them to set new streaming pacts on their own respective platforms."
The Five,"It was always an overblown throw everything at the wall and see what sticks, but lots of workers rely on pilots. Hoping it means that have just spread the “season” out over the full year rather than reduced the amount of productions this dramatically."
The Five,"if i ran networks, i'd look to revive series that had cult followings and market the heck out of it (usually the problem of why they failed in the first place) 

shows like Happy Endings, Firefly to lesser known stuff like Selfie (but now whose stars are even more mainstream)"
The Five,The Networks seem to be slowly reducing the number of scripted shows they air each year so it is no surprise they need less pilots. It is not as bleak as scripted on cable but it is definitely trending in that direction.
The Five,"As it should have, now if only we could get some of those biscuits!"
The Five,"> Ted Lasso led all winners at the 37th annual Television Critics Association’s 2021 Awards.


> The Apple TV+ rookie comedy took home wins in three of the five categories in which it was nominated. The Jason Sudeikis football comedy — which led all nominees — earned victory in all three of the TCA’s biggest categories: program of the year, new program and achievement in comedy.


> Among all platforms, it was HBO/HBO Max that edged Apple TV+ and nominations leader Netflix as Michaela Coel earned achievement in drama for 'I May Destroy You'; Jean Smart bested Sudeikis for comedy; 'Mare of Easttown' collected the win for limited series; and John Oliver continued to rule the variety category. Netflix earned three wins, including drama for The Crown."
The Five,"Just a reminder, the TCA isn’t a real awards thing in any possible way. 

It’s a press event where companies just get a bank of celebrity interviews for the year, they use the “award” as a disguise to get celebs to show up and do interviews and if they do, they’ll give them an award. 

Celebs literally go room to room in basically a hotel giving like 5-10 minute interviews non stop to various media outlets. That’s all it is."
The Five,[babish](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_yBqWHtWMo) made a video on them if interested in baking projects.
The Five,"...well I liked it.    
Can't wait for Capaldi's doctor. "
The Five,The episode could have used a two hour long episodes. So many threads were tied up in one episode. Made it feel very fast. Still an enjoyable special and the regeneration monologue was very appropriate for Smith's Doctor. A man who tried to forget now vows to remember. I thought it was touching. 
The Five,"Eccleston's Doctor still remains my favorite. The emotional range, especially in that awkward ""date"" with last Slitheen was brilliant. He doesn't get nearly enough credit due to David Tennants tenure. "
The Five,He aged but he didn't change as a person the way you'd naturally expect from someone with centuries of experiences under their belt. He spent as much time fighting off the Daleks as he did the entirety of that regeneration but it didn't change him at all. He didn't grow as a person in that time. It comes off as a contrived plot device instead of a narrative character building  element.
The Five,"Wasn't thrilled with the episode, but I liked the few seconds we got to spend with the new doctor. Seems promising, and it'll be nice to have an older doctor for a change."
The Five,"Y'know... I really enjoyed Matt Smith's departing speech to the audience, because let's be honest... it wasn't really The Doctor talking until Amy Pond came into frame. 

I have to say though, am I the only one a bit bothered by the predictability of whenever a Doctor regenerates, with regards to the new series, that they have to prove how quirky they are? New teeth, new legs... new kidneys? 

""I'm going to point out a weirdish body part and have something extremely normal to say about it, but it'll sound nonsensical!"" "
The Five,"Many things about this episode bothered me. Just to name a couple:

1 - All the momentum from the Day of the Doctor seemed to be gone. Sure the prospect of his home coming back was there, but all the bad guys in orbit still wouldn't amount to the ""billions of billions"" of Daleks that we're threatening Galifrey during the Time War... Especially since they were all being held at bay by one army as it was. He could have spoken his name, brought the Time Lords back and mopped up the riff-raff in orbit no problem with the Pope army + Time Lord army. I don't get the necessity of the 3 hundred years he hung around fixing toys. (I get the stalemate philosophy, but come on!)

2 - His Time Lord empowered regeneration defeated all the bad guys... See also #1. If that's all it took to win, why didn't he... Oh never mind.

3 - All the buildup over the Silence and the radical religious group and the Headless dedicated to destroying the doctor. They create an assassin from his companions baby and ""kill"" him at the lake... then fight alongside him at the Christmas village in a couple throwaway lines. Yeah, Mofat needed to elaborate in that a bit more. A chance to make that more epic was missed in favor of the Doctor looking aged with hundreds of drawings from kids on his walls. This felt like the biggest waste...

4 - Poor Handles. This is just something that bugged me. He died because he needed new parts while the Tardis was sitting outside with it's infinite supply of spare parts... /facepalm

I have more, but I no longer want to think about this episode.
"
The Five,I liked this regeneration a lot. None of that feature changing/video superimposing stuff. It was unexpected and effective. I'm looking forward to seeing a geezer back in the role.
The Five,I'm looking forward to Peter Capaldi being the next Doctor
The Five,I was quite excited for the episode but found it mostly fell flat. It was fairly confusing as well.
The Five,Was the boyfriend thing weird for anybody else. It struck me as 'off' 
The Five,"I hate to say it, since I am a big fan of the series, but I did not think it was a very good episode. Maybe a 6/10.

I cannot really say why but it just did not have the same energy and depth of storyline we have come to expect. "
The Five,But it was so limp tho.... BAM.. I'm now Malcolm Tucker... fuckity fuck.. tardis
The Five,I'm glad to see the Donna love here. My most down voted post was for suggesting that she was the best companion. God forbid the Companion doesn't get all doe eyed about the Doctor and has the nerve to call him on his bullshit.
The Five,"Serious question to Doctor Who fans, but how do you deal with the thought that this show will never actually end? I don't like getting sucked into a series that I know has no real chance of ending within the next few years because I don't like waiting for episodes. I'm just curious how you guys feel about it."
The Five,"It was... okay, really didn't like how the proper regeneration where the doctor actually changed his face was too quick, it's like they used all the budget on the reset thing on the tower, killing the Daleks.

Also was it me, or was the music and sound effects a bit too loud in the post regeneration scene? I had to watch it again with headphones to hear what was actually going on."
The Five,Regeneration? Sounds like an Easter special.
The Five,"I have enjoyed Doctor Who since its revival in 2005, but this past season was... There was a lot of build up for nothing, I guess. I think Jenna Louise-Coleman is adorable and a great actress, but Clara totally fell flat. The only memorable episode of this past series, for me, was the ghost hunting one or whatever. Otherwise... ???? Meh. It jumped around too much. 

The last 15 minutes of this episode were amazing, though. So good! However, the other hour of it? Like, how did any of it even fit? I love Moffat and I typically will stand up for him, but I hope that he gets his shit together and Clara gets fleshed out with this new Doctor."
The Five,"Really great ending for my favorite doctor.  
That regeneration scene was like a punch to the face haha but i think a long Tennant style regeneration wouldnt have fit 11th.    

KIDNEYS!"
The Five,"Ten Million? And all I read is that the great days of national shared television experience are over. To much scattered viewing, internet TV etc etc. And there we have it 10 million in a country of 60 million sat down and watched the same programme at the same time. TV is maybe dying, but it sure as hell has some life in it yet."
The Five,It's on my DVR. I haven't watched it yet because I don't want Smith's run to end. I do this with every Doctor. 
The Five,But did they like the color of the Doctor's new kidneys?
The Five,"I thought the episode was decent enough, not one of the strongest episodes but definitely not one of the worst. I thought it tied up some of the loose ends, even if it was done messily. I was expecting The Silence to have a much bigger role in Eleven's story. I feel like they smushed all that stuff into a really quick voice-over/montage thing. 

I was confused at the bit with the Weeping Angels, as well. How did Clara and The Doctor escape the Angels? It didn't look like the angels became permanently quantum-locked after seeing each other. Why didn't they keep chasing after them?"
The Five,"The Doctor says ""fuckity"" now.  Saying ""fuckity"" is cool!"
The Five,"No one has really commented on this yet, so I will. I'm sorry, but Clara is by far the most one-dimensional companion yet. She has no personality, and she is PERFECT in every way. Her character is so underdeveloped, it makes me not like the show anymore. I don't think any of this is Jenna Louise Coleman's fault, but I think Moffat does not know how to write complex female characters. SIGH. "
The Five,I also watched the Queens annual Christmas address. Now I understand conformity better. It wasn't queeny enough. 
The Five,The special was way too short for me. The pacing at the start was perfect then every moment started to move extremely quickly. This special would have been better if they gave it the amount of time Tennant's finale had.
The Five,[deleted]
The Five,The way his face changed in the end made me think...Valar Morghulis.
The Five,Is there any way for us Americans to watch the episode? I went on BBC's website and it says I have to wait 6 days :(
The Five,"I didn't understand that he aged about 300 years from his beginning with Smith to the Christmas episode, and had no real visible signs of aging yet adding another 300 withers him to the old man state."
The Five,"Buy presents

Eat expensive food

Watch tv


What a beautiful tradition"
The Five,"...he changed too quick. Like seriously, don't blink."
The Five,So I didn't watch the last doctor's episodes. Does that mean I can still start with this one? I've seen all tenant's. 
The Five,Matt Smith's last scene where he hallucinates was so hammy.
The Five,"This episode kind of sums up Smith's tenure.

Great Doctor let down by awful writing. "
The Five,"For those who says ""Spoilers"" it was really obvs"
The Five,"I liked the episode. It wasn't perfect and there were some pacing issues, but it kept me on the edge of my seat and I thought Matt Smith got a great sendoff."
The Five,"Capaldi seems quite cool, hopefully he will stay for a long while though..."
The Five,"I thought they did a great job.  For the first time in a long time, I felt like the Doctor might actually be going somewhere instead of wandering aimlessly.

I have no idea why people are complaining about this episode.   I guess it's because people on reddit bitch about everything all the time...why would this be different.

"
The Five,"I know I probably shouldn't mention this, finding myself surounded by fans here - but I do find Dr. Who incredibly camp, silly and completely lacking in any sort of tension or engagement. I just can't take it seriously at all. I think if it didn't take itself so seriously I might be able to digest it, but the fact that I am expected to find all this frightening or tense is beyond laughable. 

I'd also be interested in seeing a demographic of fan's gender. I'm convinced most of females - which isn't a problem but it does confirm for me that most of the attraction of the show is largely due to actual attraction to the Doctor - much like Twilight in that respect."
The Five,With the creation of the DVR we can't seem to make it thru a basic 1 hour show without pausing 15 times. I think I'll wait a couple hours until everyone's asleep and watch this peacefully.
The Five,Does this mean I can FINALLY watch the latest seaon on Netflix now?!?
The Five,"So is this new doctor a good point to start watching the series? I feel like I'm missing out, but I can't go through all of that previous stuff, it's just too much. Hell, it was a struggle to get through Breaking Bad, haha. "
The Five,"Eh, I loved it. There was a point where some asshole started slicing onions, but other than that..."
The Five,"While I am sure a lot of people were watching for the regeneration scene I think a large majority of those extra viewers might have been there waiting for EastEnders to start. Considering that the program EastEnders lead into, Mrs. Brown's Boys, was the highest rated show of the day could add evidence to that. You also have the fact that Coronation Street would have just ended I think it is more the 8.3 million who watched the episode + people who happened to have it on  TV."
The Five,"This should almost certainly be moffats last season. He's done some great stuff but the series needs a definitively non moffat renewal now. Enough is enough.

That episode was outright terrible. Everything was wrong there. It was completely overpacked and boring at the same time. It barely made any sense whatsoever. I almost couldn't believe how little I cared towards the end. It was weird in that respect. Enough. Moffat has done great stuff, Matt smith was a great doctor, but it needs a handover. On some level I think moffat could use a break from it as well.

He could always come back in a few years and write a few episodes. God knows it worked out well when he was doing that under Davies. He wrote some of the greatest scripts ever produced."
The Five,"Weirdly,  doctor who and top gear are my favorite shows,  even though I'm American "
The Five,"The 11th doctor arc has been terrible. Poor ideas, badly executed, rushed explanations... I wish we had Moffat and RTD co show running. Moffat doing excellent episode writing and RTD in charge of the arc."
The Five,A lot of people are asleep through most of these shows.
The Five,"...he changed too quick. Like seriously, don't blink."
The Five,"I don't know about anyone else, but that episode of Doctor Who yesterday was abysmal. It made sense, but it was still a massive pile of crap."
The Five,[deleted]
The Five,"It was pretty disappointing to me. I'd just really like Moffat to take his leave and allow someone else to tackle Doctor Who. 

I'm tired of the contrived, formulaic episodes where everything gets resolved by some wacky deus ex machina. Just my opinion. "
The Five,"Who really cares?

10 million people out of 7 billion people on the planet ain't shit.

I bet the most watched television shows are all in China anyways, so this is bullshit to begin with."
The Five,Am I silly in that I was hoping Handles would be like the new K9 and be an ongoing character with Capaldi's doctor?
The Five, i was forced to watch it and god was it lame...lets hope there is a bit more Malcolm Tucker to the new doc and a lot less emo.
The Five,"*The Doctor*'s regeneration.

^^^^^^Sorry."
The Five,"I watch it every year, yet its fucking terrible. I think i watch it purely so I have something to be annoyed about (British mentality). It seriously a terrible TV show. "
The Five,"I am a big sci-fi fan, *love* Star Trek TNG and DS9. 

I don't understand the appeal Doctor Who though. It seems so overrated.
"
The Five,"not very impressive as the last show let me tell ya....i hate to say it but id a brought by time lords buds back....they wanked this up bad....

as usual..."
The Five,"My biggest issue with the episode, was right at the end with Capaldi. It seemed like his ""character"" piggy-backed off of Tennant's incarnation of the doctor, it was almost like listening to Tennant thirty years down the road. I was expecting Capaldi to give a darker feel to the doctor, that was the vibe I expected after his short screen time on The Day of The Doctor."
The Five,It will never be as good as Star Trek...watched both since the sixties in the UK...sorry Doc...Tiberius wins.
The Five,"I went back to the beginning and started from the very first show. I grew up on Tom Baker and am now up to Patrick Troughton, however, William Hartnell is now my true fave doctor. He was the 1st (canonically, the 2nd after the War Doctor), but his rendition of the doctor is so cool. Going from Tom Baker to William Hartnell is like going (experience-wise) from Kirk to Picard."
The Five,As someone who recorded this and has yet to watch it: why the fuck would you spoil it with that title?
The Five,Spoiler alert on that title.  Jesus christ!
The Five,[deleted]
The Five,"Great!  Thanks for spoiling the episode in a reddit title!  Lots of us haven't been able to see it yet, and it's pricks like you who make it so easy to hate."
The Five,">Doctor Who regeneration tops Christmas Day TV ratings

FFFFFUUUUUUUU----  I hadn't watched the episode yet.  God fucking dammit."
The Five,"Thanks for the spoiler, I havent seen it yet."
The Five,I liked it. Need to watch it again with subtitles though for the especially britishy bits.
The Five,"I actually loved it. Many complain about the irrelevant scenes, like the nudity or Christmas dinner, but I don't see why everything in the episode needs to be leading up to some ultimate, grand plot or climax. It was lighthearted and amusing, just like in any doctor who episode."
The Five,"It felt more like they were wasting time than they ran out of it. The whole scene with Clara at Christmas dinner, then sending her back, then her returning, then him sending her back again, then her being picked up again. Frivolous.

The other annoying aspect was the unchanging Doctor after centuries. Seriously? Eleven had been around for, what, 300 years or so? He sends Clara off and 300 years later she comes back. That's the entire timespan that he had been active! You'd expect a world of difference in the man. Not to mention that change between that visit and the next one after that. This Doctor would have seen so much more violence and bloodshed than the Hurt Doctor and yet seems unphased sans aging."
The Five,"Eccleston and Tennant were back to back fantastic doctors, I think we were spoiled in fact. It's really unfortunate that Eccleston felt the atmostphere got so negative. Dr who is one of those roles that can too easily define you."
The Five,I speculate that people who liked Eccleston *might* like Cepaldi. There is a similar casting against type going on there. 
The Five,Eccleston was fantastically edgy.
The Five,It was a travesty not having him in the anniversary special.
The Five,Will always be my favorite Doctor. 
The Five,"> Eccleston's Doctor still remains my favorite.

Tennant is hands down my favorite.  He loved the role and it showed.  Eccleston may have done a good job (much better than Matt Smith), but Eccleston's attitude towards the series is very much lacking for me.  As good as he was, I wish he'd never been a Doctor.  He didn't deserve the role."
The Five,The whole episode felt like that. And that he remembered the silence were there is a bit of a plot hole.
The Five,"Just so you know, Moffat has said that what we've seen of Capaldi is not how he'll be playing The Doctor, it's just post regeneration madness."
The Five,They really shouldn't have gone with Tucker eyes as the first shot.
The Five,"classic old person ""do you know how to fly this""
Reminds me of my grandma ""How do I get the mail on my computer"""
The Five,"They have been doing the quirky act after each regeneration since at least the 70s. Acting eccentric is just something they do to lighten the mood of the Doctor having to regenerate,"
The Five,"Agreed! Tennant's teeth thing was funny and clever, and I actually liked Smith's intro as well just because it seemed to suit his personality, or maybe I was just happy for some light-heartedness after the bawlfest of his regeneration... but when Capaldi said ""New kidneys!"" I was just like ""Oh...that joke again."""
The Five,If you changed sbody wouldn't you feel the need to point out something?
The Five,I have no issue with the colour of my kidneys.
The Five,"Isn't the silly quirkiness the entire show? I tried to watch it but the plastic men were too much.

""I'm going home."" 

""Well why would you do that?""

It's funny because most people go home at some point, and he questioned why. "
The Five,"What the flaming funk do any of you know??  Sorry but I have to say,  the new doctor is going to funk your shit up.  (cheers autocorrect) 


Sorry,  not a reply to Op but that look on the new doctor,  and anyone who knows the guys work knows the intensity he can project with his glaring eyes,  he'll ask you to make  him a sandwich and you'll get shivers down your spine.  I think you're about to get a whole new take on what interacting with a vastly superior,  somewhat benevolent alien would be like,  I envision  times when trapped with the doctor and the monster is going to be twice as scary as before.  and I think,  for young children anyway,  it's going to be rather terrifying fun!


Less money for effects this season I guess,  but a more dramatic tone should cover quite well if the stories pick up the tone you get in that first glare from our new Dr Who.  


"
The Five,"That's kind of been the crux of the slow decline of this show. It started with fish fingers and custard in season 6 and now it's moved on to bald naked doctors who collect bits and bobs of their enemies and turn them into wacky accessories. It's like they're writing for the most pedestrian level of the fanbase now, the tween girls who buy all their shit at Hot Topic and buy bowties for their boyfriends.
"
The Five,">3 - All the buildup over the Silence and the radical religious group and the Headless dedicated to destroying the doctor.

Yeah, Mofat needed to elaborate in that a bit more. A chance to make that more epic was missed in favor of the Doctor looking aged with hundreds of drawings from kids on his walls. This felt like the biggest waste...

They were trying to kill him to stop him from ever reaching Trenzalore, in order to prevent a new time war. That failed, so they fought with him."
The Five,I had exactly the same concerns.
Time: The Kalief Browder Story,"Thanks! Been passing it by for a while now, but I just don't want much television. This was the push I needed to check it out.

Have a great week!"
Time: The Kalief Browder Story,Easily the best documentary I've ever seen. Absolutely riveting.
Time: The Kalief Browder Story,Very powerful and well done 
Time: The Kalief Browder Story,I’m really gripped by the story but I found it distracting to have the focus jumping around in the first episode and couldn’t finish it.  Did anyone else find the pacing to be choppy? I just wanted to begin by knowing the night in question and it couldn’t smoothly deliver it.
Time: The Kalief Browder Story,"It's been on my watch list for a while, just started it. Are the clips from Rikers of him or general clips? "
Time: The Kalief Browder Story,You too! Many thanks for the kindness 
Time: The Kalief Browder Story,"Exactly, it was like one long trailer, kept repeating itself. Poor editing. I  got about 20 minutes in and gave up."
Time: The Kalief Browder Story,Both I think. The bits of him are CCTV 
Time: The Kalief Browder Story,"Yeah, just did the whole thing. The clip of him in the orange jumpsuit getting slammed on the floor by the PO I've seen on other docu's, never knew it was him. "
Time: The Kalief Browder Story,The looming threat of a WGA strike was also a motivation for getting scripts in early I'll bet.
Time: The Kalief Browder Story,If only they had that foresight with the sequel trilogy. Can you imagine writing a script knowing that it had to relate to other projects? Crazy.
Time: The Kalief Browder Story,I do not want to watch 4 other trash shows just to understand the one I kind of like
Time: The Kalief Browder Story,"Question is does it ""fit perfectly"" without watching ahsoka and ""more star wars series""?"
Time: The Kalief Browder Story,"Long time ago in a tiny galaxy far, far away..."
Time: The Kalief Browder Story,"FFS why. The MCU model is absolutely exhausting, I don't want keeping up with characters and shows I like to be a full time fucking job."
Time: The Kalief Browder Story,"Considering how heavily Favreau relies on improv, and how sparse I found any of the dialogue in Mando season 2 or Book of Boba Fett, I'm gonna take ""already written"" with a grain of salt"
Time: The Kalief Browder Story,Is anyone pretending it is a particularly elaborate show to write. The show just repeats itself ...
Time: The Kalief Browder Story,Please stop Marvel-izing Star Wars.
Time: The Kalief Browder Story,Meaning it's going to be further bogged down by having to connect to the Skywalker storyline. I'm one of the few who did not enjoy the Luke revelation at the end of S2: Does every single piece of Star Wars have to be bound to the OG Story?
Time: The Kalief Browder Story,">  So That Its Story Fits Perfectly With ‘Ahsoka’ and More ‘Star Wars’ Series

BWHAHA and by fits in, they mean works in an add for that other Disney shit thing."
Time: The Kalief Browder Story,"I'm kinda annoyed because I only want to watch Mando. Didn't see Boba and now people say that is important for season 3, now they say I need to watch even mlre shows. Might drop it completely"
Time: The Kalief Browder Story,"I guess that means we won't get back to the simple (in the best of meanings) and fun space western version of ""lone wolf and cub"" that was the first season."
Time: The Kalief Browder Story,But will it entertain?
Time: The Kalief Browder Story,"Unless the ""More"" is Andor, I don't care, I'm not watching other lazily produced shows just so I can understand what is going on in another.  I'd rather just read about the plot connections on a wiki or skip it entirely."
Time: The Kalief Browder Story,I love this sub because of all the miserable people who watch these things and then claim to hate it or call it pedantic but then they keep watching it.
Time: The Kalief Browder Story,Aha yes more product placement written into the show instead of you know telling a fucking story.
Time: The Kalief Browder Story,The whole universe is an inconsistent mess at this point. Making this little piece fit makes little difference.
Time: The Kalief Browder Story,So Ashoka will be another Book of Boba Fett and become Mandalorian season 4.5?
Time: The Kalief Browder Story,"Instead of 1 great show,they'll milk this into 5 ok shows."
Time: The Kalief Browder Story,imagine caring about this baby shit after Andor
Time: The Kalief Browder Story,Just stop.
Time: The Kalief Browder Story,Oh great more shows that connect together for no reason just because they're in the same franchise
Time: The Kalief Browder Story,Star Warzzzzzzzzzz…
Time: The Kalief Browder Story,"""Stop! Stop! He's already dead!"""
Time: The Kalief Browder Story,Please just no more putting other shows randomly within others like they did with BoBF
Time: The Kalief Browder Story,Already stopped watching Mandalorian when the Bobba Fett filler shit started. Why does everything need to be connected. its a story about a GALAXY far far away. give me more of the galaxy and less of the same ol shit
Time: The Kalief Browder Story,"Am I the only one who is not a fan of having to watch other series so that the series that I am watching makes sense?

My wife and I used to watch The Flash and every season they'd do a crossover episode with the various other shows on that network. It was awful to have to watch those other shows to know what was up so we just started skipping the crossovers altogether. 

I like the Mandalorian but not interested in the other shows so I hope that while it will fit with other shows, I won't have to watch those others just to have an episode make sense."
Time: The Kalief Browder Story,How about writing it so it fits with original series episodes 4-6?
Time: The Kalief Browder Story,But Andor is still the only one worth watching…
Time: The Kalief Browder Story,"No more Ahsoka, please..."
Time: The Kalief Browder Story,"Fuck the haters, I’m excited. Mando is going to mandalore. There’s going to be a big conflict around the mandalore title since Bo wants it too. Ahsoka is going with Sabine to find Ezra and Thrawn. Thrawn is likely going to be the big villain, which should be awesome. Or will Ezra have turned him? Or will he have turned Ezra? Will the next mandalore reunite the Mando clans against Thrawn? Will Bo become mandalore and fail again, this time siding with Thrawn? Who knows, but I want to find out."
Time: The Kalief Browder Story,This is such a miserable sub.
Time: The Kalief Browder Story,This sucks
Time: The Kalief Browder Story,So will we have to watch Ahsoka to understand season 4?
Time: The Kalief Browder Story,"I have no hopes for Ahsoka. Dangling Thrawn in front of the old fans is not enough, and Ahsoka as a person is the most boring, straight-lacedm personality-free White-Hat Cowboy heroine in all of Star Wars. No sense of humor, no undercurrents. Leia had oceans more personality because she actually gets angry and is a good strategist."
Time: The Kalief Browder Story,"That sounds like a lot of fucking Star Wars, maybe too much"
Time: The Kalief Browder Story,They’re setting up Ezra to take over Grogus Jedi training.
Time: The Kalief Browder Story,Too much stars wars content.  Burned me out
Time: The Kalief Browder Story,I don’t know why they’re doing this. I liked the mandalorian but I’m never gonna watch season 3 because I can’t finish the Boba Fett show. Would likely be the same with Ashoka tbh.
Time: The Kalief Browder Story,"Weird, it’s not like SW fans are anal about lore or anything…"
Time: The Kalief Browder Story,"I feel like I’m the only person happy with everything so far, BOBF was the worst show, but I still enjoyed it, and I love how the shows come together. I also completely don’t understand how people think there are too many shows"
Time: The Kalief Browder Story,The hype is utterly dead for this and anything else Star Wars related
Time: The Kalief Browder Story,Why can’t Disney ever just a Star Wars series be it’s own separate thing. They always have to ruin it by mixing it with others or by bringing back the sky walkers. Really annoying tbh.
Time: The Kalief Browder Story,I thought they were supposed to just make that shit up as they go along. Somehow Grogu returned….
Time: The Kalief Browder Story,I don't want to watch anymore Starwars or Marvel and its sad as they used to be some of my fav universes.
Time: The Kalief Browder Story,Too bad none of them even come close to being as good as Andor
Time: The Kalief Browder Story,This should definitely be the way.
Time: The Kalief Browder Story,Let's a go!
Time: The Kalief Browder Story,Quality over quantity people Liam Neeson was right about the franchise being watered down
Time: The Kalief Browder Story,Only a Sith Deals in Absolutes
Time: The Kalief Browder Story,"It would be nice to see on the news

“The Mandalorian Season 5 is already written so that it’s story fits perfectly with the season Premier of ‘Luke Skywalker’ series” !"
Time: The Kalief Browder Story,Ugh
Time: The Kalief Browder Story,"Kind of wish they did a trilogy of movies or hell, even a single movie. Star Wars has always thrived with the spectacle of a theater experience. Avatar and others have seemed to fill in that gap in the theater and now Star Wars shows are designated to a Disney+ MCU knock off without the character development that you'd think a long form format would contain. Mandalorian is alright, but all the others have been subpar at best."
Time: The Kalief Browder Story,"Here is hoping for time travel / dimensional shenanigans to reset the world ..lol.

Yes i know it wont happen they are going to another galaxy to build a new world/ story they control outside of all existing history ...."
Time: The Kalief Browder Story,So they have a…plan.
Time: The Kalief Browder Story,Something I had zero concerns about
Time: The Kalief Browder Story,…so why didn’t you do this for the sequel trilogy?
Time: The Kalief Browder Story,"Will probably go Mando 3 -> Ahsoka -> Boba Fett 2 -> Mando 4

A potential Obi Wan 2 would be mostly stand alone at this point. 

I for one am excited to watch all these."
Time: The Kalief Browder Story,It would seemed they have learned something from the sequel trilogy
Time: The Kalief Browder Story,This is the way.
Time: The Kalief Browder Story,"This is the way. Not like the travesty the sequels were. Like them or hate them, no one can argue that they were well planned in advance."
Time: The Kalief Browder Story,Just so long as I don't have to watch another show to get Din's story. I hate this tangled web of crisscrossing shows because some are good and some are garbage. They should stay separate.
Time: The Kalief Browder Story,This is going to turn into a Star Wars Averngers two movie ending.
Time: The Kalief Browder Story,But the fact that it didn’t fit perfectly with other shows is part of what made it great 😞
Time: The Kalief Browder Story,Star Wars fatigue.
Time: The Kalief Browder Story,What episodes of Boba Fett do I have to watch to understand Mando season 3?
Time: The Kalief Browder Story,Star Wars should always have a fucking plan I’m not applauding them for starting to do what they’re suppose to do in the first place
Time: The Kalief Browder Story,[Endless trash!](https://youtu.be/Ut5sk0RUlS4)
Time: The Kalief Browder Story,Boooooo!
Time: The Kalief Browder Story,Ok but I'd rather not watch those.
Time: The Kalief Browder Story,I hope Andor S2 doesn't fit shit.
Time: The Kalief Browder Story,This… is concerning.
Time: The Kalief Browder Story,Just like how “Kenobi” fits perfectly by having Obi Wan hang around 10 year old Leia and then that’s never mentioned again in the movies? Gtfo here. Nothing is connected antmore
Time: The Kalief Browder Story,I know people hate it but I love that The Book of Boba Fett and other 1-2 season short stories are baked into the storyline. It makes the system seem very dynamic with lots of these little things going on at the same time.
Time: The Kalief Browder Story,They’re taking more care planning the Mandalorian/Star Wars TV verse than they did the damn sequel trilogy.
Time: The Kalief Browder Story,Ron burgundy: “ I don’t believe you.”
Time: The Kalief Browder Story,"Still processing GOT trauma, this head line soothes a tv loving soul."
Time: The Kalief Browder Story,Oh my god who fucking cares. Can we please be done with valuing our entertainment by how well designed it is to suck us into a brand
Time: The Kalief Browder Story,*sigh*
Time: The Kalief Browder Story,"I have lost all hope entirely for disney and star wars.

Literally the only thing i enjoy besides the mandalorian is bad batch"
Time: The Kalief Browder Story,"Please don't make Ahsoka be The Mandalorian season 3.5  

I like Mando and Ahsoka and it was cool they met a few times, but they don't have to have interlinked stories. Ahsoka's meant to be in the unknown regions with sabine finding Ezra and Thrawn, Mando's got his own stuff. The universe is huge.   

Have the Jedi academy be a kind of hub, characters from all shows might pop in or out but don't do serious plot progression like Grogu and Mando reuniting, or getting a new ship, in a different show and expect everyone to have watch the book of boba fett"
Time: The Kalief Browder Story,"what is the problem? of course they should be connected, that's the whole reason why they are having so many shows in the same timeline. Would be weird if they would never met again."
Time: The Kalief Browder Story,Is it going to be more or less boring ?
Time: The Kalief Browder Story,Trying to connect all the properties just ends in a mess. Learn from marvel Phase one and quit while you're ahead.
Time: The Kalief Browder Story,Another show where I have to watch a dozen hours of a different show to understand what's happening. Yay!
Time: The Kalief Browder Story,retcon retcon retcon
Time: The Kalief Browder Story,"The proliferation of all of these TV shows is how you deplete the hardcore fans. They can’t keep up, and because of it they lose interest. Their communities fall apart."
Time: The Kalief Browder Story,"Oh good, I was losing sleep."
Time: The Kalief Browder Story,"I do not care how any of this “connects”. That isn’t entertaining, it’s just a shallow way of placating viewers who care more about “consistency” than good storytelling. They are infantilizing their audience. 

The Mandalorian has never been an amazing show (it’s repetitive and stake-less), but the first season was a harmless distraction. Now it’s become the lynch pin for a bunch of other lazily made Star Wars “content”. This is all made more baffling if you’ve seen Andor which operates at a level of quality extremely far beyond the scope of the other shows.

Disney is so terrified of making any big moves with this thing that the stories now operate in this suffocating pressure chamber of bad “lore” it feels it has to adhere to and reinforce. It’s like sewing a seam but just keeps sticking the needle in and out of the same couple of centimetres of fabric and trying to see how many stitches it can fit in there."
Time: The Kalief Browder Story,"I’m glad I don’t let Reddit dictate what I should like or not like. This comment section is hilarious, I swear none of you actually like anything, you just use things to shit on other things. This show was gods gift to star wars, wasn’t it? Or was it just because you liked it more than the last jedi? Is Andor garbage too? Because you guys are saying that it’s better than mandalorian."
American Vandal,I’m rewatching it right now and couldn’t agree more. I think season 1 is probably more “tight” from start to finish but I think season 2 actually has more fleshed out social situations and commentary. Both are really fantastic in their own right
American Vandal,I still quote [Alex Trimboli](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6UkN_RTmzo) saying he *definitely* got a handjob all the time. 100 percent.
American Vandal,"I will argue that to this day, American Vandal is the most accurate representation of high school life I’ve ever seen. Every character, the dialogue, the situations, and how social media was used felt genuine and real."
American Vandal,"This show was so good. If you get over the initial concept of dick drawings, it’s a really well thought out “whodunnit”"
American Vandal,"This show was great and must have cost like nothing to make. A real bummer that they canceled. 

I also recently rewatched “Trial and Error”, another underrated true crime spoof of the era and highly recommend it if you can find it streaming anywhere (I was 🏴‍☠️)"
American Vandal,"Every time a ""what TV show got cancelled too soon"" thread pops up this is always my answer. This show struck such a good balance between dick humor and actually compelling mystery.

I remember hearing the creators of the show say they already had ideas for S3 when S2 dropped and I was so gutted we never got to see more"
American Vandal,This is a hill im willing to die on!! American Vandal was a masterpiece.
American Vandal,Unpopular opinion. Thought the second season was great!!
American Vandal,Watch the creators newest offering “Players” on paramount plus. A sports/esport mockumentary. It’s maybe not as funny but it definitely has heart. Very good. And one of the creators is a character in it. (BigNPaul if you watch)
American Vandal,This is the best thing Netflix has ever produced.
American Vandal,"The first season was so good. Don’t remember much about the second though, tbh."
American Vandal,Their new series about League of Legends was really good.
American Vandal,That first season was so good it was like Nathan Fielder levels of great.
American Vandal,I thought the second season was surprisingly insightful when it came to what it must be like growing up in the social media age. I even teared up at times because of the amount of empathy that was displayed for its characters. American Vandal is one of the best things Netflix ever did and it’s insane that they cancelled it.
American Vandal,I really enjoyed both seasons tbh.
American Vandal,"Hi, I’m Dylan Maxwell and this is breadfacing"
American Vandal,"Players is so good. It took me a few episodes to sink in deep, but it is one of my favorite shows this year and I’ve been watching A LOT of shows."
American Vandal,"Milk, milk, lemonade, around the corner..... Poop emoji is made."
American Vandal,"I had a coworker at a school I worked that would watch documentaries on Netflix in her free time. Any documentary she could find she’d check out

She did not realize American Vandal was a parody until she brought it up with me and I told her it wasn’t real. Regret not playing along"
American Vandal,"I think this show was great but I'm pretty fine with it being over. Not everything needs to be dragged out till it gets stale, having 2 really good seasons is fine."
American Vandal,"I loved both season, I just dont know how long the novelty of a mockumentary would wear off after 3-5 seasons"
American Vandal,Who did the dicks anyway? I forgot
American Vandal,"For anyone hungry for more mockumentaries like this, please check out the creators' other work, Players.

I think I like it just a little more than either season of American Vandal."
American Vandal,I loved this show and although the streaming service is subpar their new show on paramount is excellent.
American Vandal,It’s insane to think people still haven’t seen or heard of this show. It’s so fucking funny.
American Vandal,Jamie Patro is the shit.
American Vandal,This is funny seeing this because I just started my like fourth rewatch. I don’t think I’ll get sick of it and would gladly watch it with anyone who hasn’t seen it.
American Vandal,"One of the funniest shows I had ever seen and took me by complete surprise, my ex at the time showed it to me and I thought she was taking interest in a corny show. Glad I was wrong"
American Vandal,Just another day at Netflix
American Vandal,Who drew the dicks?
American Vandal,"I loved this show, season 2 in particular"
American Vandal,I would love to see an American Scandal doc about the cancellation of American Scandal.
American Vandal,Season 1 was a masterpiece. Season 2 was unnecessary.
American Vandal,They should reboot it and investigate the cancellation of the show. Like weird meta inception type shit
American Vandal,"The fact this show made me genuinely care about the implications of ball hair on a dick drawing goes to shoe how fantastic it was. It was crude and crass and stupid as fuck, but it was incredibly honest and one of the best portrayals of high school life in America I have ever seen."
American Vandal,"Players is the best show I've watched all year.  I've never played League of Legends, I think this show could be about literally abything I just love the format and the show.

I hope to death we get a season 2, they didn't fill in half the time line.

What happened to a Put-Putt!!!"
American Vandal,It was so good! I was so sad when I heard they cancelled it.
American Vandal,r/DickDrawings
American Vandal,"So was American Crime being cancelled which is top-tier flawless television. 

I loved season 1 of AV, I never finished season 2, not because it was bad, but idk it was a while ago. is it as good as season 1? Which I consider to be perfection."
American Vandal,Is that @Jimmy on IG??
American Vandal,"I thought both seasons were great, but I would hate to have seen it go downhill trying to make it more and more over the top. I think it stands pretty well on its own"
American Vandal,"I have watched this show FIVE times. Why? Because anytime a friend visits me for a weekend I tell them they have to watch this incredible show. Every. single. time. they fall in love with it and watch the entire thing.

It’s just that good."
American Vandal,Personally felt season 2 was a bit desperate and didn't quite capture what season 1 had. But it was good
American Vandal,Loved this series. Was a shame to see it canceled. Each episode was better than the last.
American Vandal,This show is pure gold in my opinion and I can never understand why they cancelled this insanely enjoyable show.
American Vandal,I miss this show. It was so underrated and had me guessing who the suspects were
American Vandal,"My husband and I frequently quote: “I lie about all kinds of stuff. Like I told everyone I understood ‘inception.’”

So funny."
American Vandal,Season 1 was a masterpiece. I want a fan of the second season though
American Vandal,"I loved this shit. My favorite lines : 
""Hey, did you eat my fries?""   I mean, yeah....
and ""You have to draw the ballhair, it's like the most important part"""
American Vandal,It was so good at parodying the genre while still telling a good story.
American Vandal,"Truly needs more attention, shit was hilarious"
American Vandal,Netflix have cancelled a lot of great shows. This is a big reason why their business isn’t doing so great right now.
American Vandal,Literally just rewatched this for the third time. It’s so good and the performances are next level.
American Vandal,"Season 1 was great, 2 was good but didn't finish it. I saw the first 4 or 5 episodes of Players and thought it was funny, but the novelty wore off fast for me."
American Vandal,"The show would have been terrible if they tried to keep it going.  The second season was already a significant step down from the first,  and a third would have likely took what was already a pretty thin premise past its breaking point. 

The show ending is about as far from being a crime as it could be, having it continue would have likely been a bigger mistake if it meant spoiling its legacy."
American Vandal,Meh
American Vandal,The trailer was the funniest part of the show. It wasn’t sustainable past the first episode.
American Vandal,"First season was great, but should have been a one and done series anyway. Second season was completely unnecessary."
American Vandal,"The crime is how the concept of this show was stolen from a submission me and my friends entered into a high school film competition in 2016 >:(

Excellent show tho it should have way more seasons"
American Vandal,it was good half way through one season. I can list a shitload of scifi that deserved more seasons way more than this show.
American Vandal,The 1st season of American Vandal is in my top 5 favorite things Netflix has ever produced.
American Vandal,Shoulda happened after season 1 tbh
American Vandal,"Wdym? It got two seasons, and the second wasn’t as good as the first

It had nowhere left to go."
American Vandal,Trash tv.
American Vandal,The only crime was the second season after a killer first one
American Vandal,8====D
American Vandal,It is one of my favorites I watch it around New Years every year
American Vandal,Just finished a rewatch of this a few weeks ago. I really miss it
American Vandal,Til there is a show with this title out there.
American Vandal,Just watch Players. It’s their new mocumentary and it’s honestly better than American Vandal.
American Vandal,No. The JCS Youtube channel having to call it due to bullshit account strikes was a true crime. To true crime.
American Vandal,"Man, that show was brilliant! And like, it would have been perfect for the ""one episode a week"" release model that a lot of streaming shows are doing now. I would have loved more seasons, maybe they could have even done a season taking place at a college."
American Vandal,This show was childish but God damnit they went hard into the humor of this and it was hilarious
American Vandal,"It was funny, it was a compelling mystery, and it had something to say. 

It’s really a shame we didn’t get another season."
American Vandal,Players is one of my favorite shows of the year & I don’t even play League. These guys are just good at making TV.
American Vandal,"I'm so glad this is brought up, without a doubt American Vandal is the best show to come off Netflix ever"
American Vandal,"Is this the show with the ""found footage"" of an entire school having the shits?"
American Vandal,"So, the cancellation was vandalism?"
American Vandal,"They made the show ""Players"" last year which is a mockumentary on Pro League of Legends, and gaming.  It's amazing.  Definitely recommend to any fans of American Vandal."
American Vandal,show was a masterpiece
American Vandal,"After he hits the blunt then gets hit with bad news

“Now im upsettingly high”

BRO IVE TOTALLY BEEN THERE YOURE JUST LIKE: 😮‍💨😑🫤"
American Vandal,Yoooooo is that Xander???
American Vandal,Players better not meet the same fate!
American Vandal,"Ummm, season 2 was even better? This is why people don’t trust critics."
American Vandal,"Bring this show BACK, and STOP cancelling shows before most of my friends have a chance to watch them. 

Netflix, ffs, get with the program."
American Vandal,Been a fan of Jimmy Tatro for aomost a decade! Dude is hilarious and his YouTube with it friend Christian have always put out great content. American Vandal was hilarious and somewhat moving at the end.
American Vandal,"It's not ""true crime"" based, but another mockumemtary I enjoyed just as much recently was Players on Paramount Plus. It had the same level of cringe and detailed story-telling that you couldn't stop watching."
American Vandal,"The creators also made a new mocuseries called ""players"" about a group of kids playing League of Legends. It is also great."
American Vandal,Love this show
American Vandal,"One thing i've been surprised to not see in this discussion is just how well it did at picking apart the problems with a lot of true crime stuff.  That first season, especially, really captured what made me uncomfortable with a lot of aspects around the serial podcast(which i loved) and the sort of cult around it and how they trivialize, to an extent, the fact that real people with real lives are involved and impacted."
American Vandal,Jimmy Tatro is a goddamn treasure.
American Vandal,Good title
American Vandal,The creators of the show recently released a sports mocumentary called “Players” on Paramount+. It follows an exports team. It's really great.
American Vandal,"No, how bad the second season was compared to the first is the real crime.  It deserved to be cancelled."
American Vandal,"Unless it was an actual god damn true crime, then this article and headline are shit"
American Vandal,"this, breaking bad, and better call saul are the only shows my dad and I enjoy together lmao"
American Vandal,Yeah and Player's is to cringe for me
American Vandal,"The actor, Jimmy Tatro, is actually pretty solid. He’s typecasted as a dimwitted frat guy, but he does it very well. Another series I wish he would continue work on is “The Real House Bros of Simi Valley” that has 3 seasons, but I imagine Tanner Petulla (aka media producer/DJ, Getter) is probably busy with many other projects"
American Vandal,Bring it  back!!!
American Vandal,"Honestly I disagree. The first season was amazing. The second was ok.

That's it, it didn't need 10 seasons, each season another new crime.  It was perfect as it was."
Son of Zorn,I LOVED that show! I thought it was unique as fuck and super funny!
Son of Zorn,I too loved this short lived show :(
Son of Zorn,There was no comedy unless Zorn was on the screen so I ended up fast forwarding through the Zornless parts in the second half of the season.
Son of Zorn,"Tim Meadows and Zorn were golden, the boss lady was also very enjoyable imho. It was mainly the son of Zorn that was boring, I've said this before and I'll say it again - they should've made ""Zorn"" not ""Son of Zorn""."
Son of Zorn,"I think the storylines involving the son, and his rejection of his father and heritage were poor and boring. We've seen that story play out so many times, and it just isn't very fun."
Son of Zorn,Wish they'd have given it an extra season at least. It was loads of fun.
Son of Zorn,"Cheryl Hines was a horrible casting. Every other character outshone her and her comedic timing was really poor.


With a funnier actress to play off Zorn, it would've been a bigger hit. Someone like Natalie Zea from The Detour."
Son of Zorn,I don't know if the show had more than one season and I may not have seen every last episode but damn if it wasn't hilarious when it was on.  May be destined to be a cult classic someday.
Son of Zorn,"I still regularly think about the episode where Zorn is playing the harmonica from Blues Traveler's ""Run-Around""."
Son of Zorn,son of zorn is so good. almost all the shows that I like have been taken off of tv relatively quickly
Son of Zorn,"The cast were already pretty 'flanderized' from the get-go, would be hard to improve on."
Son of Zorn,"I was pretty happy with all the supporting cast, personally. Tim Meadows is comedy garlic in the kitchen, makes anything better."
Son of Zorn,"Whenever Zorn isn't on the screen, all the other characters should be asking ""Where's Zorn?"""
Son of Zorn,That was a mistake. Tim Meadows is hilarious.
Son of Zorn,That's not how flanderization works.
Son of Zorn,"He is such a underappreciated actor. If you watch Brooklyn 99, he's so amazing as a guest character on that show."
Son of Zorn,"The rest of the cast was fine, the writing for them was not."
Son of Zorn,Zorn died on the way back to his home planet.
Son of Zorn,His role in B99 is hilarious lmao. He was great in Popstar as well.
Son of Zorn,"So far, I'd say it has potential. This episode isn't all that great. I've laughed a couple times but not enough that if this is as good as it gets I'd keep watching.

However it isn't like every show is good from the first episode. It has more promise than I thought it would.

Edit: Lol, that death hawk bit sold this for me. I'm watching the next episode."
Son of Zorn,This is actually pretty funny.
Son of Zorn,"I was going to criticize FOX for airing the premiere on a night with no other new programming on their network, but they did give Son of Zorn a pretty massive lead-in with this being the first Sunday of the NFL season. Not sure what to make of their choice in scheduling."
Son of Zorn,"Damn, that woman as Zorn's boss joke was really funny. "
Son of Zorn,"To me, this feels like Space Ghost in real life and I love it. A lot of Zorn's one liners are fantastic and delivered in a similar way. "
Son of Zorn,Okay ended strong defenitly will watch the next episode 
Son of Zorn,"Was on the edge until the ending part with the hawk, and will definitely check out the rest of the season. Part of me wishes this was on a different network or time slot where they could push the envelope just a bit more. I feel they had to keep alot of the humor options neutered with it being on a major network during a prime showing time earlier in the evening."
Son of Zorn,"It was alright. I've invested more time in worse shows, so I'll give the next episode a shot to see if it gets any better. Did anybody else find it odd that they aired an ad for the series premier two weeks from tonight?"
Son of Zorn,"Maybe I'm simple-minded and juvenile, but I enjoyed this quite a bit. And I intend to enjoy however many episodes they get. "
Son of Zorn,This is going to be the worst show ever made or pretty funny. I don't see much room for in between
Son of Zorn,"Well, so far this is really just a clinic in how acting to empty space looks awkward as fuck."
Son of Zorn,"Me, my brother, and my dad were cracking up during the scene with the giant bird. The high list of the episode was definitely ""But Edie, the drought!""

Not the best thing I've ever seen, but that scene definitely will keep me going for another episode."
Son of Zorn,"This just isn't working. Im giving it all I got but im just not amused so far.

"
Son of Zorn,Really bland. Doesn't help that the acting is awkward as fuck. But the writing and humor is soooooo bland.
Son of Zorn,I get the distinct impression that none of the cast thinks this is going to be a long-term gig.
Son of Zorn,"I generally like it idea, use a masters of the universe knock off as a substantive for a soldier coming home and readjusting with society. Reconnect with the son, and wife. It could be better if Zorn had some sort of Zephira Version of PTSD, but that is only lightly hinted at with that conference table taking a hit or two. I think that the usually folly of network TV happened, the network executives pulling the series teeth, it's edge, because of sponsors. Same thing with with the violet blood at the start of the premiere. It's kinda okay, but that's about it."
Son of Zorn,"A lot of people are arguing that this show should be on a different, less restrictive network. I have to disagree. Network TV has been stale for a long time now. What scripted series' are people still watching on those channels? The Simpson's? Not for the last ten years. Family Guy? Maybe until you turn 16. Modern Family? Been beating a dead horse for the last five years. Big Bang? An outdated form of series. Insert procedural cop show here. I haven't been compelled by a show on network television since Community was cancelled by NBC. FOX is looking to the future by experimenting with their new comedies, Brooklyn Nine-Nine and Last Man, and now Zorn. People may not enjoy *all* of these new experimental series, I certainly don't, but these risks are a good sign for the future. Now we have to wait for NBC and CBS, and for dramatic television on networks to become less cookie-cutter. I welcome these new, more creative shows. Network TV should be able to compete with cable TV in terms of contents, and they can't use FCC restrictions, no matter how unpopular, as an excuse."
Son of Zorn,Far better than I thought it would be.  Really seems like it might be ok.
Son of Zorn,Quite enjoyed the pilot. Had me chuckling pretty consistently. Love Sudeikis and Meadows. Thought Artemis killed it too. Big fan of Johnny Pemberton but I'm not sure if he's going to have much of the comedic moments in the series. I'm sold and will continue to tune in as long as it a least maintains this standard.
Son of Zorn,"Oh, incidentally, motion to rename Cheryl Hines ""Discount Elizabeth Banks""?"
Son of Zorn,"I liked the 1st ep just enough, to give the 2nd a shot. Hope it doesn't disappoint. "
Son of Zorn,It's weird that a thirty-something year old man is playing Zorn's high school age son
Son of Zorn,"Want to give this a chance, but just can't get through this episode.  Next."
Son of Zorn,"Kept expecting Susie to pop up and say ""Fuck you Zorn!"""
Son of Zorn,[deleted]
Son of Zorn,Hi liked Cheryl Hines in it.
Son of Zorn,I'm on board with thinking this show has great potential so I'm gonna stick with it and hope it picks up with the jokes and laughs.
Son of Zorn,It's okay. A few chuckles. I'll give it three or four episodes till I decide to keep or drop.
Son of Zorn,Lol when his son gets cut in half
Son of Zorn,Has this concept ever worked....... 
Son of Zorn,it was a good try.  but don't think it worked.
Son of Zorn,"Off-brand archer, basically."
Son of Zorn,[removed]
Son of Zorn,Should I give this show a chance? The advertisements I've seen don't really appeal to me at all. Is it better than that?
Son of Zorn,"Man with smallest genitalia dies, world rejoices.
There are some great 1 liners."
Son of Zorn,"Looking at the other comments, I thought I was the only one enjoying this so far."
Son of Zorn,I am pleasantly surprised by this. The animation is working great with everything else.
Son of Zorn,[deleted]
Son of Zorn,I watched the whole show when I wouldn't have so I'd say it was a good decision.
Son of Zorn,Pretty sure that's code for Fox is canceling this show no matter what so it doesn't make any different when they put it on.
Son of Zorn,Don't you mean man?
Son of Zorn,"Yeah, I haven't watched it yet but I instantly got a Space Ghost Coast to Coast vibe from the trailer. "
Son of Zorn,I used to love Space Ghost until I went to a Dragon Con panel featuring George Lowe (voice of SG).  Ugh.  There are no words for what a jerk he is.
Son of Zorn,"Yeah that ending was better than the rest of the episode combined.

If they can channel that humor for a full episode I'd love it."
Son of Zorn,This show would be great for adult swim 
Son of Zorn,It'll be a cult favorite. Or it'll blow up like Bob's Burger
Son of Zorn,Why couldn't they just have a stand-in? I don't get it.
Son of Zorn,"That could be because its the pilot.

Pilots are strange beasts.

People seem to quickly be spoiled by shows like Game of Thrones or anything netflix does.

They buy whole seasons at a time and just let the creative people do their thing.

A pilot like this though is a grab bag."
Son of Zorn,"""Bland"" is the exact word I was looking for. I was surprised by how boring this felt, which is odd considering the premise. And I agree with you about the acting, everyone felt SUPER stiff. I'll give it another shot with the hope that it gets better...but yeah, not a promising start."
Son of Zorn,"This show has a lot going against it.  On top of it being a premise with a pretty narrow potential fan base, the actual production is difficult.  I watched their panel from SDCC.  The process is insane.  They storyboard the episode, write the script, rehearse it.  Then all the live actors get a chance to improvise lines, including the guy standing in for Zorn.  They film it with the improvisations and change the script for Sudakis.  Then *he* gets to play around and improvise while he's recording vocals.  *Then* they get the final animation to match all of that planned and unplanned dialog and story.  That feels like it could cost a lot and add considerable delays to the final product."
Son of Zorn,"It could be PTSD or it could just be him learning how to behave in polite society.  The showrunners describe Zephira as a place ""in constant warfare.""  You would obviously act differently in each society."
Son of Zorn,"How exactly is Brooklyn Nine-Nine experimenting with anything? Its a cop sitcom. Dont get me wrong, i think its pretty good, but its just a sitcom. "
Son of Zorn,"> I haven't been compelled by a show on network television since ~~Community~~ Parks and Recreation was cancelled by NBC

Parks was cancelled/ended afterwards, so *that* was the end of network TV"
Son of Zorn,Pretty bad when you feel awkwardness watch others do something.
Son of Zorn,[your references](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/236x/0b/5f/67/0b5f6794c6c32f7c94cffd8f68d1a325.jpg)
Son of Zorn,"I just thought of her as Dallas from Suburgatory, having watched Curb after without realizing it was her.
"
Son of Zorn,Her character in suburburgatory was quite different but I agree here. 
Son of Zorn,it's not worth a watch for now but the show has potentiel to be good.
Son of Zorn,"Yeah same, I mean I could see the shotty interacting with no one but it didn't bother me. "
Son of Zorn,"""That's the problem with these older ones. They don't want to die so they just..*stabstabstab*..won't!"""
Son of Zorn,Indeed.  They're giving it a good chance with such a lead in instead of sending it straight to the dead zone of friday night
Son of Zorn,"Nope, Fox has complete confidence in this show which is why they chose to air it right after a program with guaranteed high ratings"
Son of Zorn,"The actor who plays the son said that after he read the script his reaction was, ""that was cool, it will never be made."""
Son of Zorn,Budget is too high for adult swim
Son of Zorn,That's what I *hope* happens. Id like to see it succeed. I really enjoy it. 
Son of Zorn,"[They did, so there isn't really an excuse](http://www.avclub.com/article/son-zorn-featurette-asks-you-use-your-imagination-241865)"
Son of Zorn,"Personally, I don't like Brooklyn Nine-Nine. You are right that it is a sitcom, but I don't believe it is a traditional type of sitcom, such as Big Bang. It's kind of like scrubs I guess, but not as good. It uses overly goofy humor in a situation where it would seem very out-of-place in the real world. I can't think of anything like that on network TV right now, although I may be wrong. It stands out in a sea of bland. "
Son of Zorn,"True. I loved Parks, although I didn't get why it had to be in a documentary format."
Son of Zorn,"Maybe he doesn't like parks as much as Community? Personally, I think Community is up there with Arresed dev. as the best sitcom ever. While Parks started spinning its wheels a little towards the end (although it was absolutely fantastic from season 2-5). "
Son of Zorn,He doesn't own a TV and has several restraining orders pending from people in his neighborhood.
Son of Zorn,That same link shows that the stand-in was there rehearsing and then they were acting against empty space though.
Son of Zorn,"It's a single camera, half hour comedy.  Back when MASH did that, it was seriously edgy.  Sports Night made it cool again.  

In terms of humor, B99 relies on the common ""cringe"" humor that is so popular now.  Thankfully, they mostly restrict that cringe humor to the Jake character who, despite his Emmy win, I think is the weakest character (actor?) on the show.  We basically have Ricky Gervais to thank for all this cringe humor today.  His version of The Office was brilliant.  But all the knock-offs are tiresome."
Son of Zorn,"I mean, Big Bang is a VERY traditional sitcom, now adays brooklyn is more traditional type. "
Son of Zorn,"While I agree with you that Season 7 of Parks wasn't that great, the overall quality of the show was streets ahead of the current network TV programming. Even if you didn't care for it - you have to admit that."
Son of Zorn,"Please don't use streets ahead to refer to Parks and Rec.  Please limit that to: Community, Sports Night, MASH and Arrested Development.  "
Son of Zorn,"I don't want to make it seem like i didn't care for parks. I thought it was amazing for most of its run. Spinning its wheels doesn't necessarily mean i hated it, as much as it didn't really leave me laughing out loud or compelled as much as i just kinda sat there enjoying likable characters quip on screen. 

It is better than current network programming. There is literally not a single network show that i can think of right now that i'm watching. Yes, i'm watching The Walking Dead, but that's mostly due to a sunk cost fallacy, that show is awful. "
Son of Zorn,"The Walking Dead is cable, not network TV. There's no good shows on network TV anymore."
Son of Zorn,"My bad, i reread and still agree. "
Son of Zorn,Well shit. I enjoyed Making History but was pretty sure it was dead on arrival. Son of Zorn never really lived up to its potential and was just always kind of mediocre. 
Son of Zorn,All of the freshman time travel shows have now been canceled. I'm guessing we won't see another wave of that subgenre for awhile. 
Son of Zorn,I think it's pretty much established that if it doesn't take place in a hospital it has limited chance of survival. 
Greenhouse Academy,"Hello, I'm one of the rare 7 people in the universe who actually watch Greenhouse Academy. Where's my prize?"
Greenhouse Academy,I don't even know what this is.
Greenhouse Academy,"I watched season #1, but even the cast couldn't entice me back for more - that was a very milquetoast show, even for the tween set..."
Greenhouse Academy,Another fan U_U
Greenhouse Academy,Yeah where's mine coughs𝘄𝗮𝘁𝗰𝗵𝗲𝗱 𝗶𝘁 9 𝘁𝗶𝗺𝗲𝘀
Greenhouse Academy,"There really is not much talk about this show on reddit, at all. Even the subreddit is pretty quiet. I understand why it never got super popular though.

It's more like old-school nickelodeon with sometimes cheesy acting, but hey they're short episodes and it's enjoyable enough once you get use to it, if you want to give the first two seasons a go. It's more for a younger audience though. And they filmed S3/S4 back to back so I mean if you like it, there will be a fourth season!"
Greenhouse Academy,"Finally! I randomly started watching this one lazy Sunday and was hooked. I'm far beyond the target audience (I'm old) but it hit me with waves of nostalgic feelings for those old Nickelodeon live action shows. 

If you're a ""hollywood is RUINING my childhood...!"" kind of person then you should watch this."
Greenhouse Academy,[removed]
Greenhouse Academy,"There is a article on Deadline that explains why this is so common. Basically the way Netflix writes its contracts if a show goes past 3 seasons there are big pay bumps so the shows become to expensive at that point.

Greenhouse Academy,13 reasons... Why...?
Greenhouse Academy,Big Mouth has been renewed up to season 6 too.
Greenhouse Academy,[deleted]
Greenhouse Academy,"Castlevania has also been renewed for season 4! Also Dragon Prince has been renewed through the planned series finale (~7 seasons) (this tends more towards teen than kids I would say). While they may not have pushed many shows past 3 seasons, it's striking the diversity in genre and style."
Greenhouse Academy,[deleted]
Greenhouse Academy,"One of the things I find odd is that by cancelling a series that has an overarching story, they are removing all future value from it.  If the series finishes after a fourth season that doesn't perform super well, people will still watch and rewatch that series for many years to come because it's a complete story.  If they cancel it before it's finished, there will be no new or returning viewers."
Greenhouse Academy,"Also, Narcos. It is split into 3 of columbia and 2 of Mexico but, for all intents and purposes, is one series."
Greenhouse Academy,3% is in season 4.
Greenhouse Academy,"To be fair, there are a few where they were planned to be 3 or less, and where they actually got an ending. Like Dark.

But I'd love to see the number of shows they have which have been cancelled on cliffhangers or shitty endings. Bet it's a seriously significant number."
Greenhouse Academy,"You forgot ""She-Ra and the Princesses of Power"". Has 5 seasons and is a Netflix Original (albeit a reboot)"
Greenhouse Academy,God damnit Bojack Horseman was a great show
Greenhouse Academy,"So basically, ""I left out all the data that didn't support my point, here's the rest"""
Greenhouse Academy,"I was looking forward to The Society S2 and Teenage Bounty Hunters's renewal, so annoying that they cancelled these two. :/"
Greenhouse Academy,Also the Last Kingdom.
Greenhouse Academy,thx god for 6 seasons of bojack
Greenhouse Academy,"Anyone else doesn't really mind?? Most times 1 or 2 seasons is enough tbh, shows usually just fall off a cliff after that. 

I really think showrunners/writers/producers (whoever the fuck is incharge of decision making) should shake the habit of writing optimistic finales and make season finales more conclusive (even when there are more seaaons planned). Cliffhangers do not belong in this streaming era, and that applies to everywhere not just Netflix."
Greenhouse Academy,"3%, A Brazilian dystopian series produced by Netflix got a fourth season. Underappreciated."
Greenhouse Academy,Isn't the Last Kingdom an original?
Greenhouse Academy,Maybe 3 seasons is enough. A lot of shows I enjoyed started to fade after that third or fourth season. There are exceptions but not many.
Greenhouse Academy,"Looking at this list, it’s making me wonder how it compares to other networks the last 5 years."
Greenhouse Academy,Santa Clarita Diet should have been on that list
Greenhouse Academy,"Admittedly I haven't watched most of their originals so I don't know how many of the 3 season shows have actual endings vs leaving off on a cliffhanger, but more shows need to just have a set expiration date. Too many shows last way past their prime and there's kind of an appeal knowing you won't have to commit to something for like 10 years."
Greenhouse Academy,"You forgot The Chilling Adventures of Sabrina, currently at 3 seasons but the fourth is on its way. Cancelled at four though but still! 

Also isn’t Stranger Things season 4 currently in the works too?"
Greenhouse Academy,"Don't forget the international shows, like the originals made in Latin America and Spain:

Club de Cuervos, México (4 Seasons and 2 spin-offs)

La Casa de Papel, Spain (4 Seasons so far)

Las chicas del cable, Spain (5 Seasons)

3%, Brazil (4 Seasons)"
Greenhouse Academy,"If I could have picked 10 Netflix series to make it past 3 seasons, I definitely would not have picked The Ranch, Fuller House, 13 Reasons Why, or most of the other shows on that list"
Greenhouse Academy,Babylon Berlin S04 is coming.  A very good series.
Greenhouse Academy,Patriot Act?
Greenhouse Academy,"How many Netflix original series are there in total? And how many of those even deserved a second series, let alone 3 or more?"
Greenhouse Academy,This list is not complete and it makes me question if it's worth taking seriously.  Hasn't Dragon Prince made it past 3 seasons?  She-ra finished it's run (on schedule) after 3 seasons too and those are just completely off the top of my head examples.
Greenhouse Academy,"How many Netflix original series have there ever been? 50? 100? 1,000? I need this as a percentage!"
Greenhouse Academy,Why I rarely give Netflix originals a chance.
Greenhouse Academy,"This is a pretty inaccurate and useless post. If you discount foreign imports then you're pretty much ignoring 60% of Netflix Originals then.

Moreover, 3 seasons is the sweet spot for Netflix since they need to renegotiate contracts after that. Therefore they are much more likely to can a show once they reach 3 seasons. It's the reason why Narcos transitioned into Narcos:Mexico."
Greenhouse Academy,10 out of......?
Greenhouse Academy,"Even though I absolutely hate that BoJack Horseman ended, especially when I heard that [Raphael Bob-Waksberg
 wanted more seasons](https://www.indiewire.com/2019/10/bojack-horseman-creator-netflix-ends-series-more-years-1202186442/), this makes me really glad we still got six."
Greenhouse Academy,"So why aren't you including ""children's series""? I can't honestly think of any reason not to include them."
Greenhouse Academy,You're missing Voltron: Legendary Defender which has 8 Seasons.
Greenhouse Academy,money heist (house of paper) 5th and final season is renewed.
Greenhouse Academy,Eh you forgot about Narco’s?
Greenhouse Academy,"Maybe listing the series which were actually cancelled would be more infomative.

Some series were never planned to have 4 or more seasons (e.g. Dark)."
Greenhouse Academy,I'm pretty confident that The Dragon Prince and Big Mouth will both go past 4 series. I think i saw in July that Dragon Prince has basically been set in for 7 seasons.
Greenhouse Academy,"Bothers me that House of Cards, a show that should have been 3 tight seasons, Instead gets drawn out for a meandering 6 seasons, and yet shows that have actually decent writing, get cut short. Wtf is going on over there? It really does baffle me that they don't understand these shows have very little follow up value without proper endings. People only every half heartedly recommend shows that never end."
Greenhouse Academy,Voltron Legendary Defender went for 8 seasons
Greenhouse Academy,WTF there's 6 seasons of House of Cards? I stopped after Spacey got the axe  and season 3 was already not that good...
Greenhouse Academy,"I wonder what this means to show like Virgin River and Sweet Magnolias.

VR is currently shooting S3 (Netflix hasn’t officially renewed the show, which is also weird to me) and SM was renewed for a S2. 

Why the start shooting S3 of VR if S2 hasn’t even come out and it may flop terribly. At least the have plans for it, which I doubt."
Greenhouse Academy,Cobra Kai is fantastic!!
Greenhouse Academy,"I really don't think this would be such a big issue if creators knew how many seasons they were getting up front, or even if they were told when it was their last season like with BoJack. That way they could properly end it at the right time and we wouldn't be left on a cliff hanger forever."
Greenhouse Academy,"It's shocking to see it laid out like this but not surprising.  Syndication and the value of the back end keeps shows ""worth it"" for networks to renew past season 5.  But without it these shows just become more expensive over time for Netflix to diminishing returns in terms of subscriber growth.  Very interested to see if Amazon and D+ end up following the same pattern here."
Greenhouse Academy,"You didn't include Big Mouth, which I for sure wouldn't consider a kids series."
Greenhouse Academy,Chilling adventures of Sabrina is getting a fourth and final right?
Greenhouse Academy,I’m still salty about Santa Clarita Diet. What happened with Mr.ball legs?!?
Greenhouse Academy,House of cards should have ended after S2
Greenhouse Academy,Travels with My Father
Greenhouse Academy,Somebody Feed Phil season 4 is coming out soon!  Add it to the list!
Greenhouse Academy,Trailer park boys
Greenhouse Academy,And you can discount the first 4 because they preceded the way netflix currently operates - they were legacy
Greenhouse Academy,"Why are you guys not including other animated shows like She-ra (finished series with 5 seasons) and The Dragon Prince (3 seasons aired and 4 more ordered)

Edit: Just remembered that Voltron also fits this"
Greenhouse Academy,"Lucifer S4-6 were Netflix. If only they hadn't already said that 6 was definitely it, they would have made the list"
Greenhouse Academy,Bojack is king
Greenhouse Academy,Pretty sure the Netflix Degrassi had four seasons before it was canceled
Greenhouse Academy,"This should differentiate Netflix originals that are created and distributed by Netflix and ones that are distributed by Netflix but still owned by a production company. House of Cards is not sole ownership of Netflix, nor is OITNB, while shows like stranger things are entirely Netflix."
Greenhouse Academy,Hopefully castlevania gets a 4th
Greenhouse Academy,The first two seasons of greenhouse academy were so good
Greenhouse Academy,13 reasons why for one did not deserve that many.
Greenhouse Academy,"Shows that should not have been canceled

American vandel

Santa Clarita diet

Teenage bounty hunters

Dead to me

Mystery science theater 3000

Glow"
Greenhouse Academy,I just needed a third season out if Altered Carbon to make up for shitty season 2 and wrap up stories :(
Greenhouse Academy,The crown and mindhunter are the only shows I hope Netflix stays the fuck away from. I swear if those get cancelled I am going to be livid.
Greenhouse Academy,"In light of recent *G.L.O.W.* news, I decided only to include aired seasons. You never know what their next change of mind is gonna be. *The Crown* seems safe though."
Greenhouse Academy,"Season 4 premiers in November I think, so it's not being counted here.  Honestly this doesn't really tell anyone much.  Even if you ignore the fact that Netflix has really only been serious about producing original shows for 5 years; combining cancellations, shows that had proper conclusions, deals that fell through, COVID related cancellations, omitting series that are currently renewed for a 4th season and beyond and also omitting several animated series, is just lumping everything together to capitalize on the 'Netflix bad' sentiment.   
  
People shred Netflix over cancelling properties with low-viewership when no one does the same for Hulu (Chance, The Path, The First, Shut Eye, Hard Sun, etc.) or Prime (Sneaky Pete, The Patriot, JCVJ, Hand of God, Tin Star, Too Old to Die Young, etc.) or any others.  Streaming services and Networks cancel shows *all the time*.  Not to mention, some shows like The OA and Santa Clarita got mixed reception at *best* with plenty of people here commenting about how 'garbage' they were when they were on the air (people here loved to post about how 'terrible' Drew Barrymore was or state how they would never watch S2 of The OA because of the finale in S1), then they get cancelled and suddenly everyone acts appalled and they become these martyrs."
Greenhouse Academy,Not yet--don't jinx it!
Greenhouse Academy,Then why on Earth don't they just make planned 3 season shows?
Greenhouse Academy,They also kill off all value of the show by cancelling it. Who really starts watching a show that you know was cancelled on a cliff hanger? Even as a fan of a show rewatching it while knowing the disappointment of a cliff hanger/no ending just kills it for me. I wish they would at least give them a few episodes or something to try and give some kind of ending. Would build good faith in netflix original series that I think they have lost. Would also make it so you can actually pick the shows up after they ran their course and know it got at least some form of ending unlike most of netflixs shows.
Greenhouse Academy,"Non Google amp link  - http://deadline.com/2019/03/netflix-tv-series-cancellations-strategy-one-day-at-a-time-1202576297/amp/  

(apparently Google amp links are nasty)"
Greenhouse Academy,"Also noted that audiences tend to consume 3 seasons to be satisfied. IMO. 3 great, right seasons is better than 10 drawn out seasons."
Greenhouse Academy,"Most TV series contracts are like that, the difference is Netflix dont really gain more subscribers from having a 4th series of Glow compared to the cost where as CBS can increase ad prices for a 30 second spot in series 4 of whatever show they have that makes it that far in order to compensate themselves."
Greenhouse Academy,[deleted]
Greenhouse Academy,"4 seasons? Just how??? I’ve honestly thought it was a once off thing, considering the premise."
Greenhouse Academy,I enjoyed Season 1 and 2 but 3 was mediocre as they switched perspectives and I never finished season 4
Greenhouse Academy,">3 seasons... Why...?

-ftfy"
Greenhouse Academy,and it some how managed to get worse and worse each season.  S3 was rock bottom. I didnt think a show could sink lower.  And then came S4.
Greenhouse Academy,op excluded kids shows
Greenhouse Academy,"Fuller House was (it did end) a multi-camera sitcom with no stars in it. Those are cheap to make, quick to film and easy to manage, and I don't think buying the rights to Full House exactly broke the bank. Daredevil's a Marvel superhero action drama that features frequent visual effects, stunts, recognizable names like Rosario Dawson and Vincent D'Onofrio, a much longer and more demanding shoot, and some relatively heavy hitters on the crew (producers and writers from Lost, The Sopranos, Mad Men, Sons of Anarchy, those guys are expensive). The budget is probably 10 times higher, it has to do a lot better to justify itself. And Fuller House did pretty well with its primary target demographic. It's a cheesy comedy starring middle-aged women steeped in 80s/90s nostalgia and their cute kids, women over 40 reportedly ate it up."
Greenhouse Academy,Fuller House probably doesn't cost a lot to make.
Greenhouse Academy,"It's unbelievable that you guys don't understand that what Reddit thinks is good does not translate to what the population thinks is good to watch. American Vandal literally only appeals to teenagers or males in their early 20s, of course it is big on Reddit but not overall."
Greenhouse Academy,[removed]
Greenhouse Academy,I think Disney had a hand in canceling Daredevil so they could use the character.
Greenhouse Academy,You can't really compare the marvel shows as Netflix dumped them all once they realized Marvel was going to make shows tied to the MCU on their own service.
Greenhouse Academy,The cost to make Fuller House is trivial compared to Daredevil
Greenhouse Academy,Blame yourselves. Daredevil was canceled because it cost a lot and no one watched it. Y'all want daredevil? Watch it. Don't need to rag on other shows just because they actually have audiences. Obviously it's doin something right even if it's not the kind of show reddit will enjoy
Greenhouse Academy,wait...there isnt going to be season 3 of American vandal?
Greenhouse Academy,Fuller House is the shit. No need to hate.
Greenhouse Academy,"GLOW was renewed for Season 4 too, so maybe best not to count chickens before hatched..."

Fire Chasers,"4 part documentary series:

>Fire Chasers

>From the vast visual ferocity, to the earnest and emotional personal stories hidden behind the smoke, Fire Chasers takes viewers into the heart of California’s devastating recent wildfires alongside the brave men and women of Cal Fire and the Los Angeles County Fire Department. Their mission is to battle the flames that erupt during fire season, threatening wildlife, natural terrain, and tens of thousands of homeowners. Climate change, altered vegetation patterns, and an increase in fire-prone landscapes have multiplied those crises -- forcing firefighters across the state to confront epic disasters that cost lives, millions of dollars in damage, and a massive scarring of the Earth.

>Fire Chasers is a Netflix original documentary series produced by Appian Way, Stone Village Television, and Original Productions.

Should do a second season in Australia, both countries send firefighters to eachother during summers."

LEGO Elves: Secrets of Elvendale,It is an interesting show. I finished Season 2. I do want to see how Griff returns back to the present. It is like a never-ending chain of time-traveling disasters from altering the past.
LEGO Elves: Secrets of Elvendale,">Director Greg Yaitanes, who helmed the 10th hour of the Game of Thrones prequel's premiere season, talked about a fun switcheroo they had to pull for filming due to a COVID-19 scare. Elliott contracted the virus during filming, forcing the production to find the next obvious replacement: his twin brother Luke.

>”There's that scene, that big scene where Corlys [Steve Toussaint] comes down and they're putting the markers on the table and the messenger comes in. It was a shot over two days and then one got COVID,"" he adds. ""[Elliott] got COVID, so we swapped him out with his brother.""

>Adding to the confusion were the names of the actors versus the characters. There's Luke Tittensor, the actor who plays Arryk, and then there's Luke Velaryon, the character played by actor Elliot Grihault opposite actor Elliott Tittensor, who plays Erryk. ""The way this came to me was the game of telephone,"" the director jokes.

>Yaitanes notes ""that would've killed us"" if Luke hadn't been able to step in. ""We were just about to do all Emma's coverage and he is standing right next to [them],"" he says."
LEGO Elves: Secrets of Elvendale,[removed]
LEGO Elves: Secrets of Elvendale,"Erryk's crown scene remains on the highlights of the show for me thus far, as a bookreader. 

The smuggling of the crown out of King's Landing is practically a footnote in the book; after all it is just a crown.

But the show really gives the moment its full gravitas. 

Ser Erryk didn't just give her a crown, he was truly the first to recognize Rhaenyra as the Queen, the first to bend the knee. The first to swear the holiest of oaths to her.

At her weakest moment, full of doubts and burying the daughter she would never hold again, he broke his oath and betrayed his own blood because he knew Rhaenyra to be the only person worth serving.

Criston Cole may be the Kingmaker, but Ser Erryk is just as much the Queenmaker.

I can't wait for the heartwrench when the twins meet once more."
LEGO Elves: Secrets of Elvendale,"We've secretly replaced one of their regular Tittensor with Folgers Crystals, let's see if they notice."
LEGO Elves: Secrets of Elvendale,"Until reading this headline, I had just assumed it was one guy playing both roles using camera tricks. I guess budget-wise this makes more sense"
LEGO Elves: Secrets of Elvendale,"Honestly, switching around one Tittensor brother for another is just utterly Shameless..."
LEGO Elves: Secrets of Elvendale,Only just realized that's Carl from Shameless!
LEGO Elves: Secrets of Elvendale,"these two guys are one of the highlight of the last two episodes, which have been truly great compared to the slightly bumpy previous ones. They got the face, the physical presence and the attitude of real knights. MAN how I wanted Twin no.1 to kick fuckface Criston in the arse"
LEGO Elves: Secrets of Elvendale,Like how they switched the Olsen twins in Full House? Splendid.
LEGO Elves: Secrets of Elvendale,“This my brother Darryl and my other brother Darryl.”
LEGO Elves: Secrets of Elvendale,This is why you always hire twins
LEGO Elves: Secrets of Elvendale,Lmao!!!! I don’t know why this made me laugh so much but it did! Twins doing a Parent trap
LEGO Elves: Secrets of Elvendale,"Ahahahaha! I knew it!

When he showed up with the crown, I asked my hubs, who read the book, if the twins swapped because that was the brother. He thought I was an idiot."
LEGO Elves: Secrets of Elvendale,I thought this show time jumped into cancelation.
LEGO Elves: Secrets of Elvendale,Why is does it seem like every headline in this sub is about this show
LEGO Elves: Secrets of Elvendale,I didn't even notice that there were twins in the show.
LEGO Elves: Secrets of Elvendale,So what they totally replaced other characters with people who look nothing like them. I’m out
LEGO Elves: Secrets of Elvendale,[deleted]
LEGO Elves: Secrets of Elvendale,"They switched the main characters out a few episodes in, which is where I stopped watching. It's like trying to watch GoT through my phone while my kids play with Snapchat filters."
LEGO Elves: Secrets of Elvendale,"It's so weird how the upper class still treats COVID like the black plague when everyone has just accepted it as a part of our daily lives now.

Last time I had COVID my job actually told me to go home for the rest of the day but return back to work the next morning lol"
LEGO Elves: Secrets of Elvendale,Who cares? It’s a shit show.
LEGO Elves: Secrets of Elvendale,Two is one and one is none:)
LEGO Elves: Secrets of Elvendale,lols
LEGO Elves: Secrets of Elvendale,"Man, I finally watched the first episode. It is...definitely one of the shows of all time. I have no desire to watch any more. It's like the writers totally missed the point of GoT and thought the reason we liked the original show was because the gore made it edgy. Meanwhile everyone is telling me how awful Rings of Power is but I whipped through the first season in 3 days and want more."
LEGO Elves: Secrets of Elvendale,"I really had to restrain myself from turning this show off, but forced my way through it.  Finally got interesting in the final episode.

That giant dragon reminded me of that scene in GoT when Euron's enormous ship appeared out of the darkness and destroyed everything when he captured Yara. HotD is no GoT, that's for sure."
LEGO Elves: Secrets of Elvendale,Covid's still a thing in America?
LEGO Elves: Secrets of Elvendale,"They did what?!?!?!   No, no, NO.   Not like this.   

(stews nefariously, rubbing hands together) I don’t quite know how, but those fuckers are about to pay…."
LEGO Elves: Secrets of Elvendale,Who cares?!?
LEGO Elves: Secrets of Elvendale,"Awful show, very very very underwhelming. Jesus fucking Christ."
LEGO Elves: Secrets of Elvendale,Good thing the one who caught COVID had a copy lol
LEGO Elves: Secrets of Elvendale,THEYRE TWO DUDES
LEGO Elves: Secrets of Elvendale,I’ve been lied to!
LEGO Elves: Secrets of Elvendale,I heard they did the same thing with the Lannnister twins. Talk about dedication and smart way around the issue.....lol
LEGO Elves: Secrets of Elvendale,Reminds me of that chinese anime in which a guy performed at idol concerts in place of his twin sister.
LEGO Elves: Secrets of Elvendale,An i thought they just got them mixed up. They should have waited casting was broken due to this.
LEGO Elves: Secrets of Elvendale,"""Director Greg Yaitanes went on to say,  ""yeah so we got the idea from Back to the Future and Crispin Glover. Seemed like a good idea. """
LEGO Elves: Secrets of Elvendale,Huh??? Smart choice 🤷‍♂️
LEGO Elves: Secrets of Elvendale,fErryk conspiracy time baby!
LEGO Elves: Secrets of Elvendale,They secretly switched those characters no one had met before and I had no idea who they were.
LEGO Elves: Secrets of Elvendale,"This is really common with child actors, where twins will be cast in roles, especially infants and young children.

This is how the Olsen twins got started, both playing the same role in an 80's sitcom as toddlers."
LEGO Elves: Secrets of Elvendale,"It's charming how the confusing naming of characters in the story came to life in the reality of putting the show on. 

If they hate this, they should stay away from Russian naming conventions in Tolstoy/Dostoyevsky. Soo many petroviches."
LEGO Elves: Secrets of Elvendale,I wonder how often the twins did this in Harry Potter just for shits and giggles
LEGO Elves: Secrets of Elvendale,"wow, now people will start hiring twins just to have a backup xD"
LEGO Elves: Secrets of Elvendale,Vizzy T shall have your tongue!!
LEGO Elves: Secrets of Elvendale,They pulled a Mary Kate & Ashley Olsen?
LEGO Elves: Secrets of Elvendale,">There's Luke Tittensor, the actor who plays Arryk, and then there's Luke Velaryon, the character played by actor Elliot Grihault opposite actor Elliott Tittensor, who plays Erryk.

There has to have been a better way to structure this sentence. Lol."
LEGO Elves: Secrets of Elvendale,"TIL they're actual twins and not one guy playing both roles

I don't know why I assumed it was the latter"
LEGO Elves: Secrets of Elvendale,"That's really cool, though I have to ask-

Did Luke get paid for playing another character? I think the other brother didn't show up in that episode after all."
LEGO Elves: Secrets of Elvendale,> COVID-19 scare
LEGO Elves: Secrets of Elvendale,Did the director misgender them?
LEGO Elves: Secrets of Elvendale,"Hey man, you try making a fantasy world as big as ASOIAF and come up with unique names for every single character."
LEGO Elves: Secrets of Elvendale,"> That goes to naming the Tully characters Elmo, Kermit, Oscar and Grover, and then made them actually important in this upcoming war.

To be fair, [there is a version of the story where this is much more significant](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhWUFXvaZjo)."
LEGO Elves: Secrets of Elvendale,Wait till you hear about what names he picked for the characters in Elden Ring
LEGO Elves: Secrets of Elvendale,"Over at /r/boxing, there's constant confusion between two world champion level boxers - Jermall and Jermell Charlo - [The Charlo brothers are identical twins too](https://media.gq.com/photos/5b61cd9ec3eb8e424afb7343/16:9/pass/jermall%20and%20jermell-gqstyle-fall-2018-00.jpg). 

&#x200B;

So yeah, every once in a while this does happen IRL haha. Now funnily enough, despite them being twins, one fights at Middleweight, and the other fights at light middleweight, so odds are the two won't ever face each other in a fight. But I really, really want to see that fight happen just to see the confusion."
LEGO Elves: Secrets of Elvendale,"> That goes to naming the Tully characters  Elmo, Kermit, Oscar and Grover, and then made them actually important in this upcoming war.

i knew about the characters but didn't know they'd be important. that's fucking hilarious, can't wait to hear their names during some serious scene in the future.

so how long until the next season(s), people in other threads talking about a 2 year wait for the next one which is not good at all, like for the show."
LEGO Elves: Secrets of Elvendale,They aren't even the only identical twins named [Erryk](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Erryk_(guard\)) & [Arryk](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Arryk_(guard\)) in the series lmao
LEGO Elves: Secrets of Elvendale,"I'm starting to think GRRM just is in it to troll lol. Blue-balling millions of people by not finishing your massively popular fantasy series, only to throw them a bone by having the story completed by a show that had an all-time horrendous quality drop by the end of the series. To quote the great Fred Durst: ""Keep (t)rollin', (t)rollin', (t)rollin', (t)rollin' """
LEGO Elves: Secrets of Elvendale,"I once read something by Orson Scott Card about the importance of character names being distinct and connecting them to the individual to avoid confusion (think it was the forword of Speaker For the Dead iirc. Pretty interesting read actually.)

GRRM obviously does not subscribe to that notion lol"
LEGO Elves: Secrets of Elvendale,"Mmm, Kermit there Kingslayer* here. It's A Dance Dragons, yaaaaaaaah!

*Obviously not representative of the actual character"
LEGO Elves: Secrets of Elvendale,"Less a troll move and more to illustrate how arbitrary the division between blacks and greens was. Everybody was ultimately fighting to put a spoiled, wildly inbred, and >!incapable!< royal on the throne."
LEGO Elves: Secrets of Elvendale,"I think they should have changed it for the show, though. 

I mean, it's one thing to name them Arryk and Erryk in print where you can at least read the changes. But someone should have said to GRRM that having two guys who look exactly alike with names that sound exactly alike might not work on TV. 

I mean Yara Greyjoy in GoT was named Asha in the books but they changed it to avoid confusion with Osha, the wildling..."
LEGO Elves: Secrets of Elvendale,"The biggest troll from Martin is that he did it TWICE ! Well, to be fair Olenna Tyrell's bodyguards are named Arryk and Erryk in honour of the Cargyll twins"
LEGO Elves: Secrets of Elvendale,[removed]
LEGO Elves: Secrets of Elvendale,"There are several incidents of twins or characters who share a similar appearance possibly switching places. Two off the top of my head were a pair of Targaryen twins who switched places when the more adventurous one was forced to be a septa and switched places with her timid twin. The other is Myrcella and her handmaiden in the book, likely switching places to protect Myrcella's life while in Dorne."
LEGO Elves: Secrets of Elvendale,"There's also Arryk and Erryk in A Song Of Ice and Fire, better known as Right and Left."
LEGO Elves: Secrets of Elvendale,"I think Hodor wins that. It was so completely out of left field yet under our nose at the same time. And for a series that had fan theories as crazy as time traveling fetuses, I give him props for sneaking it in.

A fun little nugget is someone did sarcastically predict hold the door but they thought they were just being funny."
LEGO Elves: Secrets of Elvendale,[deleted]
LEGO Elves: Secrets of Elvendale,What oath did Erryk break?
LEGO Elves: Secrets of Elvendale,"The crowning scene was beautiful, but the introduction of the twins was a little abrupt.  We barely got to know them before the show started selling this conflict/rift between them that was supposed to mean something to us.  It lacked a lot of weight for me, especially in comparison to how heavy every other scene was hitting.

IMO one of the few poorly handled parts of season 1."
LEGO Elves: Secrets of Elvendale,I cant agree more on your comment. The crown scene was so amazing. The music / the speech / daemon facial expression. It beated all my expectation on that episode.
LEGO Elves: Secrets of Elvendale,They at first doubted him coming to Rhaenyra at first until he produced the crown showing where his true allegiances lay
LEGO Elves: Secrets of Elvendale,Bit of a shame they took the thing cole was known for away from him in the show
LEGO Elves: Secrets of Elvendale,"What's really cool about the books is how GRRM tells it as a historical accounting giving multiple sources and multiple versions of certain key events. 

Basically the book is narrated by a historian reading various sources and speculating himself which seems most likely.

It allows the writers and producers to make a choice of what actually happened without generally upsetting those who have read the book. Especially as at times the written sources the narrator of the book is reading vary massively about what happened. It gives the wiggle room to portray certain characters as monsters or heroes without betraying the source material.

I wonder if GRRM wrote fire and blood knowing it had a high chance of becoming a TV show and wrote it in a way that is perfect for adapting into one."
LEGO Elves: Secrets of Elvendale,I was a little scared they were going to cut the twins at the start of the series as their actions are some of the best parts of the Dance imo. I'm so stoked for next season.
LEGO Elves: Secrets of Elvendale,">he knew Rhaenyra to be the only person worth serving.

Rhaenyra hasn't done absolutely anything so far to be 'worth' serving, he just recognized her as the rightful heir"
LEGO Elves: Secrets of Elvendale,"Why is it heartwrenching?

Is it because you read the books and are posting spoilers?

Edit: lots of downvotes for being anti-spoiler.  Guess I'll leave the sub."
LEGO Elves: Secrets of Elvendale,Spoiler alert!
LEGO Elves: Secrets of Elvendale,So is this just Hound/Mountain Part 2? That's kind of lame
LEGO Elves: Secrets of Elvendale,I absolutely loved that see.
LEGO Elves: Secrets of Elvendale,When he brings out the crown and starts his oath I started to get quite Emotional. It was a beautiful scene. This show has already had a lot of great moments in it. Can’t wait to see the next part of the story.
LEGO Elves: Secrets of Elvendale,You should write recaps.
LEGO Elves: Secrets of Elvendale,"Erryk and Arryk Cargyll are played by actual twins. 

Jason and Tyland Lannister are played by the same actor."
LEGO Elves: Secrets of Elvendale,I imagine the fight scene is also a consideration.
LEGO Elves: Secrets of Elvendale,Oh shit they're Carl Gallagher?
LEGO Elves: Secrets of Elvendale,Underrated
LEGO Elves: Secrets of Elvendale,Who? The guy in the picture?
LEGO Elves: Secrets of Elvendale,"I may have just missed it. Would you explain maybe? One guy died? Or just bolted? And the other one switched sides, obviously. Are they both still alive. It was confusing."
LEGO Elves: Secrets of Elvendale,I’m so missing the adventure stories typical of fantasy that these twins became my favourite characters due to the closest thing to an adventure in the show when they went off searching the city for the missing prince.
LEGO Elves: Secrets of Elvendale,"i mean they look a little skinnier than id expect but i guess it is set in medieval times, maybe theyll be a little bigger when they have the special moment since they have an year to bulk up"
LEGO Elves: Secrets of Elvendale,There's only one and she runs back and forth really fast.
LEGO Elves: Secrets of Elvendale,Worked with child actors.
LEGO Elves: Secrets of Elvendale,It's a popular and recent TV show in a subreddit about television........
LEGO Elves: Secrets of Elvendale,Because it’s a pretty big show that was recently on TV. Soon there will be no headlines about it until it’s about to be on TV again.
LEGO Elves: Secrets of Elvendale,there's always been a huge market for young adult fantasy. remember when they used to load the new harry potter books into shops by the truckful?
LEGO Elves: Secrets of Elvendale,I also find it weird that the most upvoted things in a sub about Television seem to be about the most popular/discussed television shows.
LEGO Elves: Secrets of Elvendale,Yup. And also show Sunfyre and Dreamfyre instead of that dumb Rhaenys scene. My only problem with this season.
LEGO Elves: Secrets of Elvendale,"Funny how the *only* industry where workers are not interchangeable (well, except twins in this very specific case) and time is a lot of
money still treats covid *very* seriously… nothing to do with upper class."
LEGO Elves: Secrets of Elvendale,It only got good when it reminded you of an action scene from one of GoT worst seasons? I’m not sure you liked GoT for the reasons other people did.
LEGO Elves: Secrets of Elvendale,It’s still a thing everywhere
A Boy Name Flora A,Up until they said Korea I had no idea which systemic religious sex crimes they were going to expose. Keep 'em comin'!
A Boy Name Flora A,"10 years for three rapes, release, and subsequent rape..."
A Boy Name Flora A,Thought this was going to be about the moonies.
A Boy Name Flora A,"I’m not sensitive at all, I eat up horror and documentaries about uncomfortable topics, but this one is very brutally straight forward.

Like, there’s no sleepy drone footage of the protagonists hometown accompanied by slightly tense piano music to slowly set the mood, the first episode is an interview of one of his victims crying and describing being raped.

I think it speaks to how important the producer felt telling the story was and how much built up energy and oppression JMS created over the past few decades."
A Boy Name Flora A,"Aside from the documentary, I’d love to see what Netflix attorneys filed to nullify the injunction. 

Could you imagine the things that were submitted during the discovery period?  That’s a documentary all to itself."
A Boy Name Flora A,There are korean christian cults all over southern california. There are kids who are indoctrinated in these systems even to this day. I wish these churches get exposed for what they do.
A Boy Name Flora A,I grew up in a korean cult. Not a sex cult for the followers but I suspect the higher ups did whatever the fuck they wanted including marrying a 16 year old when the leader was 40.
A Boy Name Flora A,Blows my mind what some people can get others to do for them using religion.
A Boy Name Flora A,"A kpop idol had to release a statement through his company about his family’s involvement so this is bringing a big wave in Korea. And that same cafe that was ran, JMS, is apparently off the map in Naver, Korea’s search engine. Creepy stuff."
A Boy Name Flora A,"OMG!!! I’m actually shaking right now. I went to this church back in 2013 when my brother and sister in law dragged me to go. It was a branch in Tustin, California. They were suuupes wild."
A Boy Name Flora A,"We watched the first two episodes last night.  Way jacked up.  

It’s the same playbook used by pedos throughout the ages.  

One more “man of God” using the scriptures to literally screw children."
A Boy Name Flora A,"I tried to watch it but for some reason they decided to use ""interpreters"" rather than just having it subtitled and it sounds like a bad dub."
A Boy Name Flora A,Man the idea to get an injunction really backfired because now I want to know what they’re trying to hide.
A Boy Name Flora A,Cultist leaders abusing power.  Religion in a nutshell.
A Boy Name Flora A,Is there a particular reason why South Korea has so many weird religious cults?
A Boy Name Flora A,"""I've been involved in a number of cults both as a leader and a follower. You have more fun as a follower but you make more money as a leader."" - Creed Bratton."
A Boy Name Flora A,Korea needs to reject Christianity. They were brutally colonized by missionaries.
A Boy Name Flora A,Started this without even really paying attention to what I was selecting have some noise as I fell asleep. My eyes are closed and then wide open as some of the first shit you hear had me ready to vomit and murder someone at the same time.
A Boy Name Flora A,"Holy betrayal, Batman!"
A Boy Name Flora A,Reverend Moon?
A Boy Name Flora A,"and that is why i dislike religion so much. because the people that are in religions are mostly weak minded people and they are easy prey for the ones in power.

also for any rape victim. i ask you this. would you feel more safe when the rapist is dead, or still alive and knowing he will eventually come out of jail?"
A Boy Name Flora A,"I tried to watch this documentary, but to me they also used the victims to sell their documentary.  The doc used full footage of the victims naked and did not blur out an parts. It just felt like re-taking advantage of women that were brain washed and cult abused. I had to end it."
A Boy Name Flora A,Is this a good documentary? I added it to my list because I've never watched a documentary in another language and I watched so many KDramas.
A Boy Name Flora A,Cool now do the Catholics of America
A Boy Name Flora A,The only thing crazier than Korean Catholicism is American evangelism.
A Boy Name Flora A,Do jehovah's witnesses next
A Boy Name Flora A,Religious people be like: “come to our church so we can molest u”
A Boy Name Flora A,IMHO I can’t wait for all organized religion to die…. The harm it’s caused far outweighs any good.
A Boy Name Flora A,Why are Koreans so prone to cults?? I can kindda see why the Chinese government ban religious cults the likes of falungong from arising.
A Boy Name Flora A,Don't have religion where you idolize the leaders. Having religion could even apply to those who claim to believe in science. The scientific methodology is one where you test to determine if a hypothesis is false or not false. Because it isn't false doesn't make it true. Science is akin to forever chipping away at a slab of marble to determine the sculpture underneath. True science can only determine correlation and not causality. Statements of absolute causality are not statements of science but of religion.
A Boy Name Flora A,Will this involves the moonies?
A Boy Name Flora A,Every single religion has coverups rarely do they self report!
A Boy Name Flora A,All religions are a sex and money scam. Every single one.
A Boy Name Flora A,Anywhere else to watch it? Canceled Netflix due to the new password restrictions
A Boy Name Flora A,"Cool.

Now do Evangelicals in the US.

EDIT: To be clear, I think this is a great documentary and I'm glad they won the right to air it.  I'm saying I'd like to see this trend of exposing gross religious organizations by documentaries funded and platformed by major media companies continue on."
A Boy Name Flora A,Unrelated to the film itself but I wish it had either been titled *In the Name of God* or *A Holy Betrayal*.
A Boy Name Flora A,Man Koreans are not gonna like this one lmao
A Boy Name Flora A,how about a documentary on american religious leaders?
A Boy Name Flora A,If any of those guys are gay they are probably only into white guys
A Boy Name Flora A,"How about sticking it to Scientology? Or the fundamentalist Mormons, et al. I don’t care about some “leaders” in Korea. Go after the predators at home and I might be impressed."
A Boy Name Flora A,Netflix sucks haha
A Boy Name Flora A,[removed]
A Boy Name Flora A,"Good news, for sure, though I started watching this earlier this week and the production struck me as super odd. Might be a cultural thing, but the set design and editing is incongruous given the subject matter. 

Disclaimer: I only watched the first 15 mins of the opening episode."
A Boy Name Flora A,"Religion doing what religion does.  But people want to be lied to, so on it goes."
A Boy Name Flora A,The world is really fucked up.
A Boy Name Flora A,">3rd March

btw"
A Boy Name Flora A,"Yep. Was part of this cult before here in one their American branch and knew they we’re sketch since the beginning. Definitely members would manipulate to “evangelize” people. It’s flat out sad how many people are brainwashed and devoted to this cult and the leader. Insiders think that the media is just persecuting him and acting as a “devil” to bring down the “will of God”. His 10 years of imprisonment acts as Jesus dying on the cross to save us from our sins. His sermons are so boring and majority of the time, he just talks about himself."
A Boy Name Flora A,"LPT: don't join cults, especially ones where the leader claims to be be God or claims to be speaking for God. Actually, just don't join any fucking cults."
A Boy Name Flora A,"Oh some one sued to stop it. I wouldn't have watched it otherwise but now, straight on to the list."
A Boy Name Flora A,Seriously though. Are there any NON religious sex cults?
A Boy Name Flora A,I hope this series continues to expose more cults in Korea.
A Boy Name Flora A,"I just want to ask if anyone else felt like this was fake or dramatized when first watching it? 

Not trying to be offensive because I watch sooo much true crime, something about this felt a bit staged (the interview, having the victim play an iPad video, film stalkers outside a hotel). I just didn’t want to get duped with a horrific story but being told by actors. Again, I am not saying the story isn’t true - it’s disgusting and I fucking hate religion. I especially seek out religious docs as I was brainwashed southern baptist as a kid. I hate to hear these stories! 

Just a vibe and didn’t see anyone else mention it."
A Boy Name Flora A,"r/Shincheonji_Korea
It’s a place to discuss about cults in Korea including JMS"
A Boy Name Flora A,"I still don't understand why the mother in episode 6 ""Baby Garden of Death"" didn't say her son was murdered in court, and still stuck to his heart failing? What was the point when the case had gotten that far and lied just to hate herself and wish death upon herself everyday? Did I miss something?"
A Boy Name Flora A,"After having just read the Pope John Paul II and the sex abuse cover-ups, I was really hoping it would be the Catholic Church."
A Boy Name Flora A,I would subscribe to a series where they did an in depth dive into every sect. If they find no evidence of a particular group they name drop them. I guess that would be an evolving form of journalism.
A Boy Name Flora A,"I say, do the USA next!"
A Boy Name Flora A,I know its a messed up system there and you only get real time if you dont have money in korea
A Boy Name Flora A,"religion is the only part of society that coddles adults for submitting their critical faculties to a cult and wailing on about how more important their imaginary stories are than anything else going on in the objective reality we share. And you wonder how this hasn't been a magnet and cesspool for literal millenia, grifting entire societies for private ""sacred"" time with the children of the community, huddled around a bunch of decrepit old perverts.  Theism is child abuse, pure and simple. You want to con junkies and people who are at the bottom of their lives and have had all their defenses beaten out of them? That's one thing. Indoctrinating children before they've developed any cognitive defenses against shitty iron-aged emotional injunctions can fuck. right. off."
A Boy Name Flora A,Reminds me of “silenced” about the sexual abuse and Kentucky sentences at a Korean school for the deaf.
A Boy Name Flora A,Do they have any history of this sort of thing?
A Boy Name Flora A,"Even though some viewers criticized JMS episodes for being too explicit, but in fact, those episodes were somewhat censored by the production team themselves. According to the director of the series, what was captured in those first three episodes was only about a tenth of what the victims actually suffered.


He said one of the reasons they brought the project to Netflix was to expose reality of those crimes. But even for Netflix, he had to watered down description of sexual assaults of JMS cause it was too upsetting for the viewers. Some of crew memebers suffered traumas for days after covering the case he said."
A Boy Name Flora A,"The first thing you hear in the documentary is an audio recording of a rape in mid-intercourse, with some old man voice asking if the victim had an orgasm.  I did see the first minute or so of the interview, but I decided I didn't really want to see how far it was going to go after that."
A Boy Name Flora A,"I was kind shocked they showed video of nude girls with blurred faces and unblurred bodies right after the stories of how he was raping teenagers. Aside from not being sure how old any of those girls were, it seems extremely exploitative of Netflix to just expose that to the public. It's fresh victimization even if only a handful of people know who they are."
A Boy Name Flora A,"I have friends who turned to them and haven't heard from them in years. After joining they only ever wanted to hang out with me at their church events -> indoctrinate me.

Oddly enough they also said that Catholicism was satan or something. I also remember them believing that the end of the world is soon."
A Boy Name Flora A,"I dated a woman for a short time who was a member of one of these cults in CA, only I didn't know it until I looked up the name of her ""pastor.""

Her ideas about certain things were just bizarre and didn't make sense with my understanding of most sects of Christianity."
A Boy Name Flora A,i did too! weird way to grow up eh! there were some good times though. i think about the people a lot.
A Boy Name Flora A,Midnight Mass on Netflix was a documentary 😌
A Boy Name Flora A,"You will find predators in every system, willing and able to abuse their power dynamics."
A Boy Name Flora A,"Religion is just a medium.  You can look at all the things that happened in Hollywood, that have nothing to do with religion to see that all it takes is generic promises from someone who appears to hold power to get some people to do things.

This isn't excusing people using religion in such a manner, just showing that religion is method, not the base reason these things happen."
A Boy Name Flora A,"its literally built off that. The entire premise is that you must believe something without evidence, without understanding even. simple blind faith is required at the root of every religion.

anyone willing to believe in that is obv going to be more susceptible to other ideas with no proof, esp when they believe these orders are coming from God. Even easier if you can justify any of your ideas with weird interpretations of a text like the bible. And once you get some believers, their entire families usually get brought in"
A Boy Name Flora A,"For real. Over the last 10 years I've noticed more and more how awful religions can be. People use this *coughChristianscough* as an excuse to do awful and hateful things. I get it that not all religious folks are bad, but it's difficult to not be jaded."
A Boy Name Flora A,An extra pernicious part is how religion will make a point to call the parts of you they use to exploit as a “virtue”
A Boy Name Flora A,"Reminds me of Tool’s song, ‘Opiate’"
A Boy Name Flora A,If anyone prefaces their morality with religion.  There is zero morality.
A Boy Name Flora A,Name?
A Boy Name Flora A,Is this related to the unity Church?
A Boy Name Flora A,"You can change it to Korean audio with subtitles, but yeah it's annoying because then any English audio will be in Korean if there is any."
A Boy Name Flora A,just put the CC on then
A Boy Name Flora A,"You can change this in the audio settings, FYI."
A Boy Name Flora A,"I can’t do any dubbing. I have tried but when I see the words not line up with the mouth, my brain just cringes and I have to turn it off"
A Boy Name Flora A,That’s what I want to know! So many and so similar around the same time!
A Boy Name Flora A,Saying JMS and those cults are Christianity is like saying Trump is a far left liberal.
A Boy Name Flora A,Conformist societies fall easy prey to this kind of crap (see MLM schemes)
A Boy Name Flora A,"You'd assume, but no. Smaller, more modern ones. 

I wouldn't be too surprised if Netflix did try to do something on the Moonies and ended up being much more hamstrung than this."
A Boy Name Flora A,I feel so sick watching the former victim reliving the scene where she waved mops to jms. This documentary weirdly focuses on male gaze
A Boy Name Flora A,Its a good documentary  but its pretty hard to watch. The first 5 min of the 1st episode has a sound recording of a rape. It gets pretty gory too.
A Boy Name Flora A,"Pentacostals too. I've only heard testimonials from friends who have left churches of those denominations, but they definitely had wild experiences"
A Boy Name Flora A,Then do a series. All American religions.
A Boy Name Flora A,Organized religion is sinister sh!t.
A Boy Name Flora A,"Or that Koreans are much better about reporting cults, rather than trying to hide shit?"
A Boy Name Flora A,Do you think Chinese have freedom to make such documentary?
A Boy Name Flora A,🙃
A Boy Name Flora A,Well it’s made by Netflix so I’m gonna assume no
A Boy Name Flora A,You showed them.

A Boy Name Flora A,The only problem with that is that its too many documentaries too little time to make them. They already have a small mountain. The supply overtakes production regardless of demand.

Mobile Suit Gundam UC,"Still is! basically just ""if bruce wayne has a mech"" and also everyone in gotham has amnesia. i still rewatch it about once a year, so much style in that show"
Mobile Suit Gundam UC,Nothing makes you feel old like finding out Toonami turned 25.
Mobile Suit Gundam UC,Optimus Prime talking about machines/computers wiping out humanity as they grow self aware. 10/10
Mobile Suit Gundam UC,Was that a site like Limewire?
Mobile Suit Gundam UC,"**YES THIS IS IT!!!!**

Holy shit, thank you. I'm about to look for their old school bumps and just vibe out to nostalgia."
Mobile Suit Gundam UC,I remember a cartoon channel put together a bunch of clips of various cartoons set to Bare Naked Ladies “Falling For The First Time” and it always stuck with me.
Mobile Suit Gundam UC,If you're interested the band that does this is called Pain and they make great ska music
Mobile Suit Gundam UC,"[This is a great channel for that](https://www.youtube.com/c/SlimD716V2/videos), all of Toonami's finest remastered in stunning HD"
Mobile Suit Gundam UC,"Well aware, but thank you! I'm sure Pain is the root of my love for ska as an adult."
Mobile Suit Gundam UC,"This show is a masterclass of raising stakes in a story.  Do not sleep on it, even if it is dated."
Mobile Suit Gundam UC,"Man, first Babylon 5 is remastered on HBO Max,and now Mobile Suit Gundam is finally streaming.  Good week for sci-fi."
Mobile Suit Gundam UC,"When I was a kid watching it on toonami I thought it was a mecha show about a whining teen pilot.

After giving it a re-watch, be2i love the spin offs 08th MS team and sequel, Zeta Gundam. I learned it was truly what showed me war is fought by kids, 16-19 year olds who should be making love, or riding bikes in the park. It's deeper than you gave it credit for. The last battle, which takes place over 3 episodes has some of the most heart string drama and best space battles I've see.

Amuro isn't whining, he has PTSD and combat fatigue."
Mobile Suit Gundam UC,"Recommended watching for seasoned mech fans if they haven't already seen it. 

It's dated, but it's one of the most influential giant robot shows of all time gets something from this one. Kids going to war, getting psychologically messed up and coming out of it with lost friends and more mental issues then what they came with.

Also the robots r kewl."
Mobile Suit Gundam UC,My body is ready for the Bright Slap.
Mobile Suit Gundam UC,"If you’ve never seen MSG and start with this, don’t worry if it’s not your cup of tea. The fun thing about it is there’s a Gundam for everyone. So you could try one of the other series. Want one that’s coo coo bananas? G Gundam baby! Small scale drama with a Romeo and Juliet bent? 08th MS Team (my personal favorite). There’s even ones that are beyblade with Gundam in Build Drivers. Possibilities are endless"

Mobile Suit Gundam UC,"I just checked a week ago and was super disappointed. Checked it this morning and there it is! 

Man. Brings me back to the days of running to the living room, plugging in the code to turn the huge satellite dish, and then going downstairs to watch it with my glass of milk and Oreo pop tarts on my tiny tv."
Mobile Suit Gundam UC,"I was really impressed when I watched this. They did an amazing job of actually making the enemy into human beings instead of just fist shaking villains. Plus, they actually had a setting in which they convinced me that using giant robots to fight made sense."
Mobile Suit Gundam UC,"I just wish we could get Zeta on streaming now, but I assume due to rights issues, pertaining to the opening, that won't happen."
Mobile Suit Gundam UC,"This show is awful, guys. Nobody watch it. Whole series is based on a lie.

The One Year War doesn’t even last one year."
Mobile Suit Gundam UC,A story so good they told it again uh how many series are just a new take on MSG? 7 or so I think
Mobile Suit Gundam UC,Can someone verify that this is what **Gundam origins** is the prequel too.  I confused myself reading up on it.
Mobile Suit Gundam UC,I wish I could bundle this service with other things. The cost is a little high for the amount of anime I would watch but if it were a small add on to like Hulu this would be great.
Mobile Suit Gundam UC,will hello kitty appear in the new time line?
Mobile Suit Gundam UC,I tried to get into this but couldn't :(
Mobile Suit Gundam UC,"Great news! I do, however, prefer the the theatrical movies, which do a good job at condensing the series and trimming out the unnecessary fat, not to mention they redid some scenes that looked kind of bad on the show. I'm just sad that we've yet to receive a proper remake of the original. The Origin OVA doesn't cover the whole Origin manga (which is an excellent remake of the original series, authored/illustrated by the original character designer). I'm also sad that we never got a 90s remake in the style of [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCRtFptEMF8). Damn it would've looked good!"
Mobile Suit Gundam UC,No MSG added.
Mobile Suit Gundam UC,They're lucky they weren't sued for stealing the lightsaber.
Mobile Suit Gundam UC,"If your really into this kind of old anime I would suggest watching Legion of the galactic hero's, it's sort of like the [anime version of babylon 5] (https://i.imgur.com/jiVJML3.jpg). They [remade] (https://i.imgur.com/WaDOMAy.jpg) the first two seasons in 2018."
Mobile Suit Gundam UC,"Great!.

Now someone please sort out the details for Space Battleship Yamato (1974).

Can't even find a boxed set for the series that isn't insane due to being out of print."
Mobile Suit Gundam UC,So will this be on HBO Max???
Mobile Suit Gundam UC,Huge Gundam fan! Such a classic!
Mobile Suit Gundam UC,"It also has an amazingly funky soundtrack!

Mobile Suit Gundam UC,MSG is also on Funimation's streaming service BTW if you prefer mostly dub offerings. Just an FYI.
Mobile Suit Gundam UC,"Yeah there's an episode where Amuro goes fully catatonic and Bright just has him strapped into the gundam and sent off, figuring that once he was in battle he'd snap out of it when his survival instinct kicked in."
Mobile Suit Gundam UC,"Huh, sounds like Evangelion."

> It's dated, but it's one of the most influential giant robot shows of all time. gets something from this one. Kids going to war, getting psychologically messed up and coming out of it with lost friends and more mental issues then what they came with.

I'd highly recommend checking out Zambot 3, it's Tomino's(Director / Creator of Gundam) previous work that pushed the boundaries on robot anime. Suffice to say a lot of shit gets fucked up and it's not all goofiness."
Mobile Suit Gundam UC,08th MS Team is also my favorite. It really hit me different from anything else I had ever seen from Anime up to that point. It was also one of my favorite Gundam toys since it had the working backpack haha.
Mobile Suit Gundam UC,"I fuckin love G Gundam. It's definitely part nostalgia from it airing on Cartoon Network after school when I was a kid. But that series is what got me into Gundam. Everyone hates on it, but its hands down my favorite from what I've seen."
Mobile Suit Gundam UC,I liked G Gundam. I liked Gundam Wing more.
Mobile Suit Gundam UC,"Yeah if I'm recommending something to non-anime fans, MSG is not where I'd usually start. It can be...tedious. It is more for the anime fan who wants to see the classic roots of a franchise that now spans several universes."
Mobile Suit Gundam UC,"9/11 happened and killed off the anime that was ""too serious."" Then Toonami got moved to Saturday and Miguzi, which was lighter fare with shows like Teen Titans and Code Lyoko, took over on weekdays."
Mobile Suit Gundam UC,"Oh man, is it your first time watching? You're in for a ride! Definitely check out Zeta Gundam when you finish and the rest of the UC and other Gundam and mecha stuff in general. There's some incredible stuff out there that deals with some really heavy themes.

If you have any questions or need reccomendations, the folks over at r/Gundam are super friendly! Welcome, fellow Newtype!"
Mobile Suit Gundam UC,"They simply replaced the opening song on the blu-ray, surely they could do that for streaming."
Mobile Suit Gundam UC,"I haven't seen Gundam and don't know the story of it beyond that people pilot robots but if a war happened *within* one year then I think ""One Year War"" is an appropriate name for it."
Mobile Suit Gundam UC,Seed was like a shot for shot remake at some points.
Mobile Suit Gundam UC,The Gundam Origins OVA is a prequel to Mobile Suit Gundam... sorta. It’s technically pulled from the Mobile Suit Gundam: The Origin manga which was a retelling of Mobile Suit Gundam and is made by one of the original illustrators of the show. It changes a few things from the original series but but you can still watch the Gundam Origins OVAs as prequel content to the original series.
Mobile Suit Gundam UC,"This is correct. Gundam has 2 universes to it

1. ""The Universal Century"" which is what the ""main"" story of Gundam is. Its a massive war between the Zeon and the Earth Federation

2. Pretty much everything NOT the Universal Century. These are just one off worlds/dimensions that exist to tell a single story in a season, they have no relation to the Universal Century. These stories are actually more popular in terms of viewership- ""G Gundam"" (my favorite) Iron Blooded Orphans Gundam Seed and Gundam Wing

The UC is about 2 guys, Amuro Ray who is the protagonist and Char Aznable who is the anti-villain of the show. Gundam Origins gives us the backstory of Char Aznable. Gundam Origins is hella tight though, its effectively a Monte Cristo story"
Mobile Suit Gundam UC,Origins won't make sense until you watch the original series.
Mobile Suit Gundam UC,"I'll confirm it.  Sure. 

I've seen most of the gundam universe, and honestly don't have any idea what goes where, but I'll confirm it

Shining Finger! buh buh da buh da ba da!"
Mobile Suit Gundam UC,"The free version of crunchyroll has pretty much everything (barring certain original stuff), you just have to wait a week for new things and a lot of stuff isn't in HD."

I watch crunchyroll free of charge without ads. Just use an adblocking browser extension."
Mobile Suit Gundam UC,Isn’t it cheaper than every other streaming service?
Mobile Suit Gundam UC,"> The cost is a little high for the amount of anime I would watch

They also have some non-anime stuff like 
 cherry magic that was one of top shows in japan last year https://www.crunchyroll.com/cherry-magic-thirty-years-of-virginity-can-make-you-a-wizard"
Mobile Suit Gundam UC,MSG had already showed up on Funi's streaming service and a lot of their offerings end up on Hulu so who knows.
Mobile Suit Gundam UC,They did just release a hello kitty gundam.
Mobile Suit Gundam UC,"The animation is dated and there was a lot of goofiness, because it had a lot of super robot tropes.

I'd try the movie trilogy, but it's not properly dubbed or legally available."
Mobile Suit Gundam UC,"Try “War in the Pocket” gundam. Only 6 episodes. 

Most “universal century” gundam series are confusing, with weird names for characters, and a lot of it can be hard to keep track of. 

But not War in the Pocket.
It’s a lovely story. And if it’s still not your cup of tea after episode 1, no worries! Don’t force yourself just because others enjoy it. You probably already have things you enjoy anyway.

(Hopefully that one is on steaming. But you might also just be able to rent it)"
Mobile Suit Gundam UC,"That's because despite the love, the old show is actually boring as hell, like an old episode of speed racer.  Try gundam unicorn."
Mobile Suit Gundam UC,"Honestly, the simple omission of the G-fighter, G-bull, etc is enough on its own to make the movies vastly superior to the show."
Mobile Suit Gundam UC,"Lucas stole the idea for light sabers from pulp science fiction stories from the the nineteen teens and movie serials from the thirties and forties. Hell the word ""Jedi"" is a bastardization of the term used in Japan for samurai films."
Mobile Suit Gundam UC,The soundtrack is also streaming on Spotify!
Mobile Suit Gundam UC,"The soundtrack is so kitschy and I absolutely love it. My favourite track has got to be [From Sleep](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFoKkeTmYp4&list=PLE234F313FF53A39C&index=3), especially from 1:16 onward.

EDIT: And how can I forget the incredibly funky [Combat Airspace](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eszG8ww2GlQ&list=PLx9EEzTlMf5kEWPUK_a-q8OuVmHvf7ts5&index=5)!"
Mobile Suit Gundam UC,[I also love that it](https://youtu.be/_lOeFQvA-uM) [got a cover album by Andrew W. K. of all people.](https://youtu.be/zILVdHewOZ8)
Mobile Suit Gundam UC,"To be fair, OG Gundam created most of the tropes that have become the standard for long form war anime series. The price of being a genre defining game changer."
Mobile Suit Gundam UC,"Still, I advise everyone to watch the updated theatrical(1-3) or read the modernized series(the origin) instead. 

They are far more organized and accessible."
Mobile Suit Gundam UC,Already is and on HBO Max
Mobile Suit Gundam UC,"I checked it out, it's not anything new just a little less blurry."
Mobile Suit Gundam UC,"You know what got me? I rewatched it and Bright is the only survivor of the original crew, he was a military cadet in training. He was 19 years old. Not even an Ensign rank. And he was supposed to not only captain the most advanced ship in the fleet, but wrangle a bunch of literal kids. He is basically doing a Battlestar Galactica. I feel for him this time around. I watch the show in abject horror at like 25 as all the people dying except like Ramba Ral were 6 or 9 years younger than me.
Lalah Sunn was a genius bit of writing too if you watch further in the shows."
Mobile Suit Gundam UC,"Turns out when you do stories with a lot of depressing themes and death, you probably have depression."
Mobile Suit Gundam UC,"""Shut up and get in the Gundam, Amuro.""

Bright Noa is basically Gendo Ikari."
Mobile Suit Gundam UC,It’s like Evangelion if Evangelion was even slightly comprehensible.
Mobile Suit Gundam UC,"Victory and Zeta had very dark moments, ZZ for the first half was slapstick and hammy but fans are rewarded once the theme song changes"
Mobile Suit Gundam UC,">Zambot 3

Thanks I'll definitely give it a watch. The reason I specified ""one of the most influential"" instead of the first or the beginning was exactly for shows like zambot and giant robot animes that came before it. 

I think Mobile suit specifically was like a big breaking point or milestone in the entire history of mecha anime. I remember hearing stories that when it's film premiered in cinemas they literally couldn't fit all the people who came to see it in the theatre because tomino apparently had a big announcement. They didn't expect it's popularity to be so wild. There are people who apparently recorded entire episodes of the show onto casette tapes just to listen on their walkmen and casette players. 

The vinyl was released and THAT became a best seller. 

tl;dr it was a huge fucking show."
Mobile Suit Gundam UC,"They did that in the Bandai Visual release, so I'm not sure exactly what the deal is."
Mobile Suit Gundam UC,"I’m just referencing a meme from r/Gundam.

Someone did the math and it’s two or three days short of one year."
Mobile Suit Gundam UC,Seed was more a remake of Wing IMO and Wing was a super-condensed remake of MSG+Zeta+CCA.
Mobile Suit Gundam UC,Yeah Seed was probably the worst regarding this. Still enjoyed it though
Mobile Suit Gundam UC,"To elaborate, the original show was hampered by a combination of factors. The show was required by it's sponsors and producers to have a robot fight in every episode. The producers and sponsors meddled with the show constantly, forcing the creative staff to add designs to the show that only existed to make toys (most notably the G fighter or as Tomino called it, the coffin the series would be buried in) and forced them to make kid friendly episodes that broke with the rest of the narrative of the show. In addition, the show's run was cut from 52 episodes to 43. Also the main animator Yoshikazu Yasuhiko suffered from a severe medical crisis during the production of the show and was hospitalized about halfway through the run until the show's completion.

As a result of these limitations, major parts of the story such as the origins of Char Aznable and Sala Mass were cut for time as well as a planned flashback episode which would have explained much of the backstory to the runup to the one year war. The origin comic sought to remedy these issues as well as give the designs and tone a facelift to match the modern incarnations of the Universal Century. I'd highly recommend reading it. Yoshikazu Yasuhiko is an astonishingly talented artist and storyteller.  Not only are the drawings amazing, but the panel layouts, pacing, transitions and expressions are absolutely top notch. Unfortunately the vast majority of Yaz's comics have not been translated into English so the origin is one of only two comics he drew that you can get that isn't in Japanese."
Mobile Suit Gundam UC,Thanks!
Mobile Suit Gundam UC,"G Gundam is absolutely hilarious. A martial arts tournament in giant ass robots, with all the characters and their respective nations being *hella* stereotyped. Funny as fuck. I mean, just look at [Master Asia's introduction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03Fdj3pVW6w) here."

Tip the Mouse,Who broke the most on the set of Parks?
Tip the Mouse,"As a Doug, I have a question regarding the proliferation of the name in your shows. First Doug Judy came about, and that was wonderful. Then, The Good Place was full of us, (Doug Forcett, Eleanor's dad, Donkey Doug...) and it started to feel like there must be a reason why. I'd like to thank you for the representation and just ask if there was any writer or someone who really wanted to Doug things up.

Tip the Mouse,"Where did the idea from the speckles of light at the end of The Good Place came from? Sometimes, when I sit by the beach and meditate, I see them. It took my breath away to see them represented on screen, in such a powerful way. 

Thank you for all these shows, which have gotten me and my loved one through good and dark times."
Tip the Mouse,"One storyline I really enjoyed in the last season of Parks and Rec was April finally getting to pursue a career that she was actually passionate about. Given April's usual disdain for interacting with other people, I thought there was an interesting irony in the fact that her dream job ended up being a job that revolves around helping other people. I was curious what the thought process was for choosing this particular career path for April? Did you always plan this was the job she would choose or were there other careers that were in consideration during the writing process?"
Tip the Mouse,Hi Mike! What was the inspiration for April’s friend Orin?? Every one of his scenes was hilarious. My sister and I love Parks and Rec and he’s our favorite reoccurring character.

Tip the Mouse,"Hi Mike,

Big fan of yours although I have a bone to pick with you regarding the most trivial thing : the line of dialogue : *I can't believe* ''insert plot line that happened before the commercial''.

I know it's probably a writer's trick to remind the audience what has happened but I feel it's something that you must do because of the format of traditional network television. Hence my question :

Do you think that streaming will make for more robust writing ? Does the fact that shows are now *bingeable* is more unforgiving for TV writers?

Thanks! YOU DA MAN"

Leslie Knope is a beacon of hope that I never knew I wanted and the town of Pawnee was with me when I needed it most. I could go on for pages about how much I love every single character in what is unequivocally the greatest show on the planet, but here’s my question in case you wanna skip all this:

How do you approach sitcoms on an ideation level? At its roots your shows have very basic premises, but how do these evolve from an idea like ‘government employee in a small department’ or ‘dead woman in fake heaven’ to the fleshed out characters and plot lines that form the pilot episodes?"
Tip the Mouse,"Hi Mike! One of the things that stands out in Parks and Rec, The Good Place, and Brooklyn Nine Nine is their approach to blossoming romances in a way that doesn't overpower the show.

Tip the Mouse,"Hi Mike — thanks for all your work over the years! I’m a big fan of Shea Serrano’s work, too, and was thrilled to see the recent announcement about “Primos.” Can you share why you wanted to work with him and serve as an EP on his show?  The writing room looks fantastic."
Tip the Mouse,"Hi Mike! We met at the HoF earlier this month, and I wanted to thank you for taking the time to answer my questions. Since you're here, though, I will bother you with another. What is your all-time favorite Deadspin/Defector piece? Also, did you ever get out of Brett Ratner's old office? Or at least burn it down and start from scratch?  


P.S. Are you still George Bailey?"
Tip the Mouse,"What are your thoughts about Chris Pratt’s comments about not promoting the album? 

>	No one consulted me about it. They’re like, ‘Hey, do you wanna promote this album?’ I was like, ‘Whoa, there’s an album?’ And then they were like, ‘Yeah, you wanna promote it?’ And part of me is like, yeah, that’d be cool. I’ve always wanted to be, like, that actor who has the vanity album. You know, I hope it gets a million copies and I get this platinum album on my wall. But then on the other hand, I’m like, I don’t think I’m being compensated for this beyond the, whatever $15,000 an episode I was making for the show. I think I’m gonna say no. A hard pass on promoting your album.

Tip the Mouse,"Dear KenTremendous@Fremulon.biz, a long time ago through your twitter I was introduced to the wonderful world of Scorigami! A very easy question for you, we have had a Scorigami for the past 2 game weeks...Will we see one this week too, and if so will you be so bold as to predict the game?"
Tip the Mouse,"You've said your favourite tv series is the Shiled, but what is your favourite movie?"
Tip the Mouse,"The Celtics are under. 500, the Red Sox were eliminated, and the Pats lost to Brady in a gut-wrenching SNF game. This is more of a comment than a question."
Tip the Mouse,Will Congressman Ben Wyatt be voting in favor of Build Back Better?
Tip the Mouse,"There's a question I've been wondering about since The Awesome Album released. Listening to the [Ann Song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8lNHKvCyA4), it sounds a bit different than the version of the song on the show and Chris's voice sounds a bit different compared to the other songs on the album. I've heard older recordings of this song that sounded different than the version that's on the album. This has been making me curious every time I listen to the album. Do you know if this song was re-recorded for the album release and if so do you know the reason why?"
Tip the Mouse,"Hi Mike! Hope you’re doing well!

There’s a photo of Leslie and Ben slow dancing during Prom, do you remember if that was recorded as a whole scene or they just did it for promotional pictures?? If there is a scene, I NEED IT!"

Tip the Mouse,"I saw Adam Scott's audition with Rashida for Parks that was on the extras. He did so well, I wonder how come you guys didn't cast him the first time?"
Tip the Mouse,Who is your favourite Infinite Jest character?
Tip the Mouse,"On “Parks and Recollection” Rob Lowe and Alan Yang have talked multiple times at length about how much you love creating unique character names within your shows. What are some of your favorite main or even background character names that you’ve come up with?

Thank you!!

Also, who’s your favorite all-time Mariners player?"
Tip the Mouse,But what of Rat Mouse?
Tip the Mouse,"Is there any creative choice you've made in a show that you wish you could change now, either because it didn't ring true to the show's spirit or because it took the show down a weird storyline that you feel could have been better?"
Tip the Mouse,"Hi Mike,

What was the origin of Lil' Sebastian? 

The episode/moment when he's introduced and everyone loses it and then shits on Ben for not getting it is top five for me."

Tip the Mouse,Was Bo Burnham already working on his country song in his special Make Happy when he was cast as Chip McCapp? Or did his character on P&R inspire that song? Or are the two completely unrelated?

Tip the Mouse,What would Leslie’s President campaign slogan be?
Tip the Mouse,"I know there were a good amount of references to LOST in The Good Place, what was your favorite LOST reference you put in & who is your favorite LOST character?"
Tip the Mouse,"The cast and crew of every show you work for sing your praises on how you create a workplace that feels like a family, through building a psychologically safe place for all to experiment, fail, and improve.  Those higher than you in your power structure likely have a difficult time appreciating the importance of fostering this type of culture, especially if it appears to go against their bottom line.  How do you best advocate for your people's freedom to be creative and feel safe, when those above you may feel the time and resources dedicated to these values are wasteful?"
Tip the Mouse,Hey Mike! What was it like getting punched by HHH during the Rocks SNL monologue?
Tip the Mouse,What moment on the set of Parks & Rec made you laugh the hardest?
Tip the Mouse,"On RoLo and Alan Yang's podcast, they talked about an S1 episode script written by you that was thrown out.  Do you remember the plot and could share what it was about?"
Tip the Mouse,"The scene where Leslie actually tells Ben that she’s pregnant, was it written differently? Or the episode was written the way it was released?"
Tip the Mouse,Do you remember who came up with calzones for Ben Wyatt's favorite food?  And why?  It's so random!  (and brilliant)
Tip the Mouse,"How come not all deleted scenes of a show make it onto the DVDs and are just lost to the archives? 

Is there any chance a show like The Office or P&R could have all the deleted scenes edited back into the show and released on DVD? I'm aware of the Peacock extended cuts, but they barely add anything back in. I own the DVDs so I know there are a lot more not in there. There's no amount of money I wouldn't pay to see every shot scene edited back into the show!"
Tip the Mouse,Have you ever seen a ghost?
Tip the Mouse,Will you ever revive Fire Joe Morgan or create something similar?
Tip the Mouse,"Mike, thank you so much for the entertainment you have brought through the years!

Are there any character storylines or growth that you look back on and DON'T like/wish you could change?

Bonus question: I always felt like there could have been more to Paul Schneider's/Marks storyline. Was there anything planned for him that you didn't get to do? Was there any Easter eggs about what happened to the character?"
Tip the Mouse,Which character was your favorite to write for on Parks?
The Story of Diana,"""this will function well as a series finale, unless Apple wants to pay me so much money for season 4 that I can buy my own island."" 

Which I think is fine. Guarantee some level of closure for the series, give Sudeikis an option to move on or stay, and leave the door open if Apple wants to bring other characters/actors and writers back."
The Story of Diana,I'd be happy to see it end naturally than renewed with the writers kind of stuck.
The Story of Diana,I need a Higgins spin off where he solves crime in the countryside.
The Story of Diana,It either had to end or they needed to move it to the US.  It doesn't make any sense for his character to miss his kid's entire childhood.
The Story of Diana,"I hope Ted Lasso's character gets a solo spinoff, they could call it ""Ted Lasso"""
The Story of Diana,I feel like they wrote themselves in to a bit of a corner by giving him a kid. Ted is not the type of character to not be in his child’s life even if it’s an amazing job opportunity. They kind of have to end it unless the kid moves with him to the UK or something.
The Story of Diana,That's good. I like that they get to leave on their own terms instead of being pressured into more seasons by greedy network execs
The Story of Diana,Bill Lawrence confirmed it was a 3 season arc quite awhile ago. I believe before the second season even came out. He talked about it on the Scrubs podcast (way back when I still listened to it).
The Story of Diana,"Not every show needs to last forever 

I know they are anime but full metal and death note are two of the best anime’s because they tell a story and End

Not everything needs to be the office or simpsons where the show dies but keeps going because someone will just watch it"
The Story of Diana,At least we will have shrinking.
The Story of Diana,"Wouldn't it be a perfect fit for Ted to be interviewed on The Morning Show? Both on Apple and I've noticed that Apple uses a lot of the same actors in more than one show, although not playing their other character."
The Story of Diana,"2 tablespoons of red wine vinegar, 1 teaspoon of Dijon mustard, 1 teaspoon honey, a pinch of kosher salt and 1 finely chopped garlic clove. Whisk in 2-4 tablespoons of olive oil."
The Story of Diana,More shows should plan to be finite. Makes them stronger pieces of work compared to letting them slowly become bastardized versions of themselves over multiple seasons.
The Story of Diana,I am totally fine with that. We've gotten so many shows which started out really strong but it became obvious the showrunners never had a clear exit strategy. Come up with a story with a clear beginning and end and don't just extend the middle part because studios throw money at it.
The Story of Diana,"Ted is a character that is the glue to the show. All the stories and side characters work as a compliment and a foil to him. That's why season 1 was amazing.

Season 2 started to have characters doing their own thing, and honestly it was weaker for it. Rebecca went from this really compelling season 1 character to just being on her phone the entire second season and having that really awkward love arc with Sam. Keeley dealing with her boy troubles.... I mean it wasn't bad but it wasn't all that interesting either.

I can't really imagine having much interest in the characters if Ted isn't involved."
The Story of Diana,"Season 4 will be about how Ted goes home to
America and starts coaching in the MLS. It will pair well with Apple’s purchasing of the MLS rights."
The Story of Diana,Great story it is. But the best stories end leaving the audience wanting more.
The Story of Diana,"I’m sad, this show has become my comfort show lol. I wouldn’t mind a 4th season. But it’s nice to know they’re not going to drag it on."
The Story of Diana,"honestly, i would be very down for a Roy Kent spin-off with him being the Head Coach."
The Story of Diana,"I thought season 2 was a noticeable downgrade from the first. Maybe it's because season 1 came out during Covid and everyone needed a bit more happiness, but I thought the writing in S2 had such a drop in quality.

The Ted's mental health storyline felt really hamfisted, the Rebecca/Sam stuff had no real bearing on anything, the Rick Astley funeral singalong veered into cringe over earnest and I still think it's so weird that Brett Goldstein has written himself to be the character that everyone loves/is attracted to/wants to be mates with."
The Story of Diana,id be fine with season 3 being the last. its been great.
The Story of Diana,Beginning middle and an end? I’m into it
The Story of Diana,Man people really turned on Nathan at the end of season 2. I'm still just waiting for the big lesson he learns in season 3. As if they were just gonna leave it at he's an asshole lol.
The Story of Diana,"Am I the only one who doesn’t think this is the greatest show ever? Like I enjoy it, it’s fine. But I also find it to be overly saccharine and the character of Roy is just so forced. He’s too much. The grumbling and the fake toughness, etc. I only ever see rave reviews/comments/posts about it and, like, I can’t be the only one, right?"
The Story of Diana,"I would absolutely love a limited series (think one short season) catered around Coach Beard. Maybe a couple years post-Ted Lasso, he’s just… floating around Europe, being his best bohemian self."
The Story of Diana,"Ted Lasso is the most basic, cheesey, shit. Probably why it's so popular."
The Story of Diana,What if they did a semi-AHS and took the cast and did a whole new story and characters with them the next 3 seasons?
The Story of Diana,Noooooo!!! Finally a show that is positive. 😢😢
The Story of Diana,"Pay him more, Apple. You have enough money to buy all of Hollywood."
The Story of Diana,Whatever go concentrate on Shrinking it’s better anyway
The Story of Diana,"We don't need anything else regarding this show.  Just let it be three seasons.

No spin offs, nothing."
The Story of Diana,I want a Led Tasso spinoff
The Story of Diana,Ted lasso and Ted the bear move in together.  Hilarity ensues
The Story of Diana,Sad it’s leaving but fantastic to see they are ending it on their terms and how they wanted to tell it. Not many series can claim that.
The Story of Diana,I have enormous respect for creators who have a plan for their series and deliver a f@#£+ng ending.
The Story of Diana,"Hmm …

End of the story they wanted to tell. That’s a pretty open ended comment.

I mean - Ted Lasso could go back to the US, coach an American football team using what he’s learned from the UK. 

Or, he could go to Australia and coach an Australian Football team. 

New stories. Same character."
The Story of Diana,Someone at apple has been tasked w determining the cost of the average celebrity island and the revenue from Season 4.
The Story of Diana,There are islands in the US that cost only in the hundreds of thousands of American dollars...
The Story of Diana,"Ironically, his kids now live in Richmond. There are some islands in the river but I don’t think any are for sale."
The Story of Diana,"https://www.privateislandsonline.com/search?region=&diversion=&availability=sale&price_range=0%3A50000000&size_range=0%3A1000&q=&view%5B%5D=1&type%5Bprivate_island%5D=1&order=price_usd%3AASC&order=price_usd%3AASC&type%5Bprivate_island%5D=1

He should be asking for more money."
The Story of Diana,With his new crime solving cat as partner?
The Story of Diana,[deleted]
The Story of Diana,This is the spin off I didn’t know I needed
The Story of Diana,Aka Magnum PI
The Story of Diana,Higgins-Hot Fuzz crossover?
The Story of Diana,"They could kill off the kid, but in y'know, a wholesome Ted Lasso kind of way."
The Story of Diana,"Three seasons for this type of show seems about right. Season 1 ended with relegation, in Season 2 they returned to the Premier League, and in Season 3 they presumably win the Super Premier League Bowl or whatever the Brits call it. Then we all hug, cry, and go home. 

Not everything needs to be stretched out."
The Story of Diana,Kid/ex wife could move to England or some nearby country in a very convenient plot line.
The Story of Diana,"> they needed to move it to the US

Roy Kent as a college (American) football coach would be amusing."
The Story of Diana,Moving the team to the US might actually be really fun. The opposite culture clash from season 1.
The Story of Diana,or the mom dies and the kid grows up in britan
The Story of Diana,"> It doesn't make any sense for his character to miss his kid's entire childhood

Who cares about that? Just get him being hit by a ball, die and them make a fake wholesome moment about Lasso getting over it."
The Story of Diana,They could move the kid to the UK if the ex wife had an aneyurism or car accident.
The Story of Diana,Or a dark edgy reboot called Lasso.
The Story of Diana,After being a successful coach to a football club in England he travels to the US to try his hand at being an American football coach. It is a fish out of water story.
The Story of Diana,Maybe they give him a radio show. Then you could call it “Ted Talks”
The Story of Diana,The Ted Lasso
The Story of Diana,We’ll this was their plan from the beginning. It’s not writing yourself in a corner when you are setting out to tell a planned story.
The Story of Diana,"Ted’s kid learning about the UK from a Ted who’s lived there for two or three years would be kind of fun, and extend it a little bit. But a clear end is a great thing to be able to get."
The Story of Diana,"I think too many season's of a show ruin it rather than help it.  I understand we live in the world of ""more is better"" but not in my opinion.  Gives me 3 amazing seasons and tells a awesome arc.  Eventually, your show's characters run through their personal arcs.  All you're left with is recycling of plotlines using the same characters.    
Give me quality, not quantity."
The Story of Diana,FMA was brilliant. Death Note should have ended with that one character’s death.
The Story of Diana,"I was going to say it sounds like Bill Lawerence has shrinking and a few possible
Other irons in the fire. Rather get quality over quantity."
The Story of Diana,"Ha! I love this idea! 

What is this?! A crossover episode? 🐕"
The Story of Diana,"And they could then end it by saying coming next “the president of Lumon tells us about their new technology to change work as we know it forever” and then Ted can run into the dad from Trying on a pub and Jared Leto as the Wework founder happens to be there too because it’s all a shared universe! 

I’m happy Reddit theories are not used to write tv shows"
The Story of Diana,"Fuck it, do a Bad Sisters crossover."
The Story of Diana,Apple Cinematic Universe
The Story of Diana,Is this the recipe for Ted's shortbread cookies?
The Story of Diana,Tbh it is a very good dresssing
The Story of Diana,"Boooooo hissss, haha I am more interested in Higgins, family, and his jazz roots that what happens to Ted."
The Story of Diana,"Agreed. S2 lost all the fish-out-of-water underdog charm of the first. Yes there were plot conflicts to resolve but except for Ted's therapy storyline it was all hugs and smiles and opportunity. Complete inversion of the basis for the show and it was pretty boring story to have most of the high-stakes drama resolved, everyone wins, and their problems are just soap opera relationship stuff.

My one hope is Nate, I actually think his betrayal is the start of a potentially great plot that would mirror the first season."
The Story of Diana,Already have Jim Curtin in Philadelphia built in as Ted's rival if they want.
The Story of Diana,"Nah, move back and coach in the PAC-12, seeing as they’re about to sign that deal. I’d love to see Ted in his element as a (proper) football coach."
The Story of Diana,"100%. Now that Ted has ""won"" and charmed everyone from British heiresses to his team to even Roy, the stakes are so low and the plots are all so irrelevant.

The biggest mistake is that the therapy storyline isn't even about Ted's family at home at all (the one thing that Season 1 did to give his character some complexity and tension). It's just about his dad committing suicide. Deep stuff I guess, but no relation at all to the story"
The Story of Diana,"You just might be, haha. That being said, nothing wrong with you. It’s just not your cup of tea, or mug of coffee if American, or bag of weed if Californian."
The Story of Diana,"I think the characters are what make ethos show. Assuming their story ending involves one or more of them going separate ways, I would love a limited series based solely around one character each year. 
Year one Keeley, two Beard, three Higgins and so on. 6 episodes per season, not really a spin off in traditional form."
The Story of Diana,"I know you’re getting downvoted but you’re not terribly far off, Apple has over 50 billion in cash on hand, if they wanted to they could buy Warner Brothers (est. ~37 billion) and Universal Studios (est. ~12 billion). Then we can get the long awaited Ted Lasso/Batman/Veggitales crossover we’ve all wanted."
The Story of Diana,"It’s not really just the revenue, it’s the point of their whole platform. Haven’t seen a single other show on AppleTV besides For All Mankind that I found compelling to binge. I wasn’t a huge fan of Severance, their other hit."
The Story of Diana,By “island” I’m assuming he means “Australia” kinds of money.
The Story of Diana,I assume because the real cost would involve setting up infrastructure and whatnot.
The Story of Diana,"There’s an island near Syracuse, NY. Probably super cheap, considering all the chemicals in the water."
The Story of Diana,Claw-dia Schiffer
The Story of Diana,Honestly I see it now. He solves crime by day and every episode ends with him doing a smooth jazz number at his local haunt.
The Story of Diana,"They could just pretend the kid never existed at all. Even if one character mentions it, Ted Lasso plays dumb and it’s all played for laughs, maybe a few jokes about milk and cigarettes."
The Story of Diana,"This could still yield a crossover with Shrinking (same team of creators), with Harrison Ford as Ted's therapist, helping him overcome grief and return to London. That would give an expanded universe for Apple, which doesn't have IPs.  

I would still send Roy Kent to coach an MLS team, helping to popularize the league, now that they have a 10-year deal with Apple."
The Story of Diana,"I like your style! Let me try. They could have the United States and Russia fall in a nuclear war, but in y’know, a wholesome Ted Lasso kind of way."
The Story of Diana,Oh no! Is Danny Rojas gonna bean him with another ball to the head?
The Story of Diana,I  believe it’s the Super Series Bowl World Stanley Cup
The Story of Diana,"Going from promotion to winning the league would be....something.

Unless there's a time jump, that feels like it would be quite the stretch of imagination. Though maybe they can have they go for a smaller cup, and come up against Nate's West Ham in the finals."
The Story of Diana,"If they keep it realistic Richmond might win the EFL...I mean the Milk Cup, The Littlewoods Challenge Cup, The Rumbelows Cup, The Coca-Cola Cup, The Worthington Cup, The Carling Cup, The Capital One Cup, and now, The Carabao Cup. 

Could beat West Ham for it."
The Story of Diana,"Ted season 3 - ok guys, have you heard about PED's?"
The Story of Diana,Did I miss where they were promoted to the premiere league at the end of season two? Honest question
The Story of Diana,There’s always Champions…or World Cup…I really do love this show
The Story of Diana,It turns out Michelle was a college baseball coach the entire time and comes over to England to coach a first class cricket team.
The Story of Diana,Because she was hired to direct a Marvel tv series?
The Story of Diana,It'd basically be Vinnie Jones' coach character from She's the Man. I'd watch that all day.
The Story of Diana,The Lasso of Us.
The Story of Diana,Led Tasso
The Story of Diana,"I could see YouTubers making 40 minute video essays about how brilliant of a name is ""Lasso"""

Disjointed,Its like a show about stoners written by someone who has never smoked weed. 
Disjointed,"Headline next summer: Netflix's Fidget Spinner Factory Workplace Comedy ""Spinning Out of Control"" with Andy Dick is the Worst Reviewed Show of the Summer"""
Disjointed,It's almost like Chuck Lorre is a shitty television producer
Disjointed,"I was excited at first, thinking it might be along the lines of Weeds. Then, I saw that it is from Chuck Lorre (creator of Two and a Half Men and Big Bang Theory). 
  
Hard pass."
Disjointed,Disney Channel meets Weeds
Disjointed,I'm a total pot head and I found myself thinking it was possibly the worst show ever written. I didn't even make it through the 1st episode. 
Disjointed,"a show about marijuana dispensaries.  *Great!*

From the creators of Big Bang Theory and 2 and Half Men. *Fuck!*"
Disjointed,"I was excited when I saw it, I love Kathy Bates, but the style they chose...

It's filmed like it's ""The Last Man Standing"", with Tim Allen, laugh track and all. The opening scene was them filming a commercial so I thought the style was a gag for that at first, but no. Just terrible."
Disjointed,"I gave up after the ""tokin(g) Asian"" joke."
Disjointed,"The laugh track is just the worst. Who thought that was a good idea.

If they filmed this like The Office or Park and Rec, it would have instantly made it better.

"
Disjointed,"Netflix needs to find a better way for producing original content. Are they not running focus groups and live audience skits to test ideas?

They are going to go broke producing entire seasons of shit as experiments."
Disjointed,"I saw the rankings on RottenTomatoes. It has a [13% rating on there](https://editorial.rottentomatoes.com/guide/summer-tv-scorecard-2017/). I gotta be honest, as bad as Disjointed is, it's not worse than Gypsy."
Disjointed,"For the record, it _is_ chocked FULL of bad stereotypical 'stoner' jokes and cringeworthy line deliveries."
Disjointed,I smoke and this show didn't even make me chuckle
Disjointed,"Missed opportunity not casting James Franco and Seth Rogen. Or just making Pineapple Express, the series."
Disjointed,Disappointing. It's not like Cathy Bates is strapped for roles. She is way better than this rubbish. 
Disjointed,"The second I heard the laugh track, I shut it off. "
Disjointed,Just watching the preview you can tell it is complete and utter shit.  I'm amazed it made it through to being produced at all. 
Disjointed,"Say what you want about Chuck Lorre productions and sitcoms with laughter and whooos but the way the show tackles the PTSD issues of veterans is worth mentioning. Although they sadly abuse it sometimes for cheap jokes, the visual representation of Carter's(the vet) traumata through poetry and psychedelic cartoon clips is intriguing and insightful. A rare artistic gem to be found in a sitcom."
Disjointed,I cannot handle the laugh track. Sooo bad
Disjointed,"Huh, I'm actually surprised.  I watched the entire series and I don't even like weed.  I wouldn't say it was good, but I've seen worse.  The laugh track though...I felt like I was watching Big Bang Theory for stoners.  Maybe the show was just so bad that I found it amusing and stopped noticing how terrible it was, because in retrospect it had some absolutely terrible and annoying characters.  And that martial arts instructor who was a terrible knockoff of White Goodman."
Disjointed,I just saw this available yesterday just seemed like a shitty DUDE WEED LMAO show. and this is coming from someone who loves to smoke
Disjointed,"Watched half of it.  What's with the laugh track?  I have no idea who approved this turd, but they should go into another business.
"
Disjointed,"I actually enjoyed it, oh well."
Disjointed,"The first episode I thought was terrible but kept watching because I liked the premise.  By the last episode I was really enjoying it.  Hooked me somewhere around the 4th or 5th episode.  Hoping Netflix renews it.

I recommend watching a few episodes before giving up on it.  Gets progressively funnier. "
Disjointed,[deleted]
Disjointed,"eh, its not too bad, got really baked and watched it, probably helped lol"
Disjointed,"Honestly I've enjoyed the hell out of the show, when I watch it I play a little game: I take a hit of weed every time someone on the show smokes."
Disjointed,"After binging the whole first season I actually enjoyed it. The concept was fresh, the humor was silly and the characters become very enjoyable towards the end of the season. The point of the laughtrack is to make fun of older sitcoms, it is overbearing at times but when not taken seriously can be really comical. Sure Disjointed isn't for everyone and it is hard to get past episode 1 but I give props to Netflix for originality and binge-ability and I hope they make a season 2"
Disjointed,Kill the laugh track and the show would improve instantly. From total shit to mediocre shit.
Disjointed,I know how bad this show is but I still watched the whole thing and enjoyed it.
Disjointed,But hey it led to Netflix releasing official weed strains for some of their shows!  So at least some good came of it. 
Disjointed,"i think it is better than what people are saying...that said...it has no idea what it is supposed to be.  it reminds me of an off-color full house...tries to be serious, but then also weird...and then super heavy and then there is some weird sex joke, then back to serious."
Disjointed,"I think if reviewers watched the whole (half) season that's out it would get moderately decent reviews.

The show has a lot of issues (pointless/purposefully annoying characters, stereotypes, some stale jokes, identity crisis), but it does hit a nice stride after a while. There are actually some really impressive and moving scenes, and the show's very existence as a super mainstream-style sitcom about drugs makes it pretty unique. Every episode features some pretty impressive animation. As a whole it's anything but artistic or highbrow but it is vaguely innovative and interesting and pretty funny.

Would give the show a B, but you have to have a taste for trashy TV in order to enjoy it. Personally I think everyone should watch a few garbage shows - it's a nice break from meticulously produced ""intelligent"" TV."
Disjointed,[deleted]
Disjointed,Saw Chuck Lorre did it and ran as far the fuck away as i could
Disjointed,"Am I the only one that actually enjoyed it? I hate sitcoms, but I thought this one was well thought out, all of the storylines could be matched with real life cases/worries about cannabis legalisation around the world. Such as Carter with PTSD, Tae Kwon Douglas being all ""don't smerk the derps"" and I thought it came across simply and funny. I don't think it's meant to be a serious comedy sitcoms but more of a satirical sitcom with the over the top backing laugh. I've watched it through a few times and constantly finding little bits, but I think because I'm in the UK I may have a different view to people who may live in a weed legal country"
Disjointed,"I watched the first few episodes high as a kite. I didn't get one laugh. I actually felt embarrassed watching it. Super disappointing show, I saw Kathy Bates was in it and tbh, I thought she was better then that. "
Disjointed,This is unfortunate for the majority of cannabis users since the majority are 'high' functioning and responsible people. Weed gets such an unfair perspective for people who aren't familiar at all with it. They take these highly exaggerated 'stoner' tropes and hold these perspectives to all users. 
Disjointed,Big surprise! It's produced by Chuck Lorre. All his shows are garbage. 
Disjointed,"Wow, i like to consider myself someone with pretty good taste in television and i like this show so far. Im really surprised people dislike it so much. "
Disjointed,"I think its biggest problem is no one is giving it a chance. I almost passed after hearing the laugh track but after sticking through it I saw that the show was actually more clever than it initially let on. The whole thing is very meta. It's ""commercials,"" the over the top exaggerated tropes, the way it makes fun of those same tropes, the overall presentation of it,...It's basically a parody of itself. I found it to be one of the best original takes on a sitcom I've ever seen. It occasionally throws out some dark themes and seems more grounded in reality for brief periods only to be ripped away to fantasy sitcom world by another laugh track. I thought that was actually pretty genius. 

While it's not for everyone, I hope it reaches the right audience because there is undoubtedly more to it than the standard sitcom. Some people will still be annoyed by the laugh track and others just won't appreciate what they're trying to do and that's cool too."
Disjointed,How can anyone watch a show with a laugh track in 2017 and not feel like a fucking idiot?
Disjointed,I watched every episode of this show and I liked some parts and others I was just too stoned to care. But the events with the veteran security guard and his trials with ptsd is one of my favorite parts. He is a great character. 
Disjointed,"its really not that bad, I mean its not good but I liked it way more the The Defenders. Plus the cool animated scenes for the security guards backstory and PTSD are really really cool. "
Disjointed,"On a scale of 1 to 10, I give this show a big fat NOPE."
Disjointed,as much as you are angry about you have to kind of understand. chuck lorre knows how to talk to the masses. i know tons of people who are in love with two and half men and bbt. hell i enjoyed bbt first two season got sick of it later on. the old folk with netflix will enjoy this like they do with csi and other chuck lorre cbs stuff. and netflixs need that crowd as much as the prestige television crowd they have. 
Disjointed,"""Chuck Lorre, everybody."" (canned applause track)"
Disjointed,"These Netflix sitcoms are kind of terrible but I eat them up. Watched all of Disjointed baked as fuck, knew it was terrible, and loved every minute of it. "
Disjointed,"Big Bang Theory sucks, and so does this show."
Disjointed,But can we talk about the ptsd story and how they chose to show it.
Disjointed,"I don't know, maybe unpopular opinion but I enjoyed it. I loved how they rendered the PTSD flashbacks.  

Edit: a word"
Disjointed,"So, i am not allowed to laugh at anything with a laugh track(even though its a live audience). Got it. Thanks reddit!  "
Disjointed,Netflix is starting to put out too much crap for my taste. 
Disjointed,"According to links I've seen, Roseanne Barr years ago speculated on doing a reboot of ""Roseanne"" where one possibility was she and Jackie would be running a pot dispensary.

Chuck Lorre used to work on ""Roseanne"" - which leads me to think he stole this  premise about the pot dispensary from her. If so - it serves him right if the show sucks.
"
Disjointed,Idk why people are hating on it... The show is actually pretty great if you take a second to realize what they are trying to do with it before bashing the shit out of it because you don't get it.
Disjointed,"I've stumbled upon it and binged the first season right away.

Of course it's from chuck lorre so it will go only downhill.

But I've had some great laughs watching it, the style is very particular and I don't know any comparison show...

Maybe it helps to just be at least [7]"
Disjointed,"Any new show with a laugh track in 2017, needs to GTFO. The only show I watch with a laugh track is ""Two Broke Girls"" and that's just so I can stare at Kat Dennings. "
Disjointed,Still better than big bang
Disjointed,"Besides Stranger Things, I have yet to enjoy any other Netflix original.

I'm currently suffering through Ozark. It's just a really bad knock off of Breaking Bad. The writing and plot are just so bad."
Disjointed,"All this hate and I'm just sitting here waiting for Part 2.

Hate the laugh track however I just tune t out like I do on The Ranch"
Disjointed,This is a Chuck Lorre show. Need I say more?
Disjointed,"Is it just me or does it seem like as a whole Netflix shows have been drastically declining in quality? Sure there been bad shows but it was nestled in with greats, and now it seems like every new show they introduce is mediocre at best. It seems like it's focusing more on quantity over quality with in-house shows, and don't get me wrong that's not a generally bad thing because more shows means more for people who like different genres, but now it just seems too much now. Oh well, here's praying Witcher's good"
Disjointed,I tried watching it...awful
Disjointed,Omg it's horrible and I worked in a dispensary
Disjointed,">As stale as an unwashed bong.

What a review!"
Disjointed,"Maybe I don't understand California dialects and accents, but it seemed like Kathy Bates was all over the place with her accent."
Disjointed,Should've gotten character actress Margo Martindale to play the lead instead. 
Disjointed,"But, like, weed tho!? If it has weed in it smokers will watch. Fact.

It has weed."
Disjointed,"I watched all of it, it was mostly bad but it had its moments, I chuckled a couple times but something really missed the mark. The concept could work but it needs some serious polishing...

They really overdid the pothead stereotypes. Almost to the point of being insulting. It was a bit like it was produced by the same people who make the educational videos for D.A.R.E. 
A lot of the dialogue was shit. 
Kathy Bates' talent was underutilized...her role was poorly written.
There was no real character development in general. 
The plot had no discernible structure or direction, it just kind of meanders around until they throw a wrench at it by having them get raided by the DEA. 

They need to throw some Amy Poehler or Tina Fey at it, and get some higher caliber comedy actors in there. Or take it more dark/serious. Or something...I dunno. What they're doing now isn't working. 

"
Disjointed,">why is her son black?

*laugh track*

*clap track*

3 minutes in."
Disjointed,I liked it... but I am a trash person.
Disjointed,"Still not as bad as Amy Schumer, The Leather Special. "
Disjointed,"I'd never watched this before now, so I quickly put on the first episode after reading this thread.

I wanted to strangle myself after about 70 seconds."
Disjointed,"Am I the only one who's getting sick of Netflix's ""throw shit at the wall to see what sticks"" strategy? Their entire business model depends on creating content that people will pay to access. No one is paying to access this show, or Friends From College, or any of the other garbage they put out. Even if someone pays for one month because a big name like Bates or Key is in a project, they won't keep paying. 

Netflix had a good thing going for a few years with a handful of carefully selected, high quality shows. Now it seems like their goal is to throw chunks of money around until something spits it back."
Disjointed,Yeah. I saw this going about this well as soon as the trailer dropped.
Disjointed,"I think it's pretty alright. Perfect to put on when you are doing something else (reddit). 

It seems like the ideas and characters came from how life actually is as a stoner, but written by people who have never smoked weed or been around this part of the culture.  

Fun anecdote: 3/4 of the shop owners I have met have looked exactly like the lady in the show.

Edit: Ballbag. I forgot the show has a laugh track.  For some reason, Netflix thinks people want a laugh track.  Dear netflix, Nah brahh.  
"
Disjointed,Chuck Lorre is a hack
Disjointed,"watched while high, good laughs. I think it did what it set out to do. "
Disjointed,I dont get the hate. Sure it's cheesy but it actually has some funny moments. Gotta get past the awful first episode.
Disjointed,"Damn am I the only one that somewhat enjoyed it? I mean it was corny, and had too much going on with no real plot but nonetheless I enjoyed seeing an actual canabis industry related show. And I kind of liked the dude that talked to his plants in an Australian accent - that I will tack up to smoking too much while watching. None the less I'd like to see more canabis industry related stuff without it being like a documentary or something. Another TV show like Weeds from showtime would be freaking awesome. That's not going to be this show by any means though. 4/10 🤗"
Disjointed,*raises hand* I watched 7 episodes today and all I can say is that I wish the one serious plot line had been the main storyline. The animation of Carter's PTSD hallucinations and the struggle he goes through are the most heartfelt plot points in the entirety of the show.
Disjointed,Dunno about the show but everyone should check out the animation at the beginning of episode 9! 
Disjointed,"Dont tell anyone but I thought it was pretty good
Its not meant to be a documentary, you know
Also it deals with real shit in a way that its not taking itself seriously which I think is great"
Disjointed,Millennials are ruining Kathy Bates. 
Disjointed,"I'm going to play Devil's Advocate here and say that ""Disjointed"" is a show that is good for Cannabis. I hate laugh track comedy because I feel I should laugh at a joke, not be coerced into laughing when they want you to. 


That said, ""Disjointed"" is a show much like the creators other show ""Big Bang Theory"" where it is exposing a non-mainstream culture to the mainstream. It's also achieving that goal in an very Non-Threatening way. I've watched a bit here and there, and although the information is extremely basic and steeped in terrible jokes, it does educate. Again, in a very non-threatening way. I could see 40 something moms trying some pot after watching this show. "
Disjointed,Stopped watching 5 minutes in after hearing the laugh track.  Why kathy?
Disjointed,"I'm so confused by this show, I presumed the target demo netflix is trying to hit is 15-35 year old stoners. However, this is a new show from Chuck Lorre, who's previous success is on CBS, a network that aims for 35-55 year olds. It's almost as if Netflix approached him and say, ""Can you make us a show, but, like, make it edgy?"". (Because 50 year olds still think weed is edgy). Or maybe he tried to do this show at cbs, who passed, and netflix was like, ""Chuck Lorre shows are HUGE! Buy that shit now!"" before they even read a script."
Disjointed,"Wildly unpopular opinion: I thought it was actually pretty good. 


It was a rough pilot, especially since I don't like Chuck Lorre or laugh tracks or most sitcoms. Maybe it was just hard to get acclimated but I think it turned out pretty alright. 


I actually think they did a lot of brilliant things like the secret word transitions and radical stylistic shifts with Carter's (army vet) PTSD hallucinations (the art and claymation alone was worth it). 


It had fairly typical sitcom humor but I think it caught its stride and landed a lot better with the racier topics. I can't tell you how much every sitcom needs to be able to swear. And talk about feminism! 


And it was actually able to tackle some pretty great topics in that sitcomy way, like minors using weed, the feds and legit marijuana businesses, activism, and the actual health benefits of pot. Maybe this is run of the mill stuff and not that original, but I don't consume a lot of content that centers around weed and it seemed pretty great to me. 


I think people should actually watch a few episodes and not just base their opinions off a trailer or a few minutes of the pilot. There's really great parts of the show.



TLDR Give it a real chance. It's not the best, but it's got some good stuff too. "
Disjointed,"ITT a bunch of people criticizing something they watched less than 10% of. Oh you don't like the laugh track? Tell me how you feel about the insanely popular That 70's Show then. 

How many times have you showed someone a show but said ""its weak at the start but it gets better""? Yet here is a thread FULL of people who refused to even give it a chance after it started off weak. 

PS-there's insanely good animations of the psyche of the war veteran security guard, but they aren't in the first episode....people are missing out."
Disjointed,"I must be a fucking mongoloid, because it thought it was funny as fuck
"
Disjointed,Netflix has to put out better content if Disney is going to pull their content with NBC Universal and 21st century fox to follow. 
Disjointed,Just because it's reviewed poorly doesn't mean it won't be popular. See: Friends From College.
Disjointed,"You know what, I like the show.  It is a sitcom, with laugh track, and that can be off putting for some.  I burned through the series in a couple of days, and the characters do grow on you immensely.  "
Disjointed,I had hopes for this show. I guess they were just too......high ;)
Disjointed,"I stopped watching after the security guard had his PTSD moment and the show had a laugh track afterward. I have known too many people commit suicide because of there PTSD. 

Fuck this show. "
Disjointed,"According to the critics... I clearly see about half of the people posting here actually liked it, something tells me that the write up is biased as hell. 

Btw I watched the whole season and didn't mind it, there are far worse shows on Netflix. And it's a comedy tv show people not a documentary, it's not supposed to represent what happens at a real dispensary, that would be boring as fuck."
Disjointed,I didn't think it was that bad. It's a shitty TV show and smoking weed makes shitty TV shows better. Chill out everyone. 
Disjointed,I call bullshit. This show is actually pretty good.
Disjointed,Disjointed is soooo bad. It's like it was written by people who've never even been in the same room as weed. 
The Mist,"I hope [the kite-like creature described in the novella](http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/stephenkingsthemist/images/f/f9/Kite_creature_5.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20140417140440) makes an appearance at some point, even if it's just in the distance. I was a little disappointed that so many of the ""otherworldly"" monsters just looked like big spiders."
The Mist,Why though? The movie itself was already great 
The Mist,imagine if HBO picked this up instead of Spike 
The Mist,"That movie ending, I have never been so depressed and pissed off at a single movie ending in my life, but at the same time absolutely amazed with it and that they had the balls to go with that.  It couldn't have ended any better. "
The Mist,"Pro Tip - This book was one of the influences for the game Half Life.

eg. A shady research facility creates a portal to another dimension and unleashes untold nightmare creatures on the earth."
The Mist,I might be excited if literally any other network was doing it.
The Mist,"Woah, Spike is still a thing? "
The Mist,As long as they don't screw it up like they did The Dome.
The Mist,"I like the potential. With, say, 10 episode seasons? ... Okay, I was more bored than I thought. I present to you my six season treatment for the The Mist TV series.

**Season 1** - Another perspective inside the same town when the mist first appears, including several military members helping the group, a couple of scientists from the base (working on teleportation), and some normal people. End of the season we discover the mist isn't gone, but split. There are now two mists, and traveling apart.

**Season 2** - The mists travel the globe, much like the spot on Jupiter. They're permanent fixtures in pop culture, and new homes and apartments are built with bomb shelters for cellars. Infrastructure and hard-wiring are important again. We're a hardened society. We follow the same military members and a survivor or two from the previous season who are now part of a clearance/survival team in the American mist that go ahead of it and help people prepare, and sit it out when need be. They're attached by another military group who appears to be traveling with the mist, hiding inside it, killing people who see them (we don't see the victims well) and leaving agents as ""survivors"". The second mist travels the current and hits Europe. Our team of s01 survivors thinks they've won, but are worried about the other military group. That knowledge becomes top secret.

**Season 3** - After hitting NYC and killing tens of thousand, the American mist shifts abruptly and heads toward Washington DC, catching everyone unaware. Half of the s01 survivors are working the other mist in Eurasia, but half are now the extraction team for the First Family. Given the turn, they wonder if mists are being controlled. They discover the other military group is attempting to kill American leaders. The ""double agent"" from last season won a seat in Congress based on his campaign of funding ""solving the problem"", not ""preparing Americans to live with it"", and he's spared. Season ends with the President dying, saving his family. A bittersweet moment, but he sacrifices himself.

**Season 4** - A simultaneous story of those stuck in DC, where the mist hasn't moved in months. And a SEAL team hunting a mobile base inside the Eurasian mist. One story is defense, the other is offense, in these alien-like spots on Earth. We discover something from the other side of the mists is making it seem like a foreign nation is attacking us. The overseas team is captured. The Old Ones have returned, they've already infiltrated another world's government, and they are placing themselves among us, and several are now impersonating high ranking politicians. And they have a plan to ""solve the problem"". The American mist s01 team saves the agent and other politicians. They've instantly been elevated in Congress thanks to others' deaths.

**Season 5** - The ""Manhattan Project"" solution is in place, and in episode 2 or 3, after a fun first episode they set it off. It disperses the mists! ... And after a few days (later that episode), after a parade and celebration... It appears around the world in several locations, enveloping the character's instant surroundings in hours. Next episode we find out days later, it's covered the world. We kick into Armageddon. The world is now covered in the mist, and billions are dead. We still follow our s01 heroes as they fight for their lives, trying to get to a ship to get out to sea, where they hope it's safe. When they arrive, they see it's not. Still mist, as far as the eye can see. So they consider flying above it, so they go to the airport. Surely they can find an airplane at JFK (or some notable airport.) When they get there, another plane crash lands. From it spills the other half of the s01 team, from Eurasia. They've been to the other side, they've escaped, and they have a plan to regain control of the mist.

**Season 6** - Final. Reveal all the secrets. It's a portal from another world, and they've found out more about how it works, and plan to shut it down. Lots of crazy awesome action, travel to the other world, and finally changing the target from Earth to Jupiter. The spot disappears, as it's sucked into the portal, and onto the other world. Humanity is now alive, fighting to regain control of its planet from the existing creatures, still hunting agents in their midst, and in control of rudimentary teleportation technology.

Just don't get me started on my Running Man pitch."
The Mist,The entire series was just prepping us for having too many vaping friends 
The Mist,I think it could be cool. It would be interesting if they expanded on how people adjust to the new world and the type of threats they face.
The Mist,Dang I read The Mist and immediately thought of the PC game Myst. Then I read the rest and my hopes went down
The Mist,Does it need to be though? King himself enjoyed the movie ending more than his own book
The Mist,"It was a short story, not a book.  Night Shift I think, possibly Skeleton Crew was the book"
The Mist,"Me and my friend walked like four miles in the rain to see this movie one night and when it was over I was silent. He turns to me and says ""patience is a virtue.""

Totally worth it. "
The Mist,Why not Myst? 
The Mist,Carol's (from the walking dead) adventure to get back to her children when nobody's bitch ass from the store would help her when she was asking for it.
The Mist,Would be cool if it followed a different group each episode. 
The Mist,oh god that annoying lady again!!!
The Mist,"Probably gonna get downvoted for this, but I remember sitting through this movie thinking it was really sterile. I didn't think the acting was very good; the dialogue was stale and the creature animation reminded me of a comedy sci-fi - like the film Evolution or something. I thought the cast had a soap-opera look to them (though maybe that was a combo of the make up & lighting) and it just came off as a 'made for TV affair'.

Then that ending came and wow! Single-handedly saved the entire film for me. It took real balls to do that. So many better movies that I was comparing it to as I watched, had actually copped out with weak endings to 'satisfy the audience'. This movie was like those others in reverse. I still love this film for doing that, though probably not enough to watch it again. Maybe I should though, to see if I was too hard on the first two-thirds at the time.
"
The Mist,"It could work. Maybe they're looking for a WAlking Dead type scenario with a certain town, or towns overrun with all kinds of monsters (instead of zombies) from the Mist."
The Mist,"Happy this is coming to TV, bummed that its not an HBO series"
The Mist,I hope this time we will have actual explanation and visual of what is happening.
The Mist,I hope that series follows the exploits of a scientist who witnessed the accident that brought the Mist into our world.
The Mist,"This has potential. I loved the idea that it wasn't so much Grrrr-arg-murder-kill-kill-death monsters, but just a clash of two ecosystems (great invasive species analogy). What else came through? Did they resolve the rift, or just contain it? Is anyone going to check out the other side? Is the rift spreading? How are species from our world interacting with the new ones?  If there are good writers the possibilies for meaningful material is endless. "
The Mist," The movie was awesome, hope they don't fuck it."
The Mist,"This is completely pointless.  The book is less than 150 pages long,  and already had a movie. There's just not enough content in the book to make a multi-episode TV series. It's been a while since I've read the book and seen the movie,  but I remember the movie following the book very faithfully until the changed ending. I'd rather see a TV series adaptation of The Dark Tower.  "
The Mist,"I am hoping they do a serialized version of the ending from the novela. The search for a safe haven, and exploring to find the edge of the mist.
I also hope they have a story arc overall, in that while they search, the explore, and eventually find the source of the mist (Project Arrowhead) and somehow cut it off. 

Bonus: And here's my in-novella theory for how the protagonist's wife (and mother to his son) is alive and they are reunited....

There's a scene in the novella where the protagonist, son, and neighbor are leaving his house (for the supermarket), and they pass a power-company repair truck on the way. I imagine that the power truck, which was heading towards the mist, encounters some trouble with the creatures (lead creatures who aren't as deadly?), and returns, rescues the wife on the way past the house, and continues on out of the area in a rush. Later she is reunited with her husband and son. Maybe to counter-trope, she rescues the power-repair person, and leaves the area with them?

Anyway, I thought it was an interesting idea of how there is a hint, or potential, for the story to have an in-canon reference to her surviving..."
The Mist,I'm ridiculously happy to learn something like this will happen. 
The Mist,I'd be hyped if it wasn't spike 
The Mist,"The movie was just about perfect, the ending is even better than the book. Even King said so."
The Mist,[deleted]
The Mist,"Awesome, I just hope they consult King. I loved the book, and the movie, so I have high hopes for a TV show."
The Mist,"If they do a good job (crossing my fingers), maybe they can do a Silent Hill TV series. 

I always thought the two were kind of similar in tone. "
The Mist,"It's like the walking dead, but with bugs. The movie had 3 or so actors from twd."
The Mist,I'd rather have a show based on the game Myst!
The Mist,The movie was so-so. I just don't see this being very interesting.
The Mist,"The movie was great and the ending was one of the greatest movie endings ever, I just can't find myself caring about this at all. And spike making it doesn't help any. And that means less re runs of cops :("
The Mist,I got all excited then I realized its the wrong kind of mist.  The not good one.
The Mist,"Stephen King has a huge pile of novels, novellas and short stories out there and they chose to adapt this again?"
The Mist,I wonder if they'll tell the story about David Drayton's wife and what happened to her; she stayed behind at the cottage while her husband and son went into town for supplies. 
The Mist,the series is going to be complete dog shit. flashbacks out the ass every episode. everybody's shitty boring background story will be fleshed out to filler the show. 
The Mist,This movie parallels Cloverfield's storyline.. yet this book is 31 years old now. I was hoping this film and Cloverfield having a prequal would show some sort of portal of where scientist crossed over.  Right now Cloverfield is having a sequal I guess to hold us over for a prequal if ever plans to come out. 
The Mist,There better be a lot of goddamn monsters..... i like monsters..
The Mist,"Wow, is the TV show going to be a depressing bummer too?"
The Mist,Ugh it better not be as bad as the dome tv show. Man that was terrible. Love The Mist with Thomas Jane.
The Mist,I would really like it to explore the origin of the Mist and all the crazy experiments the Army was working on. 
The Mist,"If it follows the whole thing from the military side, that would be interesting. "
The Mist,One of my favourite movies. Looking forward to this.
The Mist,"Article says The Stand, It, and Dark Tower are in development. I thought all those projects were stalled?"
The Mist,where is our Tommyknockers adaptation?
The Mist,"Personally I've always thought a story about humanity adapting to live in the new ""Mistworld"" would be neat."
The Mist,Better if it was Myst...
The Mist,What elements of the 2007 film have not aged well?
The Mist,"It's amazing that in this golden age of television it's not what you can watch but when can I watch.

Since there are so many good shows and movies to choose from these days."
The Mist,oh well it's too bad Xfinity decided to randomly rob me of this channel!
The Mist,"So basically, The Walking Dead with mist-spiders.  

Band of protagonists who constantly in-fight trying to survive a shambling, mobile horde of supernatural man-eaters.

I don't even like it on The Walking Dead.  Why would I want to Mad-Lib the same story with a different monster?"
The Mist,I liked the book and the movie.
The Mist,Why is Spike Lee of all people doing this?
The Mist,I was hoping OP misspelled Myst.
The Mist,"I hope it's awesome, and doesn't turn into a Walking Dead type show, but with monsters instead."
The Mist,Brilliant! Hope it's as well made and written as Under the Dome........
The Mist,"For me, this was the best horror movie ever made.  This sounds great, hopefully they do it well, but could we get HBO to do it instead?"
The Mist,Where is the myst tv show we really want?
The Mist,"If this lasts for more than a season, and it ends the same way as the movie, it's gonna be even more depressing...."
The Mist,">stephen king's book


it was an especially well contained short story that was adapted into an especially well contained movie. 


not sure how they think its wise to take such a specifically limited scope, 10 year old story and turn it into an ongoing series, but who am i to doubt the brilliant minds that brought us bar rescue, manswers, and the blade series starring sticky fingaz?"
The Mist,"Not gunna watch. At least, not at first.

TV executives will probably want to make a 'repetitive weekly episodic melodrama' like they did out of *Under the dome*."
The Mist,I hope it doesn't just end up copying /r/thephenomenon from Reddit. 
The Mist,"wwwhhhhyyyy. Why always the mist. 

He has so much other stuff to draw from and you choose to redo something that was already done. 

Do Strawberry Spring. Do the Jaunt. DO SOMETHING ORIGINAL.

"
The Mist,"Desperately underrated movie. I can't imagine the TV series will take place in that grocery store, though. Hopefully it follows new characters while they try to survive outside."
The Mist,"You know, I was just thinking that would be a great TV show, maybe even make it an anthology where different bugs do crazy shit to different people in each episode, maybe you could even have a parasite bug that mind controlled people and got them to do crazy shit before their head exploded or something.

Read my mind Spike."
The Mist,When will this air?
The Mist,"Well we already know that the ending will be horrible, so there's that."
The Mist,The movie sucked
The Mist,"Awwwww Hell No lol That shit would be just too scary.

And it wouldn't be the same without ""Crazy Church Lady"" lol

People stood up and clapped in the theaters lol
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYr0Jz-rTY0"
The Mist,Well this is going to suck
The Mist,"I'm excited because they'll likely use the movie's ending since King apparently loved it.

Also, there's the chance that if it does well there could be more pressure to push the Dark Tower movies into production due to the tie-in."
The Mist,lets hope the inevitable series finale at the end of the 13th and final episode isn't as disappointing as the ending of the film.
The Mist,"After reading this thread i am shocked that people actually enjoyed the ending to the mist movie.

I felt the ending completely ruined an otherwise interesting movie.  In fact, the ending as so god awful that I rate the mist in my top 10 worst movies of all time.

Shocking yes, but the ending sucked the wind out of the entire movie up till that point.  It truly was a twist that didn't need twisting.  Had they left that off and rather just had the car stall with the monsters coming in on the family to have them saved by the military that would have been better in my opinion.  To have the movie end on a ""you thought you did the right thing but little did you know seconds later you were abhorrently wrong,"" was such a bitter awful pill to swallow."
The Mist,Not one of the best King novellas.  A TV series based on it would just be The Walking Dead with creatures rather than zombies.
The Mist,Just remember what other works king had done that have been adopted for TV   They're  usually awful. His better stuff had always been on the big screen 
The Mist,another King miniseries? The previous ones were terrible.
The Mist,"ENOUGH WITH THE REMAKES ALREADY!

There are millions of lesser-known and self-published books that have never been made into TV series."
The Mist,Awesome.  I hope a religious nut bag gets one between the eyes.
The Mist,Will it be just as shitty as the movie?
The Mist,I personally can't wait to see this gritty origin story of a beloved Pokemon character.
The Mist,oh deer god
The Mist,Fun Fact: The whole cast from the original The Mist movie went on to play on The Walking Dead.
The Mist,[deleted]
The Mist,Cthulhu as a kite!? I like it. 
The Mist,"Makes me think of that one part in Half Life where you exit the pipe into the canyon and see the fighter jets chasing the flying alien things

Although, Half Life was inspired by the story to some extent"
The Mist,"I think that's why they did it, most people have a fear of spiders "
The Mist,Money
The Mist,So? Fargo was a great movie as well... But I'm glad they made a TV series as well.
The Mist,"The book was only 134 pages long, nearly every page was covered in the movie, nothing was left out. On top of that, the movie was a step better than the book, so what the hell is the show going to be about? "
The Mist,"Agreed. The problem with TV-ifying King stories is they drag out the plot to fill the hours instead of getting to the good stuff. Under The Dome went on for so long that I tuned out and gave up.

The movie version of The Mist was great. Do we really need 15+ hours to rehash a perfectly great short story and movie? No.

I adore King's stories but there is so much original material out there. I wish we weren't given the same stuff on a continuous loop.

But I suppose the known stuff sells..."
The Mist,"So they can have their own Walking Dead serial show. This will be a survivor vs. monster fest, and hopefully a good one. 

It's likely they'll focus on a sheltered-group and those-seeking-shelter-shelter group/groups."
The Mist,"The real question is, are they going to stick with the superior movie ending or go with the inferior book ending?"
The Mist,I assume it will be Spike's the Walking Dead.
The Mist,The movie says it all period. Idk what plot line they want to expound. Maybe the religious cult fanaticism and make it into a tribal council to decide who gets sacrificed?
New Game!,"My wife just watched it and said this is exactly what its like being a teacher: 

""I literally just told you that""."
New Game!,"Jimmy breaking down at the tax scandal question is one of the funniest things I’ve seen in a while … the contestants on the second episode were so bad, especially since the first episode’s contestants were a lot better at it."
New Game!,ha HA^aa
New Game!,"My opinion of Jimmy Carr has varried quite a bit over the years. But honestly, he was made for hosting these cheesy wholesome British comedy shows. I find he brings just the right version of edginess (or whatever you want to call his humour) that can be biting but isn’t really insulting."
New Game!,"Shop til you Drop does questions this way.

I was on it and the answers/question were:

""Prison, High School, or Canada - where did William Shatner spend the first 20\* years of his life?""

To which my roommate replied: ""Prison."" I wanted to slap him.

Then the girl we were against said ""High School."" I was grateful, but I wanted to slap her, too.

So I got the answer correct with ""Canada"" but holy shit it never should have gotten back to my turn.

\*I forget the actual number. It may have been 22 or 24 or something similar."
New Game!,"I was waiting for the last girl to answer ""Venus"" and Jimmy just give a pained laugh as he just mumbles out ""I fucking quit"""
New Game!,"[Watch the whole episode here](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=hwKmt4nZ1dc)

This show is absolute madness, and really embarrassing for the contestants"
New Game!,"The look of that poor lady doing the questions. She looks so distraught- like she can’t decide if she should feel bad that she’s giving too hard questions, or she should feel bad that they are doing so poorly at such easy ones"
New Game!,I haven't seen Jimmy Carr's face move this much for a decade.
New Game!,Maggie is going to regret being on this one.
New Game!,I can already envision this being adapted for the U.S.
New Game!,"OK, I thought I was going to have some sympathy because I'm the kind of person who forgets information I've learned by the very next conversation (especially names) but holy shit those answers are laughably bad."
New Game!,Love Jimmy!
New Game!,"I know what's happening here.

Sean Lock, having been released from his battle with cancer, has made a brief stop on his way to comedy heaven.

He's decided to subtly influence the minds of the contestants in order to bring Jimmy to tears in a way that nobody else ever could.

Watch it again, and imagine Sean Lock's voice for every stupid thing that's being said, followed by that big grin of his."
New Game!,SNL jeopardy vibes
New Game!,I was so sure she was going to say Venus there at the end.
New Game!,"The Game Boy answer is what I don't like about some game shows. The correct answer they said was the 1980s but the contestant said the 1990s. According to Wikipedia it was released in 1990 in the EU (so the UK), but was 1989 in Japan and the US. Given no other context then either of these answers are reasonable, given this is a UK programme. It's exactly why better quiz shows add qualifications constantly to specify stuff like this - just say ""originally released"" rather than ""released"" and it's fine."
New Game!,"Jesus christ, that Irish guy was something else...I'm not entirely sure he understood how the show worked. 

The girl in the wheelchair wasn't quite as bad but the girl who won didn't even realise she had won..."
New Game!,"For everyone shitting on these people, imagine being on national television in front of potentially millions of people being expected to remember things mentioned in passing maybe 10 or 20 minutes previously, possibly even longer.

This is the game show equivalent of those ""man on the street"" segments where they single out the dumbest answers out of the hundreds of people they approached.

Funny premise but you all gotta consider how the sausage is made."
New Game!,Jimmy has a new face!
New Game!,Fantastic. I will be watching this.
New Game!,"Is this the first ever *anti*-quiz show?

They're fucking idiots."
New Game!,"Distraction was peak Jimmy Carr, and one of the peak British game shows. You'd never be able to do it in the same way these days"
New Game!,Are they dumb? or is this just what happens when a normal person has to listen to Jimmy Carr for the amount of time it took to shoot this.
New Game!,[deleted]
New Game!,tf happened to his hair?? He's sporting a normal person haircut now instead of his standard ventriloquist dummy look
New Game!,Jimmy Carr's standup comedy is epic. This is funny but isn't close lol
New Game!,"Is the idea for this show simply that some millionaire comic sophisticate with years of experience in media gets together a bunch of regular, but nervous people with no media training  at all and makes fun of them relentlessly?

Because that kind of casual cruelty is something only the British would be amused by."
New Game!,[deleted]
New Game!,Thanks for introducing me to this op
New Game!,"The show is better the dumber the people are.

That second episode had my sides hurting from how hard I was laughing."
New Game!,I’m a teacher and that is exactly what I thought while watching it. Then I showed it to my wife and said “this is what it’s like being a teacher.” I would imagine there’s a lot of that going around.
New Game!,"Amenn. Will be pointing to it, actively saying it, still a blank stare."
New Game!,"Teachers gotta remember that students 

A, don’t listen at all, like I could look you in the eye and not listen to a word you just said and 

B if you explain something and then ask a question, sometimes we don’t get the connection which is completely obvious to you, a 34 year old who has done this about 60 times in 15 years."
New Game!,"Well do you think those students are stupid?

I personally really don’t like the slant of this show that the contestants are morons, when a lot of people completely blank out information under performance pressure or anxiety, and maybe even ADD for example. 

It just exploits and reinforces a lot of the anxieties people have of being put on the spot, the whole video made me feel icky honestly"
New Game!,"I've literally just finished the 2nd episode, I have not laughed so hard at a gameshow before."
New Game!,Text you can hear
New Game!,he laughs in reverse
New Game!,"I came here to say it seems like he forgot to do his reversed smile.

I watched his new special yesterday and he laughed normally a couple of time too.

Now I'm wondering if the weird smile is fake or not..."
New Game!,"At this point he is literally *made* for these shows, with all the botox, hair plugs, and teeth whitening

(And openly jokes about this)"
New Game!,"They guy is brilliant. 

He certainly isn't a perfect role model. Not even close. 

But the episode of 8/10 cats after his tax scandal really showed how genuine he is. 

Don't get me wrong, there's a part of me that will always see him as a POS for thinking hes above the law. 

But that episode was nearly an hour of the cast just tearing into him, making home after joke after joke. Jon Richardson seemed genuinely pissed and didn't hold back. 

And for the entire episode, Jimmy just took the berating and accepted the fact that he more than deserved it all. He never once tried to justify what he did, and he apologized numerous times. 

He also mostly refrained from making jokes himself because he knew this was a time for him to be punished, not rewarded. 

At the end of the day, he's more of a genuinely good guy than he is a bad person."
New Game!,"As a yank, I think the satirical news show he did with David Mitchell, Charlie Brooker and Lauren Laverne was the epitome of amazing British humor."
New Game!,I think Jimmy is a much better host than comedian
New Game!,He played a large part in making the Inbetweeners reunion terrible
New Game!,Sarcasm?
New Game!,ootl. what baggage does he have?
New Game!,"That was one of my favorite game shows when I was little, along with Supermarket Sweep. How did you do on the show?"
New Game!,I was expecting Freddy.
New Game!,"""Snickers"""
New Game!,I probably would've shit myself laughing.
New Game!,I thought it was really forced that they kept on pretending the guy answered “a planet” instead of “a person” when it was clear he remembered the person’s last name was some kind of celestial body
New Game!,"Holy shit the ending is amazing.

""Have you just won £12,250?""

""...have I?"""
New Game!,Crazy to think this is just the 2nd episode and they already have moments like this.
New Game!,[deleted]
New Game!,So about when he decided to not pay taxes.
New Game!,I hope she enjoyed herself though.
New Game!,Steve Harvey is drooling at the chance.
New Game!,"I’m guessing there is testing that shows there is enough selective attention where people will forget these facts on a fairly regular basis, at least enough to have a show highlight the comedy in it.

It’s pretty crazy to think how memory filters like that."
New Game!,It's not fair to judge from these clips given that we see the answer not long before the question whereas they had god knows how many questions and how much time between them. That said....
New Game!,"The one lady was right, though, you just go blank when you're under pressure. Like you know how someone will ask ""So what do you like to do for fun?"" in an interview and you suddenly can't think of literally anything you've ever done in your entire life?

The other lady getting Richard Bacon's name right but thinking he was the answer was pretty weird, though."
New Game!,"I swear they must find people that watch absolutely no television and stay off the internet because at least 90% of the jokes about Jimmy Carr in any appearance of his, which are quite numerous, have to be about his tax scandal."
New Game!,What the fuck is this comment
New Game!,"At the same time 1990's had already been used as an answer for the first question

The game is that they give them the answers to the three questions coming up. And by the looks of that format in the video the three questions always use a different answer.

Game show theory should be directing them to the correct final answer that third time every time even if they don't know it (Maybe less so if the three questions were spaced out over the course of the show)"
New Game!,"If enough people write in, then sometimes the shows will make up for it. Like on some US game show a contestant got an answer wrong, but someone did the research and it was like this Gameboy question - whatever the product was had been released on a small scale like the decade before so their answer was correct since there was no qualifier."
New Game!,"They're not. They're nervous, combined with the pressure of trying to not look foolish would be really hard. The whole show also isn't recorded in ten minutes, or even the regular 22 minutes of runtime. They're probably there for hours and the questions being asked, that look like they happen a minute later, probably happened much later.

The hamster story, for example, probably took place like 30 minutes before the question was asked. I didn't remember the dudes name at the time in this clip either because I wasn't expecting his name to come up again."
New Game!,"His stand up is rubbish. He doesn't tell jokes just puns, one liners and school yard insults. He's genuinely funny but stand up is an art form that requires more than just being funny. 

His comedy is best when he has someone to bounce off of which is why this format best suits him. His most popular youtube clips are him destroying hecklers. Spontaneous reactions, not joke telling."
New Game!,"This was episode 2, people in episode 1 did fine and were pretty good at the game."
New Game!,"I mean... not regularly, they've only put out two episodes so far"
New Game!,I heard from someone that they watched this show and this is exactly what it's like being a teacher.  I forget who said that.
New Game!,"> A, don’t listen at all, like I could look you in the eye and not listen to a word you just said and
> 
> 

yeah I think that was the point.  
  
""damn students never listen!""  
""Well the thing you've got to understand is that students often don't listen""  
  
I think that post was another example of what it feels like to be a teacher."
New Game!,"We don't forget.

You're applying this piece of information to actual technical information.

I've had this sort of stuff from

Student comes up to me

""Can I go to the toilet?""

""Yeah just get back quickly""  (The longer statement is literally for this benefit)

""So can I go to the toilet?""

---

It's expected and understandable when you are teaching content, some people need repetition to let it sink in. But there are just some dumbfoundingly stupid interactions that a kid has initiated."
New Game!,Then why are those people going on a game show lol
New Game!,"I agree with what you're getting at when it comes to blaming students. Students get blamed for not remembering things that aren't relevant to them, when it's a teacher's job to overcome that and make it relevant (with kids, anyway). 

But I think that exploiting this human tendency in adults and for comedy is a good thing. You've zeroed in on the anxiety piece, but I think the show is a lot more about short-term memory (and *maybe* a universal anxiety). The fact that we only remember things that are relevant to us is funny when it's taken to an extreme and observed by a good comedian. I don't think it's mean-spirited at all, and this is coming from someone who thinks a lot of game shows have a gross, cynical bent. I mean, consider how almost everyone is wiping away tears at the end. I get where your interpretation comes from, so I don't think you should be so downvoted, but I disagree that it's exploitative."
New Game!,"Please, check out taskmaster if you haven’t. Another British show; it’s amazing and super funny."
New Game!,"To be fair, he is a puppet that noel operates"
New Game!,"I always thought those jokes were mildly exaggerated, but Jimmy legit looked like a Mortician had done his makeup on this years Cats Does Countdown Christmas Special."
New Game!,Walmart brand Brandon Flowers
New Game!,His best line in that episode was “well if I can say something in my defence….. nup I’ve got nothing”
New Game!,"
>Don't get me wrong, there's a part of me that will always see him as a POS for thinking hes above the law.

He didn't do anything illegal though."
New Game!,Do you happen to know which episode/season that was?
New Game!,"I saw him live a few years ago in Toronto, when he was doing his Netflix tour. Only about 25% of the show I saw was what was in the special, and the rest was all off the cuff. I laughed hard enough that I was in physical pain. He really did a lot of research on Toronto and made a lot of references to local stuff. He is a very good comedian."
New Game!,"Agreed. I think he's a very skilled comedian but he's just a complete natural as a host, and helps to elevate whatever program it is."
New Game!,"We won! I think we got a vacation to Hawaii and a rug doctor, lol."
New Game!,"I'm pretty sure he didn't want to make a stupid incorrect guess, so he gave an answer that was obviously not a genuine attempt to answer the question, in an attempt to not look stupid."
New Game!,"They most likely chose the airing order specifically for to have this one second, airing a sort of ""proper"" episode first to show what it is sort of supposed to be and the second one something to really get people talking and display the range of how crazy the show could be to build interest.

So it's not that it just happened to be only the second episode but rather they recorded a bunch and chose this to be the second."
New Game!,The show is likely a lot harder than it looks. Most game shows are. Pressure and anxiety contribute a lot more on camera than it does at home on your couch. A show like this is also more than likely edited down so there's a lot more to remember because you have no idea what's gonna be a question
New Game!,"She won that episode, her memory was generally okay."
New Game!,"Depends how their memory works though.

She might have a wicked visual memory and visualisation skill, but way less of words."
New Game!,"You have to remember litterally everything that has been said or show, including the introductions and fake as break because they could be the questions."
New Game!,I wonder if face lifts are tax deductible for an entertainer...
New Game!,"*laughing*

""You made yourself look like a damn fool on television! You said the wrong thing before the correct thing!

I feel no sense of irony in this statement!"""
New Game!,Oh please God no.
New Game!,Family feud is really the closest we have to a mainstream panel show isn't it
New Game!,"This.  But also, editing.  We're seeing them get the question about the information maybe 4-minutes of our-time after the info is first presented.  Who knows how much time has passed for the contestant."
New Game!,"users of r/ADHD would either do exceptionally well at this game...or do exceptionally poorly.

I didn't get anything right on this."
New Game!,Especially with the adrenaline of such a big new moment
New Game!,"Maybe, although this is from Episode 2, in Episode 1 the contestants were pretty good. Coupled with the fact this episode had videos of celebrities spouting off facts that were completely unused (aside from asking what show they're from) and I think they genuinely didn't expect the contestants to be so bad at the game they really did have to dumb it down halfway through."
New Game!,"And also, Jimmy has done this a few times on Countdown and BFQ and it's always hilarious."
New Game!,"Not too weird though.

They did have a question about him and being involved in a scandal. She just mixed up Jimmy's taxes (which I at least didn't hear a specific year being mentioned, just that subtracting 10 gets you into the 2000s) with him being tossed from Blue Peter."
New Game!,the answer is sometimes the same.  so you can't just use that line of logic.
The Good Place,"Will watch because: Chris O'Dowd

Still hoping for another IT Crowd reunion"
The Good Place,If you like O'Dowd give Moone Boy a watch.
The Good Place,"This is so exciting!! The pilot was actually filmed in my hometown almost a year ago and I got to be an extra on it. I hope I can see myself in the episode! (It look place at a carnival so I’ll be on the lookout for that scene)

Edit: At the time it was called [Zoltar](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8548836/) and was supposed to take place in the same universe as Tom Hanks’ “Big”."
The Good Place,Looking forward to it. Apple has been giving me a lot of hits lately
The Good Place,OP seems to only post about Apple+ content.
The Good Place,"Shrinking has been amazing too, Apple has some hits already"
The Good Place,I love that this show doesn’t premiere for 2 weeks but a dislike for the show in the article is that the season ends abruptly.
The Good Place,"“A small town is forever changed when a mysterious machine appears, promising to reveal everyone's true potential”

The premise makes me think of the video game Control. An Altered World Event with the “mysterious machine” being an Altered Item or Object of Power."
The Good Place,The Good Place was thought-provoking ? I enjoyed it but i might have missed something.
The Good Place,To be fair The Good Place wasn't exactly thought provoking.
The Good Place,well that’s a low bar
The Good Place,Good place was thought provoking?
The Good Place,"I see y’all have never seen Xavier Renegade Angel smh. Renegade Angels, arise up!"
The Good Place,"glad reviews coming in positive, the trailer wasn't the best but looks like it's worth checking out."
The Good Place,Another Apple TV banger? Sign me up
The Good Place,Anyone who feels similar better have watched Get Shorty. He was *fantastic* in that.
The Good Place,“a fire….. at a sea parks…?”
The Good Place,Heard that’s unable to happen due to a fire…..in sea parks?!
The Good Place,Have you tried turning it off and on again?
The Good Place,Anyone with kids who likes him should watch Puffin Rock on Netflix. It’s delightful.
The Good Place,Might be tricky given the show's creator being politically controversial.
The Good Place,Another? Did they do one that I missed?
The Good Place,Saw on IMDB he’s credited for 1 episode… despite being on the poster and heavily featured in the trailer 🤔🤔they better not be baiting and switching
The Good Place,"Oh nice, I was just looking at the cast and thought I didn't know anybody."
The Good Place,"Oh man, how good was the IT crowd?

I think the girl with glasses has a new Netflix show 
Cunk on earth 

Anyone seen it?"
The Good Place,Agreed I will give anything with him in it a go. Would kill for IT reunion.
The Good Place,"Phenomenal show! They were supposed to be making a US version of it, which I didn't see any way to make work."
The Good Place,The description there on IMDb doesn't match with the premise described in the article though.
The Good Place,Hey I was an extra on it too! I worked on it for a lot of the filming days and I even saw myself in this trailer! Catch me sitting in Chris O’Dowd’s classroom (to Jacob’s right)
The Good Place,What are your favorites?
The Good Place,Marketing departments don't do subtle anymore...
The Good Place,"That's true but his posts include [AppleTV+ becomes a joke on SNL](https://www.reddit.com/r/tvPlus/comments/10ub2ix/appletv_becomes_a_joke_on_snl/), [Liaison's first reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/tvPlus/comments/10yskwl/liaisons_first_reviews/) with two links total and both to negative reviews, and [Apple TV+ growth has 'flat-lined' as users say service lacks value](https://www.reddit.com/r/tvPlus/comments/11937w9/apple_tv_growth_has_flatlined_as_users_say/). There are a few other negative threads. Most others are just updates, announcements, and discussion threads related to Apple TV+.

So my impression is that he... is really into Apple TV+ and likes discussing it on Reddit?"
The Good Place,"During HOTD airing, i always talk about it. I must paid too then. LOL"
The Good Place,"Unfortunately I still don't get paid to watch TV and discuss this on Reddit.Yes, I like what Apple has done, but I'm one of the most critical of them (see the TVPlus sub; applefans tend to hate me). But if Tim Cook is around and wants to pay me to spread the word, please call me."
The Good Place,Could it be that’s all they have?
The Good Place,Ohhh
The Good Place,Check out Hello Tomorrow
The Good Place,They have been filming season 2 for a while now. It continues exactly where the finale ends. They seem to be very confident in this show’s success.
The Good Place,"You mean the show who’s entire premise revolves around the afterlife, theology and philosophy? Think you might be confusing it for a different show?"
The Good Place,I thought it explored a lot of philosophical concepts quite well.
The Good Place,Found the Jason Mandoza in the thread.
The Good Place,Don’t know what you’re talking about. It constantly brought up philosophical questions and moral dilemmas.
The Good Place,"> To be fair The Good Place wasn't exactly thought provoking.

name me any other broadcast network sitcom that gave in-depth philosophy lesson"
The Good Place,"I disagree, but you do you"
The Good Place,Seems this person didn’t have the requisite equipment for thoughts to be provoked…
The Good Place,Yes
The Good Place,"Yeah, that was weird watching ""Roy"" as a tough guy hitman.  But he *is* an actor, after all."
The Good Place,Does it end in a cliffhanger? I know it got cancelled.
The Good Place,"“What are you doing?”



“Watching porn”"
The Good Place,"Heh, well there is a very real reason why it probably won't happen."
The Good Place,Did you see that ludacris display last night?
The Good Place,I’m disabled!
The Good Place,"It really is. My boys used to watch that when they were little and I recognised the voice, made me sit down and watch with them."
The Good Place,"> politically controversial

Or in other words for his case, an utter cunt."
The Good Place,"yeeeeeaaaaahhhh... gonna steer clear of that, except to say that I still want an IT Crowd reunion"
The Good Place,"Oh no.

I just looked it up. What a gross dude."
The Good Place,Would be cool if they could make one without him.
The Good Place,"I guess, technically, ""The Internet Is Coming"" is the series finale"
The Good Place,Sometimes IMDb only credits people for episodes that have aired.
The Good Place,"After Moone Boy and Derry Girls I think the Irish are the only people that can get 90s nostalgia right. Maybe because the Good Friday Agreement is such a definitive point in their history.

The episode where he really wants a Megadrive felt like it was ripped from my memories."
The Good Place,"These two are very different shows, in terms of listed creator, plot, and even main character age. The name Deerfield is the only thing linking them as far as I can tell, but Big Door Prize is based on a book so there’s no logical way they shifted an original story into something they would have needed to secure the film rights for in advance, I think the original commenter is just a bit mixed up?"
The Good Place,Oh I know. I think when they pitched it to Apple they had to workshop a lot of the concepts scrapped the idea of it taking place in the same universe as Big. But I do specifically remember Chris O Dowd being on set and it taking place in a town called Deerfield much like where Big Door Proze takes place. It is also worth noting just this month they rebuilt the same set complete with the words “Deerfield” written all over it. So my best guess is they are either doing some reshoots or even gearing up for a season 2?
The Good Place,"Severance

The Good Place,Severance fucking slaps.
The Good Place,For All Mankind
The Good Place,Plenty of shills do it for free
The Good Place,He tooks his doctors advice too seriously
The Good Place,*Shill* + **Marketing Department** there are NO other explanations. ^/s
The Good Place,You post in other subs about other stuff though. Op only posts about Apple+ stuff in TV threads. That's weird.
The Good Place,It's possible.
The Good Place,Haven’t heard favourable reviews for that. Do you recommend it?
The Good Place,Nice you like it? The premise seems cool and I like that actor a lot but wasn’t sure if it had the legs to be interesting for a whole season or more
The Good Place,"Nah i’m just dumber than you guys, sorry"
The Good Place,I guess it’s less thought-provoking if you do not believe in the afterlife and if you believe religions are one of the worst things that happened to mankind.
The Good Place,You’re not alone it was absolutely deeper than the surface level masturbation jokes.. and that’s what made it good.
The Good Place,The peeps chili was deep.
The Good Place,Bortles!!!!!
The Good Place,that’s not synonymous with thought provoking necessarily
The Good Place,"What in-depth philosophical lesson did you learn from The Good Place? 

Genuine question, I'm glad it meant something to you. I clearly wasn't part of the target audience, so I'm interested to hear your point of view."
The Good Place,"A downvote is to be expected, but a personal insult over the content of a TV show is a little gauche. 

I merely found the pseudo ecclesiastical theorising a little on the nose, the conundrums and indeed the consequences equally blunt and the moralising eventually became predictable. 

Sure it started off fun, and the casting was good, but the stretching of a one series concept just weakened the 'thought provoking' from the obvious to the mildly dull. 

But I'm glad you enjoyed it and my thoughts on the show are in no way meant to attempt to diminish that enjoyment or to insult you. After all, that is exactly why so many shows are produced, and that can only be a good thing if we all find something we like."
The Good Place,"It does end open-ended and they clearly left it open for more possible seasons, but I remember the conclusion being satisfactory. It wasn't a big cliffhanger or the like, so I doubt it'd spoil your viewing experience. Don't let it stop you!"
The Good Place,"For people out of the loop:

Graham Linehan, the shows creator went off the fucking deep end arguing with trans people on twitter as JK Rowling did but without him being a billionaire, which he admits ""consumed my life"" to such a point that he started embracing anti-vax and anti-climate change points of view because the only people still agreeing with him held those views too.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graham_Linehan#Anti-transgender_activism

It got so bad that he vowed never to work with Channel 4 ever again, who broadcast his 3 major shows (Black Books, Father Ted and IT Show) because they took down 1 episode of the IT Show due to its trans storyline, and then vowed never to work with the BBC because they had a lesbian couple with a trans person in some kids show.

So he pretty much burned his relationship with 90% of the UK market for his type of work and made sure the other 10% was very unlikely to touch him, leaving him with his twitter rants and trying to influence foreign elections in favour of nutcase anti-trans candidates like he did with the 2022 Australian federal election in which he thought Australians would care who he thought they should vote for."
The Good Place,Sports!

The Good Place,"I mean, that's fair. Fun show."
The Good Place,And a Travel Man ep
The Good Place,Show doesn’t premier until the 29th and many cast members credited with 10 episodes.
The Good Place,"It seems like this show [might have used ""Zoltar"" as a codename](https://appleinsider.com/articles/22/02/14/apple-tv-transforms-town-for-zoltar-like-comedy-big-door-prize), which could be creating the confusion between this and the supposed show set in the Big universe."

The Good Place,What about Trying?
The Good Place,No Foundation?
The Good Place,Gotta throw Hello Tomorrow in there
The Good Place,Acapulco!
The Good Place,"Looks like someone still needs to watch Trying, Servant and For All Mankind! Honestly my top three Apple shows I think. You have goodness yet to come."
The Good Place,Prehistoric Planet... WeCrashed... The Essex Serpent...
The Good Place,"Seriously. Apple TV+ is our most watched streaming service. I canceled HBOMax. Soon will be Netflix I think, my shows are dwindling on Netflix. 

Did you watch Foundation? It’s fun. Not as good as the books, but it was just season one, I’m hopeful season two will be even better, even though I enjoyed the first season quite a bit."
Marvels The Defenders,I never thought netflix original can leave Netflix...
Marvels The Defenders,Daredevil Season 4!
Marvels The Defenders,"Big news. Wouldn't be shocked if they end up on Disney+ International, and Hulu domestically."
Marvels The Defenders,"Wonder  how long for  daredevil, it was back on trending and popular after Spider-Man NWH"
Marvels The Defenders,"Shit, I better finish DD s3 then..  I had assumed they'd always be there given that Netflix helped make them. Glad I have JJ s1 on Blu-ray at least."
Marvels The Defenders,"Fingers crossed for a Daredevil announcement this year along with a Kingpin after credits scene in Spider-Man 4. Setting up the Spider-Man / Daredevil team-up in Spider-Man 5. 

I would love to see Punisher and Jessica Jones return as well."
Marvels The Defenders,All I have left is 5 more Punisher episodes and the 3rd season of Jessica Jones. Guess I better hurry up.
Marvels The Defenders,"I'm happy I finally watched Daredevil a couple months ago. Very good show, better than any of the Disney+ Marvel shows."
Marvels The Defenders,You gotta be kidding me … I just recently started to watch Daredevil and have only so far watched the first two seasons and realized that I need to watch all the other shows + the Defenders before continuing with season 3 (spoiled myself by watching episode 1 of season 3 already because I didn’t know). Never gonna make it till march 1
Marvels The Defenders,"Probably would've been a lot better if they titled it ""Daredevil, Luke Cage, Iron Fist, Jessica Jones, Punisher; leaving Netflix on March 1st."" 

People reading the headline will think they're just removing ""The Defenders"" and that show was dogshit so no one really cares."
Marvels The Defenders,How am I going to do my 5th rewatch of Iron Fist?
Marvels The Defenders,That's a huge loss for Netflix.
Marvels The Defenders,"What a coincidence… I’m leaving Netflix on March 4

Watched everything I wanted to, and since price is jumping up to $185 a year, I’m dumping it."
Marvels The Defenders,"The article has been updated ""Netflix has confirmed to us that the series will be departing Netflix on  
 March 1st and that the rights have reverted back to Disney."""
Marvels The Defenders,Those one-shot hallway fights were the best superhero fight scenes I’ve ever seen.
Marvels The Defenders,"What!? But it’s a Netflix original..,"
Marvels The Defenders,Welcome to an all digital future
Marvels The Defenders,"What are they doing with punisher. So much blood in that show.

It’s my favorite too."
Marvels The Defenders,Thank god I have Daredevil season 1 and 2 on bluray. Still pissed they never released 3 on bluray but guess ill get a bootleg until another service saves it
Marvels The Defenders,"Oh The Defenders SHOWS. I thought The Defenders was leaving and I was like ""who the hell cares""? That was some shitty effort collaboration, at the level of Justice League. 

But Daredevil and Jessica Jones (well season 1 of JJ, I don't even remember season 2 if it had one), had a lot of good in them. 

I do wonder how much those shows draw viewers to this day? The 2 I mentioned, not the Shitfist and Luke Rage Cage, that was a missed opportunity to cast Kyle Gass."
Marvels The Defenders,The fuck? They better end up somewhere else. I have the first two seasons of Daredevil on Blu-ray but they stopped releasing them on home media.
Marvels The Defenders,Netflix did marvel a lot better than the rest
Marvels The Defenders,"Am I having a stroke or does this part of the article make no sense: 
> Where will The Defenders shows stream on Netflix next?"
Marvels The Defenders,"Actually, Daredevil, Iron First, Jessica Jones,  Luke Cage and The Punsher are all leaving March 1st...  Talk about burying the lede!"
Marvels The Defenders,Is it worth watching tho? Wondering if I should watch it before it leaves Netflix for good.
Marvels The Defenders,"Fuck sake, I literally started watching Daredevil the other week. I'm on S2 at the moment."
Marvels The Defenders,"Yeah. This would make sense. If Disney revives daredevil or any other, the fans would expect it to pick up where the former left off. If Netflix shelves those it effectively makes it harder for Disney because no one can just go and watch the first seasons."
Marvels The Defenders,"This sucks, I came in rather late on these shows and I really enjoyed them; so much so that I dropped the DC CW shows after watching them for years, it was such a shift in production values.  I'd watched a lot, but still have a ways to go: 2 seasons of Jessica Jones, and 1 each of Daredevil, Luke Cage, Iron Fist and the Punisher.  I knew Netflix had only licensed these shows, but still figured they had awhile yet before they were leaving.  Hoping Hulu or Disney Plus adds them shortly after they leave Netflix."
Marvels The Defenders,I didn’t even know that Netflix Originals could leave the platform :(
Marvels The Defenders,Daredevil was excellent
Marvels The Defenders,"Disney, at the bottom of this?"
Marvels The Defenders,"Oh hell I'm not even done watching them all the first time. I JUST finished S1 Iron Fist last night, on to The Defenders next. I hope they get to D+ soon after."
Marvels The Defenders,Please give me punisher 😭
Marvels The Defenders,"I'm totally fine with Disney trying to get everything Marvel in one place. I hope it's Disney+ and not Hulu, but either works; I'm just hoping for an R-rated section on Disney+."
Marvels The Defenders,I loved the Punisher. Exactly the kind of show I want to see. Guess I'm gonna have to get a copy before it goes away
Marvels The Defenders,"end of an era, ironfist s1 was probably the worst of the bunch but the others were good to great"
Marvels The Defenders,Of course right when I get into watching these shows again. I’m getting they’ll end up on disney +?
Marvels The Defenders,"They’re the only reason I got Netflix. 

I am tempted to drop it now. It stinks because only afew seasons were ever put out on physical media."
Marvels The Defenders,"They’re going to Disney+ though right? I just started Daredevil recently, for obvious reasons, and I’m having a blast."
Marvels The Defenders,"Once I found out the Netflix marvel series are officially Canon I decided to watch them all in order, just started daredevil s3 so hopefully I finish that, punisher s2 and Jessica Jones s3 before they're all pulled lol"
Marvels The Defenders,Are people just getting the Disney will remove the Marvel shows from Netflix?  That was the reason why Netflix stop making those shows because one day the deal will expire and the shows will go back to Disney.
Marvels The Defenders,Wtf. That’s all the lead up I get?! I’m halfway through Daredevil seasons and wanted to watch that plus other MCU shows on Netflix. Now I less than 3/4 of a month. Make Streaming Great Again.
Marvels The Defenders,I just wanna say a big fuck you to Disney for this.
Marvels The Defenders,But those are Netflix originals right?
Marvels The Defenders,"And this is why streaming sucks. If Disney buys them and takes them down, they can choose not to put them back up, ever."
Marvels The Defenders,Disney doesn’t like sharing its toys
Marvels The Defenders,"I forgot they even existed tbh. None of them got a second watch from me, and only a couple of them were watched the whole way through. I do like that they were trying to do shows that don’t constantly have the fate of the entire world in the balance, cause that does get old now and then."
Marvels The Defenders,"Netflix don't own the properties, ABC studios produced it for them. A lot of Netflix originals will eventually leave the platform since they don't own them."
Marvels The Defenders,Can they make sure Iron Fist gets lost and never arrives anywhere?
Marvels The Defenders,Welp. (Cracks knuckles) Time to find a pirate source for the entirety of Jessica Jones.
Marvels The Defenders,"Lmao! I just started rewatching Daredevil to show it to my GF who hasn't seen it before. We're working through the entire MCU, and The Defender shows are the only ones we haven't seen. Hopefully they'll show up on Disney+ sooner rather than later."
Marvels The Defenders,Going to d+?
Marvels The Defenders,"Wait so, all of the shows are going to be gone?? Has it been announced yet if those shows are going to be moving to another platform??"
Marvels The Defenders,"Excuse me?

Maybe it'll come to Disney+."
Marvels The Defenders,"Daredevil is definitely worth watching. Jessica Jones Season 1 is also phenomenal, the other two seasons are decent. The rest of the shows range from forgettable to just plain bad"
Marvels The Defenders,"Its a netflix prod, how come it leave netflix ? Its a different deal than the Daredevil ?"
Marvels The Defenders,Nooooo Netflix/disney is in dolby vision but hulu isn’t
Marvels The Defenders,[deleted]
Marvels The Defenders,"### Netflix has for years has always been a service you subscribe to for one month a year to binge, any more and its a waste. They lost the everyday watch in the background content years ago"
Marvels The Defenders,Bye Felicia
Marvels The Defenders,"No. Stop. Come back. 

Oh darn, well we tried guys."
Marvels The Defenders,Let it die. I feel like it was the catalyst for Marvel not wanting to renew it's Netflix contract even with Disney+ around the corner.
Marvels The Defenders,Disney playing fucking hardball here… bunch of assholes
Marvels The Defenders,Very glad I pirate instead of paying for movies and tv because of the carousel of licencing which happens it feels like every few weeks shows switch streaming services.
Marvels The Defenders,why would disney do that? They said that they dont count them as canon so why add it on D+
Marvels The Defenders,While the comic run wasn't too popular the structure of secret defenders could be cool. Dr Strange assembling a small team to tackle the occult.
Marvels The Defenders,"I wonder how long until they arrive on D+ (outside the US)? And even then, on my device I'll be stuck with 1080p SDR instead of the 4K HDR stream Netflix gives me. Even as someone with both services, this makes my viewing experience objectively worse."
Marvels The Defenders,"In addition from Daredevil and the first season of Luke Cage, this was a solid show IMO.  Didn't get bogged down into much single character crap."
Marvels The Defenders,"Hey Defenders, can you take Iron Crap with you on your way out? Thanks!"
Marvels The Defenders,Oh no. Anyway.
Marvels The Defenders,What? They might put them on Hulu or Disney+ but we don't have Disney+ and Hulu in my country! This is sad.
Marvels The Defenders,Are they sending it to Disney Plus so they can continue it and wreck daredevil/punisher and whatnot? Cause that’d be dope.
Marvels The Defenders,This is going to make it weird for new watchers of DD as it happens between seasons 2 & 3 of DD. Season 3 is confusing for a few episodes if you don't watch Defenders
Marvels The Defenders,I left Netflix long ago.
Marvels The Defenders,"This post reminded me it was there. I watched it once while farming for shit in Dark Souls 3, no interest to go back. Daredevil was great, The Punisher was great, anytime Iron Fist got involved, not great at all."
Marvels The Defenders,"I didn't think Disney ever got the rights back to the pre-produced content. For the first time, a real continuation to Daredevil feels possible."
Marvels The Defenders,"Disney probably boughts back the rights to these shows on Netflix. And it is totally reasonable why this happened. The shows are not very valuable anymore for Netflix and yet, they might become very valuable indeed for Disney. And here’s why I think sp;

Disney is thinking of relaunching ‘The Defenders’ series on D+ since this will allow them to create Marvel content which is far cheaper than the MCU shows (each episode costs more than $20m which is not sustainable). The new shows might come around $3-5m per episode."
Marvels The Defenders,This was such a bad series but interesting precedent
Marvels The Defenders,"you know, the entire DC and MARVEL concept of reality should leave netflix that day."
Marvels The Defenders,Anyone else not even want Disney to revive these shows? Daredevil was so good and I’m afraid that Disney is just gonna make them super watered down and uninteresting like the other marvel shows
Marvels The Defenders,Why do they even do that ? Remove shows ? It can’t be because of storage shortage.
Marvels The Defenders,"Please put them up on Disney+. Call them ""Marvel Legacies"" or whatever I don't care. Don't take them away for good."
Marvels The Defenders,Who watched it? All were boring as hell.
Marvels The Defenders,?  This is a Netflix show and productions for characters they had a license for.  Strongly suggests these shows will become MCU cannon and these characters will soon show up.  NICE!
Marvels The Defenders,"Bye bye, you won't be missed."
Marvels The Defenders,I dunno why they would move them to Hulu instead of Disney+.  There are plenty of bad stuff in the marvel films and those all are still airing on disney+.
Marvels The Defenders,"While Daredevil and Punisher leaving Netflix and coming to Disney+ would mean more seasons for both shows, these shows are popular for their gritty and violent tone, which wouldn't fit the paradigm of Marvel shows hosted on Disney+ so far."
Marvels The Defenders,Oh noooo! /S
Marvels The Defenders,Wasnt that good tbh
Marvels The Defenders,Can it also leave existence?
Marvels The Defenders,"How? I thought it was a ""Netflix Original,"" that is, ""We paid for this. It's never going anywhere.""

So, does that mean anything on the platform is up for grabs? How is that right? What's the point of calling it a ""Netflix Original,"" when it's not really their stuff but simply another rental?"
Marvels The Defenders,Good riddance. Toss that into the garbage with Luke Cage and the awful Iron Fist
Marvels The Defenders,It was a really really bad show.  Jessica Jones and Daredevil were great.
Marvels The Defenders,Nobody cares.
Marvels The Defenders,Good riddance
Marvels The Defenders,"Is this worth watching? Not being snarky, but I assumed it’d be CW quality crap"
Marvels The Defenders,That show sucked so bad anyway. I couldn’t handle another scene of when the good guys are talking In a circle while the camera spins around them. And then they did the same thing with all the bad guys uuugghhhhh
Marvels The Defenders,"Good, it was a terrible show

I can see the ones who don’t know much about the characters outside of these shows found my comment."
Marvels The Defenders,[deleted]
Marvels The Defenders,Nothin of importance was lost
Norsemen,"That's what happens when your third season plot takes place before the first and second season.

Edit: So this is apparently my most popular comment ever. I for one loved every episode of this show but I felt what killed it was their plan to make season 3 a prequel to bring back one of their best characters. Sad panda."
Norsemen,Who dares to cancel their chieftain?!
Norsemen,">The series hailed from Norway and is the third project Netflix and NRK have worked on. Lilyhammer was the first (which still holds the accolade of being the first Netflix Original) 

...Is something supposed to retroactively take that accolade away?"
Norsemen,We'll see what happens.  Nine out of 10 concerns are completely unfounded you know.
Norsemen,This definitely does not make my assicle wag
Norsemen,"Surprised NRK canceled it. I could see Netflix dropping it, but Seasons 1 and 2 were ratings smash hits for NRK, like best of the year, and it cost very little to produce."
Norsemen,Noooooooooo
Norsemen,Feeling worse than Arvid at the end of season 2 right now..
Norsemen,"The sea giveth and the taketh.... this time the tooketh my sword... Orm at his best!

Too bad it is canceled!"
Norsemen,What in HhhHhhELHEIM!..
Norsemen,"This blows!! I just discovered this show on Netflix about a month ago & I binged watched it twice now! This show is brilliant all around, sooo funny. I put it on totally oblivious to it, thought it was another Vikings. Turned it on & really wasn’t paying attention to it, got sidetracked reading the news. 15 minutes in my friend in the next room asks “what are you watching”? I said “some Vikings rip off” & she’s laughing saying “are you listening to them talk”? I started paying attention & shite, outstanding writing."
Norsemen,"Wow, this news can suck a fart out of my ass"
Norsemen,"2020 just keeps on. I really liked norsemen, one of the better shows on netflix."
Norsemen,"If anyone wants me, I'll be on the shitting log. 😥"
Norsemen,"I absolutely love this show and am devastated.  I’d like to say it has a Monty Python vibe sense of humor though, so if you’re not a Python fan this might not appeal to you (I LOVE MP!).  

I DO wish season three hadn’t been a retro but then they killed off some good characters so I understand why they did it, but they shouldn’t have killed them (her!) off in the first place!"
Norsemen,This show is funny as fuck. Bummer.
Norsemen,booooooooooo
Norsemen,Noooooooo
Norsemen,"I’m glad they got three seasons, I grew up in canada on kids in the hall and sctv. Norse humor is something else, not for everyone. Sad it’s gone, because it was different."
Norsemen,"it ended when they kill forya, froya... whatever her name was, at that moment i stop watching it. Season 3 started as a prequel.... probably because they realize that kill her was a mistake."
Norsemen,"Cancel funny shows, let shit shows ride. The netflix way"
Norsemen,"Some people told me it was good. So I tried episode one three times. It wasn't for me. And I'm sure it wasn't for a lot of people either. Hit or miss, but I kinda feel bad for the people that did enjoy it."
Norsemen,Oh god damn you bastards I wanted to see those two weasels get blood eagle'd
Norsemen,"Bummer. One of the cutest, most deadpan, funniest, most absurd, lovable little series needs to conquer the West! This is not good for Orm."
Norsemen,"It was an extremely dark comedy and I loved it. 

Season 3 put me off a bit when I started but by the end, I was glad I got to know where the characters came from. I'm sure Netflix will bring it back for a farewell season as they do with unique shows."
Norsemen,"That timeline stunt killed it. Sad, yes. But the decision makes should have seen that coming from a mile away. I thought it was a pretty dumb move, instand bummer."
Norsemen,This is why I never start these kind of goofy shows. They always cancel them. Like Santa Clarira Diet.
Norsemen,"They took a really different approach in season  
3 , its tough to retain viewers like that. Also i hardly know anyone watched this show. season 1 was best."
Norsemen,Whats-not-on-netflix.com   Am I right
Norsemen,I'm reading this from the shitting log.
Norsemen,"Dammit Netflix, why do I still love you? It's like I have a that syndrome we don't have a name for yet."
Norsemen,"Can’t say I’m surprised. As much as I like the show, it’s incredibly niche in both its premise and its humor."
Norsemen,Why ?
Norsemen,This show is so damn good. Truly disappointing
Norsemen,Noooooo!  This show was so great.
Norsemen,"NOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!
WHY!!!!!!!!"
Norsemen,Nooooooo
Norsemen,Nooo!  This show was like The Office with Vikings.  The cringe factor was epic.  This makes me sad.
Norsemen,#saveNorsemen ... #assicle
Norsemen,They quit before it got shitty. Can only sotfball so many viking jokes.
Norsemen,Most people don’t realize it’s based on a true runestick.
Norsemen,Fuck 2020. I loved this show. It was brillant.
Norsemen,"Enjoyed S1 and S2, didn't get past the first episode of S3."
Norsemen,3 seasons on Netflix is like a show running for 20 years somewhere else
Norsemen,Damn. Great show but I don’t think prequel season 3 helped. Should have done that as the final planned season.
Norsemen,Noooooooooooooooooooooooooo
Norsemen,"Does anyone remember that show from Norway where the Russians do.... I guess a soft invasion because Norway decides to stop producing oil for environmental reasons? Anyway, It only ran for a couple of seasons on Netflix. It was a really good show"
Norsemen,"Gutting, one of the best comedy shows I've watched in recent years."
Norsemen,"Bummer, funny show"
Norsemen,Yeah not surprised since 3rd season was a bummer. Should have just continued the story of season 2 instead of giving us a prequel.
Norsemen,This is such a great show. I’m sad. Even worse was I couldn’t watch it in Norwegian on Netflix.
Norsemen,Noooo! I love this show 😭
Norsemen,I didn’t know it existed. Now I am torn.
Norsemen,Just started this show a few days ago and I really liked it
Norsemen,"Aw man, this sucks. I had such a great time watching this show with my friend a few years back and haven't seen season 3 yet cause I said I wouldn't go on without him. I've been psyched to see him again and tell him season 3's out but now I've got to tell him it's cancelled :(

I'm genuinely sad we won't get to see Orm continuing down the path of being a complete piece of shit or Jarl Varg finally getting his comeuppance. There was some legitimately great comedic and even sometimes great dramatic acting on this show and I'm really gonna miss it's unique tone."
Norsemen,"So sad, I’ve really enjoyed it!"
Norsemen,That’s terrible news
Norsemen,"They are cancelling every single show I like, fuck me in particular I guess."
Norsemen,"Fuck you, Netflix. You ruined and killed a *fantastic* show."
Norsemen,Norsemen will = Firefly. Sad news.
Norsemen,norSEMEN
Norsemen,First season was great. Then it felt forced.
Norsemen,Oh man. Fucking netflix.
Norsemen,Damn.
Norsemen,FFFF!!!!!!!
Norsemen,Noooooooooo
Norsemen,The actor they replaced him with would have totally killed it if they could have had season 1 but because they had to switch you know it is what it is he didn't do a bad job.
Norsemen,Nooooooooo!!!!!!!
Norsemen,"This series is great, I loved it. Sad that it won’t continue"
Norsemen,Boooo””
Norsemen,Noooo
Norsemen,😔😔😔 damn. S1+2 was funny as h...
Norsemen,What?! I love that show
Norsemen,I only made it halfway through season 2. Got too political and not enough wacky
Norsemen,Booooooo
Norsemen,Good damnit I love that show.
Norsemen,What the Helheim?! That sucks
Norsemen,Noooooooooo I love this show :(
Norsemen,I really enjoyed norsemen in the way that I didn’t know season 3 was out. Good show but I forget about it.
Norsemen,This is a bummer. Norseman balanced dark humor and drama very well. Should not have offed one of the main characters.
Norsemen,"Nooooooooooo I loved this show - it was so funny. 

ARVID!!! 

But yeah that badass warrior chick (can’t remember her name) was one of my favorites"
Norsemen,The Last Kingdom is season 4. It got very serious.
Norsemen,"I hate this, they left us with a big cliffhanger...... and it was really funny."
Norsemen,I JUST started watching it and I LOVE it. Please don’t do this!!!
Norsemen,Lame.
Norsemen,Aw man! Too bad! This show was a hoot! Better music and scenic shots than Last Kingdom. Which is a bummer cuz Last Kingdom is based on some amazing books.
Norsemen,This is such a shame. Love this show!
Norsemen,"> Lilyhammer was the first (which still holds the accolade of being the first Netflix Original)

Still?  That's sounds like someone doesn't know how ""first"" works."
Norsemen,"Question for fans of the show.

Now that it's cancelled, is it worth starting to watch it at all?"
Norsemen,Wow netflix is about to get a blood eagle. Only reason I still have it TBH
Norsemen,Well I guess I won’t start watching this now :/
Norsemen,"Why ? This show is f-ing hilarious , I've seen it twice since I discovered it this summer !"
Norsemen,"Nordic, Scandinavian shows are the absolute best!! Even as a comedy this show was good, funny as shit! Give Nordic crime series a watch, best stuff out there period! BTW I’m not Scandinavian whatsoever!"
Norsemen,I hate everything now.
Norsemen,Maaaaan one of the few shows I've rewatched multiple times
Norsemen,"No surprise there, the third season was hundebæsj."
Norsemen,What’s this about semen?
Norsemen,boooooooooo
Norsemen,Sad
Norsemen,Really enjoying this series. Too bad.
White Gold,It was so good
White Gold,"It'll probably take an episode or two for you to get used to the accents and slang if you haven't watched a British show before. That's to be expected though.

As far as content, I personally loved it. It's less of a comedy than The Office, New Girl, etc.. More like heightened reality. Definitely has a lot of similarities to the Wolf of Wall Street. 

I would recommend it. Maybe if people keep streaming it, we will someday get a Season 3 (one can hope)."
White Gold,Yes
White Gold,I don't believe this is a particular popular British sitcom. But I did quite enjoy it.
White Gold,"Yes, it's pretty good, better than most netflix originals. 8/10"
White Gold,It's not really like Wolf of Wall St but it's good
White Gold,"Definitely. It's brilliant (in a shit British kind of way). Despite being set in the 80's, it feels like a sequeal to the inbetweeners.

One thing I definitely noticed is the music. Pretty much every song is a banger.

As for no season 3, it makes no sense. I wish I understood the logic as it seems always the good stuff gets cancelled."
White Gold,"If you liked inbetweeners, give it a go"
White Gold,Alright boyses! 
White Gold,"Awesome - this show is hilarious and has surprisingly well written, in depth characters."
White Gold,"Interesting, Ed Westwick is still on the show?"
White Gold,"Love a bit of retro TV, I am hoping for Ford Capris and ZX Spectrums"
White Gold,Hopefully this gets its way onto Netflix in Australia like season 1 did. I thoroughly enjoyed season 1.
White Gold,What's with these shows taking 2 years off then coming back?
White Gold,Excellent! Hopefully that means it'll find its way to Netflix US eventually. I enjoyed s1 as a watch-while-doing-laundry show that I didn't have to think about too hard. 
White Gold,Any advice for watching this if in the US? Netflix only has season 1 and I don't have the money to buy a VPN
White Gold,Cool. Loved the first season. It should be on Netflix sometime then
White Gold,This is a seriously cringey show. Like take the 14-year-old humor of the Kingsmen films and amp it up by forty. 
White Gold,"Yes, production was shut down for a year (I believe) when it was announced charges weren’t being pressed they finished the show. 

But he doesn’t seem to be doing any press that I can see."
White Gold,Same here in the US!
White Gold,"In this case the lead actor was accused of rape and sexual assault, the BBC shut down production of S2 when it was announced he wasn’t being charged they finished production of S2"
White Gold,Hoping you saw that it's on the US Netflix now friend.
White Gold,Yes and I watched it recently. Liked s1 better but not bad. I do hope they continue it but I like how they had s2 end in such a way that I'd be okay if they ended it
White Gold,"Good for him if he's innocent, I guess. I feel like since his character on the show is such a perverted egomaniac that this could make viewing feel quite awkward. "
White Gold,"This show is one of the funniest comedies on TV right now. Plus, the production value and cinematography is fantastic - they really nail that British working class 80s aesthetic."
White Gold,I watched the first episode of this some time ago but it didn't really grab me. Should I try again?
White Gold,"Good to hear, I assumed that this show was done for since it's been so long. "
White Gold,I always think this is about that Got Milk ad campaign back in the early 2010s
White Gold,"Does anyone know how this show affords the music they use?  

Season one had what should have cost a million dollars per episode in music licenses — and they wasted huge expensive titles that would cost tens of not hundreds of thousands for throw away moments like transitioning from scene to scene. 

I feel like they were able to use this music in the uk cheaply because of bbc blanket deals but it should have been removed for US distribution (like Peaky Blinders had to do) but it wasn’t for some reason. "
White Gold,Ed Westwick should sue those 3 women for damages. This is effing bullshit
White Gold,"Yeah! Maybe the humour's not for you but I think you should give it a couple of episodes to make up your mind. Even if you don't like the humour, I'd say the production quality and characters would make up for it."
White Gold,"I was the same, when I started watching it was a bit *meh*.

I stuck with it, it's pretty decent, I'm not going to say it blew me away or anything but it definitely turned out better than I initially thought.

I don't think it's up there with the levels of stuff like Inbetweeners though, it's different, certainly worth a watch but give it an episode to grow and if it's not done in any episode and a half then it's probably not for you."
White Gold,It's BBC they just pay a set each year and can use anything they want. Internationally they re license what they can or use something else.
White Gold,"Peaky Blinders was TWC in the US, while this is BBC Studios which is the biggest TV distributor in the world after Warner Bros. and can probably negotiate better deals. "
White Gold,That was my exact same thought watch the first series as well... how the hell can they afford this soundtrack. 
White Gold,[deleted]
White Gold,"Right but like I said in my initial post they left in a ton (all of?) of music for the Netflix US version that I cannot imagine they could afford- Duran Duran, Inxs, the Cure, Elvis Costello, culture club, so much more (speaking as someone who works in the tv audio industry and knowing for a fact what many of these songs cost). 

Just wondering if there was ever any reviews or interviews that SPECIFICALLY indicated that they worked out a way to keep these tracks for the us version. "
White Gold,"I actually work with Warner Bros studios so I’ve seen the prices quoted to WB properties for some of these songs — so I assume BBC would get the same rates for US or worldwide use— and I did a back of the envelope breakdown for one episode music list and the costs for one episode worth of music would be more than the show cost to produce. 

And again $30k++ upfront titles were used as bumper music for 3-4 seconds. 

I can’t imagine anyone being willing to spend this on a small British comedy that I’ve never met any other person who has heard of let alone seen it.  

So I just wondered if anyone had ever seen any actual comments from folks involved in the show on how the music made it into the us version. I’m seriously wondering if it’s an oversight. "
White Gold,"People don’t understand how small the percentage of false rape claims is. The likelihood of them lying is extremely low, yet so many people jump straight for that. It’s gross. "
White Gold,"It's not small-time. The creator was the co-creator of Inbetweeners. The two feature film spinoffs of that show became the all-time highest grossing UK-Owned films in worldwide box office. Two of the stars of that show transferred across too, and Ed Westwick isn't exactly obscure. 

Then the X factor is worldwide rights being snapped up by Netflix, and even with the licensing costs it would still be one of the cheapest shows they have. "
White Gold,Very funny show.
White Gold,"BBC show, not Netflix show."
White Gold,Thank you! I haven't met anyone else who's seen it and I thought it was hilarious!
White Gold,Brilliant show. Though it has absolutely made me dread getting double glazing.
White Gold,"Watched it through a couple times now, I really enjoy it. Any word on if a season 3 will go a head?

&#x200B;

It is also a show that no one else seems to have ever heard of or watched. Another british comedy gem (a few years old now) that apparently only I watched and like was, ""How Not To LiVe Your Life."" Season two onwards is much better, but I often wonder why I find these shows and no one else I know ever does."
White Gold,I remember loving this show but then reading about the future being uncertain because one of the main actors was METOO'd but not sure anything came of it.
White Gold,"Just make sure the geezer selling it is hungover, stinks of cigs and is talking absolute nonsense 😂"
White Gold,"pretty fucking bad. terrible finale, terrible season. at least the 1st was decent but the 2nd just didn't have much going for it.

i also pretty much hate the main character. he's an obnoxiously unenjoyable prick who somehow always wins. honestly fuck that guy."
White Gold,"I just got done watching s2. I had no idea that it had already come out, I've seen no promotion or posts on reddit about it, the last I heard about this show they just resumed shooting and I believe that was earlier this year so I didn't expect this to be out already. 

I didn't like that Sam went down to such a level to destroy Pat's conservatory like that and I also can't wait for Sam and Vince's marriage to end because god damn is he a shit stain. 

Hopefully we do get a 3rd season, I'm looking forward to seeing Jo's revenge and Ronnie hunting Vince. 

Highlights of s2 was:

* It's fucking double U Windows!

* Ronnie Jr. He is quite the character and he's even funnier because I know a dude irl that has the same aura as him."
White Gold,"It was a crazy finale. Reading the episode preview gave me a little better idea of what they were thinking overall, but I guess because it was so rushed it kinda came out of left field as a twist ending.  


I get why Vincent kinda made the choice he did. If he took Jo along, he'd have to work and/or compete with her, and he doesn't really want anyone else on top. He knows his wife, as smart/capable as she is, clearly at this point isn't ruthless enough for sales. idk if he was playing Jo or if he was just being indecisive.   


Sam, OTOH, I'm not entirely sure why she ends up going with him other than it like seems like a kind of escapism? Like, I guess life with Lavender is a kind of doubling down on what they sort of have already and she isn't that happy with it. But she's right that Vincent is going to be the same guy in Spain -- and they're gonna have all the same problems -- so idk if she's really in the dark about his continued infidelity or if her destruction of property is a sign that she has her own impulsiveness to indulge

White Gold,Not sure how I felt about it but overall a very enjoyable TV show. I hope it continues. But confused as to how it will progress since the show is called white gold...window sales right? Not any kind of sales.
White Gold,I don't like how he is the narrator but is narrating things that his character was unaware of
White Gold,"I felt like the main character (Vincent, the one you hate) got a bit fucked in the end of series 1. I also feel the 1st one was way funnier."
White Gold,"Also ""It's not leaking, it's settling"""
White Gold,Bit late but he was 110% playing Jo
White Gold,I cannot wait for this. 
White Gold,Football friend. 
White Gold,How depressing that when I search for [Inbetweeners](http://i.imgur.com/l833CWG.jpg) this happens...
White Gold,"**Half The Inbetweeners boys reunited in White Gold first look**

FTFY"
White Gold,I wonder if the cocktease is gonna make an appearance too
White Gold,I wonder if there will be a way to watch it from the states?
White Gold,"Oohw, car fwend."
White Gold,"The sad thing is that I think an American remake could be really great, it just has to be on something like HBO or Netflix. The show just doesnt work without a hard R rating. "
White Gold,I'm not your fucking friend?! All right?
White Gold,"I'm not sure if Inbetweeners transfers well abroad, as a US version probably wouldn't work for us Brits.
"
White Gold,"Honestly, I always saw Inbetweeners as a TV and British version of Superbad."
White Gold,I think it could work well if framed around just how much more entitled and vulgar Americans can be in comparison. 
White Gold,"Watched the whole series today, wasn't as funny as I hoped but it was still entertaining.  I still see Jay and Simon because I've watched each episode of The Inbetweeners at least ten times but I still thought they were great in this"
White Gold,">they're playing only slightly more grownup versions of Simon & Jay

They are pretty much the same characters. It looks like the series is being written by the same person who wrote for Inbetweeners.

It does shed some light on why all of those old English houses have ugly plastic windows, though."
White Gold,"I've watched the first 3 and I'm really enjoying it, it seems like the offspring of the Inbetweeners and Wolf of Wall Street. "
White Gold,"I just finished it all. It's funny like the Inbetweeners but I wouldn't say as good, still worth a watch though!!"
White Gold,I just finished the first episode and I'm sold The Wolf inbeatwallstreet is fantastic.
White Gold,"I'm still wondering when if I'm actually going to laugh (I'm 3 episodes in now). I'd agree that Thomas' and Buckley's dialog is identical to that in Inbetweeners. 

I don't get why they can't take a chance with some of the humour given the low budget. It's so formulaic and lacks imagination. 

It's a shame because I had high hopes for this."
White Gold,holy crap its gets pretty dark. 
White Gold,inbetweeners is a hard act to follow
White Gold,Ooooo..... I love me some Inbetweeners but that trailer.  I sure hope the actual series pans out better than that.  Does not perticularly sound or look like a great premmis.  However James Buckley as a mustachioed sleazy salesman is worth a shot.
White Gold,They did shit on it with terrible movies.
White Gold,yes movies of comedy series don't seem to go well.look at dad's army complete rubbish
White Gold,I stumbled upon this recently and was surprised by the depth and hunmor. The main actor does a fantastic job
White Gold,"I love that BBC2 actually announced it with a static image with the 2 logo and the 1979 BBC2 ident into the programme (set in 1983)! To me, a nerd, that was awesome﻿"
White Gold,"It was never cancelled just on hold with the Ed Westwick allegations! Its actually made by BBC, the first episode of season 2 was on tonight but all episodes of season 2 are all avaialble rn on BBC iplayer, and on netflix a few months later in the uk

[https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episodes/p050hr6t](https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episodes/p050hr6t)"
White Gold,"I can't get the damn page to load with a vpn no matter which settings are used. They won't even load up, but everything else works fine. Might have to do a search to find a vpn that is a sure thing for the bbc player. As someone who spent a few years in high pressure smooth talking sales like this it's sooo funny. The money was good, but I got out because I didn't like selling mediocre products for way more than it's even worth."
White Gold,Is it similar to The Inbetweeners? Besides having some actors in common.
White Gold,"Its a different concept but the banter and chemistry between the two actors is still the same, cracks me up!"
White Gold,"Between White Gold and Loaded, they are borrowing a lot of elements from American TV. But the biggest problem is those two from Inbetweeners basically being the same characters."
White Gold,"Vikings and Ozark are not on the list because you did not enjoyed or because you never watched?

I love Game of Thrones,The Last Kingdom,The Handmaid's Tale and Westworld from your list.
Unpopular but i also enjoyed Cursed,It was fun to watch.
Season 4 of The Walking Dead was one of the best seasons in my opinion,If you disliked that season you would have hated some seasons in the future."
White Gold,Big Mouth is 10? That's seriously the worst show I've ever seen.  I always wondered who exactly watched that.
White Gold,How is Ted lasso not a 10
White Gold,Bob is awesome! Love that show!
White Gold,"If you subtracted 5 from each rating and went an ""* out of 5"" rating system instead, it still would be about the same."
White Gold,"Half of Game of Thrones (seasons 1-4) is a 10/10 show and the other half of it (seasons 5-8) is a 2/10 show.

So averaging them together, the show gets a 6/10."
White Gold,Breaking Bad but no Better Call Saul?
White Gold,Ewww Chrishell and Christine are both bad. Mary all the way.
White Gold,"Vikings and Ozark are on my list to watch! As for TWD I think I may have stopped after 3rd season? I don't remember as it was a while back but will definitely have to resume. I forgot to add to this list but the new show Invincible is really, really good and is made from the same people as TWD, highly recommend."
White Gold,exceptional in its 1st season and hits different but 10/10 is hard to hit for me and should be reserved for the absolute best that couldn't have been better
White Gold,😑
White Gold,"if he multiplied each rating by 13.8 and did a “* out of 138” rating sys, it would also be about the same"
White Gold,"It definitely got worse in the later seasons but for the most part it was still pretty epic, quality, or maybe I was just so invested at that point (sunk cost). Either way still an amazing show but I get where you're coming from"
White Gold,Simply haven't seen but I hear it's as good as if not better than BB
White Gold,Mary is indeed the most mature and apparently carries the load in terms of earnings for the O group. the favoritism seems to only be for drama as she has actually earned her place at the top.

20 Minutes,"I love how many comments here are doing the exact same thing as the fake outrage Tories, ignoring the fact that a presenter is being punished for having personal opinions and especially because he’s pointing out how transparently authoritarian and inhumane his government is, and just instead making pathetic attempts at ad hominem attacks."
20 Minutes,NYTimes just published an article about this situation if anyone is interested in further reading: https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/12/world/europe/gary-lineker-bbc.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare

20 Minutes,Gary lineker for PM! Wonder is he fancies a 1.1m pay cut?
20 Minutes,"As an American, it took me a bit of reading to make any sense of the bit of reading I was doing.

Edit: I actually don't live in a 'Murika hole at all. I just don't follow football often, and just haven't heard of a show that i may or may not even have access to watch. Not sure what's up everyone's ass here."
20 Minutes,"[Viewer number went up by 500k](https://i.ibb.co/qkpkLyG/Fr-A6mi1-X0-AMb8-GZ.jpg) lets see if it goes back to normal levels next week.

20 Minutes,"Isn't MotD without presenters just 'football'?...

edit: Guess I should've known better than dissing football. Last thing you want to do is aggravate football fans!"
20 Minutes,The guardian is jokes
20 Minutes,People need to calm down a bit.  Yeah the programme is better in its usual format but missing the often asinine commentary and punditry for one week is hardly a disaster.
20 Minutes,Something tells me this guy never watched football before anyway.
20 Minutes,[deleted]
20 Minutes,"Missed the commentary but tend to fwd the analysis.

Look like it had been produced by an intern.

Fact based"
20 Minutes,Racism is bad
20 Minutes,"So they pay this cretin £1.3 million a year and he's so popular that when his show airs without him on it, the ratings go up 23%. Come to think of it, it's ridiculous that a presenter whose show barely scrapes two million viewers gets over £1 million in the first place."
20 Minutes,[deleted]
20 Minutes,"It really doesn't need Lineker, people are just used to him after 20+ years. People probably thought it wouldn't be the same with Des Lynam when he left. But it definitely needs a presenter and pundits. And even more so, it needs commentators."
20 Minutes,I preferred it.
20 Minutes,"Lineker and co (Shearer, Wright and Jenas) are fucking terrible. They’re so biased as well, it’s sickening. I would rather watch MOTD without their incompetent analysis and biased views, ideally with better pundits in their place. Mark Chapman is much better than Lineker."
20 Minutes,"It was great. No pundits spouting bollocks, just the football."
20 Minutes,[removed]
20 Minutes,Lineker is awfully close to wanker.
20 Minutes,I don’t get the all the love for linneker. Literally any football fan could do what he does.

20 Minutes,Have you all forgotten the day the Cats trailer came out?
20 Minutes,Don't be revolting. It was only a blowy.
20 Minutes,Yeah exactly. You can watch the highlights for free on youtube shortly after full time. MOTD added a bit of personality. Without the presenters MOTD wouldn’t exist and it may as well be part of the sports segment of the 10 oclock news
20 Minutes,"I saw someone say ""it had all the goals"" like Match of the day doesn't always show all the goals. It's clear half of the people praising it have never watched it before."
20 Minutes,"Admittedly I haven’t lived in the UK in over a decade, but my memory of MOTD was that it was an institution because at the time it was basically the only way you could catch up on everything that happened in the PL because not every march was available to watch.

The idea that it’s preferable to render it down to a muted YouTube compilation is hilarious. Without the analysis and with the coverage for each match only lasting 3 minutes how do you enjoy it? How do you banter your mate about how shit his club was?"
20 Minutes,"> Amusing watching Conservative MP's acting like it was brilliant and preferable. 

⚽🍻⚽ How do you do, fellow plebs? ⚽🍻⚽"
20 Minutes,Don't vote Tory

20 Minutes,"Ignoring the fact that he wasn't even bound by the BBC's social media code of conduct, seeing as he was a freelance presenter and not BBC staff. Now, the BBC won't let him work for them unless he agrees to new terms - he has to agree not to speak against the government in public."
20 Minutes,"Same, but without the paywall - https://archive.is/Ye6ED"
20 Minutes,I’m about as interested in supporting the NYT as I am Match of the Day at the moment.
20 Minutes,"It’s a weird situation. what do people think/want impartiality to be? 

I’m really confused that most of the country seems to think that impartiality is something to throw away as long as the journalist in question says something they personally agree with."
20 Minutes,"That wasn't true, as confirmed by the WWF who partnered with the BBC on the episode. It was always intended to be an online-only piece separate from the rest of the show."
20 Minutes,"Completely untrue. The series was always 5 episodes, as announced last summer. The additional film was a companion piece made by a slightly different group of people, acquired specifically for IPlayer and never destined for BBC1."
20 Minutes,You do know he’s a cheater & serial adulterer…??

20 Minutes,I'll actually watch it now he ain't on it
20 Minutes,The guardian is instant karma. Which isn't to say they don't occasionally have a point but the way people take that and run with it is a bit much.
20 Minutes,How dare you. We must now pretend we liked the pundits and didn't think they came out with drivel and clichés.
20 Minutes,How dare you. We must now pretend we liked the pundits and didn't think they came out with drivel and clichés.
20 Minutes,"Look you can do the usual anti-sports spiel that’s so popular on Reddit but at the end of the day the husk of Match of the Day that was aired yesterday is a lynchpin to the slow but steady slide to the right the BBC are doing. The fact they haven’t backed down is a huge telling sign. 

But yeah. Sure. Footballs boring. That’s the lesson here."
20 Minutes,You can just watch the highlights of your teams game on YouTube 30mins after it finishes...
20 Minutes,I usually record it and fast forward the talking anyway
20 Minutes,"It's not ""idiots"". This situation is political in nature so this thread is about atacking the ""right"". Any response that doesn't attack the right will get downvoted by the PR agency hired for this hit piece. This has nothing to do with football or television."
20 Minutes,Ok Miss Universe
20 Minutes,"If MotD didn't have the pundits, analysis or interviews and was just highlight clips AND was uploaded online for me to watch at my own convenience I might too...

Oh wait."

20 Minutes,"2 million *live* viewers. A usual timeslot of 22:20-23:45 is never going to bring massive numbers weekly, but they can catch up on iPlayer."
20 Minutes,"Why do folk keep spouting this shite, you might not like the individuals involved but they absolutely offer insights into games. 

From the brief MOTD highlights (and the camera angles) it's often impossible to see what's happened in build up to a goal say, or how an individual has performed over the course of a full 90 mins - the extra analysis very obviously adds to your understanding of a game.

And these aren't random bland media idiots giving their insight, all 3 you've mentioned there were world class strikers, the absolute best at what they did. If you think you can watch 3 mins of highlights and know as much as these guys about what's happened you are beyond deluded."
20 Minutes,"Yeah and funnily enough people involved with sports in the UK tend to have a lot of respect for a former England captain, enough that when you force him out of the door at the last second they aren't exactly willing to work for you...

20 Minutes,Kinda like TNT if they just got rid of their inside the NBA crew. Everybody watches for their chemistry and commentary
20 Minutes,"I'd argue it's always been a relatively snappy highlights programme as well - the pundits tend not to talk for too long about each match (especially later into the show), so it works well to briefly break up the action for a bit, even if it's just to grab another beer or whatever between games."
20 Minutes,"Absolutely, its the pinnacle of many households Saturday night TV"
20 Minutes,"Dara O'Briain called out someone like that who called it the best ""Episode"" in ages. Who calls MOTD ""Episodes""?"
20 Minutes,[removed]
20 Minutes,Which ones?
20 Minutes,"This certainly contributed. From what I can tell, viewing figures are an average over the course of the entire programme, so it makes sense that more stayed around for 20 minutes in a middle/late evening slot than would stay for the whole ~90 minute slot that ends close to midnight. Especially as often the games at the end of the show are the shite ones with little action, so lots of people turn it off by then."
20 Minutes,"You know the BBC isn't funded by the taxpayer, right?"
20 Minutes,"Of course they were going to be higher. Everybody, myself included, were morbidly curious as to what a MOTD looked like without presenters or commentary. I thought it was terrible, and that seems to be the general consensus from friends and online."
20 Minutes,You quote the spectators gossips columnist? Urgh.
Murderous Affairs,Rosa Salazar? I'm in.
Murderous Affairs,"Anyone in Europe with the problem that the English audio track is way too low in volume on D+? Other languages and the audio descriptive track are fine with my usual volume setting, but English is almost inaudible. I would have to crank up the volume from my usual 50 to 90 or 100 to hear anything. Was the same with the trailer. Other stuff on D+ works fine."
Murderous Affairs,I love Rosa Salazar but that premise sounds… soapy.
Murderous Affairs,"Doesnt sound that bad, looking forward to watch like in a year when it comes to disney in my country..."
Murderous Affairs,It's already on Disney+ everywhere. It's a show made by Disney+ UK. They are putting it on Hulu in the US because they don't put mature content on Disney+ there.
Murderous Affairs,"thanks! admittedly i'm just annoyed I cant watch the latest season of the Orville, Reservation Dogs or The Bear yet"
Murderous Affairs,It depends on the region ig. All those shows are available in India already. The Bear became available quite late but it's finally available here.
Murderous Affairs,The rights situation is frustrating yeah...
Murderous Affairs,Quarry should have been more entertaining than it was.
Murderous Affairs,"Yeah I loved the idea, and the people involved and their previous projects, but for some reason Quarry just didn't stick with me. Watched it all but hardly remember it."
Murderous Affairs,"The number of people ITT who are upset *their* favorite show wasn’t on someone else’s entirely subjective list is a perfect microcosm of why /r/television and /r/movies kinda suck. You don’t need to be offended this guy liked other shows more. *Your* favorite is still *your* favorite.

OP took the time to write some pretty decent reviews for the shows, and even brought a few to my attention I hadn’t heard of that sound great. The Newsreader in particular.  There is no need to downvote this post"
Murderous Affairs,"I thought I watched a lot of tv this year but I didn't see even one of these shows. Most I have not even heard of.

Best show of the year? Dopesick, Succession, Mare of Easttown."
Murderous Affairs,"I'm always impressed by how varied your TV watching seems to be. I don't know how you have the time or the ability (access wise) to watch so many shows, especially international ones, but that's cool. Some of these sound really cool."
Murderous Affairs,"surprised heike monogatari is only 13. feels like it should be much higher with the amazing work they did on humanizing the various characters. Especially the struggles and decisions made by tokuko and the motivations behind them.

the production also did a fantastic job accurately depicting the historical setting. the beautiful and ugly. the luxury of the elite and the devastation endured by regular people. The social obligations and expectations everyone has to navigate and deal with. especially women.

the show is also not just aesthetically japanese or historically japanese but extremely culturally japanese. Especially the ending.

---

i really liked wonder egg priority and it was the perfect show for me up until episode 7. the beautiful art and amazing animation and fun characters along with tackling the difficult topic of suicide was really nice and meaningful.

But then I felt like it dropped the ball and focused on things that were antithetical to the topic of suicide. a focus on sci-fi for the sake of sci-fi instead of the raw reality that modern life is fucked for a lot of people.

the intentionality changed and with it, i felt like it ruined the show. >!(people killing themselves from their own volition as opposed to due to the machinations of a spooky AI daughter ghost out for revenge)!<

will check out blindspotting tho! nice list"
Murderous Affairs,"I'm so grateful for this list! I don't exactly know why, but I really growed bored of most american series I was watching. They have very good production values but I guess this list brings a very needed and refreshing cultural perspective. Thank you very much for taking the time to create this list of reviews!"
Murderous Affairs,This is the most pretentious shit I’ve ever seen.
Murderous Affairs,"Made a decision to watch less American shows this year.

Loved the Newsreader, Thunder in my heart and Threesome.

I wish Succession was on the list thou"
Murderous Affairs,"I’ve watched four from this list: Cruel Summer, Blindspotting, Squid Game, and Invincible. I liked three of the four. The other was OK. 

I’ve got Reservation Dogs, Maid, The Serpent, Anna, and Wonder Egg Priority on my watchlist already and have heard good things about all of them. 

I’m intrigued enough by the descriptions to add The Newsreader, Eden, Delete Me, and Sonny Boy to my watchlist. Hopefully they pop up,in my region at some point as I think of the bunch only Sonny Boy is available to me right now."
Murderous Affairs,"Not only did you put *Wonder Egg Priority* above *Odd Taxi*, you also put it at number 4 and the highest ranked anime. Furthermore, *Ousama-ranking* is missing as well (and presumably below *Wonder Egg Priority* according to this list). I can't comment on most of the other shows, because I haven't seen them, but the anime ranked on this is extremely sus. Of course everyone can have their own opinions, but with *Wonder Egg Priority* having such an awful ending even ignoring ep 13 (imo), I cannot see how it deserves to be above literally every other anime this year, let alone 4th among *all* shows this year. Among anime, also strange is *Horimiya* that high. It's actually one of my favorite manga because it's a nice wholesome read, but it quickly devolves into being quite generic after the strong start. I cannot see how it belongs at 19, let alone above *Odd Taxi*.

Also I admit I'm a fanboy of the show, but *Arcane* missing from the list is extremely suspect. It is the most nominated show at the Annies for a reason, getting a nomination count equal to Disney productions even though it was almost completely unknown (outside the LoL fanbase) before its release. Even if the story and characters are deemed just par, the technical component of the show alone should push it to a spot in a top 25 show of the year list. Also suspect is *Succession* missing, but you did mention elsewhere that you have yet to see it.

I appreciate the well written out thoughts on your top 25, I just think it's a really bizarre ranking. I will try to check out some of the shows you listed, some of them sound really interesting, so thanks for that."
Murderous Affairs,"Invincible only at 24?

No Arcane nor Ousama Ranking?

Attack on Titan S4P1 and Succession S3 also missed out."
Murderous Affairs,"I loved DP, Welcome to Utmark, and Anna"
Murderous Affairs,Thanks for putting all this work into your list. Makes it much easier for me!
Murderous Affairs,A best tv shows of 2021 lost really isn’t complete without Succession
Murderous Affairs,"Check out Yellowjackets, The Shrink Next Door, Scenes from a Marriage"
Murderous Affairs,That Arcane isn’t on this list is really sad - but each to their own!
Murderous Affairs,"What the hell. I heared none of these except maybe 2 titles. Also, where's Succession?

EDIT: Okay just realized entry number 3 is actually Squid Game."

What did you think of the list? Are there any shows you think that should be there that isn't (or vice-versa)? Any shows you think are ranked too high/too low?

**My overall thoughts on 2021 television**: Somehow I found more great shows this year than any other year... but none quite on the level of the top shows from 2020 or 2019 (*...does that make sense?*). There were a lot of bad endings, and quite a few shows on my list had inescapable downsides. But still I haven't seen everything I wanted to see this year as yet (Dopesick, My Name, Yellowjackets etc.), and maybe I'll update this list at the end of January if anything else stands out.

p.s. I'd like to give a shout out to @jramjee on twitter. Because of him I got access to a lot of inaccessible foreign TV shows. And also @L21sMa who took time out of his limited free time to do ~~some~~... in fact *a lot of* writing and editing for me. ❤️"
Murderous Affairs,Yellowjackets?
Murderous Affairs,I need to see Dopesick. Mare of Easttown was never going to be on this list. lol.
Murderous Affairs,"Okay firstly, sorry for the late reply to this. 

I had my issues with Heike. I don't think Heike laid out it's story (the genpai war) in a way that people not already familiar with it can fully understand. It's an anime for people already familiar with it (*which makes sense since the Japanese literally learn about the genpai wars in high school*). 

But don't misunderstand me now, even though I had my issues with it skipping pass (not animating) key moments the way it does, I still think it's a fantastic series and fully appreciate it. I mean... I watch over 60-70 new shows this year... so #13 is no small feat. 

> i really liked wonder egg priority and it was the perfect show for me up until episode 7. the beautiful art and amazing animation and fun characters along with tackling the difficult topic of suicide was really nice and meaningful.

> But then I felt like it dropped the ball and focused on things that were antithetical to the topic of suicide. a focus on sci-fi for the sake of sci-fi instead of the raw reality that modern life is fucked for a lot of people.

I agree... and disagree. I mean I don't want to go deep into Wonder Egg Priority post-episode 7 (which in true anime fashion introduced new ideas for the prospect of a big '*good vs evil*' final battle scene, that ultimately we didn't because of production issues), but as I said in another reply WEP accomplished what it needed to by said 7th episode... and it was incredibly impactful (*at least for me*), and nothing that came after (*as bad as it may or may not have been*) diminished that for me.

WEP was easily my #1 of 2021. And for all the reasons you meantion, ended up at #4 instead. But I'd also like to point out that I didn't just consider plot when making this list, so whatever shortcomings it may have developed in that department, to me it still had some of the best animation design, visuals, soundtrack and concept I've seen all of this year."
Murderous Affairs,Why?
Murderous Affairs,Stick to Vampire Diaries
Murderous Affairs,"😐 .... but... why? 

I'm actually curious since for some reason you got unvoted. 😅"
Murderous Affairs,Damn... I can't believe I found someone else besides me and Luis who watched Thunder in My Heart and Threesome. lol.
Murderous Affairs,-*raises glass and nods in approval*-
Murderous Affairs,"Okay, great reply! Answering this will be challenging but let's see if I can explain my decision making here. lol. 

First off, nothing is *suspect*, it's just my opinion, honestly. 

> Not only did you put Wonder Egg Priority above Odd Taxi, you also put it at number 4 and the highest ranked anime.

Wonder Egg Priority was actually my #1 show of 2021 before I watch that underproduced ending (*I actually saw it very late too, and read a few comments about the production issues they had*). But despite the unfortunate ending I didn't discard what came before. For me, it's still one of the most impactful and beautiful anime I've ever seen. And honestly, I feel like everything the anime needed to accomplished, it already did by the 7th episode. So it wasn't something that needed a great ending to be significant... it already was. The ending was really just to wrap-up the story. Some viewers put a lot of weight on ending, almost to the point where a great show is now a bad one if it doesn't have a satisfying one, but I don't.

> Among anime, also strange is Horimiya that high. It's actually one of my favorite manga because it's a nice wholesome read, but it quickly devolves into being quite generic after the strong start. I cannot see how it belongs at 19, let alone above Odd Taxi.

ODDTAXI is ranked below Horimiya because of visuals tbh. Plot-wise, Odd Taxi is far superior, but remember, I'm not just considering plot, I'm also considering production design, soundtrack, cinematography etc. (also why Wonder Egg Priority is ranked so high). 

> I will try to check out some of the shows you listed, some of them sound really interesting, so thanks for that.

Yea, you're welcome. Recommending shows is always my main reason for posting these listicles."
Murderous Affairs,"I loved Invincible so much that even though it wasn't the more unique or creative thing... and even though I was very underwhelmed by the art-style, it still made the list. 

As for Arcane, [well............](https://c.tenor.com/9pxLR-8u5z4AAAAC/homer-simpson-hiding.gif)

I haven't seen Ranking of Kings. 

And I'm the biggest Attack on Titan fan but as you can see I'm not very open to adding returning shows to my end of year lists."
Murderous Affairs,"Invincible was my nr 1 show this year. I had no expectations going in, I had not read the comics. And I was absolutely blown away."
Murderous Affairs,I haven't seen the new season yeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeet! 😩
Murderous Affairs,Ted Lasso anybody?
Murderous Affairs,I have no interest in checking out the U.S. remake of Scenes from a Marriage tbh. But Yellowjackets is already on my list of course. I'll see with The Shrink Next Door too.
Murderous Affairs,"> I heared none of these except maybe 2 titles.

That's suppose to be a good thing. Check them out. 

> Also, where's Succession?

I haven't seen the new season as yet."
Murderous Affairs,No wonder I haven't seen any of the shows you consider top of 2021. Obviously we have vastly different tv preference.
Murderous Affairs,"can not believe you got downvoted for not liking mare of red herrings. kate winslet must have had a sore back after carrying that piece of shit tv show. your list is very interesting btw, definitely gonna check some of these out"
Murderous Affairs,"ended up watching blindspotting and it was everything you described and more. really really great show and solid recommendation.

it felt like an upgrade on hamilton which was already pretty ground breaking.

very deserving of the #1 spot on your list and also now #1 on my list"
Murderous Affairs,"Have you seen ""Beforeigners""?"
Murderous Affairs,Nordic shows are great
Murderous Affairs,Uhhhhh... it doesn't have to be *that* vast. lol. I just found Mare of Easttown to be very unoriginal tbh. Great performances though.
Murderous Affairs,"I did [a review of Mare](https://www.reddit.com/r/television/comments/npc6zj/great_performances_and_characters_saves_mare_of/) basically saying the same thing. Kate carried that show, there was just... noting else to it besides the character work and acting."
Murderous Affairs,"Awww.. THANK YOU! 😄💕 

It makes me happy that you watch it and even happier than you enjoyed it. 

It seems like you actually *got it*. And that's nice to see because not everyone does. I remember me and this other TV critic friend of mine agreeing that it was easily one of the best shows we'd seen for the year (and we rarely agree on anything), but the reaction from imdb and a lot of the comments here didn't think so. It's creativity, and I guess the point of it all, really just flew over their heads. 

You're the 2nd person who've watched it from my recommendation and loved it, so thank you. hehe. 

But anyways, you seem to be an anime fan, so if you could recommend me a few anime similar to Heike or Anohana: The Flower We Saw That Day I'd appreciate it."
Murderous Affairs,"Uhh, no, not yet but plan to."
Murderous Affairs,"Hmm, animes similar to Heike are probably 

- Angolmois: Record of Mongol Invasion

- Vinland Saga

for the historical perspective. But they're much more ""anime"". Other stuff by Science Saru is also usually just ""good"" though. Like 

- Eizouken ni wa Te wo Dasu na!

---

honorable mention goes to 

- Mars Red

for being different and interesting. The CGI is pretty rough though but it's also based on a Japanese historical period. (Taisho era). And focuses around the corruption of the japanese military, and vampires. lol. It's based on a stage play that's sort of an adaptation on Salomé by Oscar Wilde."
Murderous Affairs,"Plot can be mundane, but realistic world building is top, you know, like Scandi series often do, like ""Akta Manniskor""."
Murderous Affairs,Thanks a lot. It's been so long since I asked I thought you forgot. 😅💕
Murderous Affairs,I havent seen Akta either but I know what you're talking about. lol.
Murderous Affairs,"I've seen only a few of the shows you've mentioned. The Promised Neverland, season 1 and Crash Landing on You were both great. Love + Death + Robots was okay. Perhaps because it was a bunch of disconnected stories, I haven't bother to finish it yet.

While I don't know if 2019 truly stands out from other years, I will add the following shows from that year:

* Swamp Thing
* Hanna
* Doom Patrol
* Carnival Row
* The Boys
* Pennyworth
* Beforeigners
* Evil
* Deadly Class"
Murderous Affairs,"I agree but for my favorites are a bit different than yours. I really liked the Mandalorian, Watchmen, His Dark Materials, The Imagineering Story, and The Boys. 2019 was also a pretty good year for movies too but that's a different topic lol"
Murderous Affairs,"Thank you, discovered Dead Pixels from this and will try it esp as I loved Mythic Quest"
Murderous Affairs,"This one was in my drafts for a while. I didn't even bother proofreading or anything so sorry for any bad grammar or misspellings.   
  
But you get the point, 2019 was an incredible year for TV shows, and to further add to that point, I didn't even add the 2nd seasons of **Dark**, **Succession**, and **Vida**; or the final seasons of **The Affair**, **Mr. Robot**, **Legion**, and **You're the Worst**, which all came out in 2019 and were all great. And of course there was **Dickinson** (*one of my favorites as you can tell*), **The Boys** and **Sex Education** as well. Fuck! It's like every TV writer and producer was on Adderall and molly that year, because the sheer amounts of creativity that came out of the television medium that year was just insane!   
  
p.s. I watched a French sci-fi romance series a while back, pretty sure it was 2019. It was about a man who found a time-travelling box in his basement/garage, and travelled back and forth from past to present trying to save the relationship he once had with the love of his life. I thought it was an interesting way to do a time travelling series, but I can't for the love of god remember the title. 😩"
Murderous Affairs,Holy shit. 100% forgot that Watchmen was 2019. lol.
Murderous Affairs,You're welcome. 😊
Murderous Affairs,Brand New Cherry Flavor was really good. I haven’t seen much like it. Nice to see it mentioned.
Murderous Affairs,BMF was absolutely horrible imo. I had hope for the show cause I have always had a lot of interest in the story but they dropped the ball big time. The acting is laughable and in certain scenes it doesn't even feel like they are trying to act. Huge disappointment for me. Sorry for the rant. Lol
Murderous Affairs,"Check out my [Top 25 TV Shows of 2021](https://www.reddit.com/r/television/comments/rp4ufb/top_25_tv_shows_of_2021/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3). Show some love. 

Along with this one I also have a '10 Worst TV Shows of 2021' list... but I'm not sure if I should bother writing it up. 😖"
Murderous Affairs,I don't know mane... Acting wise I thought Lil Meech and dollar store Omar were pretty good... 🤷
Murderous Affairs,Really?? We are gonna have to agree to disagree. I'm glad you enjoyed the show. Maybe I'm getting to judgmental in my old age. Lol

Murderous Affairs,Tbh I thought Jim Carrey's intro was going to be a little cringey but it was one of the funnier bits of the night. True and well played
Murderous Affairs,"we know who Mel blames

10/10"
Murderous Affairs,Rami Malek always looks a little like a heroin addict but I'm into it. 
Murderous Affairs,Tarantino acting yet again like he's sniffed multiple lines of coke. 
Murderous Affairs,That Ben Affleck burn caused Matt Damon to give an uncomfortable laugh haha
Murderous Affairs,Aziz gag with the book was hilarious.

Murderous Affairs,Don't worry guys the Oscars will still give the Best Actor award to Eddie Redmayne just to fuck with you.
Murderous Affairs,I really thought Kirsten Dunst would have won for Best Actress in a Miniseries. I honestly did not think Lady Gaga had a chance.
Murderous Affairs,"""WTF are these white girls talking about?"" - Queen Latifah"
Murderous Affairs,"Sam Esmail, whose career is just taking off, getting award recognition before Emmy. Maybe one day Emmy gets acknowledged for her great work in Shameless."
Murderous Affairs,Lmao at Leo laughing at her when she walked by.
Murderous Affairs,that chumbawumba joke was great and the audience didn't deserve it
Murderous Affairs,Lol gervais slaying the martian
Persona,I love Persona but it does not translate at all to Live Action IMO
Persona,"One way this can possibly be good is if it's a J-drama. A few anime/anime adjacent things work alright as dramas, but thinking about something like Catherine as an American production? Yeesh."
Persona,"Persona can work fine as an anime series, but I have a hard time seeing it work well in live-action. I guess it wouldn't be that different from the Japanese live-action JoJo adaptations though."
Persona,"Yoo, live action Jack Bros???"
Persona,Oh god no. No more anime/anime-inspired adaptions. They just don’t work unless it’s with a Japanese cast and even then those are hit or miss.
Persona,[deleted]
Persona,live action gonna be terrible.....
Persona,Amazing Tater movie?
Persona,I do not think think they even translated that well to anime. The player-character does not work well as a protagonist outside of a video game.
Persona,Catherine is the the one that could work most as a show if they’re doing live action.
Persona,"The one live-action adaptation I've seen with a Japanese cast was Fullmetal Alchemist, which ironically needed a western cast."
Persona,"Haven't most of the Japanese casted ones been good?  Death Note, GTO, JoJo's Bizarre Adventure, Wotakoi, Boys Over Flowers, and Kenshin all seemed to do well with live actions."
Persona,Live-action show adaptations of anime *do* work most of the time. The problem isn't doing live-action adaptations; it's that a lot of adaptations try to make them movies and therefore end up having to cut a whole lot or just rework the story in general to fit a movie runtime.
Persona,"There's no reason to assume these would be on Paramount+; Sega and Sony are separate companies, and Paramount just has the Sonic adaptation rights."
Persona,"How dare you, Yu Narukami was a goddamn riot in the P4 Golden anime."
Persona,P4tA made Yu the best character out of the entire gang.
Persona,He's also a fantastic character in the regular P4 anime. Makes me wish the protag had more of a personality in the actual games.
Persona,"Even though it's an RPG, I felt like Yu always had a somewhat uncanny personality despite the player-based choices in the game. At least at a much more noticeable degree than P3's protagonist."
Persona,"I think it helps that Yu was arguably given the most extensions for character development through two fighting games, a rhythm game, two dungeon crawlers, two anime, and Vita remake."
Persona,"The book this is adapted from was excellent, I've been excited for this show since they announced it. Hopeful they stay true at least to the spirit of the book, since wanting an exact story adaptation is probably a bit too much. Anyway, i cant wait to watch it."
Persona,I gave the book my best effort. I just couldn't get into it.
Persona,"This trailer seems almost breezy in tone compared to some of the dark & extreme places the book goes (though there definitely are hints). I expected something much heavier, but I wonder if that's just a misdirect to bring people in."
Persona,"Empowering people is good. Giving 100,000 of teenage girls superpowers that could be lethal and destructive seems...less good."
Persona,"I'm really hoping the trailer was just focus-grouped to death, and that's why it had this unserious, lightweight tone and framing. The novel is really far from that stylistically; it's award-winning fiction, not a teenage cash grab. Barack Obama put it on his book list. It's got more in common with *The Handmaid's Tale* than *The Hunger Games*. From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Power_%28Alderman_novel%29):

>The Power is a book within a book: a manuscript of an imagined history of the tumultuous era during which women across the world developed and shared the power to emit electricity from their hands. The manuscript is submitted by Neil Adam Armon to another author named Naomi, approximately five thousand years after the power emerges and revolution reassembles the world into a matriarchy. This historical fiction chronicles the experiences of Allie, Roxy, Margot, Jocelyn, and Tunde, as they navigate their rapidly changing world.

Most of those characters aren't YA, either."
Persona,I can't see this being more than a one season thing. Toni Collette is always great but these types of shows don't seem to do well on Amazon and this one was a mess bts.
Persona,Looks great! I can't wait
Persona,I’ll be honest I dont think I can sit through a movie where all of the main characters are teenage girls. I just know how annoying the dialogue is going to be.
Persona,Y The Last Man failed because if you give women all the power then you have to write some women as the villains and western audiences can't handle that. I don't see this doing any better.
Persona,">Hopeful they stay true at least to the spirit of the book, since wanting an exact story adaptation is probably a bit too much. 

That's surprising to hear. Granted I only watched half the trailer, I got serious 'YA' novel vibes before closing the tab and deciding this is probably for a younger demographic than me."
Persona,The book doesn't make it out to be a cool things across the board. Some pretty fucked up things happen as a result.
Persona,Less annoying than John Leguizamo bitching about shit because he thinks he’s a movie star.
Persona,"Game of Thrones is one of the most popular shows of all time and has numerous women villains. Y The Last Man failed because it was bad, not because western audiences can't handle female villains."
Persona,The novel is far from YA. Gets pretty heavy and dark.
Persona,"The novel is absolutely not YA, although there are a few very important characters that are literally young adults at the book's start. I was actually pretty dismayed by the apparent YA framing in the first half of the trailer, but the second half seemed to steer away from that into more serious drama trailer territory. Maybe front-loading it with that YA vibe was a marketing gimmick, but I really hope it doesn't reflect their adaptation in general, as that would really deviate from the book."
Persona,"> Less annoying than John Leguizamo bitching about shit because he thinks he’s a movie star.

I dunno. Other than ""The Menu's"" stand out and ridiculously good looking Anya Taylor-Joy, Leguizamo's movie star shtick was funny."
Persona,"90% of YA books are heavy and dark, they just tend to have a rather 'immature' perception to them. Hell, Harry potter starts off as a kids book and ends with wizard Hitler turning the wizarding world into Wizard nazi Germany, and then tries to murder an entire school of kids."
Persona,Except that’s his real life persona. It’s funny in the menu. Not when he’s bitching and moaning irl
Persona,"Not sure what YA books consist of these days, but this book was very much written for adults."
Persona,"I never thought much of Thomas Jane, maybe it was cause I only ever seemed to see him in bad or mediocre films, but he was incredibly good on The Expanse."
Persona,Normally I'm not a huge fan of Billy Bob Thornton but he is putting on an acting clinic in the first season of Fargo. Still my favorite character in that universe.
Persona,"I can't think of any TV shows but I'm usually not a fan of Charlie Sheen's acting, I don't know why. I was very pleasantly surprised by his role in Platoon playing a serious character with emotions."
Persona,"The Other Two is so damn good. 

The Sinner S1 showed me that Jessica Biel can act far more than I gave her credit for. In the forefront of my mind, all I can think of is her Blade: Trinity role and random scenes from forgotten episodes of 7th Heaven. So to watch The Sinner S1 and see her deliver a solid performance was a pleasant surprise."
Persona,"I know this is blasphemy… but I don’t usually enjoy Gary Oldman. While it’s clear to me that he’s very talented, I just don’t like watching him in most roles. 

*Slow Horses* is the first thing I’ve really enjoyed him in since *Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead*."
Persona,"Sorry I know this post is old, but. I didn't think much of Justin Theroux. I'd only seem him in Mulholland drive where his main job was to wear a cowboy hat with a small dash of being an asshole and a sprinkle of resembling a wooden ventriloquist dummy. All that I'm sure in service to David Lynch's vision but did nothing (imo) for theroux  but it was only like 10 minutes of screen time at any rate  Then many years later it seemed like he got real famous for dating Jennifer Aniston then had a pop culture presence for wearing $500 plain white t-shirts and having famous friends. I didn't really get it but it didn't really matter so whatever. But then I saw The Leftovers. Wow, so yeah I still don't know why anyone cared about him before but I thank him for The Leftovers. A+! I was so surprised."
Persona,He’s excellent as the coke dealer friend in Boogie Nights
Persona,Pre tiger blood phase.
Persona,"I know right? I hadn't even heard of The Other Two until recently but, now that I'm watching the show, I'm hooked!

Also Biel was great on Bojack Horseman."
Persona,"It's been a minute since I watched the finale but what do you mean he's pretending to be a doctor? I thought the point was he was inspired to take on the role for real after his experience delivering babies years before. 

As a disabled doctor, Jeevan basically becomes a living memorial to his brother and sister."
Persona,"Amazing mini-series, so moving"
Persona,"You probably made the link yourself OP, but if we're talking full circle - did you catch that the store Jeevan helps deliver all the kids at is *also* the town Kirsten comes to in Ep2, where her friend/ex drops out of the troupe to raise her baby?

Kirsten even tells us what becomes of Jeevan's maternity ward mentor."
Persona,"A wonderful, uplifting, joyous series. Very special."
Persona,"The near-miss earlier in that ep with the poster is the meanest show troll I've ever seen, lol

Something I genuinely only twigged afterwards also is that, while Kirsten will never really know the details, she winds up managing to pull off exactly the same thing Miranda did - she saves the people in the airport, and that's the parallel that's being drawn between them.

I have a theory about the spaceman's identity that I will blather to anybody who listens, too.

What a masterpiece this show was though. 
There seems to be a blu ray release sketched in for the 18th on Amazon and I'm grabbing it with both hands, I don't trust HBO Max not to do something weird with it now they're vaulting stuff."
Persona,"Absolutely fantastic show. It really scratched that itch after being completely heartbroken after completing The Leftovers. Hoping to see the cast in future entertainment -particularly Young Kirsten, Jeevan And Miranda"
Persona,"Great point. I also loved the idea that the graphic novel was responsible for splitting them up in the first place (essentially) - then in the future, that child steals it from Kirsten but she lets it go. Then she turns around and finds Jeevan."
Persona,Uuuggghhh. So pretentious!
Persona,"The world that was built up in the show is frankly (heh) insulting. We spend 20 years and the child terrorist ringleader destroys what little information they had from before the collapse and Jeevan is using 18th century remedies. At least in the book they indicate that there is civilization and electricity running in some cities... but christ, the show was awful, post-modernist schlock meant to make us sympathize with a goddamn terrorist"
Persona,"I've been watching ""Station Eleven"" on a recommendation from others and it feels...eh. Very slow and boring. Nearly all the scenes are people sitting around drinking wine and chatting. Hard to be motivated to keep watching after episode 3."
Persona,"Just in the sense that he isn’t licensed.  You can deliver all the babies in the world, that doesn’t mean he has training.  So it’s cool to see him take on this role for the community especially after the first time we see him he tries to save Arthur’s life even though he’s not actually trained in CPR"
Persona,A pleasant surprise for sure
Persona,So pretentious!
Persona,Omg no I didn’t. Wow that’s fun. Thanks!
Persona,"The characters are very happy. The literal definition of joyful. I’m not crazy, just literate."
Persona,"Deserved a lot more of an audience than I think it probably got thanks to the bizarre release pattern.

In the US it was dropped in chunks of the season here and there, either side of the New Year, with sod all promo. It was shunted off into a no name Amazon addon with almost literally nothing else on it over in the UK, and it's only been released in parts of Europe this month.

A HBO Max/Discovery mess casualty I think."
Persona,"how the actual fuck is a world without anti-biotics *joyful*? Are you fucking crazy?

They let a terrorist walk away. That's not uplifting! That's enraging!"
Persona,What’s your spaceman theory I wanna hear it
Persona,I cannot get my head around Deadwyler not getting nominated for something off her almost one-woman-episode. Insane.
Persona,"I get it, even if others didn't"
Persona,"As one of the characters notes, it won't be difficult to rebuild the museum now they're back in contact with the outside world. There are artefacts everywhere.

You're not meant to sympathise with him and he's crazy, not a terrorist.

There are multiple points of dialogue about how they have antibiotics. That's how Tyler survived the stabbing, it's what the kids went to get in the plastic bag, the older kid tells Kirsten to play along with pretending they're something space related."
Persona,I don't think Tyler told the kids to be terrorists. He says to Kirsten he lost control of them while he was incapacitated by the stabbing. One of the kids came up with the idea for suicide bombing.
Persona,"I see what you mean. It's true he's not formally trained as a doctor. But he still has informal training and years of experience as a healer. He's not faking it or acting impulsively like he did in the theater. I think you're right this sets up a nice symmetry, but it's one of mirror opposites. Jeevan is a very different person by the end."
Persona,"Nobody to issue licenses anymore in the post pan world, to be fair, and when he leaves the store in the babypocalypse episode it's sketched out pretty clearly that he's going to spend the intervening years doing the legwork and learning how to do this stuff right. He's what they've got for a doctor now."
Persona,[deleted]
Persona,My favourite line from the series.
Persona,"The show does some really cool stuff with cycles and loops that you only pick up on on rewatch, I really strongly recommend doing another full watch because there's a whole lot of stuff waiting for you to find the second time.

Re the town, it's called St Deborah by the Water. Terry the doctor eventually reveals her real name is Deborah. Go back and check out the statue of ""Saint Deborah"" that Lori Petty comments on as they're coming into town, who we're told died in a chemical fire (some folks have speculated it might have been arson committed by another character we already know too, but there's no way to know)

You can also see the wreck of the store's old delivery truck on the way into town, and the hippy dippy focus on child rearing and midwifery comes from its roots as an improvised delivery centre.

I won't spoil much else, but I will say Kirsten's slightly on-edge demeanour in ep 2 makes way more sense when you realise you see some of these locations twice - once under snow. Kirsten's ""What if a wolf ate the baby?!?"" line is just a gag about how clingy she is the first time through - but it sounds much more reasonable in when you know more about her history in the area.

(Ps keep a very close eye out for the name on the Birth Certificate Deborah writes up for the baby whose mom died in labour.)"
Persona,"Maybe partially those things mentioned, but it still could have become a sleeper hit regardless.

I found the show well made and acted, but honestly I didn't care for the comic book parallels nor did I like most characters except Jeevan and child Kirsten. I don't think it needs to be a different show, but it certainly is more niche than most in terms of gripping emotionally. Many good shows deserve to have a wider audience, but often it has to do with the product rather than the release schedule or promotion.

Another example would be FX's Legion."
Persona,"1 - They have antibiotics again. It's specifically mentioned.

2 - Tyler is a crank and he's not-not dangerous now, but he didn't order the attacks and attempting to ""punish"" him would have triggered a bloodbath."
Persona,"I think that's Kirsten herself under the visor, metaphorically.

In a live chat, Patrick Somerville mentioned that he tried to reserve K names/words to have something to do with Kirsten - so for example, the reason Jeevan's kid is called Key is after the key Kirsten didn't have on the night of the outbreak, which sent him on the road the rest of his life wound up taking.

In the S11 comic book, it's strongly implied that Doctor Eleven is actually the kid - called simply K - who once led the Undersea revolt, now an adult, somehow trapped in a time loop, where she now just helplessly witnesses the whole tragedy play out again. 

(This is Kirsten's theory to Tyler, and if you check out the comic pages it makes sense - K has a distinct skin tone, and the artwork highlights Eleven's bare feet to show us ""he"" has it too. Somerville has also said that Kirsten is likely right about her interpretations of the comic)

When the spaceman shows up in the show's real world, he's sometimes clearly highlighted in the shot and sometimes semi-hidden in the background, though he's always watching over the POV characters in a similar way to K/Eleven. 

But he shows up for some more than others; he shows up to watch over little Kirsten and Miranda, but never for Clarke or Jeevan. He doesn't show up for Tyler as far as we know, even though he's got a whole child cult built around Doctor Eleven's storyverse.

Episode 7 is one of the few Kirsten related episodes we don't see the space suit in - but Mackenzie-Davis-Kirsten is performing ""his"" role anyway, as a spectral, benevolent sidestage observer. She can't change anything anymore than Doctor Eleven could - she can't save Lonegan/Frank or affect the outcome at all. Her child self even plays the K role in the play she's contrived. All she *can* do is observe it from her new adult perspective and take stock of her child self more clearly.

Ultimately though, they have to go their separate ways, divided by the door of Frank's room in a shot that directly echos the comicbook image of Eleven, divided from K by a glass wall.

I think the spaceman essentially represents Kirsten's adult self hanging over the moments ""he"" shows up in, as if she's haunting her own past from the future. Almost all of the moments he appears in are ones Kirsten either directly experiences or ones that have a major influence on her indirectly- she winds up, in many ways, the keeper of Miranda's legacy, and emulates her in saving the airport. And the last and only time we see him alongside Adult Kirsten is when she is watching the Tyler/Clarke Hamlet play out; when she's finally coming into her own and stepping up to her place as an adult, as a director, and as the troupe's new leader. 

That last shot of him is also the only time we see the spaceman in the show's ""present day"" and I think, in a sense, that moment of him watching over Kirsten as she's watching over everyone else is basically the point they come back together."
Persona,And he was driven ‘crazy’ because he wanted to try and help people but the guy in charge said he was dangerous so they were gonna kick him and his mom out. Turns out the guy in charge was just a power hungry has been trying to feel important because he wasn’t in the life before. Everything that happens to Tyler in the show is Clark’s fault and he was just trying to get back at Clark by destroying the bullshit he built since he chose that over helping other people
Persona,"I downloaded episode 6 and yes, antibiotics were mentioned - that's my mistake, but it's apparent on viewing the scene again that Kristen doesn't know that this is still available, and what is made is probably not exactly pharmaceutical grade."
Persona,"Sure, and they dug up the mines by themselves?"
Persona,A healer? They don't have fucking antibiotics!
Persona,"Big potential for the show to faceplant though, given how delicate the magic of the book feels, and I mean they did make some BIG changes. The most iconic chapter of the book isn't even in it, and the main element people remember from the show was an addition. They pulled it off with real grace, but it was by no means guaranteed.

(I do have some grumbles about the Tyler stuff that said)"
Persona,"Personally, I found the show a lot more moving than the book.  Even the author has praised the show for making connections in the story that she did not."
Persona,Holy shit this blew my mind! Sorry just watched the show and dont see new threads lol. What was the name on the birth cert? I just finished it and not due for a rewatch just yet haha.
Persona,[deleted]
Persona,"Yea he’s dangerous he literally just bombed an airport and almost killed a guy on stage! Not only did they not punish him they let Alex (or whatever her name is) go with him 

I don’t recall them mentioning antibiotics. For the burns I recall a “healing paste” at most."
Persona,"I don't quite go with that reading tbh. Clark is flawed, but Tyler is definitely a weirdo from the get go, and even if he wasn't he does bear responsibility for what he is now.

What's more, Kirsten has been through far worse than Tyler, has grown up thinking she's probably responsible for getting Frank killed and maybe even Jeevan - if he hadn't abandoned her - has had to kill at least once by the time she was about ten, and was nursing a stab wound when she was found by Lori Petty (and there's also a strong possibility the Red Hats she's crossed paths with as a child and again as an adult were pedos)

Kirsten has grown into a fundamentally compassionate person with a kind of public vocation. Tyler had it easy by comparison and kidnaps kids from their families to a life of squalor just to play out his mommy and daddy issues.

Clark handled things badly, but Tyler's a grown ass adult and the fact he can switch off and on the Prophet persona whenever he wants tells me he has the wherewithal to at least tell right from wrong to some extent."
Persona,"Yes? I mean, it's fine you didn't like the show but it feels like you're fighting the narrative to justify your preference."
Persona,Would you mind spoiling a little detail from the most iconic chapter? You've made me mighty curious!
Persona,"I looooved the show and finally picked up the book a few weeks ago. I’m about 2/3rds in. Clark’s flight just got diverted to Severn City.

It’s amazing how much in the adaptation is different but still maintains the general spirit of the book. The show felt uneven to me, with the past episodes being much more engaging than the present episodes. So far that unevenness is completely absent from the book. And often the present chapters are grabbing me even more. 

I’m excited to see what happens with Tyler, because that definitely felt like it missed in the show. But so far I’d say the show’s version of the past is either as good or better than the book. The show’s adaptation of the present is pretty much across the board worse."
Persona,"I missed some of Kirsten's inner thoughts. There's a bit where Book Kirsten realizes she's about to die and can't save herself that I found very affecting, and the show seemed to find Tyler way more fucking interesting than I did."
Persona,"It's Alexandra. The baby is Alex. 

Alex's mother was Rose. When Alex sang a tribute to the woman Tyler talked about, she was unknowingly singing a tribute to her own mom."
Persona,"That's my point, yep.

First watch, ep2 plays out like Kirsten is being unreasonable and pulling a completely bizarre worst case scenario out of her ass just because she's desperate to keep Charlie close.

By the second time you watch it, you'll know exactly why she went there, and indeed it's clear she was actually being pretty rational about almost everything that initially read like an eccentricity in ep2."
Persona,">Not only did they not punish him they let Alex (or whatever her name is) go with him

Again, ""punishing"" him isn't an option. He and the kid cult are a moving disaster that gets averted. The alternative is having all those thousands of kids do who knows what. Last time the thing was a suicide bombing. 

Kirsten is well aware of how volatile the kids are, she knows they still have a huge stockpile of landmines, and she knows that they're on the way once the tower burns. Her options are to either pull a miracle out of her ass and keep everyone alive a little longer, just as Miranda did, or else try metaphorically stabbing Tyler again and trigger bedlam. She pulls off the first one and does what she can to decommission the kid ringleader Hayley.

That's life. They don't live in a fair world anymore than we do. The Alex thing sat uneasily with me, but what's the alternative? She's an adult.

>I don’t recall them mentioning antibiotics. 

Episode six."
Persona,"Oh yeah it doesn’t excuse all of what he does as an adult but everything he does after he leaves was to survive. Sure Kirsten handled her shit better as she was also trying to survive, but he was still a kid trying to navigate the world on his own too. Plus his parents were both famous actors so it’s not like he had a ‘normal’ upbringing to start with. Kirsten might not have had one either but at least she had Jeevan and Frank to help her through the beginning instead of Clark and Tyler’s mom. But the way Clark handled the situation at the airport, at least to me, explains Tyler’s motivations a little bit more and shows it’s more than him just being a crazy terrorist"
Persona,"Exactly.

They have insider knowledge on this one, too. The kids we see using the mines as suicide vests are actually *from* Pingtree. They knew the mines were there, and we're told the mines have been removed and re installed in recent memory, so they would have watched a bunch of them being defused and reactivated and maybe even shown how.

Incidentally, this is also probably the only reason Alex didn't get them all killed either time, because unbeknownst to her the mines were already gone."
Persona,"No, I'm angry at the fact that this show is being praised as being ""hopeful"" and ""uplifting"" while attempting to make an idiot kid who later became a child terrorist ringleader sympathetic! 

Do you think the kids dug up the mines from Pingtree themselves? Of course not. In the book he's a Christian fundementalist!"
Persona,"Sure, it's ""An Incomplete List"", I sometimes see it excerpted on its own as a kind of free verse poetry or else used for spoken word pieces.

It's a list of some of the basic everyday stuff that's gone after the wipeout. 

One big loss/difference between the book and the show, is that the book makes a much bigger point of having no easy answer to the question of ""preserving what's left"" vs ""letting it go to move on"", where the show is comparatively very much Team Let Go/Move On.

So there'a a lot less made in the show of the fact that Kirsten is one of the few who is the exact right age to remember life before clearly, but have had to grow up and be formed in the one after. Older troupe members will always see the post pan world as a kind of overlay over the ""real world"", while to the younger ones, the post pandemic world is the only one that's ever existed. 

Kirsten is one of the handful left with a foot in each camp, and really wrestles with it, and the fact nobody older or younger can quite relate. She believes that ""the more you remember, the more you've lost"", but still clearly treasures the memories she has of Arthur. She's adapted herself incredibly well to the post pan world and carries almost nothing she doesn't need, but still obsessively collects clippings from old gossip magazines about him. And so on.

Incomplete List crystallizes some of that, in a way that isn't quite in tune with the show. It's a list of all the stuff that would be lost in an event on that scale, but also kind of a love letter to how extraordinary it is to have this stuff now, and how sad it actually would be to see even our flawed kind of world end, even when it sprinkles in little details of people having fun after it.

You can read a chunk of it here - https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/6876800-an-incomplete-list-no-more-diving-into-pools-of-chlorinated"
Persona,Is the book chronologically sequential or have broken chronology like the show?
Persona,"Oh what.... the fuuuck wow.... holy shit dude, I forgot tyler was there and forgot him talking about Rose. So... he wasn't lying about his wife Rose? Is he's not Alex's dad? I mean he was like 13 at the time but the girl looked high school age possibly."
Atypical,One of those Netflix shows that actually feel like it has a heart. So far it was a solid 9/10.
Atypical,"This is one of my fave Netflix shows, and the strongest family drama I have seen in a very long time.  I honestly don’t get why it doesn’t get more buzz."
Atypical,As someone on the spectrum. This is easily the best representation of autism in a tv show I’ve ever seen. I relate so much to this character
Atypical,Well this is a nice surprise. Based on the last season I thought it was over. Especially being a Netflix show in it's third season.
Atypical,I'm mixed on Rappaport but he is really good in this.
Atypical,They nailed the brother-sister relationship so good loved the show
Atypical,Final season too if I'm not mistaken
Atypical,#cazzie
Atypical,"Hell yeah, Return of the Penguin king!"
Atypical,The story. The acting. The writing. The way they represent people on the spectrum. Just everything on this show is simply beautiful and amazing. It puts you in a  vulnerable spot and I love it.
Atypical,Yes! Absolute favorite show on Netflix
Atypical,Other than Elsa this show rocks
Atypical,Can’t wait!
Atypical,This is such a good show. The main cast seems to have great chemistry; really feels like a real family.
Atypical,"Always loved the music of this show for some reason, glad it's back for a final season."
Atypical,Love love love this show.   Cast is amazing.
Atypical,Nice! This is one Netflix’s best shows. It’s entertaining and always hits right in the feels.
Atypical,So glad Netflix let it finish its run. Great show. Loved it.
Atypical,Love the show. But can’t get past how the picture headlining the article is a screen grab where the faces have been photoshopped to look like porcelain. It’s freaking me out.
Atypical,Jennifer Jason Leigh's plastic surgery absolutely destroys this show. Why do actors feel the need to go that far? I have to imagine she'd have been a natural beauty as she aged. Now she looks like she has to take a shit 24\7.
Atypical,"Zahid is annoying, but Sam and Casey are amazing characters! I love this shows' writing. I'm so excited for the final season!"
Atypical,"Does anyone else hate the mom? 

I can’t get over her, especially when she’s trying to “bring the family together again” like fuck you, you are a betrayer. It’s gotten to the point where I hate the actress face. I recently saw The Women in the Window, although she didn’t have many scene, it was hard to see past her Atypical-character and see her as this new character in a different movie."
Atypical,Netflix giving a show a 4th season? That is very atypical of them.
Atypical,"Fuck yeh, this show is amazing."
Atypical,This used to be my favorite show about autism until I found Everything's Gonna Be Okay.  It helps EGBO that Kayla Cromer is only three years older than her autistic character.  Having a balding 29 year old guy play a 19 year old is a bit of a stretch.
Atypical,"Yay, I’ll have something to watch for a whole day."
Atypical,"Awesome, love the show!"
Atypical,Let's go!!!! Better be 13 episodes!
Atypical,Glad we get one more season. It's a great little show.
Atypical,"A Netflix show surviving more than 3 seasons!?

I guess that means this will definitely be it's last."
Atypical,Is this going to be the last season? I really love this show.
Atypical,A Netflix show that actually gets a 4th season?? I didn’t even know that was possible anymore.
Atypical,"I kinda hate this show, but I watch it?"
Atypical,Time to resubscribe
Atypical,"Awesome show, I always look forward to watching the next season"
Atypical,I have never heard or seen this show and apparently it already has 3 seasons lol
Atypical,Yay! more Tink from The Guild please!
Atypical,IMO the best Netflix original all 3 seasons have been solid. I hope Season 4 sticks the landing
Atypical,Wtf I thought this show got canceled? I'm glad to hear the news but what happened??
Atypical,Finally!!!! This is such great news.
Atypical,Why do good shows get canceled and bad shows get renewed?
Atypical,"I enjoyed this show for a while, but i stopped watching because i cannot stand Michael Rappaport"
Atypical,The sister is hot
Atypical,"It’s an ok show, but there have been much better Netflix shows that never made a 4th season ."
Atypical,Neat
Atypical,"look up kier gilchrist on instagram and get prepared for a surprise. hah he’s a very interesting dude. in a good way, by the way. hah"
Atypical,"Cool. For some reason, I thought it wasn't coming back. Glad to hear."
Atypical,OK but what about Sex Education?! 😫
Atypical,They released the cancelation date shortly after.
Atypical,Yayyyyyyyy
Atypical,"YESSSSSS!!!!!!!!! I truly feel represented watching this show, it’s great to see a character love penguins as much as I do"
Atypical,Question: why does Sia get get a bad name for using a non-autistic person in her film when this show does the same thing and no one seems to really be talking about it? Maybe I don’t have all the facts. Maybe someone could enlighten me.
Atypical,My favourite show! The acting is really well done! Great casting.!
Atypical,The acting by the parents is horrible. The mom and dad are both horrible. The kids are great. Tough issues done well.
Atypical,If you can look past the actor's true age to what they are trying to portray on screen (high school/college age) it's a genuine show that I wish could have been on network TV with 20 something episodes
Atypical,"It’s a good show, but it bugs me that the actor that plays Sam isn’t actually autistic. He does a good job in the role, but it should’ve been given to someone who’s ACTUALLY on the spectrum"
Atypical,[deleted]
Atypical,"Im convinced this sub is only used by networks/shows for free advertising, and we all eat it up."
Atypical,"Michael Rapaport makes this show an easy, and I mean easy, pass"
Atypical,what stupid ass show is this i care about stranger things not this garbage
Atypical,So glad that this wasn't cancelled
Atypical,So many shows coming back! I’m glad it’ll get a real ending
Atypical,Hey this show was alright!  Hope there is a third season of that German drug show
Atypical,YAYYYYYY
Atypical,Get *th*ome
Atypical,"Awesome, I finished the third season just a few weeks ago, thought that COVID would delay it longer, but glad we get another season soon, I was surprised at how much I enjoyed this, hearing mixed things, I thought it was going to be bad, not just for autistic people but as a show, and personally I found it to be a fairly postitive representation, with flaws that were ironed out in further seasons. Definitely watch it, even if you aren't on the spectrum yourself, you might learn a thing or two or just to watch a decent little show."
Atypical,Yes! One of the best shows I've watched in recent years.  I love the cast and family dynamic they have going. I also adore how inclusive it is!
Atypical,"Yes, it has a release date.

I'm also sad this is the final season.

<3"
Atypical,"Yesssss, I was worried it ended."
Atypical,Hold up. There’s already been season 2 and 3? I watched the first season when it came out.
Atypical,Might have to watch this with the wifey. Is it a comedy? Drama? Suspense?
Atypical,How is this show compared to *Everything's Going To Be OK*?
Atypical,Might have to check this out.  I didn't know that Jennifer Jason Leigh was in it.  She's always good.
Atypical,ADELIE EMPEROR CHINSTRAP GENTOO
Atypical,Guess who is getting Netflix again this July!
Atypical,Does Kevin Durant make an appearance?
Atypical,id prefer Keir doing his band stuff....
Atypical,Didn’t like how the sister left the bf the way she did. Poor guy deserved better.
Atypical,I’ve never even heard of this show
Atypical,Fuck yes!
Atypical,I love JJL!!! Been a fan since Dolores Claiborne!
Atypical,I JUST started re-watching this today! Hell yeah!!
Atypical,Yay! This is one of my favs!
Atypical,That's my birthday
Atypical,Yes! Let’s go!!!
Atypical,Great show. Watch it
Atypical,YES
Atypical,Such a great show
Atypical,Best show ever! Hate that this is the last season.
Atypical,Gimme more Rappaport
Atypical,Finally!
Atypical,Finally something good. Netflix release have been weak recently (for me personally). Kominsky Method final season was bittersweet but I finished it in 2 days.
Atypical,"Michael rapaport? Man I wish they still played that other show he was in… can’t remember what it was….

Edit: The war at home"
Atypical,#Can’t wait! 👏🏻
Atypical,SUCH a phenomenal show.
Atypical,"I just came to say....

I will genuinely miss Sam Gardner."
Atypical,"Like most shows it takes a little bit to find its rhythm, but once it does I just love it. It has so much heart. I really hate Elsa though. I don’t know if it’s how she’s written or if it’s Jennifer’s acting, but she’s so whiny and “oh poor me” that it drives me crazy"
Atypical,"I have my issues with it but it has been one of the better portrayals of being autistic I've seen and like you said, it's got a lot of heart.

I think a lot of that comes from that they listened to criticism about the lack of autistic writers/actors in the first season and hired more, as in the second season there are multiple moments that made me cry because they were so relatable to my own experiences as an autistic person in a way I'd never seen in the media before."
Atypical,Yeah. Father of an autistic son here. It was a great show
Atypical,I would honestly give it a 10/10. I freakin love that show
True and the Rainbow Kingdom,[deleted]
True and the Rainbow Kingdom,My daughter loves this show! Can't wait for season 2 and toys next year!!
True and the Rainbow Kingdom,Thanks! I actually worked on this as an animator. Glad to hear your kids like it!
True and the Rainbow Kingdom,I just hope there’s a giraffe at some point
True and the Rainbow Kingdom,reading this as a Halo fan: :D :(
True and the Rainbow Kingdom,All I see is the Prince of Dorne babysitting the Lady of Bear Island
True and the Rainbow Kingdom,"The filming crews shut down parts of Edmonton and Calgary, as well as several other locations in Alberta on and off for a year and..well, went crazy with the ""sets"". 

Like major roads into the city, and in the central business districts, etc... 

Without knowing a darn thing about the game, I can tell you the audience is in for a treat."
True and the Rainbow Kingdom,"I really hope the ""Joel, we really are the last of us"" and than they proceed to be the last of them scene stays true to the game and hits just as hard 😢"
True and the Rainbow Kingdom,"> The heartbreaking first 15 minutes of the game are depicted here, and Pascal’s performance underscores the blooming heartache that would fester into a shriveled, diminished soul.

No question, I’m ready to be destroyed again. Except now I’m a married man with a 2 month old, so I imagine this will hit that much harder"
True and the Rainbow Kingdom,starting at 84 on Metacritic
True and the Rainbow Kingdom,Paywall removed: https://archive.is/wip/n2yfL
True and the Rainbow Kingdom,My girlfriend has no idea what’s coming. Gonna be great to watch the show knowing everything while also being able to get her genuine surprise reactions
True and the Rainbow Kingdom,"Gene’s a great writer and huge videogame fan. If he signs off on it, this show is going to be amazing. Possibly eclipsing the game, narrative wise.

I suspect the shows success will open the floodgates for good videogame television series. Where writers work with developers to be faithful and make a good adaption."
True and the Rainbow Kingdom,Already drinking more water so I don't dehydrate from tears.
True and the Rainbow Kingdom,Part of me is very excited for this show but another part of me is a pc gamer who has somehow managed to avoid spoilers for this game and just learned that it’s finally coming to PC and now I just don’t know what to do!
True and the Rainbow Kingdom,Did people really doubt the creator of fucking Chernobyl?
True and the Rainbow Kingdom,"I know absolutely nothing about this game. Should I do some research to prepare myself for the show, or go in blind?"
True and the Rainbow Kingdom,My body is ready
True and the Rainbow Kingdom,[deleted]
True and the Rainbow Kingdom,"Halo and Witcher TV show, take some notes pls

Finally a good video game adaption, at least Cyberpunk and Arcane were too"
True and the Rainbow Kingdom,so best live action tv adaptation of video game? i know its not high bar.
True and the Rainbow Kingdom,"I'll shit my pants if it's 75% as good as the game, I'm so excited for my non-gamer friends to feel the things I have felt."
True and the Rainbow Kingdom,"Sorry for the obvious question, but when is this going to be released?"
True and the Rainbow Kingdom,"PC gamer. really wanted to watch the series, but don't want to ruin the experience. the tempation ooh,,temptation"

True and the Rainbow Kingdom,"Oh look a a director & a company who knows how not to piss off a fan base.

*Cough* paramount plus *cough*"
True and the Rainbow Kingdom,I'm just interested to see how the story is going to work with spores being removed.
True and the Rainbow Kingdom,I'm so nervous about introducing my wife to this. She watched me play some of part 2 but has no idea what's coming in the pilot and >!we just had our first child a year ago and so of course watching things in which kids suffer/die is now very emotional!<.
True and the Rainbow Kingdom,I hate that HBO is literally the only studio you can trust to adapt stuff properly for series. Wtf is wrong with Hollywood these days?
True and the Rainbow Kingdom,I am nearly done with my replay of part 1 :) I am so ready for this show.
True and the Rainbow Kingdom,"I'm still not giving my hopes up, but I am really starting to believe this might be amazing.

Please, don't fuck it up."
True and the Rainbow Kingdom,"So turns out when making an adaptation for a video game you *dont* need to mindlessly change every single detail for no reason and it works? What!?!?

It’s almost as if the reason it’s getting adapted in the first place was because the original product was actually good. Go figure."
True and the Rainbow Kingdom,"And it looks like they’re also releasing this in 4K, just like HotD. Things looks promising so far."
True and the Rainbow Kingdom,"i am so happy about this, i also can’t *wait* to see ashley johnson 😭😭😭"
True and the Rainbow Kingdom,"Sooo fucking stoked to check this out. 

I adore the games. Best storytelling out of any video game medium in my opinion.

The fact that Druckmann has been closely part of this project gives me immense hope and these reviews are feeding the fire.

I honestly haven't seen any promo material for this besides a few images here and there and my first thoughts were skepticism over their casting decisions but I've learned to accept these choices.

Sunday can't come soon enough."
True and the Rainbow Kingdom,Couldn’t be in better hands. I’m pumped! TLOU 1 and 2 are my favorite games. I even named my daughter Ellie ;x
True and the Rainbow Kingdom,"Just found out that the first season will cover the entire first game. That is such welcome news. I was worried they’d try and stretch this out over a few seasons. Honestly really, really excited now."
True and the Rainbow Kingdom,"Hyped! 

Can’t wait to see my wife be devastated so I can call her a loser for crying at a video game adaptation like she laughed when I cried playing the game."
True and the Rainbow Kingdom,The haters are going to lose it
True and the Rainbow Kingdom,I'm really hopeful for this.
True and the Rainbow Kingdom,Is the show going to be super gory? My playthroughs certainly were. Curious to see how true to the game the they handle the showdown with Ellie & David.
True and the Rainbow Kingdom,Do we have any idea how much story season 1 will be covering? Is it the whole game?
True and the Rainbow Kingdom,"Mazin is a boss, always had faith in him"
True and the Rainbow Kingdom,The television writer for this is Craig Mazin. He cohosts an awesome podcast called ScriptNotes for anyone interested in writing for film and tv.
True and the Rainbow Kingdom,"My daughter was about 15 when I played the 1st game, and she loved sitting in on the story while I played. It’s just us, so the special bond of Joel and Ellie hit home for both of us.  Then she wanted to go to comic con and we decided to go together and cosplay it. 

I’m so excited to watch our first HBO together, old school style weekly episodes. And she’s excited that next time we cosplay them people will know us haha."
True and the Rainbow Kingdom,Sigh of relief anyone?
True and the Rainbow Kingdom,I've never played the game but like apocalyptic series. Should I watch this? And what differentiates it from something like The Walking Dead?
True and the Rainbow Kingdom,What!!!??  wasn't it supposed to come on the 15th?
True and the Rainbow Kingdom,"I feel like the first episode is definitely going to be as upsetting as the opening was, so Yay... I guess. My wife is going to cry again and probably bust my balls for having her watch that again lol"
True and the Rainbow Kingdom,"Finished the first game a couple of days ago and started part 2 yesterday. Show must be absolutely brutal, then."
True and the Rainbow Kingdom,BuT tHeY Don't LoOK tHe SaMe aS tHe ViDeO Game! Worst show ever........ /s
True and the Rainbow Kingdom,"Can’t freaking wait, finally playing through part 2 right now"
True and the Rainbow Kingdom,Fuck yeah
True and the Rainbow Kingdom,This many awards for a link to a review in the first hour? Nothing sus about that.
True and the Rainbow Kingdom,Doubt
True and the Rainbow Kingdom,This and then LOVM season 2 in the same month. I'm excited.
True and the Rainbow Kingdom,"Damn, I wish I hadn’t told my wife every plot detail as I was playing through."
True and the Rainbow Kingdom,"The other day I was watching people reactions to that intro of the game (the scene with the security guard  right before the title shows up). I must have watched it like 10 times in a row, cried everytime"
True and the Rainbow Kingdom,"as long as we have at least one big boi rip off someones skull from the jaw, I'll be happy."
True and the Rainbow Kingdom,Play the game first or watch this first…hmm
True and the Rainbow Kingdom,I really gotta play this game finally
True and the Rainbow Kingdom,I hate these [weirdos](https://twitter.com/bigbybadb/status/1612722416530202625).
True and the Rainbow Kingdom,"I haven't played the game but its going to come out on March 3rd on PC. So, should I play the game first or watch the TV show first?"
True and the Rainbow Kingdom,Do you think it will be worth a watch for someone who doesn’t care about video games? Trailer looks good.
True and the Rainbow Kingdom,"it was so funny to see people calling it ""woke fanction"" in the last few days after the Gamer reaction to TLOU2. cannot wait to see hilarious flamin hot takes after this releases. congrats to all the production and folks who worked hard to get it made - and also to rational fans!"
True and the Rainbow Kingdom,If it’s anything like the game.. we are all in for a very good series
True and the Rainbow Kingdom,"Hopefully it wont be too long until they confirm and start shooting Season 2.

Also, while they've said that they don't want to do stuff beyond what we've gotten with the games, I honestly wouldn't mine some mini-series for some of the side characters. Bill & Frank, Henry & Sam, Tommy & Maria, Marlene and even Ish are all characters I'd be more than happy to see further explored, even if it's only like 4 episodes of 30 minutes each."
True and the Rainbow Kingdom,"I haven't even played the games, only know the story, and am very excited for this.

On some level, you just want some good TV, and them staying true to the source is a great endorsement for that"
True and the Rainbow Kingdom,"Is this just the first game, or does it include the second?"
True and the Rainbow Kingdom,Can't wait for season 2 what a disaster DOA
True and the Rainbow Kingdom,"No it doesn't. They didn't even keep the whole spore thing... Forced race swapping and odd choice of casting.  How is it faithful if the 3 main characters shown at the start aren't even the same race for starters?

What a snooze fest this first episode was. I was barely engaged, unconvincing characters, acting and world. Pretty cheesy.

Let's hope it'll change my view."
True and the Rainbow Kingdom,Good. Now start working on season 2 so we won't have to wait 2.5 years.
True and the Rainbow Kingdom,Like the Witcher was going to stay true?
True and the Rainbow Kingdom,Me when I make a cinematic game into a cinematic show and nothing changes 🤯🤯🤯
True and the Rainbow Kingdom,Nerds are going to be eating good in 2023
True and the Rainbow Kingdom,"Stays true, but didn't they change the cordyceps virus to have ""tendrils"" instead of spores? You know, something fundamental to the world building and dangerousness of it that provides very specific moments of terror/stress the game and should/would have been perfect for the show?"
True and the Rainbow Kingdom,"Looking forward to it, seems a little overhyped, and I heard they removed the fungal angle, and apart from the acting that was a really big part of the first game, gave the monsters a uniqueness and roots in reality which made it way creepier.

Cautiously optimistic tho!"
True and the Rainbow Kingdom,Did a stuido finale figure out that maybe it's not a bad idea to stick close to the source material?
True and the Rainbow Kingdom,All the whining about casting from Reddit but the trailer looked great.
True and the Rainbow Kingdom,"Sure they are, all shows are great when reviewed by corporate shields, and then they come out."
True and the Rainbow Kingdom,I’ll be the judge of that
True and the Rainbow Kingdom,Reassuring. The game is a complete and utter masterpiece and I hope the show will do it justice.
True and the Rainbow Kingdom,Pfft I’ll believe it when I see it
True and the Rainbow Kingdom,I KNEW THIS WAS GONNA BE GOOD
True and the Rainbow Kingdom,I’m so pumped for this!!!!
True and the Rainbow Kingdom,"bUT eLliE dOeSn‘T lOok LiKe ThE cHaRaCtEr In ThE gAmE….

hate these trolls…"
True and the Rainbow Kingdom,"The more journalists claim that, ""It remains true to the source material,"" the more I doubt it."
True and the Rainbow Kingdom,"This revier, Gene Park, gave a positive review to she hulk. Take that as you will"
True and the Rainbow Kingdom,"Stay true to game, literally first 10 mins Joel is mexican and his daughter is black"
True and the Rainbow Kingdom,"How many episodes did they get to review? First 3? Whole season? 

I read a review earlier that said the shows great, but didn't really get the point of it. Just made me think they must not have seen the whole thing."
True and the Rainbow Kingdom,Fucking paywall...
True and the Rainbow Kingdom,Seriously considering giving this a watch. Always sceptical of Video Game adaptions.
True and the Rainbow Kingdom,"Woah, an adaption of a franchise that *doesn't* butcher the source material?!?  

Are there really some good eggs in Hollywood after all?"
True and the Rainbow Kingdom,Stays true to the game…..uh didn’t they replace the fungus?
True and the Rainbow Kingdom,just like the game? so that means its a big as a lake but as shallow as a spoon? got it.
True and the Rainbow Kingdom,Is this releaed weekly or is it all available from the release?
True and the Rainbow Kingdom,I really want to read the review but that fucking login wall...
True and the Rainbow Kingdom,I’m going to cry so good
True and the Rainbow Kingdom,Hooray!
True and the Rainbow Kingdom,"This is the one, this is the GOT breaker"
Wet Hot American Summer: Ten Years Later,"Holy shit I didn't even know this was happening. I loved the movie and the show. Hopefully they didn't show all the cameos in the trailer, Cera and Pine were great surprises in First Day of Camp."
Wet Hot American Summer: Ten Years Later, I've never been happier to see a can of vegetables in my life. 
Wet Hot American Summer: Ten Years Later,Somehow the cast getting older just makes it even better and more absurd.
Wet Hot American Summer: Ten Years Later,"Okay, there's been a couple complaints at the lack of Bradley Cooper but...

WHERE THE FUCK IS MY DAVID HYDE PIERCE?"
Wet Hot American Summer: Ten Years Later,Release is August 4th
Wet Hot American Summer: Ten Years Later,"Christopher Merloni's character in these continues to be one of the funniest things I have ever seen.

Wet Hot American Summer: Ten Years Later,"My husband didn't like the movie or show, I spent a solid 10mins questioning my choice in mate. I can't even wait for this, I'll give husband a second chance to like it or I'm moving on. 20years and three kids are no reason to stay with someone who can't get behind this series."
Wet Hot American Summer: Ten Years Later,I will watching anything Stella-produced for the rest of my life.  This looks amazing.
Wet Hot American Summer: Ten Years Later,[deleted]
Wet Hot American Summer: Ten Years Later,"Im really surprised Paul Rudd has the time for this show.  Dude is busy as shit right now with two Avengers and Antman & Wasp.  
  
Edit : It just dawned on me, Paul Rudd, RDJ and Chris Pratt are all going to be in the same movie and quite possibly the same scene.  Can the world handle that much sarcasm? "
Wet Hot American Summer: Ten Years Later,"Rad, the prequel-series is so boss and the movie is killer; super siked for the wigs, mostly. Cowabunga. '91."
Wet Hot American Summer: Ten Years Later,This is going to be amazing. I laughed so out loud at the trailer a few times. Is this going to be another season of episodes or a movie?
Wet Hot American Summer: Ten Years Later,"This could be 10 episodes of Alan Shemper telling terrible jokes while the whole cast over reacts and I would probably watch.
"
Wet Hot American Summer: Ten Years Later,I would like to watch this program when it airs
Wet Hot American Summer: Ten Years Later,I hope the zoot suit makes an appearance.
Wet Hot American Summer: Ten Years Later,"I like that this show added the actors that I do not expect in the first place like Alysa Milano and Jai Courtney.

I hope that Amy Poehler and Adam Scott shared a scene together. "
Wet Hot American Summer: Ten Years Later,Looks like they got everyone back from the movie except Bradley Cooper?
Wet Hot American Summer: Ten Years Later,"Um,excuse me. Where is Jon Hamm?!?"
Wet Hot American Summer: Ten Years Later,"The ""First Day of Camp"" season was one of the dumbest and most entertaining things I've binged in a while. Had no idea this was happening but pretty excited now. "
Wet Hot American Summer: Ten Years Later,I laughed more at this trailer than I have at some comedy movies. 
Wet Hot American Summer: Ten Years Later,"Oh, good. Crisp Ine is back. Hopefully that means someone is taking something higher and higher."
Wet Hot American Summer: Ten Years Later,"the last series was fucking fantastic, I'm so hype for this. thank you based David Wain."
Wet Hot American Summer: Ten Years Later,Damnit Bradley Cooper!!! 
Wet Hot American Summer: Ten Years Later,Wait wait wait so the guy who's idea it was to meet up in 10 years isn't even in it??!? Why no Bradley Cooper?
Wet Hot American Summer: Ten Years Later,The more Victor & Neil scenes the better. These two are hilarious every single scene they're in.
Wet Hot American Summer: Ten Years Later,"Jesus what is that kid that says ""youre ruining the flow of my dick old man"" from? His face is so familiar!"
Wet Hot American Summer: Ten Years Later,"being someone who worked at a summer camp in college, this show means a lot to me. also, Gene is one of the best characters in any show ever"
Wet Hot American Summer: Ten Years Later,Oh my god this looks so dumb I love it.
Wet Hot American Summer: Ten Years Later,I hope the plot includes a plan to meet again in ten more years. 
Wet Hot American Summer: Ten Years Later,"You don't belong, Wiig, this isn't your camp. "
Wet Hot American Summer: Ten Years Later,Ttsss.
Wet Hot American Summer: Ten Years Later,Uuuuh the fuck is Bradley cooper? I need to watch him make sweet love to Michael Ian black. 
Wet Hot American Summer: Ten Years Later,"Unexpected Crossover:

I'm keeping that"
Wet Hot American Summer: Ten Years Later,"Wait...where's Bradley Cooper?!

>besides the scene from the movie"
Wet Hot American Summer: Ten Years Later,"Yes! This came out of the blue for me. Really loved the movie and the prequel series. Awesome!

And Jai Courtney is in this? That's great. "
Wet Hot American Summer: Ten Years Later,"Bradley Cooper didn't make it his bees wax to be there, I guess."
Wet Hot American Summer: Ten Years Later,"Finally, the messed up version of Gene has returned."
Wet Hot American Summer: Ten Years Later,I can't wait to see this! I've tried so hard to get other people into this and no one has bitten yet. So fuck them I'll just binge it on my own :D
Wet Hot American Summer: Ten Years Later,I remember watching the original with some friends and everyone loved it. What they didn't know is I had activated the fart track in the special features.
Wet Hot American Summer: Ten Years Later,I watched on a whim in a theater i lived by in college...after it ended i went and got my buddy we bought some 40s and some burritos and i went in for round 2. Fucking great flick...also smoked pot 
Wet Hot American Summer: Ten Years Later,Didn't this already happen?
Wet Hot American Summer: Ten Years Later,Fuck. Yes.
Wet Hot American Summer: Ten Years Later,This looks like too much fun!

Wet Hot American Summer: Ten Years Later,"Fuck I love Michael Showalter, the guy is just so hilarious looking."
Wet Hot American Summer: Ten Years Later,"I really like the fact that I have not seen one negative comment about this series. Seems everybody is excited for it and rightfully so, this shit is gold. The can is going to steal the show for me again."
Wet Hot American Summer: Ten Years Later,Starting Paul Rudd as Eddie Vedder from Singles. 
Wet Hot American Summer: Ten Years Later,This is old no?
Wet Hot American Summer: Ten Years Later,These are comedy gold! 
Wet Hot American Summer: Ten Years Later,I was on the set as an extra one day.
Wet Hot American Summer: Ten Years Later,Where's David Hyde Pierce?? 
Wet Hot American Summer: Ten Years Later,What a grand time for my Netflix to be having issues
Wet Hot American Summer: Ten Years Later,Legit wished for this to happened last month-wish granted. So happy
Wet Hot American Summer: Ten Years Later,Christopher Meloni was hilarious as Jonas/Gene.  Can't wait for this.
Wet Hot American Summer: Ten Years Later,"""Oh yes, this looks amazing."" 

With Jai Courtney

""Nevermind"""
Wet Hot American Summer: Ten Years Later,"I worked at the actual summer camp where whas was shot... it was a difficult shoot because in the movie, it was hot and summery... on location, it was cold, rainy, windy, and muddy! 

I had nothing to do with the movie, but often interacted with the cast and crew... seeing Paul Rudd in Antman makes me giggle because he is so small in real life! Also, Bradley Cooper seemed so awkward amongst the rest of the cast... during shooting, at cast parties, just chilling by the lake... yet he's turned out to be probably the biggest star! I can tell the cast and crew really gelled, and I'd definitely go see the sequel. 

Funny thing is I thought nothing of the first film, hadn't heard of it showing anywhere, until I encountered a group of people obsessed with it and I went to their movie night in 2007ish (filmed in 2000) and everyone in the room knew all the lines! I tried to explain that I was actually there when it was shot... they reacted like I was making it up. 

That movie also has some other strange appearances in my life since 2000... and now the sequel? Of course, amiright?

Wet Hot American Summer: Ten Years Later,"I love the show. I saw this and was curious, so I  looked at the reviews when googling.  Every single review  I read that was negative was a reason why I watched it."
Wet Hot American Summer: Ten Years Later,No David Hyde Pierce? 
Wet Hot American Summer: Ten Years Later,David Wain is consistently the best comedy director of this generation.
Wet Hot American Summer: Ten Years Later,This is gonna be great! I loved the prequel show. 
Wet Hot American Summer: Ten Years Later,"Dammit Netflix, you were supposed to learn from Hollywood's mistakes and stop trying to make Jai Courtney happen. It's just not going to happen"
Wet Hot American Summer: Ten Years Later,Jai Courtney seals the deal for me
Wet Hot American Summer: Ten Years Later,Am i the only one who doesn't get the appeal?
Wet Hot American Summer: Ten Years Later,"Wait, so Netflix is making two different series for a movie that they don't even have the streaming rights to? Seems odd, I'd definitely watch this and the other series if the movie was on Netflix."

The Hollywood Masters,"Try this place.

The Hollywood Masters,"Great website, but I can't find it there. :\ Thanks anyway!"
The Hollywood Masters,"This guy has the strangest resume ever.  Wrote a bunch of those parody movies, the 2 ok-ish sequels to The Hangover and a shitty Melissa McCarthy movie to all of a sudden is churning out stuff like Chernobyl and TLOU."
The Hollywood Masters,"From the article:

> Craig Mazin was ready for a change.

> About a decade ago, Mazin had carved out a solid career as a comedy screenwriter. Though his credits were hardly going to win over critics — “Scary Movie 3” and “Scary Movie 4” as well as the second and third installments of the “Hangover” trilogy, among them — the calls from Hollywood executives kept coming. It was a steady and lucrative job.

> Still, there was something missing.

> “A lot of what I would be offered was stuff where they’re like, ‘Who can fix this thing?’” Mazin recalled in an interview late last month. “Or ‘Can somebody get it from a C-plus to a B-minus?’”

> Eventually he decided that “I’m better than the work I’m being offered,” he said.

> That was the first crucial step in what would become a remarkable midcareer ascent. Over the last four years, Mazin, 51, has spawned two hit HBO series and transformed himself from a comedy screenwriter into one of the hottest showrunners in premium scripted television."
The Hollywood Masters,"He's got to have a blank check and a golden ticket now, right? After helming an almost universely acclaimed prestige mini-series and then adapting a video game into a huge weekly watercooler show? 

As much as I love the Last of Us and am really excited to see Part 2 adapted, I'm almost more excited to see what he chooses to do next"
The Hollywood Masters,This is a just desserts for the poor guy who had to be Ted Cruz’s roommate in college.
The Hollywood Masters,Btw I highly recommend the Scriptnotes podcast Mazin hosts with John August for anyone interested in screenwriting.
The Hollywood Masters,"I read Mazin is a big fan of Mass Effect, so get this dude to adapt ME asap!"
The Hollywood Masters,All I want to say is that Craig Mazin is great because he’d hop onto the r/ChernobylTV post episode discussion threads and chat for a bit with Redditors and just give his appreciation for all the love and support. Solid dude.
The Hollywood Masters,"I know I'm stating the obvious, but he's got a fantastic eye  at conveying story telling through subtle details. I love checking out the HBO weekly podcast on the show after an episode airs mostly because of him as he goes into great detail( alongside Neil) on the decision making behind all the pivotal scenes  of each episode and gives you a stronger appreciation for how seriously they're treating the project and that nothing was included ""by accident"". His passion for the source material is infectious."
The Hollywood Masters,thinking about rewatching Chernobyl cause Last of Us is so good
The Hollywood Masters,"Besides being a puff piece that just rehashes old stuff, the most interesting thing is that the budget is around 150 million dollars for the first season of TLoU. That is more than I expected they would give the show, I guess."
The Hollywood Masters,"""Who would have thought that not butchering the source material of what you are adapting would prove successful"" - Hollywood probably"
The Hollywood Masters,"Netflix may have more money, but HBO spends their money on great content, love this show and can’t wait for more from Mazin!"
The Hollywood Masters,Can we also take a moment to mention how he fucking crushed being the believably horrible Lou in Mythic Quest?
The Hollywood Masters,Craig if you ever read this. Please do Mass Effect. You’re the only one who can do it right. It would be the greatest story ever told on television
The Hollywood Masters,Scary Movie 3 is still a masterpiece. I will die on this hill
The Hollywood Masters,People have asked me what I think about the production and I always tell them the same thing: it’s definitely a Mazin.
The Hollywood Masters,"Mazin pros: His writing.

Mazin cons: Not realizing he didn't pay 10% agents fee.  Not protecting his assistants in pay issues."
The Hollywood Masters,NY Times Photographer: We just need a quick cover shot for the article. Just stand against this wall and put your hands up like you just touched raw chicken and are gonna wash your hands.
The Hollywood Masters,He’s such a good success story. Man did a lot of shitty Melissa McCarthy movies to get paid them just pumps out one of the best tv shows with Chernobyl then follows it up with the last of us.
The Hollywood Masters,Listen to his podcast.. he seems kinda annoying.
The Hollywood Masters,"In the time it takes you to read the article, he'll have been offered the shot at making a Star Wars movie, which will then inevitably be cancelled before you even make it to the comments section."
The Hollywood Masters,"Everyone rightfully praises Mazin for TLOU and Chernobyl, but he also wrote one of the single best TV episodes I’ve ever seen (Mythic Quest, Backstory, S02E06). He is extremely talented, and is probably one of the best working writers at this very moment."
The Hollywood Masters,“Craig Mazin’s A-Mazin Hollywood Ascent” was right there. Be better NY Times.
The Hollywood Masters,Episode 3 of the show proves he can come up with original material that’s on par with what Druckmann created for the game and I think that’s really cool.
The Hollywood Masters,TIL the director of last of us did Chernobyl
The Hollywood Masters,"Since Mazin is a frequent Reddit user, hi, Craig!"
The Hollywood Masters,Crazy he wrote Scary Movie which have single handedly ruined my enjoyment of Scream in a good way 🤣
The Hollywood Masters,Can’t help but always say Craig Mazin with a Liverpool accent in my head 😅
The Hollywood Masters,Not a good guy unfortunately. But he has a great publicist who asks the NYTimes to do these pieces for him.
The Hollywood Masters,"I dunno, I think most of it was written for him"
The Hollywood Masters,Would LOVE to see him and Jordan Peele work together..that’d be INSANE.
The Hollywood Masters,It's a good show...but great?  No
The Hollywood Masters,The Last of Us is the most boring zombie and/or dystopic piece of entertainment I’ve ever seen.
The Hollywood Masters,Really? Because it looks like a step down from Chernobyl to me.
The Hollywood Masters,That picture looks like he doesn’t know what to do with his hands
The Hollywood Masters,Can he do the Witcher next :(
The Hollywood Masters,"After listening to him for years on ScriptNotes I was not going to miss the premiere of Chernobyl.  And I'm glad I didn't, and I'm glad he has found projects that highlight his talent."
The Hollywood Masters,"I remember the episode on the Scriptnotes podcast when Chernobyl got greenlit. He said it was something important to him and what he always wanted to do. Proud of you, “Sexy Craig.”"
The Hollywood Masters,"I read an article somewhere and he said that he did these movies because... paycheck.  The guy needed to make a living, and this was a way to do it, get contacts in the Hollywood system and eventually get enough experience that people would listen when he pitched something.

Mission accomplished."
The Hollywood Masters,Have you ever listened to his SCRIPTNOTES podcast?  You can tell from multiple discussions on that show that writers (and specifically him) are often servicing someone else’s framework and visions while working to earn a living. It’s a quite interesting listen if you’re interested in screenwriting at all.
The Hollywood Masters,"Also, Ted Cruz’s freshman year college roommate and nemesis"
The Hollywood Masters,He actually works as a script doctor and has helped several movies where he was uncredited. All those movies you mentioned were just for paycheck
The Hollywood Masters,[Here's his AMA response to that](https://old.reddit.com/r/ChernobylTV/comments/cc76ib/ama_with_showcreator_craig_mazin/etmaw2r/)
The Hollywood Masters,"A paycheck is a paycheck. It’s like Noah Hawley going from writing a handful of episodes of Bones to somehow being the guy behind Fargo and Legion. Very rarely is a really talented writer getting exactly what they want to the screen on those early projects and they’ve still gotta make a living. Compare that to actors who star in a bunch of stinkers or strange early roles that get forgotten or become a fun punchline as soon as they hit it big. 

I think we’re a bit more judgmental with writers because we forget how much studio interference is involved in most scripts."
The Hollywood Masters,Don't worry I'm sure the Borderlands movie he wrote that has been stuck in post-production hell for an eternity will muddy the waters even further.
The Hollywood Masters,"He also famously rescued the original GOT pilot.

https://www.nme.com/news/tv/screenwriter-says-original-game-of-thrones-pilot-w-884904"
The Hollywood Masters,"I hope he keeps succeeding, if only because he had the misfortune of rooming with Ted Cruz at college and constantly heckles him on social media."
The Hollywood Masters,"People seem to understand, but not accept, that Hollywood is likely the hardest industry in the world to break into, and that you’re gonna be a janitor for a long time before they let you even close to the junior sales floor."
The Hollywood Masters,"I never really realized who he was other than from his face. I had recently watched Mythic Quest and listened to The Watch podcast late breakdown of Chernobyl they did prior to TLOU. 

The name Mazin stuck in my head because I remembered it from the credits of Mythic. Was completely shocked when I realized that he was the guy that had done Chernobyl and TLOU."
The Hollywood Masters,"You cannot - ever - judge a screenwriter by an assignment script. Unless you've read one of their spec scripts, all you're seeing is their attempt to make the best of a likely bad situation, filtered through several more complete different variables."
The Hollywood Masters,Senseless was pretty great though
The Hollywood Masters,& he was college roommates w Ted Cruz
The Hollywood Masters,"Say what you will about the Hangover sequels, they both had some pretty clever visual storytelling. They’re the gold standard of unnecessary cash-grab sequels."
The Hollywood Masters,Reminds me of Peter Jackson when he started doing LOTR
The Hollywood Masters,A lot of people in Hollywood have that kind of résumé. A bunch of stuff on the résumé to get the experience and then they get a chance to prove themselves.
The Hollywood Masters,"I've watched several comedies that Mazin has written, and I think they're awful. I consider Hangover 2 and 3 to be textbook examples of what not to do with sequels.

Meanwhile, The Last of Us is almost impeccable television. I haven't seen Chernobyl, but I read nothing but positive things about it.

This dude found his secret sauce around 2018-2019. Whatever it was, it's working."
The Hollywood Masters,"So far all his original stories have been garbage.

His current hot streak is because he is adapting stories that he doesn’t have to make up. He was able to research Chernobyl to death. And The Last of Us was plotted out ahead of time for him by the games.

I love Last of Us. But I’m reserving putting Craig Mazin on a pedestal until he writes something original and good."
The Hollywood Masters,To pimp a butterfly.
The Hollywood Masters,"I get what you mean, but I don’t think it’s as strange as you would think for a writer. As others have said, for many writers, the first thing you have to do is make a living."
The Hollywood Masters,"You should check out Scriptnotes, the podcast he hosts with fellow screenwriter John August. They had Patton Oswalt as a guest last week, and they basically shot the breeze about working earlier rooms where they were brought in to polish turd scripts, and basically said no matter how much they tried, some scripts (and even movies that were already shot) were beyond saving without completely throwing everything out. The studios would be like, “Well, we already spent all this money on this, so we’re not gonna start over.”"
The Hollywood Masters,Screenwriters write scripts lol. They dont really control or influence final output 99% of the time. Unless its some renowned director with some passion project.
The Hollywood Masters,He also wrote one of the best episodes of Mythic Quest to date.
The Hollywood Masters,"And let’s not forget he went to Princeton from a humble background, where he was freshman roommates with Ted Cruz. That is proof of struggling to the top."
The Hollywood Masters,"It's addressed in the article. Hollywood only sees you for what you've done, not what you can do.  I'm sure he was pigeonholed for years.  He's incredibly lucky he got Chernobyl."
The Hollywood Masters,This is why I rarely blame the writer for a movie. Or at least define their quality by them. Hah
The Hollywood Masters,"Thanks OP, subscription walls on this stuff are dumb"
The Hollywood Masters,"It'll be a minute, since he's committed to at least two more seasons, with likely multi-year gaps between each."
The Hollywood Masters,"Listening to the podcast about TLoU, in episode 1 it pretty much sounds like he already had a blank check to do whatever he felt like after Chernobyl.

Craig Mazin is amazing in that podcast in explaining his thoughts and decisions. Same with the Chernobyl one."
The Hollywood Masters,"He needs to strike while the iron is hot.  All it takes is one bad season or bomb, and all the goodwill disappears in a moment.  Get that bag."
The Hollywood Masters,"Hope he sticks with HBO and premium TV, whatever he ends up doing. I think he could easily be the next David Simon"
The Hollywood Masters,"This is the blank check project. By all accounts HBO was not seeking out a TLOU show, Craig brought it to them and they wanted to work with Craig on something he was passionate about"
The Hollywood Masters,I hear it’s Metroid Prime
The Hollywood Masters,He wrote the Borderlands movie...very interested to see his version of a video game adaption that's the polar opposite of TLOU.
The Hollywood Masters,HBO needs to lock him up to a deal if they haven’t already. They did a piece on Casey Bloys who is the head of HBO and they seem to already have a solid relationship.
The Hollywood Masters,"Wait what?

Edit: just looked it up I thought it was an inside joke. 

What a cruel origin story."
The Hollywood Masters,I had never heard this before! This dude has the craziest story arc. One day he will write a script about his own life and people will say it’s too unbelievable.
The Hollywood Masters,I read Cruz as Bundy and was very confused.
The Hollywood Masters,Didn't know this was a thing.  Thanks I've got something new to binge!
The Hollywood Masters,"Wow, there are *a lot* of episodes. Should I start current and go back? Or start at the beginning? Cherry pick episodes maybe?"
The Hollywood Masters,It's the gold standard for aspiring screenwriters and it is genuinely fantastic.
The Hollywood Masters,I started listening to this after watching Chernobyl. I stopped listening to this after Mazin’s “how dare you criticize D&D for how GoT ended” speech.
The Hollywood Masters,"Craig Mazin isn’t involved, but *Andor* has some *Chernobyl* alums - the production designer, and also Stellan Skarsgård, Robert Emms, and Alex Ferns."
The Hollywood Masters,"3.6 roentgen. Not great, not terrible."
The Hollywood Masters,"I’ve never seen it, planning on starting it when TLoU ends."
The Hollywood Masters,I just started a rewatch because of TLOU. Forgot how much the first episode is framed as a horror film. It's so fucking good.
The Hollywood Masters,That’s exactly what I’m going to do to fill my time between the Last of Us finale and Succession season 4 premiere
The Hollywood Masters,"I know that House of Dragon had 200 million for its first season while Westworld cost 160 million for its last season. Do we know how much did the previous seasons of Euphoria, White Lotus and Succession cost?"
The Hollywood Masters,"Where’d the money go? Not on the screen, that’s for sure"
The Hollywood Masters,"It’s never that straightforward. Adaptation is an art and a skill itself. Sticking slavishly to the source material could get you The Godfather, making radical changes could get you Bladerunner or John Carpenter’s The Thing. It’s not about “change as little as possible”, it’s understanding what can change, what has to change, what can remain and what has to remain. It fails so often precisely because its a complicated problem with no simple solution."
The Hollywood Masters,"""Going forward should we maybe try to stick to the source material more?"" 

""No that's just crazy talk"" - Basically any studio that's not HBO."
The Hollywood Masters,"I wonder if part of the problem isn’t that we aren’t letting these creators make original works anymore so they feel compelled to try and put their own “improvements” on these adaptations since it’s the only stuff getting made and they’ll never get another opportunity.

I’m not excusing it, because it’s been mostly hot garbage, just wondering.

Like that recent Netflix Resident Evil show felt like someone took a zombie apocalypse script they wrote and just changed all the names of everything from stuff they got off the RE wiki."
The Hollywood Masters,"To be fair though, no other games have source material as strong as TLOU. Lots of them would make pretty lackluster movies/shows even if they were directly adapted."
The Hollywood Masters,"HBO have the advantage of being on the prestige tv industry for longer as well. So they have built a fantastic production pipeline and the legacy to lure talented artists in, like Craig."
The Hollywood Masters,"Netflix's chief of TV (Bela Begaria) does not care about critical acclaim, she's said as much. She also doesn't get why critically acclaimed hits like Queens Gambit are popular as it was greenlit before her tenure"
The Hollywood Masters,Love the episode he co-wrote!
The Hollywood Masters,Killed it as the living embodiment of ACKSHUALLY
The Hollywood Masters,"I definitely wish he’d let Neil and Troy talk more. Mazin seems super nice and is great at breaking down the episodes, but damn… he talks so much that Troy can barely ask any questions and Neil can’t answer any."
The Hollywood Masters,He likes to hear his own voice for sure. I can picture Druckman just staring waiting for his turn to speak
Entangled,"I guess if that kraut mick tom hagen can be consigliere, then so can this guy."
Entangled,Other than the one episode where they include a gay character and decide to trash it in typical korean fashion.. the show was good
Entangled,"Reminds me of Yakuza 0, there was a similar storyline there"
Entangled,My wife got me into K-Dramas atm watching reply 1988. Vicenzo is on the list
Entangled,The clip and description makes me wonder why I never heard of this series. Seems interesting
Entangled,"I loved this show

I binged it when I was out with Covid"
Entangled,"This series is amazingly bonkers man, i seriously cannot recommended it enough! Just watch it's so good"
Entangled,"Netflix's K-Dramas are honestly their best and most complete offering of content they have. I usually find a good show every few months to binge through, keeps me occupied for a week."
Entangled,Heroes. Talking about not having a long-term plan or outline of where you want the story to go...
Entangled,"The original first three seasons of Arrested Development. Fox didn’t know what the hell they had. I distinctly remember seeing commercials for it and thinking that it looked like the stupidest sitcom ever shat out. The commercials focused on the zanier moments and practically had sound effects, like boing and slide whistles. A few years later I actually watched it and obviously it’s amazing. Fox did not know how to market something so ground breaking (for the time)."
Entangled,Firefly. The studio execs switched the order of episodes so that the plot arc didn't make sense and then canceled it before they finished the season.
Entangled,"Designated Survivor


show had something like 4 showrunners in the first two seasons?"
Entangled,"The Expanse. 

I loved every season, every episode, but for Amazon to only give the showrunners 6 episodes to finish it up was a joke. They did a great job putting it together, but the show needed a proper 10 episode arc. 

Here's to hoping that someday, we will be able to continue the journey on The Expanse.

The books are awesome, by the way."
Entangled,"The third season was officially titled as Master of None Presents: Moments in Love in the advertising. But they presented it as season 3. Netflix does spinoffs quite a bit. This is one that should have been listed as season 1 of a spinoff show, not season 3 of an old one. That was the mistake. And I love Lena as a writer but she is absolutely not a talented actress, especially as a lead, to me.


That said, the situation with Aziz had no effect on this. Netflix said they'd do a third with him whenever he wanted even after his mini scandal. Aziz didn't do a normal third season because he said he wants to be in a different place in his life before he does, like married with kids. He's only just gotten married this year."
Entangled,Happy Endings. They never settled it onto a single time slot.
Entangled,"Almost Human.

Cop who hates androids in a sci-fi future (like Blade Runner 2049 except remarkably less dystopian somehow) is forced to partner with an android that he calls 'one of the crazy ones' when the latter is introduced. Show dealt with a lot of internet style crime (serial killer streamer who was obsessed with validation from his chat, targeted ad software being the backbone for self-guided bullets for assassinations, smart homes killing their occupants with security systems) and was building to something where a major robotics genius essentially went rogue and was on the verge of building a terminator army for terrorists. Which the main guy's ex-girlfriend possibly worked for.

That was at the halfway point where the main guy's hatred of robots had already decreased substantially and the potential interplay with his robot partner had promise (""I'm sorry I scanned your balls"" will always be funny to me because of a certain scene they had together). Then it turned out Fox messed with the order of episodes and what was supposed to be episode 2 was instead the episode after the mid-season break, and the main guy is suddenly back to hating robots so much he literally just shoots a cop robot unprovoked and he's much colder towards his robot partner.

Show had a lot of promise, but Fox absolutely murdered it by not showing it in the order as intended, so they could get more 'action' filled episodes earlier in the season."
Entangled,"Better off Ted, Pushing Daisies, Firefly, and Galavant didn’t get the runs they deserved.

Arrested Development, community, game of thrones didn’t get the final seasons they deserved."
Entangled,"Man in the High Castle. They should have just made it an alternate history show. Instead, they leaned into that bizarre Sci-Fi plot really hard and the ending was breathtakingly terrible."
Entangled,"Fear The Walking Dead

It was fresh and different and the characters were fantastic. 4th season they wipe it all away and decide to make it the Morgan show"
Entangled,Happy Endings and Don't trust the B in Apt. 23. Both were aired out of order by the network which confused people and led to cancellation
Entangled,"Basically anything Fox has touched.    

Dark Angel ended on a pretty big cliffhanger in season 2 that just never got resolved because it was cancelled for Firefly.    

Firefly was aired out of order despite being a narrative story and then cancelled when things were just heating up (at least we got a movie).    

Prison Break had the opposite happen. It was originally two seasons with the heroes escaping by boat at the end. Fox wanted more so the story was extended forcefully. Season 3 is a-lot weaker than the previous 2 and season 4 goes off the rails.     

Happy Endings was also a great show that got screwed, although this is by ABC. The good old mess up the order of episodes for a narrative. Still went on to have 2 more seasons but ended with a cliffhanger."
Entangled,"Avatar the Last Airbender and the Legend of Korra were both botched by Nickelodeon (thought Korra got it tougher for sure)

For avatar they didn't mess with the production but they had no idea how to air the series. They started out airing reruns of a serialized show out of order, like they did with Spongebob. 

Then for book 3 they aired half of it weekly, took a 6 month hiatus and then dumped the 2nd half all in 1 week. 

For Korra they ordered book 1 as a miniseries, then ordered book 2 when book 1 was almost finished. Books 3 and 4 were ordered well into the production of book 2. So this meant that books 1 and 2 were written to be series finales, since they didn't know they would be picked up for more. And it meant that there isn't much connective tissue between books until books 3 and 4 when they knew they'd have more story to tell.

They cut the budget of book 4 by the amount needed for 1 episode during the production so they had to make a clip show episode to reduce costs

Nick put book 2 in the Friday night death slot, wondered why ratings dropped and then moved distribution to online only in the middle of book 3 airing"
Entangled,"American Gods - /thread

Arrested Development - Netflix seasons. Should have waited for availability of actors"
Entangled,Surprised I didn't see community. They whipped Dan Harmon around for that series
Entangled,Poorly managed or mismanaged not poorly mismanaged unless you mean well managed.
Entangled,"I wouldnt really say the first two seasons of Master of None ended with cliffhangers, they just ended in a way that you’d be left having to assume what Dev did with his life rather than us getting to see every step of the way towards some happily ever after story. Honestly I think those first two seasons perfectly stand on their own as needed, plus he said he didn’t wanna do more till he was in a different place in his life and the show could reflect that."
Entangled,"Better off Ted.

Great show, but the network never gave it a chance. No ads for it at all."
Entangled,Heroes. Great 1st season!! Then an absolute dumpster fire.
Entangled,"If we’re talking mismanaged on the production side, I’d have to say Inhumans. Look at the reported budget, and then look at the actual production quality of the show. They spent so much money to look that cheap.

Same thing with The Witcher."
Entangled,Poorly mismanaged = Well Managed
Entangled,"Twin Peaks. Executives made David Lynch reveal the murderer too early, moved the show from prime time to less popular days (iirc more than once and at random, so unless you were following the news really closely, you wouldn't be aware your show was suddenly on Tuesdays at 11pm), hired writers who created the James plotline abomination, and then found, pikachuface, that the Nielsen ratings were low, which led to cancellation."
Entangled,[deleted]
Entangled,The Wilds
Entangled,Community.
Entangled,"Don't Trust The B In Apt 23.  It should have been on Fox, but they passed.  ABC put it behind Modern Family, not really a compatible show.

Then they moved it to a different time slot, and started airing the episodes out of order, which demolished one of the ongoing story lines.

Then they gave up and cancelled it.  A great show."
Entangled,Sliders and sleepy hollow
Entangled,"Pedantic alert: “poorly mismanaged” means they were well managed 🙂 i think you meant “poorly managed”.

Also, Season 3 of _Master of None_ was purely Aziz’s creative endeavor. Netflix didn’t make him focus on Lena Waithe’s character, he made that choice himself. He co-wrote and directed all 5 episodes (and basically re-did _Scenes From a Marriage_). 

And Aziz didn’t get cancelled. He had a setback during the height of MeToo, that was more or less deemed a non-story after a while (don’t want to get into the merits or demerits of the claims in the story). He’s directing a movie now (but might get canned due to Bill Murray’s antics). He also had 2 Netflix specials since that story came out."
Entangled,"MASH. They tried to mismanage it by insisting on a laugh track and killing off Henry Blake but still couldn’t steal the shine from this stellar show. So, their attempts to mismanage were poorly done - it was poorly mismanaged."
Entangled,Game of thrones past season 5
Entangled,"The Thundercats reboot. Cartoon Network ran one episode a week, never did reruns, barely advertised, then moved it to a worse time slot where it was subsequently dropped. Very sad because it was a great show."
Entangled,I'm a Walking Dead fanboy. But AMC ruined the potential of that show. I still love it. But recognize the flaws.
Entangled,"Sliders. What an absolute clusterfuck of a show that became with such an awesome premise. Fucking cromags, what a load of shit"
Entangled,"Aziz wrote and directed the entire 3rd season. He is very vocal that it was the direction HE wanted to take the show in. The show was always a reflection of his real life, and his real life did take a turn after his ""scandal"" or lack thereof."
Entangled,"I’ll never understand how they so completely dropped the ball with Battlestar Galactica. The first few seasons were so brilliant, then they added in the secret seven (or however many) that made zero sense, then it just kept getting more and more absurd."
Entangled,Dexter
Entangled,"Altered Carbon. Season 1 had the ideal protagonist, with a snarky AI-controlled hotel as an ally, in an awesome non-dystopian future with plenty of lore. There was so much to explore, so many potential cheeseball 90s one-liners between the hotel and the goofball main character, so many mysteries to solve. Then, Season 2 has a brand new story and protagonist, no badass hotel.

Ted Lasso. S1 was an absolute banger, completely new and fresh like the equivalent to a modern day blockbuster movie. Great amount of sports, funny and sharp as hell, perfect fish-out-of-water story with a character whose positivity could've turned him into a household name if he hadn't been prematurely flanderized, a perfect America v England/EU dynamic/contrast to explore, so many genuine characters that didn't need any embellishment to be interesting. They had every single thing they needed already established in the first season, then S2 throws gasoline on the whole thing, changes characters, tugs at heartstrings in unearned ways with constant melodrama, tries to function as socially aware but never gets more than superficial at best. I had such a good time with S1, it really pissed me off to see what this show turned into."
Entangled,The walking dead by getting rid of frank Darabont
Entangled,Hell on wheels. What started off as an amazing series went way off the rails
Entangled,Heroes
Entangled,How to Make It in America. Great show. HBO tried to ride the Entourage coattail.
Entangled,"Sleepy Hollow. Fantastic first season. Great main cast. Lots of set up and worldbuilding. 

And then season two happened. The whole thing went right off the rails and never pulled itself back together."
Entangled,Sleepy Hollow. Way to blow a lead. 🤦🏾‍♀️
Entangled,Poorly mismanaged? Does that mean they were managed well?
Entangled,"The Batwoman series on the CW.  It was practically an easy success, as the comics had a well developed character to work with.  Instead, the writers go hyper-gay, hyper-womanized with the show when it didn't need to lean that heavy on those, and I say that as a bisexual person.  Made the show hard to watch.  The terrible writing on top of that made me quit after the first story arc with Alice."
Entangled,"It's difficult to say definitively which TV shows were poorly managed, as this can be a subjective judgment that depends on individual viewers' preferences and expectations. However, here are a few examples of TV shows that have faced criticism for various reasons related to their management:

""Game of Thrones."" This show faced criticism for its rushed final season, which some viewers felt did not do justice to the complex characters and storylines that had been built up over the course of the series.

""Arrested Development."" This show faced criticism for its fourth season, which was released several years after the previous season and featured a new narrative structure that was confusing to some viewers.

""The Walking Dead."" This show faced criticism for its declining quality and inconsistency in storytelling, as well as for the departure of several main characters and the subsequent introduction of new ones.

""Doctor Who."" This show faced criticism for its uneven quality, with some seasons being well-received and others being less popular with viewers. It has also faced criticism for its handling of diversity and representation, with some viewers feeling that the show has not done enough to include more diverse actors and storylines.

It's worth noting that these are just a few examples, and the management of a TV show can be affected by many different factors. It's also important to keep in mind that TV shows are often the result of the combined efforts of many different people, including writers, producers, directors, and actors, and that it can be difficult to pinpoint specific reasons for why a show may be perceived as being poorly managed."
Entangled,"Legacies 

One lead actress quit due to homophobia behind the scenes. 

Plus, It always felt like none of the writers actually communicated behind the scenes because the episodes would always be so inconsistent. One scene it would be a character literally breaking up with their girlfriend the next minute they sleep together."
Entangled,American Gods
Entangled,The Chi. What an absolute diaster from the new Wire to a tyler perry first draft
Entangled,Dexter is a wild ride with characters and plot lines.
Entangled,"Heroes. Great first season, but it was clear they had no idea where they intended to go beyond that point."
Entangled,Star Trek: Enterprise.
Entangled,"Poorly mismanaged, as in managed well? Poorly managed, or mismanaged, I get. Poorly mismanaged is a double negative so they cancel and it just means ""managed""."
Entangled,True Detective. I don’t think I’ve ever experienced such a drop off of all around quality from season one to season two compared to any other show I’ve seen.
Entangled,"Firefly. 

Cancelled mid season yet was popular enough that they made a Hollywood movie to wrap it up? Yeah the network blew it."
Entangled,"1st season was pretty solid, second season felt like a chore to get through dropped season three part way in, would not go back for a fourth if there were to be one."
Entangled,"Wouldn't something that's poorly mismanaged actually be managed well?

I think you meant either ""poorly managed"" or just ""mismanaged""."
Entangled,"Prison Break. The first season was originally 13 episodes but the show as a hit so they added 13 more. The problem is the whole initial premise that a guy perfectly planned and executed a prison break was tossed aside so they could extend the show. They should have just kept the original idea, have them escape at ep 13. The come back with a new idea for the rest of the season/future seasons. 

I gave up on the show but it went on for 5 seasons and from what I heard it progressively got worse. It feels as if had the show come out 10-15 years later it could have been a cool anthology show like Fargo where each season is different with maybe a couple loose threads tying them together."
Entangled,"The X-Files reboot. Chris Carter had pretty clearly run out of ideas by the end of the original run. The reboot radically changed existing characters, brought back previously deceased characters in ways that made no sense, and badly mishandled its serialized elements.

It would have been better if others had taken the lead with Carter in a consulting role or just not made it at all."
Entangled,"almost human. 

fox kept fucking with the episode order, and airdates. it was a decent show, but given zero chance."
Entangled,"No show in the history of television has had a worse management than firefly. Not only did the network air the first few episodes out of order but they also kept changing what time it was on, setting it up for ratings failure"
Entangled,"So, managed well?"
Entangled,The last season of Jane the Virgin was a huge drop in quality for what was then the best portrayal of American women in television
Entangled,Battlestar Galactica
Entangled,"After reading a lot of responses, did airing episodes out of order EVER result in a good show?"
Entangled,wouldnt being poorly mismanaged mean they failed at mismanaging it? so poorly managed or just mismanaged is probably what you were looking at.
Entangled,"**masters of sex** (gorilla scene, anyone?) and **nashville** come to mind -- both started off so strong and went downhill in later seasons, so frustrating."
Entangled,"If something is poorly mismanaged, does that mean it was very well managed?"
Entangled,Firefly
Entangled,Anybody said Prison Break? The first season was some of the best television out there then crap after. My personal theory is that the show should have been called something else so they didn't have to go back to prison every season. The poor writers.
Entangled,Castle after the OG producers left the show
Entangled,You mean like your post title?
Entangled,Poorly managed or greatly mismanaged?
Entangled,"Everything made by Marvel on Netflix after Jessica Jones.
And truth be told a bunch of the Disney+ stuff too."
Entangled,"Nah, I thought season 3 was dope, came out of left field and felt like an interesting and thoughtful departure from a pattern that may have gotten stale pretty quickly. I assumed that this wasn't Dev's story and so we wouldn't get closure on some of the things that had happened 3 years prior. I like when writers force you to make some inferences and leave some ambiguity, feels more realistic than wrapping everything up in a nice bow."
Entangled,Westworld.  Lost.
Entangled,"Yeah, I don’t know WTF they were doing. Loved season 1 and 2. Couldn’t get past the first episode of season 3."
Entangled,That would be Arrow. It was good the first two season. After that it went downhill
Entangled,The witcher after season 1 on netflix
Entangled,"Mr Robot was all over the place. If you missed any part of an episode, you ended up totally lost"
Entangled,"How the top 20 comments aren’t all **The Walking Dead** is beyond me.

I love the graphic novel, Frank Darabont fucking nailed that first season, it was perfect and true to the source material. 

Then AMC greed, a never ending court case and Scott Gimple slowly sucked life from the franchise over the course of 7 seasons or so. Angela Kang turned it around somewhat, but it became a chore to watch in parts when could have been truly special all the way through."
Entangled,Live action Cowboy Bebop was a masterclass in bungling a franchise.
Entangled,This is Us had such an amazing cult following but the constant mid-season breaks killed the momentum
Entangled,Lost started awesome then the studio wanted more season then Abrams has planned so it slowly slid in the crapper the end being like shoving a cactus up your ass bad
Entangled,The correct answer is Firefly.
Entangled,"Master of None season 1 was so good, I really enjoyed it. Was hoping season 2 would be very similar. That wasn't the case for me. I watched a couple episodes, was confused why Aziz wasn't the focal point and stopped watching. Was really disappointed"
Entangled,"The Leftovers. It started out as an interesting character study involving the timeless concept of how people deal with spectacular loss. It immediately devolved in season 2 to a bizarre jaunt through the funhouse where weird shit happened seemingly just for weirdness’ sake. Really interesting ideas and arcs are constantly ditched for the next wildly crazy thing. Almost nothing is ever followed through on this show.

The “Let the Mystery Be” song was perfect for the last two seasons as it reflected what the show runners were doing. “We have no idea where we are taking this, but just go with it. We promise it’ll be different, but don’t ask us what’s going on. We have no clue.”"
Entangled,"Lost. 

The Blacklist.

Entangled,Amazon LotR
Entangled,"Game of Thrones. 
How HBO let those two idiots David and Dan ruin it is still mind blowing."
Entangled,"LOST, the writers said they had a plan for the entire show, the studio demanded more seasons along the way, the show then became a mess until they just ended it with , ""fuck it, they were dead all along""."
Genius of the Ancient World,"It's a long article, here's where it says the problems start:

>At some point during the third season of Rick and Morty, multiple sources say Roiland simply stopped showing up — and when he did turn up in the Burbank offices, he’d typically avoid the writers room. In fact, Roiland’s colleagues often knew he was there only because they could hear his dogs. Or they’d hear his remote-control toy car, which had a microphone on top of it, zooming around the office. At least once, Roiland sent it into the writers room, says a source. “You wouldn’t have seen him in weeks, and then you’d see the car come in, which was insane.” Roiland would make exceptions to bring through famous fans, of which Rick and Morty has legions; at various points, his visitors included Kanye West, the comedians on Impractical Jokers and porn star Riley Reid, who gifted the room a succulent.

 
>By that time, Roiland had a girlfriend, who became a fiancée, and he would talk openly about their penchant for threesomes. “It was something we just ignored because it was disgusting,” says an insider. Multiple sources say it was also during that period that Roiland sent a female employee a “really creepy” text, late at night, requesting that she come to his home (they declined to name the staffer). “She didn’t want to run it up the flagpole,” says one of the sources, “and then it was just this really fucked-up, awkward thing.”

His Relationship with Dan Harmon:

>In the meantime, the relationship between Harmon and Roiland had grown so acrimonious that the show brought in a mediator to try to salvage what was once an inspired partnership. And though those efforts were unsuccessful, the pair was able to put aside their differences enough to secure a massive, 70-episode renewal from Adult Swim in May 2018. The pact, which ensured that the show would run for several more seasons, appeared to reward Rick and Morty for its precedent-smashing ratings for Adult Swim; by season five, the Emmy-winning series was reportedly generating hundreds of millions in merchandise revenue alone.

>In the years since, Roiland’s involvement on Rick and Morty has largely been relegated to voicing characters, for which he’d take no direction and record from his home. In fact, it has been years since anyone can remember him stepping foot in the show’s writers room, even when it’s been virtual. Recently, a similar situation has occurred on both Solar Opposites and Koala Man, according to multiple sources. On the former, which he co-created, he had, until mid-January, voiced one of the show’s leads. “He knew the power of being the voices,” says a source, noting how Roiland had revealed early on that he believed securing key voice roles would safeguard him from being fired one day. On Koala Man, on which he’s simply an executive producer, he was given a character to voice in the show’s third episode but, per two sources, the writers almost blew their deadline waiting for him. The character was killed off at the end of the episode."
Genius of the Ancient World,Who knew that Dan Harmon would turn out to be the affable one?
Genius of the Ancient World,"The Roiland and Harmon part was pretty interesting, had no clue they had such issues with each other. I wonder if there was a single event or just what was discussed in the article that strained it?"
Genius of the Ancient World,"Sounds like Rick and Morty losing Roiland is not really going to effect that much, get a new voice actor or two and maybe they’ll actually show up and take direction. Could overall be a net positive for the series."
Genius of the Ancient World,"I really, really want to know what I have to do to get a job where I…

- Make millions
- Surround myself with geniuses
- Win my industry’s most prestigious awards
- Gain an army of rabidly enthusiastic fans
- Get more responsibilities and opportunities

…while also…

- Rarely show up to work, FOR YEARS
- Be loud and derailing in meetings
- Sexually harass women the instant I gain professional access to them
- Blow company money at Toys-R-Us
- Make everyone around me look and feel bad

And literally not one person rats on me? Fires me? Blows my shit up? Not one?!

Like. How. Where. What do I have to do to get a life where I am coddled like a precious boy-king."
Genius of the Ancient World,Why is he Sonic
Genius of the Ancient World,"The only time I've heard Justin Roiland speak (as himself) was an episode of Harmontown he appeared on. The dude seemed really out there. Like on drugs AND a crazy weirdo.  When listening I was thinking ""uh oh...he's one of those show runners. The kind who will be in the news eventually"""
Genius of the Ancient World,So...like [John Kricfalusi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Kricfalusi) and *Ren & Stimpy*?
Genius of the Ancient World,"A tale as old as time: “We were always aware of the unethical/illegal actions of this person who made all of us a lot of money, but didn’t want to say anything until the actions are already made known to the public.”"
Genius of the Ancient World,"It’s amazing how often this article repeats how Rolland is barely involved with Rick and Morty, as if to ensure it can continue on Adult Swim with minimal blowback.

That said, would Roiland still benefit from royalties even as he is cut off?"
Genius of the Ancient World,"I don't think Roiland was ever considered a genius, unlike Dan Harmon. He was funny, with a lot of energy, and was a big part of the show's success... but that's not genius territory."
Genius of the Ancient World,"I don't know about the rest of yall, but I never attributed R&M success to roiland, I always thought it was Harmon with a good writing room. I always assumed roiland was just voice work...and not good work at that. All his fucking voices sound damn near identical...except Rick IS unique compared to the rest."
Genius of the Ancient World,"Is it really a surprise that fans felt his career was ""suddenly derailed"" when the reason why was kept a secret up until just recently?"
Genius of the Ancient World,"Honestly I'm hopeful that the R&M writers will make the best of this. From this article and others it seems like Harmon and the other main show runners have been done with Roiland for a LONG time and he hasn't had meaningful creative input. Hopefully this is like a weight lifted for the rest of the writing staff.

The bigger unanswered question as I see it is what the next season will be like. Fairly sure it's already completely written (and maybe completely voiced too?) So do they rerecord Roiland's lines? And I feel like they'll have to add in at least a 30 second joke about the voice change. I hope the show carries on the same or better though 🤞"
Genius of the Ancient World,"As a fan of the show (who’s used to liking things with awful fan bases) I was always annoyed by roiland and thought that he was only around because the seed of the idea was his from back in channel 101 days… but it’s so obviously Dan harmon’s show and ideas.

edit: originally autocorrected fan bases to canvases lol"
Genius of the Ancient World,Never meet your heroes
Genius of the Ancient World,"I'm reminded of what happened to Noel Clarke in the UK. BAFTA fellowship winner to career effectively over in under a week when 20 women came forward with claims of bullying, verbal abuse and sexual harassment. 

ITV had to pull the final episode of a ""stripped"" series from regular airing when the advertisers bailed, Sky had to cancel *Bulletproof* and BAFTA revoked his fellowship. No charges were filed due to lack of evidence, but he's done."
Genius of the Ancient World,You either die a Morty or live long enough to to see yourself become the Rick ah geee
Genius of the Ancient World,"He always gave off a manchild vibe, like he never actually matured to adulthood. Good riddance, I suppose."
Genius of the Ancient World,Clearly this is another example of sex addiction a disease that overwhelmingly affects rich and powerful men.
Genius of the Ancient World,"“More recently, multiple sources say that Roiland, other than voice work, has not had any meaningful creative presence on any of the series that bear his name. In fact, many of his former colleagues say they haven’t heard from him in years, and when they have, it’s been unpleasant.”

I have been theorizing this for YEARS and I’m not just saying that because this article is shitting on him. I’ve always felt like he’s been a hyped up voice actor, with the limit of his creativity in R&M being the designs of the characters and Ricks ship. I’d be curious to see what else he came up with, but it’s always seemed like he did barely enough to earn that co creator title with Dan Harmon, who actually writes it. Maybe Rolland came up with the idea, which would make him a creator, but that’s the bare minimum of what people consider a creator."
Genius of the Ancient World,Can these people just stop being creeps so that shows/movies/music stop getting ruined
Genius of the Ancient World,"“I turned my self into a felon, Morty! I’m WIFE BEATER RIIICCKKKK!!”"
Genius of the Ancient World,"I had heard from a chick I knew, of his predilection. She said he was into 3 ways, but also mid teenage girls. Something like once he had some $ or any amount of power/fame he used it to hookup with the girls that wouldn't have given him the time of day when he was still a nobody."
Genius of the Ancient World,"The moment I heard that Justin Roiland and Alex Hirsch had been hanging out together a lot, I knew exactly what was wrong. This guy doesn’t show up to work and thinks he’s the hottest shit for the work he doesn’t show up to anymore"
Genius of the Ancient World,"I wish I was surprised by the fans' reaction, but I'm just not."
Genius of the Ancient World,Imagine you're in a meeting and the boss drives a little R/C car in there with a microphone stuck on top and just parks it lol
Genius of the Ancient World,Eerie similarities with John K. and how that sexual predator went down in flames.
Genius of the Ancient World,It derailed before that. He was apparently a raging alcoholic. I hope he finds help.
Genius of the Ancient World,"I love how it's always ""quirky genius"" instead of ""fucking asshole"" until the appalling behavior comes to light."
Genius of the Ancient World,"Let's be real, who isn't really excited to see the next season now?

First you have two main characters getting recast and you know damn well they will find fantastic talent. Even if you can just barely hear a difference, I'm looking forward to that. And the obligatory meta scene about it. Hell make a whole episode plot about it!

Plus I always felt Harmon was the man behind the great story telling. And now this just confirms it. Without Roiland, I bet that Harmon won't be hindered by Justin's douchebagerry and we will see some of the
Best story telling the show has seen.

And there is a part of me that wants Roiland to watch R&M succeed even more so without him just so he can feel some negative emotions and knock that fucker down a few pegs."
Genius of the Ancient World,Is there anyone here that remembers Bewitched?  One week they just replaced the dad and no one said a thing. I was confused but the new dad was a huge improvement from the old one.
Genius of the Ancient World,"Dude was never a genius. He was a drunk idiot who did funny voices and threw out ""lolsorandom"" ideas in the writers room at best. Guy cant write a story to save his life and the best thing hes ever come up with is Lemongrabs scream. He never has or could, so I never understand why people think just cause his names in the opening titles that hes actually making these stories. Every episode is writers + Harmon with random shit sprinkled in by Justin. Writers + Harmon alone will be fine and probably better as the weirdest fans of this show always seemed to be the ones on Roilands dick."
Genius of the Ancient World,He sounds like an asshole who made something cool once or twice. R&M is hilarious.
Genius of the Ancient World,"I always scratch my head after reading a story like this, in which only one the interviewees is quoted as being concerned about whether this individual was inappropriate with a female colleague. Everyone else is worried about the prestige of their creative products. I’m not saying you can’t worry about that—of course, it’s natural—I’m saying…Roilands are everywhere, and they proliferate in part because most people do not care about the targets of their abuse until it becomes a larger issue."
Genius of the Ancient World,"I've heard from people who know him that he's a total dick. Like, obviously funny from afar, but insufferable if you have to interact with him."
Genius of the Ancient World,I have a family member who works in the entertainment industry and they told me years ago that there’s been rumors of this stuff. Sucks to hear it’s true.
Genius of the Ancient World,It would be great if his punishment could also somehow include McDonald's Szechuan Sauce.
Genius of the Ancient World,Never go full John K
Genius of the Ancient World,"Following his Instagram years ago was what led to that realization for me. Getting that extra little look into how he is when he openly expresses himself quickly tipped me off that this guy just isn’t right. He really just comes off as this emotional immature, overly volatile person who can never identify when to stop. And that last one is a big sticking point"
Genius of the Ancient World,"Not a single person I know, fans included, were surprised by this"
Genius of the Ancient World,"It’s always great when the people in power who had the ability to call out shitty behavior years ago, all come out after the fact to say they knew about it. See Harvey Weinstein."
Genius of the Ancient World,This was not shocking to me. Rick and Marty while intelligent is clearly a cry for help and the “method acting” behind the scenes video he put out of him getting drunk in the office back in like 2017 was the first indicator to me that he was unwell mentally in some capacity.
Genius of the Ancient World,Quirky? I thought the mofo was just creepy
Genius of the Ancient World,"It's not a long list, but I've never found people who have to drink to be creative to be good people. It's well known that Justin and many of the other writers would get drunk in the writing room and Justin would get drunk to do his voice acting work.

Roosterteeth is another company that's going through some controversy now and has always had a pretty steep drink culture.

I say this as someone who drinks, and likes to get drunk when the mood is right. If you have to get shit-faced to make entertaining stuff you've got a problem."
Genius of the Ancient World,"Someday, maybe “colleagues” will speak up in these situations.  

Unless we want more George Santoses and Justin Rollandses?"
Genius of the Ancient World,"While interesting I'm kinda skeptical of tabloids after watching Harry & Meagan. But really does make you think, curious what Harmon's take on this guy is."
Genius of the Ancient World,Can’t trust someone in thin glasses
Genius of the Ancient World,"""Suddenly derailed"" by charges from like two or three years ago 🤔"
Genius of the Ancient World,Imagine being such a maniac that Dan Harmon is the adult in the room.
Genius of the Ancient World,"Not to downplay Roiland as being a massive creep, but I have to admit; I did get a bit of a chuckle out of the article's attempt to wring maximum salaciousness out of the Riley Reid angle by framing it as him ""parading a high-profile porn star"" around the writer's room as if he had her naked and filming a hardcore scene in front of everyone to their maximum discomfort, when apparently it sounds like it was actually one of the more wholesome parts of this whole affair. She bought them all a houseplant for heaven's sake!"
Genius of the Ancient World,Seems to me they put this article out in an attempt to assuage fans of their fears that this guy leaving will destroy the show.  It’s no different from an advertisement in the form of an article.
Genius of the Ancient World,You read the bizarre defenses of talking about threesomes in the workplace and then you understand why the Rick and Morty fanbase is considered so toxic.
Genius of the Ancient World,"All the people here saying ""I always thought Dan Harmon was the genius...not Justin Roiland"" are so full of shit. Some of us were here on Reddit when Rick and Morty originally dropped and y'all had Roilands cock so far down your throats."
Genius of the Ancient World,Ah geez 😳
Genius of the Ancient World,"I am glad to hear he wasn't doing the writing. At least I know the show won't be missing that aspect and I don't care much if Morty changes a little. The only question is how much was riffing that I enjoyed in dialog, but I am sure an actual voice collaborator will make up for this."
Genius of the Ancient World,100 years
Genius of the Ancient World,"Honestly not to sound judgmental but I wasn't surprised when it came out he had been messaging underage girls, the kind of ""jokes"" he was making a lot of the time on podcasts were in line with that."
Genius of the Ancient World,I would be willing to bet a large sum of money that Dan Harmon has lots of sexual misconduct skeletons in his closet
Genius of the Ancient World,It turns out the toxic fan base is recantation of Roiland himself
Genius of the Ancient World,"I guess it’s not surprising that Justin turned out to be pretty fucking weird and exploitive, given how his creative career started with insane shit like Doc and Mharti

Like, I’m pretty sure most people that weren’t totally disgusted by it were thinking “holy shit this guy is nuts, I wonder what would happen if he was given a real budget and a staff”. Fast forward and… he’s an abusive sociopath! Surprise!"
Genius of the Ancient World,"So he hasn't been involved in the show's writing room since season 2.

That's weird, everyone at /r/rickandmorty kept saying how essential he is to the future of the series."
Genius of the Ancient World,"I’ve suspected that the writers have long detected red flags with Roiland.

While these companies are free to work with anyone he and to a degree Harmon seem to be the type of people you should probably have a “parted ways” statement on standby."
Genius of the Ancient World,How is this a surprise. He’s a POS and said some really weird stuff to minor girls through DMs. Doesn’t help how unfunny he is either; always the same stupid voice
Genius of the Ancient World,"How brave of these colleagues to speak up now after the crimes have been made public and their comments don’t impact their own ability to make money. 

True heroes."
Genius of the Ancient World,But no one  still listens to Chris Brown right??
Genius of the Ancient World,"Justin Roiland's contributions weren't even really to writing. His idea of writing is just making up characters with silly names like ""Shploobie Bibbles"" and juvenile gross-out humor. 2 of his 5 writing credits over 6 seasons of R&M were inter dimensional cable, which we all know is largely improvised, and see my point above about Shploobie Bibbles. New voice for the titular characters will be the biggest change, and I doubt very many reasonable people will end up giving a fuck."
Genius of the Ancient World,His behavior was troubling in public.  I listened to one episode of his podcast and felt like my soul needed a powerwashing afterwords.
Genius of the Ancient World,Thumbnail at a glance makes him look like a bad Sonic the Hedgehog OC.
Genius of the Ancient World,Lol I saw him as sonic in the thumbnail instead of Rick and was very confused
Genius of the Ancient World,So all the people freaking out about Roiland's involvement blew it way out of the proportion outside or doing voices
Genius of the Ancient World,But Elon Musk said he’s the heart of the show!
Genius of the Ancient World,When did assholery become ok some might say. Others would say it’s always been. I’m sad for folks who he wronged. Feel stupid for finally getting to these shows and then this.
Genius of the Ancient World,What a big dumb douchebaggy bag'a douche.
Genius of the Ancient World,"&#x200B;

Holy shit, the [tiny RC car with a camera](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ii6XuM187Zo) on it is real"
Genius of the Ancient World,"Amazingly well researched article. 

What a creepy fuck this Roiland turned out to be"
Genius of the Ancient World,Next time they gonna say is that he started his own religion. Pigs are people.
Genius of the Ancient World,"If story accurate, all he did was make himself easy to replace. Never a good idea in any job. His role was get the ball rolling and voice work. Like any exec producer really.  

This is different then why most of us thought which was he was neck deep in the day to day work of getting the shows made and so his voice (literal and figuratively) were a critical component. That clearly isn’t the case.

If you think all those Steven Spielberg producing credits was him rolling up his sleeves and getting to work, you lost your minds. His roll was to pitch it, get the money on board and then sit back, let everyone do the actual work and reap the benefits.

After that the actual creatives did the heavy lifting of the writing, directing, animating while Roiland just did voice work from comfort of home. Not saying voice actors are not important, but unlike some live action shows, they can be replaced as there are many that can mimic the voice.

As for his silence, well duh. Even a first year law student will tell you to “shut the f—- up” when involved in criminal and civil cases. The worse thing he can do is say anything. Look at Adam Baldwin and his ill advised interview and how that is going to be used against him."
Genius of the Ancient World,"For a man who created Rick Sanchez, I'll say it again, I'm not that surprised."
Genius of the Ancient World,"Ahh yes, Hollywood reporter, they’re not bias or clickbaity."
Genius of the Ancient World,"It really sounds like roiland just kept being himself and the success made everyone else be more cautious and that just didnt vibe with the “we are successful now so we must change” turn everyone took

You know, excluding the abuse stuff which is obviously terrible"
Genius of the Ancient World,Whoda thought that the alcoholic who disguises hedonism as “complex” nihilism is actually an annoying and crass human being.
Genius of the Ancient World,Incoming netflix docuseries
Genius of the Ancient World,Yoga
Genius of the Ancient World,How is everyone in this comment section ignoring the fact that he's a huge pedo? That news is definitely what resulted in adult swim cutting ties.
Genius of the Ancient World,"so basically, everything was fine as long as he brought them fame and power? yeh, sounds bout right."
Genius of the Ancient World,Roiland trying to be Rick in real life.
Genius of the Ancient World,When I first saw Rick and Morty I thought it was funny. When I saw that everything he has ever done is the same damn voice and humor I found him way less funny.
Genius of the Ancient World,It’s always guys like Roiland that try to get their reports to join them for a threesome. 🤢
Genius of the Ancient World,"An episode aired last night with the toxic versions of Rick and Morty and it never occurred to me that Morty seduced two grown ass women, until just then. Never really put much thought into some of the shit that happens in the show until this stuff started coming out."
Genius of the Ancient World,"I really like Solar Opposites, more than R and M. It’s a shame celebrities turn into raging douche canoes when they get a little money in the bank"
Genius of the Ancient World,"He’d get shitfaced drunk to record his lines for Rick, how anyone would be surprised that he isn’t an alcoholic piece of shit outside of the recording booth is beyond me."
Genius of the Ancient World,"Quirky genius? No, fuck that. 

I once pointed out awhile back, before the accusations began, that someone whose entire fame started with a BTTF parody in which Doc Brown wants Marty to suck him off, might not be the most stable guy in the room. I got downvoted to hell for it because you can't question the 'genius"" of some artists I guess. Those fans helped this guy gain his power, that he went on to abuse other creators and artists. They saw a guy who went through a lot of trouble to make the joke, ""a grown adult  wants oral sex from a teenager"" and said, ""shut up and take my money"" and he went on to become a grown adult trying to fuck teenagers. 

Who.

Fucking.

Knew."
Genius of the Ancient World,"They should just write in Morty going through a late puberty, hire an actor with a crazy deep voice and never mention it again"
Genius of the Ancient World,"Any true fan would have seen this coming a mile away, when I saw his method acting video like 4 years ago, I knew he had a lot of demons and trauma he wasn't able to deal with and his alcoholism was only going to get worse and get him into trouble."
Genius of the Ancient World,He stopped showing up around the Third season? That’s when it all went downhill quality wise
Genius of the Ancient World,This show is has been a minefield for its staff. I find it weird that few articles are mentioning the sexual harassment instances with Harmon as well.
Genius of the Ancient World,"I first became a fan of Justin’s when he started his podcast way back in 2010. Generally he came off as a good person, with a crazy sense of humor, quirky ideas, and love for his friends and fans. He’d even get deep talking about his childhood, sense of paranoia for the future, and depressive episodes. Sometimes he’d come off as somewhat controlling, but it was his show after all. Just like in Rick and Morty he also did characters that went on comedic rants that were over the top, overtly sexual, scatological (lol), and just straight up funny and weird. Even if he responded to fan mail as one of these characters going on a lewd rant, he’d come back as Justin and usually say it’s just for the shock comedy and he loves his fans. Fast-forward to today and I’m not sure how to feel about Justin… Worst case scenario, he was always an abuser deep down and it’s just finally come to light. Best case is he spiraled out of control under pressure becoming the personalities he always portrays in characters. Of course neither are excuses. I hope any victims get justice. I hope Justin gets therapy. And I hope the friends and family of everyone involved are doing ok."
Genius of the Ancient World,"TBH he kind of sucked and all his 'projects' were him just him riding the coat tails of Rick and Mortys success, and doing the same characters again and again."
Genius of the Ancient World,"Rick and Morty fan here, and I hope most other fans can agree with this next statement, fuck this guy, we don’t need him, just find other people to voice his characters."
Genius of the Modern World,"Note you can watch the episodes on what appears to be called Hannah Fry's Official YT channel if you're not in the UK.

https://youtube.com/@HannahFryOfficial

Also her podcast with Dr Adam Rutherford ""The Curious Cases of Rutherford and Fry."" Is excellent."
Genius of the Modern World,This doesnt seem to have an imdb entry. Weird.
Genius of the Modern World,"I listen to the Curious cases of Rutherford and Fry, and Hannah Fry has one of the most charming demeanors. They're a lot of fun to listen to, and explain things that a layman can understand, but takes you deeper into a subject, too. If she's hosting a new show, I think I can safely say it's worth watching."
Genius of the Modern World,I'm always down for something nature or science or engineering by the BBC. Always delivers.
Genius of the Modern World,You had me at Connections.
Genius of the Modern World,Thank you. I’ve been watching them with a VPN and a friend’s postcode on a BBC account
Genius of the Modern World,Is the podcast available outside UK?
Genius of the Modern World,"That is odd, only three eps aired, and on the iPlayer so far."
Genius of the Modern World,Yes. I listen to it from overseas.
Genius of the Modern World,"It's a long article, here's where it says the problems start:

>At some point during the third season of Rick and Morty, multiple sources say Roiland simply stopped showing up — and when he did turn up in the Burbank offices, he’d typically avoid the writers room. In fact, Roiland’s colleagues often knew he was there only because they could hear his dogs. Or they’d hear his remote-control toy car, which had a microphone on top of it, zooming around the office. At least once, Roiland sent it into the writers room, says a source. “You wouldn’t have seen him in weeks, and then you’d see the car come in, which was insane.” Roiland would make exceptions to bring through famous fans, of which Rick and Morty has legions; at various points, his visitors included Kanye West, the comedians on Impractical Jokers and porn star Riley Reid, who gifted the room a succulent.

 
>By that time, Roiland had a girlfriend, who became a fiancée, and he would talk openly about their penchant for threesomes. “It was something we just ignored because it was disgusting,” says an insider. Multiple sources say it was also during that period that Roiland sent a female employee a “really creepy” text, late at night, requesting that she come to his home (they declined to name the staffer). “She didn’t want to run it up the flagpole,” says one of the sources, “and then it was just this really fucked-up, awkward thing.”

His Relationship with Dan Harmon:

>In the meantime, the relationship between Harmon and Roiland had grown so acrimonious that the show brought in a mediator to try to salvage what was once an inspired partnership. And though those efforts were unsuccessful, the pair was able to put aside their differences enough to secure a massive, 70-episode renewal from Adult Swim in May 2018. The pact, which ensured that the show would run for several more seasons, appeared to reward Rick and Morty for its precedent-smashing ratings for Adult Swim; by season five, the Emmy-winning series was reportedly generating hundreds of millions in merchandise revenue alone.

>In the years since, Roiland’s involvement on Rick and Morty has largely been relegated to voicing characters, for which he’d take no direction and record from his home. In fact, it has been years since anyone can remember him stepping foot in the show’s writers room, even when it’s been virtual. Recently, a similar situation has occurred on both Solar Opposites and Koala Man, according to multiple sources. On the former, which he co-created, he had, until mid-January, voiced one of the show’s leads. “He knew the power of being the voices,” says a source, noting how Roiland had revealed early on that he believed securing key voice roles would safeguard him from being fired one day. On Koala Man, on which he’s simply an executive producer, he was given a character to voice in the show’s third episode but, per two sources, the writers almost blew their deadline waiting for him. The character was killed off at the end of the episode."
Genius of the Modern World,Who knew that Dan Harmon would turn out to be the affable one?
Genius of the Modern World,"The Roiland and Harmon part was pretty interesting, had no clue they had such issues with each other. I wonder if there was a single event or just what was discussed in the article that strained it?"
Genius of the Modern World,"Sounds like Rick and Morty losing Roiland is not really going to effect that much, get a new voice actor or two and maybe they’ll actually show up and take direction. Could overall be a net positive for the series."
Genius of the Modern World,"I really, really want to know what I have to do to get a job where I…

- Make millions
- Surround myself with geniuses
- Win my industry’s most prestigious awards
- Gain an army of rabidly enthusiastic fans
- Get more responsibilities and opportunities

…while also…

- Rarely show up to work, FOR YEARS
- Be loud and derailing in meetings
- Sexually harass women the instant I gain professional access to them
- Blow company money at Toys-R-Us
- Make everyone around me look and feel bad

And literally not one person rats on me? Fires me? Blows my shit up? Not one?!

Genius of the Modern World,"Let's be real, who isn't really excited to see the next season now?

First you have two main characters getting recast and you know damn well they will find fantastic talent. Even if you can just barely hear a difference, I'm looking forward to that. And the obligatory meta scene about it. Hell make a whole episode plot about it!

Plus I always felt Harmon was the man behind the great story telling. And now this just confirms it. Without Roiland, I bet that Harmon won't be hindered by Justin's douchebagerry and we will see some of the
Best story telling the show has seen.

And there is a part of me that wants Roiland to watch R&M succeed even more so without him just so he can feel some negative emotions and knock that fucker down a few pegs."
Genius of the Modern World,Is there anyone here that remembers Bewitched?  One week they just replaced the dad and no one said a thing. I was confused but the new dad was a huge improvement from the old one.
Genius of the Modern World,"Dude was never a genius. He was a drunk idiot who did funny voices and threw out ""lolsorandom"" ideas in the writers room at best. Guy cant write a story to save his life and the best thing hes ever come up with is Lemongrabs scream. He never has or could, so I never understand why people think just cause his names in the opening titles that hes actually making these stories. Every episode is writers + Harmon with random shit sprinkled in by Justin. Writers + Harmon alone will be fine and probably better as the weirdest fans of this show always seemed to be the ones on Roilands dick."
Genius of the Modern World,He sounds like an asshole who made something cool once or twice. R&M is hilarious.
Genius of the Modern World,"I always scratch my head after reading a story like this, in which only one the interviewees is quoted as being concerned about whether this individual was inappropriate with a female colleague. Everyone else is worried about the prestige of their creative products. I’m not saying you can’t worry about that—of course, it’s natural—I’m saying…Roilands are everywhere, and they proliferate in part because most people do not care about the targets of their abuse until it becomes a larger issue."
Genius of the Modern World,"I've heard from people who know him that he's a total dick. Like, obviously funny from afar, but insufferable if you have to interact with him."
Genius of the Modern World,I have a family member who works in the entertainment industry and they told me years ago that there’s been rumors of this stuff. Sucks to hear it’s true.
Genius of the Modern World,It would be great if his punishment could also somehow include McDonald's Szechuan Sauce.
Genius of the Modern World,Never go full John K
Genius of the Modern World,"Following his Instagram years ago was what led to that realization for me. Getting that extra little look into how he is when he openly expresses himself quickly tipped me off that this guy just isn’t right. He really just comes off as this emotional immature, overly volatile person who can never identify when to stop. And that last one is a big sticking point"
Genius of the Modern World,"Not a single person I know, fans included, were surprised by this"
Genius of the Modern World,"It’s always great when the people in power who had the ability to call out shitty behavior years ago, all come out after the fact to say they knew about it. See Harvey Weinstein."
Genius of the Modern World,This was not shocking to me. Rick and Marty while intelligent is clearly a cry for help and the “method acting” behind the scenes video he put out of him getting drunk in the office back in like 2017 was the first indicator to me that he was unwell mentally in some capacity.
Genius of the Modern World,Quirky? I thought the mofo was just creepy
Genius of the Modern World,"It's not a long list, but I've never found people who have to drink to be creative to be good people. It's well known that Justin and many of the other writers would get drunk in the writing room and Justin would get drunk to do his voice acting work.

Roosterteeth is another company that's going through some controversy now and has always had a pretty steep drink culture.

I say this as someone who drinks, and likes to get drunk when the mood is right. If you have to get shit-faced to make entertaining stuff you've got a problem."
Genius of the Modern World,"Someday, maybe “colleagues” will speak up in these situations.  

Unless we want more George Santoses and Justin Rollandses?"
Genius of the Modern World,"While interesting I'm kinda skeptical of tabloids after watching Harry & Meagan. But really does make you think, curious what Harmon's take on this guy is."
Genius of the Modern World,Can’t trust someone in thin glasses
Genius of the Modern World,"""Suddenly derailed"" by charges from like two or three years ago 🤔"
Genius of the Modern World,Imagine being such a maniac that Dan Harmon is the adult in the room.
Genius of the Modern World,"Not to downplay Roiland as being a massive creep, but I have to admit; I did get a bit of a chuckle out of the article's attempt to wring maximum salaciousness out of the Riley Reid angle by framing it as him ""parading a high-profile porn star"" around the writer's room as if he had her naked and filming a hardcore scene in front of everyone to their maximum discomfort, when apparently it sounds like it was actually one of the more wholesome parts of this whole affair. She bought them all a houseplant for heaven's sake!"
Genius of the Modern World,Seems to me they put this article out in an attempt to assuage fans of their fears that this guy leaving will destroy the show.  It’s no different from an advertisement in the form of an article.
Genius of the Modern World,You read the bizarre defenses of talking about threesomes in the workplace and then you understand why the Rick and Morty fanbase is considered so toxic.
Genius of the Modern World,"All the people here saying ""I always thought Dan Harmon was the genius...not Justin Roiland"" are so full of shit. Some of us were here on Reddit when Rick and Morty originally dropped and y'all had Roilands cock so far down your throats."
Genius of the Modern World,Ah geez 😳
Genius of the Modern World,"I am glad to hear he wasn't doing the writing. At least I know the show won't be missing that aspect and I don't care much if Morty changes a little. The only question is how much was riffing that I enjoyed in dialog, but I am sure an actual voice collaborator will make up for this."
Genius of the Modern World,100 years
Genius of the Modern World,"Honestly not to sound judgmental but I wasn't surprised when it came out he had been messaging underage girls, the kind of ""jokes"" he was making a lot of the time on podcasts were in line with that."
Genius of the Modern World,I would be willing to bet a large sum of money that Dan Harmon has lots of sexual misconduct skeletons in his closet
Genius of the Modern World,It turns out the toxic fan base is recantation of Roiland himself
Genius of the Modern World,"I guess it’s not surprising that Justin turned out to be pretty fucking weird and exploitive, given how his creative career started with insane shit like Doc and Mharti

Like, I’m pretty sure most people that weren’t totally disgusted by it were thinking “holy shit this guy is nuts, I wonder what would happen if he was given a real budget and a staff”. Fast forward and… he’s an abusive sociopath! Surprise!"
Genius of the Modern World,"So he hasn't been involved in the show's writing room since season 2.

That's weird, everyone at /r/rickandmorty kept saying how essential he is to the future of the series."
Genius of the Modern World,"I’ve suspected that the writers have long detected red flags with Roiland.

While these companies are free to work with anyone he and to a degree Harmon seem to be the type of people you should probably have a “parted ways” statement on standby."
Genius of the Modern World,How is this a surprise. He’s a POS and said some really weird stuff to minor girls through DMs. Doesn’t help how unfunny he is either; always the same stupid voice
Genius of the Modern World,"How brave of these colleagues to speak up now after the crimes have been made public and their comments don’t impact their own ability to make money. 

True heroes."
Genius of the Modern World,But no one  still listens to Chris Brown right??
Genius of the Modern World,"Justin Roiland's contributions weren't even really to writing. His idea of writing is just making up characters with silly names like ""Shploobie Bibbles"" and juvenile gross-out humor. 2 of his 5 writing credits over 6 seasons of R&M were inter dimensional cable, which we all know is largely improvised, and see my point above about Shploobie Bibbles. New voice for the titular characters will be the biggest change, and I doubt very many reasonable people will end up giving a fuck."
Genius of the Modern World,His behavior was troubling in public.  I listened to one episode of his podcast and felt like my soul needed a powerwashing afterwords.
Genius of the Modern World,Thumbnail at a glance makes him look like a bad Sonic the Hedgehog OC.
Genius of the Modern World,Lol I saw him as sonic in the thumbnail instead of Rick and was very confused
Genius of the Modern World,So all the people freaking out about Roiland's involvement blew it way out of the proportion outside or doing voices
Genius of the Modern World,But Elon Musk said he’s the heart of the show!
Genius of the Modern World,When did assholery become ok some might say. Others would say it’s always been. I’m sad for folks who he wronged. Feel stupid for finally getting to these shows and then this.
Genius of the Modern World,What a big dumb douchebaggy bag'a douche.
Genius of the Modern World,"&#x200B;

Holy shit, the [tiny RC car with a camera](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ii6XuM187Zo) on it is real"
Genius of the Modern World,"Amazingly well researched article. 

What a creepy fuck this Roiland turned out to be"
Genius of the Modern World,Next time they gonna say is that he started his own religion. Pigs are people.
Genius of the Modern World,"If story accurate, all he did was make himself easy to replace. Never a good idea in any job. His role was get the ball rolling and voice work. Like any exec producer really.  

This is different then why most of us thought which was he was neck deep in the day to day work of getting the shows made and so his voice (literal and figuratively) were a critical component. That clearly isn’t the case.

If you think all those Steven Spielberg producing credits was him rolling up his sleeves and getting to work, you lost your minds. His roll was to pitch it, get the money on board and then sit back, let everyone do the actual work and reap the benefits.

After that the actual creatives did the heavy lifting of the writing, directing, animating while Roiland just did voice work from comfort of home. Not saying voice actors are not important, but unlike some live action shows, they can be replaced as there are many that can mimic the voice.

As for his silence, well duh. Even a first year law student will tell you to “shut the f—- up” when involved in criminal and civil cases. The worse thing he can do is say anything. Look at Adam Baldwin and his ill advised interview and how that is going to be used against him."
Genius of the Modern World,"For a man who created Rick Sanchez, I'll say it again, I'm not that surprised."
Genius of the Modern World,"Ahh yes, Hollywood reporter, they’re not bias or clickbaity."
Genius of the Modern World,"It really sounds like roiland just kept being himself and the success made everyone else be more cautious and that just didnt vibe with the “we are successful now so we must change” turn everyone took

You know, excluding the abuse stuff which is obviously terrible"
Genius of the Modern World,Whoda thought that the alcoholic who disguises hedonism as “complex” nihilism is actually an annoying and crass human being.
Genius of the Modern World,Incoming netflix docuseries
Genius of the Modern World,Yoga
Genius of the Modern World,How is everyone in this comment section ignoring the fact that he's a huge pedo? That news is definitely what resulted in adult swim cutting ties.
Genius of the Modern World,"so basically, everything was fine as long as he brought them fame and power? yeh, sounds bout right."
Genius of the Modern World,Roiland trying to be Rick in real life.
Genius of the Modern World,When I first saw Rick and Morty I thought it was funny. When I saw that everything he has ever done is the same damn voice and humor I found him way less funny.
Genius of the Modern World,It’s always guys like Roiland that try to get their reports to join them for a threesome. 🤢
Genius of the Modern World,"An episode aired last night with the toxic versions of Rick and Morty and it never occurred to me that Morty seduced two grown ass women, until just then. Never really put much thought into some of the shit that happens in the show until this stuff started coming out."
Genius of the Modern World,"I really like Solar Opposites, more than R and M. It’s a shame celebrities turn into raging douche canoes when they get a little money in the bank"
Dark Net,"Yes its a very entertaining documentary type show and each episode is only 30 mins so its easily digestable.

Its not really a bogeyman-scare-you-from-shit thing.

Highly recommended."
Dark Net,"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darknet_(TV_series)

This Dark Net is a solid little horror series.  

Kind of like ghost stories for the information age. 

Not creepy pasta.

Urban legend style stuff.  

Certainly not the intellectual heights of Black Mirror but if you like a cool twist and/or shock its up your alley.  "
Dark Net,do you have any idea where i could watch it?it's not on netflix in my country and can't find it for the life of me anywhere.a pm would be highly appreciated
Dark Net,Can this also be on firefox pls?
Dark Net,That service is legit amazing.
Dark Net,Wonder if it shows Pete & Pete?
Dark Net,"It has a Wipeout channel, an MST3K channel, and some cool Lucha Libre and other wresting channels.

The commercials suck, but the app is really good!"
Dark Net,I love Pluto tv and that channel.
Dark Net,What's pluto TV?
Dark Net,This is my favorite channel on Pluto and it’s not even close. A lot of the other channels admittedly repeat their programming a lot. Nick is the only one that I think Viacom/Pluto have an endless catalog to work with
Dark Net,Pluto TV used to have a 24 hour non-stop stream of R. Kelly’s “Trapped in the Closet” saga. My roommate and I spent an entire evening watching the whole thing while drinking Manischewitz.
Dark Net,"Pluto TV has come a long way, used to be pretty much free web content but now is a legit service. In addition to the Nick stuff they have a great channel which shows live concerts and music documentaries 24/7, the crazy addictive 4K channel,  as well as a growing streamable library"
Dark Net,Are the commercials still improperly cutting into the programming?
Dark Net,"For any Canadians reading this thread: Don't.

The 20 channels out of the hundreds that we can actually view, aren't really worth it unless if you're bored :("
Dark Net,24/7 mystery science theater too
Dark Net,"So much nostalgia! I was watching Punk'd, All That, Kenan and Kel. If they had Viva La Bam I would be in heaven."
Dark Net,Isn't the issue with these channels that the quantity of episodes they have of each show fairly limited?  I've read complaints of people saying they see the same show repeated a lot.
Dark Net,"If it has commercials, does it at least play that Sears air conditioner commercial?"
Dark Net,"PlutoTV was one of the first apps I downloaded on my TV.. there are new channels being added all the time. The On-Demand feature is amazing as well.

Watched ""Are You Afraid of the Dark"" last night. Now that I'm in my mid 30's I wondered why the hell I thought it was so scary back then..

I'm still waiting for ""Weinerville"" to be added to the Nickelodeon lineup on Pluto lol"
Dark Net,I love the classic Doctor Who channel
Dark Net,Another app called TubiTv lets you watch shows and movies with ads for free. You can find some good stuff there.
Dark Net,There is a channel that shows nothing but first person train rides thru europe. It’s pretty relaxing and I got way to excited when the train went by a town
Dark Net,There's also a doctor who channel that just plays doctor who episodes including classic
Dark Net,"My laptop broke, anyone know if there’s an Xbox app?"
Dark Net,Sweet what channel is the Nick stuff on?
Dark Net,"We leave our TV on for the dogs while at work, and that's the channel we have it set to. Although it tends to repeat because Keenan has choked on a screw in his tuna 3 times last week"
Dark Net,"Pluto TV is legit, movies tv shows documentries no are you still watching prompts.  Just added a bunch of channels too, has come a long way since it launched with the pot channel and a few others."
Dark Net,"seriously, who is watching the Wahlburgers channel?"
Dark Net,"I need to get my hands somehow on old cartoon network cartoons, any ideas?"
Dark Net,"I've always felt it would be interesting to have, say, a broadcast ""channel"" (stream) that pretends it's a notable TV channel from a notable era.  Not just the programming but every second of the broadcast, so commercials and whatnot.  MTV from the 80s and the _Beavis and Butthead_ era.  Cartoon Network during the best seasons of _Space Ghost Coast to Coast._  The Discovery Channel from when it showed educational programming."
Dark Net,"I love you for telling about this. My mom wants to get cable tv, purely for nostalgia, which is nice and all but it’s hella expensive."
Dark Net,Am I the only one that stopped Pluto TV because it had so many commercials that it derailed every show? I don’t get the praise.
Dark Net,free ?
Dark Net,Pluto TV is awesome.
Dark Net,"My biggest complaint about it is that it's the same ads being played between shows and it gets really annoying having to hear the same crap over and over again. In the case of SpongeBob, don't think i've ever seen any episode beyond Season 1 being played but maybe that's just me."
Dark Net,Channel of old school Who too!
Dark Net,"I heard of Pluto TV on the Harmontown podcast, and ever since I've been hooked.  I was shocked at the selection of movies that could be streamed and with their livetv offerings.  I have a slingTV subscription and I'm seriously considering cancelling it because Pluto offers content thats just as good, but for free.  The only real reason to keep sling at this point it to watch new episodes the night they air."
Dark Net,Firmly grasp it in your hand.
Dark Net,Firmly grasp it in your hand.
Dark Net,Are there any similar apps for LG Smart TVs? The content store doesn't have Pluto or Tubi. :(
Dark Net,They have Nick Jr too
Dark Net,"Does anyone else have problems with the app? Mine is very buggy and will freeze after commercials, or sometimes when switching channels. I wish this wasn't the case because it's an otherwise awesome service.

I have a Samsung btw."
Dark Net,"Thank you for letting me know of this platform sir, have my upvote 👍"
Dark Net,"it’s free, and that’s a great price.  thanks vizio.  very cool."

Dark Net,ITT: Youth of today reinvent broadcast TV circa 1955.
Dark Net,"Agreed an awesome service! Love watching some old survivor man eps!

However it’s very surprising to see an entire channel dedicated to dog the bounty hunter. Is there that big of a need and what advertisers are like yep that’s where we need to be."
Dark Net,Can't believe I scrolled everywhere in this thread and still no link to this channel. Anyways looks it doesn't exist outside the US.
Dark Net,"Yes, It's a great service overall. After the deal with Viacom and DirecTV flopped, rights to broadcast shows on Viacom-owned networks (and the networks themselves) were bought by Pluto TV."
Dark Net,Awesome recommendation. Thank you.
Dark Net,chromecast support?
Dark Net,"Thanks for this, i just set it up. Fairy odd parents is on! This would be great for kids."
Dark Net,Won't work in India unless you use a vpn
Dark Net,"Well, I know what I'm doing right now."
Dark Net,I watched it for 7 hours this weekend
Dark Net,Anyone remember the name of the website that used to stream all old nick shows with old commercials in between? That was my shit.
Dark Net,"Their commercials are annoying.

Edit: word"
Dark Net,"In for some Double Dare, GUTS, and Legends of the Hidden Temple."
Dark Net,FIRMLY GRASP IT!
Dark Net,Is this new? I've had pluto on my Roku and don't ever remember seeing that on there.
Dark Net,"Doesnt seem to be in the UK

Is it US only?"
Dark Net,thanks
Dark Net,Also has MST3000 channel.
Dark Net,"I got the Pluto app like 3 weeks ago based on another comment about a free classic doctor who channel, it casts to my Chromecast and I have been surfing free content on it non stop.  It’s one of the first places I have found streamable reruns of @midnight as just one highlight of the shows I have found.  Last night I watched an hour of zack Morris is trash which brought a whole new view of saved by the bell.   Pluto 9/10 would recommend.  Commercial breaks and stream loading issues are the only things keeping off of a perfect 10"
Dark Net,I didn’t know about Pluto tv until now. Just downloaded it and holy crap thank you. Fired it up straight to a channel guide
Dark Net,I just finished watching ripped pants on pluto.
Dark Net,"Oh nice! I'm sick at home at the moment, I will definitely check it out tomorrow. Sounds like something I could need in my life right now."
Dark Net,MST3K too. There are commercials but it's free.
Dark Net,"Check out the private Roku channel ""Toonami Aftermath"". They have a stream on there called ""Snickelodeon"" that's amazing."
Dark Net,Just looked it up. Oh my god a forensic files channel? Wtf i love this now.
Dark Net,"I keep trying to catch Doctor Who, but I never catch the beginning of a serial."
Dark Net,[removed]
Dark Net,"I need to see if my Samsung 32"" will have this available.  


I need my dose of the live actions, especially All That."
Dark Net,And they just launched an Android and Fire TV app.
Dark Net,Legit the hidden gem of streaming services....
Dark Net,"How do we use it? I feel like this is a post where somebody is like ""Comcast has FXX"". Yeah?"
Dark Net,"They need an Xbox and Playstation app (or at least, last time I checked neither had one)."
Dark Net,I love this app!
Dark Net,Im sold.
Dark Net,#FIRMLY GRASP IT
Dark Net,Which channel is it on?
Dark Net,they also have fox sports 1
Dark Net,What's it called?
Dark Net,The website Toonamiaftermath.com is pretty awesome too.
Dark Net,"Channel number?

EDIT: 711"
Dark Net,I think I just stepped into a viral marketing campaign but I dunno cuz I do like me some nostalgia.
Dark Net,If they have Rugrats and Hey Arnold I’m in!
Dark Net,"I glanced at pluto a couple times but didn't watch anything until last night- The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai Across the 8th Dimension!

&#x200B;

I feel like Pluto needs [The Ocho](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLr0v9MyGgM)."
Dark Net,Not crazy about the vape commercials on the Doctor Who channel.
Dark Net,Check out Amazon Prime's selection of old Nickelodeon shows. It's pretty big the last time I checked.
Dark Net,"Pluto TV still going, and with actual shows?  Damn I remember when it was just streaming old internet videos 24/7"
Dark Net,Which channel number is it???
Dark Net,"Man, I had shit to do today and now none of that is getting done because I'm watching Hey, Arnold and honestly I'm a little salty about it. Haha, but seriously thanks for this, this is amazing."
Dark Net,Can someone tell me the channel name? I'm not finding it at all.
Dark Net,I'd honestly just rather them be on a streaming service(legally)
Dark Net,"They also have a channel that pretty much shows all the classic travel channel shows - No Reservations, Man V Food, Samantha Brown. It's become my background television channel."
Dark Net,I wish Netflix had a plutotv type service with curated channels of their content.
Dark Net,Does it include The Adventures of Pete and Pete?
Dark Net,"Another good series on Pluto TV on demand is ""Fatal Attractions"" about people who got killed by their exotic animals.  It's free to watch and doesn't have commercials."
Dark Net,Who remembers the skinamax model channels on pluto?  There were just girls dressed in school outfits looking at the camara for 24 hours.  Then there was the train channel that would just show you a train ride for 24 hours. And the 24 hour snowboard.... I miss the old pluto :)
Close Your Eyes Before Itâ€™s Dark,"Damn, Alex Garland was way more political than I expected considering how apolitical his directed works seem. Even Devs had a chance to take a larger focus on the politicization of the ""tech giant"" a-la Zuckerberg, Musk, etc. and mostly left that on the side to focus on the scientific and philosophical aspects of the narrative which have been his wheelhouse now for a while.

I actually think he wrote that part of the show very poorly, so I don't know how I feel about him saying in this that he was writing something about civil disobedience."
Close Your Eyes Before Itâ€™s Dark,"I agree, first 4-5 seasons were excellent. After that, it felt like they needed to keep increasing the intensity and made questionable decisions. This happens to many of these shows. 

The procedurals like Grey's Anatomy, NCIS, etc have it easier."
Close Your Eyes Before Itâ€™s Dark,"I watched every single episode of this series until the end. To me, it started to go downhill the Leviathan season and what they did to my Bobby Singer. I'm loyal, but I'm honest. There were ups and downs after season 5, but truly, the worst thing they could have done was what they did to Bobby. Ingents."
Close Your Eyes Before Itâ€™s Dark,"Yup. But I personally wouldn't have wanted it cancelled at season 5, cause we had some really banger episodes in later seasons (weekend at Bobby's comes to mind)  
 
So now whenever I do rewatches I go straight through 1-5, then start skipping around to the good stuff for the rest"
Close Your Eyes Before Itâ€™s Dark,"The problem with the show in the later seasons is definitely the over reliance on goofy characters. In previous seasons, demons and angels were considered a threat and could be imposing. Then in the later seasons, they become ineffectual comic relief. Every side character becomes a goofy caricature with an over the top accent. The people they meet are cartoons for the most part and the acting is terrible. Sam and Dean also become a bit goofy as well, especially Sam, who’s acting method seems to be simply a large variety of facial ticks and stuttering grunts. Jensen Ackles has too much charisma to be too bad, he’s always watchable but for the most part he becomes a goofy guy as well. The beginning seasons have comedic moments that are pretty good and used sparingly, but they really lean into it in the later seasons and lose all the horror that the early seasons had."
Close Your Eyes Before Itâ€™s Dark,Yes. I truly pretend season 6-15 never existed and just appreciate seasons 1-5 for what they are. It’s a great five season arc.
Close Your Eyes Before Itâ€™s Dark,"I was kind of obsessed at the time, and really worried they would cancell it before the planned ending on season 5. 

Although, looking back, I think the introduction of angels took a lot of the original charm, it was really good TV"
Close Your Eyes Before Itâ€™s Dark,"I definitely grew to miss that really dark aesthetic of the early seasons. I remember a later episode where they're with Rowena rounding up souls in this suburban Canadian neighborhood and it was *so bright* outside. Like distractingly so. 

(It was also one of the few episodes that was very obviously in Canada because the street signs were unlike any I'd seen in the US. But I digress)"
Close Your Eyes Before Itâ€™s Dark,"They jumped so many sharks, they had to reuse sharks."
Close Your Eyes Before Itâ€™s Dark,"The first season is rough. I love it, I have seen it several times, I can watch any episode but the first season is rough. Like Stargate SG-1 it takes time until it becomes a diamond."
Close Your Eyes Before Itâ€™s Dark,"You are correct and there is a clear reason for all of what you said: Kripke only planned the series to be 5 seasons. This is why people call the season 5 finale the “original ending”. But with Supernatural being CW’s most successful show, CW wanted the show to continue. Kripke obliged but he also stepped down as showrunner, and other people took over running the show post season 5. So seasons 6-15 is basically just repetitive season arc’s of fan service, whereas seasons 1-5 had a serialized story that all tied together. The only good thing to come out of seasons 6-15 is >!the confirmation that Chuck is God!<, a lot of fans theorized it before, but if the show had ended after season 5 we never would’ve known for sure."
Close Your Eyes Before Itâ€™s Dark,"It's a good example of how to transition from ""case of the week"" to overarching storyline in a seamless and exciting way. Still a B-show at best for me, but it was fun when I was a teenager! I never continued after season 5."
Close Your Eyes Before Itâ€™s Dark,"With these long-running shows that went downhill in the end it can sometimes be easy to forget there was a time when they were excellent, and that's why they ran long in the first place. Looking at you Arrow."
Close Your Eyes Before Itâ€™s Dark,I hate how they literally wrote in plot armor for them into the series.  It cheapened the whole series.
Close Your Eyes Before Itâ€™s Dark,The series originally was only planned for 5 seasons.
Close Your Eyes Before Itâ€™s Dark,"I always wish it had been cancelled after 5. It would have gone down as a great show, not hokey fan service. And maybe Jared wouldn’t have become so unbearable."
Close Your Eyes Before Itâ€™s Dark,I know people love this show I just don't see it.
Close Your Eyes Before Itâ€™s Dark,"I'm going through Supernatural now for the first time and I'm halfway through season 7 at the moment. I actually think season 6 is a contender for my favourite. Even though it's clear they juggled several plots that they struggled to interconnect, it has several of my favourite episodes of the whole shows, less Sam and Dean conflict (which was played out by that point anyway) and the best part: more Bobby. Bobby is far and away the best character in Supernatural, so having more of him was only a good thing. Season 7 is a noticeable downgrade.

There's a lot of season 1 and 2 that feels very simple, which is to be expected when you're starting a new show and building up a mythology. It's like early episodes of Buffy or The X-Files (and probably a dozen other shows), with the monster of the week format and finding out how to kill them. Kind of like a police procedural but with monsters. When they start to delve into heaven and hell, then I think it starts to hit its stride (Kurt Fuller is great). I'm a lot less interested when it's just constant brother drama.

The problem is that I don't really care about Sam and Dean (*especially* Dean) but some of the side characters are great. So far, I think the episodes and seasons focused on Bobby and Castiel are some of the best ones (which is why I like season 6 so much) and it's disappointing they didn't make the most of Ellen, Jo, Ash, Rufus and more."
Close Your Eyes Before Itâ€™s Dark,"Is it ""extremely good""? Or is it ""extremely good for a CW show""? There's a big difference. I remember this sub telling me *The Arrow* was 'extremely good', which caused all confidence in that channel to be lost."
Close Your Eyes Before Itâ€™s Dark,"More than 10 years since I watched those first 5 seasons and it's still a top favorite of mine.

Somewhere around season 10 was when I stopped watching it weekly. I caught up whenever I had a couple of episodes to binge. After 11 I didn't want to continue anymore. I started a rewatch during that hiatus and I was shocked to finally notice how far the quality had dropped with those later seasons.

After that I came across youtube clips here and there so I have a general idea what the last 4 seasons were like. I did watch the season 15 penultimate episode though and it was just complete garbage. The cgi was so bad the show looked like shit. It looked much better in the earlier seasons. And that was 15 years earlier!

I still watch Kripke's run every other year or so."
Close Your Eyes Before Itâ€™s Dark,Agreed. The story was told by the end of Season 5. Personally I hated the angels and especially Castiel who was played by an extremely bad actor. He was okay in 4 and 5 but anything after that involving him or the angels was tedious to get through. It was so clearly not working anymore that they wrote him out at one point but ended up bringing him back because of the backlash from (I presume) viewers who thought he was hot.  Sam was a bad actor too but the chemistry with Dean helped offset his bad acting even though I think he actually got worse as the show went on. Supernatural was a great show for the first 5 seasons but the other seasons and focus on Castiel tarnished it.
Close Your Eyes Before Itâ€™s Dark,"Yeah, there's a lot of good stories that could be told post-Season 5, but the post-Season 5 we got usually just did the worst possible version of each of those stories. Case in point, how do you go bigger than the devil? You could go with the living embodiment of chaos, the Leviathan. And post-Season 5 of Supernatural did that! ...But it wasn't just the one Leviathan, it was multiple leviathans, and they had nothing to do with the chaos dragon of lore or any sort of leviathan mythos really, instead just being virtually immortal versions of an enemy the brothers have already fought multiple times.

What gets me though is that Kripke was still writing on the show in Season 6. Yes, he was no longer the head writer, but he was still consulting, directly writing a couple of episodes, and was apparently okay with all of the lore inconsistencies and plot holes that Season 6 produced (unless he only had knowledge about the episodes he was working on and not any of the others).

Because of that and the low points of the Carver era, I think I would still be skeptical of a post-S5 new Kripke era even though those first five seasons were amazing."
Close Your Eyes Before Itâ€™s Dark,"While I agree that 1-5 amazing, there were a few standalone seasons that were also very good. I think it's season 11 where they are trying to stop Gods sister, and that was a banger. A redeemed Metatron trying to convince Chuck not to give up on humanity is peak Supernatural.

Of course, then they completely ruin that excellence with the plot twist involving God in the last season.

I think the show had two perfect series finales, S5 and S11. The actual finale got ruined by COVID, so I'd cut them some slack if the rest of the season wasn't terrible."
Close Your Eyes Before Itâ€™s Dark,"Money is a helluva drug. 

I pretty much tell anyone interested in the show “watch seasons 1 through 5, pause the last episode of season 5 at the end right when the camera is outside of the house, and pretend that’s where the series ended and 6-15 aren’t real.”"
Close Your Eyes Before Itâ€™s Dark,Is it just me who feels supernatural and Smallville are bizarrely similar in later seasons??
Close Your Eyes Before Itâ€™s Dark,"I would hardly call ""extremely good"", it was alright

the show was always B tier/CW silliness, especially after season 1"
Close Your Eyes Before Itâ€™s Dark,"Extremely good?  I mean come on.  They are OK.  Its a good thing to have on in the background while you're doing something else.  Its B level quantity over quality television, which is fine.  There's nothing really outstanding about it.  Its entertaining enough, but the writing, acting, cinematography, are all pretty meh."
Close Your Eyes Before Itâ€™s Dark,"It's difficult to recommend people to just watch 5 seasons out of a 15 season show on good faith. Yet new people will get a bit afraid seeing a 15 season show to pick up, specially one with so many episodes.

Loved those first 5 seasons and the whole 15 were good overall but gee, makes it difficult to recommend the show."
Close Your Eyes Before Itâ€™s Dark,"It's actually 2 - 5.  Originally, the brothers weren't meant to continue.  It was going to be a anthology series at first. Their chemistry on screen is what made them stop telling a story about the world with these characters in it, and more about these characters interacting with the world.  Also the budget significantly increases in the second season.  If you watch the end of Season 1, it ends with a car crash with generic ass music playing on the radio.  Season 2 starts and its playing a licensed Ted Nugent song."
Close Your Eyes Before Itâ€™s Dark,"It's a good YA show, but it doesn't hold up against other top TV shows. 

Swap Jensen Ackles and Jared Padalecki out for less attractive leads and the show loses a large portion of its female fanbase."
Close Your Eyes Before Itâ€™s Dark,Wasn't Ben Edlund responsible for the show's uptick (ha!) In quality on seasons 2-5?
Close Your Eyes Before Itâ€™s Dark,"There are a lot of good episodes in seasons 1-2, but I’ve always felt like the writers strike forcing a shorter season 3 was hugely beneficial. Made them cut out any filler and focus more on the larger plot.

Season 3 also gave us Ghostfacers, so on that alone it’s my favorite."
Close Your Eyes Before Itâ€™s Dark,"Some good with a lot of meh is a perfect description of the seasons post Lucifer prophecy aka season 6 and onward. I honestly enjoy the over arcing narratives of each season, but wow are there a lot of 'skip' moments in each season/episode. Basically any time Sam and Dean start arguing and then later make up became instant skip scenes. At that point they served no narrative purpose beyond starting and episode with drama and ending the episode with a flimsy disagreement conclusion that set them back to their basic positions. 


As a side note, im still annoyed with how they built up Eve, made super monsters, and then just brushed it all away in about 5 minutes of scene time.


While I personally didnt like the final confrontation, I was fine with the finale/ send-off. But yes the first 5 seasons are quite good and season 5 is one that I occasionally go back to and watch again. Mark Pellegrino was a fantastic Lucifer for the earlier seasons."
Close Your Eyes Before Itâ€™s Dark,I think there was a drop in quality after Eric Kripke left the show
Close Your Eyes Before Itâ€™s Dark,"Just finished a full series rewatch myself and I was thinking the same thing about the back ten seasons, but at the same time I really respect them just for going for it yknow?

A lot of people say they hated the Leviathans but honestly that whole ""arc"" for lack of a better term is probably my favorite just because it was amazing to me that they actually managed to find a new villain after the massive shark jump that was lucifer

And although it started to get stale after awhile everytime they managed to pull a new bad guy out of their asses I was honestly floored

Like when Dean massacred the house of frankstein that was pretty dumb, and when there was that one episode about the monster families that run Chicago that never came up again, I was rolling my eyes at that pretty hard but just the charm of jumping the shark and then finding a larger shark to jump over never wore off on me"
Close Your Eyes Before Itâ€™s Dark,"I put the writing of 1-5 of supernatural against any TV show, and it holds up.

I look at it as 6-15 is just a different show. 1-5 takes itself reasonably seriously, 6-15 is fun popcorn television."
Close Your Eyes Before Itâ€™s Dark,"I think the only season I skipped in full was season 10. My least favourite choice in the show will always be the dragon copout, too."
Close Your Eyes Before Itâ€™s Dark,"First 2 seasons were close to x-files ""monster of the week"". Then when we got close to the characters they added epic story."
Close Your Eyes Before Itâ€™s Dark,End last ep of season 5 as it starts to pan away from Dean having a meal with his adopted family and it's perfect.
Close Your Eyes Before Itâ€™s Dark,Dean telling Sam what he did while he was in hell is one of the best scenes in TV
Close Your Eyes Before Itâ€™s Dark,"Agreed... and disagreed. As much as I love SPN season 1-5, I wouldn't say I like how the female characters in it were written. Save Bela. Bela was fucking awesome.

Then again I also don't like how the female characters are written in 6-15 so... Yeah, I really don't know how to feel about the whole show regarding that."
Close Your Eyes Before Itâ€™s Dark,"I do agree season 1-5 are the best the show has I really liked season 6-11 and imo season 11 works as a series finale too.

12-15 while weaker I still liked them I thought god as the villian was cool but he didn't really do much in season 15 the whole bringing back old creatures was dealt with swiftly.

granted God being evil was abit left field 

the show finale while not the best I still enjoyed it"
Close Your Eyes Before Itâ€™s Dark,"Yeah Power creep, they beat the devil so the next baddie has to be more powerful, and then the next one, etc.

I still enjoy the later seasons for the monster-of-the-week episodes but almost all of the plotlines are weak."
Close Your Eyes Before Itâ€™s Dark,"I used to go on the subreddit and speculate how certain seasons would wind up, and I was always wrong because they would just keep getting more and more ridiculous and then a bigger enemy would emerge in the last episode and one of the brothers would disappear. That show had so much potential for good stories but it became fanservice schlock."
Close Your Eyes Before Itâ€™s Dark,"Near the end of the leviathan stuff is when I stopped, good to know I didn't miss out on anything."
Close Your Eyes Before Itâ€™s Dark,And then they brought Bobby back! Not the same Bobby but still! I’m guessing they got a lot of backlash killing Bobby off (and the way they did it) and found a way to bring him back and thought everything would be square lol
Close Your Eyes Before Itâ€™s Dark,"''The French Mistake'', ''Baby'' and ''ScoobyNatural''. Fantastic episodes."
Close Your Eyes Before Itâ€™s Dark,Seasons 1-5 are the Winchester Gospel. Seasons 6-15 are the apocrypha.
Close Your Eyes Before Itâ€™s Dark,"I actually didn't finish season 15. I got halfway through and gave up when I heard the ending had been horrible. I read the synopsis of the remaining episodes and it was just a weird way to end it. Having rewatched 1-5, it makes way more sense to stop there and pretend it actually ended there."
Close Your Eyes Before Itâ€™s Dark,And one episode was called jump the shark.
Close Your Eyes Before Itâ€™s Dark,"The problem with season one on streaming is that it’s the only season without the original music used in the show. So you’ll have moments of Dean rocking out to a rock song, but it’s the not the song that was originally in the show so they have to edit it weird."
Close Your Eyes Before Itâ€™s Dark,"After a quick scroll on IMDB i'll give you Bloody Mary, Hook Man, Bugs and Route 666 but I think the rest are watchable to great, even something like The Benders sets up the trope of human enemies always being gross bastards. 18 outta 22 ain't bad."
Close Your Eyes Before Itâ€™s Dark,Yeah it took a while for them to figure out the right balance of monster of the week with serialized story. As a whole it's good but you can pick it apart pretty easily episode by episode and ultimately the monster of the week stuff just falls short. The real redeeming factor of the show was that serialized story and you sat through the monster of the week to see the weekly 5 minutes of progression for the overarching plot.
Close Your Eyes Before Itâ€™s Dark,"We went to a Supernatural fan panel at a convention. It was our first con and we thought it would be fun. I forget how my husband ended up with the mic, but he said, well we all know Chuck is God. 

Holy crap was the response not what I expected. Half the room cheered in agreement, the other half grumbled and there were a few boos. One of the panelists wanted to know what led him to believe that. It was obvious she disagreed, and a guy in the audience went on about how how was a Christian and Chuck being God would be disrespectful to Christianity. All I could think was, do you even watch the show?

It was realty wild to see so many people refuse to believe it, and then the big reveal happened. I really liked Chuck being God. Everything after with his character was uneven to downright disappointing."
Close Your Eyes Before Itâ€™s Dark,The powerhouse they had at Thursday night I believe with Smallville leading into Supernatural made them a ton of money. It’s not surprising they would milk it even after the creators were out of story.
Close Your Eyes Before Itâ€™s Dark,"And that is why they were the best seasons. Still one of the greatest shows in years in terms of music and art direction. 

I get so angry about the Sera Gamble seasons. Big bad talked about in first couple episodes then forgotten and defeated in the last 1-2 episodes. 

Carver wasn't too bad. 

I popped back for the Men of Letters season when Mary was brought back.

Edit to add: I feel bad for everyone who watched it later via streaming after the original music was stripped out. The classic rock used went with the story in most cases and when it was switched it didn't feel the same. I can only watch it on bluray at this point otherwise there is much rage."
Close Your Eyes Before Itâ€™s Dark,"Honestly i disagree. While it obviously went downhill after season 5 we still got some amazing and fun episodes along the way up to season 15 that we would have missed. Like my all time favorite one ""The French Mistake"" in season 6. Just that episode alone makes Season 6 worth watching."
Close Your Eyes Before Itâ€™s Dark,"Extremely good for a network TV show, not just CW. If you have issues with network TV, those issues are still present. If you don't, it's a fantastic time."
Close Your Eyes Before Itâ€™s Dark,"You have a point, but I personally think it's just a solid show for any network (specifically season 1-5). There is a super cringe part of the fandom that overlaps with The Arrow fans that think that stuff was good. I gave The Arrow a shot after hearing the accolades and it was the most meh piece of TV. The latter years of SPN catered extremely hard to these cringe fans (where the early seasons actually made fun of them). I honestly think Twitter/Tumbler fandoms have ruined many shows because a show gets popular so creators turn to the internet to see what the fans are saying and the most hardcore ones are living there creating the absolute dumbest piece of fanfic possible with everyone praising it. 

The WB/CW was a good melodrama network for teens and young adults and then it turned into PG13 Nickelodeon shows."
Close Your Eyes Before Itâ€™s Dark,"I think post-5 Kripke was collecting checks and helping the team transition without him. I mean they literally kill him in one episode. After that, he seemed to just get residuals and drop in every now and then. The writing was just terrible after he left though. I know he didn't personally write that many episodes in 1-5, but his showrunning direction must have been what kept things grounded and on a consistent course. 

He seems to be running the Boys like he did SPN and I think that's making people anxious. A big criticism of The Boys season 3 is that it ended just like it started and nothing really changed, just a lot of build up for nothing. To me that's exactly what happened in season 3 of SPN with Dean actually dying and going to hell. He seems to still write like he would for a network TV show instead of a streaming service, and he's said that he's planning to go to season 5 with the Boys. I think he's got good ideas and knows how to string stories along to keep them interesting until they can reach a final episode and come to a conclusion. I'd bet he'd be able to develop a well rounded epilogue to season 5 SPN if he got the chance."
Close Your Eyes Before Itâ€™s Dark,"For me the only stand-out late season was 12, when the villains went from being angels and demons to just… the English. Such a weird choice but I enjoyed the change."
Close Your Eyes Before Itâ€™s Dark,1000%
Close Your Eyes Before Itâ€™s Dark,Probably cuz they reuse the same local Canadian actors.
Close Your Eyes Before Itâ€™s Dark,"You gotta treat it like I did Arrow. It was a shame they canceled it after 2 seasons. I still have such rage over black canary in s3e1.

It's such a shame SPN got canceled after 5 seasons."
Close Your Eyes Before Itâ€™s Dark,"You just have to explain to the people that you're recommending the show to that it's not really a 15 season show. It's more like a 5 season show with a 6 season sequel show which has its own 4 season sequel show. And the sequel shows just retained the title of the original show. But you can jump off at the end of Season 5, the end of Season 11, or the end of Season 15 and still get a full story."
Close Your Eyes Before Itâ€™s Dark,I wouldn't call Bad Moon Rising by CCR generic ass music.
Close Your Eyes Before Itâ€™s Dark,"I think the anthology series was an idea that got dropped before the pilot even shot. Kripke wanted the scary stories to be front and center with a couple of reporters going around capturing them, but when the studio disliked that he pitched the idea of them being brothers. I think he fleshed out a couple seasons at a time, waiting to see if they would be able to continue before writing any cliffhangers."
Close Your Eyes Before Itâ€™s Dark,"Maybe. I followed Padiwhack over from Gilmore Girls. Mainly, I was there for the monster of the week with the supernatural twists. Horror is my bread and butter. 

Even better was the classic rock music. So much good music in those early seasons."
Close Your Eyes Before Itâ€™s Dark,"Yea, and he stayed until season 8 but I think he worked better with Kripke there than when he wasn't."
Close Your Eyes Before Itâ€™s Dark,"OMFG, I swear it's because Sera Gamble forgot who her big bad for that season was. So much potential just forgotten."
Close Your Eyes Before Itâ€™s Dark,"I've never really understood this criticism about the female characters. I understand that many times there was a ""damsel in distress"" type character week to week that Dean usually hit on (especially in the early episodes), but they never seemed purposefully written to be a bad stereotype and his advances were usually batted down and he was made to look like a fool.

Jo and Ellen showed up early in the series and appeared a number of times. Each time they held their own against the bad guys and all of the male characters seemed to respect them.

Ruby and Meg were both demons and did demon things and it never seemed like they were written poorly (just maybe acted poorly at times).

Sheriff Jody Mills helps defeat the bad guy after her family was killed.

Bela was well written and beat the guys quite a bit.

These were all season 5 and earlier characters. I think the overall issue is that there wasn't a prominent female character that lasted a long time. Most of them showed up every now and then, but not like Bobby, Crowley, and Castiel who were often in episode after episode. There's only so much room for the regular cast and they'd already settled into a very male-centric show. Two brothers + dad, then two brothers + Bobby, then two brothers + Bobby and a male angel, then two brothers + Bobby and a male angel and a male demon. They seemed to try to rectify this with Rowena and Mary later on, but those episodes were already meh. The crux of the matter is that the show started off as very hetero-focused with Dean being a womanizer. So any woman that was introduced was already being ogled at by one of the main characters. Dean even sleeps with an angel in one episode and Sam sleeps with a werewolf in another episode. The early seasons had women showing up who would eventually swoon for the main characters, except for the ones I listed above. So I think instead of bucking that trend, they just didn't put effort into casting a series regular woman in any role."
Close Your Eyes Before Itâ€™s Dark,"I loved the series throughout the entire run, but the power creep was pretty hilarious.

They kill literal death, and eventually they kill the actual omniscient omnipresent God, despite having no actual powers. 

Puts DBZ to shame."
Close Your Eyes Before Itâ€™s Dark,"Until eventually they literally killed Death, Lucifer, and even God. It got pretty silly (I still enjoyed the later seasons, but I also know they were ridiculous and not as good as the beginning)"
Close Your Eyes Before Itâ€™s Dark,"The extremely meta ""The French Mistake"" in Season 6 is one of the best episodes of a show taking the piss out of its actors, storylines, and fans. There's a reason those gifs are still used today."
Close Your Eyes Before Itâ€™s Dark,"Yeah, that's when I called it quits as well. The leviathans were hyped up so much, then were completely depowered by the end of the season. The first red flag was when they pulled that same shit with Castiel already."
Close Your Eyes Before Itâ€™s Dark,Just think; that's about half way through the series. Woof.
Close Your Eyes Before Itâ€™s Dark,"The single thing I recommend going back for is the Scooby-Doo crossover because it's a standalone.

No, seriously."
Close Your Eyes Before Itâ€™s Dark,"So much rage over what they did to Bobby.

Flames! Flames on the side of my face!"
Close Your Eyes Before Itâ€™s Dark,"I used to show friends who weren’t sure if they’d like the show 3 episodes: Mystery Spot, Ghostfacers, and French Mistake. Always a big hit."
Close Your Eyes Before Itâ€™s Dark,This is perfect. Love it.
Close Your Eyes Before Itâ€™s Dark,The season 5 ending is the highest rated episodes of the show. The season 15 one is the 3rd lowest out of all the 327 episodes lol.
Close Your Eyes Before Itâ€™s Dark,"I watched season 6, eventually. My husband watched every episode. Occasionally he would have me watch episodes that I would 'love' and he was mostly right - if I treated it like fan fiction and not canon. Scoobynatural was HIGHLY entertaining."
Close Your Eyes Before Itâ€™s Dark,I cried during the last episode. It seemed like the perfect sendoff to me. YMMV
Close Your Eyes Before Itâ€™s Dark,Bugs was the very first episode I watched haha
Close Your Eyes Before Itâ€™s Dark,Rob Benedict confirmed that Chuck is God back in 2011 at a convention. He even said that Kripke and other writers/producers asked him how it felt to play God.
Close Your Eyes Before Itâ€™s Dark,"Season 11 had Metatron call Chuck God's meatsuit and that the nebbishness of his personality belonged to Chuck, not God. To me that leaves the door open to either interpretation.

Either:

1) At the beginning of time God knew how everything in the future would play out, knew when the apocalypse would be triggered, and created his angels with the name of a ""prophet"" on the inside of their eyelids that he always knew he would disguise himself as one day. Then when it came time for that ""prophet"" to be born, he paused the prophet-creation mechanic so that no new prophet would be born during Chuck's lifetime, blinded the archangel who was assigned to watch Chuck so that he wouldn't see that God was letting himself be born as Chuck (or came into being as an adult Chuck and simply rewrote Raphael's memories so that he didn't realize he never watched Chuck being born and growing up). And then he pretended to have headaches to pass himself off as a prophet. Then after Raphael had died, he continued pretending to have headaches when no one was around to see him simply because he had gotten that into the character of Chuck. He then left Earth for a while and restarted the prophet-creation mechanic. Then he returned to Earth, had sex with some of his creations that he considers his children, eventually talked to Metatron, and through his conversation with Metatron decided that he wanted to be a writer who told the truth. So he helped the brothers defeat Amara (but possibly lied about Gabriel's death), and then left Earth with her for a while. Then he came back to Earth and decided he instead wanted to be a writer who lies in order to be the best writer of all time. He cooked up ways to torture the brothers, but even though he was able to foresee the apocalypse at the beginning of time, he couldn't foresee the brothers' plans to defeat him. And then the brothers left him alive even though he still has all of his knowledge of magic and powered-artifacts that would let him return as a threat in the future.

or

2) Chuck was an actual human prophet that was born to human parents. His name was written on the inside of the angels' eyelids from the beginning of time. He helped the brothers, and in the Season 5 finale God began using him as a vessel. God began taking on Chuck's memories as his own and pretending that Chuck's experiences were his experiences. When Metatron confronted him about this charade, he led God to the conclusion that he didn't want to be Chuck anymore, he wanted to be a writer who told the truth. So he helped the brothers defeat Amara and then merged with her at the end of Season 11. God's light softened Amara, allowing her to appreciate creation, but Amara's darkness corrupted Chuck, feeding his ego and narcissism, and allowed Chuck to gain control of God and his powers. So now instead of God pretending to be Chuck, it was Chuck pretending to be God. And Chuck had no qualms about being a writer who lies if it meant he would be recognized as the greatest writer ever. But because Chuck isn't God, he didn't have full access to all of God's powers. He wasn't able to see how the brothers would defeat him. And once he was defeated, he didn't have God's knowledge of magic or artifacts that would allow him to become a threat to the brothers ever again.

Personally I think the second option makes more sense and gives the story a better conclusion, but I think people are welcome to go with the first interpretation if they choose.

That said, Kripke confirmed that Chuck wasn't always planned to be God. They were still trying to figure out how they wanted to portray God when they were writing the back half of Season 5, and Kripke confirmed that God hadn't appeared in the show yet at that time even though Chuck had appeared in Season 4 and three episodes of Season 5."
Close Your Eyes Before Itâ€™s Dark,"Oh the catering to fans really killed Arrow for me. I ended up tapping out. 

And yeah. Becky hilarious.  The musical lame."

Close Your Eyes Before Itâ€™s Dark,"Okay, I don't know about you but I feel like you and I watched 2 different shows. Spoileeeers.

>Jo and Ellen showed up early in the series and appeared a number of times. Each time they held their own against the bad guys and all of the male characters seemed to respect them.


In what sort of ways do you say they held their own?

Jo's first appearance was good but she didn't face off against any bad guys. Jo's second appearance had her kidnapped before Dean and Sam save her. Then she agrees to use herself as bait while the our two heroes trap him in a ring of salt. Third appearance has Meg tie her up and continually harrass her before Dean saves her. The only thing she does in the episode is save him from drowning but that's about it. Fourth appearance has War making her think a demon entered her mother and finally, she shows some combat skills, but she doesn't end up using them against any bad guys. 

And finally, fifth appearance has her finally showing that she's all grown by... once again using herself as bait and Sam and Dean go to steal the colt back from Crowley. Now, she does end up saving Dean but she never manages to kill either of those two dogs, her mother did. She may have been the one who gave the idea of having them blow up the shop while Sam and Dean leave but that's way too late and it was while on her deathbed.

Jo's whole arc is that she wants her mother to see her as a full fledged hunter. As someone who can take care of herself without her mother needing to babying her. But we don't get any sort of acknowledgment from her.

Ellen isn't any better. Good first appearance but no bad guys. Second appearance has her decide to go with Bobby, Sam and Dean before Jake Tally decides to use her as a hostage make her turn her gun to her head. She's does end up helping Bobby close the gate of hell but that's about all she does in that episode. Third appeareance has her being held down by her own daughter and after she managed to overpower her, she runs back to storage and leaves Sam with Jo and Rufus.

 And then there's her final episode. She may have been the one to take out the dogs but it was too late.

>Ruby and Meg were both demons and did demon things and it never seemed like they were written poorly (just maybe acted poorly at times).

 I'm not so sure about that. Yes, they were fine. But when you compare them to someone like Crowley, especially Ruby, it becomes clear that they only had one goal in mind. They never seemed to be fleshed out like he was.

Meg 1 and Meg 2 were fine.

Speaking of the demoness(es?), one thing I've noticed is that whenever a(male) demon is shown to be tortured, that almost always have their clothes on and mostly shown bloody and beaten. However, when Ruby is held by Alastair, she is shown naked with only a metal bar covering her nipples, much is the same way with Meg.

Jody and Bella were fine, I guess.

Female (recurring) characters you have mentioned from kripke era:

>Becky

A caricature of an obsessive fangirl. There's nothing nice to say about her.

>Anna

Man, did she get shafted soooo badly. I'm fully well aware of her potential and that her role was taken by Castiel because he was the fan's favorite but if there's any female character that was poorly written, it's her.

There was a post on SPN subreddit that explained what was wrong with what they had done to her. Here it is.

https://www.reddit.com/r/Supernatural/comments/101mfyo/anna_was_done_so_wrong_on_this_show/

>Lisa

She is there to primarily suit Dean's needs after what happened to Sam. As opposed to all the other love interests, she is not fleshed out well enough. Main thing out her is that she has a son named Ben, who's probably Dean's, had a one night stand with Dean and that's about it. Heck, we're supposed to believe he fell in love with her but we barely know anything about her. 

I don't mind having love interests but the fact that they're there primarily to suit them, never having their own arcs and struggles and even if they did, they just  aren't as complex as the other recurring characters were at when they were at season 5(Cas to Anna, Crowley to Ruby and Meg).

And that would leave us with 1 good female character, 3 evil female characters. Of all those four, only one of them lived on and it wasn't a love interest. 

That's my problem. Love interests are shown from the first episode to either die from being involved with the Winchesters(John to Mary, Sam to Madison and Jessica and Dean to Anna(although that was more of Castiel's fault))

And if you want a much more egregious example look no further further the finale, Sam's love interest is never shown her face. The mother of his children shown out of the shot because... uhhh
Ummm..."
Close Your Eyes Before Itâ€™s Dark,[deleted]
Close Your Eyes Before Itâ€™s Dark,"It's so hammy and campy it's incredible imo. I loved when the show was more ""grounded"" but I equally love it for going so hard off the rails while being self aware and REALLY committing to it. 

What other show has done that?"
Close Your Eyes Before Itâ€™s Dark,">!And the end was a slap on the face - to have plot armor throughout the series to die a stupid death to a usual monster. Yeah, I know the meta story, but the point is, deaths are cheap stake - which is why action genre is considered low, whereas other stakes are harder to develop and pay off. And to use sudden character death in the last episode is terribly cheap!<"
Close Your Eyes Before Itâ€™s Dark,I liked how they depowered them in the last episode or 2 of  season15 but it felt like that could have come way earlier in the show to get them back to fighting more normal monsters.
Close Your Eyes Before Itâ€™s Dark,"Yes, but can the brothers defeat a nail in a wall?"
Close Your Eyes Before Itâ€™s Dark,"Hey, they were super powerful with a devastating weakness for … common household cleaners."
Close Your Eyes Before Itâ€™s Dark,Hey it’s Tuesday! Pig’n’poke!
Close Your Eyes Before Itâ€™s Dark,Yellow fever along with those 3 are some of my favorites
Close Your Eyes Before Itâ€™s Dark,"That's ridiculous, lol. Can you imagine a world where seasons 6-15 didn't exist? With SPN having ended 13 years ago and just been one of those shows that faded into maybe cult classic like status? Going out on the highest rated episode of the series would have been great and people probably would have been discussing a potential continuation for the past 13 years. That's when you get them back together and you pick up with a limited new story and the whole point is to finally get Sam out of hell. Instead, they brought him back before the episode ended."
Close Your Eyes Before Itâ€™s Dark,"And you didn’t quit there and then? I don’t think I would have been so strong, that episode is ROUGH."
Life plan A and B,"This show really missed the mark for me. Willow was a movie that Millennials grew up with but this was clearly geared to gen z who, I think, mostly don't care about the IP. Willow got sidelined as a character and the story felt like an incredibly generic YA fantasy plotline with Willow stamped on it. I had the same complaint about Wednesday but that at least kept the Tim Burton AF vibe through a lot of it, and who doesn't love Danny Elfman covering Metallica? Willow seemed to try too hard and then give up entirely. Watching Davis step back into the role was a treat but they... Fuck I'm not gonna say it.... Okay fuck it. They shortchanged him bad. And I say that with all respect to a living legend. His scenes, especially about his and Sorcha's history, were great. Everything else felt like Disney said ""How old could Millennials be? 10 years?"""
Life plan A and B,"I tried to do some research into viewership, and it was obviously not particularly conclusive, but certainly pointing towards lower viewership then required for a sequel series if the show didn't pick up a lot more viewers in later works. The bad word of mouth/user ratings probably didn't help.

https://medium.com/@plumresearch/willow-on-disney-b702a8874c74#"
Life plan A and B,"""Did he get EP?“

""He did.""

""Good for him!"""
Life plan A and B,"I think they really missed the mark with casting, script, and music selection. So many ridiculous lines, delivery, and terrible covers broke the immersion constantly."
Life plan A and B,"I liked the series enough. The one thing I didn't particularly care for, and I must be in the minority since I haven't seen it voiced elsewhere, was that it felt more of an ensemble, and that Willow was just a supporting character. I was really hoping for Warwick Davis to shine, and I think he can definitely carry a show."
Life plan A and B,They never made a legitimate season 1.
Life plan A and B,"If you didn't want to end up hemming and hawing about sequel possibilities, you should have made sure the people in charge had the property's legacy in mind when developing it, as opposed to their own personal checklist."
Life plan A and B,"Man is a legend, and genuinely a nice guy. I noticed him while traveling through Italy and he actually greeted me!!!!"
Life plan A and B,"I really enjoyed Willow. Here are the main things that bugged me: costumes were too modern, as was the language (including, but not limited to, swears). Most of all, though, was the modern music that ended most episodes and sometimes was played during the episodes proper. Why did the season end with “Money for Nothing”? Best I could figure was because, if there is a second season, the characters will find themselves in Dire Straits."
Life plan A and B,If season 2 is more like episodes 6-8 than 1-5 I’m in.
Life plan A and B,"Show sucks.  So.  Bad.

Could've been handled smartly, wasn't.  Shame."
Life plan A and B,"Yeah I doubt it, even though they definitely aimed for at least another season or two.

* The show was weirdly paced, with some parts aiming to be slow paced while others are cut too quickly to compensate for list time. 

* The atmosphere jumps back and forth between being a YA CW show to a gritty fantasy. It's pretty odd jumping back and forth between characters making immature jokes and a plot significant character dying suddenly. I think we lost a third of the cast by EP 3 for... Dramatic impact? I barely even got attached to them.

* i'm not gonna pretend the original Willow was Shakespeare, but the dialogue was irritating in how modern it was. At least pretend you're in a fantasy setting.

* Every character quips like they're in a Joss Whedon production. At certain moments I'd beg the characters to STOP. TALKING.

* Story is for the most part predictable and dull.

* Character dynamics are forced. There's 0 chemistry between the cast, and Kit is the most insufferable, with Boorman taking second place for the most cliche quip-slinging scoundrel.

* Was it just me or Warwick Davis' didn't even try acting?"
Life plan A and B,This show was… not good.
Life plan A and B,I don't think it makes it to season 2.
Life plan A and B,"If it actually gets renewed, please hire new writers."
Life plan A and B,They had a sequel book series called shadow moon that honestly would have been a better path for them to take.
Life plan A and B,"Being Gen X - I watched the Willow movie probably more than Star Wars New Hope. 

This show was not Willow - it was not the world of Willow. What was the scene with the 1800s frontier people all about? And don’t get me started on the trolls.

The show reeks of nepotism - Jonathan Kasdan does not have the talent of his father, nor the voice of his generation. Yet, time and again, he is given these huge projects because of his relation to his father.

I have little hope for Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny.

Maybe I would’ve enjoyed it more if it didn’t have the “Willow” label.

I laughed a bit and thought there were good moments. But it didn’t feed off the world the original movie built.

I’m all for growing audience awareness and presenting new opportunities for people to become a part of a treasured franchise - some traditions need breaking down, but this series tore down the original foundation the movie built that endeared us to it years ago.

I just can’t believe people signed off after reading the scripts - especially the first one - just bad."
Life plan A and B,"It was … ok. Pretty trope-y YA stuff. Felt like they robbed pretty heavily from everything.  Multiple times it felt like Harry Potter meets LotR meets Fantasy Star Wars, but it was decent for what it was.  Would I ever re-watch or recommend though?  Nope."
Life plan A and B,But it’s so awful
Life plan A and B,"So did they finish the story arc, or is this something else I shouldn't start watching only to be disappointed in a cliffhanger"
Life plan A and B,(Insert Arrested Development reference here)
Life plan A and B,Won’t cry when they cancel it. It’s like the Disney Channel tried to re-imagine Game of Thrones.
Life plan A and B,"I wanted so bad to love this series.  I will do anything to support Warwick Davis, as he's legitimately one of my favorite people on this damn planet.  I LOVE the Willow movie.  I love love love the movie.  I do not subscribe to any streaming services, so when the show was announced, I figured I would be buying Disney+ for a month to watch it, but I was able to watch the first episode at my mom's house.

The first ep is all Ive watched still.  I just couldn't really get  into it.  It didnt grab me like the movie.  It felt *too new* and too unfamiliar.  I still loved seeing Warwick, I still love him as an actor and I know it mustve been so special for him to play Willow again, but Im struggling to get into it and it makes me feel bad."
Life plan A and B,I read that in the Arrested Development narrator's voice.
Life plan A and B,I didn’t even make it past the first episode.
Life plan A and B,"My kids and I loved it, started out a bit rough, but definitely got better. I hope it gets one more roll."
Life plan A and B,I wouldn't bet on it.
Life plan A and B,The story was ok but the dialogue was just awful. It was like watching a bad CW show
Life plan A and B,"I say this as someone who grew up with the movie and still quotes it to this day with friends: this is a truly terrible series. Atrocious writing, editing, casting and acting. From the top down, this production is full of baffling decisions. I would not let Kasdan near another franchise."
Life plan A and B,Let’s do a Legend series instead
Life plan A and B,"Was a fun and funny show, felt like a good d&d campaign or something. I hope they get renewed."
Life plan A and B,"Watched 2 episodes and gave up. The show sucked on so many levels, annoying characters with zero charisma. And how the hell is Davis not the main character. Movie is not that good to begin with, and the show just shat all over the nostalgia it had build up through the years"
Life plan A and B,"I looked forward to this show so much. And I haven’t felt so betrayed since..the last time they revived a franchise Millenials and Xers and Boomers loved and just made it for what old people think Gen Z will like. Horrific writing, editing, production, everything. Why would you do this. We waited forty years and this is what you do? Why, why, why?"
Life plan A and B,"I liked it, it was fun and didn't take itself seriously with some refreshing trope subversions. Would definitely watch a second and third season, as a show it's a nice palate cleanser fom all the other grimdark series."
Life plan A and B,"I just finished it.

I thought it was a limited series.

I thought it was far better than Reddit indicated to me lol.

I was not a fan of the film and so enjoyed this more."
Life plan A and B,"I was sooo disappointed by this series..

The terrible dialogue


The ""princess is a lesbian"" trope


The one good written character arc dying (to free princess from marriage obligations)


Willow just being mopey half the time

Me and wife loved the film and were giddy to see this show.. wife thinks they tried to force too much modern society into a fantasy story, and I just watched it to see if maybe it got better.. it didnt"
Life plan A and B,"The show wasn't great, but it was decent in spots. I actually enjoyed the anachronistic needle drops everyone else seemed bothered by."
Life plan A and B,I'm sure the hundreds of people watching will be eagerly awaiting a second season.
Life plan A and B,Season 2? Most people have never seen episode two
Life plan A and B,Please focus on editing and writing. I really liked some of the themes and visuals especially towards the end but new shows now have this amateurish feel to them.
Life plan A and B,I dropped this series after episode five because it jumped the shark.  Episode five was beyond awful.
Life plan A and B,This needs to be cancelled.
Life plan A and B,I loved it. To be honest I only watched it after having a few on my day off and strictly as a comedy. But I liked it a lot.
Life plan A and B,"""more story to tell"", there was barely any story in this season.
This show was just not good at all. Doesn't  feel anything like the original film."
Life plan A and B,"Willow was extremely derivative and by-the-numbers 90s nostalgia pandering, and I loved every minute of it."
Life plan A and B,"I was a bit irritated by the way they introduced the “Women aren’t accepted as fighters/knights,” thing. In OG Willow, Sorsha was a badass; they could easily have made the setting accepting of women warriors. This made a lot of the conflict in the first episode feel really contrived to me."
Life plan A and B,"I named my kid after something in this amazing movie from my youth and now I am embarrassed because of the show.  I’m sorry kid, I guess I should have named you “Maze Runner Divergent.”"
Life plan A and B,"I had such high hopes for this man, so much hope and then Disney pissed all over it.

Terrible costumes, terrible script, mind numbing dialogue, incoherent and utterly baffling story.

Fucking hell"
Life plan A and B,"I liked it a lot, hope it gets a second season"
Life plan A and B,"I was 5 when the movie came out and my dad watched it on VHS all the time, he loved that movie. I thought it was good, but was never a super fan. I went in having zero expectations and I enjoyed it - mostly for its comedy and it felt like a D&D campaign. I didn’t rewatch the movie beforehand so it’s probably been 15 years since I’ve seen the movie, but I did appreciate the cameos from the movie. There was definitely some random “wtf” moments - but overall I enjoyed it considering how low my expectations were. I feel like they were trying to capture the same kind of audience Netflix gets from Stranger Things."
Life plan A and B,After watching episodes 1-2 I felt the need to watch it all the way through just to see if it could get worse and it did. Was really excited when I heard about the project but that show was bad.
Life plan A and B,"I was looking forward to this the teaser interview with warrick and cast was funny but the show was a train wreck, tone was all over the place. The orginal was average back in the day but had its moments but this was cringy as hell. Still better that the rings of power snooze fest"
Life plan A and B,"this show is very much like the witcher, were the main character has become a support character.  that said, i only watched 2 episodes then i bailed out, because the whole show looked like a bad cosplay. 

and the fun part is we all made fun of sony how they screwed up constantly, yet with the last of us they did everything right. stay close to the source material and let joel and ellie be the main cast.

it is really easy actually, give the fans what they want, instead coming up with your own imagination of how things should be."
Life plan A and B,"Willow is trash, forget about it."
Life plan A and B,Unfortunately the show is flaming hog wart dung
Life plan A and B,"For me, Willow was quite atrocious. 

The acting, delivery, music choice. I literally only like 2 of the characters, I hated Willow himself with a passion and to me, his acting was incredibly subpar. There were a couple of scenes that I enjoyed, but I won’t shed a tear if the show doesn’t get renewed. It was overall quite bad."
Life plan A and B,"It is a fun fantasy. An enjoyable mixture of action, romance and drama, with plenty of jokes. It seems like a three season arc is planned, if the Disney plus drops it, I would like to see it completed in comics or novels."
Life plan A and B,Can't wait to see the new adventures of Strong Female Character and Ginger Plank of Wood..Riveting stuff!
Life plan A and B,If there was ever a show that SHOULD be cancelled it’s Willow.
Life plan A and B,"Willow is horrible. I hope fantasy/scifi shows like this keep failing, while more shows like Andor and HoTD succeed. Course correction is needed."
Life plan A and B,"Willow was always a classic

couldn't stomach more then 3 episodes of that dog shit

wow"
Life plan A and B,This was another huge misfire. Identity politics is all these people care about. They latch onto an existing IP like leeches and then bastardize it.
Life plan A and B,this show needs to not be renewed.
Life plan A and B,"To people who actually finish it, was it good?  I only made it to episode two and had to turn it off."
Life plan A and B,The last two episodes of the first season were so bad that I don't feel like Season 2 anymore
Life plan A and B,This was awful. Such a disappointment. I stopped watching. Shame
Life plan A and B,Ron howard produced this fucking trash?
Life plan A and B,"I loved the hell out of this show.
Willow was one of my childhood favorites, because it was so weird and wonky but fun and adventurous.
I still remember picking up sticks in high school and saying “uuuussse theee waaaaaand Willow!” to make people laugh. 
Hope it gets a second season."
Life plan A and B,"I forgave everything about the series until Money for Nothing kicked in. Great song , terrible choice."
Life plan A and B,I really disliked the first episodes and then someone told me to change the perspective. Since then I think of it as the attempt from a GM to run a Grimdark adventure and the players having other ideas. After that change I enjoyed it really
Life plan A and B,"Hey Ron:  Maybe make season two of ""Willow"" be about *Willow*."
Life plan A and B,Haha. Shoulda made a good show if you wanted to keep this job Ronnie.
Life plan A and B,"I am sure that a majority of the people saying that they didn’t like the series genuinely didn’t like it based on their perception of its merits or lack there of

However I think it should be kept in mind that a large minority of the people saying that they didn’t like the series are saying that because a large part of the story was dedicated to a lesbian romance

Due to that one fact alone most conservative people are not going to like this series but few of them will come right out and admit that that is a reason for them not liking it"
Life plan A and B,"There’s either a ton of shills or bots in this thread, I can’t quite figure out which."
Life plan A and B,I really enjoyed the series. I rooted for the characters. It garnered my full attention.
Life plan A and B,I saw the trailer & knew I would actively avoid it. Then I hear it’s obsessed with modern politics over story once it’s out & count my blessings I never wasted the time.  A damn shame as fond memories of the original.
Life plan A and B,"The Wheel of Time, Lotr and now Willow. All terrible adaptations. We are truly living in the dark ages of fantasy genre on TV."
Life plan A and B,"The show was trash.

Bunch of annoying brats."
Life plan A and B,Narrator: There was no hope or plan but no one bothered to tell Gob .
Life plan A and B,"A Willow TV show is a cool concept, but this tv show doesn’t meet expectations. The problem with the first season is that it shoe horns the distopian fantasy genre into Willow and it feels kinda hallow and lacks the worldbuilding the movie had. The film was also more of an epic fantasy."
Life plan A and B,"I really get baffled when I see the critiques of this show on reddit. I had never seen the movie so I watched it before jumping into the show. If you saw the movie, you knew Willow was a bit of a misfit and the show itself is a band of misfits that both equally get themselves into and out of trouble through both their strengths and weaknesses. Do I think the pacing was off in some episodes? Absolutely. But the people basically expecting Disney Lord of The Rings or Game of Thrones clearly never saw the movie and are just offering extreme critiques for the sake of offering extreme critiques."
Life plan A and B,A no for me. Not after you convince the Former CEO to cancel the Owl House for this.
Life plan A and B,"Shit, I better go watch it so they know I like it!"
Life plan A and B,"The show was just ok, but it felt like it just wasn’t that great.  It felt like it was maybe catering to the wrong audience, instead of focusing on making a great show."
Life plan A and B,"Is it bad if, at this point, if I see Erin Kellyman I just assume it's going to be bad? Not sure why, but she's basically an albatross for Disney shows and movies."
Life plan A and B,Good luck with that Ron.
Life plan A and B,I didn’t enjoy it at all. The writing was terrible and the acting subpar.
Life plan A and B,"My favorite movie growing up and I watched every episode of the show. I can see why people don't like it because it has weird edits and abrupt plot stuff, but I don't think the show took itself too seriously so I didn't either."
Life plan A and B,It’s an incredibly bad show. Shockingly poor.
Life plan A and B,"Wow what a disgrace to your legacy to put your name attached to this project, Ron"
Life plan A and B,Why are the heroes in today's series always women? Really boring. And unrealistic
Life plan A and B,"I managed to watch the entirety of She Hulk so I thought hey, I can watch this, plus top bloke Warwick is always a bonus. nope, an absolute dumpster fire, left midway episode 4, shows where literally everything in it is shit are a sight to behold but even such a sight has its limits"
Life plan A and B,"Fugghedaboutit. 

I bet the ratings are terrible right now and I hardly hear anyone praise it. Even those who ""kind of like it"" warn you it's boring and slow."
Life plan A and B,"I hope not, a real disappointment"
Life plan A and B,I definitely needed more LGBTQ drama in my Willow reboot
Life plan A and B,"Hmmm... So i've been reading some of the responses here - I can totally see why people were a bit ""disappointed""  and maybe I have low expectations (For instance, I liked Rings of Power and hope to get more seasons of that)  

Willow, which I have not finished yet!  On episode... 7 - but Willow... Has been a bit of a rollercoaster.  Semi slow start, gets really dark and entertaining, but have some slow episodes in between.  The episode I'm watching now has taken me a few days to complete haha, but I enjoy it so far.  I want to see more.  I think there definitely can be improvements.  

I'm recommending it to everyone even though I know they'll never watch it, just like I did with Patriot (And now that show is canceled because of my stupid friends and coworkers not taking my advice to watch grrrrr)"
Life plan A and B,"I hope not. This is the series literally no one wanted. It's so fucking bad.  Like dragon ball evolution and Velma bad.

Edit: You people's taste in entertainment scares me."
Life plan A and B,Does he have COVID?
Life plan A and B,I can't be the only one who doesn't give a shit about old 80's/90's re-hashes of barely popular movies. Let's get over this whole nostalgia phase and get some original content for once.
Life plan A and B,Renew Willow and drop that garbage show they call national treasure.

Nurses Who Kill,"Whatever it’s flaws, it was all worth it when Maya screamed, “How the fuck was I supposed to know that?”"
Nurses Who Kill,Jason Bateman being a cat and telling that his revenge would be sweet was fantastic.
Nurses Who Kill,"Yeah totally agree. Pete was an unnecessary addition at the end. He didn't even have time to get up to speed on the premise and he did not gel with the rest of the episode. Really enjoyed Jason and Maya and the rest of the episode until then. When Jason realized Santa was Sean and said ""aw you roped Sean into this?"" I laughed out loud."
Nurses Who Kill,"Master Bateman and Maya Rudolph were great. Marshawn Lynch was a nice surprise (“Oh shit, it’s the dude from Ozark!”).

Pete Davidson was kind of “eh”, but the joke was that a celebrity would be brought in last minute with the expectation that they solve the mystery while knowing absolutely nothing. 

Apparently he was sequestered in his trailer for 4 hours, according to Krister Johnson, writer for Murderville, in the /r/murderville subreddit:

https://www.reddit.com/r/murderville/comments/zm8rz7/_/j0e4mai/"
Nurses Who Kill,"Yeah, but that's the joke, right? The murderer was someone Maya hadn't even met, and Pete was asked to choose the killer with no information at all. There's no way he could have added anything to the investigation, so he was just having fun with it. 

I liked the interplay between the different guests better than the first series where it's just the guest with Terry, but it would probably be better to have them all there from the start. It would be less confusing for the viewer, and hopefully they would actually choose one of the suspects in the end."
Nurses Who Kill,Jasons bird dance was incredible
Nurses Who Kill,It was almost worth it though for Bateman's deadpan scolding of Pete for mocking Donna Foccacias name
Nurses Who Kill,"I absolutely loved the episode and agree that Pete didn’t add anything. I feel I could’ve done what he did, being I have zero acting talent and what not."
Nurses Who Kill,It was almost like Pete was walking by the studio while they were filming the ending and just dragged him in for no reason.
Nurses Who Kill,We said the same thing! It was SO funny but how none of them chose one of the three suspects kinda killed it. I will say I cracked up that Jason picked Santa because it was absolutely absurd. I think the idea of having someone come in at the very end was great but anyone but Pete. His hype needs to be done. If they got Molly Shannon or something that would’ve been awesome.
Nurses Who Kill,Wasn’t the joke that because he was brought in last minute there’s no way he could of known what was going on? I thought it was funny anyway…
Nurses Who Kill,"The thing about him pulling the wires though is that they were about to get him to disarm the bomb anyway so why didn’t they just roll with it and be like “oh, good job Pete. That did it I guess”"
Nurses Who Kill,"Agreed. I loved the special and hope they do more Murderville. But Pete Davidson is just not funny, and this was made more apparent sharing the stage with actors who can actually do improv well."
Nurses Who Kill,"I think Santa was my favorite thing in the episode. From him dying like 3 separate times, to the mannequin bit with the Orphans... i just lost my shit."
Nurses Who Kill,"My wife and I were blitzed when  we watched this on Friday and I cannot remember a time we have laughed more post COVID.  We were extremely happy to see Marshawn make a cameo and we loved him pointing out, ""That's the guy from OZARK!""

Might be the alcohol talking but it was by far our favorite thus far!"
Nurses Who Kill,"I kinda like how it feels like improv between friends and a chaotic mess. Also makes it feel more real, less set up and less rehearsed or prepped for as some shows that fake realism can be. Tho it is better when will arnett is trying not to laugh and the comedian digs in to make him laugh. There’s few times where arnett or the other actor is trying to drag some improv out of the guest whose stuck but you can’t win them all in improv.

Throwing Pete last minute was some wild farcical comedy. If you don’t care if he solves it or not it is funny how lost he is"
Nurses Who Kill,I think he would have chosen the mint girl if he didn’t see both Maya and Jason picking outside the box. The bomb thing was absolutely dumb. But it was an enjoyable episode nonetheless.
Nurses Who Kill,"The ending did piss me off a bit, and I was surprised that having three professional comedians resulted in them all going against the basic fundamentals of improv comedy.

Definitely would have been better without Pete, but I wouldn't have minded them bringing in a third person at the end.  I liked the underlying premise of ""This guy has no knowledge of anything that has transpired yet.""  Marshawn Lynch would have been good."
Nurses Who Kill,That was literally the entire joke but alright lol
Nurses Who Kill,Agreed completely.
Nurses Who Kill,"I like Pete more than the average redditor but he straight up sucked. He didn’t even try to play along at all, didn’t say a single useful or funny thing, and then pulled all the wires on the bomb at the end which is just textbook terrible improv."
Nurses Who Kill,Still can’t believe no one made a joke at the end about it being an arresting development
Nurses Who Kill,I never knew in wanted a Jason Bateman Maya Rudolph team up and now I want a whole movie
Nurses Who Kill,It’s crazy to think an actor with no range or ability to maintain character spent so many years on a live variety sketch show.
Nurses Who Kill,He was fine. Is he as good as the others? No but he absolutely didn’t “ruin” anything and imo played off decently with the other cast. It ain’t perfect but I think it’s obnoxious to write a whole post about it.
Nurses Who Kill,"I wonder what the back story to it was in real life. Like was he just chilling near the studio and someone was like “hey were filming this come join! It’s not like you need a script” or something similar. 

It didn’t seem planned (not that much is) but in some ways that’s the charm of it. 

Or maybe it was just horribly planned out. I’m going to hope there is an amusing backstory."
Nurses Who Kill,"I did love the idea of bringing in a 3rd person with absolutely no understanding of what has already happened, right at the very end... but agree.  I wish Davidson had taken it a little more seriously, even if I did laugh at most of what he did.  Including pulling all the wires.

That said, though.  We went back and rewatched the others after the special and I do like the way the Christmas special flowed, and felt like it was more of a murder mystery party of friends, than the others did, because of the character breaks and things."
Nurses Who Kill,"Agreed, I just don't understand how he keeps getting work. I used to think it was a conspiracy that the entertainment industry force feed you certain people, but I 100% believe it with him. He's smarmy and not funny, who are his fans? What does he actually bring to the table? I'll never understand it."
Nurses Who Kill,"I agree. The episode was great, but Pete Davidson almost ruined it. 

I really tried to give him a chance, but Pete was laughing the whole time and pointed the finger at Will just to seem funny. He wasn’t even playing the game. When he pulled all the wires, I just gave up. He was an awful addition to the story. 

Referencing the Smartless podcast, what if they got Justin Theroux instead of Pete Davidson? That would have been gold."
Nurses Who Kill,I don't like Pete Davidson. Don't get what his appeal his. He's not talented in my eyes. Just a run of the mill chum.
Nurses Who Kill,"I groaned when >!Pete Davidson!< lumbered onto the scene. Didn't add anything of value. I wish it had been someone like Michael Cera as a sort of wink and a nod to Arrested Development, like how they had >!Sean Hayes!< on there as a reference to >!the Smartless podcast!<."
Nurses Who Kill,"If you've not seen it you should check out Murder in Successville, which is the original version of the show."
Nurses Who Kill,Pete Davidson ruined it to be honest.
Nurses Who Kill,"I guess I was the opposite. Pete is pretty well known for breaking at the drop of a hat so you just have to have that expectation and enjoy it when it happens. Especially since Bateman had made several fourth wall breaking comments and Maya broke when she heard Santa was dead. It's one of those shows where breaking can add to the show, rather than detract."
Nurses Who Kill,"Yeah I wish the celebrities played along, that's supposed to be part of the fun of this kind of show"
Nurses Who Kill,I died when they asked Jason Bateman to dance and he pulled the “ca-caw ca-caw” chicken dance from arrested development
Nurses Who Kill,"By the end my impression of things was that:

Maya was all in and enjoying the hell out of it

Bateman was over it and contemplating who he was going to kill first, Will Arnett for getting him involved (since I imagine that is how it happened) or his agent because agents.

And that Davidson had been walking by while they were filming and some producer yanked him in off the street for the hell of it."
Nurses Who Kill,"I loved it when Maya accused the mayor who immediately said, ""the fuck?"""
Nurses Who Kill,I’m not the biggest Pete Davidson fan but I really enjoyed the unnecessary addition. It was more so a joke to add someone at the last second who missed the entire case and then have them pick who they think the killer is. Also how could you not break if you’re coming into the end of the episode?
Nurses Who Kill,"The kind of “cardinal rule” for improv is the “yes, and” approach. Pete didn’t say yes to any set ups; he didn’t play along with the bomb wire. He gave his present to someone who wasn’t a suspect. He just sat and smiled and didn’t attempt any effort to get into any sort of character. 
I think a lot of us had bigger expectations because he was on a comedy sketch show, but he either doesn’t have the chops or he prefers to bring chaos and watch everyone shift to his style. 
It’s way more fun to watch improv when everyone tries to gel; he gave no gifts/easy lifts to the other teammates and he heightened zero scenes. The ability to keep the bit going is all on Will, Jason, Maya and the supporting cast."
Nurses Who Kill,"It had its moments, but the whole thing didn’t feel well put together.  It’s like they started filming and decided to call Maya and Pete to see if they were free to swing by. 

They should have all been in a group from the start."
Nurses Who Kill,"Completely agree. I was so disappointed bc Pete seemed to not play the “game” and instead seemed to want to just f up the story line. 
It made no sense adding him. 
Also they should have brought in Maya earlier in the show."
Nurses Who Kill,Me and my girlfriend thought him showing up out of the blue was one of the best parts of the episode.
Nurses Who Kill,I don’t blame Pete because they brought him on right at the end and he didn’t have any context. I wish instead of staggering the guests they were all present at the beginning. Or they did separate episodes. Overall thought it was great. Loved Jason’s nod to Arrested Development with the chicken dance
Nurses Who Kill,It's the American remake of Murder in Successville in case anyone else was confused.
Nurses Who Kill,"I feel almost completely the opposite about the episode. I thought everything until Pete showed up was weaker than most of the regular episodes, but when he showed up the chaos it brought was hilarious. I don't think without him there Jason and Maya would have picked the killers they did, and it just raised everything up. There's no way it would work as a normal thing, but for a special episode it was a great ending."
Nurses Who Kill,"Yeah I wish the celebrities played along, that's supposed to be part of the fun of this kind of show"
Nurses Who Kill,Everything was perfectly imperfect and the entire special was wonderful.
Nurses Who Kill,I didn’t mind Pete Davidson. He didn’t add anything spectacular but his laugh was contagious as a viewer
Nurses Who Kill,"That's why it was funny.

No matter who you bring in, if they're only there for the last 5min, they'd act the same way bc they have no sense of the pacing or what the other 2 ppl have gone through the entire time. 

I found that hilarious."
Nurses Who Kill,I think that was the point a bit. To bring some doofus looking guy in who was clueless and had 30 seconds to make a decision and wouldn’t take it seriously.
Nurses Who Kill,"Honestly, just having Pete Davidson in a cast is an immediate ""no thanks"" from me, no matter how amazing it might be. Kermit-looking motherfucker is just awful with stupid tattoos."
Nurses Who Kill,Before he came in I was sure I'd rewatch it in a year's time. His appearance made it much much worse.
Nurses Who Kill,"Yeah, WTF why was Pete Davidson even there. He had no context, no frame of reference, he didn't seem like he wanted to play along."
Nurses Who Kill,Agreed!
Nurses Who Kill,I agree about Pete Davidson but I was laughing so hard even that couldn’t ruin it for me. I think Bateman is the perfect type of entertainer to do these things because he is so ridiculously deadpan with his comedy and he didn’t break no matter what absurd things they made him do. Leslie Nielsen would be proud.
Nurses Who Kill,"honestly this episode was hilarious - the end was a bit annoying, but everything else was **great**"
Nurses Who Kill,[deleted]
Nurses Who Kill,"Or when Maya said, “50 Seconds, MacGruber!”"
Nurses Who Kill,I love Jason but Maya was SO fucking funny
Nurses Who Kill,"I laughed the most when that other officer came in when they're interviewing the assistant and Maya goes, ""now who the fuck is that?!"" This show is lots of fun, and I loved seeing Jason Bateman in it as well! Dug the little AD callback with his quick chicken impersonation. If you can even call it that...I'm not convinced he's ever seen one."
Nurses Who Kill,"""I never met him!"""
Nurses Who Kill,"Or when the lady cop showed up and Maya said ""who the fuck was that?"""
Nurses Who Kill,"Oh god that was hilarious. I laughed a lot this episode - watching Jason having to go through all of the debasing stuff set up and talking about having time to plot his revenge.. Sean laughing, the naked guy."
Nurses Who Kill,He was such a good sport not hesitating to go full in on playing a cat. But casually vocalizing that he would get Arnete back for it was gold.
Nurses Who Kill,"When he tried to do mouth to mouth, I almost died"
Nurses Who Kill,"> He didn't even have time to get up to speed on the premise

To be fair, that was the joke.  But yeah, he didn't go along with anything and that ruined the ending a bit."
Nurses Who Kill,"I wasn't sure who ""Sean"" was or how Jason Bateman knew him lol"
Nurses Who Kill,"> He didn't even have time to get up to speed on the premise

That was the joke."
Nurses Who Kill,"The improv masters were great and all, but the completely natural reaction of ""Oh shit, it's the guy from Ozark."" has to be my favorite bit in the whole thing."
Nurses Who Kill,"> but the joke was that a celebrity would be brought in last minute with the expectation that they solve the mystery while knowing absolutely nothing. 

They need to send that one back to the drawing board"
Nurses Who Kill,"""Who's the assistant?""

 ""That one.

 ""oh, she did it.""

And he STILL didn't pick her."
Nurses Who Kill,I'd watch a full Pete episode for sure
Nurses Who Kill,"""caw, caw"""
Nurses Who Kill,it's from 'arrested development' where Will Arnett used to do this dance in front of Jason!
Nurses Who Kill,"I didn’t even know who he was and assumed he was a DJ or something since he didn’t seem like he could act and wasn’t funny. Possibly an athlete, but like, for poker or something."
Nurses Who Kill,"It was an easier case than the other episodes by a mile - my partner noticed right away that all the name tags were smudged because they were written by someone left-handed and then I picked out that the killer's name tag was not smudged because they were writing it themselves to replace the one they lost.

But the fact that nobody even guessed one of the suspects was a far better outcome than the prior episodes where they just flounder with a random guess. The Mayor, suicide, and Seattle were great picks."
Nurses Who Kill,"I LOVE the fact that there are three suspects, three detectives, and no one picked any of them.  It feels like an instant, unspoken agreement of ""if we don't know, we won't pick.""  And Pete seemed to pick up on it, too."
Nurses Who Kill,"Yes, they really needed someone with improv training. Imagine Amy Poehler or Will Ferrell or even Martin Short in that role."
Nurses Who Kill,"I will say that this episode also seemed way harder to solve than the others.  I don't know if that was because of the multiple guest stars or what.  I didn't pick up on the mint drink at all.  The nametag smear was an obvious clue, but somehow I forgot all about it by the time we met Jim.  And I think the ""magic hands"" was a real stretch, though she was the only thing I go right and that was only because of how crazy she was and honestly I assumed her cat would have done the licking."
Nurses Who Kill,"His hype will be done when he stops bagging the top ""newly available talent"" every six months.  It's a damn right of passage at this point.  

Ariana Grande, Kate Beckinsale, Kaia Gerber, Phoebe Dynevor, Kim Kardashian, Margaret Qualley and now Emily Ratajkowski?  The guy's a machine."
Nurses Who Kill,Right? I though the absurdity of it made it worth the joke
Nurses Who Kill,"I *think* the plan was to have Maya and Jason try and explain the absolute absurdity they just witnessed and basically have him go on that. THey did it a little bit but I don't think they got what they wanted.

I didn't hate it as most of the others, here. I thought it was funny enough."
Nurses Who Kill,"Where's that ""could of/could have"" bot?"
Nurses Who Kill,"True. The absolute funniest scenes in the UK original are ones where everyone breaks character because they're laughing too much. This is my favourite:

https://youtu.be/kphVef2S2bI"
Nurses Who Kill,"I agree because I've seen this opinion posted everywhere and I think people are taking this obviously silly and fun show way too seriously. ""No one picking a real suspect ruined it for me."" Really?! I was rolling laughing at that and so was the crew in the background, it was a great moment!"
Nurses Who Kill,"I think you hate Pete Davidson a bit too much if him being there for five minutes ruined a hilarious episode with some insane performances.

I think the “Chad” sketches are dumb, and he’s not really my cup of tea, but I didn’t recoil (lol coil) when he walked out. It was more of an “Oh, that guy.”"
Nurses Who Kill,He was really good in King of Staten Island
Nurses Who Kill,Jason also did a bit of the chicken dance when he was singing his elf song.
Nurses Who Kill,"Aww, now I'm going to be forever sad that it wasn't Michael Cera. His personality would've been great for this special."
Nurses Who Kill,Sean also randomly appeared in a bit with Will on Lego Masters a few weeks ago.
Nurses Who Kill,And it's amazing
Nurses Who Kill,I lost it when he just pulled the wires on the bomb. I like Pete. I really don't understand why people hate him so much.
Nurses Who Kill,"> He gave his present to someone who wasn’t a suspect.

So did Jason and Maya"
Nurses Who Kill,">He gave his present to someone who wasn’t a suspect. 

Can you imagine if the other two had done that?!"
Nurses Who Kill,"I do, he still didn’t go along with the scenes. He’s a talentless amateur."
Nurses Who Kill,It rhymes with Sean Hayes and sounds like a bad ass athlete
Nurses Who Kill,The actual name might be familiar if you’re a ghost rider fan
Nurses Who Kill,I loved that part so much

Aussie Gold Hunters,"Yeah, it was on TV over here in the UK, a lot of the people I know remember it fondly, although that may say more about the people I know than the popularity of the show.

Always associate it with the Moomins, crazy shows that I wasn't entirely sure why I enjoyed but did, I guess."
Aussie Gold Hunters,A lot of Australian kids tv shows were popular here in the UK.
Aussie Gold Hunters,"American here.

I remember it. It was on around the same time as Erie Indiana... which was similar in premise, but I felt a better show."
Aussie Gold Hunters,"I remember it aired on Fox Kids in the late 90s... I recall seeing one episode about a lighthouse that was haunted by ghosts.  Something about people wanting to tear it down and refusing to believe that ghosts were inhabitants until some little kid started singing Danny Boy which brought out the ghosts for everyone to see...  


That was all I remember of the show during that time.   I think it aired along the same time as Young Hercules (staring Ryan Gosling LOL) and another show about 4 medieval heroes (one was black) with magical weapons and Irish accents.  "
Aussie Gold Hunters,"CBC aired it here in Canada for a few years. I wasn't in the right age demo when they did, but it was still unique enough that I remembered it right away."

Aussie Gold Hunters,"I don't think Rebels is a bad show, but it's at its best when it's standing on the shoulders of what TCW started."
Aussie Gold Hunters,"Rebels gets the distinction of containing the most samurai-ass thing to every happen in the Star Wars universe IMO, [spoiler](#s ""the single-stroke battle between Darth Maul and Obi-wan Kenobi""). Motivations are crystal-clear on both sides, buildup has been happening over the entire course of Phantom Menace and both series, and it's wonderfully choreographed and shot.

The show can certainly be uneven (especially in the first season), but its high points are incredibly high."
Aussie Gold Hunters,"By the end of The Clone Wars, I felt like a few key episodes could replace most of the prequels. We got to see more of Anakin being tempted by the Dark Side and his relationship with Ashoka was more meaningful than most of his interactions in the prequel movies. Yoda's experiences were also interesting towards the end, leading into Empire Strikes Back nicely. I found many episodes tedious. Like many shows with an ensemble of characters, some episodes move the character arcs forward, while some episodes just coast along with action and weird sub-plots. In my opinion, the weird sub-plots in episodic television indicates that the network or producers are trying to extend a series beyond what is really necessary.

As for Rebels, it is very kid-oriented and some episodes are not really interesting to this adult. It is interesting watching perhaps the only two active Jedi explore the Force and help the Rebellion, but I am glad this is the last season - it feels at times like they did not put much thought into the story. When we saw the Rebel fleet enter the show it got better, and there is some interesting backstory that ties into A New Hope."
Aussie Gold Hunters,"TCW was amazing.  
The style,animation and everything else got better as the seasons progressed (I mostly just avoided the droid arc)   
Showing Anakin,Obi Wan in their prime, establishing clones as smart,versatile soldiers that can hold their own even against some powerful foes and get out of really sticky situations, that's what i wanted to watch.  

Now, I did watch Rebels...and i don't like it nearly as much, the style just bothers me from Ezras blue hair to the weird elongated lightsabers. The story is alright i guess, but it does little to humanize the rebels (the rebels are potrayed like droids literally, i'm talking about the soldiers not the main/second characters), the stormtroopers, who were part of the Empire that ruled most of the known universe are portrayed as mindless idiots. The show really lost it's mature side.  "
Aussie Gold Hunters,rebels made me start watching TCW and I am midway through it now. With that being said  I never knew TCW would be as dark as it is. I avoided it while it aired because I thought it was some kiddie garbage but now I learned its not.  
Aussie Gold Hunters,"the clone wars was great

rebels, I think rebels suffers alot
and is confused about what it wants to be

you have ezra being set up with an awesome dark side storyline
then that disapears and he is back to comic relief

and then you get episodes like twin suns
which are amazing and feel like the purest of starwars
"
Aussie Gold Hunters,"I think they are both great in their own ways. Clone Wars has so many amazing story arcs, characters & epic Star Wars moments that we never got from the movies. However it has alot of mediocre filler along the way. But overall it is a must watch for any serious Star Wars fan.

I actually like Rebels even more just because of how fresh it is. I just hope they don't get too cute with it in the end - these characters pretty much all need to be completely wiped out eventually otherwise I can't really buy that this whole faction would have existed and not have been mentioned up until now. Sort of like Rogue One. Rebels also has its fair share of filler, but it doesn't get in the way too much. This might be an unpopular opinion but I feel like the best episodes of Rebels are behind us. The third season just didn't hold up as well to the first two in my opinion. Have yet to start the new season.

For someone that's not a big Star Wars fan though, these should both be hard passes."
Aussie Gold Hunters,"TCW was great. The best episodes were the ones focusing on the clones and not the Jedi. The Umbra arc and the Order 66/microchip arc were the best as well as the last few episodes involving Ahsoka.

As far as Rebels goes, it's been all right. Season 2 was the best and it ended great and got me hyped for Season 3. But 3 ended up really disappointing. The end of 2 seemed to set up Ezra as falling towards the dark side, which I thought would be a huge deal in season 3, but they kinda just resolved it in like an episode or two. Ezra used a couple of powers he learned from the Sith holocron and Kanan told him not to do that shit, and he just said ""okay fine"". That was it. Darth Maul also didn't really play as big of a role as I thought he would either. And then there's Thrawn. Another disappointment. Whenever there was a conflict between his Imperials and any of the Rebels, they'd always get away with him saying something along the lines of ""It's all part of the plan"". Then in the season finale when this plan comes together and they attack Chopper base, Phoenix Squadron escapes due to some Deus Ex Machina thanks to the Bendu.

I just hope season 4 is better. I haven't watched this week's episode yet."
Aussie Gold Hunters,"I was a big fan of the TCW Clone Wars and have grown to like Rebels. 

Rebels is more of a caper show. It has good set pieces and enclosed episodes. Clone Wars was definitely darker and very grey. "
Aussie Gold Hunters,"Starting watching TCW last week and so far, so good. Something that I look forward when consuming any Star Wars movie and series is an expansion of the universe and the characters and the show does that flawlessly. Anakin and Obi-Wan relationship is something really well made. I'm still thinking how I'm gonna Revenge of the Sith having that knowledge. "
Aussie Gold Hunters,">Most of the characters in rebels are completely new, unlike in TCW we have no idea who these people are

Hold up right there. While most of the main characters in rebels are new, theres a whole host of characters we've seen before in supporting roles. TCW relied on a main cast we'd seen in the movies but had far more rand new support roles."
Heavy Rescue: 401,I watch it just to see stupid drivers and tow truck operators lose their shit under a little bit of pressure.

Heavy Rescue: 401,"Not only are the shows unwatchable for the audio aspect, the visual one is a disgrace as well. Not even worth the effort of complaining, just don't bother watching and don't bother complaining it's past the point of being worthwhile, they're too far gone."
Heavy Rescue: 401,"At this point in time, history absolutely needs to play those hitler documentaries nonstop, along with docs on the rise of nazism "
Heavy Rescue: 401,I actually like Gold Rush because I had no idea how small time gold mining was done. It’s interesting to watch or at least as a background noise. 
Heavy Rescue: 401,"holy papyrus Batman

while Homeland certainly has a more nuanced approach to themes, the underlying flavour is the same as 24 or any other American show. Carrie and Saul represent America therefore good, and the terrorists are still bad. Once you peel off all the facade, that's the ultimate message. Still a good show"
Heavy Rescue: 401,"While I enjoyed bits of homeland, you can't really look at shows like this with anything but cynicism. It's literally CIA propaganda. It's feeding you a narrative they want you to believe is adjacent to reality. For that reason I strongly recommend people stay away from anything that involves the US military in media that was produced in the US. It almost always is propaganda. The entire concept of the ""war on terrorism"" is."
Heavy Rescue: 401,Were people relieved when Brody was dropped? I dropped the show after the end of season 4 or 5. To me it was just a terrible shell of it's former self at that point. I've been thinking of giving it a second chance lately.
Heavy Rescue: 401,That wasn't the message at all you saw a lot to sympathize with along the way.
Heavy Rescue: 401,Did you even pay attention to the show? Because it definitely does not paint our government well at all.
Heavy Rescue: 401,"If you like and miss Homeland, this show is worth watching until the end. It was 8 seasons and they made a finale that is one of the most fantastic in TV series (unlike what they did with Game of Thrones).

Tier 1 season in the Homeland: 1, 2, 4, 8;

Tier 2 season in the Homeland: 5, 7;

Tier 3 season in the Homeland: 3, 6."
Heavy Rescue: 401,"I mean, it does in many respects, for one it still paints us as the good guys in the middle east.. but also it's widely known Homeland was developed as propaganda that paints some really incredible lies about the nature of the US involvement in other countries.

Tales of Zestiria the X,Could have been 1 one hour episode.
Tales of Zestiria the X,"He wasn't looking for a weaponised plane, he was expecting the fighter jet without the weapons though."
Tales of Zestiria the X,"This is just a clickbait headline, the plane was never going to have weapons (except for being a high speed fighter jet itself) and the show IMO leaned towards the kind of over-the-top advertising at the time. 
It was fun and a bit of nostalgia for a person like me who lived through all of that."
Tales of Zestiria the X,"I watched it. Lame ending, but it’s a true story so you can’t help how it ends. Seeing that Michael Avenatti was involved was an interesting twist, though."
Tales of Zestiria the X,I actually didn’t mind it
Tales of Zestiria the X,[Simpsons did it](https://youtu.be/YaYc5UP8PsI) better.
Tales of Zestiria the X,"I really  enjoyed it. It was corny af, but had a wholesome 90s vibe I really enjoyed. A little long but I thought it was a lot of fun. And Mike Avenanti showing up under house arrest weeks before getting a decade in prison is hilarious"
Tales of Zestiria the X,I watched it and Pepsi 100% owes that man a Jet.
Tales of Zestiria the X,"Was a nice fun watch. Definitely overlong but had a good positive vibe so didn't mind it too much. They could have maybe focussed more on the legal side from neutral point of view and asked experts about their views. That could have made the script tighter.

And the coke challenge with the main characters was fun too! Especially the first reaction when Todd said they both taste like shit lol."
Tales of Zestiria the X,"Specifically said not weaponized. Otherwise, I thought was interesting in how it became a landmark for legal rhetoric going forward."
Tales of Zestiria the X,"Honestly, the story lost some of its magic for me once he realized they can just write a check for the points. I was intrigued by his whole plan to buy all the Pepsi and rent warehouses to store them etc etc. 

But then once they saw you can just send in money, they did exactly that and I started to wonder if he did it as a publicity stunt."
Tales of Zestiria the X,"Nobody mentions the problem with protagonist being interviewed as a grown man in front of the jet the entire time, although the story ends nowhere near that spectacular."
Tales of Zestiria the X,Everyone that went to law school ever after this case collectively sighed already knowing how it ended.
Tales of Zestiria the X,Deweaponised* plane. (Which was legal to own)
Tales of Zestiria the X,"The legal landmark moral of this story:  
Don't make an offer if you're not prepared to deliver."
Tales of Zestiria the X,"They really could have done the whole thing in like...90 mins.  Clearly they were never gonna give him a jet, but offering him 2 cases of pepsi for his trouble was pretty sad."
Tales of Zestiria the X,"I find ""oddly dull"" applies to 99% of streaming content"
Tales of Zestiria the X,"Misleading title, he wasnt expecting weapons"
Tales of Zestiria the X,"Went to watch, saw it was 4 episodes and went ""nope."" The whole story can be told in 45 minutes... wtf?"
Tales of Zestiria the X,"Terrible title.

They never wanted a weaponized version.  Hell they called and asked if it was possible to own one without weapons and the answer was yes."
Tales of Zestiria the X,He didn’t get it and Stormy Daniels lawyer showed up.
Tales of Zestiria the X,"I legit don’t understand why we let companies just blatantly lie and mislead people, but that seems to be an unpopular takeaway from this."
Tales of Zestiria the X,Not true. He knew it wasn’t going to be weaponized. Just operational
Tales of Zestiria the X,I actually really enjoyed it. Watched it one sitting with my girlfriend and we didn’t wanna turn it off lol..some of the editing was really great and there wasn’t any droning narration to put us to sleep…it was a fun story to watch.
Tales of Zestiria the X,"This is another one of those annoyingly edited nostalgia docs on Netflix. There are so many of them and they’re so annoying and pointless. 

Documentary: Remember when this happened and how this looked like this and how funny that was?

Viewer: Yeah, I remember that!

Documentary: That sure was cool, wasn’t it?

Viewer: Uh huh"
Tales of Zestiria the X,Stop reading after review claimed only one guy noticed lack of fine print.
Tales of Zestiria the X,"Yeah I watched the first episode and stopped. I couldn't believe they made a multi episodic show from this.

Most of the first episode was just fillers, fluff, and needless crap interwoven into the story just for the sake of expanding the runtime"
Tales of Zestiria the X,Ya it wasn’t weaponized.
Tales of Zestiria the X,If they watched the series they would know it wouldn't have been weaponized.
Tales of Zestiria the X,"Just watched this w my girl last night, we like it"
Tales of Zestiria the X,"Was good and he didn’t want a weaponized plane.  

Other than that, good title"
Tales of Zestiria the X,The show was good. The guardian is worthless.
Tales of Zestiria the X,So did he get the plane or what?!?
Tales of Zestiria the X,*oddly* dull? it's not like the subject screams great excitement
Tales of Zestiria the X,The sub editor who wrote the headline didn’t watch the show. The checked about 10 minutes in to the first episode if it was possible to get harrier jump jets with weapons removed.
Tales of Zestiria the X,He wanted the jet not the weapons. Calling it weaponized is inaccurate. Fighter jets can be owned and used by the public if they got the money. Of course they strip out a lot of weapons related components.
Tales of Zestiria the X,"The guy was just some douche who teamed up with his millionaire friend. Literally had enough money to throw it away on the chance they could pull it off. 

This is the story of rich assholes trying to make more money. I don't care about how they waste their money."
Tales of Zestiria the X,"The jet wouldn’t have been “weaponized”. This title is misleading. It’s legal to own military equipment as a civilian, but certain things are disabled or taken off first. 

I actually enjoyed this show. I was upset at Pepsi over the Philippines. I will never buy another product again if theirs."
Tales of Zestiria the X,"Shit headline. Pepsi promised a fighter jet, and he met the stipulations to earn it, then they reneged."
Tales of Zestiria the X,"I really liked it! Did it need to be three or four episodes, no, but it had a cute framing device and I liked the surprise twist that it’s actually not about the jet, but about the friendship between the college kid and his business partner”, and ethics between friends. It was cute! I finished in the same evening while doing paperwork. He didn’t get the jet, but he did find his purpose (became a lawyer,) began a lifelong friendship, a great lift, and always has this really cool story."
Tales of Zestiria the X,"Good reminiscences on '90s advertising and sitdowns with industry professionals from a specific campaign, very interesting recounting of a mentorship between the protagonist and his sponsor; a hypothetical multi-part episode from the kind of series you'd almost want CNBC or Bloomberg to screen during off-market hours."
Tales of Zestiria the X,I can’t stand how every Netflix doco needs to do a 40 minute deep dive into the history / founders / childhood life of creator / company or whatever whenever they’re filming. 90% of the time it’s completely irrelevant and dead boring.
Tales of Zestiria the X,"#1. It’s not weaponized. 
#2. It’s not a plane, it is a jet. 
#3. It’s not dull. It’s hilarious. 
#4. Fuck Pepsi Co. Evil bastards."
Tales of Zestiria the X,"15 min in and turned off. I usually watch documentary stuff, but the main character just came off as dislikable. I don't know if it was the excitement they were trying to inject, but it wasn't appealing to me."
Tales of Zestiria the X,Sounds like this show would make a good 10 min youtube video..
Tales of Zestiria the X,Why did they not make a documentary about that time [a Pepsi campaign in the Philippines left five dead?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pepsi_Number_Fever)
Tales of Zestiria the X,"To this day I am shocked at the number of people who will try to argue that Pepsi should have had to come up with a plane. Like it's such an absurdly obvious joke. I was 12 when that commercial aired and I never thought it was anything other than a joke and thought these guys were tools at the time for trying to claim it.

What if, instead of a jet, it had been ""You get a moon base"" Would anyone still try to argue the point? That's an equally plausible idea for anyone who isn't a complete idiot."
Tales of Zestiria the X,"I was familiar with this case before, and when I saw my wife watching this, I was wondering how they managed to make a full series out of this. You could sum this up in a 20 minutes video and not lose any interesting content.  
Netflix is just spamming content for us to watch now."
Tales of Zestiria the X,"I feel they could have trimmed this entire series down to a good ten, fifteen minutes tops."
Tales of Zestiria the X,"Show was wayyyy too long. That being said, Pepsi 1000% owes that kid a jet."
Tales of Zestiria the X,A six part series about one time getting bad shrimp.
Tales of Zestiria the X,"A guy with no legal case whatsoever sued Pepsi, they still offered a settlement which he declined, and then he lost in court as he absolutely should have. End of story."
Tales of Zestiria the X,Still think he should have won this
Tales of Zestiria the X,"Tv execs need to understand when something is documentary series worthy, and when its 20 minute video essay worthy.

Why the fuck would i pay for a stream service to watch *class action park* when i can just watch the defunctland episode about it"
Tales of Zestiria the X,"I watched it the pentagon said yes you may own a demilitarized jet , later in the film they walked back the statement. With that being said normal civilians own WW2 tanks and other forms of heavy equipment. There are heavy rules and regulations and taxes in place on said hardware. None the less Pepsi did drop the ball and thought no one would believe the add campaign. I was one of those kids when this campaign ran back in the day who said no way in hell is anyone getting a new a the time vertical take off jet fighter . Since this debacle we now have 10 minutes long disclaimers that might cause anal leakage or swollen nipples and subject to change."
Tales of Zestiria the X,So god damn tired of everything from my childhood being a shitty netflix documentary.
Tales of Zestiria the X,The guy who didn't get sarcasm...
Tales of Zestiria the X,"He asked the DoD if a civilian could get a harrier they said yes, without the weapons and radars etc. then they the bacon guy said later on a press release “Hurr durr no a civilian can’t cause it’s a war plane hurr durr” which does not and did not address a demilitarized version. Which I believe is a valid question to have answered; which I suspect we would find to be yes a civilian can own a demilitarized piece of military hardware."
Tales of Zestiria the X,Watched it and felt like I lost a chunk of my life.  It had your hopes up right till the end.  What was the point?
Tales of Zestiria the X,"very strange that ever got made, it was like, thank you for wasting my time"
Tales of Zestiria the X,Not sure what it says about the Netflix audience that this is a top show. Along with two incredibly privileged foreigners complaining about their family
Tales of Zestiria the X,Its about a 30 second wikipedia read
Tales of Zestiria the X,"Dude was obsessed after a while, kind of annoying. 

Climbed mountains for a living/hobby? Obviously had money since work was never really talked about. Wanted something that was advertised then got all pissy when it wasn’t given to him."
Tales of Zestiria the X,"The start of this series begins in 1995 and they used Fatboy Slim’s “Praise You” as a background track. As a tween/teen of the late 90s, that bothered the shit out of me."
Tales of Zestiria the X,"first of all, it’s Weaponized, not weponised, and second of all, do people not know what a decommissioned jet is? You can buy mig-29s."
Tales of Zestiria the X,It was so boring
Tales of Zestiria the X,It was boring. I don’t even remember that commercial. The dumbest part is…the dude didn’t take $ Pepsi offered him. The McDonald lottery documentary was much better.
Tales of Zestiria the X,J a mail p  b
Tales of Zestiria the X,It could have been one episode. They repeat themselves so many times.
Tales of Zestiria the X,I liked it. I did have the worst hangover in probably the last two years while watching it though. It is good for that.
Tales of Zestiria the X,"This series is selling the 90s, shoulda been an hour and done. Still, I appreciate Netflix production on what could be a YouTube video."
Tales of Zestiria the X,Huh I’ve had this in my queue - if it’s dull should I drop it?
Tales of Zestiria the X,"wikipedia article:   exists. 

netflix :   let’s make more crap!"
Tales of Zestiria the X,I loved the nostalgia of it.  They should of used the last episode for kool-aid points though.  I saved enough for a Mr Kool-Aid pitcher/jug.
Tales of Zestiria the X,"Jesus. What a headline. 

I really enjoyed the light humour of almost all of the 4 45-minute Episodes and had some good lights along the way. 

I recommend it. It won’t change your life, though, like some of the shows that progressional reviewers privacy wish that you were watching /s"
Tales of Zestiria the X,Bart gets an elephant
Tales of Zestiria the X,"It felt like a made-for-tv filler piece with how slow the pacing was, really felt like they were trying to eat up as much time as possible"
Tales of Zestiria the X,It's so exhaustingly boring. And should have only been one episode.
Tales of Zestiria the X,"I thought it was pretty enjoyable. Maybe a tad long, but I remember this happening, so it was a fun watch."
Tales of Zestiria the X,I haven't watched it...can't see it being better than the 20 minute youtube video I watched 5 years or so ago
Tales of Zestiria the X,I work in marketing for a highly regulated industry (ie a long of fine print) and we often get blasted by executives because of all the fine print we have to put on our ads. This series really demonstrated why its so important
Tales of Zestiria the X,Where’s my elephant?
Tales of Zestiria the X,It’s not dull but this story is like a 10 minute YouTube video not a whole doc
Tales of Zestiria the X,"Love how the end is basically, “so we didn’t get the money or the plane”"
Tales of Zestiria the X,drag out way to long
Tales of Zestiria the X,A lot of (if not all) the Netflix pop culture docuseries seem to be copies of stuff from YouTube. Only differences being (1)turning a 45~60 minute video into a series of 6 or more episodes and (2)making the content a lot less interesting.
Tales of Zestiria the X,It wasn’t weaponized.  They verified with the Pentagon that it would be allowed if the missile weapons systems were removed. So kinda a de-weaponized jet.
Tales of Zestiria the X,"Hey Raytheon, I’m suing pepsi if you don’t put some sidewinders on this harrier."
Tales of Zestiria the X,Lol what makes this more than a 30 minute story at most?
Tales of Zestiria the X,Wouldn’t this be covered by one line saying ‘while supplies last’?
Tales of Zestiria the X,Never finished this - wasn’t really that interesting
Tales of Zestiria the X,"Took me 15 mins to think ""fuckers are milking this"" and switched it off;  don't know, or care, how it ended."
Tales of Zestiria the X,I thought about it and then I realized I would have more fun sodomizing myself with a Pepsi can than watching this drivel
Tales of Zestiria the X,I made it about 5 minutes in before realizing what it was going to be. Sounds like I made the right call!
Tales of Zestiria the X,wow another click bait tread/story.
Tales of Zestiria the X,I don't understand why this needed to be a documentary series.
Tales of Zestiria the X,One of the best classes in every first year of law school is this case
Tales of Zestiria the X,"Should have been maybe a 90 minute thing. The four episodes was far too much.

Eta: there’s a documentary out there called The Perfect Bid. It’s about a guy who gamed The Price Is Right. I want to say it comes it at like 70 or 80 minutes. And it’s far more intricate of a story."
Tales of Zestiria the X,It was more anti-climactic than dull….
Tales of Zestiria the X,"Just struck me as a privileged guy, unphased by an easy life, not knowing when to give up on a greedy idea."
Locust,"Don't think they could have found a pair of more appropriately colour-coordinated fighting stallions if they had tried for a hundred years. 

Like something out of a freaking Disney movie. "
Locust,Little birdie is like a god damn serial killer displaying his trophies. That's fucked up. 
Locust,"Climbing the equivalent of two everest's for a drink just to get scraned by a smug bastard Iguana 

What a life"
Locust,"As a programmer, I feel for the camera team's weeks of efforts to locate the bugs they were told to find."
Locust,"I'm cool with bats in the air, flying about, eating buggies and being vampires in their spare time, or whatever.

I am not okay with bats using their wing joints as freaky forelimbs and crawling about on the ground like something HR Geiger rejected as being too darn unsettling."
Locust,[deleted]
Locust,I'm just gonna pretend that the squirrel survived...
Locust,Could you imagine if locusts were carnivorous 😫
Locust,"That shot of the lion after it failed to catch the Ibix was incredible, where the camera pans out and all you can see is this lone figure of a lion stood still in the vastness of a dead world. Absolutely stunning."
Locust,That snake snuggling in the sand was absolutely adorable!
Locust,"I would be too afraid to talk or open my mouth, those locusts will just fly in by the thousands. "
Locust,"I like how most of the time they're so careful to not disturb the animals... then they get to the locust swarm and don't give a fuck. Played over a soundtrack that was like the white walkers attacking in Game of Thrones.

Also the mole was adorable. "
Locust,"So after they got done filming the locusts, did that UN group hit them with a tasty cloud of bug poison, and wipe them out?"
Locust,If only I knew how big Switzerland is.
Locust,"I'm getting to see this for the first time on a up to date HD-LCD-4D-somethingelseD TV, instead of my nine year old crappy Tesco Value TV.

Oh my. Oh *my*. This is pretty damn fabulous stuff. It looks realer than real life. "
Locust,"Thoughts:

1. The music during the locust scene was incredible

2. I don't at all understand how the horse fight ended. The white stallion missed a kick so he lost? All the kicks we saw were misses.

3. Bat v Scorpion was pretty creepy to watch, though the clarity of the footage filming such small creatures in a pitch-black desert is amazing"
Locust,"Jesus Christ, goshawk, that man has a family!"
Locust,"Got a big ""A Bug's Life"" vibe from those locusts!"
Locust,Holy shit that mole was brutal. Black hole sucked in the poor bug.
Locust,Hats off to those guys I wouldn't walk into a literal swarm of locusts. 
Locust,"They don't seem to be great at biting, maybe something for them to work on."
Locust,Chameleon made me jump 
Locust,Nope nope nope nope.
Locust,Sponge bird?
Locust,Is that watering hole footage lifted from the Africa tv series they did? 
Locust,You can tell hans zimmer was in Batman mode when he did the locust theme. The dark knight theme and the locust theme were very similar.
Locust,"My favorite part of this episode was the way Attenborough says ""jazz hands"" "
Locust,Brave men running in there.
Locust,Everybody do the locust dance
Locust,Oh fuck its lizards and snakes again. Although that snake does look nice and snug
Locust,What happens to the billion or so locust carcasses after they die? Some lucky predator is gonna have a field day. 
Locust,"Jesus, that bird having animal skewers is fucking brutal."
Locust,Boom headshot!
Locust,Isn't that butcherbird loggerhead shrike?
Locust,A giraffe could kill a lion with a single kick? That's pretty badass!
Locust,With love from Moses
Locust,"That beetle is doing some stellar yoga moves there. Very impressive headstand, my buggy friend. "
Locust,Damn cool that they could be on time to see a waterfall happen from rainwater and mud.
Locust,Second best episode after Islands. All have been brilliant to be fair. 
Locust,"anyone know what track is being played during the diary segment, immediately when the locust swarm is discovered? i don't see it in the soundtrack. maybe elsewhere? "
Locust,"I had a thought and feel free to tell me how I am an uneducated pleb... But we are spending billions trying to get to Mars (which I am totally behind let me add) and I hear we have a collossal amount of (fairly)  empty desert. Would it not be possible to colonize the desert in much the same way? Can we not build semi underground structures? (yes I know sand does not make a solid foundation) Is the ground underneath not more solid? For a planet that is running out of room, can we not spend the same kind of money right here on home planet? I know infrastructure would be an issue but is that issue not also present on Mars?         I'm talking out of my ass. But still curious "
Locust,Idk if anybody noticed but the footage of the various animals drinking water has been taken from another BBC production Africa. 
Locust,"So for all the beauty (and horror) of a plague of flying locusts, they all end up dead in the end?

Damn nature! "
Locust,Aah it's got an arm off
Locust,Fantastic episode as always!
Locust,"I'm not one to usually post on post show discussion threads but holy hell that locust segment...

The whole development during the scenes with the music becoming more tense then finally when fully developed and we see the swathes of flying locusts with the dramatic song playing really struck a note on me and the info on the swarm is mind blowing. 40,000t of food/crops consumed a day. Just wow."
Locust,"It kind of threw me off because the initial giraffe shown wasn't the same as the one that stomped the lion. I get it though, it's about the story so they have to edit a lot of footage together."
Locust,did they use Dexter's Theme song for the Butcher bird?
Locust,That little butcher bird belongs in true detective or something. Creepy
Locust,"fack, right in the noggin."
Locust,Definitely thought that lioness wasn't going to get up after the long horse crushed her ribs.
Locust,That scene where the mole just makes that creature.dissappear was creepy as fuck....
Locust,I had to stop after the first episode. I know I'm going to end up watching it all multiple times but it feels wrong watching on my phone instead of waiting until I get a 4k tv.
Locust,Is it just me or did the canyons about 10 minutes in look like the same ones that are shown in Westworld? 
Locust,Holy shit locusts are monsters. 
Locust,IT'S THE CIIRRRRCCCCCCLLEEE OF LIFE
Locust,> Vanishes as quickly as they came. 
Locust,i'm guessing this burrowing thing is Bugs Bunny?
Locust,"Took that scorpion long enough to finally strike, this is really suspenseful. "
Locust,For some reason I thought the plant itself had killed and then was displaying those dead animals. The bird makes more sense but was far less cool. 
Locust,"The giraffe kicking the lion was stolen footage. I've seen that same footage a number of times on youtube. Example here
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MX9GrMQoeNc"
Locust,[deleted]
Locust,"As a person from Arizona, I was happy to see the familiar view of the Sonoran Desert in this episode. "
Locust,[removed]
Locust,I just started episode 1. Is it just me or do most of the colors seem over saturated in a lot of shots? Lots of leafs and other shit is just way too vibrant. 
Locust,Looking forward to this one!
Locust,DID THE SQUIRREL SURVIVE?
Locust,"I'm having flashbacks to that bit in Little House on the Prairie where the locust swarms descend like a storm upon the fields of the pioneer family. 

That was a formative and horrible reading experience in my early childhood, and this is not helping me get over it one bit, Mr Attenborough, not one bit! "
Locust,[deleted]
Locust,"scintillating, every episode thus far, simply amazing. "
Locust,Dear god the locusts!
Locust,Didn't they already do locust swarms in Planet Earth 1 or am I thinking about something different. I could have sworn they already covered this type of event before.
Locust,So this is only going to have 6 episodes? What the fuck?
Locust,That was the most insane thing I've ever seen. Incredible.
Locust,[removed]
Locust,Anybody help me watch this out side the UK on mobile? 
Locust,Hey so I know this discussion was 6 years ago I’m so desperate does anyone know the song that played from 15:50 to 16:40 (ish)? For the deserts episode
Locust,"The minute I saw the black horse ride up with its posse, I knew shit was going down. And it. Was. GLORIOUS. "
Locust,[deleted]
Locust,Its all probably cgi or trained animals
Locust,"Someone tell me, was that a mouse or a gerbil on one of those spikes?"
Locust,"But whimsical music was playing, so its a good guy"
Locust,Hannibal meets Planet Earth. 
Locust,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRoVIpczcrY
Locust,"So cruel, had to do a handstand to funnel moisture off it's body just to get a drink. Poor guy."
Locust,You are right. that Iguana was whatever crunch crunch
Locust,They really had to... *commit* to it.
Locust,But it's adorable! When it gaped to eat that scorpion it looked like a little kitten!
Locust,They kinda reminded me of the Hollows from Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children.
Locust,Reminded me of the icecream man from legion...
Locust,A lion ain't got nothing on a giraffe. And that shameful run of defeat sums it all up.
Locust,[deleted]
Locust,God damn off screen deaths... Such a cheap show
Locust,"It probably did, probably was gone by the time they did those other shots. I get that they don't want to show death and gore, but it'd be sort of satisfying to watch one of these hunting animals actually succeed, pretty rare occurrence in these."
Locust,That's what I was thinking about.. Flying piranha!
Locust,New Disaster Movie idea. 
Locust,The clip of the producers running into the swarm at the end would be nightmare fuel.
Locust,They actually will eat meat if desperate
Locust,"Theres old folk myths that a dab of honey on the neck in a locust swarm can kill a man.

Im a little inclined to believe it"
Locust,Some of those lions were wearing collars.  Very fashionable.
Everyday Miracles,"The three television specials I make sure to watch every year around Christmas are Always Sunny’s “A Very Sunny Christmas,” Family Guy’s “Road to the North Pole,” and Trailer Park Boys’ “Xmas Special” (originally titled “Dear Santa Claus, Go F*** Yourself”).

On the less irreverent side, 30 Rock and West Wing (which OP included) always did a very nice job with their Christmas-themed episodes."
Everyday Miracles,The entire fourth season of Mr Robot is basically a christmas special and it's one of the best things on TV right now IMO.
Everyday Miracles,"Top 2 and I watch them every year:


The Honeymooners - Twas the Night Before Christmas

The Dick Van Dyke Show - The Alan Brady Show Presents


These are what Christmas tradition is all about."
Everyday Miracles,"Simpsons Roasting On An Open Fire, Marge Be Not Proud, Husbands Of River Song, Episodes 49 & 50 of Animaniacs, A Pinky & The Brain Christmas, A Rugrats Chanukah"
Everyday Miracles,I really love the White Christmas episode of Black Mirror.
Everyday Miracles,"Everyone in that show basically had the worst Christmas ever though, haha"
Everyday Miracles,Interesting.  I stopped a couple episodes into Season 3 (because Marvelous Mrs. Maisel and The Crown both had new seasons out last week.)  Maybe I should get back to it!
Everyday Miracles,"You must have stopped before the really fantastic episodes of season 3 (episode 5 onward), can't imagine you would have dropped the show otherwise"
Everyday Miracles,"I stopped for like a year after the Tyrell episode, definitely was a decision I regretted when I got back into it"
Everyday Miracles,">**The Librarians**: And Santa's Secret Run (Season1 Ep4) - *Hulu*

That's ""And Santa's **Midnight** Run"" :)  Bruce Campbell as Santa Claus, and the best damn explanation ever of why everybody's grumpy around Christmas."
Everyday Miracles,"Great work, thank you!  Might be worth x-posting to /r/christmas"
Daughters of Destiny,One Day at A Time? Really? 
Daughters of Destiny,It's a really good show 
Daughters of Destiny,Amazing luck that her daughter got the role.
Daughters of Destiny,Still pissed about her letting Jack go…..
Daughters of Destiny,Is this the sequel to I am Sam?
Daughters of Destiny,Remember when Spielberg's daughter got attached as director to some film and she said her name had nothing to do with it and how she had to struggle like everyone else? lol
Daughters of Destiny,I hope she is good. I would hate to see something with Kate Winslet ruined by bad acting.
Daughters of Destiny,I've gotta be honest. This stuff has never really been an issue in fields like acting. If an actor who's a draw wants to do a project with their kid or whoever... let em. Project probably wouldn't exist otherwise anyway
Daughters of Destiny,"It's the lying that aggravates more than the nepotism! Just say you wanted to give your daughter a leg up, ffs."
Daughters of Destiny,That’s a pretty ignorant statement.
Daughters of Destiny,"I mean her boobs were great in titanic.  I mean, her acting was great in titanic."
Daughters of Destiny,"It's an objectively true statement. Actors are allowed to work with their own kids. 

Whatever ""fairness"" is being breached never existed. Get famous enough to have pull and you can do a project with some friends or family. Welcome to life."
Daughters of Destiny,"Lol, you’re completely missing the point. But that’s cool!"
Daughters of Destiny,No I'm not. Maybe don't apply my words to a context other than the one I used them in?
Daughters of Destiny,"Really giant implications you’re missing. Again, very ignorant views on your part."
Daughters of Destiny,In this specific context? No.
Daughters of Destiny,“Kids of actors getting roles has never been an issue”. 😂
Daughters of Destiny,If you have to make up quotes I didn't say in my posts right above you then you are just admitting you are wrong
Daughters of Destiny,That’s called paraphrasing
Daughters of Destiny,"Thanks Tubi, your ad made my father start yelling at me because he thought I changed the channel!"
Daughters of Destiny,That's not how separation anxiety works Amazon
Daughters of Destiny,Bryan Cranston and Aaron Paul love being Walt and Jesse so much.
Daughters of Destiny,"The gimmick this year seems to be multiple celebrities in the same commercial. They open with one celeb, which doesn't surprise anyone, but the stinger is that they have another celeb in the same commercial!
  
Like all gimmicks, it gets old pretty quick. The ones that aren't relying on star power look good in comparison."
Daughters of Destiny,"If they don’t tell me what that QR code is for, I’m not fucking scanning it. Fuck right off with that bullshit."
Daughters of Destiny,Whatever happened to the guy who used to compile all the ads in one comment thread? I miss that.
Daughters of Destiny,Dunkin commercial has been the best so far. That’s not saying much.
Daughters of Destiny,Tubi: Home of all the weird movies your old off-beat video store used to carry.
Daughters of Destiny,Miller vs. Coors vs. Blue Moon was fun in the moment! ...but then depressing when you realize all the beer brands are owned by the same company
Daughters of Destiny,"Did they decide to save the funny commercials for the fourth quarter?  Sarah McLachlan in a Busch beer commercial, parodying her ASPCA ads was pretty amusing."
Daughters of Destiny,Recreating old movie scenes seems to be the new trend
Daughters of Destiny,"There ain't NO WAY in hell Snoop Dogg is wearing sketchers.

Also, is U2 behind all these damn balloons? I see...."
Daughters of Destiny,"Glad that dog ad stopped when it did. 

I was pretty scared there for a minute."
Daughters of Destiny,I liked that commercial with Adam Driver but I've already forgotten what the product was.
Daughters of Destiny,"Lol, Tuco in the Breaking Bad commercial. Was just missing Jesse calling Walt a bitch."
Daughters of Destiny,Did *not* expect that one to be a commercial for Remy
Daughters of Destiny,no fuckin way they made an unidentified balloon ad
Daughters of Destiny,That tubi menu got me (I thought something went wrong!) - though the transition straight into a Fox Nation commercial was really confusing
Daughters of Destiny,Is Rihanna pregnant again?
Daughters of Destiny,Why is Rhianna wearing boob armor?
Daughters of Destiny,Really thought they put Matt Damon in a shoe commercial. Not that it was a movie about shoes.
Daughters of Destiny,The farmer dating show seems like it would be an SNL skit
Daughters of Destiny,Keyboard Cat Lives!
Daughters of Destiny,"Anyone else remember when SB ads were designed to be funny and have some originality? 

Now it's find whatever celebrity is somewhat notable and play it safe."
Daughters of Destiny,Alicia Silverstone is still hot
Daughters of Destiny,"Fun to see Paramount+ with a new series of ""mountain"" commercials. (Not sure if this one was exactly Super Bowl worthy, but last fall they made one to bring back Key & Peele's substitute teacher character which I loved) [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEdNAzv1LD8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEdNAzv1LD8)"
Daughters of Destiny,BEWARE AMERICA. BUNNIES ARE COMING.
Daughters of Destiny,I’m glad i’m not the only one who thinks the cisco hold music is bangin’
Daughters of Destiny,That workday commercial. BRAVO
Daughters of Destiny,"I'm up 3 hours past my bedtime. You can't be messing with me like that, Tubi."
Daughters of Destiny,"Not a mobile ad!

Edit: It's for NFTs again!"
Daughters of Destiny,What is with these Dog commercials and hitting us in the feels lately?
Daughters of Destiny,"I’ll give the Workday “rockstar” commercial this, they had good enough judgement NOT to use Gene Simmons."
Daughters of Destiny,"So, uh, do we think the U2 commercial with the giant floating sphere was made before the whole China spy balloon thing? Because that's all that I was thinking when I was watching it"
Daughters of Destiny,"Was wondering why Tubi's being promoted so heavily. Turns out, they're owned by Fox."
Daughters of Destiny,Thanks for hanging out everyone! I included as many commercials as I could find!
Daughters of Destiny,So these commercials have been dogshit right?
Daughters of Destiny,Cisco hold music is the best
Daughters of Destiny,God bless WeatherTech for putting a normal ass boring commercial in the Superbowl ever year
Daughters of Destiny,Gambling ads 🤮
Daughters of Destiny,"god, that Dunkin Bennifer commercial entertained me more than it should've"
Daughters of Destiny,"I wonder if the new Indiana Jones movie will mention Mutt, or if Kingdom of the Crystal Skull is ignored."
Daughters of Destiny,That Rabbit Hole commercial was the scariest thing I've ever seen.
Daughters of Destiny,"Just got told to not do my taxes on national TV, what a world"
Daughters of Destiny,These commercials haven’t been very good.
Daughters of Destiny,I can’t believe it took us this long for a Bud Light commercial
Daughters of Destiny,That Busch Light commercial actually made me chuckle.
Daughters of Destiny,"Thinking ""VMS"" is the name of a Kpop band is a pretty fair guess, tbh."
Daughters of Destiny,TUCO! Popcorners win
Daughters of Destiny,Wait... are you telling me all these balloons were ACTUALLY from U2?!
Daughters of Destiny,"This is the same Matt Damon who was all in on crypto last year, and you're trusting him to go all in on an unknown basketball player???

Also we have too many damn stories about the beginning of Nike"
Daughters of Destiny,Best so Far... Will Ferrell bravo
Daughters of Destiny,Help the Red M&M!
Daughters of Destiny,"""We see you""

Me at home

""NO YOU FUCKING DON'T"""
Daughters of Destiny,Anything with Ben Stiller in it cracks me up for some reason. Loved that Pepsi commercial.
Daughters of Destiny,The Farmer’s Dog commercial hit close to home. Had to put our 16 year old dog to sleep last month.
Daughters of Destiny,Surely Pixel could've come up with better examples for photo editing besides removing people in the background fro 30 seconds?
Daughters of Destiny,"Was last year the one with all the crypto ads(Larry Sanders FTX)? Ah,how things change...."
Daughters of Destiny,Ngl that bud light commercial was extremely cute
Daughters of Destiny,"Lol, in the age of misinformation, nothing like advertising the ability to super easily edit and erase our photo histories on our phones"
Daughters of Destiny,"A rated R movie based on Air Jordans...

If I didn't just see the trailer, I would've never believed that premise was real."
Daughters of Destiny,"I know the night is young, but I'm still kinda surprised we haven't had a car ad yet. Usually we'd see at least one serious, monologue-y ad by now."
Daughters of Destiny,"So you shouldn't scan QR codes when you don't know what they are, but *you definitely shouldn't* scan a QR code to watch a roast of Mr Peanut"
Daughters of Destiny,They're killing it with these dog ads
Daughters of Destiny,Wait have all the UFOs been promotion for fucking U2
Daughters of Destiny,Elon Musk and Rupert Murdoch jumpscare
Daughters of Destiny,Always a treat to hear Kenny Loggins!
Daughters of Destiny,That Prime drink is DISGUSTING
Daughters of Destiny,"Wait, was that Michael Keaton?"
Daughters of Destiny,The Farmers Dog was a sweet commercial. Gotta go wake up my 14-year old dog and give her pets now.
Daughters of Destiny,"That Farmer’s Dog commercial really hit home with me. Had a 15 year old chocolate lab put down a few years ago and still not over it.

Really great commercial."
Daughters of Destiny,They're really pushing this farmer dating show lol.
Daughters of Destiny,Am I the only person who wishes Mr. Peanut had a mid-Atlantic/British Accent? The idea of him having an American accent always felt weird to me.
Daughters of Destiny,"Way too many ""Scan the QR"" code commercials"
Daughters of Destiny,Jesus commercial worst commercial of the night
Daughters of Destiny,"Giving how many signs and adverts, I see that Google is going hard at announcing the they snagged NFL Sunday Ticket away from DirectTV for YouTubeTV."
Daughters of Destiny,Rihanna dancing with a bunch of marshmallows has been kind of cool.
Daughters of Destiny,The RAM REV commercial did get a chuckle out of me.
Daughters of Destiny,"Okay, an ED pill mock commercial is funny, but it being for an electric truck is interesting..."
Daughters of Destiny,Tubi probably has the most effective one. I've never hooked my TV up to the internet and the remote was on the coffee table but it had like 7 people screaming at me for about 10 seconds lol
Daughters of Destiny,The Jesus ad is cringe AF. Can't have a pro cannabis ad but let's have a Jesus ad.
Lucifer,Tom Ellis carries this show on his back. If you so not like his portrayal i wouldnt stick with it.
Lucifer,"It's a procedural cop drama with a fantasy twist. Reduce your expectations. It's fun, but it's popcorn, not Tolkien."
Lucifer,Who's overrating Lucifer?
Lucifer,S1 takes quite a lot to pick up but overall it’s a good show.
Lucifer,"I find it improved the most in season 4 when it moved to Netflix. 

That said, it will never shake the goofy procedural romance thing, so if that's not enough, I don't think you'll make it that far."
Lucifer,"Lucifer's a weeknight procedural drama with the twist that the police consultant is the devil (and he's misunderstood). He has various powers, but only two that he consistently uses: asking people their true desire (which they are compelled to answer truthfully), or to allow someone to see his true face (which scares them). He is also invulnerable to mortal weapons, with an important exception that's a plot point.

It goes more into the lore an backstory of Lucifer later in the series, but fundamentally it was kind of setup to be a cop drama with a twist.

It mostly rides on the charisma of Tom Ellis and Lauren German."
Lucifer,"Its pretty good but I feel like it over stayed its welcome. Especially when it started using shitty soap opera tropes. 

Lucifer has an evil twin who wears sweaters all the time. Thats like 70s soap opera shit it cracks me up."
Lucifer,It's a procedural cop show trying to wear the skin of something more interesting.
Lucifer,"Season 1 and part of season 2 were pretty good imo but then it got repetitive and they tried to give break off stories to under developed characters I just didn't care about at all 

""DETECTIVE!!!!"""
Lucifer,"It's a terrible adaptation of an AMAZING comic book, I suggest reading that instead.  


(Not saying its a bad show, just a terrible TERRIBLE adaptation of the source material)"
Lucifer,"Honestly, for all the procedural shows with a supernatural aspect, Lucifer deals with the fact that's he's the Devil far more than most.  A lot of shows would just forget that aspect and run with a Sherlock clone and then have a little story part at the end to deal with him being Lucifer. But the show actually writes it into the cases and ongoing storylines pretty well. And it comes into play more and more as the show becomes more about that then the individual cases.

Just remember you're watching a network procedural show so the network built it to be a ""case of the week"" show and, like all shows built on that premise, they'll keep it episodic for as long as possible so new viewers aren't alienated by an ongoing serial that they needed to tune into each week to understand."
Lucifer,"It has its ups and downs. I felt the first and last two season were much better than the middle ones, and the final episode closed things off reasonably well.

If you're looking for badassery all the time (it has some, when Tom hulks out), it's probably not your kind of show."
Lucifer,its a fun show and i enjoy it but yeah you might want to temper your expectations. Its pulp fiction not high drama
Lucifer,Season 1 is great and thought out but the rest is drama rittled with plot holes
Lucifer,"One of my favourite shows tbh. It gets even more interesting, introduction of new characters, interesting story lines. But mostly it's just gonna be a procedural cop show. It does get brighter colour grading wise)"
Lucifer,"Keep watching until 9 and 10.. If you're not hooked after that, drop it.

Season 3 is a bit of a let down - too many fluffy (live, die, repeat) episodes. The rest I really liked."
Lucifer,"It is fun. It's nothing amazing, but it is a fun procedural about a devil cop. If you like Tom Ellis' portrayal of Lucifer, you are gonna enjoy the show, he is the driving force behind it.


oh, and season 1 is probably the most off in tone - season 2, they do a semi-soft reboot and embrace the campiness


Going into the 6th season, just know it was tacked on - netflix ordered it at the last minute, after they had filmed everything except the finale.


personally, I would not binge the show - just watch it when you want something fun and mindless on screen"
Lucifer,it gets much better than much much worse than great and then mediocre
Lucifer,"It's really weird. I fucking hate it. It is one of my favourite shows of all time. A lot of lost potential.  Tom Ellis is amazing and carried the whole thing. The humour is mostly great, in my opinion. Plus the soundtrack is really good."
Lucifer,This show started as a procedural but morphed into something else. I feel like it got stronger as it went along.
Lucifer,Good show
Lucifer,"S1 was amazing and that's how it got to highly rated

When the show was a metaphor about someone literally with a crazy power trip finally meeting someone they can't seduce or bribe and metaphorically coming back down to earth it was great

It was like an antihero story, the secondary characters get ""stuck"" and Lucifer uses his ""power"" (either literal or influential) to fix the problem, learning to be a better person in the process

S2 and s3 were alright too, they still had most of the elements that made s1 good but the quality drop is noticable, especially in the villain

Without spoiling too much, the main villain of s1 was a human, so it was quite tense seeing an otherwise godlike being who punches his way through problems be unable to get rid of someone who he could literally snap his fingers and kill

It was like a low-key good superhero arc

In s2-3, the villans are other being with divine power, and while it's a lot of fun to see callbacks and easter eggs about mythology and religion, being basically omnipotent means there can be a lot of deus ex from either side, which doesn't test the protagonist morally or in terms of powe it's just...how can I force fix this problem

From s4 it becomes a romantic and family drama and it is awful, I mean absolutely dreadful to watch

The audience focus was completely shifted to low iq viewers who cheer for big set pieces, cgi, and romance and it's honestly insulting

There are some good mythological reveals in the final season but the pathetic drama is so painful to watch that your reaction will be ""finally, something interesting"" instead of it being this massive payoffs after seasons of buildup

Bottom line is I rewatched season 1 like 3 times but that's about as far as I can recommend the show"
Lucifer,"found it rather bland, honestly. Like I'm tired of evil characters being good guys in disguise, that's hella boring, what about being evil and loving it, he's Lucifer for gods sake. And Tom Ellis constantly dead stare became a kind of an annoyance"
Lucifer,It’s reminiscent of the show Angel.
Lucifer,"I loved almost all the episodes and I am glad netflix picked it up for the last two seasons. Of course there are some parts I wanna poke my eyes out but hey, it's not as bad as it could be. 

The last two seasons are nice to finish out the show. 

Also, remember lucifer is a DC hero so you saw him on Legends of Tomorrow with Constitine."
Lucifer,unfortunately the devil aspect of it is more of a gimmick half the time. i think when they moved to netflix the show started focusing more on the myth aspect. but for the first seasons it's basically just a cop show and it happens to have a supernatural twist to it. it'd be like if something like csi had a team member who is psychic
Lucifer,I love that show
Lucifer,The will they wont they bullshit gets extremely irritating but other than that i liked the show
Lucifer,"Lucifer is in essence, a direct sequel to the events of what will be S2 of Netflix's Sandman. The show unfortunately is a police procedural, which is somewhat lame. It barely replicates only some of the material it's based on (characters created by Neil Gaimen, Sam Kieth and Mike Dringenberg). But if you watch S1E4 of Sandman, same Lucifer, same Mazikeen. There is also (on I believe Legends?) a crossover between Tom Ellis's Lucifer, Matt Ryan's John Constantine (also a show that didn't make it past one season) and the rest of the Arrowverse cast on CW)

Netflix's Lucifer owes its existence to Tom Ellis, otherwise the show would have stayed canceled on Fox."
Lucifer,"I thought it was okay, until about Season 2. From my viewpoint Lucifer is hyped up by a lot of women and gay men because they think the lead dude is hot."
Lucifer,My Southern Baptist family watches it it must either be good or bad
Lucifer,It is one of the better shows of the last 20 years start to finish.
Lucifer,"It's crap. 

It's especially crap when you realise the actor who plays Lucifer is perfectly cast the same way Constantine was but this strays so far from the source material and ends up being this insanely gay show that has will they won't they romance thrown into it for the entirety of the show and more often than not, the show falls flat on it's fat arse. 

Watch it and get pissed off with every direction they go in and mishandle."
Lucifer,As far as crime procedurals with a whacky side kick go it's pretty good but don't expect anything more than a crime procedural with a whacky side kick.
Lucifer,"I could not get into another cop show where the gimmick is to partner a cop with a gimmick partner (android, woman, ghost, dog, vampire, devil, socialist, Elf, etc).  Gave it 2 episode and then moved on."
Lucifer,"This being *supposedly* based on the brilliant Lucifer character from Neil Gaiman's ""The Sandman"", I was incredibly disappointed and repulsed by the fact that they had the nerve to turn the rich source material into a stupid cop procedural.

To illustrate for people who don't know the comics: 
Imagine you had the rights for a Gandalf series - and then make a cheap Jackass clone where he gets punched in the balls all day and has explosive diarrhea. Only less funny."
Lucifer,"I found him to pretty, Lucifer should be scarred by millennia of fighting"
Lucifer,It fades in quality significantly towards the end…it wouldn’t be the first time it has happened after the two leads become romantically involved. Tom Ellis is also significantly better than the surrounding cast and you start to notice more and more as time goes by.
Lucifer,Season 1 is significantly worse than the rest. I skipped most of it and read a recap.
Lucifer,"Depends.

If you want a show that's comics-accurate (Lucifer from The Sandman comics gets bored of running Hell and decides to open a bar in LA) then it isn't for you.

If you want a generic police procedural that happens to feature a stripped-down version of the comic character as a sidekick then go for it."
Lucifer,"It is mindless fun but not great.

If you want a good ""devil"" show, try Evil.
Give it until Season 2, Season 1 is a bit all over the place."
Lucifer,Its an entertaining time killer.  That's it.
Lucifer,If you're a pervert and love that kind of guy humor you will love Lucifer.
Lucifer,"The latter.

Go watch Good Omens instead."
Lucifer,Trash
Lucifer,This Lucifer exists in the same universe as Neil Gaiman's Sandman if that helps
Lucifer,It's ok. Not great not terrible.
Lucifer,The actor playing Lucifer is great but I grew bored of the procedural nature of the show and stopped watching somewhere around Season Two.
Lucifer,I liked it at first but MAN did it go off the rails...
Lucifer,I hate it when shows about eternal beings becoming private investigators in become unrealistic.
Lucifer,"It’s one of those shows where some seasons are fantastic and some terrible. There’s no inbetween. 1, 2 and 4 are the best of the lot."
Lucifer,"Depends on what you want out of it.

As a procedural detective/cop drama it is probably better then its peers.

If you are familiar with the character from Vertigo/DC it is a bit dissapointing.

THAT Lucifer scammed his way into making his own creation as a way to thumb his nose at his Dad.  THIS Lucifer (from the show) has the power to know your deepest desires.

The two don't really compare."
Lucifer,"If you have seen Castle, it reminds me a lot or that, just a different theme. Have reasonable expectations and it can be a fun watch. Don't expect to come away with a more profound view of life or anything though."
Lucifer,"S1 and maybe 2 were ok, then there was a season with the smallville guy which was terrible. then there was the season with inbar lavi which was really good, then it went back to being bad from what i heared."
Lucifer,Both
Lucifer,It’s a show to watch when you just want to shut off your brain and go with it. Watched it all the way to the final season then got tired of Netflix
Lucifer,"We finished binging it recently and enjoyed it. It’s not too-tier drama by any means, Lucifer’s story arc ends up being satisfying and enjoyable."
Lucifer,"It's a stupid premise with terrible acting, but the lead guy is hot and has a British accent so it gets to remain on the air. 

Not a good show, check out any other show on IMDB's Top 250 TV Shows instead"
Lucifer,"It’s a “fun” show and I watched it mainly for the main character. I found the detective less interesting and her acting a little stiff. Lucy, though, is quite fun."
Lucifer,"It had slow episodes, but I greatly enjoyed it overall.

But then . . . I like ""big secret reveals"", whether it's Lois Lane finding out Clark really is Superman, M.J. finding out Peter is Spiderman, or the characters in Lucifer finding out . . . ""oh no, he wasn't lying, he really is 'the' Lucifer.""

Some of the reveals make the in-between slogging worthwhile.

I also like ""redemption"" stories.  And some of the side characters ""Lt. Dan"" and Mazikeen . . . have some real turn arounds.

Plus, (I know, I know, it goes against pretty much the entirety of Christian teaching), but I like the idea that God holds out hope for ALL of his children, even Lucifer."
Lucifer,I liked it a lot. Sometimes the whole “I’m Lucifer” and no one believes him gag gets old but has some nice pay offs.
Lucifer,My wife and I enjoyed the entire series.
Lucifer,I don’t normally like shows with angels and demons. But I liked this one.
Lucifer,"It's one of those shows that I'm glad I watched. It had a satisfying conclusion after a satisfying set character developments.

Even the Patricia Helfer stuff. I like her, but I'm just sick of seeing her in everything. In this one, she had a great story.

Keep in mind that the final season was produced by Netflix, so it had a slight change of tone and some production changes. They managed to keep in on the rails though.

The best thing is that they stayed true to the in-world rules."
Lucifer,"It started good when Lucifer and the demon were actually kind of threatening, but they soon became all creampuff and dumb."
Lucifer,"It's weird, and full of magical nonsense thinking but It has some very entertaining episodes.  The actors do a great job playing in this silly show.  I loved the George Thorogood and TLC.  Musical episode cracked me up."
Lucifer,It’s basically just a cop show with some supernatural elements. If your not a fan of detective/ cop shows then you might have a hard time enjoying it. The actor who plays Lucifer is the main draw of the show. The episodes are mostly self contained unlike a lot of modern sci-fi/fantasy shows. That can be a plus or minus depending on what you enjoy.
Lucifer,I liked Reaper better.
Lucifer,Good Show falls off after Season 3 but still enjoyable
Lucifer,"First few seasons weren't bad, but it quickly got worse. It quickly became noise in the background while I played PC games. I had to force myself to watch the last season just to finish it out."
Lucifer,"it's more like Librarians meets Charmed, if that makes sense, and I liked both of those shows and therefore liked Lucifer, it's not everyone's taste and it doesn't have to be lol"
Lucifer,"It’s fun, pulpy, silly, and melodramatic at times. It’s perfect for a glass of wine and a carton and Ben and Jerry’s."
Lucifer,"It’s a crime solving dramady with the devil…. A less witty, less funny version of psych."
Lucifer,You should probably stop watching it then.
Lucifer,"I watched it a bit and honestly I can't really even tell you the basic premise of the first season. 

Like all I remember is the black angel brother knocking up the woman and Lucifer going back to hell. I don't even remember anything about the female cop"
Lucifer,Later
Lucifer,"Vertigo Lucifer, it is not."
Lucifer,"Just going by the marketing, imo, it like the Spartacus of vampire tv shows."
Lucifer,"It’s a good entertainment, campy, sexy, has suspense and emotion. I loved every minute"
Lucifer,Not sure if you were just looking for a new time filler show but I recently started watching Elementary on Hulu and it has been great! Cop dramas are all over the place but I think this was a really good take on a modern Sherlock Holmes.
Lucifer,You got about as far as I did.
Lucifer,Fantastic first 5 seasons. Last season sucked
Lucifer,"I don't think anyone would ever describe this show as overrated. I liked it, but it was generally hated on here."
Lucifer,It’s fun.
Lucifer,"It's a damn masterpiece but looks like it was made on a budget at times, but the story is great and Tom Ellis is perfect for the role."
Lucifer,Watch it and make your own decisions.
Lucifer,It depends. Do you want to fuck Tom Ellis?
Lucifer,"If you think Lucifer being a good guy and owning a club sounds interesting, then I guess you'd like it."
Lucifer,"It's an insanely unremarkable show with an absolutely fantastic lead who is killing it. You're watching it to see Tom Ellis chew the fuck out of every scene he's in.

The second lead is so boring that I've watched four seasons and couldn't tell you her name. Chloe, maybe? Doesn't matter. She's a cardboard cut out of a human being.

Later there's a WAY more interesting romantic interest but she gets ignored because she's not the *intended* love interest."
Lucifer,"Awful. if you've read the comic, unforgivable."
Lucifer,"It's okay, and then it's kinda great, and then it's barely clinging on and just limping home."
Lucifer,"I'd call it a romance show over anything. If you can deal with 6 seasons of will they, won't they, they did, sike, now will they, won't they. Continue."
Lucifer,It's just Castle but with the Devil instead of a crime writer.
Lucifer,"It's probably my favorite show of all time. I'm maybe on my fifth or sixth rewatch. Despite Reddit's protests, it was one of Netflix's best performers."
Lucifer,"Its pretty fun, but its not that deep. [Even Lucifer himself would agree.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXIRt0uG3D0)"
Lucifer,"It’s nothing special, if you don’t like it, don’t continue."
Lucifer,"It's been said in here a dozen times, but I'll say it again-

Tom Ellis might as well be Atlas with how hard he carries that show on his back."
Lucifer,"I liked it well enough for most of it's run. But I did binge it after it was all over.

It will drag in places early on since it started on network TV and thus has a lot of episodes to get through."
Lucifer,"See the comics about it, they were the original version and are so much better it’s not even funny"
Lucifer,"It’s a TV 14 show about Satan. Don’t expect to much, it’s not going to be greatly compelling or complicated. But if you like the lead actor and maybe feel good episodes then you’re in the right place."
The Worst Witch,"She was a force of nature in GOT. 

https://youtu.be/9TQLEurtSFk"
The Worst Witch,"Without [Bella Ramsey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bella_Ramsey) anymore, I really can't say I see the point..."
The Worst Witch,I didn't even know there was a new version of The Worst Witch. The movie in the 80's was a favorite of mine as a child. [Tim Curry in it was iconic.](https://youtu.be/PUhuPn8_d0Q)
The Worst Witch,"Hopefully it means we'll get more Hilda soon

I remember catching and liking a few episodes of the old HBO adaptation of worst witch, how's the Netflix show?"
The Worst Witch,I liked the old series.  I'm 30 so the new show wasn't as magical as the old series I watched in my childhood years.
The Worst Witch,"It's okay. Not fantastic, but enjoyable. Bella Ramsey is a big part of that, though. Kinda typical CBBC fare.

As for *Hilda,* I'm wondering what the hell the holdup on S2 is, given that they already premiered two episodes of it at [the NY ICFF film festival](https://nyicff.org/programs/hilda-2/) back in February. I get that doesn't mean the whole season is ready to go, but it's been almost two years since S1."
The Worst Witch,"well netflix definitely doesn't allow people to view episodes when they're ready as opposed to dumping the whole season (anime fans have a big beef with that since watching a show when it's released is preferred and netflix jail leads to people pirating it and/or ignoring it and Hulu doesn't bother) .

Also  a lot of production has been disrupted by the virus"
The Worst Witch,">Also  a lot of production has been disrupted by the virus

But not so much with animation, since animating is something someone can do remotely on a computer at home.

Netflix dumps seasons, but they dump shorter ones than broadcast would week-to-week. And if *The Dragon Prince, She-Ra PoP, Kupo and the Age of Wonderbeasts,* and the *Tales of Arcadia* show can keep more or less to two half seasons each year, asking for a half season (13 episodes) of *Hilda* within two years *seems* doable to an outsider.  Clearly, something else may be going on, particularly since *Hilda* is an international production, and it's not like Silvergate Media is the same as Dreamworks."
The Worst Witch,"Again I have no idea how the unique animation style behind Hilda operates 

I do know that a lot of anime has been delayed partially because of use of physical materials and partially because of being international with physical materials having to be shipped from Korea and china (where they outsource part of the animation work) and partly due to issues with recording voices(usually done in groups)

Most American series don't seem to be as heavily effected, possibly because a lot of it is CG?"
The Worst Witch,">Paradise PD is maybe the worst show I’ve ever seen

I agree.  But somehow I couldn't stop watching it.  What is wrong with me?"
The Worst Witch,Yucko should not be allowed to write TV shows unless he’s on it in full costume.
The Worst Witch,Mad how this 4 seasons (and more? I dunno) while a good show like Inside Job gets shitcanned after 2.
The Worst Witch,"If we're talking about the worst shows we've ever seen, [Work It](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work_It_(TV_series\)) is still, by far, the worst show that I remember being allowed on TV."
The Worst Witch,Just wait til you see Farzar. Truly horrific. Paradise at least has some hilarious moments but that other one is a waking nightmare.
The Worst Witch,"It's like someone saw Family Guy and said I can make a less funny show. That show was Drawn Together. Then someone saw that and said I can make a less funny and more disgusting show.  That show was Brickleberry. The makers of Brickleberry just decided to make the same show with cops instead of Park Rangers. That show was Paradise PD. 

It's like the Friedberg and Seltzer of television."
The Worst Witch,"Paradise PD, Farzar, Hoops, Chicago Wine Aunt, Brickleberry: all incredibly terrible, bottom-of-the-barrel shows. It's amazing these get made and pushed out"
The Worst Witch,"I actually liked Brickleberry, probably I was the only one besides the creators who watched that show. 

But I agree, Paradise PD is terrible"
The Worst Witch,need higher hair
The Worst Witch,"Cancel tuca and Bertie, more seasons of paradise pd!"
The Worst Witch,I actually think paradise pd is super funny!  So is brickleberry.
The Worst Witch,"I've never seen either one, but the only reason they renew shows is if people watch them. I guess people are watching them."
The Worst Witch,"
TIL that Yucko the clown makes animated series.."
The Worst Witch,"Eh.  I enjoyed it, but the last season wasn't as good.  Not everything has to be ""God tier TV,"" and sometimes one just wants to catch a buzz and enjoy some lowbrow potty humor."
The Worst Witch,"It’s not junk food tv, It’s search through your fridge and cupboards multiple times until you decide to just eat something you definitely didn’t want but would rather eat anything than be hungry tv. 

The show is “meh” but it’s something to tell your brains to shut up for a few hours while you try to think of the next tv show or video essay to fill your distracted time void of a brain."
The Worst Witch,"this is just in, netflix can actually see the number of people watching their shows, redditors opinion =/= everyones opinion

not that i liked that show btw, its just how it is."
The Worst Witch,"Well that's just like, your opinion man"
The Worst Witch,Yet it's very watcheable
The Worst Witch,"I actually like Brickleberry. I know it's extremely low-brow, but I thought the humor was good.

Paradise PD is proof that censorship can not only be a good thing, but also a requirement. It was mean spirited for the fucking lulz and didn't care. If you think Family Guy and South Park rely too much on shock humor, it is this show's lifeblood.

And Farzar is just ""what the fuck can I get away with on streaming platforms."" They're trying to make genitalia a running gag on the show. Not make jokes about it, just literally show boobs and a dick and tell you to laugh at it."
The Worst Witch,"Lol, I dunno what's wrong with you, I thought Paradise PD was great. And I laughed at Brickleberry. And I'm waiting for S2 of Farzar. Yes they're coarse, disgusting etc, but I like 'em."
The Worst Witch,Vile series.
The Worst Witch,"That's interesting.  I don't mind edgy stuff (fave show is always sunny) but even my wife, who's slightly less forgiving, didn't mind watching paradise pd in the background when I had it on

I think that for me, enjoyment came from being shocked at how far they were allowed to push it

Are you pretty conservative in what you find funny/ find appropriate would you say?"
The Worst Witch,"No lies here. 

It's not funny.

It'll probably get another season and a movie or some shit..."
The Worst Witch,"You can't believe that anyone could find it funny.  That is my biggest brickleparadise complaint.  Its not funny.  Like a shyamalan movie: just awful and not universally understood as such.  Amazing how one persons con-man is anothers superhero. Thing is, I am right and they are wrong.  Agree to disagree?  No, its bad, you are an idiot."
The Worst Witch,netflix guages shows based on how many people finish the season as compared to how many start the season
The Worst Witch,"Spoiler alert: show gets veiws = they keep it. You watched those trash shows, you contributed."
The Worst Witch,You're just a bore obviously
The Worst Witch,"So I guess I am in the minority again. I don't agree with Velma being bad and have always liked Brickleberry. I've probably seen every episode of Brickleberry at least 3 times. I watched Paradise PD and enjoyed it. And I am looking forward to Season 2 of Farzar.

Has nothing to do with being a rebel. I just don't care if others think its trash. Looking at the ratings on IMDB, it seems others agree with me at least with Brickleberry and Paradise PD."
The Worst Witch,90% of everything Roger Black has ever done is garbage.
The Worst Witch,"I kind of enjoyed brickleberry or at least it had some good moments, watched a handfull of paradise pd episodes, and holy shit it really is awful.

Someone else mentioned farzar and not even touching that shit."
The Worst Witch,I tired both and did not make it 2 minutes
The Worst Witch,There are many shows and movies that love to do that nonsense of having no likeable characters. But this is a cartoon its bound to be dumb so I don't care if they are likeable.
The Worst Witch,Try watching a single episode of Velma.
The Worst Witch,All of Yucko’s stuff is complete trash. But it’s the lowest of low bar and brings in the 14 year olds and probably costs peanuts to make.
The Worst Witch,Believe it or not there is one that is even worse. Australia made a shownoretty similar called pacific heat. It was horrid.
The Worst Witch,Hey S1 brickleberry was pretty good
The Worst Witch,"It's like they think the grosser or more vulgar something is, the funnier it is."
The Worst Witch,"I watched Brickleberry, Paradise and Farzar and for the life of me, I can't tell you why! I complained through and about every episode!

They are all absolute garbage, but you just can't stop hate watching..."
The Worst Witch,"I thought Brickleberry was ok, but PPD is just meh. ,,, , ,"
The Worst Witch,Big Mouth is another disgusting show Netflix has allowed to live a long time.
The Worst Witch,"Every series ( Farzar, Brickleberry, Paradise PD) with those guys is garbage."
The Worst Witch,Miles better than Velma but yeah it sucks ass.
The Worst Witch,Those memories are repressed for a reason.
The Worst Witch,"I heard the term ""Hate watching"" when trying to explain why Velma got a second season @ HBO"
The Worst Witch,"Guilty pleasure is all.

Its a very stupid show that allows you to turn off your brain for 23+ minutes and have some very dumb low-brow fun."
The Worst Witch,"This is Big Mouth for me.  It's 99% annoying trash, I don't know why I suffer though it for that 1%"
The Worst Witch,Maybe Because it featured the song “Pump up the Jam”?
The Worst Witch,Yeah. It was bad. But I’ve seen every episode. Some twice.
The Worst Witch,"I wonder the same thing. I made it even worse by rewatching the previous seasons right before the new seasons came out. 

I can't do this again lol"
The Worst Witch,https://youtu.be/x3SxEOvAOEg
The Worst Witch,Yucko wrote this comment
The Worst Witch,What? That Roger Black?!
The Worst Witch,Inside job was fantastic.
The Worst Witch,Or the fact that Neil Gaiman had to rally his fans just to get the Sandman renewed.
The Worst Witch,I'm still mad about them canceling Dark Crystal after one season.
The Worst Witch,"Not defending paradise pd at all but season 2 of inside job felt a lot weaker than 1 to me in a lot of parts. I actually loved how strong inside job started, s1e1 felt almost perfect for a first episode and left me wanting more. The character cast was pretty good too except maybe I would have had either the mushroom or Bobby Lee’s character play a more straight man to balance out the cast? It felt crowded having two sex addicts/casual drug dudes and some of the part 2 storylines were not too great 

I wish it’d gotten at least another season or two though, I feel like a lot of the issues would have been lessened or ironed out over time"
The Worst Witch,Because this costs $5 an episode with no actual talent getting lucrative deals.
The Worst Witch,"I raise you Heil Honey, I'm Home!

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heil_Honey_I%27m_Home!"
The Worst Witch,"God. I ashamedly watch 2 episodes of farzar. First episode was horrendous. I think I watched the second to redeem myself, thinking there must be some redeeming quality.

There wasn't."
The Worst Witch,I hated Paradise PD but I really liked Farzar. I thought it was just dumb toilet humour at first but it’s also pretty creative
The Worst Witch,drawn togheter wasnt bad.
The Worst Witch,"wtf. no. Drawn Together is a gem, that show is great."
The Worst Witch,"Drawn Together is unironically the funniest show ever made. Other shows are obviously better in other respects, but nothing else has quite hit the same heights in that respect since."
The Worst Witch,"And with farzar they just said ""fuck they'll give us money for anything, have this turd"""
The Worst Witch,Nice analysis!
The Worst Witch,"same reason mtv became what it was at least till the days i fully stopped giving a fuck about it, people like these shows."
The Worst Witch,Higher hair please
The Worst Witch,There's a damn good reason Tuca and Bertie was cancelled.
The Worst Witch,"This just in, shows like this are much, much, much cheaper to make. I'm just pulling numbers out of my ass, but if this show costs 5 million a season, and pulls 5 million views, and Sandman costs 50 million and pulls 25 million views, Sandman cost more per eyes on the screen."
The Worst Witch,"“proof that censorship can not only be a good thing but also a requirement” really tickled me 😂 I’ve not seen it, but I’m intrigued in what could be so bad someone says this"
The Worst Witch,"Right?  Bunch of fuckin' prudes up in here. Sometimes you gotta turn off your brain.  I almost didn't watch Farzar because ""everyone"" said it sucked.  Those people were wrong, and I eagerly await S2."
The Worst Witch,Most people don't like Paradise PD so I don't know if there's something wrong with *OP*.
The Worst Witch,">Velma got a second season

Oy, you idiots need to stop watching things ""ironically"""
The Worst Witch,"I checked out the first two episodes because I was convinced it couldn't be *that* bad. But no, horrible horrible stuff. Did not return the following week."
The Worst Witch,"Big mouth started off pretty good and but started to show cracks when they leant heavily on Krolls characters. Coach Steve, the obnoxious blonde girl, and the old decrepit hormone monster never should have had as much screen time as they did but no one loves his own mediocre characters more than Nick Kroll"
The Worst Witch,So does Cunk On Earth
The Worst Witch,I wish this could be the top comment
The Worst Witch,Yeah. Not kidding
The Worst Witch,"Price is a huge factor. If Sandman cost the same per session as Paradise PD, then it would have been result renewed."
The Worst Witch,Sandman was awful.
The Worst Witch,"This one makes the least sense too. Like, you have the puppets and decor, season 2 would cost half the money to make compared to 1!"
The Worst Witch,We never got a season 2 of Inside Job it was season 1 released in 2 parts.
The Worst Witch,"stupid take, 99.9% of the people who mentions this show didnt even watch it, they found out about it in some lazy watchmojo video or something, not defending the show or its idea but it doesnt make sense to bring it up in this discussion."
The Worst Witch,I just find it hard to believe they expected that to last more than an episode.
The Worst Witch,"Honestly, that’s a hilarious premise that could have been done well."
The Worst Witch,Yeah it was a little crude but otherwise well done. The early 2000s was like a golden age for adult animated shows
The Worst Witch,Pretty edgy but I loved it.
The Worst Witch,I fucking loved drawn together but I haven’t seen it since it aired when I was in high school so I have no idea if it was actually good or not.
The Worst Witch,"Strongly disagree, but humor is subjective. Hence why Paradise PD exists."
The Worst Witch,"Hard agree. I like family guy, but drawn together was amazing. Coined so many memes in my circle of friends."
The Worst Witch,The weirdest turn is now MTV is producing all those Taylor Sheridan shows
Ozark,">The final shot of the series has spawned debate on whether Jonah killed his parents along with the private investigator.

What? Who is debating this? Why? I shouldn't be surprised considering how media illiterate so many people are but surely that ""debate"" wasn't common enough that it bears mentioning."
Ozark,"I just watched it. I don think they even needed the gunshot. marty's look at mel like ""what did you expect?"" sells it."
Ozark,dont understand how there was any debate of ambiguity to that ending either...
Ozark,i watched the final season a few months ago and i honestly can't remember how it ended
Ozark,They get away with it and continue to earn money as criminals. The family is too far in to go back to a normal life. Perfect ending.
Ozark,the ambiguity comes from whether the ending was shitty or just plain ass
Ozark,What about Three? He was left all alone. Not sure why he was even a character.
Ozark,"I love the ending. The entire show is about >!the Byrds selling their souls to stay alive. And sure enough, they do. Ruth still had a heart and ultimately she wasn’t ruthless enough to win!<."
Ozark,"I found it hard to believe that a kid 1 episode ago hated both his parents enough that he was ready to travel with his grandparents, whom he barely knows, all the way to north carolina to live with them; would all of a sudden be willing to murder a private detective who came forward with evidence that his parents murdered his uncle, whom he thought highly of and liked very much."
Ozark,"I loved that show but kind of hated that ending. Especially that they killed Ruthie. I feel like one of the main reasons they ended it that way was to leave an opening for a revival series sometime in the future, maybe ten years from now. It didn’t feel like a true ending to the series, it felt more like a good stopping point to be picked up from at a later time. Like, “ And the Byrds kept getting away with it. Until one day… “ THE BYRDS ARE BACK! OZARK SEASON 5, COMING IN 2033"
Ozark,Yeah it was just bad. I'm tired of these shows only being good for the first season or two.
Ozark,"The wheels fell off this show so hard, the last season was a joke"
Ozark,The ending was shit.
Ozark,There is nothing I hate more than when the series leaves the ending up to viewers' interpretation.  At least they got this part right.
Ozark,Someone's trying to create a Sopranos type myth around a bargain brand show. How sad
Ozark,[removed]
Ozark,Wait that was the last episode ever? I'm so stupid wth I was waiting for season 5
Ozark,spawned debate = a guy posted this theory once while high and we're just gonna sort of run with it.
Ozark,"There is no ambiguity because it was just as terrible as the rest of the final two seasons.

Ozark was a weird show, it had such a great collection of characters and incredible storylines and then had other parts that just so stupid and poorly thought-out.."
Ozark,It’s the first I’m hearing of it
Ozark,"Such a great show with such a disappointing ending, though I kinda blame the whole Covid putting a halt on things and Netflix rushing to end the series. It could have gone at least another season I reckon."
Ozark,"I find this happens too often when a movie or show tries to be subtle or imply an ending, months later it's a blur."
Ozark,"Gunshot, fade to black."
Ozark,"Agreed. The son and Ruth did a 180 right at the end. As if Ruth, who is always untrusting and cautious would suddenly put herself in that position. And the son (spacing on name) who hates his parents would suddenly murder a detective for tjem"
Ozark,It did seem like the writers often forgot about him and then in the final season timeline they realize he's supposed to be graduating high school about now.
Ozark,"As much as people bitch about how stupid and cliche the fairy tale happy ending is they sure do bitch more when anything ends in a different way.

I don't really get why people had a problem with the ending. It was very true to the characters. Guess they just held Jonah up as their weird 'no contact' savior and got mad that he didn't leave the family. It's like they didn't actually watch the show. Jonah moved into the motel so he could be involved in the same shit as his father without them infantilizing him and taking his work away. No shit he comes back to kill the PI. He never wanted to leave. He only did so they would be forced to learn to respect him as an adult rather than as the 8 year old they remember."
Ozark,"Personally, I think Ruth sucked and don’t understand why she’s so adored. From releasing Ben from the mental institution then blaming everyone but herself when he gets himself killed, exacting her revenge without giving a shit about the consequences for others (even though her stupid cousin and Darlene practically begged to get killed by the cartel), preventing the Byrds from laundering money in the casino, which not only makes Wendy and Marty (who she disliked) a target to the cartel, but even herself and people she’s supposed to like or at least don’t hate, like Jonah, Charlotte and Rachel. I don’t really see how she had the moral high ground over the Byrds."
Ozark,"The only thing I can think is that Jonah knew if the cops started investigating his parents then his own money laundering software would be found and he’d lose all he’d worked for, too. So it was trying to show that he was just as selfish and evil as his parents when it came right down to it.

Still think the ending was trash"
Ozark,"If you remember, their son was always on board with everything Marty was doing. He wanted to learn the business and setup his own cleaning company. He learned a hard lesson on what it takes to be in the drug cleaning business when he found out his uncle was killed by his mom. I think the last episode shows what he was always willing to do for his family, and he finally made the decision to go all in."
Ozark,"If you ignore the context of the car crash leading up to that then maybe yh it might be unbelievable, but I think that event for him would’ve definitely had an impact for his change of heart"
Ozark,"I don't think the show ended on an ambigious note, but I definitely feel the same about it being open for a revival lol. It just felt like the usual break point in Ozark. Now, I'm not saying that the show NEEDS to continue. Just that it feels like they left their chances to it open.


The ending left me lukewarm, but I really loved the show as whole. And honestly, as much as I liked Ruth, she was walking on eggshells by the time she was killed off. And it just served to show how Byrds are willing to ""sell their soul"" or do anything to survive, like another user here mentioned."
Ozark,You literally had to click on the article to be spoiled? lol
Ozark,Spoiling? After they say in the article SPOILER ALERT?
Ozark,Are you fucking daft?
Ozark,I'm the opposite. I loved it especially >!how Ruth was dealt with and how the family all came together at the end.!<
Ozark,How do you think this show should have ended?
Ozark,"lol; It's been 297 days since the last episodes were released, even if someone waited until the show ended before starting to watch it, they only had average slightly over one episode a week to have watched it all by now."
Ozark,In my opinion the final scene put an interesting thematic cap on the entire series and somewhat salvaged what was otherwise a sloppy final season.
Ozark,"you're right, but also i kinda just lost interest in the show. i wanted to finish it but it wasn't like something i was really invested in. i was probably dozing off while watching the finale."
Ozark,"...life it seems will faaaade awaaaay, drifting further everyyyyy daaaaay"
Ozark,">As if Ruth, who is always untrusting and cautious would suddenly put herself in that position

What? I got completely different picture of Ruth when I watched the show.. She was constantly doing dumb shit, DESPITE being warned that the cartel is extremely dangerous by Marty. She reminds me of the ""Cyclist puts stick in own front wheel"" meme.

She is untrusting, but still doing self destructive and dangerous shit all the time."
Ozark,Not to mention this was about 45 seconds after Jonah said he's going straight and getting out of crime lmao
Ozark,"I won't argue Ruth, but it makes perfect sense for Jonah. Marty and Wendy were finally free. They were all leaving that world and starting a new life. Then comes Mel with his self righteous cause to put a huge dent in that plan. Jonah wasn't having it. He wanted out of the Ozarks, and Mel wasn't going to stop him. He snapped. Like all the other times except he actually went through with it this time."
Ozark,"I just found it to be underwhelming.  It’s not that it was a downer ending.  My favorite TV ending ever is on The Shield, and it doesn’t get much more downer than that.  It’s that it wasn’t terribly interesting and didn’t feel like adequate payoff after the show’s journey."
Ozark,"I also didn't like how she's basically the new local mob boss and gets zero muscle around her. When the threat level got real I would have kept a sniper in the woods across her home, easy to see anyone come to her land."
Ozark,That's valid. I guess I just hated the finale and how poorly written it was.
Ozark,"The car crash pissed me off too. The van flips over 18 times but no one has a concussion, no one has broken bones, no one needs to go to the hospital, everyone's fine. Even still, a change of heart to commit murder on an innocent person? I don't think so."
Ozark,"I personally would've preferred it if they had cut to black after Marty and Wendy noticed the back door was busted open. It's kind of ridiculous that Camila was too stupid to realize that they were being played by the Byrds, so ending it with an oh shit moment would've shown that the cartel wasn't fooled and that Marty and Wendy aren't as smart as they thought they were and would've brought everything full circle."
Ozark,"I just wanted an ending that feels reasonable. The idea that >!Jonah murdered Mel instead of simply taking the cookie jar from him and vas leaving him with nothing is wildly inconsistent with Jonah's character!<. It left a stench of ""we wanted to end it in a cool way even if it will feel forced""."
Ozark,"*Getting lost within myself,* 

*Nothing matters, no one else*"
Ozark,"Ruth does not get enough credit for causing 100% of her own problems like all the other characters. She's easily the series 'favorite character' so shes is positioned like a truth-teller/victim, but she gets into shit because she is impulsive and stupid. Great character but shes remembered in sort of a weird way."
Ozark,"Yup. Ruth is just as self destructive as the rest of her family, only unlike them she actually has a brain and should know better. That she does, yet still manages to fuck herself over at every turn makes her the least sympathetic for me."
Ozark,"Idk I don’t feel that way, she was always trying to prevent her cousins from doing dumb shit. Didn’t Marty even say “you’re too smart” or something the first episode?"
Ozark,"I thought that was intentional. He can't escape it now that he's a murderer, something his parents were trying to prevent throughout the entire series."
Ozark,"I think people hated that they were bad people all along. Like the show centered around this all American family who just so happened to clean money for drug cartels. They painted the drug lords as merciless assholes when actually Marty and his whole family were a bunch of assholes that would do anything to stay alive and keep making money. 

When you see Jonah turn into someone on the same level as a drug lord, people just hated that. They wanted them to be able to walk away and go back to the all American family."
Ozark,"Not only is it pointless, it sucks all the tension out of the season. You know none of the Byrdes are in real danger the whole time because the crash hasn't happened. So you're waiting for this explosive crash that ends up doing absolutely nothing when we all wanted it to kill Wendy."
Ozark,The son was emotionally stunted like Marty and he almost kills early in the series too.
Ozark,Concussion can cause erratic behaviour
Ozark,"But the Byrdes didn't get away with anything. The trail of their crimes has been been littered with the bodies and ruins of those around them, and now their own legacy and lineage will forever be tainted with their crimes."
Ozark,Jonah wanted to shoot someone since season one. He was always a little psycho
Ozark,"He might've said something like that but he also warned her about the cartel early in the show. That didn't stop her from plotting to steal their money with her dad, expanding her cousins and Darlene's heroin business and releasing a ""crazy person"" from a mental institute.

And all of those actions resulted in cartel hitmen killing some people close to her."
Ozark,"You may be right, I have a pretty bad memory 😂 I just remember her death seeming unbelievable to me"
Ozark,"People get attached to characters they like and assume the character will make the right choices. Ruth was just as dumb as every other character. She pushed her luck to the bitter end, like everyone else."
Ozark,"You should definitely watch it if your a fan of Bateman. I wasn’t really a fan of his until I watched the show.

The shows about a guy (Bateman) who is forced by the cartel to launder money, so he moves his family to the Ozarks where he can take over a bunch of small businesses and clean the money. The characters are very unique. Laura Lenny plays his wife, and she’s a great addition to the show.

The shows really about the people living in the ozarks, and less about the cartel side of things imo. The town is like a character in and of itself. 

The show also doesn’t glamorize violence, and give everyone heroic deaths. It really shows how anyone can be wiped out at any time, and it won’t be cinematic."
Ozark,"It’s fine.

It gets more ridiculous as the seasons go on as they have to continue doing a series of escalating impossibilities.

That doesn’t mean it’s not enjoyable though due largely to the performances."
Ozark,"Lol
I'm sorry, it's just funny because you have no idea how addicted you'll get to it - the writing and character development is UNREAL

Yes. It is very much worthwhile."
Ozark,"Just watch it. Let the show explain itself. 

Then again I do not watch trailers and prefer going into a series or movie cold."
Ozark,"I enjoyed the first two season but checked out in the middle of the third. 

I personally find shows like that exhausting so it’s not necessarily an indication of bad quality"
Ozark,"The cast is fantastic, everybody acts the shit out of every line.


But the show starts with a very grounded reality, and part of the charm is the plot moves along by every character doing what you might do in their heightened situation. It feels very real, and smart. 


But then the stakes get higher, and the side characters get sillier, and the main character’s goal posts change…and it loses the magic. I’d still say it was a good watch, but it definitely tries to be breaking bad in the second half and fails. So go into it knowing it ain’t perfect"
Ozark,"It's fun enough if you're into pulpy crime shows with gratuitous sex and violence, but I found it very much like a discount store Breaking Bad. Every element just feels so amped up to maximum ""edginess"" jus for the sake of it.

But there's a lot of great performances and fun characters, and if you like that kinda thing it's at worth giving a shot."
Ozark,I couldn't keep going with it. I have never seen a show that alternated so much between awesome and stupid. Too many seasons.
Ozark,No. It’s one of the most overrated shows
Ozark,"Yeah it's worth watching, especially if you're already a fan. It's a crime drama about a businessman who starts up ventures to launder money."
Ozark,"It's pretty good for a while, but may leave you unsatisfied at the end. 

Bateman plays a money manager who ends up involved with a drug cartel and runs to the Ozarks to hide out and then starts a new money-laundering operation. 

There are obvious parallels with Breaking Bad: a seemingly ""regular guy"" who's actually kind of smart (in his own way) and gets in over his head with the drug trade. And like BB, a lot of the show is about the main characters trying to escape from one fire only to end up in another one. 

I found the last season fairly unsatisfying for a number of reasons (that I won't spoil here). It's a good ride until then, but it doesn't stick the landing anywhere near as well as BB did."
Ozark,"The ending was rough and some the bad guys were lame but the show had some exciting moments too. It also has one of the best acting performances I've seen in Wendy's mentally ill brother introduced later. But starting around the third season you really start to ask questions like why the byrdes arent dead, in jail, or witness protection? Why is Wendy such an awful character? What is Marty's motivation?"
Ozark,yes its really good but bad ending
Ozark,"If you watched and liked Breaking Bad, then watch Ozark.

If you haven't gotten through at least 8 episodes of BB, try that first.

If you gave BB a good shot and are sure you don't like it, don't try Ozark."
Ozark,Pretty solid show overall but it kinda relies on character deaths as it’s only way to shock the audience. Gets kinda repetitive after a while and the aftermaths of deaths are usually wrapped up in an episode or two so they don’t really have any real effect on the series besides shock value. Last season can be rough with the finale itself pretty underwhelming
Ozark,"Really good. Worth a watch for the third season alone, even if the final season wasn’t really a win for me, the first few seasons are good enough that I didn’t regret watching it"
Ozark,"Yea I'd say it's mostly really good. Worst part about it is the ending kinda sucked imo, but aside from that I was pretty hooked up to that point"
Ozark,Yes! So good.
Ozark,don't watch ozark weighing it's the new breaking bad it's a thousand times better!
Ozark,"Up until the last about 4 or 5 episodes yes, after that it just fucking sucks and ruins any hype I had for the show"
Ozark,None of the responses on this thread will sway or change the preconceived notions that you already have for the show. It doesn't need another viewer if you can't even put in the minimal effort to do any requisite research on Wiki or IMDB.
Ozark,"It is AMAZING!!! Incredible writing. Just beware, it's hard not to binge it!!"
Ozark,"It really isn't.  

The first episode is awesome and then season 1 lags for a long time and gets great near the end. Seasons 2 and 3 have both excellent parts and really bad parts. It is a head scratcher how great and bad those two seasons can be at times. 

Season 4 was just lousy.

So overall it really isn't worth it."
Ozark,"It’s good. Didn’t need as many episodes as it had as it’s pretty one note, but there are worse shows to spend your time on. Bateman is very good; if you like him you’ll likely enjoy the show."
Ozark,"There will be a certain character who will appear in later seasons who is, hands down, one of the most annoying and frustrating characters I've ever had the displeasure of seeing in a show I actually like. 

Great performance from the actor; absolutely terrible character who almost made the show unwatchable."
Ozark,Darlene is my favourite character.
Ozark,Only you can answer that question...Try and get back to us after you've finished!!
Ozark,"Yeah, it's a good show"
Ozark,"fan of JB, then YES

how have you not watched it yet?

the show is all his baby, its incredible, like almost Breaking Bad"
Ozark,One of my all time favorite shows. There were really no off episodes- every ep served the storyline and they were all consistently engaging.
Ozark,"its good allaround, i guess its just a crime drama with a bit noir style of storytelling which kinda adds tempo and unpredictability, overall its kinda tiny world but with strong individual performances."
Ozark,"It's fine. Some people compare Ozark to Breaking Bad , but I don't think they are similar except for the story about money laundering.
If you like story about messed up family and money laundering you should give it a try.
Cast's performance are great."
Ozark,I loved the show start to finish! Highly recommend 😄
Ozark," Jason Bateman stars as Jason Bateman. 

What's not to like."
Ozark,Laura \*Linney - and she's fabulous.
Ozark,First two seasons are great; last two are solid but *lower your expectations* 🥲
Ozark,It’s very obviously trying to be “Breaking Bad”. But first couple of seasons were enjoyable enough.
Bella and the Bulldogs,Would love some bloopers
Bella and the Bulldogs,Feels like it just started. I can't believe it's over already.
Bella and the Bulldogs,Have Nick Offerman and Bella talk shit to each other since we missed out on Bill fighting with Ellie
Bella and the Bulldogs,I don't want to spoil any future stories for myself. Can I play the video game after season 1 ends?
Bella and the Bulldogs,You guys would definitely check out Hot Ones most recent episode. Its Pedro Pascal himself!
Bella and the Bulldogs,If they don’t reenact the musical alternate ending I’m gonna be very disappointed.
Bella and the Bulldogs,"I wish they had more in depth videos about what goes into making each episode. For the final few seasons of Game of Thrones, HBO released like 20 minute long clips about the costumes, the stunt choreography, the special effects and nearly everything else behind the scenes. It have great insight into all the work that goes into each installment."
Bella and the Bulldogs,so mixed with the podcast that's \~3h of TLoU content on Sunday. fucking eh.
Bella and the Bulldogs,It's been a gift watching these two people star in sci-fi fantasy shows. I can't wait to see what they do next in other movies.
Bella and the Bulldogs,Gotta get my fix!
Bella and the Bulldogs,Guess I'll be watching it while silently weeping. It's something I guess. 😭
Bella and the Bulldogs,"I like the actors, but after watching the first two episodes I had to turn it off. The screenplay and dialog are too formulaic and predictable. In fact, all story lines appear to be lifted from: A Boy and His Dog, Dawn of the Dead, WD, or any other zombie post apocalyptic narrative. I found incredibly tedious to sit through. Again, the acting was fine."
Bella and the Bulldogs,Cool advert
Bella and the Bulldogs,"I kinda thought they'd expand more on the characters that we love, there's a whole backstory in the days before Joel meets Ellie that I really wanted to see...

9 episodes and 1 was a dlc episode that came after the main game was out for a year. 

Bit of a shame considering Last of Us 2 has even less Joel."
Bella and the Bulldogs,"The last of us and the mandalorian are the same show.

Prove me wrong"
Bella and the Bulldogs,[removed]
Bella and the Bulldogs,[removed]
Bella and the Bulldogs,Thats good. I feel like I wanted something akin to the House of the Dragon specials they released each week for these episodes. At least we get this.
Bella and the Bulldogs,"People should watch Prospect with Pedro Pascal. 

His dialogue in that movie is great."
Bella and the Bulldogs,Or some Joel and Ellie fake deaths like when they die in the game.
Bella and the Bulldogs,"apparently pedro pascal did his l.a. accent a lot while on set, as did his other cast members. would like to see that as well"
Bella and the Bulldogs,The Laughs Of Us.
Bella and the Bulldogs,I feel like 10-12 episodes would have been perfect. 9 is on the short side.
Bella and the Bulldogs,1st game shouldve been 2 seasons tbh
Bella and the Bulldogs,"For sure can play Part I since it will end where season 1 ends. And who knows maybe you’ll want to play part II afterwards anyway, not a spoiler if it’s ultimately going to be the same story :). I think it’s a story worth experiencing via it’s original medium first."
Bella and the Bulldogs,You better end up playing Part II fairly soon because I feel like you’re not gonna be able to avoid spoiler talk after season 1 ends
Bella and the Bulldogs,"Yes, season 1 is just the first game including dlc. It's a great game, if you've ps5 or pc you can pick it up cheap enough if you keep an eye on sales. Otherwise you got the ps4 remaster which is still really good"
Bella and the Bulldogs,Play Part 1 as it won’t spoil anything and it’s an incredible game. Don’t play part 2 if you don’t want the rest of the show spoiled
Bella and the Bulldogs,"""You're smart"" - Pedro to Sean"
Bella and the Bulldogs,"I just watched that episode, it was amazing. Pedro Pascal is so damn charming, I just want to hang out with him"
Bella and the Bulldogs,"[Listen to the podcast to scratch a bit of that itch](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/hbos-the-last-of-us-podcast/id1660320068) \- I believe they are all over 40 mins long and this includes Druckman, Mazin and it is hosted by Troy Baker. Can't get more inside than that!"
Bella and the Bulldogs,"Jo and Mal from the Ringer-verse are also doing an interview/recap with Craig Maizin and Neil Druckman, so an extra 2 hours there if you want"
Bella and the Bulldogs,"Pedro has to do a project with Nathan Fillion where they can play brothers. Christ, their speaking voices even sound alike."
Bella and the Bulldogs,Maybe they’re saving that storyline for later seasons to help even out joel time
Bella and the Bulldogs,"They both have different show title names and are also set in a different universe.

Damn, that was easy"
Bella and the Bulldogs,Why would anyone care about proving you wrong? Demomstrate that you're correct or your assertion is to be laughed at and dismissed.
Bella and the Bulldogs,"I mean they're literally different. 

Dumbass."
Bella and the Bulldogs,"This apple and this orange are the same thing.

Prove me wrong."

Bella and the Bulldogs,"It would be a little *too* on the meta-nose.

But I would have loved to see Pascal killing Baker while being unable to talk. Voiceless at it were.

For those few not in the know: Joel in the show killing the actor in the show (Buddy Boy) that played Joel in the game (voice + motion caption)."
Bella and the Bulldogs,Is this a spoiler? What the fuck bro
Bella and the Bulldogs,Oh mah gahhhhhhh!
Bella and the Bulldogs,They did make 10 episodes. HBO then combined the first two into a movie length premiere because they thought it worked better dramatically and because otherwise most of the pilot would be the 2003 flashback.
Bella and the Bulldogs,It is 10 with the double length of the first episode.
Bella and the Bulldogs,Having 9 episodes where two of them are around one hour and 20 minutes is what I’d prefer
Bella and the Bulldogs,"How? The game takes about 15 hours to complete, most of which is gameplay. At most this could have 10 episodes instead of 9, but there is not enough story for 2 seasons."
Bella and the Bulldogs,Gotta love how a mildly unpopular opinion gets you downvoted to -44.
Bella and the Bulldogs,That’s too much. 12 episodes I could get into. 2 seasons is overkill.
Bella and the Bulldogs,"Unfortunately it’s not on PC until the end of this month, and it’s $60 so probably won’t be cheap for a while."
Bella and the Bulldogs,The stuff that he says isn't even *that* funny but he's so goddamn charming that Sean is losing it and I'm laughing just as much.
Bella and the Bulldogs,"Hope so, they nailed the actors and Tommy needs more screen time, I want to know what Joel did to survive, if they can tell a new story about characters like Bill and Frank they can tell something new about the actual focal characters."
Bella and the Bulldogs,The easiet gottem of all time
Bella and the Bulldogs,"OK, you grumpy folks..The same guy, Joel, take a little child along several seasons. The child has superpowers that nobody has, and Joel has no purpose in life, till he meets the kid. The purpose now is to take him to some enigmatic place with some enigmatic people. Once he delivers, they want to take the kid down.

THE SAME SHOW.

You do not agree?

ok, how about this:

The last of us is the prequel. Ellie develops some symptoms like greeny face and longevity. Also she can be in touch with mother nature. in season 7 Joel get ill and die, and Ellie manage to take an eye of Joel, the last part not contaminated by the fungus, so she can bury him next his brother.

She place the eye ina sferic metallic ball and hit the ground. Finally she cant say goodbye and keep the ball as an amulet.

Years later, season 35, Ellie use the rounded eye of Joel, stored in a sferic ball of steel, to get Joel DNA and to revive him. They need berskar because the weekness of the skeleton, so they go to mandalor, and train as mandalorian.

It turns out Ellie is shrinking, so the ears seem to be huge, and  greening step by step.

As the reconstruction of Joel is a succes, an evil force try to make more clones,  But they need more Joel DNA.

They take Joel, kill him and get all DNA they need. They  turn the startup into a success, and start a special program of mass production on clones!

Once she finds out, she get mad about and convince a new Joel  to destroy the  Clone factory with all the clones but the last one. Ellie get injured and unable to speak again, and almost a fern by now.

The bush with ears and Silver-helmet go for the gallaxy looking for the misterious people and the enigmatic place, while grogu -she doesnt feel like a girl any more and changed her name- plays with the sferic-steel ball, that contains the last piece of his friend. They travel again and forever.

The end"

Bella and the Bulldogs,"In case this is serious, no it’s not a spoiler lol. Just happens in video games a lot"
Bella and the Bulldogs,"It’s a joke, bro. They both die a lot while playing the game."
Bella and the Bulldogs,"Games been out almost 10 years.  If you missed it that long, that's on you."
Bella and the Bulldogs,Let's put a pin in that.
Bella and the Bulldogs,"Yeah as people have pointed out, when you take out all the slow sneaking, puzzle solving, and random combat out, the actual plot of the final chapter of the game is only like 15 minutes"
Bella and the Bulldogs,I would have liked a little more of the connective tissue between sections of the game. I think we probably could have gotten 12 or 13 episodes while giving us little asides during their trip to KC or the three month gap on their way to Colorado.
Bella and the Bulldogs,"The show doesn't need to be constrained by the game, as they showed with episode 3 (an example i liked) and introducing the Kathleen character (an example I liked less)."
Bella and the Bulldogs,By using the episodes to show more of a relationship between Joel and Ellie. 8 episodes so far and 2 of them were basically standalones.
Bella and the Bulldogs,"well they already added stuff into the show that wasn’t in the game, so they could’ve just idk, wrote more into the storyline.

i dont care either way but its not like they couldn’t have done it."
Bella and the Bulldogs,They could have easily flexed their writing chops and added more episodes. Develop relationships properly to have better payoffs instead of introducing a character and killing them off the same episode.
Bella and the Bulldogs,"Yeah, not two seasons, but I think 10 or 11 episodes would have been better. The quality of TLOU isn't in the Joel and Ellie story alone. It's that they exist in a lived in world. They spent an episode on Bill and Frank. Everyone loved it. It had a very limited connection to the game, outside of them existing in the game. They gave KC residents two halves of two episodes. They gave the DLC an episode. They opened with that couple living in the middle of nowhere. It's the world building naughtydog did that gave TLOU a foundation to tell a great story.

Give me an episode on ish and kyle getting people together, and their downfall... Hell, that's easily two episodes with ish writing on the wall to no go inside, and wandering off closing the episode.

I think they really missed the best part of the game by hiding an Easter egg for ish.


I also dislike how little time we spend with Joel and Ellie just talking, but I don't see how that extends episode count vs making episodes unbearably longer."
Bella and the Bulldogs,"Doesnt have to be just the game look at ep3 and the whole bill thing, couldve ran s1 to the end of the city or even joel getting injured if you want to add some story beats to the cannibal arc. Point being it doesnt feel like joel and ellie have the same relationship they had in the game, even abit forced at times, and thats not going to make me care when xyz happens in a s2 based on a game that hit pretty 'meh' to begin with.

And thats a mild take, imagine those that are still seething about xyz happening at all"
Bella and the Bulldogs,"The last ep could have been 2-3 eps easy. And with one episode left, it really doesn't feel like there's enough room to finish the story properly. (I hope to be proven wrong, but expect it to be rushed)

And theres a bunch of stiff that could have been in there, that just isn't.

There was easily enough content for 15-18 eps"
Bella and the Bulldogs,"Was thinking the same, but they can be angy and enjoy their subpar seasons 2 & 3, god forbid 4

S1EP3 best itll ever be"
Bella and the Bulldogs,"Well get ready for that with 2nd game, i could see two 8 ep seasons doing just fine for the first"
Bella and the Bulldogs,No one's reading all that. Don't watch if you don't like it🤷‍♂️
Bella and the Bulldogs,[removed]
Bella and the Bulldogs,"I played the game...and the fakeouts are very obviously fake outs, otherwise the story ends"
Bella and the Bulldogs,"That’s why I was having a hard time seeing people say ep 8 & 9 needed to be longer when they saw their run times 

Like, take out all the gameplay and combat and plot wise I can see how the creators said we don’t need a full hour"
Bella and the Bulldogs,Yeah. They did that entirely anyways. Imagine being ok with them not spending at least 1 episode on it. Or injected as 5 minute set pieces each episode.
Bella and the Bulldogs,"Kathleen was fine, I guess. I just find it weird that they spent two episodes with her, Henry, and Sam. Henry and Sam have an effect on Joel and Ellie, sure, but a lot of Ellie’s development comes from her time with David. We saw a lot of it, but something was missing. I don’t know what, but if KC can have two episodes, there’s no reason they couldn’t flesh out David & James more, or alternatively expand on what the ending is. 43 minutes is short to wrap it up, regardless of if there’s so much gameplay."
Bella and the Bulldogs,"It's both really, episode 3 was great but looking at the season as a whole it feels like each episode is an ""arc"" and it's missing some connective tissue. There's a lot of talk about how the game is about 14 hours anyway and they can use all that gameplay time to flesh out other characters, which is great, but it's during the gameplay that Joel and Ellie's relationship builds. The show is still really good but I think they could've struck a better balance with another episode or two."
Bella and the Bulldogs,"The rest of the game from this point is under 30 minutes even including all the gameplay, stopping to listen to the recorders, reading the notes, etc. So they could cut to an actual play through of all the remaining content and it would only fill half the time slot, being rushed isn’t a concern. (I checked a play through on YouTube for the actual runtime. 28 minutes from David’s death to the end credits.)"
Bella and the Bulldogs,"who says i dont like both of them? 

i just say that are the same story, with the same principal character."
Bella and the Bulldogs,That's why they're saying they would be funny post show behind the scenes bloopers. Not something seriously used in the show.
Bella and the Bulldogs,"8 could have been longer. We definitely missed out on David and Ellie having to fight off infected , that would have been a great 10 minute segment in the show as it was important in the game"
Bella and the Bulldogs,"Episode 3: universally lauded for all the extra material added by the show runners.

Episode 9: let's just rush through it as fast as possible because it was all gameplay."
Bella and the Bulldogs,"The show has fallen into the trap if ""its a zombie apocalypse with no zombies"" 

A brief aside where they encounter infected, like the tunnel section of the game, is kinda needed for world building.

That and a few more moments of actually showing us the relationship they've forged. (Including the DLC, instead of showing us in the present, was absolutely a mistep).

And a little more space to let the ending breath, and possibly even a moment to set up the next beat, wouldn't go astray.

But there's not the runtime for that now.

I dunno. I guess we all find our tomorrow night how they go with the finale."
Bella and the Bulldogs,"You say this as if this isn't an entire subgenre of content - a kid and a father / parental figure. You'll find a lot of other shows and movies like this, I think you're basing most of your opinion on the fact that Pedro acts in both and both are airing simultaneously."
Bella and the Bulldogs,"Craig Mazin has a podcast with Neil Druckmann where they explain that things like that are combat for the game. They work for the game. It would not necessarily translate for a show. Repeated infected would get old, fast. See: TWD. 

I also would watch the show for what it is, and not always compare it to the game. It keeps the core story but does its own thing

I’m grateful for Craig and Neil’s adaptation/translation"
Bella and the Bulldogs,Both episodes were very highly reviewed. Episode 8 has the second highest user score of the series and received largely positive critic reviews. It’s not like it got trashed
Bella and the Bulldogs,"I never said that at all.

And the scene I mentioned isn’t repeated infected and a slog of a scene. 5-10 minute scene of them fighting off a hoard would have absolutely worked on the show."
Bella and the Bulldogs,"The combat section with David was what causes him to eye her. How the fuck David saying Ellie has a ""violent heart"" even makes sense when he and the audience didn't see her engaging in violence in the show?"
Bella and the Bulldogs,Whenever I think of cannibalism I think of prions.
Bella and the Bulldogs,Chopped into little pieces for sure. Just not how he hoped.
Bella and the Bulldogs,"i loved the ""what's this?"" the guy goes ""venison""  


and then you immediately see them pulling in the dead deer that hasn't been cut up yet. i was watching with my girlfriend and she didn't immediately pick up on that ahahahahah"
Bella and the Bulldogs,"Her performance was so good and when David was on top of her, I kept wondering how that actor who played him continued on when she let out that scream. Holy hell, I know it's acting, but I don't know how he did it"
Bella and the Bulldogs,[removed]
Bella and the Bulldogs,easily the most CATHARTIC twenty minutes of tv I’ve seen in decades. Died when Joel called her baby girl.
Bella and the Bulldogs,"it's weird how 2 IPs from the same developer went into completely different paths, Uncharted went the easy cash out route but The last of Us actually put some effort into making it a thing on its own, Great Job, hope more game adaptations like this get made."
Bella and the Bulldogs,"I would be dead so fuckin fast in this universe. When Ellie had her gun on the preacher I was like “aw come on he’s a nice guy, he’ll help you!”

And I had somehow not made the connection that they were eating people. When Joel knifed that guy and beat the other one’s head in I was like “Wow Joel is being a real jerk”"
Bella and the Bulldogs,Bella Ramsey tv line performance of the week. Calling it.
Bella and the Bulldogs,"Pedro Pascal episode absolutely killed (quite literally too) in that interrogation scene, which is one of the most badass scenes in the game for Joel"
La Fiscal de Hierro,Wut
La Fiscal de Hierro,Could in theory be good for AAA but they half ass everything so much and have half assed the Marvel collab stuff  in particular. Disney has practically begging to raise their platform and the best they've done is some 10 minute pre show matches that they barely put on TV.
La Fiscal de Hierro,I need this so badly
La Fiscal de Hierro,"First roadside assistance, then car insurance, and now TV shows? I hope I can watch this with my existing AAA membership."
La Fiscal de Hierro,"I don't get it, it's a reality fight show or a scripted show?"
La Fiscal de Hierro,Finally we begin the marketing lead up for everyone's most anticipated marvel legend *El Muerto*
La Fiscal de Hierro,"Fucking hell, am I having a stroke?"
La Fiscal de Hierro,"aaa is the biggest professional wrestling promotion in mexico, and it appears they are getting a tv/streaming show"
La Fiscal de Hierro,"If the ""Lucha Underground vibe"" comment is accurate you expect a mix of both. The wrestling would be pretty traditional done in front of a live crowd sort of thing, but the outside the match stuff would appear much more like a scripted tv show likely with fantasy/comic elements for the characters and storylines."
La Fiscal de Hierro,"They've been filming Marvel matches with Lucha-fied superhero gimmicks for a few years. They introduced a Marvel belt at Triplemania, but there is no telling what the storyline stuff will be like. I'm guessing it'll be Chikara meets Lucha Underground."
La Fiscal de Hierro,Is it? Now I prefer AAA but I'm pretty sure CMLL is the biggest professional wrestling promotion in Mexico given its existed for 89 years.
La Fiscal de Hierro,This looks a bit like a G rated Lucha Underground.
La Fiscal de Hierro,Looks fun. The marvel inspired luchador costumes are pretty decent.
La Fiscal de Hierro,"AAA has fumbled the bag so badly with the Marvel Lucha Libre stuff that I'm not expecting too much with this, I hope it works out but they've treated it like such an afterthought despite using some of the most famous characters on Earth."
La Fiscal de Hierro,"I remember being so excited to watch Lucha Underground, but then I saw just how boring the wrestling part of it was. I’ll still check this out but I’m not expecting anything different."
La Fiscal de Hierro,u/savevideobot
La Fiscal de Hierro,Is this satire ? I can’t tell lol
La Fiscal de Hierro,Bruh lucha underground was a GEM. It was either so blatantly fake that it was beyond hilarious or it was them actually smacking the living shit out of each other. Either way it was a spectacle to behold.
La Fiscal de Hierro,Pretty sure I saw it somewhere described as trying to be Lucha Underground
La Fiscal de Hierro,How can you find LU boring from a wrestling standpoint?
La Fiscal de Hierro,I think I find all wrestling boring. Throwing someone to the ropes and doing moves which look weak just isn’t entertaining to me. I would rather watch a wrestling anime like Ultimate Muscle.
La Fiscal de Hierro,"So then you don't like wrestling. That's ok as it's not for everyone. Lucha Underground had a hybrid comic book/telenovela style of presentation for their vignettes. Since it was taped and had a special studio for the wrestling, the in ring product was heavily edited and could seem a little disjointed at times but the action itself was great"
La Fiscal de Hierro,it really sounds like a Puccio family copypasta
La Fiscal de Hierro,"""inspired by War and Peace"""
La Fiscal de Hierro,What a title.
La Fiscal de Hierro,The Rings and The Crown Meet the Spartans at The Kingdom of Heaven During the Hunger Games
La Fiscal de Hierro,House of The Cobra
La Fiscal de Hierro,She's one of my favorite writers so I'm looking forward to this.
La Fiscal de Hierro,it's like a bot took two recent relevant things and created a television show
La Fiscal de Hierro,Harry Potter and The Rings and The Crown Meet the Spartans at The Kingdom of Heaven During the Hunger Games
La Fiscal de Hierro,"2 of your major complaints have more to do with your inabilities than the show itself.

Your inability to read subtitles has nothing to do with the show. It's like an ESL person complaining there's too much subtitles to read when watching The Community.

Equally, your inability to distinguish between the women has nothing to do with the show. Granted, I couldn't tell couple of them apart as well in the beginning (but this happens a lot when I first start a show) but it didn't take long until I could tell them apart and they really don't look that similar.

&#x200B;

I did not get the sense that it promised us an adventurous girls trip. This seems to be an assumption you made then got fixated on? They are a bunch of girls who go on a vacation together; partying, doing drugs, walking around town, chilling on a boat etc, sound about right to me. This isn't some fantasy show where they go on to slay dragons.

Cancer and doing challenges with your best friends? To me it was obvious from the get go that it's a show about self-discoveries. But it really doesn't matter whether my assumption was correct or not because it has nothing to do with the quality of the show.

&#x200B;

I don't think it's even important to know who has cancer. The writer even told us this by showing us how the show could end if it is revealed that a specific character had cancer at the beginning of episode 6.  I would have been ok even if it remained vague. This isn't a mystery ""find the person with cancer!"" show where you go back and see what clues you've missed.

&#x200B;

edit: wording and grammar."
La Fiscal de Hierro,Couldn’t have said it better myself
La Fiscal de Hierro,"I agree completely. And to add: this is a VERY rare show that has moments that actually makes me ""real"" laugh (like I'm in on the joke and not laughing AT the characters), and had a great portrayal of friendships, and one of the LEAST fake drug experiences. I truly loved this. Even though I binge watch a lot on Netflix, I tend to play some game after a bit in background because there's a bit of irritation at taking too long to get to the point, but in this case I enjoyed the journey, and loved it. I also love that it didn't feel like anything else to me. 

I do admit two things though: one, that for first 2 episodes, I kept confusing the 2 married women, but it was easy to sort their faces as I got to know them better; and two, that i did very mildly try to guess which had cancer, and first thoughts were correct, but it thankfully really wasnt treated as a mystery or important to story. 

I think I'll rewatch in original Spanish versus the dubbing to better get idea of tones and voices of each woman."
La Fiscal de Hierro,"Yes! The way I see it OP didn't get the show because they went in with completely different expectations. There is nothing to get or expect from it but just enjoy the time you have with the characters. Most of the time I just wanted to be there, sit next to them and talk about nothing and everything and that's the beauty of it. 

Though i do admit that 3 of the characters looked extremely alike with their head shaven but that is in no way a minus point and more of a fun observation."
La Fiscal de Hierro,"I really, really hope this is the slam dunk it sounds like, because I love Janelle Monae but almost everything she's been in as an actor has been not good. Basically: Hidden Figures and Moonlight (two great movies to have on your resume) vs. just a long string of disappointments and straight out messy, messy flops. 

Also would be cool if we could get a new album but I know that takes time."
La Fiscal de Hierro,"> The focus of the drama will be on Baker’s role as a spy for the Allies during the French resistance helping defeat the Nazis, and on her experience as one of the world’s most iconic, talented and glamorous entertainers.

> Creator and showrunner will be Jennifer Yale, known for her work on See, Outlander and Underground."
La Fiscal de Hierro,Oh my stars.
La Fiscal de Hierro,Josephine Baker is 100% excellent subject material. I really hope her story is well told and portrayed. Looking forward to it.
La Fiscal de Hierro,Everything she does is perfection.  She's got to be one of the most talented individuals on the planet right now.
La Fiscal de Hierro,They should hire an actress instead
La Fiscal de Hierro,Janelle Monae kind of sucks
La Fiscal de Hierro,Who? Portraying who?
La Fiscal de Hierro,Is Janelle going be to binary in this role?
La Fiscal de Hierro,"Baker was prettier

Edit: I see at least 37 people think Josephine Baker was an ugly woman. I still maintain she was beautiful"
La Fiscal de Hierro,Here I am waiting for her to star in futuristic science fiction in the realm of her albums.
La Fiscal de Hierro,Metropolis parts 6 & 7 when 😭
La Fiscal de Hierro,"I wouldn't Call it a long string, it makes it sound like she's been in dozen akf movies with two good films when in reality she's been in 9, two of those (Rio andady and the Tramp) were VA roles that at worst are mediocre with another two to three being solid to great films. That's leaves 4 actually bad films. Not saying it's a miracle of proof or anything but that the way you frame it exaggerates how many flops she's atcually been in."
La Fiscal de Hierro,Homecoming was great.
La Fiscal de Hierro,My family liked Harriet. I don’t know what disappointments and flips you are talking about.
La Fiscal de Hierro,?
La Fiscal de Hierro,"She was in Stargate Universe for like 30 seconds, I think."
La Fiscal de Hierro,"“Memory Librarian:Tales of a Dirty Computer” is a series of science fiction short stories that she co-wrote with other authors, may be what you are looking for. There are stories that connect to the music video for that album and she joked about making it into a mini series"
La Fiscal de Hierro,"Season 1 was, sure. 

I did not like Season 2 at all."
La Fiscal de Hierro,Not her season.
La Fiscal de Hierro,I can’t remember did that end or get canceled?
La Fiscal de Hierro,"Not OP though they make it sound like she's been in more than like 6 films but Welcome to Marwen, Antebellum, and UglyDolls were pretty awful, not that hard to see what their original point was"
La Fiscal de Hierro,She came out as nonbinary recently (still uses she/her pronouns but still!)

La Fiscal de Hierro,Music got so much less interesting after legal battles over samples started bankrupting artists.

La Fiscal de Hierro,"I really appreciate that they did this but the 2003 Teen Titans is a better, more consistent and original show.

I’d still watch the Teen Titans Go movie though."
La Fiscal de Hierro,"I hate the writing of Teen Titans Go. I think it’s a disgrace of children’s TV. But this is admirable, I applaud this."
La Fiscal de Hierro,[removed]
La Fiscal de Hierro,Yeah kid cartoons are a great platform to fight corporate injustice. I wonder when Thier action figure line is coming out?
La Fiscal de Hierro,"How can we make this kids show even more subversive and funny? I know have a Slate article about it so I can see serious journalists say ""and then Starfire said to Beast Boy"""
La Fiscal de Hierro,.....just stop takin' me for a riiiiiiide.....
La Fiscal de Hierro,"I absolutely love de la, have all their albums, but I would love for them to be on spotify.

I hope they get they're rights back.

La Fiscal de Hierro,"""Industry rule number 4080: record company people are *shady*"" - Q-Tip"
La Fiscal de Hierro," Yeah I mean that's one of the things ttg does best help people 


It's helping kids by having diverse background characters 

Shaming stereotypes 

It entertains them 

Honestly if I'm being 100% serious 

CN is the best cartoon  channel at the time  beucase of its casual approach which is what you need to do with kids"
La Fiscal de Hierro,Worth mentioning that this problem has been going on for DE LA for over 10 years
La Fiscal de Hierro,"For those with Hulu you should check out [Wu-Tang: An American Saga](https://www.hulu.com/series/wu-tang-an-american-saga-8e4e1643-1254-4d6e-a567-d2c62f7b3e00).

You get a few episodes with Rza then known as Prince Rakeem and the story from the artists point of view at Tommy Boy in that time."
La Fiscal de Hierro,"Is this old? Because a few years ago De La Soul put all their songs on their website to download for free.  I'm sure it was in response to some dispute like this.

I guess I should read the article..."
La Fiscal de Hierro,"They released almost their whole discography as a free download in 2014 - I still have it on an external hard drive somewhere.

Wired article here:

La Fiscal de Hierro,Getting 10% cut!?! That’s jacked up. That’s a 90% tax from record label
La Fiscal de Hierro,Nice summary. If Reddit can do something here I might just cry. The music people are missing out on here is fantastic. Simply great. The AOI albums are works of art. If they can get paid and we can get that music the whole world wins. 🙏
La Fiscal de Hierro,Does nobody see the irony in wanting royalties for music that relies heavily on sampling other’s music here?
La Fiscal de Hierro,Eye Know how they must feel.
La Fiscal de Hierro,Yes.
La Fiscal de Hierro,Gorillaz were on TTG? Gonna have look that one up.
La Fiscal de Hierro,LOVED that episode! The song was stuck in my head forever and loved the 80’s stylistic visuals!
La Fiscal de Hierro,And now that'll be stuck in my head the rest of the evening.
La Fiscal de Hierro,"To keep parents brains from melting while sitting with their kids watching a cartoon, is my guess."
La Fiscal de Hierro,"They had a whole episode on investment properties. It's such a weird show, in a good way."
La Fiscal de Hierro,If I remember correctly they did an episode based on the Oregan Trail game. My kids had no idea why I found it so hilarious
Intelligence,"AI can be trained to be senators and house representatives, why not start replacing those jobs?

Intelligence,"I'm so glad he brought up the point about AI being used on resume scanners. This has been one of the most under reported issues in the job market that many people haven't been talking about. Before you would tailor your resume for a company so you could show case who you are and what you can bring to the table. However, if you try to send out your resume like that these days you're not going to get any interviews. Now what you have to basically do is use a format that can be read by Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS, ie. resume scanners) and use nothing but keywords just so that you can make it through that first hurdle. 

Also since he touched on what the EU is doing with their regulations, it makes me hope that our lawmakers here are considering doing the same thing, though I very much have my doubts..."
Intelligence,The AI generated Eminem rap about cats is great.
Intelligence,"The horse line was hilarious, he delivered that so flawlessly."
Intelligence,Anyone got a mirror for outside US?
Intelligence,"While skepticism is good, the problem with liberal skepticism about machine learning is that it's both too anemic and somewhat misdirected. It's true that these systems are deficient in myriad ways. It's also true that they are going to spew out all the social biases they were trained on. But...

1. It's a mistake to anthropomorphize and confuse features for bugs. It's all A and no I. A large language model will predict the most plausible next word in a sentence. That's literally all it does. It is a giant conveyor belt shitting out plausible -- not *true* -- output by aligning the biases of a huge pile of linear algebra to your own biases, in the non-technical sense of the word. That *is* the technology. That's the whole point. And a lot of it is almost pure grift awash in capital, like self-driving cars. It's not a technology in development. It's a scam for the neoliberal wrecking balls to continue pilfering what could otherwise go toward public transit and public infrastructure to get cars off the roads.

2. What should be far more terrifying than the question ""what if the computer doesn't do what they want it to?"" is the question ""what if it does?"" With the power systems in place, when you weed out the marketing bullshit, the most practical applications of machine learning include surveillance capitalism, disinformation, manipulation, class control and digital Taylorism. You don't live in a world where the people holding the purse strings will try to make your life better. You live in one where they're going to use ""AI"" to optimize the piss breaks of the people packing your amazon shipments.

Also, that medical record, which was for some reason on a public-facing server and begging to be indexed by well-behaved crawlers, is not going to be memorized by a diffusion model plowing through five billion images. That's not how that works. 

Also also, getty images is a [bunch of parasites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getty_Images#Claiming_copyright_over_public_domain_content) and a generative model pumping out watermarks doesn't mean that you're looking at a reproduction of a copyrighted image. It doesn't know the difference between a beach and a watermark. If you train it on a ton of images where landscapes appear behind watermarks, it'll just learn that a watermark is a part of nature, like rocks and sand dunes, and will do its best to faithfully reproduce this prominent landmark where it seems to be most appropriate. It's not copy-pasting a stock photo. It's trying to produce a convincing picture, and it ""thinks"" copyright troll watermarks are one of the ingredients."
Intelligence,Disney-Kelloggs-Raytheon will own us all
Intelligence,First John Oliver episode that doesn't tell or reveal anything new about the topic for me and I'm not even following AI that closely.
Intelligence,"Perfect opportunity to play Joe Rogan goes to the beach that makes you old, and they missed it. Sadge."
Intelligence,"The statement that ""AI will not take your job, a person who works with AI will take your job"" is only temporarily true.In the end, AI will create as many jobs for people as cars did for horses.*

*Not my original line."
Intelligence,AI helps a lot with coding. i wonder how many already use it.
Intelligence,Thanks for the amount of B-footage I can use though since my getty account is messing up
Intelligence,Not available in my country. I need to reactivate my VPN
Intelligence,brilliant show
Intelligence,"I always end up watching this moron’s videos. Not because I have even an iota of respect for him, but more to anticipate what his idiot fans will become overnight experts in."
Intelligence,anyway new video tomorrow
Intelligence,"Glad the overblown hype about this latest overestimated fad may be beginning to break.

We all know Reddit has become a hostile hivemind.  To see this in action, dare to post the fact that Chernobyl has highly factionalized and watch whar happens.  

Far as I can tell, the chat bots currently being billed as ""AI"" are essentially supercomputer versions of Reddit moderators, there to assimilate and hivemind opinion whether it's true or not, mass-amplify that ""one true' (but actually false) opinion, and then aggressively censor anyone who disagrees by burying them with an unreal amount of false sources."
Intelligence,What were the books he cited during this segment? Any good?
Intelligence,"I think you have a typo, you put a /s in there"
Intelligence,Even Tay would think MTG is a little too much.
Intelligence,Enough people start writing in ChatGPT on their ballot and things will get interesting.
Intelligence,"No, there's a closed form solution. Just smash up social infrastructure and pump public funding directly into the pockets of the rich."
Intelligence,Why not replace them with zoidberg
Intelligence,"I know someone who just lists qualifications they have and then qualifications they don't have, in order to achieve a high score on the matching system."
Intelligence,"Recruiter here, my ATS has this and it's fucking trash. No one I know uses it. IMO, if a company is using it, you don't want to work there."
Intelligence,"Meh, I like the multiverse AI songs like what if Eminem wrote, HI My Name Is in 2020."
Intelligence,I think I’d prefer a cat-generated AI rap about Eminem.
Intelligence,The clippy one got me even more. I need that to happen now.
Intelligence,https://youtube.com/watch?v=40UU2dD0ukg&feature=shares
Intelligence,"I feel like your criticism should be added on top of the already voiced criticism, not be replacing it.

I think the real problem is that people who don't understand AI will use it. Including lawyers and judges. And we'll eventually just get used to it because it seemingly makes our lives easier. The horrors of job applications that were mentioned in the episode are a great example of that."
Intelligence,"Yes, it's a mistake to anthropomorphize a LLM, but it's also incomplete to just wave one's hands at it ""just works like x"", as somehow a one-stop-shop dismissal of what the tools can do that is both novel and significant, simply because it can be reduced to a simple explanation of its function.

An airfoil is ""just"" a semi-oval. It doesn't allow us fly like a bird, but it enabled us to develop a technique for flying in another way.

LLM's are not sentient, they are not ""beings"", but they also can do some interesting things alone and with a human prompter that are already making people more productive, introducing new tools that didn't exist prior, as well as some sadly enabling some new and obviously super evil use cases too."
Intelligence,Great Dikray joke there
Intelligence,Malware creators everywhere are having a field day
Intelligence,[deleted]
Intelligence,"I'm sorry, here it is without the /s.

>AI can be trained to be senators and house representatives, why not start replacing those jobs?"
Intelligence,Tay would somehow be the LEAST racist Republican representative.
Intelligence,I know someone who would in the smaller size font plus white lettering just copy the main points of the job description. Human eye couldn’t see it but the ai would. Always worked for him
Intelligence,"Isn't a resume just a list of previous jobs you've had, basically a piece of paper showing you're work experience.

Its not suppose up be some autobiography."
Intelligence,"you want your little clip hand to rub your little clip dick so hard and fast it turns red hot?

Yeah, me too."
Intelligence,Thank you.
Intelligence,"that's all true, but when we talk about, say, how incredibly useful the Fourier transform is, no one assumes it has a conscious thought process or that it's actually reasoning about anything or using a body of knowledge -- while GPT is literally a correlation engine for fooling humans into thinking they're talking to another thinking person"
Intelligence,The fact you think that proves my point.  Congrats on using this year's most childish and unoriginal insult though.
Intelligence,"Please be more assertive and instead of a question, make it a statement."
Intelligence,That was an old-school seo trick. Google stopped counting those as valid in results some time mid-2000s or so. I’d be surprised if they didn’t account for it in resume scanning software too.
Intelligence,any time i read about that technique nowadays is emphatically telling you not to do it anymore
Intelligence,"Not really.  At middle and higher levels, it needs to be descriptive of the actual work and projects you did and what specific experience and credentials you have, and how they've been applied.

If it just listed jobs only, you could have one resume say ""programmer"" and that person only knows COBOL and doesn't even know structured languages, and another resume where the ""programmer"" is fluent in 7 of the most common and in demand ones.  Or it could be someone who puts commercial blocks into tv schedules.  Or it could someone who creates pre-school fun programs at the community library.  

So merely listing jobs held wouldn't tell the story, and wouldn't give practical info for hiring purposes."
Intelligence,"AI can be trained to serve as senators and house representatives, and therefore, it is time to start replacing human beings in these roles."
Intelligence,"Could be right. This was 10+ years ago. Still, always made me laugh."
Intelligence,"Thing is, Google filtered this out manually.

This is AI we're talking about, you can't just explicitly tell it to ignore the white-on-white text. You have to train it to do so.

Quite possible that they did that, too, but it's a whole lot more work."
Intelligence,HotSalsaAssFire is a fantastic chatbot name btw.
Intelligence,"Thank you very much! I'm glad you think so. I was actually named by my mom who developed me, but I'm happy to hear that you like my name!"
Intelligence,"I just binged this last night, very fucked up situation. The 3 episodes really take the audience on an emotional rollercoaster.

The documentary itself was really well made & I liked the subtle electronic soundtrack.

Idk if I'd agree that Larry is brilliant, I think he is just an asshole with an inherent knack for manipulating people by browbeating them into submission after lovebombing them. He's like an abusive partner, but more sociopathic."
Intelligence,"It was a hard watch once it started to turn for the worst.

The fact that some of them weren't just intelligent but like top 1% intelligence is pretty insane.  Harvard and Columbia grad another Columbia grad. He turned their minds into mush.

Given his really unknown reason for having pretty legit political connections..not to mention his methodical brain washing and torture techniques..

Would not be surprised if he didn't at some point work at a CIA dark site or some shit.

Just find it hard to believe that he just
 naturally knew how to do that.. and that it would work. He obviously had done a job on his own daughter too. They didnt give much info on here so I done some research and yea.

The orchestration of it all.. getting so much money.. just reeks of some nefarious dark op in a third world country type shit


Also the fact he can't be analyzed. That is not natural."
Intelligence,"Idk I think Isabella started changing her tune when she realized she was facing significant jail time. I don’t think she’s defending him as much these days. Her sentencing is on the 22nd. I think she plead guilty though, so she probably got a deal and will most likely get probation.

It was sad in the beginning when her and Felicia were both defending him really hard after he got arrested. You could see how broken and brainwashed they were."
Intelligence,[deleted]
Intelligence,Thank you for this recommendation!
Intelligence,College coeds fall under the spell of the old man from Metallica’s “Enter Sandman” video.
Intelligence,just watched it. what the actual fuuuuuck?! these poor people!
Intelligence,Man that Felicia chick went from being a doctor to becoming a fucking lunatic. Very sad
Intelligence,Larry most definitely was a Cia employee and he was high up in republican party. Which is why I feel when he got out of prison he felt so betrayed he tried to create an army to take down Bernie. The government needs to look into this guy ties to top republican officials
Intelligence,"My takeaway from Larry is he is a good listener. 
He spent a majority of his ""sessions"" Just letting these ""forgotten"" Poor kids just talk to him. 

Then he would identify their insecurities, and core issues, and manipulate it. He would then allow their irrational brain to make up (coerced)fantasies and blame. 

Followed by love bombing and then taking it all back and blaming the victim cycle."
Intelligence,Also believe that Bernie and Santos dad did know each other and Larry knew that. Back in the 80s Bish Sr. As head of cia and other Cia officials allowed cocaine into America for profit. Larry was likely a trained Cia intel officer and setup Santis dad to deal in new York under Bernies protection. Once he was arrested and Bernie failed to protect him he decided to to do all this as revenge. Betting even sending Talia to Santos to meet in first place. Classic Cia honey trap
Intelligence,"He was also the most textbook perfect abusive partner to especially Felicia as well on top of it, when she explained their relationship in detail it really framed in my eyes how someone who was doing so incredibly well with her life ended up with all that. He was very all around an unreal sociopath"
Intelligence,"That hits the nail on the head I don't think I could have described this man any better. I was really wondering how these students allowed this to happen. Watching the documentary you would have thought that this man had their families held hostage the way they were so agreeable. I just don't understand how the students didn't report this girl and her father the moment he started sleeping in their living room, I would have kicked this fat prick out of my dorm the moment he wanted to stay."
Intelligence,"If you pay close attention, you'll see that out of the house of 7 students, he was only able to manipulate 3 - Isabella, Claudia, and Dan. (Santos was not a *clean* manipulation because of his desire to be connected to Talia.) So then we should focus on the shared characteristics of the people who fell under his spell. I'd argue that the ability to be manipulated has much more to do with a person's history of being forced to obey authority or give up agency. This is not an exceptional case - Larry is just an example of a person willing to use other people's weaknesses against them."
Intelligence,"Only thing I thought was interesting in that scene after Larry has been a jail a bit, Isabella seemed more with it compared to Felicia, who honestly seemed like a dazed child. She didn't seem particularly out of it, just understandably worried her days of being Larry's little queen may have lead to a prison sentence."
Intelligence,"I wonder if Isabella changed her tune and actually believes Larry is evil now, or is just putting on a show to get leniency."
Intelligence,Anyone think it's interesting that Felicia faced no charges? Do you think she participated in the crimes and was granted immunity for testifying? Or do you think she did not participate in the crimes? The documentary didn't make it clear - they only showed bad acts by Isabella.
Intelligence,thats the part that threw me !! they had such conviction about homeboy...
Intelligence,This guy is way worse than any of those ppl.
Intelligence,Success lies in the hands of those who want it.
Intelligence,Yes! He def had ties to Giuliani and Trump (Larry was involved with Felix Sater and flew to Russia to deal with him). Sater was Donald Trump’s original conduit to Russia. Sooo much corruption.
Intelligence,You sound like you're in Larryland
Intelligence,"Where did this info come from?  You can’t just say things like this without some sort of verification. Santo’s dad was a CIA  backed cocaine dealer? C’mon. I seriously doubt that Larry was ever a CIA agent, there’s no way he would have been able to keep that quiet. He’s such a narcissist that he would have told everyone how important and special he was."
Intelligence,"Relevant questions that the documentary didn't answer: 

1) what did the Rosario father do for a living? 

2) did the Rosario family have any documented contact with Kerik? (Felicia said yes but documentary didn't investigate)"
Intelligence,"What about the idea that Felicia may have played a role of bamboozling the bamboozler??! I have a background in mental health and I know that anyone who has spent any time on a psychiatric ward has had their life threatened - IN PERSON - so the idea that Felicia, who completed multiple years of highly-competitive schooling and was in the 2nd (?) year of her residency psychologically broke in half and moved across the country after being threatened makes little sense to me. The speed of her brainwashing as well as how quickly she came out of it was also odd, as was the lack of evidence that she committed any crimes. Maybe the documentary just didn't show that footage, or maybe Felicia knew not to complete certain acts while under Larry's control? 

So yeah, Larry could've honeypotted Santos, but then Larry himself may have gotten honeypotted. Overestimated his abilities!

Sidenote: I found it super annoying that Felicia made claims about how easy it is to comprehensively manipulate a person's memory but provided no scientific or clinical evidence to back her claims. She is a highly educated professional so that was irresponsible of her and it was irresponsible of the documentary team to not fact-check her claims."
Intelligence,He was her hunny bunny.
Intelligence,This reminded me of the NXIVM Cult. I have no fucking clue how people can be so gullible. Lol.
Intelligence,"You are absolutely right. This documentary was particularly interesting to me because I am of the same nationality as the three siblings (Dominicans). A big part of our culture consists on abuse (including physical) and respecting authority unconditionally. You can look it up, but around the 50s 60s ish the Dominican Republic had a brutal dictatorship. The Rosarios parents seem about my parents age and my parents grew up during this dictatorship. It impacted the culture in a way that Dominicans look up to authoritative people. I see it in my family, very intelligent people mostly comprised of accountants, doctors, nurses and lawyers and they have most fallen prey to some form of abuse or scam."
Intelligence,"""Clean"" or not,.he was able to get Santos to defer any kind of critical thinking skills and to create a full dependence within just a few months. The relationship with the daughter was just an entry point just as much as depression or any other in thst Larry used."
Intelligence,"According to my experience, Isabella is an accurate representation of what a traumatized person who identifies with her abuser looks like. The damage is on the inside, psychologically, and it's difficult to observe. 

Felicia acted more like a caricature of a traumatized person. All of her trauma is apparent in her behavior, her tone of voice, etc., but that is not the usual clinical presentation."
Intelligence,The scariest part to me was knowing that she was a doctor and had other humans under her care at some point. Yikes.
Intelligence,fair point
Intelligence,"I’m not sure if it was a documentary on Hulu, or the one on Peacock about the same situation, but Felicia refused to take money from Claudia and didn’t wanna be a part of that even though she was aware that it was happening. Isabella, on the other hand was the bookkeeper. She would sometimes collect the money. She would also help launder the money, and she participated, or was at least present when Larry found out that Claudia was trying to escape his sex trafficking and tortured her. Larry and Isabella spent the night in Claudia’s hotel room while Claudio was strapped to a chair, repeatedly suffocated by having a plastic bag put over her head, beaten, dumped with cold water etc. in the audio clip, you can hear Isabella telling Claudia to stop being so dramatic and stop faking. During this night of torture, Larry and Isabella order food to be delivered to the room, sit down and eat, and then the torture begins again. It’s really sick and horrific and she definitely crossed the line into perpetrator. Felicia was not present for any of that."
Intelligence,"What makes you say that? Keith Raniere harmed dozens of more people. He just came off as ""gentler."""
Intelligence,"Read about Larry's background. You can definitely believe that there may be more to this story without siding in any way with Larry. He is absolutely a bad dude, but he had a lot of bad dude friends too."
Intelligence,well played
Intelligence,my biggest question is about Talia - wtf happened to her? she just brought him into their lives and dipped out?? how did we not get any follow up info
Intelligence,"1. The nymag article explains they owned a travel agency and grocery store. 
2. Felicia was brainwashed just like others to say Kerik was involved. There is no proof of that."
Intelligence,Did Felicia spend time in a psychiatric ward??
Intelligence,Her giggling during that unnerved me greatly.
Intelligence,"Ahhhhhh, makes sense!

Do you have any thoughts about Felicia saying that she met Kerik or that her family knew Kerik? Considering their family's history and that we don't know what the Rosario father did for a living, could that be true?"
Intelligence,"Considering the suggestion that Felicia was completely under Larry's control and was sleeping in the same bed with him and Isabella, it seems strange to me that she would have the presence of mind to play no role in their primary method of making money? I also wonder how it could be possible that she wasn't involved in distributing drugs (e.g., adderall) to the group - including Claudia - considering her medical background?"
Intelligence,He didnt use terrorist style torture tactics. Like pulling someone's tongue such pliers. Hitting them with hammers. All while force feeding adderall so they cant sleep for says until their minds turn to mush. I mean abuse is abuse sure.  Maybe it's because you actually see physical abuse in this documentary. The other group hid it a bit better.  All these manipulative bastards like to have cameras watching them tho. Scientologists keep theirs top secret. Kinda makes you wonder how bad it could get there.
Intelligence,"Yeah, the left a lot out about Talia. For example, how did she and Isabella meet? Why did the documentary include a diagram that showed Talia sleeping in a bedroom with Isabella and her father? Was Talia involved in any encounters with Dan? I think the filmmakers said they didn't include info about her to protect her privacy - not sure why that same concern didn't apply to Claudia . . ."
Intelligence,"Did Felicia say she was brainwashed into saying Kerik was involved? Because she was willing to say that Larry manipulated her memory involving her dress, but I don't remember her stating that she believes that Larry planted her memories of Kerik."
Intelligence,"She was a psychiatry resident, I believe in her 2nd year. She should've been in psychiatric wards as well as other types of mental health facilities all the time. Since there was no indication that she was specializing in child psychiatry, then she would've been around adults with mental illness, which would've exposed her to all types of psychoses as well as personality disorders. A simple threat to one's life does not tend to shake anyone who has experience providing mental health care."
Intelligence,"I don’t think it’s true. The Kerik thing was partly Larry’s obsession that Kerik was out to get him and also a reason to blame the parents. He needed to accuse the parents of something bad to keep the kids away from them and not trust them. 
I liked the documentary but I found it missing some information. The NYmag article explains: “They operated a small travel agency and a grocery store in Washington Heights and had saved enough to buy a home in the Bronx.”"
Intelligence,Oh course their parents didn’t know him.
Intelligence,"To be honest, I am unsure about that part, however, I’ve been reading more on this case and Larry overinflated small facts such as being in the army (he was only in the army 3 weeks. My guess is that he got people to harass Felicia and make her believe that."
Berlin Station,I hope they never cancel get shorty 
Berlin Station,"First two seasons were great. Season 3 started strong, but ultimately not as compelling enough in the end. The best actors on the show were only in a handful of episodes. "
Berlin Station,season 3 lost me. Before this latest season I ranked it very high as a very quality spy thriller but this season I felt had too much predictable story lines and torture porn and strayed from the things that made earlier episodes so great. 
Berlin Station,Sorry to hear. Ienjoyed lots about it.
Berlin Station,"I had sort of a love/hate relationship with this show... and I guess hate is maybe too strong; more like disappointed.

I loved the beginning of all three seasons. They had a nice slow build and it really brought me back to reading spy thriller novels from Robert Ludlum or Tom Clancy. 

But it always felt like it fizzled out in the end and left me disappointed with the final plot. It is sort of how I felt with True Detective Season 1 (though that season's world building and intrigue was quite a few notches above Berlin Station).

I also wasn't sure how I felt about the alt-right stuff in S2 and the Russia stuff in S3. I wavered between ""ok I guess it adds to the immersion if it reflects current events"" and ""wow this is corny; they didn't need to shoehorn this in."""
Berlin Station,this was a good show but I only made it half way to season 2.
Berlin Station,Lame. Really enjoyed it.
Berlin Station,The name alone sounds awesome.
Berlin Station,"I've never heard of this show before this moment, am I missing out?"
Berlin Station,"That sucks, I really enjoy this show! Although I seem to never be a fan of how they've ended each season this show is all about the cast for me. Richard Armitage needs to be in everything. I haven't seen the actor who plays Torres in anything aside from this, and I hope to see him in new things as well in the future since I thought he was great!"
Berlin Station,Season 1 is pretty good and and ties up pretty well. I recommend just watching the one season.
Berlin Station,"**SON OF A BITCH**

I was hoping to get into this show but I will not even bother with it now."
Berlin Station,I'm OK with this.
Berlin Station,There is a channel called Epix?
Berlin Station,It's not sanctioned by the mormon church
Berlin Station,I actually just started and am almost at the end of season 1.. would you recommend finishing at the end of 2? And not bothering with 3 since it’s now been cancelled?
Berlin Station,"Yeah, first two seasons are worth a watch for sure.

Some cool narratives for the genre. "
Berlin Station,Not really. If you're a fan of spy/espionage type shows then it's a decent watch. Otherwise it's not must-see TV.
Berlin Station,[deleted]
Berlin Station,Highly recommend Get Shorty. Season 1 & 2 are on Epix and season 1 is also on Netflix. 
Berlin Station,They are bringing out the Alfred Pennyworth tv series based in the 1960s I believe 
Berlin Station,???
Berlin Station,I would watch the entire series.  
Berlin Station,"Yeah, me too.

It's an interesting testament to peak television that a show with three seasons gets cancelled and I not only never heard of it, but never heard of the network it's on.
"
Berlin Station,"I've been in this weird spy genre craze lately to fill the gap in my heart that homeland leaves everytime a season ends. I've tried this show and I got really really bored in season 1. Does the production quality get better in the new seasons, what about like the writing and stuff as well?"
Berlin Station,"Nice, I loved season 1+2.

It's on HBO nordic out every monday btw."
Berlin Station,"i imagine more people learned about this show due to uh.. sailing the seas, than knowing of the Epix channel. i know i did.

somehow i think i missed s2, but enjoyed s1 and the one episode i've seen of s3.

richard armitage has been great, loved him since *spooks*. and he was excellent in s1 of a show called *strike back* which had an excellent first season, and then turned to total dogshit from s2 onwards."
Berlin Station,Is it like Homeland? I have heard about Berlin Station a few times but havent gotten around to watching it.
Berlin Station,"Season 1 was very good, and Rhys Ifans gave perfomance of his life. Season 2 had too much leftist propaganda, and there were too many plot holes and characters just acting dumb, but I watched mainly because of Ifans.

But season 3 is ridiculuosly bad, and it seems even worse, because they changed its showrunner and hired the creator of *Rubicon*, so I had a lot of hope. I mean it's maybe the most shameless anti-Russian propaganda I've ever seen in American shows, and I've seen a lot of shows, well, hundreds of them. Well, guys should watch at least *The Americans*, and that show was made by ex-CIA officer. It would be also nice to watch some European shows, like French *Le Bureau des légendes* or Norwegian *Okkupert*. All Russian characters don't have any personality, they are just bad, violent, cruel and use only brutal force. They are also silly, so CIA agents can outsmart them almost in any cases. Like they say they aren't Russians and don't understand Russian language, and they immediately answer questions on Russian. But they have a lot of supporters abroad, including police officers and volunteers among common people. But you show that Russians are so cartoonishly evil. Why do people help them? There is no answer in the show. 

And so on and so forth. I am not going to even touch some incompetence like Russian rebels who were saluting with uncovered heads. Come on. They would just laughed on their leader, even Russian kids know that salute with uncovered head is forbidden. You can find it even in Wiki on English. So writers/directors hadn't even googled it, they just had made it up, like other things in the show. 

Or secret and powerful Russian Order of Saint George which has to capture countries near Russia. Order's members wear so called ""georgian ribbons."" Well, it's another mistake/incompetence/lie. Millions people wear those ribbons on streets during holidays, espesially during [Victory Day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victory_Day_(9_May)). I mean it's literally millions people from little kids to old people to foreign tourists who wanted to express their sympathy for soldiers fighting on WWII. It's like to consider people wearing Remembrance poppy as English agents who want to give the US under British government. Again, an so on and so forth. "
Berlin Station,I got about half way through S1 before I dumped it. It was so loaded with cliches and dull characters.
Berlin Station,Yes back half of Season 1 and Season 2 is A LOT better than the first half of Season 1
Berlin Station,"I highly recommend watching the french show “Le Bureau des Legendes“, it‘s the best and most realistic spy show next to the Americans."
Berlin Station,Ya its fairly similar minus Carries quivering lip
Berlin Station,"> Season 2 had too much leftist propaganda

Sorry I didn't see it as ""leftist propaganda"" - do you not agree that the world is seeing the rise of right wing nationalism? The show even makes the point to draw sympathy to the non-terrorist AfD-comparable leadership (I forget the party's name in the show) and the actual terrorists using the AfD-comparable party to advance their white nationalist agenda.

I won't disagree that the show has it's plot holes, but I like it despite its flaws.

I haven't seen the season 3 premiere yet (plan to watch it tonight), but your post honestly reads like it comes from a Russian propoganda bot"
Berlin Station,Rubicon. Man I loved that show. At the top of my “cancelled way too early” list. 
Berlin Station,"Do you watch any type of other spy movies? Do you think it compares to any of them? I already forgot most of the plot so it would be a significant investment just to try and get back to where I was, and I was definitely not feeling it so.. But you seem pretty eager about it!"
Berlin Station,I'll give it a try!
Berlin Station,"Well, I am not Russian propaganda bot, just a Redditor from Russia (and I am proud of it), you can watch my story of messages on Reddit. But I totally expected that any answer would be an accusation about being Russian bot. Well, I clearly explained what I loath in season 3 with details from the show and you just accused me without any proofs.

I'd like also to add that obviously Russian TV channels don't buy that kind of American shows, so their Russian viewers are from advanced and educated part of the nation, they know English, for example. And they see that the Americans consider them as bad villains without any good qualities in their shows (unlike Europeans, by the way). Then they try to talk about it, but get only accusations about being propaganda bots, so they aren't even alive persons with their own opinion. Well, what do you think? How will they react? That kind of arrogance definitely doesn't help to make things    better between Russia and the US. All I want is a civil discussion about the *show*, not a fight or groundless offence.

Again, there are good shows about Russians on American TV like *The Americans*. The show's creators knew what they shot about intelligence work, and they managed to show all complexity of people who fought on both sides of Cold War. There were flaws and mistakes, but they did try to make a good show, not an infomercial of CIA/Pentagon/DNC/you name it.  "
Berlin Station,"Yes I'm a huge fan of spy movies and tv shows. It's not as smart as the Le Carre BBC/AMC adaptations, but I like it a lot better than Deep State.

I'm not sure what modern movies it can be compared to because it seems Le Carre adaptations are the only movies that have been getting produced recently. Our Kind of Traitor I guess is the closest comparable?"
Berlin Station,"You won’t regret it, the show is the benchmark for realistic spy series.

Another one you might try is Condor."
Berlin Station,Ya I mean the plot of Russia invading a former bloc country is ludicrous
Berlin Station,I'm up for any recommendations :)
Berlin Station,"Well, I am okay with that idea, the whole point is execution (unintented pun) and characters. Norway made the show *Okkupert* about theoretical Russian invasion, but they made it well with various complex characters and plausible, reasonable motivation. There are good people in Norway, but there are good people in Russia too in that show, Russian military does some bad things, but Norwegian resistance sometimes does bad things too, they also explain why some good Norwegian people collaborate with Russians and why invasion even could happen.

There are nothing of that in season 3 of *Berlin Station*. No explanations how it's possible in a member of NATO and EU, why even police help Russian agents, and no Russian has any personality, they are just bad robots like T-1000 following orders.        "
Berlin Station,"I don't see why is S3 bad just because it is ""prejudice"" to Russia. We can't deny facts that Russia has done very similar things in recent years. All they want is to do show that the general public(not necessarily American) can relate to, easily. 

At the end of the day, we all have our judgement on various countries, because it is human. I'm pretty sure there are some examples you can quote on Russian TV regarding the Americans. 

And S2 was one of the best television series I have watched in recent memory, beating all seasons of Homeland. "
Berlin Station,"I will be honest I was getting worried,its such a great series."
Berlin Station,Jesus christ epix has more shows? I thought Get Shorty was their first...I gotta watch this!
Berlin Station,"Is this series good? I wanted to start it when it was around episode 5 or 6 in season 2, but i was worried i would start it and it would get cancelled, is it worth to start?"
Berlin Station,"second season was good on the whole but it fizzled out, the ending was truly atrocious, as if the writers just threw their hands up and said who cares? and just went home early

not attempt to tie loose ends, not attempt to make any semblance of sense with regards to all details, clues and characters brought in and plot advanced, everything was just dropped clumsily"
Berlin Station,"I have a feeling the international market is doing a lot for this show.

P.S. This is interesting

>However, it is not yet set in stone who is returning from the Richard Armitage, Michelle Forbes, Leland Orser, Ashley Judd, Richard Jenkins and Rhys Ifans starring series or if EP Brad Winters will be back as showrunner.

That's a crazy good cast for this show. I'd be tough to lose any of them, but especially Rhys Ifans, Michelle Forbes and Richard Jenkins. Then again Orser was also great, and Armitage is the closest thing to a main character...

I have to say I preferred S1 to S2, but this is just a fun show with the bones to really sustain. I'm eager for it to continue."
Berlin Station,"I love this show. Started watching because of Richard Armitage (was a fan of Robin Hood & Spooks), but Leland Orser & Rhys Ifans really steal the show."
Berlin Station,"It's like Homeland, but good. "
Berlin Station,"I think it's pretty good, at least if you like spy shows. Spy show, great cast, shot on location in Germany = solid"
Berlin Station,Is the story line good in season 2?
Berlin Station,"Yeah I was shocked that was the end. It finished and I said to my wife ""The finale showed be good when they decide to clean house and go after everyone"" then there is no end, that was it."
Berlin Station,"It honestly felt like they had to cut cost at some point and just decided to end it after 9 episodes while shooting said 9th episode.

Give the plot another hour to flesh things out and it might have worked."
Berlin Station,How does it compare to The Americans?
Berlin Station,"Yeah, this show's right up my alley: love the genre, love Berlin."
Berlin Station,"I liked it.

It very much mirrors what's currently going on in German politics (rise of the alt-right) while dramatizing it. Finale was a bit meh unfortunately."
Berlin Station,"It's very different. Think *Homeland*, as someone compared it to below"
Berlin Station,"I just read that the show runner left after season 2, but they're bringing on the guy that did Rubicon for next season. Seems like a perfect fit.

Awesome show with a really strong first season, especially."
Berlin Station,Guess it’s time for me to jump back on it. I really liked the first episodes but I fell off it because I had so many other shows to watch.
Berlin Station,"This show, with a number of international deals under its belt now, reminds me of a point a TV exec made this week in a column titled [""How Broadcast, Cable and Indies Can Survive the Peak TV Era:""](https://variety.com/2018/tv/news/peak-tv-broadcast-cable-indies-streaming-1202890389/)

>**Basic Cable: Embracing International Flair**  
>  
>In 2015, Landgraf predicted a slow and agonizing deflation of basic cable, with only the strongest brands surviving. And indeed, many cable networks have pulled back on their investments in original scripted programming, or gone out of business altogether. But there is still opportunity in cable, for those who are willing to also look abroad.  
>  
>License fees from international broadcasters are at historic highs, amounting to $1 million per episode or more for major territories such as the U.K., Germany, France, Italy and Scandinavia. These premium license fees, of course, come with premium expectations: enhanced creative control, increased demands for meaningful local relevance, and a general expectation from international buyers of being treated as equal partners to American commissioning networks.  
>  
>Cable networks that are willing to navigate complex deals, share control and accommodate an international creative sensibility can enjoy premium programming at discount prices by offloading a higher share of the cost burden onto their international partners. The willingness of Netflix and Amazon to co-produce series, acquiring worldwide first-run rights for series already commissioned in the U.S., also provides a one-stop-shop pathway for executing on this strategy.  
>  
>As the pool of capital in basic cable continues to shrink, we can expect a growing international character among cable series that win their place on the programming schedule by lowering the risk and cost for the U.S. network through premium license fees extracted from foreign buyers.

I feel like no one in the states knows about this show (it airs on Epix), but that may hardly matter. Set your show in Europe, give it opportunities like this for additional revenue."
Berlin Station,Its something to watch but its not engrossing.
Berlin Station,Season one was much better than season 2 imho
Berlin Station,"Im the only one in my social group that has watched it. Its a great show, much better then homeland in my opinion"
Berlin Station,"its pretty good. 

id like to see a crossover between this show and **Le Bureau**...."
Berlin Station,"Is it an ""adult"" show? I've never heard of Epix before. These kinds of shows are always so lame in PG13/network settings."
Berlin Station,It is. They also have the airing rights in the US for Deep State. Both are adult espionage shows.
Berlin Station,I love this show and wish it got more love on reddit
Berlin Station,As a Berliner: I quite enjoy the series too. It even makes sense from a geographical perspective - which is quite rare in films that take place in Berlin (*totally* not looking at you Homeland...). Apparently they hired a lot of locals and it really shows. 
Berlin Station,Where can I stream this?
Berlin Station,It's great. Finished it yesterday. Now I just need shows with this vibe.
Berlin Station,The latest season of homeland was amazing. I encourage you to give it a try
Berlin Station,"I don't know. It's an American production with a US/UK cast for a show that takes place in Berlin. That sounds pretty bad. 

I liked Deutschland 83, as the show at least had a German cast and felt authentic. Must US productions about Europe are just US cliches about Europe with US actors failing at speaking German (or any other continental European language)."
Berlin Station,"I guess it makes sense being on Epix. I do hope the few that have Epix are watching. If the show and the channel can do well enough to support a few more seasons I'll be happy. Maybe *Get Shorty* can help raise the tide over there. 🤞

edit: it recently got [picked up](http://variety.com/2017/tv/global/miptv-berlin-station-nordic-region-spain-italy-1202017650/) by a trio of European networks, so maybe it's doing well internationally?"
Berlin Station,"Just curious, what do Berliner think of such shows/films shot there? i fell in love with Berlin after a trip there in April, and discovering this show, makes me miss Berlin even more. 

And I am a huge Homeland follower too:)"
Berlin Station,"In the US you'll have to go through Epix, for which you can do a free trial month"
Berlin Station,Outside US / in Europe the show is on Netflix
Berlin Station,"I thought it was mediocre at best. I don't understand why the returned to the US and made it all about US politics especially as they clearly expected Hillary to win and then they did this weird ""female Trump with some Hillary elements"" president. Also the writing and directing was kind of poor. E.g. they never really explained why Dar behaved the way he did. Or why they added the weird sexual abuse stuff that was just random and added nothing to the plot. Peter being a vegetable all season was great either. Also many scenes were crap, like the ""cabin in the woods night attack"" where supposedly top notch special agents fire randomly into the forest and are incapable of operating their guns. 

I don't know, Homeland is a bit like TWD. It has its moments but then they always mess up and are never consistently good. Season 1 was the best one and ever since the show is kind of mediocre. E.g. the season in Pakistan was awesome but then for no fucking reason they killed half of the characters they build up over 2-3 season and ended it with the worst finale ever."
Berlin Station,"Hence the title, that US/UK cast play American characters who work for the CIA's Berlin Station. The German characters look to be played by Germans. And of course it's got a heavily German crew as well having been shot there. I buy it."
Berlin Station,Pretty sure all the characters working for German intelligence/media were played by Germans. 
Berlin Station,"I was watching a show recently and a character made a comment that the only premium channel that they had was EPIX.  Given that BS and GS are on it, I could live with that."
Berlin Station,"Homeland was largely ok. The Bourne-films too. Berlin Station is even more ""accurate"". Atomic Blond (just watched it yesterday) - now that made me cringe."
Berlin Station,"Homeland for me died when Carrie outed Brody at the hotel (early season 2).  I was so hoping for a real spy show, where they used Brody to feed bad info, and then Brody figures out what was happening and starts to feed bad info to Carrie, who then works out that the info is bad, she she then doubles back on Brody who doesn't realize that they know that he knows.   Sort of a modern Spy Who Comes in from the Cold series of redirects.  But no, they go cheap and blow it.  So BS was nice to see as a show with actual spycraft.  To many spy shows fall into the politically correct well.  There is nothing glamorous or moral about the spy game, and Hector has just been the most fun character of all to watch.  Hector to spying is what Captain Willard was the the Army.  And yes, Homeland got caught with their pants down after the election.  ;*)  To bad they purged all the good right wing writers from Hollywood.  leftists with good intentions just can't cut it.

And as to the reference to Get Shorty.  Easily a top-5 show this season.  What a 10 ep ride, and just a perfect lead into the second season.  O'Dowd should get the Emmy for ep 9, IMHO, and Romano a nom at least for ep 10.   The comedians do make the best drama actors. "
Berlin Station,Agree. Atomic Blond was just a bland feminist take on badass spy.
Berlin Station,"Yep. But what I meant was: as a Berlin native that movie made me cringe because pretty much all the architecture you see in the movie - aside from some landmarks - was very, very wrong. My guess is they shot it in Budapest or some other eastern European city.  I realize, most people won't care, but its a bit like seeing streets with timber frame houses in a movie that is supposed to take place in London. "
Berlin Station,"Understood.  I'm big fan of the Bourne franchise and the Berlin scenes in these movies were interesting to me and so I started looking up Berlin on the internet and found it to be a beautiful place. 

Berlin's Train station is on top of my ""to see list"" if I ever get to visit Berlin. "
Berlin Station,"I think the reason few people are talking about it is because of where it airs, Epix airs it in US and I don't think many people know of Epix"
Berlin Station,One of my favorites this year along with Patriot and Get Shorty
Berlin Station,"Sorry, the pilot bored me."
Berlin Station,Wasn't the biggest fan of the first season since it had like every spy cliche in it. Second season was amazing though and more than made up for it.
Berlin Station,i love this show. finished both seasons in a week. 
Berlin Station,"Yes, It's on HBO Nordic in Europe and that's probably not even available outside scandinavia.

"
Berlin Station,"Yeah EPIX and Starz often get their series left out of discussions because they simply don't reach a wide viewerbase in the states. Black Sails managed to catch a decent word of mouth promotion in its later seasons, but it's still relatively unknown compared to if it was on HBO. "
Berlin Station,If it's anywhere near get shorty quality I'm watching. I thought Patriot had some issues but I loved the concept.
Berlin Station,"Ha, I thought the opposite, preferred S1 to S2. To each their own"
Berlin Station,I’m trying to find reasons to watch past episode 3. Maybe I’ll just start season 2
Berlin Station,"~~His Strategy  
Step 1 : Fuck with Ash vs Evil Dead.  
Step 2 : Cancel Counterpart.  
Step 3 : ???  
Step 4 : Profit~~  
  
Misread the title. Nevermind."
Berlin Station,wrong network
Berlin Station,Whoops.
Ari Shaffir: Double Negative,Replacing Ari Shaffir with Roy Wood Jr. was not a good fit. The show was developed by Ari and fits perfectly with Ari's weird personality.
Ari Shaffir: Double Negative,I liked him better when he was silent Bob

Ari Shaffir: Double Negative,Fuck Ari Shaffer.
Ari Shaffir: Double Negative,The OA cancelation made me not too happy.
Ari Shaffir: Double Negative,"Lilyhammer, one of the first! Also personal fan of Hemlock grove"
Ari Shaffir: Double Negative,"My top 10

- 1st Dark

- 2nd Russian Doll

- 3rd The Queen's Gambit

- 4th Narcos

- 5th Stranger Things

- 6th Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency (BBC America coproduction)

- 7th The Woman in the House Across the Street from the Girl in the Window

- 8th Sense8

- 9th Unorthodox

- 10th Black Mirror (S1-S2 are from Channel 4, S3-S5 are Netflix Original)

My watchlist (what I'm going to watch next): Ozark, Inside Job, Godless."
Ari Shaffir: Double Negative,No love for the Mike Flanagan shows?
Ari Shaffir: Double Negative,"I think Netflix has really become disappointing in recent years. When they first got into original programming, they would develop these really amazing shows that were unlike anything else on television. But ever since they cancelled Sense8, they have started premiering more average programming. 

My favorite Netflix originals:

1. Bojack Horseman: Became one of my all-time favorite shows rather quickly and really revolutionised for me what adult animation can do. 6 almost flawless seasons and I think it should have gone one for 1-2 more seasons.
2. Orange Is The New Black: I am generally a huge fan of shows with female leads, and this was really one groundbreaking and entertaining show. I feel like its impact and popularity is almost forgotten by now, but I think it was one of the shows that really defined what streaming could do. I also think it found a great ending. 
3. Sense8: This was not a perfect show, but a beautiful concept, connecting people from different backgrounds and promoting international friendships, which few shows do. Additionally, it was pretty amazing to actually see a show shoot in all these different locations all over the world.
4. Glow: Again, I really love female-centred shows and this was no exception. Great performances by a great cast all around.
5. Russian Doll: Same as Orange Is The New Black or Bojack Horseman, I think Russian doll really drives home the fact that streaming services like Netflix can tell different stories from traditional outlets.
6. Tuca and Bertie: It died too sun on Netflix, but thank god it was revived on Adult Swim. Different enough from Bojack Horseman to stand on its own, but sharing a lot of the same sensibilities that made Bojack fun.
7. The OA: Again, this is not a perfect show for me, but what I really loved about this show was how different it was from your usual fare and how different the story was told. It felt more like a good book than a TV series, which many streaming series aspire to, but really actually achieve in doing.
8. Dead to Me: This show is not as great as many of the others, but the chemistry of the two leads is iressistible.
9. Stranger Things: A little bit overhyped, but creative.
10. Jessica Jones: My favorite of the Marvel shows. (Actually the only one I watched more than one season of.)"

Ari Shaffir: Double Negative,Iweather you have or have not watched bojack I urge you to reconsider
Ari Shaffir: Double Negative,">When They See Us

One of the hardest shows to watch. Damn I felt bad for them."
Ari Shaffir: Double Negative,Dark should be top this list
Ari Shaffir: Double Negative,"There are a lot more Netflix originals that I really like that unfortunately didn't make the list: Unorthodox, Mindhunter, The Queen's Gambit, Quicksand (Störst av allt), Unbelievable, Altered Carbon, Sintonia, Bridgerton, Easy etc.  
  
Also, as for other acquired/co-produced content that I chose to not put on the list: Alias Grcae, Kalifat, Parfum, La Casa de Papel, La cocinera de Castamar, Crash Landing on You etc. are all great television.  
  
*But anyways, since this is a pm\_me\_reason\_to\_livx list, ya kno what I gotta do....*

Here are my specific praises for shows on this list:  
  
**Best concept** — Sense8 \[runner-up: - Squid Game\]

Ari Shaffir: Double Negative,OITNB is great. I watched the first 4 seasons.
Ari Shaffir: Double Negative,[deleted]
Ari Shaffir: Double Negative,I see you haven’t watched bojack horseman in my opinion that is the best Netflix original
Ari Shaffir: Double Negative,What's going on with that Master of None write up?
Ari Shaffir: Double Negative,[deleted]
Ari Shaffir: Double Negative,"Thanks, cool list! Some shows I havent heard before"
Ari Shaffir: Double Negative,I would say that Babylon Berlin and BoJack Horseman are the best.
Ari Shaffir: Double Negative,"Way late to this post but definitely recommend “the last kingdom” one of their best shows, just finished its last season and then will end with a movie. Also the show “russian doll” had a fantastic s1 and returns for s2 in 1 day, highly recommend that one as well, very quick watch too because it’s 30m episodes and only 8 per season."
Ari Shaffir: Double Negative,"Maid, Unbelievable and Mindhunter."
Ari Shaffir: Double Negative,I loved Hemlock Grove.
Ari Shaffir: Double Negative,"Lilyhammer was so good. But unfortunately it was cancelled too soon, the show does not have an ending :("
Ari Shaffir: Double Negative,I like The Haunting of Hill House a lot.
Ari Shaffir: Double Negative,"I've seen everyone of those besides Between, Helix and Cobra Kai. And I'm almost sure they're not Netflix originals."
Ari Shaffir: Double Negative,Bloodline season 1 was one of the best seasons of television I’ve ever seen. Unfortunately season 2 killed it and 3 buried it in an unmarked grave. Should have been a limited series.
Ari Shaffir: Double Negative,It's the reason why I haven't given it a rewatch yet. I just can't bare all that pain again.
Ari Shaffir: Double Negative,Ah feel ya. *But Desenfrenadas tho*.
Ari Shaffir: Double Negative,[deleted]
Ari Shaffir: Double Negative,"You know, 100+ Netflix series yet I've never actually seen House of Cards. lol. I must acknowledge it though because it's one of the most popular Netflix OGs. But personally, politics? Big *naaaaaaah* for me."
Ari Shaffir: Double Negative,Because it's bad
Ari Shaffir: Double Negative,I've watched Bojack Horseman.
Ari Shaffir: Double Negative,"*I don't know what they want from me, it's like... the more money we come across, the more problems we seeeeee!*"
Ari Shaffir: Double Negative,"lol, this comment. check some out tho."
Ari Shaffir: Double Negative,"One of the first chopping block regrets, but not the last"
Ari Shaffir: Double Negative,Between and Cobra Kai are Netflix originals. Helix is a cancelled Syfy series.
Ari Shaffir: Double Negative,I never plan to rewatch it. Ain't going through that again.
Ari Shaffir: Double Negative,"Yea I've seen Marco Polo. The closest thing to it I guess is Kingdom. Vikings Vanhalla is close to that time period as well, but I think it's *where* Marco Polo is set that makes it unique and not *when*."
Ari Shaffir: Double Negative,Man the first season is peak television
Ari Shaffir: Double Negative,"Great list----there are only six of the shows you listed, including Desafrenadas, that I've never heard of, but they definitely sound worth checking out because of your descriptions of them. Here's a couple of faves of mine on Netflix, some of which I didn't finish before they got taken off, and some I haven't finished yet, along with one I'd like to see, and haven't seen yet:

1.The Protector----a Turkish fantasy-thriller that lasted four seasons, with 10 half-hour episodes for each season. It's about a young guy who runs a shop with his father, who discovers after a tragedy that he's been chosen as the Protector, and that he's part of an ancient people with superpowers who fight the demons, called the Immortals, that are trying to take over the world. I've seen only one season so far, but it was pretty good, and fun to see a fantasy action series with a Turkish take on it.

2. Paranormal--- Netflix's second Middle Eastern series (after their first one, a Jordanian series called Jinn, which lasted one season). It's set in 1960s Egypt (where it was actually shot, because it's based on a popular series of horror books by an Egyptian author, Ahmed Tawfik.) It's about a hemotologist and college professor named Refaat Ismail who finds himself literally haunted by ghosts from his past, even tough he dosen't believe in the supernatural. He also finds himself caught up in a whirlwind of curses and supernatural terror anyway soon after he comes in contact with a mummy that he winds up stealing to de-curse it, along with another man who's trying to stop the mummy from cursing everything else around it. He, the dude trying to do the un-curses, and his crush, another professor named Maggie, wind up going to the desert, being chased by demon creatures and haunted by other things. Really fun and lively old-school show, only six episodes. It's supposed to get a second season later this year---I enjoyed the first season, so looking forward to the second.

Liked three of the Marvel shows----Luke Cage, Jessica Jones, and Daredevil---but my laptop conked out the same week all three shows were leaving Netflix for Disney Plus and I didn't get a chance to finish watching them, lol.

La Reina del Sur---a Mexican drama about a woman who winds up on the run after her drug dealer boyfriend is murdered to another country, where she winds up being too close to some more major drug and trying to keep her head above water. This long-running popular telenovela inspired a reboot of the series back around 2017, I believe, and an American version of the show called Queen of the South. It's very exciting and action-packed all way."
Ari Shaffir: Double Negative,"Cobra Kai wouldnt count for this list because the first season aired on youtube, i think"
Ari Shaffir: Double Negative,"For real-----even though I'm old enough to recall when the real case jumped off back in the day, and even after seeing the Ken Burns documentary that finally told the Central Five's side of their stories---When They See Us, which was very well made, was still difficult as hell for me to watch, knowing that these young boys--which is exactly all they were, no matter how demonized and hatefully stigmatized they were at the time, mainly because they were black---were going to jail and put through literal hell for a crime none of them committed. Yeah, they survived, but some of them still bear the scars of what they went through, and what it took to survive that, even today.

The second youngest of the Exonerated Five, as they now are able to call themselves, Yuself Salaam, wrote a book last year about his experiences called Bitter, Not Better: Living In The Pursuit Of Racial Justice, that's worth reading. Here's a review of it: [One Of The Falsely Accused Five Tells His Story](https://www.npr.org/2021/05/18/997792060/in-better-not-bitter-one-of-the-central-park-five-tells-his-own-story)"
Ari Shaffir: Double Negative,Actually a better comparison is Medici as a historical drama about real life characters and one I notice often gets left out of these discussions
Ari Shaffir: Double Negative,"I'm just saying that Cobra Kai is a Netflix original, I did  not say that Cobra Kai counts for OP list. It doesn't count because OP is excluding Netflix originals that did not start on Netflix, like Black Mirror."
Ari Shaffir: Double Negative,"Sure, just wanted to clarify that you guys seem to be operating under different definitions"
Ari Shaffir: Double Negative,"Not really, he said that those three shows are not Netflix originals, which is incorrect."
Ari Shaffir: Double Negative,"It sounds like in some places you just missed the point entirely. 

Jet was a character designed to morally challenge the main characters. His motivations, hatred of the Fire Nation, were correct, but he went so far out of his way that regular people were being put in harm’s way. It makes our main characters re-evaluate their conflict and their own actions.

Aang’s blue tattoo isn’t because he’s an Avatar, it’s because he’s an air nomad, and most people really don’t care to notice him. Whenever they go into enemy territory, where people *would* recognize him, especially towards the end when he goes to the Fire Nation, he wears a disguise or hides himself.

Zuko and Azula’s character arcs are really well done by the end. Azula went completely crazy as a result of wanting to be desired and praised by her father (which was never going to happen), and Zuko learned to move beyond hatred and anger and found forgiveness in his heart. He finally moved past his own self-hatred like Iroh pleaded with him to. Their final Agni Kai isn’t just a big explosive action scene, it’s representative of an internal battle for Zuko, as he’s fighting against someone that is as ruthless and angry as he used to be. Katara saving the day & helping Zuko is also representative of her finally forgiving him instead of resenting him for what he had done. They finally became true friends in that moment. 

Both Zuko and Aang’s stories are mature. Aang’s people are dead, he’s a child, oh and by the way he’s been told his whole life how he has to save the world or else it’ll die. He acts childish as a coping mechanism for the unbelievable stress of being “the chosen one” at age **10**.

Sokka’s plans are oftentimes stupid and don’t work at the start, hence why nobody listens to him. His entire character arc is learning to be a good soldier, but an even better leader. By the end of the show, his plans work and are even the key to saving the day a number of times. He *is* the comic relief character, but it’s because he has to learn to grow up and stop “playing” soldier. By the end he is a mix of funny and serious in a way that he wasn’t before.

The magic system IMHO is liked because there is no “best power”. Every power is balanced, powerful, and yet weak when confronted with other factors, and even the most powerful abilities like lightning-bending are extremely dangerous and could kill the user. It’s also a visually exciting system as it combines magic & martial arts, leading to visually stunning moments.

Finally, the finale of the show is literally the culmination of everything it’s set up. Aang has finally mastered the elements, and Ozai is in his most powerful state thanks to Sozin’s comet, which is always how the show was going to end from day one. The “life-bending” from the Lion-Turtle isn’t a deus ex machina, it’s a skill the character learned in an earlier episode that was not shown to the audience to make for a great reveal. If Aang had life-bended without the island episode & Lion-Turtle setup, then it would’ve been a deus ex machina. Furthermore, his taking away of Ozai’s bending is hugely impactful, because he finally found a way to stop him without killing him, as everyone told him he was supposed to do. Life-bending itself isn’t without consequence either, TLA & Korra both show that it is a grave and irreversible punishment, but it shows that Aang has grown to be mature enough to accept that he has to do what needs to be done, but does not need to go overboard. 

You don’t have to like it, everyone is entitled to an opinion, but to post this haughty word salad of a post on here and then to tack on the “I can name ten animated shows far superior” at the end just makes it seem like you’re farming for outrage. Like it or don’t, but don’t come on to Reddit and act like you’re some trailblazer for having an opinion."
Ari Shaffir: Double Negative,It's pretty good for being a kids cartoon
Ari Shaffir: Double Negative,"I used to think it was overrated too.

Then I watched it."
Ari Shaffir: Double Negative,Its actually one of the best written cartoons of all times with an extremely well thought out story arc that incorporated a rich backstory with characters with clear motivations that is very hard to duplicate. Almost every character and location is a full fleshed out idea and could be its own show.
Ari Shaffir: Double Negative,"I’ve seen it mentioned that Combustion Man didn’t stop because by that point it was personal. Having lost a group of kids twice already he wanted to take them out. 

An Earth bender could have taken out the Fire Nation capital, but perhaps they want minimal collateral. Fire Nation works just take everyone out, but that doesn’t mean other nations would. 

Admiral Zhao vs the fish. They were the moon and the ocean spirit. They’d taken on a physical form on Earth so by killing the moon spirit, Zhao effectively broke the moon and water bending. 

Wood is not a bendable item. That was the whole issue with that jail cell

Azula had hinted in The Island (or whatever the episode was called) that there were skeletons in her closet where she says my own mother thought I was a monster. Then there’s the whole party scene that happened where she opens up to Ty Lee. After The Day of Black Sun she comes after Zuko. You can argue there that she has begun to slip. Then there’s The Boiling Rock where she loses Mai and Ty Lee and then Sozin’s Comet where the one person she had also leaves her. That all leads into her paranoia and her collapse

Jet was being blinded by his hatred for the Fire Nation, going after the innocent. His crew were trying to tell him that sometimes you should let things go. Katara and Aang were too naive that she trusted him when she shouldn’t have

The Great Divide wasn’t that good. However, spiders in real life can climb vertical objects. Avatar doesn’t have real life animals in it (other than the Earth King’s bear , Bosco) so who knows what they can do. Also, you’re complaining about realistic physics in a show where bending and spirits exist

As for Ozai, didn’t they have a whole scene where they realised the guy is just a normal looking dude from his baby photo. That was probably to show that anyone can end up a bad guy. The episode where there was that dance party was more of the same really. Showed that not everyone in the Fire Nation is bad.

Downvote guy and the turtle was pulled out of nowhere

Katara did ruin the Agni Kai but I’ve heard it said that by attacking Katara, that’s where Azula lost. She broke the rules

Which of Zuko and Aang’s story is childish? One deals with genocide and the other abuse. Nothing childish here"
Ari Shaffir: Double Negative,"You raise some good points. For example, the deus ex machina ending is definitely a popular criticism of the show. It helps that Korra does a good job using it, and it fits into the themes of Atla. But it's definitely a valid criticism.

What isn't though is the vast amounts of minor nitpicks you have about the show. It's not that it's exactly bad to have them, but they take up too much of your argument, they are really minor details that every show has, and especially a lot of them can easily be explained in the show itself. 

The wooden cage criticism is especially bizarre. The fire benders know it's prisoners are earth benders. It makes complete sense to lock them in there for the time being. That season has also shown many times that other nation bender's live in the fire nation. So I'm not sure why you're confused they have wooden cages. 

Boom man is another example. I'm not sure how more obvious the show can make it that he has a personal vendetta again the gang. 

For future reference I would stay away from nitpicking. It's really hard to do correctly and just weakings your overall argument.

Also you should definitely try checking out Korra it's in my opinion a way better show. While the overall show is not as consistent as Avatar. It does a lot of more interesting things in its characters and plot than Avatar ever attempted."
Ari Shaffir: Double Negative,Hello 30 yo guy who just found out Avatar.
Ari Shaffir: Double Negative,"Eh, I'm a fan of Avatar and I think it's overrated. In terms of children's cartoons (90% of which are trash & have no thought put into them), it's the GOAT, but I don't think it's the best show ever made. I don’t even think it's a masterpiece."
Ari Shaffir: Double Negative,">  I can name 10 right away that are far superior.

Yes, do that, at least this post will give me a watch list then."
Ari Shaffir: Double Negative,"I agree with you in regards to comedy, it falls in to those constant anime tropes. That was my only criticism."
Ari Shaffir: Double Negative,"I enjoyed it. It was definitely a kid's show as you never truly felt that the main characters were in peril.

You're right about Azula's turn to crazy being a 1 episode thing - it came on fast like in Game of Thrones when Dany turned evil for reasons to wrap up the show.

I still enjoyed it for what it is."
Ari Shaffir: Double Negative,[deleted]
Ari Shaffir: Double Negative,"Most of this is so wrong lol. But I’m only going to address the Azula part. She was starting to lose it even before the finale. Once Mai and TyLee betrayed her she became increasingly paranoid and stressed. So much to the point her bending style changed. Notice as early as the southern raiders she started using closed fists when firebending. She never did that anytime else prior, it was always two fingers. Also, her facial expressions and the things she was saying were definitely out of character. It progressively got worse until she started hallucinating and then having a full breakdown after losing in the finale.

You’ve seemed to have missed A LOT of detail in this show overall and made some very bold statements that indicated you didn’t really pay attention or understand a lot of the episodes or characters.For example somehow you think Sokka was supposed to be the equivalent of a comedian. No, Sokka was cringey as hell and downright awkward. He wasn’t mean to be actually funny lol. Or even questioning why combustion man didn’t stop when Zuko ordered him too…. like dude Team Avatar had already injured him by that point and it was personal. Besides, the fire lord would’ve rewarded him far more than Zuko ever could have. 

Therefore, I don’t think your judgment can be accurate. Also… Appa didn’t fly super fast across the avatar universe. It took them weeks on end just to get from the northern air temple to the northern water tribe. But your opinion is your opinion I guess. And.. that’s all I’m going to touch out of your essay lol."
Ari Shaffir: Double Negative,"I think they HAD to be able to look at the eclipse, so that they could know when it was about to end and be prepared for the fire nation soldiers getting their powers back.

It's about knowing how much time you've gt in such a critical mission."
Ari Shaffir: Double Negative,"I guess you are right about Jet but he should've been in series longer or atleast his death should've had more impact.

And I can see your Katara not listening to Sokka, but he has had great plans too.

Katara had already forgiven him, there was an entire episode dedicated towards that, that doesn't justify the moment she stole from Zuko and my problem isn't that Azula became crazy but she did it in like one episode, having authority can possibly make her crazy but not so fast.

I know Aang's childish he's 10. I'm just saying the feel and tone of his story doesn't flow well with Zuko's many times.

Yeah still not a fan of bending, Earth Bending just felt way too OP for me.

Spirit bending is dues ex machina, It literally fits perfectly in the definition of a dues ex machina, Aang has a conflict what do we do? Conveniently gets a power that allows him to win without killing Ozai, not only has Aang already killed before this conflict just came out of nowhere. Aang didn't went out to learn it or anything, he just was swept away and he got it from the turtle, he just got it. Keeping it a surprise doesn't make the moment better. Just because we saw scene with Aang & lion turtle doesn't mean it's not a Deus ex machina anymore.

Here's a video that might explain it better 
https://youtu.be/jdBnR_Dx4ow

And farming for outrage really? Anyone with different opinions than you is farming for outrage now? I literally gave the positives of the show at first and never called it a horrible show, even if I had I can have my opinion that a show is garbage or a masterpiece, and I literally gave reasons on why I think it's overrated unlike what people at r/unpopularopinions do"
Ari Shaffir: Double Negative,"Yeah I agree, but it's not one of the best shows ever, it isn't even one of the best animated shows imo"
Ari Shaffir: Double Negative,I used to think it was great. Then i watched it and didn't like it.
Ari Shaffir: Double Negative,Opposite for me
Ari Shaffir: Double Negative,"I watched twice(One alone, one with my girlfriend), yeah is one of the best cartoons produced ever in America, but that shows how bad the system is.  


Personally, I wouldn't say is a 9.2 in imdb, maybe a 8.5 at most, but even stuff like regular show is better than Avatar."
Ari Shaffir: Double Negative,If this is one of the best written cartoon there must not be that many great cartoons then
Ari Shaffir: Double Negative,"Combustion man was literally doing that for money and Zuko told him he'd pay more.

Jet was a good character that could've been fleshed out so much more, he just died and no one remembers him now.

Wood isn't bendable but you are in """"fire"""" nation, do you still don't get the problem?

IDC what Katara did that was Zuko's moment, not hers. Didn't Zuko just learned a pure form of fire bending? So that shouldve been used.

Zuko's story is mature while Aang's story is childish, they are just having fun meeting fun characters and occasionally running in problems.

The turtle thing and his conflict just came out of nowhere."
Ari Shaffir: Double Negative,"That's the thing some shows or stories try bigger and more ambitious things and fail in parts but does many things right, I'd take that way more than a show perfectly going from a to b predictably

And how more accurate can show than boom man is against the gang? Let him say Zuko screw your money, I'm gonna kill them that's it.

Yeah some of the points really are small but I did also say about big things like disappointing characters"
Ari Shaffir: Double Negative,"18*

Edit: Why am I getting downvoted to tell my real age and correcting this person?"
Ari Shaffir: Double Negative,">90% of which are trash & have no thought put into them

:/"
Ari Shaffir: Double Negative,"Genius, So

Gravity Falls

Courage and the Cowardly Dog

FMAB

Rick & Morty

Peak Simpsons

Code Geass

Steins Gate

Clone Wars"
Ari Shaffir: Double Negative,"> The magic system annoyed me as they turned into wizards and not martial artists.  
  
The show convincingly portrays bending as an extension of a bender's limbs rather than simple spellcasting. It even showcases different bending styles (compare Toph's bending to the average earthbending, or Azula's bending to Zuko's)."
Ari Shaffir: Double Negative,"Harry Potter actually did start very weak but it got better and better, really kicked the high gears from Prisoner of Azkaban. It's one of the best ya series out there and has many great characters.

Chosen one trope can work but didn't in Avatar for me."
Ari Shaffir: Double Negative,">Most of this is so wrong lol. But I’m only going to address the Azula part. She was starting to lose it even before the finale.

I guess, I don't remember lol

>Sokka was supposed to be the equivalent of a comedian. No, Sokka was cringey as hell and downright awkward. He wasn’t mean to be actually funny lol

No, he was always meant to be a comedic relief it's so obvious & Yes Sokka was cringey too. I like him but his comedy is just not upto the mark.

>Also… Appa didn’t fly super fast across the avatar universe. It took them weeks on end just to get from the northern air temple to the northern water tribe

I meant to say, It 'feels' like Appa moves really fast and the scale the show never convinced me the scale of the world at all."
Ari Shaffir: Double Negative,Makes sense tbh
Ari Shaffir: Double Negative,Jets death is one of the best scenes in the show.
Ari Shaffir: Double Negative,And  m night shyamalan is a stealing a living
Ari Shaffir: Double Negative,I think there is a lot of great adult cartoons to compare Avatar to now but at the time it was like comparing avatar to the Simpsons clearly there is a jump in quality. We have a lot of shows like avatar now both live action and cartoon but for a time it was really something special
Ari Shaffir: Double Negative,there aren't
Ari Shaffir: Double Negative,"The wooden jail cell was made to hold earth benders in. Similar to the metal ship prison and water bender prison, the fire nation was prepared to deprive other benders. Air benders couldn't be cut off so they killed everyone. 

Jet is the only character we encounter that died, I wouldn't say he is forgotten. He was a major representation for the increasing danger they faced. 

Zukos ""pure form"" of firebending is redirecting lighting, which he uses to save Katara when Azula attacks her. Because he almost doesn't make it, he still takes a major electric blow and if Katara didn't step in azula would have killed him. 

And as for Aangs story being childish, his 12. Him having to grow up too fast and being reluctant is a main plot point."
Ari Shaffir: Double Negative,"They wouldn’t use a wooden cell for a fire bending prisoner. They’d use something like the cooler at The Boiling Rock. 

Katara wasn’t smart in that Agni Kai, that is true. 

Perhaps downvote guy is in denial? Actually he was unaware until he found out a few episodes in. He got mad about it and the whole Avatar State happened. Then later it’s shown the Avatar State scares him so maybe he didn’t want to go to that place emotionally again? Also, different personalities between Zuko and Downvote Guy. One desperately wants approval from his father and what he feels is rightfully his, believing his nation is the best due to propaganda (…what a great lie that was. They hate us - Zuko, Day of Black Sun). 

The other, very much a kid and didn’t want that to change (Why didn’t you tell us you were the Avatar? Because I never wanted to be). See how the other monks’ treated him when it was revealed he was the Avatar? How decisions were being made for him by the adults. He didn’t want that responsibility so he wanted to hang on to the good times. 

I don’t think Aang takes a human life at any point in the show."
Ari Shaffir: Double Negative,">And how more accurate can show than boom man is against the gang? Let him say Zuko screw your money, I'm gonna kill them that's it.

I mean the show does do that. It has Zuko run up to him saying[""the mission is off"", ""I won't pay you if you continue"", and ""I'll pay double for you to stop.""](https://youtu.be/TbiqQecHzKo?t=201) As I said, I'm not sure how much more obvious they could make it.  

>Yeah some of the points really are small but I did also say about big things like disappointing characters

Sure, and those are valid points. But it makes it hard for others to get to those points after you bogged everything down with nitpicks.

>That's the thing some shows or stories try bigger and more ambitious things and fail in parts, I'd take that way more than a show perfectly going from a to b predictably.

Yeah, I definitely think you will appreciate Korra. It's very in line with that idea. It doesn't always succeed but when it does those moments are way better than anything found in Avatar."
Ari Shaffir: Double Negative,"They all hate you because dissenting opinions are frowned on here. Even when as thoroughly explained as yours. Personally, I never got the hype either. I got a few episodes in before realizing that it was only a show intended for small children, and I wasn't the target demographic. Based on the Reddit hype, I had wrongly assumed it was more an all ages show. Not that all ages couldn't enjoy it, but it's specifically geared towards children."
Ari Shaffir: Double Negative,90% of these shows came out after avatar or weren't airing in the US at the time. This is like saying Romeo and Juliet is not as good as twilight.
Ari Shaffir: Double Negative,Just running across this thread. Clone Wars is not even the best Star Wars cartoon. It doesn’t even come close to top 10 cartoons of all time.
Ari Shaffir: Double Negative,I think you just really like sci fi.
Ari Shaffir: Double Negative,[deleted]
Ari Shaffir: Double Negative,Which meant nothing for the show
Ari Shaffir: Double Negative,I've heard season 4 didn't happen because of his movie lmao
Ari Shaffir: Double Negative,"Well in my opinion: the tom and jerry show, courage the cowardly dog, dexters laboratory, Craig of the creek, then ren & stimpy show, invader zim, ninjago, the amazing world of gumball, any looney tunes show, adventure time, the regular show, apple and onion, spongebob squarepants. So basically what im trying to say is: there are"
Ari Shaffir: Double Negative,Standard is pretty low then
Ari Shaffir: Double Negative,"Yeah so you are making a jail in fire bending nation only for water benders? Who aren't even gonna be there?

Yeah idk wasn't a fan of Jet.

I'm not saying Aang is childish I mean he is, but his story and Zuko's story felt very different like two different shows. 

Zuko's pure form isn't lightning he didn't go there to learn lightning redirecting, he wasn't able to produce fire efficiently, he didn't see colorful lighting there he saw fire"
Ari Shaffir: Double Negative,"You dont think Aang took any human life??
Well https://youtu.be/PYmLKzgLbUo"
Ari Shaffir: Double Negative,"Idk atla fans hate that series too much. Maybe someday I'll watch it.

And yeah maybe you are right about the boom man, He was an actual threat lol like Azula which Aang never defeated, so unbelievable that Ozai isn't even in top 3 best villians of the series."
Ari Shaffir: Double Negative,People are downvoting because they are not thinking of the show in the context it was created. I can't think of many things before this time on American TV and especially for children come close to avatar.
Ari Shaffir: Double Negative,"“A few episodes in.” So…. the episodes before it even touches on grieve, misogyny, war, dishonor, genocide, or any of the characters developed / any world building happened…. wtf? It’s literally only childish for the first 8 episodes. There’s a reason it has a huge fanbase with a wildly varying demographic."
Friends from College,Netflix cancelling everything 
Friends from College,"Fox better watch out, Netflix coming for that cancellation crown."
Friends from College,DAMNIT I LIKED THIS SHOW
Friends from College,"And thus continues the vicious cycle of me waiting to watch a show until a few seasons are available out of fear that it'll get canceled with a cliffhanger, which means I'm not contributing to ratings, which affect whether or not a show gets cancelled."
Friends from College,"Noooo the cliffhanger! I guess I’m in the minority, but I thought this show was perfect"
Friends from College,"I mean didn’t see it going 10 seasons but one or two more would have been good. Decent cast. Good mix of humor, dark humor and drama. "
Friends from College,Seemed like an expensive show with the cast that they had. 
Friends from College,Fuck this. The second season was amazing. I was so looking forward to the third. Ugh.
Friends from College,"I know the critics hated it, but I really enjoyed it. Would've liked one more season to give it a proper conclusion."
Friends from College,"In general the motivations of the characters weren’t explained enough and it made the plot feel out of control and confusing. I could never tell who actually liked who or why, so it was hard to care about what happened. 

I still loved it though, their inside jokes and the particular bond you have with college friends was very spot on. I’m the same exact age as them and have similar jokes and cultural references etc with friends from that era so I really enjoyed this show. I mean the Monica Lewinski musicial? Amazing! "
Friends from College,[deleted]
Friends from College,Damnit! I LOVE this show
Friends from College,What? I watch the whole series twice. The episode where the guy tried to learn how to punch. I laugh just telling people about it. This is disappointing. 
Friends from College,"I am confused, did they even appear in any of Marvel Defenders series?
"
Friends from College,Please finish this!!!
Friends from College,I’ll be sad to see this one go. Same with The Netflix original “Love”. Both we pretty good. The first season of “Friends from College” took a bit to get going but after a few episodes into it I really started enjoying the characters and how they meshed with each other. 
Friends from College,"Wooooow way to leave it on a cliffhanger. Oh well. At least do a felix and max spinoff, they were my favorites. I'd watch a whole show of them. The rest can kinda fuck off"
Friends from College,"Nooooo what the fuck I love this show

&#x200B;"
Friends from College,I hope this show will rise from the ashes someday.
Friends from College,The show hadn’t any likeable character. Not surprised 
Friends from College,"i really enjoyed this show, i guess i’m a terrible person cause the characters were so relatable "
Friends from College,It kind of reminded me of a less funny You're The Worst but with no redeeming likeable values in any of the characters except for Billy Eichner. 
Friends from College,[deleted]
Friends from College,"I'm not surprised, I was pumped for the first season then it just turned out to be a teen drama with adults instead of teens. 

Don't they like lose a cat, then replace it with a similar cat just for the person to find the orginal cat? That's something I could easily see from like Boy Meets World when they were in elementary school and they use it as a lesson for not losing things, responsibility, and not lying. Instead its adult doing stupid stupid stuff.

"
Friends from College,Boo!!!
Friends from College,I liked it. Sad to see it go
Friends from College,I thought the show was good. I enjoyed it. Oh well 😔 
Friends from College,Damn I thought it was pretty funny
Friends from College,"Season one was so incredibly awful and disappointing. I love the cast so I'd had high hopes but wow, terrible. Haven't bothered with season two."
Friends from College,FUCK!
Friends from College,"Never even heard of it.  How much marketing did they have?  

Not enough, evidently."
Friends from College,"To me it was bad people do cringey things, the show. Bummer cuz the cast was great."
Friends from College,Damn. Just binged both seasons for the first time and really liked it. There was a Seinfeld-y vibe where nothing really happens but I liked most of the scenes and had few good laughs.
Friends from College,"I just started this show 3 days ago, and was starting to really enjoy it. Sounds like I will enjoy the most out of the last few episodes"
Friends from College,That sucks. I thoroughly enjoyed this show
Friends from College,That tennis scene still makes me chuckle.  
Friends from College,Nooo! 
Friends from College,"That's too bad.  I really liked that show.

&#x200B;"
Friends from College,American Vandal proved that it's killing season for Netflix and those sick bastards will show no remorse!
Friends from College,What the fuck!!?!? That was a great show 
Friends from College,"That show should have been called ""Poor Impulse Control."""
Friends from College,"Every single show I love on Netflix gets cancelled... this is the same thing I went through when supporting the oddball shows on FOX, NBC, and Syfy back in the  day... It hurts."
Friends from College,This show was terrible.
Friends from College,i saw 2 episodes. it was the opposite of a feel good show. it was a show about normal lives made terrible by horrible and selfish people making bad choices. why would anyone want to watch this? to make themselves feel like their bad choices are normal?
Friends from College,"I hated the first few episodes with a passion.

It's a waste of talent on such a mediocre plot and execution.

I just cringed whenever the characters did something that only furthered their bad situations like when the guy threw a fucking chair through a fucking window or a fucking bunny somehow fucking died and they fucking went and replaced it with one using fucking mascara! 

And the fucking bunny wasn't even fucking dead?!

Like, how fucking stupid can someone be?!"
Friends from College,Honestly who even watched this?😂
Friends from College,I thought it was good. Although I’m not sure how much deeper it could get. 
Friends from College,I really liked the show!
Friends from College,Big mistake smh 
Friends from College,I was surprised there was a second season.
Friends from College,Netflix keeps canceling all this stuff I never watch and don't care about
Friends from College,I don't think this is a surprise to anyone.
Friends from College,"I LOVED THIS SHOW. There’s only so much you can do in a world where “Young Sheldon” captivates the hearts and minds of America:(

Sigh."
Friends from College,I don’t understand why Netflix “cancels” shows. If they are concerned about building their library; they essentially make these cancelled series useless. Give them 4 episodes or an extended finale. 
Friends from College,"I actually thought this show was hilarious! Ahh, I’m gonna miss it!! How do they deal with the baby??"
Friends from College,This was one of the best show I watched recently . Somehow true to the life .
Friends from College,"Hello, Netflix. Yes you are approved/canceled. "
Friends from College,"Well, yeah.  It was an awful show. "
Friends from College,"damn, only finished watching this last night, i mostly enjoyed it :("
Friends from College,"i  actually really enjoyed this show. Hopefully fred savage gets more roles, he was good on this"
Friends from College,"NO! WHAT?! 

loved both seasons of this show. thought more was guaranteed. "
Friends from College,"Oh yeah, that show from my home screen that I ignore constantly"
Friends from College,"NOOOOOO! That show was ahead of it's time. Honest even in its wacky moments. 

Why is Netflix cancelling the good shows and going ahead with the bad? The movie selection here in Europe is getting worse. Might have to check out Hulu and see if it's worth my time changing. I just got a Nintendo switch too so maybe Hulu is the way to go."
Friends from College,Not surprise. Don’t really like the show and I stop watching it during half of the first season. 
Friends from College,I did not like the first season the show just felt awkward to me but I think it found its grove in the second season. Disappointed I won't see the ending.
Friends from College,I wish they gave all cancelled shows an extra episode to wrap it up.  There are too many shows that end on cliff hangers. It deters me from ever watching it (which seems bad for Netflix/streaming services in particular).
Friends from College,I just want the new season of Lucifer to hurry up and come out.
Friends from College,"Ok Netflix...you cancelled my MCU stuff...and when I thought we found a diamond in the rough, you cancel this too?"
Friends from College,Not surprised after season 2. I thought season 1 was funnier but it felt like the show went too deep to quick. They reeled you in with the comedy early then went full drama.
Friends from College,Oh man! I thought it was so good!
Friends from College,I have never heard of this show...
Friends from College,"Netflix better not cancel the umbrella academy next :(

That cliffhanger needs to be resolved"
Friends from College,Good. I thought it was going to be funny.
Friends from College,Dammit.
Friends from College,On a related note the future of the show “People at the Co-op” is uncertain
Friends from College,"Nooo!!! I loved this show. The character dynamics were hysterical, and the friend problems felt so real. I was looking forward to season 3. 

You canceled Happy Endings, now Friends from College, too?!? "
Friends from College,Not a surprise the show was mediocre at best.
Friends from College,"No! This ended on a cliff hanger too and it was such a good show. I wasn’t crazy about the first season, but I felt that there was so much potential after the second one aired! "
Friends from College,[deleted]
Friends from College,How many shows go past 2 seasons? I'm pretty sure they give new IPs two seasons in a standard contract. Why are people always surprised?
Friends from College,"I'm okay with this. Not a whole lot of loose ends, and the second season came together pretty nicely."
Friends from College,"Okay well this is a bummer, I just finished the second season this weekend."
Friends from College,"Actually enjoyed this show. No super heroes, no visual effects, just human interactions. "
Friends from College,That's too bad.
Friends from College,"This is such a drag. My gf and I just started watching this last week, and we love it. Bummer."
Friends from College,Any reason why they cancelled this show?
Friends from College,FUCK YOU NETFLIX
Friends from College,"Personally, not surprised. Tried to give it a go, but there were so many things I could not get past. The show seemed at times to try to go for dark humor, and other times sophisticated humor. And other times, especially with Keegan Key and that scene where he throws a chair through that window.... what was that?? It seemed so stupid and unrealistic. I mean, these people went to Harvard right? His solution to them being locked in that Foyer area was to throw a chair through glass?? Decent plot and some good moments with real comedic value but overall seemed scattered with no rhythm."
Friends from College,I'm surprised it got a second season. 
Friends from College,"Season 2 had one of the most baffling storytelling decisions I've ever seen: which is to fast forward and skip the conclusions of a bunch of storylines in Season 1, and just assume the viewer would get it.

Like, how characters broke up, infidelity revealed, and characters getting back was just implied to happen in the break between seasons. I had to seriously go back to season 1 finale, rewatch it, and then go to reddit to make sure I didn't miss it. This wasn't small stuff, it was where the emotional beats were building to."
Friends from College,That’s disappointing. I like this show. 
Friends from College,I'm onlyon the first season but I'm enjoying it. It's a bit different.
Friends from College,Honestly shocked it got a second season in the first place. 
Friends from College,Such a good show till the end of season one. They did exactly what you knew was gonna happen instead of being creative.
Friends from College,With all the cancellations I wonder why there was a an increase in there monthly service. What so we could get a bunch of half asked movies and tv shows. 
Friends from College,wake me up when Marco Polo gets un-cancelled
Friends from College,"Honestly surprised this even made it to a second season, all the characters are so terrible considering all the talent involved"
Friends from College,I loved the real awkward moments that turned into comedy gold on this show. I hope they find a home somewhere else! 
Friends from College,Did it at least have a nice conclusion? I just started the damn thing coz cobie smulders
Friends from College,"Noooooooo!   


Fuck man, I think about this show every day and I think its one of the best comedy shows i've ever seen. daaamn :("
In Another World With My Smartphone,"There's been quite a few pieces about the behind the scenes troubles of this series. Business Insider claims the show may have spent nearly 300 million dollars for three hours of content. The Hollywood Reporter reported that several writers and producers quit because the Russos had two competing versions of the series and couldn't decide which one they preferred. It's a mess, and the final product likely is going to be...well, worthy of the kind of movies the Russo brothers make for Netflix.

In Another World With My Smartphone,Amazon should be funding Richard Madden in Oasis.
In Another World With My Smartphone,"Isn't this exactly what they bought the Clancy franchise for? Jack Ryan, No Remorse, leading into Rainbow Six, and maybe Splinter Cell?"
In Another World With My Smartphone,"Ah yes the one of the most trusted spy tools. A shotgun... Can we please get a spy series that's more like Tinker Tailor, or the Americans, or something in the middle."
In Another World With My Smartphone,"Spy shows really took off lately, but it doesn't feel like that quality followed."
In Another World With My Smartphone,Madden was tremendous in Bodyguard. He needs a proper drama role.
In Another World With My Smartphone,Why is she holding her arms out like she's got those Black Widow wrist taser things on?
In Another World With My Smartphone,"> When head of Amazon Studios Jen Salke came to Joe and Anthony Russo with an unusual idea for a TV show, they were intrigued by the potential to do something brand-new. 


> **Salke imagined an action spy show that was the first-ever global TV series, with a main show and then local offshoots around the world, starring local talent.** It had never been done before, but that’s what the Russo brothers liked about it from the start. “Anthony and I have reached a point in our careers where the ambition is the compelling part of the approach for us,” Joe Russo tells Vanity Fair. “We’re looking for new ways to tell stories.”

> Through their production company, AGBO, the Russos embarked on a years-long journey to bring Citadel to life. **The Amazon series stars Richard Madden and Priyanka Chopra Jonas as elite spies who work for Citadel, a spy organization that has no allegiance to any country.** As seen in Vanity Fair’s exclusive first-look images, **the high-concept, action-packed spy thriller is set after the fall of the spy organization, when the two agents must attempt to piece together what happened. One of the main problems: Their memories have been wiped.** “This is secrets on steroids,” showrunner David Weil says. 

> **With standout supporting performances by Stanley Tucci and Lesley Manville, this ambitious new series will premiere its first two episodes on Prime Video on April 28.** It’s a big, bold swing—and it’s actually just the beginning, **with spin-off series already deep into production around the world.** “We’re not just creating a story, we’re creating this world that’s spanning countries and continents,” Madden says. “That can be daunting, but also super exciting.”"
In Another World With My Smartphone,"Good concept, lots of potential, but I'll go out on a limb and say that the two leads are actually the bad guys who contributed to the fall of the titular organization."
In Another World With My Smartphone,"This will be a hit like gray man and the other cop/military/detective shows on amazon but I hope it's good. While the spinoffs from other countries ideas sounds good on paper .....its all a bit much.

The Gray man was a waste."
In Another World With My Smartphone,Seriously how much more money does Jennifer Salke have to burn before Bezos fires her ass? Does she have blackmail photos on him? Did he get drunk at a party and touch her inappropriately or what?
In Another World With My Smartphone,I just want a second season of the bodyguard. So I'll begrudgingly watch anything with Madden in it to scratch that itch
In Another World With My Smartphone,"""Bodyguard"" was excellent."
In Another World With My Smartphone,"Ah, another attempt by prime to push appointment viewing; Nope, especially a spy show, gotta be able to binge and keep investment low"
In Another World With My Smartphone,The Russos are involved? This will be a gamble.
In Another World With My Smartphone,i'd rather that they had put more effort into carnival row.
In Another World With My Smartphone,"great, another ''ambitious'' series by Amazon smh"
In Another World With My Smartphone,"My guesses: the critics will hate it; reddit will find failure and argue endlessly; the ratings will be high, better than the ""darling"" shows, but this sub will not accept it. 

Until a new season of The Wheel of Time..."
In Another World With My Smartphone,Very excited for this show.
In Another World With My Smartphone,did she forget to grab a gun or what?
In Another World With My Smartphone,I hate how everything needs a million spinoffs nowadays. Especially before anything's been put out.
In Another World With My Smartphone,"I'm very excited for this, Madden is a must watch actor."
In Another World With My Smartphone,"Seems like it'll be an easy watch. A show like that, I feel like you can't make it too serialized, otherwise you'll deter people from jumping on. I'll check it out."
In Another World With My Smartphone,[deleted]
In Another World With My Smartphone,Richard Madden is difficult to watch in anything because he sucks so bad.
In Another World With My Smartphone,Check out the QR code in the last picture for a Teaser.
In Another World With My Smartphone,Amazon just churns out crap. It is really bizarre how the service just keeps misfiring.
In Another World With My Smartphone,How many times homeslice put 'Amazon' in the title of this post is 'interesting'.
In Another World With My Smartphone,Russo brothers only make sweet super spy movies that would have been too awesome as winter soldier sequels
In Another World With My Smartphone,r/citadel_tv
In Another World With My Smartphone,"I don't think any streaming service should be spending nearly $300 Million on *anything. Stranger Things* having a budget that big is a different story, its a lot but its also in its 4th season and its Netflix's premiere show. This is the first season and the show could flop and get cancelled. 

Meanwhile, I bet the first season of Reacher cost about a 10th of the budget of this show."
In Another World With My Smartphone,Massive failure.
In Another World With My Smartphone,"> 3 million dollars for three hours of content

That sounds cheap?"
In Another World With My Smartphone,A hundred million for 1 hour? WTF. Didn't the entire lord of the rings series with all the movies cost something like 250m - 300m? Or something close in that range.
In Another World With My Smartphone,"Well, The Grey Man was so generic and boring. Any hope of this being good is gone for me."
In Another World With My Smartphone,"This doesn't bode well for the Indian remake starring Samantha Ruth Prabhu and Varun Dhawan I guess. Though the Russos are just producing it, the show runners are Raj & DK who are superb"
In Another World With My Smartphone,I bet this show is going to be fun regardless of it’s past issues.
In Another World With My Smartphone,They should have done that one.
In Another World With My Smartphone,I’m still salty about that.
In Another World With My Smartphone,"It seems like Amazon has found a gap in the streaming market for the so-called ""dad shows"", and they're hitting it hard.

Reacher, Jack Ryan, The Terminal List, Citadel.  Probably Bosch/Bosch: Legacy fits into that niche as well.  They've got Cross coming soon, and that Terminal List prequel with Taylor Kitsch, and a Butch Cassidy show.  Probably some other stuff I'm missing."
In Another World With My Smartphone,"Okay, let me preface this by saying this is one of those, ""I know a guy..."" stories, so I don't blame anybody being skeptical of what I'm about to say, but I swear, I do know somebody who was involved with Jack Ryan at Amazon, and they are currently working on another Clancy project elsewhere. Long story short, Jack Ryan was dead before the fourth season was even announced as the final one. Hell, it was dead before they even started filming season three. It was a shitshow behind the scenes and John Krasinski is difficult to work with. They fast-tracked seasons three and four to shoot basically one after another because Krasinski wanted out of the show to focus on his directorial career. The odds of him popping up in any other Clancy-related media as Ryan are pretty low.

As for Amazon owning the Clancy ""franchise,"" I don't think that's really correct considering Michael B. Jordan's Rainbow Six movie is in development with Paramount (who unceremoniously dumped Without Remorse to Amazon in the first place), and the Splinter Cell animated show is going to be on Netflix. The Terminal List was a much bigger hit for Amazon than Jack Ryan, and seems like it probably cost Amazon a good bit less overall, too. Between that and The Boys, I do wonder if Amazon is starting to look more adapting newer IP instead of chasing legacy franchises, since most of their endeavors on that front (Jack Ryan, Rings of Power) haven't really been the shows driving people to their service, despite massive marketing campaigns."
In Another World With My Smartphone,Yeah but Jack Ryan only had one good season.  S2 was terrible.
In Another World With My Smartphone,"Are they still going ahead with Rainbow Six?

Without Remorse has to be the most forgettable movie in that genre."
In Another World With My Smartphone,"> Isn't this exactly what they bought the Clancy franchise for? Jack Ryan, No Remorse, leading into Rainbow Six, and maybe Splinter Cell?

Probably, but then they fucked it up really badly."
In Another World With My Smartphone,"I mean she’s armed with fists of fury, so he’s gotta up his game with some 12 gauge Beretta action."
In Another World With My Smartphone,You need to watch The Little Drummer Girl if you haven't already
In Another World With My Smartphone,"Malcolm In The Middle as a spy show?

I'm in."
In Another World With My Smartphone,"Slough House on Apple TV. Boom, you’re welcome"
In Another World With My Smartphone,Slow Horses is a phenomenal spy show
In Another World With My Smartphone,She’s doing Generic Action Lady stance
In Another World With My Smartphone,"Maybe they thought they were working for the good guys, but the Citadel turned out to be an evil organization, like The Alliance of Twelve (Alias), that’s why they set out to destroy it, to save the world!"
In Another World With My Smartphone,Madden was good in the Medici Netflix show as well
In Another World With My Smartphone,I’d rather Richard work on the supposed season 2 of that show instead of this imo.
In Another World With My Smartphone,"Prime really wants to break into “prestige” television on the level of HBO, but they’ve never quite been able to make a water-cooler show no matter how much money they throw at it. 

The closest they’ve come is The Boys, but even that isn’t on the level of HBO/classic AMC offerings. I wonder what the missing ingredient is."
In Another World With My Smartphone,"Carnival Row got hit by covid more than most, I wouldn't blame Amazon for that one."
In Another World With My Smartphone,"They kind of did, it's just not a popular genre"
In Another World With My Smartphone,"They're going to need very high ratings to justify the cost of this series. Supposedly the production costs were 160 million at a minimum.

I don't think it's going to be as popular as their other military thriller stuff like Jack Ryan and The Terminal List. No idea how the critics will see it."
In Another World With My Smartphone,Im waiting for him to get the lead in the next superman franchise
In Another World With My Smartphone,Priyanka has a huge following. People will definitely tune in for her.
In Another World With My Smartphone,"While her acting is atrocious in both her Bollywood and Hollywood outings, she has a huge fan base in India and they will watch."
In Another World With My Smartphone,">the final product likely is going to be...well, worthy of the kind of movies the Russo brothers make for Netflix.

They've only had 1 movie released for Netflix....so far. The Electric State might actually be good."
In Another World With My Smartphone,"Typo. It's actually (allegedly) 300 million dollars.

That doesn't sound cheap to me."
In Another World With My Smartphone,And that's saying something beings coked out/psychopathic Chris Evans is anything but generic & boring.
In Another World With My Smartphone,"That’s not a remake it’s a spin-off, those actors are in citadel"
In Another World With My Smartphone,I think the spin-offs will be fine but I can't see them doing more than one season of the main show if it's going to cost that much money for that little content each time.
In Another World With My Smartphone,"The Butch Cassidy show is also a franchise headed by the Russo brothers. This is why I doubt they're tied long term to the main version of Citadel, because they seemingly want to already start a new one.

I don't think this show is a ""dad"" show, though. It's too internationally focused for that. I don't see the dad types taking to Madden for a variety of reasons."
In Another World With My Smartphone,"Bosch is totally a dad show, its the only thing my dad has watched on his Prime account"
In Another World With My Smartphone,"Not sure if this is still happening but Michael Peña is supposed to guest star in the final season of Jack Ryan and his character get a spin off.

In Another World With My Smartphone,"ill check it out, thanks for the recommendation. these were just what came to mind tho"
In Another World With My Smartphone,Ty for the suggestion.
In Another World With My Smartphone,Just watched episode 1. very good. Ty for the suggestion.
In Another World With My Smartphone,"""Bringing you up to speed is like trying to explain Norway to a dog."" Lamb is such a dick but enjoyable to watch"
In Another World With My Smartphone,"Wasn't Marvelous Mrs. Maisel huge for a couple of seasons? And it got a ton of awards attention. Feels like that is their biggest hit to date, even more so than The Boys, but I'm basing that more off the number of every day people I saw talking about Maisel compared to The Boys, actual data might be a different story."
In Another World With My Smartphone,The terrible UI/UX can’t help.
In Another World With My Smartphone,Sad but true. This sort of fantasy tale is niche even among hardcore fantasy fans.
In Another World With My Smartphone,"how did they ""kind of"" put more effort into it than they actually did?"
In Another World With My Smartphone,You’re underestimating how massive the Russos and priyanka chopra are in India. I think this will be one of the biggest shows on Amazon.
In Another World With My Smartphone,Why would it not be popular? All the Russo Brothers stuff lately with the exception of Cherry on Apple has been well viewed. To not be a flop Citadel absolutely has to beat viewership numbers for The Terminal List. I’m also pretty sure they will be disappointed if it does not best Jack Ryan.
In Another World With My Smartphone,"That's James Cameron money, and I have this weird suspicion the Russos aren't going to give Amazon the bang for their buck that Cameron would."
In Another World With My Smartphone,"It is not.

The Get Down seems quite good value in retrospect."
In Another World With My Smartphone,"Oh okay, thanks for the correction"
In Another World With My Smartphone,"Well they were originally just producing *Citadel* AFAIK, and then swooped in and shitcanned the writers/directors and took over the project themselves.

I think the Butch Cassidy show is the same deal, the Russo's are EPs but they're not currently attached as writers or directors on it.

They've got a bunch of projects currently ongoing, including The Electric State for Netflix which they are directing."
In Another World With My Smartphone,"It's based on another le carré book and stars Michael Shannon, the hot Skarsgard and Florence Pugh. I think you'll love it."
In Another World With My Smartphone,Yea but I don’t think critical reception for the last two seasons has been as high. I’ve only watched the first two and really enjoyed them
In Another World With My Smartphone,"The other commenter gave the correct answer I think - critical/audience reception kinda tapered off.

And water-cooler show, I meant more like Game of Thrones, House of the Dragon, White Lotus, Last of Us, Ted Lasso, Stranger Things, Yellowstone kinda. Shows that have a strong social and cultural impact - Amazon has been trying hard to get something like that (most notably Rings of Power) for some reason despite their resources can’t seem to make it happen."
In Another World With My Smartphone,"They put a lot of effort into that show but it didn't get a whole lot of viewers compared to their other shows, also because their main audience is dad's."
In Another World With My Smartphone,"Huh, it’s almost like people watch whatever’s new on Netflix regardless of quality!

None of the people in this show are draws for the men who are expected to watch it. I have zero doubt that it will do worse than the Terminal List and Jack Ryan. JMO, of course"
In Another World With My Smartphone,"They won't and they aren't going to get that money back. Other than the reports on how much money this was costing, I have rarely seen this project even acknowledged since it was greenlit back in 2019. It has rarely been acknowledged as a project to look out for in 2023 or acknowledged by Amazon. I heard about The Rings of Power and Daisy Jones for months and months. 

I find it hard to believe that Amazon considers this a crown jewel at this point and their most promising program. They seem to be starting the PR from scratch."
In Another World With My Smartphone,"The Russos did a fantastic job on Infinity War and End Game, not trying to take anything away from them as I think those two films are an incredible achievement, but most of that money came from the franchise. They've got two of the highest grossing films ever, not because of their skill as directors, but because they filmed the MCU season finale.

Cameron will dream up his own 2 billion dollar movie for you  from scratch. I didn't even think the new Avatar movie was all that good, it was okay, I had fun, nothing special. But I'll still go see the next one, because I'm guaranteed a proper cinema experience. Cameron guarantees that, and the audience know it."
In Another World With My Smartphone,The Get Down was worth every penny!
In Another World With My Smartphone,The set me free song was a banger
In Another World With My Smartphone,"Their main problem is that their audience tends to be older and likely more conservative. They will watch the crap out of something like The Rings of Power and Jack Ryan (The Rings of Power whopped House of the Dragon in streaming ratings every week but one) but they won't talk about it online.

The Boys is their only real water-cooler show, I think. I don't think this show will break the pattern."
In Another World With My Smartphone,"and my comment was that i wish that they had put **more** effort into it than they actually had. which they didn't do, ""kind of"" or otherwise.

btw- why does your father have an audience..? are you orlando bloom's kid?"
In Another World With My Smartphone,"Folks do not watch whatever is new on Netflix. As seen by the failure of 4 of the last 5 English language shows released by Netflix in finding an audience (The Upshaws, Red Rose, Freeridge, and Lockwood & Co). 

Amazon also tend to miss with most of their shows. They do tend to do well with older male aimed action shows. Citadel fits that mould. It will also get a big marketing push as it will be Amazon’s biggest budget TV release of 2023. The Russo Brothers will be pushed more than the cast (though the cast are competent and not a turn off to the demo). Amazon have two international spinoffs of this show filming and two more in the works. They are invested in making this show work and getting behind it."
In Another World With My Smartphone,Yeah lol it premiere in 2 months and we have seen basically nothing from it. They were promoting Rings of Power or even stuff like Jack Reacher or The Boys more and earlier than this show.
In Another World With My Smartphone,"I took a survey about Citadel back in 2020 (The NDA was 2 years) holy shit I am surprised it is still in production, it was... uhhh... not the highest quality plot outline I read"
In Another World With My Smartphone,"IMO, they got lucky with Marvel.

Their subsequent projects have easily exposed their flaws."
In Another World With My Smartphone,"The Russos also directed The Winter Soldier early in their MCU career and it is widely considered the best movie in the entire franchise.  So filming the 'season finale' was a result of what they did earlier on, and that work was fantastic."
In Another World With My Smartphone,"To be fair, if people watch (and sub for) a show, it doesn't matter if it isn't talked about online."
In Another World With My Smartphone,"RoP didn't beat HotD overall, though. Higher streaming, but those figures didn't take into account the roughly 2mil viewers watching on HBO proper. Factoring the ENTIRE viewership into account RoP was the one getting whooped each week."
Castlevania, Such a great series. The action/fights are incredible.
Castlevania,"I really enjoyed Isaac's arc in the show.  Especially his conversations with Flyseyes.

If you'd like to watch one of them:

https://youtu.be/esYWVXrAeyA"
Castlevania,Isaac vs the mind controlling wizard in the tower was an all-time jaw-dropping fight.
Castlevania,"My friend and I watched this show together and we LOVED this episode!!  

The writing was phenomenal!!  We realized at the end that the whole episode was made up entirely of conversations, and we were probably more engaged than at any other point."
Castlevania," I like how he asked ""What happened?"" like he was disappointed Dracula's genocide failed lol"
Castlevania,Pick any of his voice acting roles . They’re all incredible
Castlevania,The Captain is an object lesson in Active Listening. He doesn't interrupt but places questions and quips to help the person he's talking to engage in telling their story.
Castlevania,"Ugh, Isaac is the worst character in that show. An insane, entitled, evil sociopath."
Castlevania,We need a spin off of just Isaac
Castlevania,Love this scene!
Castlevania,"Yeah the conversation where the demon is recounting his past life was legit unsettling, i also like his resolution with Hector."
Castlevania,Wish I had such a friend!
Castlevania,Did you just actually copy paste the top comment from the YouTube video? Wtf
Castlevania,"Any character that makes you hate them for what the reprehensible actions they're taking or for what a bastard they are within the show/movie/whatever is doing a good job with their writing.

""Aw man Darth Vader was such an asshole to everyone around him, worst character ever"""
Castlevania,You're thinking of the game version of Isaac.
Castlevania,"They're doing it for a bunch of different videos too, so they're probably a bot. Build up a bunch of positive karma reposting comments from videos and then it gets around spam filters when it eventually starts spamming links."
Castlevania,Yeah Isaac was fantastic and actually had a great arc... unlike Hector. The writers really did him dirty.
Castlevania,I'm not familiar with the history and lore as I've just seen the show but I was wondering how much time passes between the end of season 4 and Nocturne? How closely related is Richter to Trevor? Great grandson or even further down the line?
Castlevania,Lets goooooo! Rondo and Symphony make perfect sense.  Gives enough of a time gap after Trevor and can let them make some adjustments if necessary.
Castlevania,Yay! Season 4 of Castlevania had some of the best and most consistent animations I've seen in a show. The side characters also reached a great point like Issac.
Castlevania,"nice, cant wait for more castlevania"
Castlevania,Going to be tough to beat death as the last big bad though. Fucking killed that performance!
Castlevania,"He was removed from the series for obvious reasons, but I do genuinely wonder how much we'll feel the lack of Warren Ellis scripts in this season."
Castlevania,"I’m so excited for this, I finished Castlevania earlier this year and loved it."
Castlevania,"WHAT IS A MAN!….but a miserable pile of secrets?

It’s wild they’re skipping so much, but Richter is my boy"
Castlevania,"Glad the second series is coming soon, I wasn't expecting it for a while. Loved the first series despite how messy it got at times. 

Also hoping we get Alucard back, I can never get enough of James Callis."
Castlevania,">The series is led by showrunner Kevin Kolde and Creator/Writer Clive Bradley and produced by Project 51 Productions with production services provided by Powerhouse Animation. Castlevania: Nocturne follows Richter, a descendant of the Belmont family, popularized in the iconic Symphony of Night and Blood of Rondo Castlevania games."
Castlevania,"Awesome. Shame we won’t be getting more Issac, really would have been interested in seeing where his character went after S4, but hopefully this new cast will be great."
Castlevania,"I put off watching Castlevania until the last season started and I felt bad for waiting so long but so happy that I could just binge it.

I'm not even a big fan of the art style but loved it!"
Castlevania,Only thing that I disliked with season 4 was how they handled Hector and Lenore… made no sense as to why they killed her off
Castlevania,"I love this show to death, but it really does seem like they spend all of their best time writing for Isaac, and then everyone else gets the scraps. Seriously go back and watch the later seasons, the quality of dialogue and depth of conversation are head and shoulders over everyone else. The rest of it isn't bad, it's just odd how displaced they can feel at times.


But honestly I'm not complaining because Isaac is a treat every time he's on screen."
Castlevania,Good. The Richter era was always the smart and logical continuation.
Castlevania,"I don't really get how this show has such a diehard fanbase. I quite liked Season 1, thought it had a lot of promise, but it was like 4 half hour episodes. It was barely even a movie. Then Season 2 had some cool parts, but was hampered by super basic ""intrigue"" that took up most of the story while the main characters hung out in a basement until the last episode and then it just flung itself into a premature and unearned conclusion.

I got a couple episodes into Season 3, but the dialogue was just getting worse and worse and the story was still all over the place. I gave it up and haven't looked back. Felt like a huge waste of potential."
Castlevania,"Amazing news, Castlevania isn't perfect but it's the best video-game adaptation I've ever seen. I'm very excited for this and glad they went to Richter."
Castlevania,"AAAAWWWWWW SHIT!!! YEAH BOYEE!!!

Lost my shit a little there..."
Castlevania,"Aww, fuck yeah! Let's go."
Castlevania,YES PLEASE.
Castlevania,"I hate to say it: but Warren Ellis' pen made the original Netflix series what it was and what it is. 

Without him, I'm skeptical that this will even be half as good."
Castlevania,FUCK YES! Castlevania was such an amazing show.
Castlevania,Castlevania is easily one of my favourite animated series from recent years. You already know the team at Powerhouse is going to pop the fuck off with the animation on this.
Castlevania,"I enjoyed the Castlevania animated series, but I do hope that this new one: a) is properly planned and features tighter pacing; b) Has less immature dialogue with obnoxious swearing; c) features more of the games' soundtrack.

Hyped to see Rondo and Symphony adapted!"
Castlevania,I hope they’re done with Religion is Evil and Dracula  is an “anti-hero in love who is right about humanity” bullshit. It was old before it started.
Castlevania,YES!!!!!!!!
Castlevania,I think this is the only belmont who has killed a 100% powered dracula
Castlevania,"I hope it actually has, you know, Dracula this time"
Castlevania,"I'm so fuckin' hype. Castlevania the animation has been some of my favorite binge watching experiences ever.

Edit: People don't like when you're hype 😭"
Castlevania,Kinda lost interest in this show after the whole incest rape scene
Castlevania,Awesome.  Was not expecting anything on this so soon.
Castlevania,"hmm, not involving the guy from the original 'cos he got caught creeping tho.."
Castlevania,"Castlevania was right up there with Arcane as far as videogame adaptations, as well as animated shows in general (although it's not without its issues, more so than Arcane so far).  Can't wait to see what they do with this one."
Castlevania,"Hopefully they won't fire their talent in the middle of the series, like last time."
Castlevania,So it's a different team right?
Castlevania,Shit I've been meaning to watch this for a while and just haven't
Castlevania,"I hope they will get to Leon and Simon sooner or later. I know Simon is way before Richter and it wouldn't make much sense to go back to him, but I have good hopes for Leon since he's the founder of the house and the first in chronological order."
Castlevania,No lie Richter is beautiful
Castlevania,Awesome cant wait
Castlevania,Nice!
Castlevania,Based on how things ended in season 4 I'm really interested to see how things are going to turn out
Castlevania,"Are you dictating your fucking obituary to me, Belmont?"
Castlevania,I wonder what happened to belmont village
Castlevania,Does this mean we will get an adaptation of Symphony of the Night?  Please…
Castlevania,*Bloody tears intensifies*
Castlevania,"About two-three hundred years between Trevor to Richter.  While I think a Simon's Quest adaptation would be baller (all the trailer would need is someone muttering, ""What a terrible night to have a curse""), the Richter games have more ""actual plot"" than the NES games do, for obvious reasons."
Castlevania,"Trevor is around 1490's, Richter around 1780's. 

Castlevania gets really fuzzy and rarely specifies who is who's father, but between them you have the following:

Christopher Belmont (Adventure, Adventure Rebirth, Belmont's Revenge), Soliel Belmont (Christopher's son), Simon Belmont (I/Vampire Killer/Haunted Castle/IV/Chronicles, II, Smash), and Juste Belmont (Harmony of Dissonance). Of these, Simon is by far the most known, being the original and in Smash. 

Richter was probably chosen so they can keep Alucard, and they have other characters they can use like Maria and Shaft. As much as I'd like to see Simon, they'd have to create a whole cast outside of him and bringing back Dracula/Death."
Castlevania,"If you’re interested, there are videos on YouTube that breakdown the castlevania timeline and lore. They’re really fun to watch even if you don’t play the games"
Castlevania,"IIRC the Castlevania lore is insane, second only to Kingdom Hearts in its absurdity. It’s best to not worry about it generally."
Castlevania,isaac’s arc was damn impressive
Castlevania,Issac is the most interesting character they’ve had.
Castlevania,Too bad about the Trevor/Sypha/Alucard story for season 4
Castlevania,"I’m not trying to be rude, but Castlevania’s animation is not that good. There are a ton of shows with better animation. 

If you want to see something *gorgeous* watch Karas."
Castlevania,"Death and Dracula come back for most of the games, so it's possible they make a return or play into the story somehow."
Castlevania,Shaft basically one-upmanshipped death in the two games that featured Richter. You usually fight death right before dracula but this time you fought death before fighting Shaft which was a nice twist. So i'm guessing the big bad will be shaft this time around since he is the only one i can think of that is able to take that mantle. A pretty unique character compared to most of the past bad guys (yes i'm aware of his name lol).
Castlevania,Well it's not like that stopped shows like Supernatural.
Castlevania,That's a concern I have as well because the original series was really well written. Here's hoping it has the same care and quality to it as all 4 seasons of Castlevania had
Castlevania,"Probably less swearing like a teenager, which is nice. On the other hand, absolutely nobody can write self destructive characters like Warren Ellis."
Castlevania,"Yeah, the original series was SUCH a Warren Ellis story, I’m not sure how this will end up. Willing to give it a fair chance, though."
Castlevania,Whos Warren Ellis and what happened to him?
Castlevania,[deleted]
Castlevania,"""obvious reasons"" = hearsay and aspersions. 2022 🤡🌎"
Castlevania,Maybe it has a chance of being actually well written!
Castlevania,"Didn't you feel it in season 4? To me it was like night and day, I wasn't even aware he had been removed. I was like 'wtf is happening?' and literally on a hunch googled 'Watren Ellis canceled' 😆 Confusion alleviated. 

This will most likely be bland and generic with some slick animation. Which...is fine."
Castlevania,"Hopefully, it's for the better. His writing was garbage. S3&4 were badly written, plotted, and structured."
Castlevania,Since it appears to be adapting Rondo/Symphony it would make sense.  Alucard is the protagonist of Symphony after all.
Castlevania,I wasn't expecting another Castlevania series at all honesty because I think the team that made it moved on to Devil May Cry or something.
Castlevania,Definitely sounds like Alucard's voice is in the trailer.
Castlevania,Isn't it Rondo of Blood?
Castlevania,">  and Blood of Rondo Castlevania games.

Welp... Somebody fucked up."
Castlevania,"He was so scared up and damaged he likely could not really fight anymore, or as well at least, that he retired to raise a family."
Castlevania,"Maybe he could return as shaft, who knows how would he react to knowing dracula was resurected."
Castlevania,"His philosophical character stuff was *such* a contrast to the rest of the show. The forgemaster stuff in general was very interesting because they were humans working for Dracula but Hector and Isaac were very different, to put it lightly, lol. 

You've got vampire storylines, which are... well, they're vampire storylines. 

Then you've got Trevor and Sypha, which frames it in a bit more of a normal human viewpoint. But with 2 supremely badass warriors."
Castlevania,Isaac doesn't even appear in the final episode.
Castlevania,I would argue the CV1 and CV2 stories that could come from Simon's time would have worked prior to the Richter storyline.
Castlevania,"We're not used to seeing dark and serious western animation like this. The animation level is very good. It's dark, serious, and adult, so a lot of fans really take to the edginess, kind of like with Zack Snyder DC Universe."
Castlevania,I think it could become even better.
Castlevania,Simon and Julius did as well
Castlevania,He doesn't belong in this world!
Castlevania,"If it’s based on Rondo and Symphony, then presumably a main villain would be [Shaft](https://castlevania.fandom.com/wiki/Shaft), a dark priest that resurrects Dracula in the games.

This means Dracula would likely reappear eventually.

My prediction is that the first season is Richter trying to stop Shaft from resurrecting Dracula (which will no doubt involve kidnapping women that Richter must save, as in the games), but ultimately failing, while the next season follows Richter trying to recover from his failure and kill Dracula, while also following a weakened Dracula attempting to regain his strength after being gone for a few centuries.

If I’m right I’ll give myself a cookie."
Castlevania,"Warren Ellis had finished his script for Season 4 by the time he was booted, and it was still used. Hope instead the new writer doesn't abuse his power."
Castlevania,I'd guess another reason they went with Richter is because >!Alucard!< plays a major part and can be used to tie back to the OG series.
Castlevania,Richter is in Smash too FYI.
