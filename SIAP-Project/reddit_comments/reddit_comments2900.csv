Black Butler,"Wow, now I really feel old."
Black Butler,Heh-heh... just wait 'til you get to the demonic possession and alien abductions
Black Butler,"Wait, Benson the butler like the show, Benson?"
Black Butler,"It's kinda funny when kids realize there was a world before they were born, and that we had all sorts of stuff that predates the stuff they think is all new and original.  

When Soap was originally on, it was so controversial that most of us who were kids at the time were not allowed to be in the room while our parents watched it. I was alive when it originally aired, but I wasn't allowed to watch it until it was in syndication in reruns (and that wasn't for very long).

Back when it was new, we had ONE television in the house with four channels. NBC, CBS, ABC, and PBS. That was it. That was everything. So when Soap came on, it was usually bedtime for the kiddos, or we were at least pushed out of the room and sent to get ready for bed (yes, back in those days, kids were expected to be in bed by 9 or 10 pm). 

Really, there were a ton of great shows in the 70s and 80s. There was a lot of crap, too, but that's even more true today. At least back then we didn't have **any** reality shows. The closest we came to reality shows back then was *Battle of the Network Stars*, and that was worth watching (for adolescent boys, anyway) just to see Lynda Carter and Loni Anderson in swimsuits. 

I'm glad you've discovered some good old television. 

I will point out, though, that on Bewitched there were plenty of gay actors (Both Darrins, Uncle Arthur, Endora was bisexual), although the only one whose sexuality was at all hinted at (VERY subtly) as a character was Uncle Arthur, and that's because there was no mistaking how flamingly homosexual Paul Lynde was. "
Black Butler,"I first watched this when it was in syndication on a very young Comedy Central.  I couldn't believe how hilarious Katherine Helmond and Robert Guillaume were.  

To this day when the phone rings at work or something I'll look really put out and look at my co-workers and say, ""You want me to get that?""  

They all just think I'm an asshole though.  

Sometimes you've gotta suffer for your passions."
Black Butler,I'm old. Used to watch it when it was on. Brilliant show.
Black Butler,"Next, try [Dark Shadows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_Shadows). The premise of the show was way ahead of its time. 

>Dark Shadows is an American gothic soap opera that originally aired weekdays on the ABC television network, from June 27, 1966, to April 2, 1971. The show depicted the lives and loves, trials and tribulations of the wealthy Collins family of Collinsport, Maine. 

>The series became hugely popular when vampire Barnabas Collins (Jonathan Frid) appeared a year into its run. Dark Shadows also featured ghosts, werewolves, zombies, man-made monsters, witches, warlocks, time travel, and a parallel universe. A small company of actors each played many roles; indeed, as actors came and went, some characters were played by more than one actor. 

>Dark Shadows was distinguished by its vividly melodramatic performances, atmospheric interiors, memorable storylines, numerous dramatic plot twists, adventurous music score, broad cosmos of characters and heroic adventures. The original network run of the show lasted for nearly five years to amass 1,225 episodes."
Black Butler,"I haven't seen it, but this sounds amazing. Where am I able to watch this masterpiece?"
Black Butler,I saw it in the 80s. Funny show. It had a young Billy Crystal. I would love to find the series on blue ray.
Black Butler,I watched that entire series as I was growing up.  It is absolutely amazing and was way ahead of its time.  
Black Butler,'Those were the days'- Archie Bunker 
Black Butler,"Watched soap as a kid too.  Billy Crystal made me realize my uncle was gay 

"
Black Butler,"Oh, that was pretty amazing when it was new. Billy Crystal... I forgot about that. I can remember the theme tune, the madman, Benson. Great great stuff for prime time US TV."
Black Butler,"Soap is awesome! Same situation, my mom convinced me to give it a shot and it's really easy to see the DNA of shows like Arrested Development. Also, Billy Crystal's breakout role and the first gay main character on tv. Just to warn you though, it goes very downhill in the final season-- I think the showrunners were replaced. I couldn't even finish the series.

Edit: Watch for a tiny cameo in season 3 by Kurtwood Smith (Red from That 70's show, on a 70's show!) You'll be able to tell it's him because he looks... exactly the same."
Black Butler,"You should also check out Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman and Fernwood 2 Night for more 70s weirdness."
Black Butler,"Yup, mom and dad would send me to bed when it came on."
Black Butler,"It was even more so when it first came out. Speaking of coming out, it was my introduction to Billy Crystal, and had one of the first openly gay recurring characters on TV.  "
Black Butler,WKRP in Cincinnati also holds up really well and is surprisingly relevant today.
Black Butler,Seeing people born in the 70s talk about being a kid is weird as hell. I'd never thought I'd be binge watching a show that's almost 3 times my age... But here I am.
Black Butler,"I never saw Soap, but I did see the spin-off Bensen.. don't remember it though"
Black Butler,"Absolutely love this show. Watched it when it originally aired, drinking cheap vodka in my dorm room and laughing my ass off. 

Went back to watch it in reruns and it was just as funny as I remembered! Also, had a major crush on the daughter, and the tennis pro was Robert Urich, who played Spenser for Hire. "
Black Butler,I used to watch reruns of Soap on Comedy Central as a kid. I still like it to this day.
Black Butler,"I remember watching Soap as a kid, although I probably missed a lot of the jokes.  The butler, Benson, spun off onto his own show which I think was more popular, but less edgy and controversial then Soap.  I remember watching Benson because it would be on right after the Muppet Show."
Black Butler,"Watched it when it first came out, utterly hilarious.  Gave Billy Crystal his big break."
Black Butler,I believe this was actually the first gay character on TV. They made such a big deal out of Will & Grace when it came out. This show is amazing and I might have to re-watch. I loved it when I was a kid.
Black Butler,"Wonderful show, but it'll jump the shark after only a couple of seasons.  Sometime around when Benson leaves."
Black Butler,"That show was awesome.

FYI: I think Soap had the first scene of two men kissing on tv."
Black Butler,"*Soap* was awesome. The spin-off, *Benson*, wasn't as madcap."
Black Butler,"From the makers of The Golden Girls.
There was also another soap opera satire show in the 70's called Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman created by Norman Lear."
Black Butler,Oh yeah I forgot Benson was a spin off character/show from that show.
Black Butler,The 70s had some pretty groundbreaking shows. All in the family was a sitcom that regularly dealt with heavy issues like race. It even had a bottle episode where the wife was held captive and almost raped during a home invasion. That was a sitcom!
Black Butler,One of my all time favorite shows. I watched it as a young kid and knew it was way before its time. Now it is rerun on Logo and still never gets old. 
Black Butler,I watched it when it was originally on. It is a great and funny show. Enjoy the rest of it.
Black Butler,"My parents wouldn't let me watch this in the 70s because it was too risque. Shows how much the world has changed, most parents today would be happy if this was the most extreme thing their kids were watching."
Black Butler,I remember watching Soap when I was a kid. Loved Robert Guillaume and Billy Crystal in it.
Black Butler,"U remember watching this as a kid, then again when it was on Comedy Central. Loved it. "
Black Butler,I have been trying to find a place to watch this online! :) I remember this show fondly from my childhood!
Black Butler,"Soap was one of the more semi-controversial shows but it wasn't the only one, just do a bit of searching for shows that were like Soap, but it did have a fairly big audience."
Black Butler,">Has anyone here ever seen it?

I watched it in the 80s... I didn't realize it was a decade old at the time.  Huh."
Black Butler,Benson is the shit.
Black Butler,"I remember watching soap as a kid, and another show called Hotel Baltimore that was similarly over the top. I don't know if the show is available to view anywhere."
Black Butler,">even insulting her by saying that she had never been naked a day in her life... Holy shit at this one...

What am I missing here?"
Black Butler,Where were you able to watch this? 
Black Butler,Jennifer Salt who played Eunice and was extremely hot at the time is now the producer of American Horror Story
Black Butler,"Great show. The dude who played Doc Cottle on ""Battlestar Galactica"" plays a character named Dutch. I believe he was sleeping with Corrine if I'm not mistaken. It's been a while since I saw it. 

LOTS of great actors. There's a young Billy Crystal, Katherine Helmond, Richard Mulligan, Robert Guillaume, etc. etc. Fun show. Pretty wild. 

You might also want to look up ""Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman"" and ""Fernwood 2 Night."" You just might enjoy them if you enjoy ""Soap."""
Black Butler,">controversial

It's not controversial at all. Most people never heard of it. Controversial means that there is public dispute. Where is it?"
Black Butler,"Right??!?! Sheesh, I watched this as a kid and loved it.  "
Black Butler,"Word, I watched Soap *in reruns* with my mum 30 years ago. "
Black Butler,Don't forget the Cuban Revolutionaries.
Black Butler,"I believe it's pronounced ""alliance"""
Black Butler,...Huh!?
Black Butler,"He started out on *Soap*, then became so popular he got his own spin-off"
Black Butler,Benson was the spin off of Soap.  
Black Butler,">The closest we came to reality shows back then was Battle of the Network Stars

We also had Chuck Barris who gave us *The Dating Game*, *The Newlywed Game*, and of course, *Gene Gene the Dancing Machine* (*The Gong Show*)."
Black Butler,"> and that we had all sorts of stuff that predates the stuff they think is all new and original. 

Somebody informed me that the Old Spice commercials of today are just redone ""High Karate"" commercials from the 70s."
Black Butler,"> It's kinda funny when kids realize there was a world before they were born, and that we had all sorts of stuff that predates the stuff they think is all new and original. 

That's how I felt when I learned about the meta jokes in Green Acres. I remembered an opening where Gabor kept hearing the credits and sent her husband to check if it was a burglar but I figured that was too weird for a rural comedy and I probably misunderstood it."
Black Butler,"Add to your lone TV whatever UHF channels you could get, with varying levels of reception.

Also, *Soap* at the time was so controversial, some affiliate stations would refuse to show certain episodes.  That's back when your local TV station still had some autonomy."
Black Butler,bed time is definitely not something that only existed in the 70s and 80s.
Black Butler,Did you walk uphill to school both ways? 
Black Butler,Just don't watch the Johnny Depp remake movie. 
Black Butler,"Part of the fun of Dark Shadows (if you can get in the right mindset for it) is watching TV technology change. The early episodes have long scenes that last from one commercial break to the next. Then they get the technology to switch scenes easily and there's one episode where a character walks into a room, asks a question and immediately walks out -- as if a producer wanted to test that they could do a 30 second scene."
Black Butler,"Unfortunately that was a daily program, so there are more than 1,200 episodes. You could spend four hours a day watching it and it'd still take you six months."
Black Butler,It's on [IFC](http://www.locatetv.com/tv/soap) on Saturday mornings. They advertise it during Portlandia a lot.
Black Butler,"I got it this week at Wal-Mart, $20 for the series."
Black Butler,Youtube does have them... but you have to deal with darkened corners so... I don't think they are allowed to do that. (So I can't support it!.) But it might be on Netflix. I don't know but I THINK it is. It totally is available on DVD however. A used DVD place will probably have it.
Black Butler,"Since television was broadcast in 480, I'm not sure it would make a difference unless the whole series was remastered and I doubt anyone still has the original recordings."
Black Butler,"""Oh, you wear that belted?"""
Black Butler,"Well, you knew who you were then."
Black Butler,As God is my witness I thought turkey's could fly 
Black Butler,"""Mickey Mouse's dog was gay?!?""

Not only was Billy Crystal's character (Jodie) one of (if not the) first gay character, but that was almost never the joke.  Characters sometimes made fun of him for being gay, but more often than not, the laughs came at the expense of the character making the joke than at Jodie.  Much like Archie Bunker, the joke was on the intolerant or ignorant, not the other way around.


The fact the character was gay would have been groundbreaking, but the fact the show treated him with such respect was just decades ahead of its time."
Black Butler,So good I bought the DVD of the whole series.
Black Butler,"> Hotel Baltimore

I think that had a short run but was outrageous"
Black Butler,Your born naked.
Black Butler,Wow..! Your parents LET you watch it? Most people I know weren't allowed anywhere near the room when *Soap* was on. You had some pretty liberal (or absent) parents. 
Black Butler,"I watched as a kid, but hated it.  So it goes..."
Black Butler,"Oh, *yooooou'll seeeee...*"
Black Butler,Confused? You won't be after this week's episode of...SOAP!
Black Butler,"The show gets a little crazy. 

Next time you think any way of thinking or type of show or what have you is new, remember learning about Soap. 

And go check out Google to learn about the far more benign spin-off starring Benson. "
Black Butler,I remember watching Benson but not Soap
Black Butler,"Weren't they all game shows, rather than reality shows?"
Black Butler,"Early 70s, the original Reality Show; An American Family-The Louds which aired on PBS"
Black Butler,"But *The Dating Game* was all paid variety acts, not actual amateurs (same as *America's Got Talent*).  *The Newlywed Game* was a game show, and yeah we had a LOT of those. Some of them got pretty raunchy, too. Match Game was risque as hell sometimes. "
Black Butler,"Hai Karate, actually. I totally forgot that stuff existed. 

With good reason. It was rank. "
Black Butler,"Well, I lived on a hill, so I walked uphill about 1/4 mile to my bus stop and had to stand there in Michigan blizzards (which were pretty awful in the 1970s and early 1980s) waiting for my bus to get to me. 

I played on playground equipment that was made of rusty metal. I remember my parents having a car without seatbelts. We had both and archery and target shooting club in my high school and students were allowed to keep their club-related weapons in their car on campus... There were no metal detectors in our schools, either. 

We didn't have home video until I was nearly in my teens, and back then if you wanted to rent a video you had to go to the appliance store where you bought your VCR (Highland Appliance, Fretter Appliance, etc.)

When I was a kid, we still had cold war drills in elementary school-- We would be required to hide under our desks and pretend that the Russians were nuking us. As if hiding under our desks would help...

I'm old enough to remember being taught Metric, and not the Imperial system of measurement, because they were certain the nation would be dropping the Imperial system soon. Of course, it never happened and I still struggle with Imperial measurements-- which really don't make a lot of sense once you understand Metric--- to this day. 

I remember when there was no such thing as portable music. No cassettes. No CDs. No MP3s. If you wanted to listen to music, you either got a radio and tuned in, or you went home and listened to records. 8-tracks were a thing, and there were portable 8-track players, but they lasted about 15 minutes on 6 D-cell batteries, and they were large, heavy, and sounded like crap. 

We all wore onions on our belts, too. "
Black Butler,Thanks a ton for the heads up.  I didn't have cable access during it's initial run and I've always wanted to check it out.
Black Butler,Girls were girls and men were men.
Black Butler,"Exactly, he was usually smarter and more level headed than anyone. Just a fantastic show."
Black Butler,"Well yeah, but I'm failing to understand the huge insult. Big enough for OP to say.....Holy shit at this one."
Black Butler,"Hey, this was on in the 70's; the last great hurrah of the benign indifference school of parenting. When I was 13 me and mom would watch *Prisoner:Cell Block H* at 11:30pm while chainsmoking. Both of us."
Black Butler,"Yup, my parents expressly forbade viewing Soap. We had to wait for them to go out in order to watch it. I remember how soaked with sex the sitcom was but it was funny as hell."
Black Butler,"Also Benny Hill was my favoritist as a kid, I would beg my mom to let me stay up and watch it.  I would laugh hysterically when they were chasing the naked woman around the cemetery."
Black Butler,My dad worked swing and got home at 11:30 and he would make nachos and we would watch Bizarre.  
Black Butler,I used to watch this and Dream On with my father for sure.
Black Butler,Back then my parents didn't really care what we watched or did. I graduated high school in '77 and my parents were pretty much absent from the age 16 and on. 
Black Butler,Hahaha a hahaha hahaha hahaha
Black Butler,Benson was on for a LOT longer
Black Butler,"Terms like these are so wide-ranging and vague. I think of game shows being more about games, trivia, and such. Chuck Barris' shows were more about the quirky people on them, and I think they have more in common with the modern reality show rather than *The Price is Right* or *Hollywood Game Night*. *The Newlywed Game* was never about the best couple - it was a chance to expose all the weirdness and hopefully get some good-for-TV arguments and strife."
Black Butler,"> As if hiding under our desks would help...

It does, depending on how far away the nuke goes off.

You could be in blasting range and therefore your windows will shatter and glass will fly everywhere or panels will fall from the ceiling.  Hiding under your table makes it more likely for you to be recovered from the rubble if it collapses.

Ultimately, it's a bomb blast like any other and measures to protect from any bomb will also work on nukes."
Black Butler,"Boy, we could use a man like Herbert Hoover again."
Black Butler,"And when mom ran out of cigarettes, you would just run down to the store and buy some more for her.  At 13, no problem.  Different times, yes."
The Bridge,"A Big-Budget Fantasy Epic™ based on Astrid Lindgren's book?

The Bridge,"You are doing Hulu and MGM+ dirty. You think all those high profile limited series with top Hollywood talent on Hulu (such as The Dropout, Dopesick, Pam & Tommy, Fleishman is in Trouble, and Under the Banner of Heaven) are cheap? Absolutely not. Same goes for the Spider-Man spin-off shows in the works for MGM+. 

These shows might not be $20 million per episode big budget like the Marvel shows, Stranger Things, The Yellowstone spin-offs, Rings of Power, The Morning Show, Masters of the Air, Citadel, or The Last of Us and House of the Dragon but they are absolutely big budget shows."

The Bridge,"I saw sci-fi and Endymion and thought, ""Aren't they jumping the gun by not adapting the Hyperion Cantos first?""."
The Bridge,"> Acclaimed artist Simon Stålenhag’s latest work Endymion, is being developed for the small screen. The Bridge creator Måns Mårlind is teaming with Infinite Entertainment, the production arm of visual effects and animation company Goodbye Kansas, and Stålenhag to develop Endymion as a television series. Infinite will be taking the project out to buyers.


> Set in an alternative world at the dawn of the millennia, Endymion tells the story of a teenage girl who is searching for answers about her father’s mysterious death. She must team up with the other children of the Welsh blue-collar workers, who died while working with the new moon Endymion, to uncover the conspiracy of the international space program and redeem their parents, while accidentally discovering proof of extra-terrestrial life...

> Stålenhag is the internationally acclaimed author and artist behind books The Electric State, which is being developed into a feature film by the Russo brothers, and Tales from the Loop, which was developed into a television series by Nathaniel Halpern for Prime Video. His highly imaginative images and stories depicting illusive sci-fi phenomena in mundane, hyper-realistic European and American landscapes have made Stålenhag one of the most sought-after visual storytellers in the world"
The Bridge,Hope he casts Saga Noren lanskrim Malmö
The Bridge,Happy to see Stalenhag’s work is getting more mainstream interest.
The Bridge,"Dang, I thought ""dawn of the millennium"" is around 1000AD when I read this off hand. I need to recalibrate my mind's calendar."

Who knows, maybe a major studio/streaming service  get interested in making 'Hyperion' as well."
The Bridge,[deleted]
The Bridge,"It’s a show that has no made up drama. Everyone on the show is an expert in their field and everyone else knows and acts accordingly. There’s no hyped up drama that you see in other shows where there’s a conflict that can be resolved by a civil conversation, and when something strange or unusual happens the person reporting it is treated as credible (run some scans to see what’s up.). So many other shows do the opposite of this to build up drama. The worst conflict might have been when Shelby was promoted to first officer over Data and Worf but both of them accepted it and kept doing their job to the best of their ability."
The Bridge,"Picard's effortless, genteel *bon mots* and sage observations."

The Bridge,"I think that TNG really is the perfect embodiment of ""I want to live in this future"".

People are taken seriously, even if something outrageous happens to them. Everyone is taken for their merit, skin colour, sex, disability, etc. don't really enter into it. People are professional, driven, and still critical with themselves and each other. They want to hold each other up instead of kicking down.

It's peak comfy"

The Bridge,"Mike, is this you?"
The Bridge,"My wife and me are currently rewatching for the first time in one or two decades. Some episodes are really dates. Especially the early episodes and Riker's love-interests. Other episodes really have stood the test of time. Overall, we are loving it, currently watching 2-3 episodes a day."
The Bridge,It's the ever present hum of the spaceship. It's always there in the background. Realized this a few years ago. Deep space 9 has no hum because it's not going anywhere.
The Bridge,I'm more of a TOS gal but something TNG really does do better over any other entry in the franchise is ship atmosphere and immersiveness. It's a wonder anybody gets any work done given how cozy your surroundings are.
The Bridge,"If we're having a love feast of Star Trek: The Next Generation, let's let everyone know that if you come across an episode named ""Code of Honor,"" you can go ahead and skip right past that bad boy.

Edit: Apparently ""Angel One"" is as sexist as ""Code of Honor"" is racist, but I don't remember that one. Also, I remember the Space Drugs episode being cringey although not a terrible episode. Roddenberry had *peaked*, man."
The Bridge,"I had been watching TNG for a while, and then had a weird feeling something was wrong. It took about a whole episode to realize that my subwoofer died and I couldn’t hear the background hum of the ship anymore."
The Bridge,"Also, the *action* is almost relaxing.

Every situation they encounter goes through a sensible and logical build-up; trying to understand the situation to better deal with it; with escalation only when the previous strategy didn't work; and every crew member has the opportunity to voice their opinions *and actually be listened to*.

You really do believe that they are on a *scientific* mission and want to minimize conflict rather than antagonize and blow up every species that looks at them funny."
The Bridge,I know what you mean. I love how quiet the show is. Sound effects and music are only when necessary. I feel like too many shows blare music throughout every episode
The Bridge,"TNG does improve on the TOS concept with more pleasant production values (and there aren't as many dated stories, and the expanded cast offers more variety than 'Kirk, Spock and some of the other regulars')"

I'm not sure it makes any sense... a mix of chairs and standing workspaces, which is clearly by position, not by personal choice, and seemingly random what jobs you stand for and which ones get chairs.

The Bridge,"[An awkward hybrid of cutting-egde space battleship and Marriott convention center](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6Zc8Co2H3w)

Loved it for many years in its day.  I rewatched some of this and man, is it ever pretentious.  Like, they rarely have a job.  Is it like a PR mission here??  The entire ship and thousands of people aboard are just driving around waiting for a distress signal or anomaly.  Starfleet is so morally and technically right- it sounded great in the day, now it strikes me more as arrogant.  Like you have these people warring for centuries and you invite them over for tea in a unique, kinda dumb way and they make peace because you're on SUCH a higher perfect level of evolution.  

Starfleet doesn't compromise its morals, or its costs.  It's like everything they offer is perfect because it's like a livesaving game-changer that they already had in-house and just had to give them a copy of, at no real cost.  It's trivial, look, the cure to your plague... blip, beep, synthesized, pass me a hypospray.  Never does Starfleet have to ask for things in return and  get into a dispute over who gave what, and who was robbed blind.

Love the characters... the writing, it's aged.  Well, I've aged.

I still wanna join Starfleet though.  In a minute"

The Bridge,For real. I watch TNG and DS9 to relax nowadays
The Bridge,Whoever thought of using stained hardwood as part of the bridge design was an absolute genius.
The Bridge,It's lit in the way that you might expect a futuristic workplace to be lit... even and soft...  as opposed to e.g. Star Trek Discovery which is more like nightmare submarine.  The least realistic lighting of all time had to be CSI Las Vegas: with people working in labs under lighting conditions that were more like a haunted house.

The Bridge,"Hell yeah!
New age sci fi is all cold metal and pointy edges.

Fine for workmanlike ships from the Expanse, but not galaxy class cruisers you have to spend years on."
The Bridge,"I know its been said to death at this point,but the orville went the same route with the neutral colours and aesthetic. It worked for me at least.

That and the fact that every second episode wasnt about how to save the universe,discussed in shouty crying whisper speak."
The Bridge,"It's also realistic since people want to be in comfortable environments. The harsh bright lights, angular and reflective surfaces, and cold sterility of modern sci-fi ships would create an absolutely horrible environment for daily life. 

TNG understood that they were creating an environment where people would feel at home. They showed scenes of private and interpersonal leisure aboard the Enterprise and made the ship feel like a place that people would want to spend time in."
The Bridge,One thing I’ve noticed after several watch through a though is Picard yells a lot.
The Bridge,"There is actually an episode that sort of subverts the lack of drama too. 

The Drumhead. 

Where a good amount of the crew get's caught up in what is essentially made up drama. [and picard](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADEDLoLY3AY) delivers probably a top 10 TNG moment."
The Bridge,It's unbelievable to me that this gets it lobbed with accusations of being boring. People are just so used to being obviously emotionally manipulated and bogged down in meaningless squabbles. So many minor issues are bypassed to get to the heart of ones that are actually relevant to that episode's theme/topic.
The Bridge,There was also [that time Data and Worf had issues](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMKtKNZw4Bo) as acting captain and first officer respectively. And then resolved it within two minutes.
The Bridge,"This is one of things I love about the show. Anytime I do a binge watch I swear I get more productive in my own like cause their professionalism is inspiring, even if it's fiction."
The Bridge,"Originally it was a hard and fast rule. Roddenberry thought we'd be past interpersonal conflict by then.

Then again they started slapping his hands around the time of the SPACE OIRISH episode.

Shit would have been fine in the 1970's, when schlock was king, but by 1988, people were less sanguine. 

TNG makes ""The Vulcan Hello"" look like parody."
The Bridge,"> The worst conflict might have been when Shelby was promoted to first officer over Data and Worf

To be fair, there was the entire Pulaski season, where they tried to channel McCoy and just ended up making her abrasive. Maybe it would have eventually led to a deeper character, but things sure seemed easier and less stressful once Bev came back."
The Bridge,"I guess it's that they do not have any ego issues in the crew, they all work with their skills to solve the problem, not their ego's.

Any drama is either added through some of the villain races and characters, the ""problem of the week"" or an occasional starfleet character pressuring them from HQ.

I had the same vibe with the West Wing. In its first 4 seasons despite the high stakes political themes, the cast was a tightly knit family, their egos only showed up in dealing with the outside world, or in their snappy banter. 

In the later seasons that changed after Sorkin left, characters suddenly started in-fighting and having ego issues just for the drama, and the show lost most of its warmth."
The Bridge,"Also the one where Troi wants to get her command certification feels like it has some conflict to me. Maybe i just find it incredibly relatable with the hard sciences vs the humanities thing. She’s very free form and based in her emotions, and command is so directly by the book that she struggles with it despite being a high ranking officer. I felt like Worf and Riker were being super hard on her and expecting her to not get it, although it was for good reason as they didn’t want anyone in command who couldn’t send a crew member to their death for the good of the ship. Riker was ready to give up on her for sure too. In the end she passes, but she hesitated."
The Bridge,"The worst conflict was in *Chain of Command* when Jellico was given command of the *Enterprise* and everybody started acting like babies, except for Data, who kept wondering what everyone's problem was.

But that was long after Gene died and they were letting some of his cardinal rules slide."
The Bridge,"I think that’s actually my problem with TNG. they’re too professional and uptight. The other Treks  had people be professionals, but still had character. TNG was nearly all work and ethical discussions and monologues. Even DS9, the darkest Trek, had far more friendly rapport between the characters. 

I don’t like the pristine, perfect law-abidingness of TNG."
The Bridge,"Sci fi needs way more classical Shakespearean acting in it, totally fits without missing a beat I’d say"
The Bridge,With occasional bouts of sass. Can't forget the Picard sass
The Bridge,"I regularly fell asleep to this show I’m high school in its syndication as it was on after the 9 pm news, started at 10. I love it for its merits but I think also because it was my comfy fall asleep show. I use it now for the same reason."
The Bridge,"same, just finished it in my sleep for like the 30th time. Its a go to for sure to sleep to."
The Bridge,My dad has a nap listening to Star Trek reruns every afternoon - he specifically likes that soothing audio.
The Bridge,"Maybe that's why The Expanse is hitting the mark. They are winging it, but each are great at their jobs. Early eps had pointless crew conflict that wasn't in the books at all, but that eases off.
Same with Babylon 5, all professionals, with some flaws.

New trek: all flaws, in a cartoon character way."
The Bridge,[https://archive.org/details/AmbientEngineNoiseidlingFor24Hrs\_614](https://archive.org/details/AmbientEngineNoiseidlingFor24Hrs_614)
The Bridge,"So speaking of the sounds of the bridge. I always like that ""hum"" white noise that is occurring at all times.

Because they are in a flying spacecraft, and I guess that is the sound of their propulsion system?

Now, if they go into warp, they are utilizing a warp drive, therefore shouldn't that create a different sound?

And also, if they are at a ""cruising"" speed, shouldn't that sound different than higher propulsion speeds? And do they change the background when that is happening?"
The Bridge,Too busy feuding with Shatner
The Bridge,"yeah, season 1 has aged pretty badly and all of the ""Riker wants to fuck an alien"" episodes suck. the others are great mostly"
The Bridge,"Riker was at his best in the classic Star Trek episode ""Federation Sexual Harrassment Training"""
The Bridge,"To me it's obvious that people get work done when they have a calm, clean, well-designed environment to do it."
The Bridge,"Fun fact: This was the 4th episode of the 1st season of ST:TNG. The same writer later basically recycled the exact same plot for an episode of Stargate SG1, which also ended up being the 4th episode of their first season.

https://stargate.fandom.com/wiki/Emancipation"
The Bridge,"Sub Rosa is a hard pass, too"
The Bridge,"Hehe that one was crap when it aired, and did NOT age well. 

But I gotta say- if you don't fail every once in awhile, you're just not taking enough risk.  But, at some point, didn't some guy pause and say ""... really??  I mean... really?"""
The Bridge,"Hah, I just watched that the other day.
It was a nice bit of retro 80's SciFi comment on the issues of the day, big hairstyles, and Riker boning planetary leaders.

Worth it for Tasha and Deanna's genuine laughter at Rikers state-enforced lingerie.
Edit: oops, mixed this one up with fellow one-starred ep: Angel One. Planet of the Women."
The Bridge,"Ha! I came here specifically to hear comments about this episode. I only saw it once around the time it came out, but I remember it as the episode that is both racist and has an absurd nod to multiculturalism."
The Bridge,"Or, turn the picture off and treat it as a radio play. That alone turns it from ""GAH!"" to ""meh""."
The Bridge,Is it? I remember that they all seemed to hate each other half the time.
The Bridge,"Best captain & best Trek series, hands down"
The Bridge,"> DS9 is equally cozy, imo.

Oh, you mean Btec B5?

*pulls pin, runs away*"
The Bridge,"This may me my bias as more of a Treky than a Star Warsy but I feel like what happened to Star Trek was worse.  For me, Star Wars was a fun action focused world and didn't tread as much on the philosophical.  The new Star Wars are still fun action, they just have worse storylines and dialogue.  Star Trek was so centered on right and wrong, difficult moral problems, and above all always showing that humans can rise above our baser instincts.  It was so optimistic.  Newer Trek is just action and pointless drama without the heart."
The Bridge,throw in doctor who as well.
The Bridge,"Testicle, obviously"
The Bridge,"> it sounded great in the day, now it strikes me more as arrogant

The Bridge,"It's glued laminated lumber.  [Glulam is the future](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glued_laminated_timber#:~:text=Glued%20laminated%20timber%2C%20also%20abbreviated,termed%20laminating%20stock%20or%20lamstock.)

It's vaguely googie retrofuturistic styling, but with craftsmanship"
The Bridge,"The change in lighting was one of the worst parts of Star Trek Generations for me.

It reminded me too much of the wartime Enterprise from ""Yesterday's Enterprise"" (in which the lighting worked well I think)."
Broadchurch,"I just watched the first season, which I thought was fantastic."
Broadchurch,It's a good show with solid performances undermined by a bunch of awful season finales.
Broadchurch,"Unpopular opinion: Even season 1 is seriously flawed because of the writing in its second half, but the actors, especially Tennant and Colman, do an amazing job making the show levitate. The direction, the editing, the location work -- it's all perfect. It all gels perfectly to cover up for the writing. The only flaw is the writing. Chris Chibnall can write beginnings, but he can't write endings. Or sometimes middles.

Nobody really talks about how season 1 starts treading water aimlessly around ep. 5 and 6 with ridiculous red herrings (a la the U.S. version of The Killing, another wildly overrated crime show with seriously problematic writing) and then ends with a lame shrug of a cliche: the cynical old “you can never really know anyone, even the people closest to you -- and anybody can turn out to be a killer!” cliche. That's a sign of a terrible crime/mystery writer. But when you have Tennant, Colman et al. doing amazing work with great production, that provides the biggest possible distraction to the rapidly expanding holes in the scripts.

Plus, Chibnall has said that if any spoilers had gotten out, he would’ve changed the ending and made someone else the killer! Like… excuse me, what?!? So... he cared more about foiling leaks and pulling a gotcha on the audience than about characterization? To me, that's a sign of a writer with no integrity. He's obsessed with the wrong things.

I could never make it through season 2."
Broadchurch,"Season 2 was pretty silly with all the courtroom stuff. I quite liked season 3, but there's this weird pornography subplot that makes no sense."
Broadchurch,"The show works because the actors are great. And the show is well made.

The story isn't very good, but season 3 has a better story than season 2.

Here's a weird fact: the show was remade as a US based show, with David Tennant, but without Olivia Colman who wasn't even asked...

Unsurprisingly the remake was a flop."
Broadchurch,S1 is incredibly rewatchable
Broadchurch,"No Lawyers and Courts in the UK don't work anything like that. The entire affair is basically hopelessly contrived, confusing and stretches credibility even by Hollywood standards.

And yeah it was remarked upon back when it was airing."
Broadchurch,Olivia Colman is brilliant in everything. I enjoyed this series too
Broadchurch,"Season 1 and 3 are amazing! Season 2 is good, but not on the same level as the other seasons."
Broadchurch,"My wife and I recently finished all three seasons and we loved it.  We both want another season, but I am not hopeful for that happening.  I really loved the scenery of this part of England.  After watching this show, I have been looking for a great place that will make scotched eggs, fish & chips, and a proper English Breakfast."
Broadchurch,"Don't know who you are basing the S2 reaction off of.  Was it as good as S1? No, but most series are not. All 3 were great, imo.  Now the U.S. version left a lot to be desired, though it still had Tennant."
Broadchurch,My wife and I finished all three seasons and we loved it - brilliant drama and twice as good as anything from the USA (that applies to most police series as well).
Broadchurch,The show was never good but s2 is easily the best simply for not being a stream of irrelevant red herrings thrown at you to mask the complete lack of story like 1 and 3.
Broadchurch,"I agree the second and third seasons aren't the best, but series 1 on its own is maybe my favorite crime/mystery show."
Broadchurch,"The first season is great, the second season is good, the third season is meh."
Broadchurch,"I would have paid dearly for Chris Chibnall to leave Doctor Who earlier and stop ruining that show so he could go back and make another season of Broadchurch, which I would never watch; I just want him busy with something else (I've never been able to make it beyond episode 1 of season 2). Most other Doctor Who fans would agree. He's leaving after this season, but that's not soon enough. His wretched, awful, terrible writing has completely tanked the world's longest-running sci-fi show.

As for Broadchurch S4 actually happening -- of course, wrangling Tennant and Colman together will be difficult, but if Chibnall can find a way, I'm sure he'll try, because otherwise nobody will want to work with him again for a while. He's destroyed his own career by making three appallingly bad Doctor Who seasons. Broadchurch S4 would be his only chance at redemption, unless some British network is run by complete idiots (though that's certainly possible)."
Broadchurch,"That's great, as long as he's not training them to take over Doctor Who at any point."
Broadchurch,This should be interesting since Chibnall has made it very clear he holds no secret key to replicating success.
Broadchurch,Broadchurch was one good season. His doctor Who had none.
Broadchurch,I hope the first lesson is “Don’t do any of the things I do on my shows”
Broadchurch,None of those people will write a good show.
Broadchurch,Not to mention the worst editing in a tv show I’ve ever seen.
Broadchurch,At least at ITV it’s not like he can make things worse.
Broadchurch,"""Broadchurch creator, and Doctor Who ruiner, Chris Chibnall""

Fixed it :P"
Broadchurch,"I think it's really cool that Chris has decided his focus since making the Biggest Thing on TV a decade back is pulling a more diverse pool of upcoming creatives into the industry.

  


  
But it is also quite funny that he's gonna be training people how to run a TV show lmaooo oh no"
Broadchurch,so shows that take away all mystery drama and suspense in the season finale. I know not every detective shows can be true detective first season level but Broadchurch had so much potential to just squander it so quickly.
Broadchurch,He gonna teach his shitty pro-capitalism politics to his students?
Broadchurch,This is good and more showrunners should do this. Many new show runners have been complaining they lack mentorship to help them avoid pitfalls
Broadchurch,He did broadchurch and torchwood
Broadchurch,"I wrote too long a reply to this in my first draft but 'nuf said already that we dont already know. 
The name Chibnall will forever be sour in my mind."
Broadchurch,"Going by ""that"" clip Chibnall is probbly one of thouse showrunners who want an IP to be something it is not like the wacos on Witcher, RoP and WoT and others that plague modern genre television, RTD and Moffat did embraced the camp as opposed to Chinballs. I hope he won't contniue that cringe mindset for another generation. That mindset should have been died after Sam Raimi's Spider-Man being supet succesfull but then the humorless Nolan isn't a Batman fan. (The Batman is better then TDK anyway, humor is part of that as well Reeves being a fan that understand)

He better kept to Third Doctor stories."
Broadchurch,"Yeah… but didn’t it feel like they just picked the murderer by asking who the audience least expected?

Reminded me of when they picked the cylons in BSG basically out of a hat."
Broadchurch,"You didn't enjoy Season 2 or 3 of Broadchurch? I'll admit that season 3 wasn't as good as the first season, but I fully enjoyed the shows entire run."
Broadchurch,[removed]
Broadchurch,Was Broadchurch not good?
Broadchurch,"Honestly, he seemed to embrace the camp most out of all the showrunners and was making Doctor Who the way it used to be. Look at his first series, it would fit right in the classic series. You have 3 companions, who all the writers have no idea what to do with, an issue which happened in Peter Davisons era. 

Also have companions that are barely fleshed out in anyway which is what happened to a lot of companions in the classic series. A Doctor who is a bit vanilla and doesn't have much of a story arc. Then you have the fact that there's no story arc across the series and every episode is standalone and no pre-title sequences as well.

Russell T Davies, was the one that made Doctor Who to be what it was not like, and he was all the best for it."
Broadchurch,"> as well Reeves being a fan that understand

Fun fact: When asked what his favorite iteration of Batman is, Reeves said Adam West. Man immediately gained my respect from that. Also, I distinctly remember there being a passing reference in the movie to a past ""Mayor West,"" which is even better because it's a twofer reference. I just really love the Batman."
Broadchurch,What clip?
Broadchurch,"I didn’t know Doctor Who was based on material from a medium completely different from  TV. 

Because that’s the biggest problem with the shows you listed. 

Stop slapping words together and comparing completely different things."
Broadchurch,"Idk, if anything Chibnall really leaned way too hard into fan service and nostalgia. His last episode was just pulling up old companions and doctors and going “remember them, fellow 50 something anoraks?” He was a giant Old Who fan and it showed, especially when he began adapting stuff from the Cartmel masterplan. Chibnall is probably the best case against “hire fans” ever."
Broadchurch,"Yes, if you rewatch it the plot makes no sense. It was carried by the excellent performances, the wacky plot twists, and the narrative tension.

For the record, I think that the murderer ultimately could have been a really interesting choice if it hadn't felt like a total asspull.

(For transparency, I really liked S1 when I first saw it in high school. Then I lost track of the show til after S3 aired, caught up, and was like... that was it?! So I went back to S1 and it all made sense.)"
Broadchurch,The Final Five was such a debacle and clearly something grafted into the plot after the event when clearly the original plan (such that it was) was that there were going to be Cylons numbered 1 to 12 and each having multiple copies (hence the backtracking to explain what happened to 7 since the original number allocations were clearly random).
Broadchurch,Compared to the 1st season they really paled in comparison and I say this as someone that binge watched all the seasons fairly closely together.
Broadchurch,"I did too. Even though the writing may have declined, the acting was worth watching every second of the series."
Broadchurch,They lost me completely with the trial.
Broadchurch,The first season of Broadchurch is A+ TV.
Broadchurch,"To be fair, I do think the show handled three companions well in Classic Season 2 with Ian, Barbara, and Vicki."
Broadchurch,"I watch Classic Who and could tell you a lot more about most of their personalities than I could about any of Chibnall's. I suppose Ryan would be Chibnall's most fleshed-out companion and he's only on par with someone like Peri, where they suddenly gave her an interest in botany out of the blue.

Chibnall's other companions are awful. Dodo is one of the most disliked Classic Who companions because there's not much to her and I read a comment a while ago that said, ""Yaz makes Dodo look like Sarah Jane"". I thought it was accurate."
Broadchurch,"Very illuminating, and even more reason not to go back and watch classic Who lol."
Broadchurch,"The Batman's cowl has a similar head shape to the 60s Batman, even down to the line running from both eyes and forehead."
Broadchurch,"I think they're referencing a clip from the 1980's when Chris Chibnall was 16 and said that a Colin Baker episode was bad. Because it was okay for everyone else to dislike it, but not okay for Chris"
Broadchurch,"> if anything Chibnall really leaned way too hard into fan service and nostalgia.

I feel if you watch his first season, that’s not true. If anything, the first season had barely any old villains, and felt like him trying to do an entirely fresh and new take on Who (I hope I’m remembering correctly there, it’s been a while).

I feel as if the reaction to that first series was so “meh,” that he and the BBC overcompensated, and THEN went down the fan service and nostalgia route hard, bringing back the Master, Daleks, Cybermen and so on. That when the ratings slipped, they panicked and started throwing shiney toys in front of the audience to lure them back.

But I feel the first season was rather more tepid, and probably more what he himself wanted to write; his own start on Who without a heavy reliance on older villains. He unfortunately just made the Doctor too passive in most episodes as a result, as if she was a witness to important events, rather than a key part."
Broadchurch,"It's A+ the first time, and the experience of watching it is incredible. Then you rewatch it and realize how little sense it makes. It's carried by the performances and the narrative tension/plot twists but there's really not much there there."
Broadchurch,Agreed.
Broadchurch,Season 3 was a travesty
Broadchurch,I never got the hype. It had some good performances but was a fairly bland affair.
Broadchurch,"Nah Dodo was worse, her introduction was tacked on the end of an episode and mostly skipped over, had an off-screen exit, only lasted a few episodes and they couldn't even keep her accent consistent across each episode. 

Chibnalls companions are up there with a bunch of other companions who mostly just stand around and not do much."
Broadchurch,">I feel as if the reaction to that first series was so “meh,” that he and the BBC overcompensated, and THEN went down the fan service and nostalgia route hard, bringing back the Master, Daleks, Cybermen and so on. That when the ratings slipped, they panicked and started throwing shiney toys in front of the audience to lure them back.

I feel like this was probably planned from the get-go, similar to how Russell T Davies did his era, where he gradually brought old lore and things into the series, except Chris Chibnall did it a bit  quicker.

Because the Dalek episode was already written and filmed before Series 11 begun airing, and the return of the Master was well into production during the airing of Series 11."
Broadchurch,Yeah wtf was that. Season 1 was incredible.
Broadchurch,"Granted, Dodo isn’t even Season 3’s worst companion. That would go to Katarina. At least Dodo made some sense on paper. Katarina was such a failure they wrote her out within 5 episodes."
Broadchurch,"Dodo wasn't the best and the behind-the-scenes issues you mentioned are definitely frustrating. That being said, at least Dodo had a personality and *did things*. She was like a cheery version of Susan and at least she'll always have *The Gunfighters*, where she stood up to Doc Holliday.

Yaz did practically nothing in every episode except a couple. I couldn't tell you anything about her. We kept being told how great she was but it was never shown (a major problem with Chibnall's era; tell, don't show). She was a cop and got to show her police skills *maybe* four times and for a few of those, she wasn't doing anything that I wouldn't expect from any other companion. Her crush on the Doctor was so tacked-on and felt like an attempt to make up for not giving her anything to do for the previous three series. She went from being just another companion to having these longing stares in the Doctor's direction, with close-ups on her face.

I like Mandip Gill (she responded to me in an AMA once, so she's aces in my book) but Yaz was only there for the Doctor to bounce exposition off."
Broadchurch,"Really? That’s interesting, didn’t know that. Honestly, I don’t follow much production stuff of the show, so for me, it was a situation of “series one: no lore, series two: ALL THE LORE!” 😂 I did love the Master stuff though cause I had no clue it was coming."
Broadchurch,"Like Victorian Clara, there was some potential to have someone who wasn't from our modern era (and especially so with someone from the Trojan War) but she got President Roslin'd instead in the very next story from her introduction."

Broadchurch,"[Line of Duty](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2303687/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0) \- This is a British tv show where in every season they deal with one case. It follows a team who police the police (so like the American Internal Affairs) and honestly every 1st episode of the season has grabbed me in a stranglehold to find out how the story will end. There's an overall story which stretches throughout the seasons as well. I liked this show way more than I had expected beforehand when I gave it a shot. Really top tier.

[Bosch](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3502248/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1) \- It has already been mentioned multiple times here. So here's a +1. I think the endings of some of the storylines don't really end as great as they start. But like *Line of Duty*, I believe you will want to find out where each season takes you.

[Beyond Evil](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt13634872/?ref_=rt_li_tt) \-  This is a Korean show. An upcoming police officer moves to a small town to try and catch a serial killer, he does this with the help of a police officer who has his own dark secrets..... This series shows flashbacks to really mess with what you think is happening. I thought it was pretty good. Very much a binge worthy show as you just want to keep watching to see wtf is going on.

I think you would probably like some of the older tv shows like [Millennium](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0115270/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0) (a show made by the creator of X-Files and deals more with kults and crazies) and [Cold Case](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0368479/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1) or [Without a Trace](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0321021/?ref_=tt_sims_tt_i_1) which both deal with missing persons or old murders they try to solve. These 3 shows are more procedural than the ones above, and the 'hot damn' quality isn't as high, but they definitely fall in what you're looking for."
Broadchurch,"This list changes a lot for me, but I love the Brits for this.

***Sherlock Holmes*** (1984-1994). Granada. John Hawkesworth *(Upstairs Downstairs, Duchess of Duke Street, Danger UXB)* as its showrunner. Starred Jeremy Brett as Holmes and David Burke and Edward Hardwicke as Watson. Best straight-up most faithful adaptations of ACD, even with the weird departures in the fina 90-minute episodes.  Down to the point of them recreating Paget illustrations off the page. Next best thing to reading the stories.

Other '80s literary BBC adaptation detective shows are a bit numerous to mention, but I'll add *Poirot, Lord Peter Wimsey* (though I prefer the '80s series (Edward Petherbridge) to the '70s series (Ian Carmichael)), *Brat Farrar, The Racing Game* (so good Dick Francis decided to write more Sid Halley novels), *Inspector Morse,* and *Rumpole of the Bailey.* More modern proponents of this type of mystery would include *Magpie Murders, \[C.B.\] Strike,* and *Case Histories.*  

[***River***](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrGdo8PDgzY) (2015). BBC. Abi Morgan *(The Hour, The Split)* written. Stars Stellan Skarsgard as a detective who sees ""manifests"" of the victims of the crimes he's investigating (it's not a fantasy/ghost thing, it's a mental health thing). 

***Happy Valley*** (2014-2023, 3 seasons). Sally Wainwright brings another funny, wry, tough Northern heroine to the screen in a really taut extraordinary detective series. Many of us who saw this first think of *Mare of Easttown* as a pale wannabe imitation.  I love all of Wainwright's writing, but this show is more concentrated than, say, *Scott & Bailey.* 

***Bron|Broen***  (2011, 4 seasons) (""The Bridge""). Hans Rosenfeldt.  A cross-border murder where the body is found placed exactly on the border in the middle of the bridge between Malmo and Copenhagen teams up a veteran detective (Kim Bodnia) with an Aspbergery quirk-filled detective (Sophia Helin).  It's been remade something like six times. *The Tunnel* (UK/France) and *The Bridge* (US/Mexico, an FX series) are both decent, but not nearly as good as the OG show, even though they only remake the first season and go their own way after that.

***The Missing/Baptiste*** (2 seasons each, 2014-2021) Harry and Jack Williams. Border-crossing/non-linear narrative detective thrillers that basically were a UK response to Scandinoir series like *Bron|Broen.* 

***The Shadow Line*** (2011). Hugo Blick, the auteur who writes/directs/produces all his series. And even after *The English,* I still think this one's his best.  A murder of a crime boss being investigated both by the cops and the criminals. Lil' bit surreal, a whole lot violent, and very surprising."

Broadchurch,Psych and Monk. Two lighthearted detective shows where the stakes aren't always super high. And the chemistry between all the actors in Psych is absolutely phenomenal.

The Big Bang Theory,Say what you want about Big Bang Theory in the later seasons the casting all around was pitch-perfect. The chemistry everyone had is one of the big reasons the early seasons work so well. The chemistry Johnny and Kaley had is what made the relationship seem authentic and not hard to believe at all. Also I'll always say the three leads taking pay cuts so that their other cast members could get bigger raises and a bigger piece of the pie is one of the most selfless things I've ever seen in Hollywood.
The Big Bang Theory,It’s always interesting to see romantic chemistry from a show translate to real life. I guess it’s a real testament to good casting

The Big Bang Theory,I swear that Johnny Galecki came out like 10 years before this show was made. I was really surprised to see them dating but maybe it was the Mandela effect.
The Big Bang Theory,I had no idea. Or maybe I used to know and forgot.

The Big Bang Theory,"KALEY CUOCO - THE FLIGHT ATTENDANT - ORIGINS? 
Was Kaley Cuoco's role as a flight attendant/CIA spy based on that of a real air hostess/CIA spy in the seventies? Her name was Vivienne Templeton and she features in Beyond Enkription in #TheBurlingtonFiles series of fact based spy novels. 

If you're a Kaley Cuoco fan and interested in flight attendants living double lives just like Kaley, best read Beyond Enkription, the only novel to be published to date in TheBurlingtonFiles factual espionage series by Bill Fairclough. Look out for Vivienne Templeton who in real life was not only what was then described as an air hostess in Haiti Air Inter but also a CIA operative in Haiti and the Caribbean. 

Vivienne was based in Fort Lauderdale working under the cover of being an air hostess who moonlighted by managing holiday lets in the Bahamas and Florida. The Burlington Files series is based on the gripping true story of a genuine spook, Bill Fairclough aka Edward Burlington whose MI6 codename in real life was JJ. Critics herald it to be just the stuff epic films are made of.

Coincidentally Kaley Cuoco who stars in the Flight Attendant actually looks a lot like the real life flight attendant/CIA asset Vivienne Templeton who featured in Bill Fairclough's spy novels in The Burlington Files series. See TheBurlingtonFiles + Everipedia websites for photos of Vivienne in the seventies. Beyond Enkription is a must read for espionage illuminati. 

See https://theburlingtonfiles.org/news_2021.09.26.php + https://everipedia.org/wiki/lang_en/vivienne-templeton-1.

Do look up the authors or books mentioned on Amazon, Google The Burlington Files or visit https://theburlingtonfiles.org and https://everipedia.org/wiki/lang_en/bill-fairclough and read Beyond Enkription."
The Big Bang Theory,"Jim Parsons is a top tier actor, glad he's been able to find good success outside of TBBT. Same for Kaley Cuoco with The Flight Attendant, always felt like Penny and Sheldon were the strongest parts of the show"
The Big Bang Theory,">Say what you want about Big Bang Theory 

I will, it was terrible. Goddamn especially if you were a minority and a physicist."
The Big Bang Theory,"Are we really at the point now where we're pretending that this show was funny at any point in time? It's not that it was bad in ""the later seasons,"" it was always completely devoid of comedy."
The Big Bang Theory,Keri Russell and Matthew Rhys is another pairing that translated to real life that I love
The Big Bang Theory,"Michael C. Hall and Jennifer Carpenter from dexter got married, and divorced throughout the run of the show. They played (adopted) brother and sister so kinda funny to think about, but even stranger was after their divorce their was a subplot where their characters had a weird attraction to each other."
The Big Bang Theory,Jesse plemons and Kirsten Dunst from Fargo!
The Big Bang Theory,Eliza Taylor and Bob Morely from The 100
The Big Bang Theory,"kutcher and kunis, though in the show, it wasn't as much of a relationship and she ends up with Fez"
The Big Bang Theory,"Maybe it was Sarah Gilbert's coming out that confuses you. She and Galecki had roles in ""Roseanne"" and actually dated in front of and behind the cameras for a while."
The Big Bang Theory,I believe that was Jim Parsons.
The Big Bang Theory,"He played a gay guy in the movie  ""The Opposite of Sex"". Maybe,  that's what you're thinking.  (Gawd, I LOVE that movie!)."
The Big Bang Theory,"these rumors appeared after his roles in which he played gay men. But in his life, Johnny constantly met only with women, after Kaley he had a 3-year relationship with Kelly Garner and there were other girls. He has a three-year-old child.  Johnny leads a secretive lifestyle, if Kaley hadn't told reporters about their affair, no one would have found out."
The Big Bang Theory,"I honestly thought the same, but I think this is a case where everyone was constantly insinuating Johnny was gay, and he never said anything to dispute it. Especially at the time, that kind of reaction to gay rumors was pretty much seen as confirmation."
The Big Bang Theory,[removed]
The Big Bang Theory,[removed]
The Big Bang Theory,She is also great as Harley Quinn :)
The Big Bang Theory,"Sheldon carried the show for me probably, but I'd say the same of Dwight on The Office to some degree too. Some people say the show died with Michael leaving, for me it would've died if Dwight left."
The Big Bang Theory,Parsons was soo good in The Boys in the Band.
The Big Bang Theory,"What success has Parsons had outside of it?  As far as I know, he's just doing VO for Young Sheldon, which is almost the same thing."
The Big Bang Theory,The Flight Attendant was great in Season 1 but became laughably bad in Season 2. They should have kept it to the first season as it would have been perfect then.
The Big Bang Theory,"And if you were really a physicist (or worked in academia at all), it was likely one of your favorite shows. No show before it has ever satirized the day-to-day of academia quite as well."
The Big Bang Theory,Plenty of Nobel laureates seem to like it well enough to do cameos
The Big Bang Theory,[removed]
The Big Bang Theory,Believe Ewan McGregor and Mary Elizabeth Winstead(the girlfriend actress) are together from Fargo season 3 as well. Only found this out because I was just recently watching it. Weird.
The Big Bang Theory,They are so great in that show! I was happy to see them together.
The Big Bang Theory,They killed him dirty
The Big Bang Theory,"No, I knew about Jim Parsons. It's probably me misremembering it, but I swear I looked him up a decade after Roseanne and saw that."
The Big Bang Theory,"It's strange that you thought that. Because Johnny was constantly dating women, after Kaley he had a 3-year relationship with Kelly Garner. After Kelly Garner, he had several other relationships, short and long. He just doesn't advertise his novels."
The Big Bang Theory,She's very good in HQ
The Big Bang Theory,It is hard to compare The Office to a show with a laugh track.
The Big Bang Theory,Dwight carried those last 2 seasons hard
The Big Bang Theory,He was in Hidden Figures
The Big Bang Theory,He got nominated for a golden globe and an emmy last year for Hollywood
The Big Bang Theory,"Agree, that second season didn't hit as well, which was unfortunate."
The Big Bang Theory,The uni deans were brilliant
The Big Bang Theory,"Yeah and it got people interested in science to even a slight degree.

The show gets a lot of crap but it absolutely, imo, helped pave the way for nerdom to become as acceptable as it is today."
The Big Bang Theory,"Because they're starved for attention

To be a Nobel laureate in physics  you typically have to be an old person and rewarded for research you did in your youth"
The Big Bang Theory,So instead of dating apps I should ask Noah Hawley to cast me in Fargo? Sounds good to me.
The Big Bang Theory,"Ewan and Mary was a weird one because he cheated on his wife with Winstead, but then they'd broken up pretty badly by the time they appeared together again in Birds Of Prey."
The Big Bang Theory,The issue with that was he was asked why hadn’t he defended himself after all the gossip that he was gay and he came out saying he wouldn’t need to defend because that’s nothing bad or something to be ashamed about so why would anyone come out to deny that like if he was being criticized.  Maybe that’s why
The Big Bang Theory,Ditto.
The Big Bang Theory,[deleted]
The Big Bang Theory,They're married with a kid now
The Big Bang Theory,"there was def a weird period of time where if gay marriage or gay rights was defended by someone in media, that person was seen as gay unless they immediately denied it and even then the rumors would persist. I remember the same with former football player Brandon Ayanbadejo. Used his platform to advocate for gay marriage and so many either hated him for it or thought he was gay cause how can a straight man defend gay marriage? very weird times"
The Big Bang Theory,Lol you're not seriously downplaying someone getting nominations in categories in the 2 biggest awards in the TV industry lmao
The Big Bang Theory,"Happened to me in real life.    I was very into the cause of gay marriage.     Many people assumed I was lesbian, didn't even matter that I had a husband and a child."
The Big Bang Theory,[deleted]
The Big Bang Theory,"At most 20 male actors get a Golden Globe television nomination each year out of every show released in the US. That's hardly ""lots of people getting nominated"""
The Big Bang Theory,"I don't hate big bang theory as much as many here do, but it's definitely modern family by a mile."
The Big Bang Theory,"Modern Family was the better show IMHO.

However I don't understand why reddit has such hate boner for BBT. It's a classic sitcom format couched in geek/nerd culture."
The Big Bang Theory,Modern family by a long shot
The Big Bang Theory,"
**Big Bang Theory cons:**

•	Scenes in later seasons are given no time to breathe or develop. Many scenes are created for a singular joke, but cut to the B plot before we can see the aftermath or reactions. Scenes in Big Bang Theory were just so short

•	Midway through its run, the show stops being about nerds doing nerdy things and almost completely begins to focus on relationship drama exclusively

&nbsp;

**Modern Family cons:**

•	Almost all the Mitch/Cam plotlines are built on dishonesty. They constantly don't want to tell each other something, which leads to farce.

•	All the kid actors aged out of their cute, quirky personalities. Manny was an ""old soul"" in a little kid's body. However, when he was high school/college age, the schtick was insufferable. For Luke, it stopped being ""dumb kid"" and became ""mentally disabled adult""

•	Haley and Alex's characters graduated High School, so the show struggled to find reasons to keep them in the house and with the family

&nbsp;

Overall, I would say that Modern Family's characters were more endearing and their comedic plotlines more consistent than Big Bang Theory."
The Big Bang Theory,"BBT seemed to say ""Let's tell a fake and myopic story"" but then sometimes gave me moments of sincerity that were a pleasant surprise.

Modern Family seemd to say ""We are a sincere and progressive show"" but then often felt fake and myopic.

I still prefer Modern Family, by a long shot, but I often felt underwhelemed - while with BBT, I expected nothing and then was pleasantly surprised from time to time. 

I think BBT will age well in the way ""Three's Company"" aged well: it is sexist trash, but many things about it worked surprisingly well or were better than they had to be."
The Big Bang Theory,"I prefer modern family as I love the office and parks and recs so the mockumentary stuff hooked me. 

Big bang is great but it felt I dunno too smart for its own good at times."
The Big Bang Theory,Loves them both.
The Big Bang Theory,"Big Bang Theory. Modern Family had a great start, but ran out of gas relatively fast for me. Big Bang had about five very funny years, got somewhat lost in the relationships for a few years, then surprisingly reinvented as a domestic comedy the last three years or so.  The way it was going, Big Bang probably could have run for another 10 years if they had wanted to keep going."
The Big Bang Theory,Big Bang Theory set this country back 25 years.
The Big Bang Theory,"Modern Family 100%

Big Bang Theory is cringe unfunny dweeb trash."
The Big Bang Theory,Curb Your Enthusiasm
The Big Bang Theory,"I find MF considerably better written and funnier, at least in the first three seasons"
The Big Bang Theory,"Only watched Modern Family on YouTube reruns and cannot believe I never saw it before.  It is leagues better than Big Bang, and I enjoyed that show as well."
The Big Bang Theory,"I've only ever watched encore performances of MF and I found the Dunphys funny but soon enough the other characters were too much to bear and I stopped watching. Julie Bowen was a rock star.

I watched TBBT religiously until the season when Howard went to space. After that I never looked back but the show is on 24/7 and if KC is on particularly if her scene partner is Jim Parsons I'll stop and watch."
The Big Bang Theory,"Everyone loves to hate the big bang. It was brilliant when it started, but like everything,  it petered out towards the end. Didn't mind modern family, although practically every character was a caricature? Personally,  I choose Malcolm in the middle?"
The Big Bang Theory,"I  came to BBT late and enjoyed it, but MF is really next level with how they weave together A/B/C plotlines that also follow a common theme."
The Big Bang Theory,"A lot of people (including me) can’t stand laugh tracks, especially in modern shows. Multicam comedies seem much more broad in their humor style"
The Big Bang Theory,Sounds like you were conditioned to hate BBT honestly.
The Big Bang Theory,"It wasn’t funny, so I stopped watching.   The show conditioned me."
The Big Bang Theory,"Nah, your response goes beyond a simple ""this isn't funny to me"". You seem to be hostile towards it."
The Big Bang Theory,"I understand the point being made here, but a laugh track and a live studio audience (like Big Bang Theory) are not the same thing. 

Live is organic laughter, while a laugh track is essentially a sound effect of “canned” laughter."
The Big Bang Theory,"I wouldn’t think so, the Frasier reboot will likely use one and the show will likely be good."
The Big Bang Theory,"The multi-camera sitcoms almost disappeared in America by the late 60s. The only popular ones left were Lucille Ball's later shows, and those were considered critical dinosaurs. In their place were single camera shows - including the Bill Cosby Show, My World and Welcome to It, Room 222, The Odd Couple - that were not so different from sitcoms we've seen recently. Many of them minimized laugh tracks, Cosby's show didn't use one at all.

Then Mary Tyler Moore launched a multi-camera/live audience show in 1970. All in the Family followed suit, Sanford and Son, and the Odd Couple changed over to an audience. By the time Happy Days launched as a single camera in 1974, it was already a dinosaur. It went to an audience after a couple of years.

The Big Bang Theory was the highest-rated American network sitcom its last nine years on the air. It's older cousin, Friends, remains a streaming hit 30 years after it debuted. There is no evidence that the style has played out - they've just stopped making them. Industries sometimes do stupid stuff.

What would it take to bring them back? A bankable star, probably with stage experience, who likes comedy and thinks he or she can feed off the energy of audience laughter and applause. And that's really all. After one breaks through, others will follow."
The Big Bang Theory,"DID that show actually have a laugh track? It was filmed in front of a live studio audience; weren't they the ones laughing? There are a bunch of behind-the-scenes looks at comedians warming up the crowd before the taping began, and the cast members being introduced to the audience wearing whatever outfit their characters would be in for that particular scene shooting first. Also, Star Trek ""Tribbles"" writer David Gerrold said on social media several times that he attended every taping of the show, because he was friends with one of the producers (it's how Gerrold, with DC Fontana, [was seen in the background talking to Stuart](https://i.imgur.com/E4KQM.jpg) in the episode where Wil Wheaton throws a party and Sheldon doesn't want anyone to go; Gerrold's producer friend asked him to be in it, instead of just in the studio audience)."
The Big Bang Theory,Streaming revives/reboots/reshashes tend to have them because the original shows did - like ICarly and How I Met Your Father (but thankfully not Saved By The Bell RIP)
The Big Bang Theory,"Probably.  Will join the other retired formats like Westerns, crime detectives, variety shows, etc.

That's why I love all those dozens of sub-digital/multicast networks that have popped up the last 5 years.  So if you prefer these legacy TV formats, you have plenty of ways/stuff you can watch!"
The Big Bang Theory,I am so glad the laugh track is going away.
The Big Bang Theory,"I haven't really watched a show with a Laugh Track since Seinfeld other than The Connors which I don't necessarily enjoy, but it seems like that format is all but dead. There are better ways to pull off comedy and multi-cam sitcoms in my opinion are harder to pull off as well as the single-cam variety. You end up having to act and write around real and canned audience reaction and that can hurt the story and the jokes."
The Big Bang Theory,"When one laugh track sitcom dies another takes its place

Not on the same level but cbs pushes them out like mad. B positive. United States of al. Et cetera."
The Big Bang Theory,Yes. Let's be done with laugh track.
The Big Bang Theory,Let's hope so
The Big Bang Theory,Double dog dare any person that like the show to watch it without the laugh track.
The Big Bang Theory,"Multi-cam sitcom are so cheap to produce compared to single camera and a much shorter time commitment for the actors, so they will probably have a very long slow death."
The Big Bang Theory,"Of course that's right, but I think that a list of live audience shows that didn't manipulate laughter in any way would be a very short list."
The Big Bang Theory,"Correct, that was my mistake. Multi-cam sitcom is the more accurate term to group these shows together"
The Big Bang Theory,"One Day at a Time (the Netflix/Pop reboot) truly had the best audience laughter I have heard on a multi-cam sitcom. It wasn’t just laughter but also cheering and hearing ‘woo’. 
The second season finale had no laughter up until a certain point because >!Rita Moreno’s character was about to die. When she didn’t die!<, the audience reaction was incredible and you could feel as if you were part of the audience. 

I love the multi-cam sitcom format but it sucks that not more shows have a more organic approach to incorporating a live studio audience into the final product."
The Big Bang Theory,The “laugh track” is the track of audio that the laughter is on. Whether or not a live audience is there doesn’t change the fact that if you hear laughter on a show there is a laugh track.
The Big Bang Theory,"I've been hearing that they're having lots of production difficulties and may not get off the ground at this point. 

David Hyde Pierce and Bebe Neuwirth are on record at this point refusing to want anything to do with the show. So at this point it would just be Frasier with no connection to the previous show."
The Big Bang Theory,I think the new Night Court will also be a laugh track and I'm really hoping it ends up good.
The Big Bang Theory,"> Cosby's show didn't use one at all

Cosby literally went on record saying that the reason the network cancelled the show was because he refused to use a laugh track.  

Most shows that use canned laughter from the 60s onward, did so at the insistant of the network. MASH, for one."
The Big Bang Theory,"Most of the big multi cams like Big Bang Theory would record in front of a live audience. Back in the 90s and before, they'd usually say that before the show started."
The Big Bang Theory,"That is my fault, I wasn’t trying to say Big Bang had a laugh track. I was trying to group together the style of sitcom that either have a laughtrack or live studio audience. I guess multi-cam would be the more accurate term."
The Big Bang Theory,"As long as we're on the Subject of the Laugh Track (which, BTW, Big Bang [didn't use ""per se""](http://chucklorre.com/?e=532), but they still ""sweetened up"" their Live audiences from time to time), we did an episode a few years about the History & Worst Usages of [the Laugh Track](https://telehell.libsyn.com/episode-17-the-laugh-track); and while the creation of the device Was Beneficial during the early years of TV, its purpose has long since been outdated thanks to single-camera shows outpacing the Multi-cam's."
The Big Bang Theory,"On the same token, I double dog dare fans of the Office to watch it without the interview segments or fourth-wall breaks. Laugh tracks may be on their way out, but it’s only because comedies have found other ways to achieve the exact same effect. There is absolutely nothing inherently wrong with laugh tracks. For what it’s worth, BBT was also filmed in front of a real audience, so the laughter isn’t even canned."
The Big Bang Theory,"""I double dog dare you to watch the assembly cut of a marvel movie without the special effects"" oh wait that wouldn't work because it was made to be viewed with all that in mind."
Pride and Prejudice,Sometimes I feel these headlines are straight out of the Onion.
Pride and Prejudice,"*The series, titled “Pride and Prejudice: An Experiment in Romance,” is an original format that will see a “heroine” looking for her “duke.”*

How hard can you miss the point of Pride and Prejudice?"
Pride and Prejudice,"If we’re getting a whole batch of reality shows inspired by classic literature, Lord of the Flies should be next."
Pride and Prejudice,"Im sorry, what?"
Pride and Prejudice,"OMFG...

You can take network TV out of the network but you can't get the network out of the Network TV."
Pride and Prejudice,So no Zombies in it?
Pride and Prejudice,"They tried it once already back in 2004:

[Regency House Party](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgZlGrTbZHg)"
Pride and Prejudice,"Pride and Prejudice, exact what every new relationship needs to prosper."
Pride and Prejudice,"What do you mean?  


Elizabeth was pining after every man she saw in that book."
Pride and Prejudice,Sucks to your ass-mar!
Pride and Prejudice,Be too good.
Pride and Prejudice,"Like Mr Collins? 

It’s more the ‘looking for her Duke.’"
Pride and Prejudice,"I was being sarcastic. 

I've watched the 5 hour BBC version enough times with the partner to know this is a dumb idea to base it on Pride and Prejudice."
Pride and Prejudice,It’s already had to weather Bridget Jones. Poor Pride and Prejudice.
Pride and Prejudice,Wait did they make a Bridget Jones dating show or are you talking about the movies?
Pride and Prejudice,The movies.
Pride and Prejudice,"https://www.reddit.com/r/janeausten/comments/8pdycs/1967_bbc_pride_and_prejudice_adaptation/e0bk91m/?st=jquk0md5&sh=d60d9027

The good news is that the British Film Institute has copies of all six episodes of this production. The bad news is that there's no way to view it outside of visiting the BFI itself. I've sent them a message on Facebook to see if there's any interest in releasing it onto DVD."
Pride and Prejudice,I'm not sure. That's going to be a tough one to find. You might have better luck over at /r/BritishTV.
Pride and Prejudice,your familiar with two sins ... how about a third?
Pride and Prejudice,You may already be aware but there's also a 1980 version that's easier to find.
Pride and Prejudice,"Ah, thanks for digging up that old thread. Just investigating the BFI site suggests that maybe it's difficult to just view at the BFI out of curiosity, which makes sense but it rather a shame. Oh well! Grateful for the help though."
Pride and Prejudice,"Thanks for reply, especially for recommending another sub!"
Pride and Prejudice,It's insane to think you can't find this digitally. Is this possible in 2019? Keep looking!
Pride and Prejudice,"I can second that, the first episode was really good, looking forward to the rest."
Pride and Prejudice,"They portray the loss of Fantine's [spoiler](#s ""hair and two front teeth"") really convincingly."
Pride and Prejudice,"I have loved the book since before I knew the musical existed- and I also love the musical, but the plot and character development are not its strong suit. So I'm REALLY excited for this."
Pride and Prejudice,"I also didn’t have much interest in the musical but really liked the 1st episode of this, more than I thought I would. "
Pride and Prejudice,The only reason I started watching this was Lily Collins but it seems a great adaptation 
Pride and Prejudice,"> We finally have an adaptation of this great story without all the songs  
  
Check out the Liam Neeson & Geoffrey Rush movie from 1998. That's always been my favorite version. I'll check out the miniseries though, didn't even know it was a thing."
Pride and Prejudice,Too much artistic license is taken - in some instances the polar opposite of the novel - rendering the series a bit farcical. The novel is a stupendous work that can only be fully enjoyed/appreciated when the reader possesses the necessary background knowledge 
Pride and Prejudice,"Just chiming in to say I’m really enjoying it so far, but wish I could borrow some of the cast from the 2012 film!

I think Ellie Bamber would have amazing chemistry with Eddie Redmayne (2012 Marius). I really dislike Josh O’Connor. 😞

Samantha Banks (2012) is the perfect Éponine to me, but I’d want to keep Olivia Coleman and Adeel Akhtar as her parents!

Give me Lily Collins’ Fantine all day every day though."
Pride and Prejudice,How does it compare to the 2000 miniseries?
Pride and Prejudice,I'm only past the first episode but this is really fantastic.  It looks and sounds gorgeous.  
Pride and Prejudice,"I just finished it today, and I really, really enjoyed it. I thought it was wonderful. There were only a few things I disagreed with, but the good far outweighs the bad. For reference, I've read the unabridged novel and seen the musical.

&#x200B;

**The Good:**

\-The inclusion of book plots that were left out of the musical (obviously that's the point, but it was still great to see on screen): Pontmercy/Thenardier at Waterloo, Monsieur Gillenormand, Fantine & Felix, Petit Gervais, Azelma, the ambush scene with Marius watching through the peephole, Monsieur Mabeuf,

\-Everything that had to do with Fantine was just excellent. Jeeze, I wanted to curl in to myself at the teeth scene I was cringing so hard. I thought Lily Collins was great.

\-I really enjoyed the portrayal of Marius here.

\-I liked that Valjean was a little more rough around the edges than he is portrayed in the musical. He's not always a saint--he's still human and his behavior shows that.

\-I liked the portrayal of Cosette and I found her to be way more likable than musical-Cosette. I loved the scenes with Cosette and Marius together, especially at the gardens.

\-I liked that Eponine was actually gritty and not a pretty actress charming her way across the stage like I usually see.

\-The Battle Scenes were very well done, including the Enjolras/Grantaire death.

\-I appreciated that The ABC actually felt like students and you understood how in over their heads they were.

&#x200B;

**The Bad:**

\-Javert is my least favorite part of the show. Not because they cast a black actor (I keep seeing outdated reviews of people complaining about this, get with the times people), because I could care less about color blind casting. I just thought the portrayal was way too uncontrolled and hotheaded to be Javert. Javert makes me think of being stoically imposing and quietly formidable, and I didn't get that from him at all. I did think his suicide scene was well done, though.

\-Did Valjean promise Fantine to take care of Cosette before she died in the book, or just in the musical? Because it was never said to her in the show and I was sad she died without him promising her that. But I don't remember how it goes in the novel...

\-I thought Enjolras missed the mark as well. The description of Enjolras in the book is one of my favorite character descriptions I've ever read, and I don't think this portrayal was true to that.

\-Marius & Cosette's first real meeting in her courtyard is one of my favorite scenes from the book, and I don't like that they exchanged names prior to that scene in the show.

\-Didn't love the ending shot with the kids? I thought a fade out on the candlesticks would've been just fine. 

&#x200B;"
Pride and Prejudice,Lily Collins is a boring actress. 
Pride and Prejudice,The second episode has just aired. Gets really dark.
Pride and Prejudice,Doubt you can fit the full scope of the book in to one film
Pride and Prejudice,What has been changed so far?
Pride and Prejudice,Can you give examples?
Pride and Prejudice,Just watched some clips of Eponine from the film and I have to disagree with you. The TV version is far better. Eponine for some reason in the film version sounds very posh and also doesn't have the same emotional range or chemistry as the TV version.
Pride and Prejudice,"As far as I can remember, in the book, Valjean wasn't able to promise anything to Fantine because Javert arrived and told everything about Valjean to Fantine, who got a seizure attack and dying quickly because of that. Which is more tragic."
Pride and Prejudice,"I was astonished to find myself crying during Fantine's arrest even though I'm familiar with the story. Fabulous cast, script and filming."
Pride and Prejudice,Watch it. The movie's scope feels pretty epic.
Pride and Prejudice,"Oh well, agree to disagree. 😊

I *do* think Erin Kellyman has better chemistry with Josh O'Connor than Ellie Bamber does, but I haven't been as enamoured by Kellyman's Éponine as I have with previous characterisations (including the West End's Elena Skye)."
Pride and Prejudice,"Gotcha! It’s been awhile since I read the book but only a few months since I saw the musical, and I couldn’t remember if they were the same. Thanks!"
Pride and Prejudice,"Okay, this is what actually happened:

Valjean takes Fantine to get medical care, but there's nothing they can do. She's dying. On her deathbead, she begs him to go to the Thenardiers and rescue her daughter. After she dies, Javert comes in, and he agrees to let Valjean have three days to get Cosette."
Pride and Prejudice,Would rather continue with the series
Pride and Prejudice,"No problem! :)
"
Pride and Prejudice,No problem! :)
Pride and Prejudice,"Game of Thrones I would say. It's a beautiful show with high production costs and a great story. Plus, it's still airing, so if you get caught up you can contribute to discussions. "
Pride and Prejudice,"I'd suggest Game of Thrones. The walking dead just isn't quite on par with shows like GoT or the Wire. I only suggest GoT over the wire because its still airing, and you'll be able to catch up and watch them as they air along with everybody, and be able to be a part of the whole thing. The Wire is finished, and you can watch that whenever you want. "
Pride and Prejudice,"The Wire.  My 2nd favorite show of all time.  

Game of Thrones is great, as well."
Pride and Prejudice,"Watch them all eventually. My order suggestion is...

1. The Wire (recently remastered in HD so don't watch the SD version)
2. Game of Thrones
3. The Walking Dead
4. Downton Abbey"
Pride and Prejudice,"The wire. Dont even consider the other shows, especially the walking dead. Game of thrones is amazing but if you have time for only 1 then my vote goes to the wire. Also never watched downtown abbey so i cant speak for it. But w.e you do, do not watch the walking dead. Its a waste of time. "
Pride and Prejudice,"The wire is the best TV show of all time.  

Glad I could help..."
Pride and Prejudice,"Game of Thrones. It's all of that combined and it's really awesome! I was really into the walking dead then I watched game of thrones and now the walking dead is boring to me, the storyline just kind of repeats itself while game of thrones storyline keeps going. "
Pride and Prejudice,"The Wire if you're going to watch it and give it your focus. You can watch the others if you watch TV with a tablet or laptop and still follow along. 

The Wire's beauty is in the details and David Simon assumes that the viewer is not only smart, but is paying attention. 

Also, if you're downloading it, there are 720p rips around. The show doesn't feel dated once you get into it. "
Pride and Prejudice,The wire. I've said enough already.
Pride and Prejudice,"Downton Abbey is shit, The Walking Dead is inconsistent, Game of Thrones is terrific, and The Wire is the greatest television show of all time.

That should help you make your decision."
Pride and Prejudice,"The wire is the best show, its banana town crazy pants good.

 thrones is the best modern show. for water cooler talk, but the wire is better plotted.

twd is a show you love to hate, its not a top tier show."
Pride and Prejudice,"Game of Thrones! To be honest, it took me two seasons to actually fall in love with this show but it was so worth it. The seasons are short but I think I was just too slow to follow along with it in the beginning. Makes my sundays that much better"
Pride and Prejudice,I've only seen TWD from your list and I'll say that it really isn't worth all the hype. Stopped halfway through season 2. GoT would be the best option from what I've heard AND I believe the next season is very close
Pride and Prejudice,Game of Thrones because it's currently airing so once you're caught up its just an hour a week time commitment that you can discuss with many people! 
Pride and Prejudice,"That's a tough one. 
I really like Downton Abbey. And The Walking Dead and Game of Thrones. "
Pride and Prejudice,Game of Thrones is the show I would pick personally. The Walking Dead isn't a very good show anymore. The Wire is excellent and would be my second choice.
Pride and Prejudice,"Didn't watch them all but not TWD, It's average, nothing more. "
Pride and Prejudice,"The Walking Dead. It's a great show but with a slow pace with season 2,after season 3 to what's airing right now: amazing. "
Pride and Prejudice,"Yeah, The Wire is a big commitment that requires your full attention. Watched it for the first time around this time last year and I wish I could watch it for the first time again. It's really a show where the more you put into it, the more you get out of it."
Pride and Prejudice,"No don't encourage laptop TV watching :( I hate that. My friends miss so many things because they NEED to do something else at the same time even if they're just reading people's Facebook posts or tweets or texting. I won't lie I used to do this but I realized it was ruining my TV/movie watching experience. I told myself ""just enjoy something and give it your full attention for once"" and I did!

Sorry for this completely random rant haha."
Pride and Prejudice,"Agree on all points. TWD is entertaining and I love it. As far as quality though, The Wire and GoT are in my top 3 of all time. The Wire of course is #1"
Pride and Prejudice,Have you had a chance to go through the commentary? The level of detail is unmatched. 
Pride and Prejudice,the..what?
Pride and Prejudice,Exactly.
Pride and Prejudice,Wives and Daughters and Cranford
Pride and Prejudice,"There are two versions of the forsyte saga, the pallisers, lark rise to candleford, north and south (not with Patrick swayze), the paradise, Mr selfridge, the house of Eliot, the duchess of duke st., Emma the new version, death comes to pemberly, he knew he was right, the crimson petal and the white, for tv movies the largest versions of persuasion, northanger Abbey"
Pride and Prejudice,"There's also The Buccaneers and Daniel Deronda which take place during the Victorian Era. Downton Abbey, P&P, Upstairs/Downstairs and a lot of other costume dramas are not Victorian Era but I love them too."
Pride and Prejudice,[deleted]
Pride and Prejudice,Why do you care what other people like?
Pride and Prejudice, Nobody will change what they think because of a juvenile rant
Pride and Prejudice,"> Why animation has always had to live with these prejudices?

You act like this is a riddle. Part of it is society and part of it is how series are created. A lot of early animation was directed at children or generally low effort. It's just over time that this stuff has started to shift.

> I also despise Disney's live-action remakes because they reinforce that live-action is the version ""for adults"".

I think you'd have a better case with the MCU, but instead of projecting your bias maybe you should consider they make them for different demographics. Some people love animation and others don't, but making both is sure to capture both markets.

> I also think that kids' shows, and kids' media, are treated too harshly. They can provide a sense of childlike wonder, joy and passion that while drastically different from the so-called ""adult"" shows, it is as worthy and special as them. I highly recommend this thread I made on this topic:

This also hinges on the series. Gravity Falls does a great job of capturing what you're talking about, some even capture people beyond that, but there are some that are firmly children's programs and just simply fun and PC.

> I also believe in art plurality. Escapism and fantasy are not inferior to ""realism"". I want all spectrums. From the most simple art to the most complex, it's all valid. And people should stop looking down at goofiness and silliness as ""inferior"" and ""childish"".

Personally, I think a lot of it exists in your head. Some people will have their beliefs, it's impossible to change everyone, but the scales are absolutely shifting. This is why Netflix is opting for some ""adult"" animation, there are cartoons this subreddit is starting to praise and anime in the West is quite normalized."
Pride and Prejudice,"> I also think that kids' shows, and kids' media, are treated too harshly. They can provide a sense of childlike wonder, joy and passion that while drastically different from the so-called ""adult"" shows, it is as worthy and special as them

There's a ton of peeps who enjoy The Teletubbies  
I don't judge them for that, just leave them to get on with it  
They tend to be less than 3 yrs old

I suspect that you are slightly older"
Pride and Prejudice,"Because (and I mean no offense by this) there is something wrong with your brain if you prefer animation. Call it arrested development or infantilization; a healthy adult just doesn't favour this over seeing real peoples faces. Rarely portraying anything close to human story lines that even children's storybooks do occasionally.
It just isn't *real* and brainless escapism and fantasy is seen as dorky at best or cowardly and avoidant most of the time.
Stop spending your freetime with secondhand childish banalities and start focusing on real things, like excel spreadsheets and timeshare brochures located in reclaimed swamp land"
Pride and Prejudice,"These companies are mostly all just trying to make money.  Often the medium is dictated because of the budget and scope of the project.  This is entertainment.  Some of it goes the extra mile to really challenge what we think and how we look at the world or educate... but at the end of the day it's all created to make money or else very little of it would exist.   You come off a bit as an anime snob... which is your right to do, but it's pretty off putting that you lean so heavy on the side of one style that you can't find the beauty in other styles.  And there are some amazing things to watch... even if it's all really just made because someone wants to make some money by entertaining our idle eyes and minds."
Pride and Prejudice,"Some people don't like it, don't like westerns, don't like sci fi, don't like lots of genre"
Pride and Prejudice,"You quite have an obsession with this topic, haven't you? I'm less obsessed with objectification of women in media than you are with cartoon being treated as inferior... which is not true, by the way, animation has always been a respected art form.

Some people are dumbasses because they denigrate people who like entertainment meant for families and kids, but the people who believe that changing kid's media into adult one by making them inaccessible by kids are even dumber (i can see a meme where the soyjaks point at adult-oriented animation and anime saying ""See? There's death in these shows, they're for grown ups aaaaa"" and are also the same people who shit on things meant for kids). Even if the Disney's live action remakes are not made for that bias, but for the 💲💵💲💵💲💵💲. I dislike these people, but you can't force people who aren't into animation to like animation. And honestly, even if i ~~was~~ am into animation, i can't blame some of them, a lot of people grow out of these childlike things.

Also, r/CharacterRant is holy poo poo: most of the users in there are just immature jerks, and some of the people there seem like they came out straight from the GamerGate community."
Pride and Prejudice,"Disney’s live action remakes aren’t intended to reinforce the notion that live action is for adults. It’s intended to make money. You’re over analyzing them.

Some people just have a preference for one medium over the other,and that’s fine.

What we need is more animation that is targeted at adults. No,I don’t mean “adult” animated sitcoms like Family Guy and its various clones. I mean non-comedic animation that is targeted at adults. Right now,you have to go Japanese animation if you want that sort of animation.

Animated adult dramas are definitely lacking. That may change a bit in the coming years."
Pride and Prejudice,[deleted]
Pride and Prejudice,"This stupid prejudice against animation needs to be exterminated from Earth. I'm sick of this, as a huge animation fan."
Pride and Prejudice,I care about their prejudices.
Pride and Prejudice,"""Juvenile"" is this stupid prejudice against animation and children's media.

EDIT: It is a stupid prejudice, downvote me how much you want."
Pride and Prejudice,"Hanna-Barbera cartoons from the 60s to 80s were generally low-effort. Animation in the Golden Age (1930s-1950s) was definitely not low-effort, quite the opposite. The Disney films, the Looney Tunes, Tom & Jerry, Tex Avery's cartoons and a lot of stuff from that era is beautifully and amazingly animated. The cartoon shorts were also shown before feature-length films.

Animation is a fantastic artform, and Disney should not live-action remakes, specially when they are so lazy and lack the charm and artistry of the originals."
Pride and Prejudice,Only a Sith deals in absolutes.
Pride and Prejudice,"I'm not talking about stuff like Teletubies. That's clearly to teach toddlers things like how to count. I mean shows like the DCAU.

https://www.reddit.com/r/television/comments/rx36st/why_cant_people_stop_being_snobbish_against/hrfw8zn/"
Pride and Prejudice,">start focusing one real things, like excel spreadsheets and timeshare brochures located in reclaimed swamp land

I can't tell if this is satire?"
Pride and Prejudice,"Animation is an artform, like painting! It is not realistic, and that's not the point of it! Animation is amazing at exaggeration and caricature, the huge artistry in movind drawings is insane!"
Pride and Prejudice,"I'm not an anime snob, I haven't watched much anime, though I want to fix that in the future. I love animation in general really, though I'm far more familiar with western animation.

Maybe I'm being an animation snob, but that's a reaction to how many people are live-action snobs.

Still, thanks for a great answer, far better than most in this thread."
Pride and Prejudice,"The people who don't like those genres you mentioned (and animation is not a genre, it's a medium) don't go around telling that those genres are just for children. While animation has stigmas and prejudices attached to it as beneath adults."
Pride and Prejudice,Late reply but to be fair animation isn't really a genre. I guess I understand it not being someone's thing though. I actually don't like that many live action things
Pride and Prejudice,"Great kids' media is not lesser than adult media. I don't like how people are often prejudiced in seeing atributes as childlike wonder, awe, goofiness, and more, as negative, as just for kids, as if those atributes were a bad thing. I hate the prejudices against those atributes. I'll also quote C.S. Lewis, writer of the Chronicles Of Narnia, saying ""When I became an adult, I put away childish things, including the fear of being childish"", and I also recommend his text ""Three Ways To Write Stories For Children"", in which he says that a kids' story that only kids enjoy is a bad one. Einstein also talked about how scientists are people with the awe, curiosity, imagination and wonder of children, and how it's a shame that so many adults lose that completely.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

If an adult doesn't get a show, that's it. They just don't get it, they should not say that ""it's because it is only for kids"". That's the part that pisses me off (even worse are the people who literally shame you for enjoying a kids' show, they call you an underdeveloped adult if you enjoy any of them!). I also hate people defending kids' shows by saying ""it's for kids"" because that is a backwards defense that looks at kids' media as inferior.

----------------------------------------------------------------

When people don't like Breaking Bad, they just say they don't like it, they don't try to disqualify what it is as inferior. 

--------------------------------------------------------

I also hate people that defend a kids' show they love by saying ""it's not just a kids' shows"", because that also means they think kids' shows are inferior.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

There are good users in r/CharacterRant despite my frustrations there too. But it can't be worse than r/television."
Pride and Prejudice,"When it comes to animation, a lot of the most brilliant, creative and heartfelt stuff is accessible and great for all ages, specially in western animation. Like Disney and Pixar themselves. That isn't worse than stuff targeted exclusively at adults. 

In Japan, people don't look down at the stuff targeted more at kids or teens as ""inferior"" to exclusively adult stuff. And animation also does everything. You have Ghibli, you have the films of Satoshi Kon, the japanese truly get that animation is a medium that can be used to do everything, including media exclusively for adults.

In western animation shows, I love the DCAU and Avatar The Last Airbender specially. From Japan, I love Astro Boy, and I want to watch Fullmetal Alchemist someday. And explore some of the best overall. 

Last, but not least, I'm far from the only person who sees Disney's live-action remakes as reinforcing the idea that live-action is for adults. You will find COUNTLESS animation fans and video essays in YouTube, as well as comments from animators themselves in the industry, who deeply despise Disney's live-action remakes and use many arguments similar one. It's a common feeling among animation fans. The Lion King is probably the most egregious ""live-action"" remake."
The New Adventures of Lucky Luke,RemindMe! 3 days
The New Adventures of Lucky Luke,"Who do you think would’ve have been better in an alternative universe, you as Michael Scott, or Steve Carell as Saul Goodman?"
The New Adventures of Lucky Luke,This is the announcement for the AMA not the actual AMA
The New Adventures of Lucky Luke,A steampunk western with scifi elements starring Bruce Campbell as a cowboy is such a slam dunk. That show should have gotten 15 seasons
The New Adventures of Lucky Luke,I fucking loved that show. I'm all for more Bruce Campbell in anything.
The New Adventures of Lucky Luke,"As long as comet is in it. 

Rip Julius Carry."
The New Adventures of Lucky Luke,I would give anything for this.
The New Adventures of Lucky Luke,I just watched the whole series again a couple of months ago. Man that was a great show.
The New Adventures of Lucky Luke,I'd rather have this than the Evil Dead series.
The New Adventures of Lucky Luke,"So, I did not realize this was an early Carlton Cuse production. It makes a lot more sense now, given the style and plots. Also, I had completely forgotten that Cuse had cast some of the actors from this show (like M.C. Gainey) for *Lost*"
The New Adventures of Lucky Luke,Please god
The New Adventures of Lucky Luke,The budget on it could be relatively small which makes it way easier for it to happen.  Wonder if HBO still has its Deadwood or Westworld sets.
The New Adventures of Lucky Luke,"I might be alone on this, but I want to see Jack of All Trades come back, too."
The New Adventures of Lucky Luke,"If he does, I guarantee he has my support without a doubt."
The New Adventures of Lucky Luke,"Yeah, but with that son, they'd have to call it the Adventures of Brisco County the third."
The New Adventures of Lucky Luke,Yaaaaaaaas! This is one of my all time favorite shows. I visited a place in Wisconsin that has a restaurant loosely inspired by this show called Brisco County!!!
The New Adventures of Lucky Luke,I just want a Burn Notice spin-off with him!
The New Adventures of Lucky Luke,I would love to see Bruce revive the character
The New Adventures of Lucky Luke,yes please
The New Adventures of Lucky Luke,I would be all in
The New Adventures of Lucky Luke,"i support this, i loved brisco county jr"
The New Adventures of Lucky Luke,Yes! Do it! :-)
The New Adventures of Lucky Luke,"I named my first dog Brisco.

Fucking loved this show."
The New Adventures of Lucky Luke,"Agreed, wish this show had never been cancelled, it was so good. Way before it's time."
The New Adventures of Lucky Luke,"Bruce destroyed me when I asked him about this at LA comic-con over a year ago, though to be fair he destroys everyone as it's his Q&A shtick."
The New Adventures of Lucky Luke,"You son of a bitch, I’m in"
The New Adventures of Lucky Luke,How close can they put Brisco County Jr. to the end of the western? they can make some fun episodes with that
The New Adventures of Lucky Luke,I fondly remember this show but I thought it wrapped up with the Time Travel Orb storyline?
The New Adventures of Lucky Luke,More Ash vs Evil Dead plz
The New Adventures of Lucky Luke,Yeah - I would give it a shot!
The New Adventures of Lucky Luke,"This would be a fun revival for a few reasons, but a big one would be the change of timeframe.  The original show was in the twilight days of West, but it has been 30 years since it ended.  It'd thus take place in the mid 1920s, so you'd have Brisco well into the age of electricity and modern inventions.  There'd be better cars, early radio, mechanical television, the development of talking pictures, more advanced rocketry, powered flight, all kinds of advancements that'd tie into its steampunk themes and we'd likely see some fictionalized advance versions.  Maybe Brisco has a bit of difficulty keeping up, but has his son.  It could be pretty neat.  Seems unlikely, but I'd love it.  Maybe a film or miniseries?"
The New Adventures of Lucky Luke,I live for this show.
The New Adventures of Lucky Luke,I was way ahead of its time for sure. One of the funniest shows on tv and the cast was outstanding. Julius Carrey RIP
The New Adventures of Lucky Luke,"Loved this show so much as a kid. Two moments I always remember...




One was with a main villain attempting to go after the MacGuffin. Two villains with scientist gearing up one into an old school diving suit. Scientist says he never tested it and there's a high risk of death. Villain in the suit can't hear anything. Other villain yells at the thick glass porthole, ""HE SAYS YOURE GONNA DIE!!"" Big smile and thumbs up from both. 




The other my sister and I would reference all the time: ""Too much weight."""
The New Adventures of Lucky Luke,"I've been rewatching it and showing it to my wife, and a lot of it holds up pretty well for being made in the early 90s.

If they did continue it, it would be, what, the 1920s in-universe? Could you have a Western vibe with that?"
The New Adventures of Lucky Luke,"When will the people responsible for such things just go ahead and give Bruce Campbell a free had/blank check. If La Barbilla says it will work, then by jingoes it will!"
The New Adventures of Lucky Luke,And Billy Drago :(
The New Adventures of Lucky Luke,I get so nostalgic for this show watching the Olympics lol.
The New Adventures of Lucky Luke,"On my re-watch I saw more episodes than on the original run. I thought the finale was when the Bly story ended, but there was a few weeks gap after that, and I guess they didn't advertise it and I missed it. A few years ago on my re-watch I was so excited to have 7 new episodes!"
The New Adventures of Lucky Luke,You didn’t like it? I thought it was a blast
The New Adventures of Lucky Luke,Same
The New Adventures of Lucky Luke,Just don’t have it on Starz
The New Adventures of Lucky Luke,Same!
The New Adventures of Lucky Luke,You don't know Jack
The New Adventures of Lucky Luke,"I'd rather have that than Brisco, but I'll take either."
The New Adventures of Lucky Luke,">Yeah, but with that son, they'd have to call it the Adventures of Brisco County ~~the third.~~ Jr. Jr."
The New Adventures of Lucky Luke,Sho Nuff!
The New Adventures of Lucky Luke,"It always feels llke Bruce is cursed to get the short end of the stick. Even his Burn Notice spinoff got canned before it got off the ground, and that felt like an obvious slam dunk between the popularity of Burn Notice and the popularity of his character. But then the network just went 'nah, we changed our mind'."
The New Adventures of Lucky Luke,"I've never seen the full series.  People forget how it was in the old days, you had one chance to see an Episode and if you missed it, it was gone forver(ish).  You might get another chance in summer reruns, but not always.

It was hard to be a TV show fan back in the old days."
The New Adventures of Lucky Luke,"I just, for once, want to explore the post apocalyptic Evil Dead world in live action, and at this point it feels like I'm asking too much."
The New Adventures of Lucky Luke,"No I did but, I mostly just fuck with the og trilogy. Briscoe could work easily on streaming and it seems like something you could can do more with. Lean into cameos like old scifi and western shows."
The New Adventures of Lucky Luke,It's owned by WB... so the only option would be HBO
The New Adventures of Lucky Luke,I never heard about a Burn Notice spinoff. Do you have any more info on it?
The New Adventures of Lucky Luke,Evil Dead's never been about the post apocalypse. Maybe in comics? But I prefer how they do things with small outbreaks of deadite possession rather than a run of the mill zombocalypse
The New Adventures of Lucky Luke,The rights to Army of Darkness were tied up for the show. That's why they changed S Mart to something else.
The New Adventures of Lucky Luke,You love to hear it
The New Adventures of Lucky Luke,"There's not a whole lot to talk about, it kind of fell off before it got anywhere near to getting off the ground. Basically Burn Notice ended setting up the possibility of a Sam Axe and Jesse Porter spinoff as the characters were left off joining together to continue mercenary antics. They got to the 'in talks to do it' phase and then USA either lost location rights or got into a dispute over a key shooting location and the project immediately fell apart as USA didn't want to go through the trouble of securing a new location.

[Here's the best article I could find](https://www.tvguide.com/news/burn-notice-spinoff-1068276/) which is mostly just Bruce saying they're in talks."
The New Adventures of Lucky Luke,"Both the original series and Ash Vs Evil Dead fell apart as each left on a post apocalyptic cliffhanger. The comics fill in where the movies fell off and they couldn't get a 4th one made.

Both a 4th Evil Dead movie and a 4th season of Ash vs Evil Dead would have been post apocaptic had we gotten them."
The New Adventures of Lucky Luke,"It had nothing to do with AoD in this instance, the season we would have gotten had the show not been canceled would have been post apocalyptic."
The New Adventures of Lucky Luke,WB's now owned by nuts who cancel shit on a whim (even after it's production has been fully completed).
The New Adventures of Lucky Luke,Thanks! That would have been a great series!
The New Adventures of Lucky Luke,"The theatrical cut of Army of Darkness didn't end in the post apocalypse. That's only the directors cut (which is missing ""good, bad, I'm the guy with the gun."")"
The New Adventures of Lucky Luke,Oh damn. I guess the budget was too high for the ratings then?
The New Adventures of Lucky Luke,"It was a few things in correlation, from someone that observed from the outside. It was on Starz which is already an obscure channel by premium channel standards, but the heads of the channel seemed to be excited just to let the show run and have it eventually be their GoT, especially with it having an established brand already.

Which was slowly working, but then by the end of season 3 there was new leadership at Starz(can't remember if there was an acquisition, merger, or what) and all the new executives looked at the show and went 'wtf is? Get rid of it'. Partially due to wanting to get rid of the old guard's stuff and partially because they just looked at it as an established brand show that wasn't doing as good as an established show should(which was partially due to piracy, but also largely because who the fuck has Starz and that was the point in Starz having a recognizable brand)."
The New Adventures of Lucky Luke,No. Why did you mention this show? Now I have to re-watch. You've messed with the natural order. [NATURAL ORDER!](https://youtu.be/jieaBFJFVDA?t=47).
The New Adventures of Lucky Luke,Fred Fredburger was a name known by every kid at my middle school.

The New Adventures of Lucky Luke,"It did have some fairly fulfilling endings for the characters by the end of the spin-off pilot film ([*Underfist: Halloween Bash*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Underfist:_Halloween_Bash)), what with Mandy becoming the President of the United States following a demon invasion of Earth (in spite of no proper series finale)."
The New Adventures of Lucky Luke,Clowns hate tangelos
The New Adventures of Lucky Luke,One of Cartoon Network’s best and a true shame the whole series isn’t on DVD.
The New Adventures of Lucky Luke,Scrape and lick.
The New Adventures of Lucky Luke,As a kid I loved it. I'm 29 now and tried watching a few months ago and still loved it but could only do 3 episodes at a time because Billy's voice is so fucking annoying lol
The New Adventures of Lucky Luke,"My favourite episode was the one with the skull head that granted twisted wishes. It was a full 22 minute episode. Pudding with the rabbit was very sinister. Also, the Grimm & Dracula road trip with the trucker that made fingernail sunglasses. Plus the invisible duck that kept farting. And the episode when Fred Flintstone came to the present day and freaked out at all the futuristic inventions."
The New Adventures of Lucky Luke,No surprise when it won Cartoon Network's first [Big Pick](https://cartoonnetwork.fandom.com/wiki/The_Big_Pick)!
The New Adventures of Lucky Luke,"""Hateful fart cartoon"" is going to be one of my favorite descriptions of anything, ever."
The New Adventures of Lucky Luke,"[They caused Property Damage, Like an Angry Woman](https://youtu.be/5vA5c5-7d-w)"
The New Adventures of Lucky Luke,"The alien ""brains"" song and episode is so good. I've also wondered why this show isn't remembered as fondly as others, especially with how popular Courage the Cowardly Dog is."
The New Adventures of Lucky Luke,Please pass the egg salad.
The New Adventures of Lucky Luke,Loved billy’s relationship with his adopted spider son
The New Adventures of Lucky Luke,"It's a really great show.

And it's actually a show that couldn't get made today as children's animation has become increasingly sanitized."
The New Adventures of Lucky Luke,To this day I still quote Jeff the Spider: [“Why won’t you love me dad?! I’ll be anything you want me to be!”](https://youtu.be/1kLUiInKFZc)
The New Adventures of Lucky Luke,Loved it.  Very few bad episodes.
The New Adventures of Lucky Luke,Loved it
The New Adventures of Lucky Luke,Definitely a favorite of mine
The New Adventures of Lucky Luke,"That was my favorite funny cartoon series I've ever watched, I loved SpongeBob too but I liked the ""evil"" and ""dark"" elements of Billy and mandy"
The New Adventures of Lucky Luke,One of my favorite animated shows and it still holds up
The New Adventures of Lucky Luke,Does it matter in what order you can watch the episodes? I see them on hbo max but they are out of order

There'd be better cars, early radio, mechanical television, the development of talking pictures, more advanced rocketry, powered flight, all kinds of advancements that'd tie into its steampunk themes and we'd likely see some fictionalized advance versions.  Maybe Brisco has a bit of difficulty keeping up, but has his son.  It could be pretty neat.  Seems unlikely, but I'd love it.  Maybe a film or miniseries?"
The Adventures of Tintin,I live for this show.
The Adventures of Tintin,I was way ahead of its time for sure. One of the funniest shows on tv and the cast was outstanding. Julius Carrey RIP
The Adventures of Tintin,"Loved this show so much as a kid. Two moments I always remember...




One was with a main villain attempting to go after the MacGuffin. Two villains with scientist gearing up one into an old school diving suit. Scientist says he never tested it and there's a high risk of death. Villain in the suit can't hear anything. Other villain yells at the thick glass porthole, ""HE SAYS YOURE GONNA DIE!!"" Big smile and thumbs up from both. 




The other my sister and I would reference all the time: ""Too much weight."""
The Adventures of Tintin,"I've been rewatching it and showing it to my wife, and a lot of it holds up pretty well for being made in the early 90s.

If they did continue it, it would be, what, the 1920s in-universe? Could you have a Western vibe with that?"
The Adventures of Tintin,"When will the people responsible for such things just go ahead and give Bruce Campbell a free had/blank check. If La Barbilla says it will work, then by jingoes it will!"
The Adventures of Tintin,And Billy Drago :(
The Adventures of Tintin,I get so nostalgic for this show watching the Olympics lol.
The Adventures of Tintin,"On my re-watch I saw more episodes than on the original run. I thought the finale was when the Bly story ended, but there was a few weeks gap after that, and I guess they didn't advertise it and I missed it. A few years ago on my re-watch I was so excited to have 7 new episodes!"
The Adventures of Tintin,You didn’t like it? I thought it was a blast
The Adventures of Tintin,Same
The Adventures of Tintin,Just don’t have it on Starz
The Adventures of Tintin,Same!
The Adventures of Tintin,You don't know Jack
The Adventures of Tintin,"I'd rather have that than Brisco, but I'll take either."
The Adventures of Tintin,">Yeah, but with that son, they'd have to call it the Adventures of Brisco County ~~the third.~~ Jr. Jr."
The Adventures of Tintin,Sho Nuff!
The Adventures of Tintin,"It always feels llke Bruce is cursed to get the short end of the stick. Even his Burn Notice spinoff got canned before it got off the ground, and that felt like an obvious slam dunk between the popularity of Burn Notice and the popularity of his character. But then the network just went 'nah, we changed our mind'."
The Adventures of Tintin,"I've never seen the full series.  People forget how it was in the old days, you had one chance to see an Episode and if you missed it, it was gone forver(ish).  You might get another chance in summer reruns, but not always.

It was hard to be a TV show fan back in the old days."
The Adventures of Tintin,"I just, for once, want to explore the post apocalyptic Evil Dead world in live action, and at this point it feels like I'm asking too much."
The Adventures of Tintin,"No I did but, I mostly just fuck with the og trilogy. Briscoe could work easily on streaming and it seems like something you could can do more with. Lean into cameos like old scifi and western shows."
The Adventures of Tintin,It's owned by WB... so the only option would be HBO
The Adventures of Tintin,I never heard about a Burn Notice spinoff. Do you have any more info on it?
The Adventures of Tintin,Evil Dead's never been about the post apocalypse. Maybe in comics? But I prefer how they do things with small outbreaks of deadite possession rather than a run of the mill zombocalypse
The Adventures of Tintin,The rights to Army of Darkness were tied up for the show. That's why they changed S Mart to something else.
The Adventures of Tintin,You love to hear it
The Adventures of Tintin,"There's not a whole lot to talk about, it kind of fell off before it got anywhere near to getting off the ground. Basically Burn Notice ended setting up the possibility of a Sam Axe and Jesse Porter spinoff as the characters were left off joining together to continue mercenary antics. They got to the 'in talks to do it' phase and then USA either lost location rights or got into a dispute over a key shooting location and the project immediately fell apart as USA didn't want to go through the trouble of securing a new location.

[Here's the best article I could find](https://www.tvguide.com/news/burn-notice-spinoff-1068276/) which is mostly just Bruce saying they're in talks."
The Adventures of Tintin,"Both the original series and Ash Vs Evil Dead fell apart as each left on a post apocalyptic cliffhanger. The comics fill in where the movies fell off and they couldn't get a 4th one made.

Both a 4th Evil Dead movie and a 4th season of Ash vs Evil Dead would have been post apocaptic had we gotten them."
The Adventures of Tintin,"It had nothing to do with AoD in this instance, the season we would have gotten had the show not been canceled would have been post apocalyptic."
The Adventures of Tintin,WB's now owned by nuts who cancel shit on a whim (even after it's production has been fully completed).
The Adventures of Tintin,Thanks! That would have been a great series!
The Adventures of Tintin,"The theatrical cut of Army of Darkness didn't end in the post apocalypse. That's only the directors cut (which is missing ""good, bad, I'm the guy with the gun."")"
The Adventures of Tintin,Oh damn. I guess the budget was too high for the ratings then?
The Adventures of Tintin,"It was a few things in correlation, from someone that observed from the outside. It was on Starz which is already an obscure channel by premium channel standards, but the heads of the channel seemed to be excited just to let the show run and have it eventually be their GoT, especially with it having an established brand already.

Which was slowly working, but then by the end of season 3 there was new leadership at Starz(can't remember if there was an acquisition, merger, or what) and all the new executives looked at the show and went 'wtf is? Get rid of it'. Partially due to wanting to get rid of the old guard's stuff and partially because they just looked at it as an established brand show that wasn't doing as good as an established show should(which was partially due to piracy, but also largely because who the fuck has Starz and that was the point in Starz having a recognizable brand)."
The Adventures of Tintin,No. Why did you mention this show? Now I have to re-watch. You've messed with the natural order. [NATURAL ORDER!](https://youtu.be/jieaBFJFVDA?t=47).
The Adventures of Tintin,Fred Fredburger was a name known by every kid at my middle school.
The Adventures of Tintin,Hoss Delgado is my homeboy
The Adventures of Tintin,DESTROY US ALL!
The Adventures of Tintin,"It did have some fairly fulfilling endings for the characters by the end of the spin-off pilot film ([*Underfist: Halloween Bash*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Underfist:_Halloween_Bash)), what with Mandy becoming the President of the United States following a demon invasion of Earth (in spite of no proper series finale)."
The Adventures of Tintin,Clowns hate tangelos
The Adventures of Tintin,One of Cartoon Network’s best and a true shame the whole series isn’t on DVD.
The Adventures of Tintin,Scrape and lick.
The Adventures of Tintin,As a kid I loved it. I'm 29 now and tried watching a few months ago and still loved it but could only do 3 episodes at a time because Billy's voice is so fucking annoying lol
The Adventures of Tintin,"My favourite episode was the one with the skull head that granted twisted wishes. It was a full 22 minute episode. Pudding with the rabbit was very sinister. Also, the Grimm & Dracula road trip with the trucker that made fingernail sunglasses. Plus the invisible duck that kept farting. And the episode when Fred Flintstone came to the present day and freaked out at all the futuristic inventions."
The Adventures of Tintin,No surprise when it won Cartoon Network's first [Big Pick](https://cartoonnetwork.fandom.com/wiki/The_Big_Pick)!
The Adventures of Tintin,"""Hateful fart cartoon"" is going to be one of my favorite descriptions of anything, ever."
The Adventures of Tintin,"[They caused Property Damage, Like an Angry Woman](https://youtu.be/5vA5c5-7d-w)"
The Adventures of Tintin,"The alien ""brains"" song and episode is so good. I've also wondered why this show isn't remembered as fondly as others, especially with how popular Courage the Cowardly Dog is."
The Adventures of Tintin,Please pass the egg salad.
The Adventures of Tintin,Loved billy’s relationship with his adopted spider son
The Adventures of Tintin,"It's a really great show.

And it's actually a show that couldn't get made today as children's animation has become increasingly sanitized."
The Adventures of Tintin,To this day I still quote Jeff the Spider: [“Why won’t you love me dad?! I’ll be anything you want me to be!”](https://youtu.be/1kLUiInKFZc)
The Adventures of Tintin,Loved it.  Very few bad episodes.
The Adventures of Tintin,Loved it
The Adventures of Tintin,Definitely a favorite of mine
The Adventures of Tintin,"That was my favorite funny cartoon series I've ever watched, I loved SpongeBob too but I liked the ""evil"" and ""dark"" elements of Billy and mandy"
The Adventures of Tintin,One of my favorite animated shows and it still holds up
The Adventures of Tintin,Does it matter in what order you can watch the episodes? I see them on hbo max but they are out of order
The Adventures of Tintin,"I still, to this day, reference the root beer fountain episode.

""Un*LIMITED* access, *to the fountain*"""
The Adventures of Tintin,Yes.
The Adventures of Tintin,F R E D B U R G E R
The Adventures of Tintin,Juuudge? Can I have some nachos?
The Adventures of Tintin,I think he's earned a free hotdog
The Adventures of Tintin,"""The name's Hoss. Hoss *(muscle flex)* Del-*(muscle flex)*-ga-*(muscle flex)*-do"
The Adventures of Tintin,"No joke, we literally just finished that episode and then I saw this comment."
The Adventures of Tintin,I'll have the chicken.
The Adventures of Tintin,"Honest to God I can remember being a kid and seeing a billboard with this on it. It confused the hell out of my Dad at the time I know. 

Hope I'm not the only one who remembers seeing that weird phase of CN advertising lol"
The Adventures of Tintin,Yeah I agree but at least it’s on HBO Max
The Adventures of Tintin,That's pretty much just Richard Horvitz's real voice
The Adventures of Tintin,"I love Dracula. He's not just Black, he's *Black*. 

""Everybody know Dracula turn into a bat! That's what Dracula do!"""
The Adventures of Tintin,"Actually, there were lots of great episodes, thinking about it. Underrated great show."
The Adventures of Tintin,"> And it's actually a show that couldn't get made today as children's animation has become increasingly sanitized.

While not untrue, Billy and Mandy really stands alone in this era and all Childrens TV animation. Only comparable stuff was on Adult Swim."
The Adventures of Tintin,The single bumper clip of Mandy quoting the tenets of satanism would have unleashed a firestorm of bad press if released today.

Bibi and Tina,"Politicians especially the President have always been celebrities and pop culture figures. Its how everything has been since Lincoln at least, but especially since the beginning of TV when talk shows and SNL became a mandatory tour stop for any president to seem cool.

and presidents don’t do anything anyway. thats why they have teams. 

and i would rather a president be on James Cordon than bombing foreign nations"
Bibi and Tina,"No, this is appropriate. As you said, she was a national treasure and like it or not, American presidents have been intertwined with our film and television entertainment industry (our primary cultural export) since Woodrow Wilson gave *The Birth of a Nation* his seal of approval after screening it in the White House. Think about Marilyn Monroe singing to JFK, Nixon on Laugh-In, Obama and Oprah, etc etc etc

If remarking upon the passing of an American entertainment icon is detracting the President from his other work, then something else is wrong."
Bibi and Tina,You are wrong
Bibi and Tina,"America has always treated its politicans weirdly.

I will definitely miss Tracy explaining that he had a monster hand because “they ran out of white makeup because I insisted they do my buttocks.”"

This is essentially a precursor to censorship."

Zack and Quack,"Statement from Estrin's family:

>“Zack Estrin was our everything. The best husband, father, son and friend. He loved to make everyone happy. He loved to make everyone laugh. He loved being a writer/producer and being a part of creating these shows that people enjoyed. But above all, he loved his family and friends. Thank you all for being a part of his life and ours.”

EDIT: Cause of death was cardiac arrest."
Zack and Quack,That's really sad. I thought the Lost In Space reboot was unique and had a lot of soul while staying true to a lot of the core themes from the original. Would have loved to see what else could have came out from him.
Zack and Quack,Sad when anyone dies at 51. Sorry I didn’t know who he was but my condolences to his family 💐
Zack and Quack,That’s super sad.  Does anyone recommend Lost in Space?  Always thought it looked amazing.
Zack and Quack,Damn. 51 is young.
Zack and Quack,"51, fuck, I'm 53."
Zack and Quack,"He actually had a pretty cool career. Prison Break, The River, Point Pleasant, Tru Calling, Once Upon a Time In Wonderland, The Whispers, and he got his start on Charmed and Dawson's Creek before producing that great movie ""Stranger Than Fiction"" with Will Ferrell. The guy made a lot of hours of entertainment that I really enjoyed watching. A lot of underrated stuff. This is really sad. RIP."
Zack and Quack,Oh wow. Lost in space in one of my inspiration to get into directing films. This really sucks.
Zack and Quack,That’s too bad….way too young. He did a great job with the LIS reboot.
Zack and Quack,Natural causes at 51?
Zack and Quack,Too young. Rip
Zack and Quack,🙏🏻. At least Lost in Space was able to get by Netflix’s cancellation barriers and saw a proper end.
Zack and Quack,At first i thought this must be suicide because of the previous posts on reddit on how devastated he was. Must have been a stressful period for him. The body can only take this much
Zack and Quack,since when did reddit become an obituary?
Zack and Quack,weak
Zack and Quack,How does one die of natural causes at 51?
Zack and Quack,"Agreed. That series took me from “really, they remade what?” to binging (edit: bingeing? How do you spell that?) each season when released."
Zack and Quack,"Totally agree, and it was a show that my kids and I really enjoyed watching together, which can be hard to find."
Zack and Quack,"Totally agree, it’s been a fun reboot that really was fun to watch. Sad that he won’t get to finish the story he helped start. RIP"
Zack and Quack,"It's really good. The story is great, characters are great, but the VFX are on another level amongst its contemporaries. Lost in Space was a real gem that really didn't get the attention it deserved."
Zack and Quack,Tears are words the heart can't express.
Zack and Quack,Mostly it is loss which teaches us about the worth of things.
Zack and Quack,"Some of the backstory falls apart if you pull at the sci-fi, a few big things aren't answered.  But it's heart was always in the right place and I really enjoyed it overall."
Zack and Quack,"It's a decent tribute to the original show, down to completely nonsensical logic. Recommended to anyone who likes classic sci fi."
Zack and Quack,"It's a fun watch. It's definitely one of the better reboots out there. 

Sure it's a low bar, but still, it's pretty good. If you're already this interested, definitely try it out :D"
Zack and Quack,Tears are words the heart can't express.
Zack and Quack,"Not really, unless you have kids and are watching it with them. It looks good, but the story gets rather nonsensical very quickly. It's a good show for kids, who will enjoy the young characters, the robot and the cool effects and not worry too much about plot holes or characters acting in an illogical manner."
Zack and Quack,"I’m the first episode they keep zooming in on that ugly Judy’s face to be edgy. I’d you can stomach that, it’s worth watching."
Zack and Quack,"It’s pretty cool, kind of falls off by the last season, less  believable, but it finishes the story.
The Robinsons are a bunch of geniuses who are in constant peril and keep going on the edge of chaos on their genius ways, mad skills, and somehow sexy robot. The techno babble is convincing. Just ignore anything you know about Relativity, there’s no time dilation to speak of.
Parker Posey is brilliant as ever at making you uncomfortable, but manages a sympathetic villain as Smith."
Zack and Quack,Granddaughter and I watched the campy original show and the Netflix version and enjoyed both👍
Zack and Quack,"Yeah, just how is this happening?"
Zack and Quack,"Damn, haven’t heard anyone mention tru calling in maybe ever but I loved that one"
Zack and Quack,Turns out people get sick at all ages
Zack and Quack,"""Natural causes"" isn't a thing. Not even when you're old. You die from SOMETHING.

Here it likely means some sort of illness as opposed to suicide, accident, or homicide."
Zack and Quack,"I lost a boyfriend I loved dearly to natural causes at 31, it was a pulmonary embolism shortly after he returned from a flight he took. It’s crazy but not super uncommon for healthy young people to randomly be taken. Unfair isn’t even beginning to express how I feel about that part of life."
Zack and Quack,"I think you are confusing it with [the ""Final Space"" situation](https://collider.com/final-space-pulled-from-streaming/)."
Zack and Quack,Devastated about what?
Zack and Quack,Shut up
Zack and Quack,"Stroke, heart attack, unpublicized chronic medical issue, cancer, etc. Did your body kill itself? That’s natural causes."
Zack and Quack,"Natural means something medical like cancer or heart attack, and not from a gunshot, car accident, a multi story fall, Inigo Montoya's blade, etc."
Zack and Quack,Bad Jeans
Zack and Quack,"Unaddressed diabetes or irreversible heart damage. There was some woman castmember from the Elvis film that recently died at 44 due to full blockage in her arteries, but I don't recall her being obese or anything. Then there's the slew of athletes with either blockage or undiagnosed arrhythmia like Jason Collier, Neil Reed,  Yinka Dare, Reggie Lewis and Darryl Kile one of the few near recent MLB pros to die while still actively playing."
Zack and Quack,"My moms father died at 39 of a heart attack. It’s young and sad but that’s why we got to try and make each day count and good even when it’s a bad day, try and have some great moments"
Zack and Quack,"My brother has a heart condition that can kill him if he lifts something over 100 lbs, or if it just feels like it. He’s 40. That said, cardiac arrest doesn’t necessarily mean natural causes. Hookers and blow can cause cardiac arrest."
Zack and Quack,"You’re going to see a lot of people suddenly die who are over 45 in the next 10 yrs. Long Covid has all sorts of blood, artery, and stroke related issues. Seriously. It’s just gonna be the norm. Not saying I know this is related but it’s not unlikely."
Zack and Quack,Happens all the time. Anterior MI leads to ventricular fibrillation and its all over in 5 minutes unless you have good cpr and interventions to open the artery.
Zack and Quack,I had a heart attack at 34. Probably because of how much sugar I consumed despite being at a healthy weight and being active. Sometimes bodies suck.
Zack and Quack,"Basically all that means is ""did not die due to outside forces."" It's sad to have a heart attack at 51, but I have no idea what his medical profile or stress levels looked like."
Zack and Quack,"My father at 50, my uncle at 50-stroke/heart attack-which are natural causes in medical terms. For us the family they died too young."
Zack and Quack,"The story finished.  The last season finished the story (Will Robinson being huge hastened that).

It was such a great family show.  Something that's not seen much these days.  A show that is fun to watch by adults and kids.  They didn't decide to toss in some random boobs and the plot was easy to follow yet very interesting."
Zack and Quack,Classic serial movie trope with a family of Mary Sues. Check.
Zack and Quack,"Ditto. Point Pleasant was really cool too. One of the better network antichrist horror shows. I remember being really bummed when it got cancelled. It was during Fox's slash-and-burn-all-genre-series era. Dark times (for Dark Angel, lol)."
Zack and Quack,"Natural Causes means you died from something internal (ie cancer, heart disease, etc.)"
Zack and Quack,"Very sorry to hear that! 
Terrible. I personally am very afraid of cardiovascular arrest / stroke / aneurysm - related death or debilitation, and I wish that cardio system health was easier to access and part of a regular screening process. 

It is absolutely unfair, that as humans we proceed to pass along genetics with total abandon and that it can be so random. I knew a guy who was in excellent health and jogged almost daily, who died of the same thing. Meanwhile people who are obese and sit around smoking all day can live to 85."
Zack and Quack,You are totally right. My mistake thanks for correcting me
Zack and Quack,awwww 😰😰😰😰 go stream on twitch
Zack and Quack,"Yup. Great Grandfather was 49, Grandfather 50, my dad 51. All heart attacks."
Zack and Quack,For some reason I always thought natural causes had to do with old age.
Zack and Quack,Who is Jean Renault?
Zack and Quack,Fucking Wranglers!
Zack and Quack,/r/boneappletea
Zack and Quack,Acid wash kills.
Zack and Quack,"> Long Covid has all sorts of blood, artery, and stroke related issues.

Any proof that this guy even had COVID?  It seems sort of crazy to put that out here like that.  To me, making a blanket statement like that is no better than saying “the vax has all sorts of blood, artery, and stroke related issues” so you’re going to see a lot of sudden death over the next ten years."
Zack and Quack,Yea you’re right I was thinking of a different show (the expanse) that left the story unfinished. Will and the robot going off on their adventures was a great ending (spoiler alert).
Zack and Quack,that kid really had a growth spurt
Zack and Quack,"Never actually heard of that one, I’ll give it a watch, thanks homie."
Zack and Quack,Exactly that's what I meant. Didn't say it as well
Zack and Quack,Yea exactly! You hear a lot about running related deaths due to heart conditions they never knew they had etc. It's tragic.
Zack and Quack,"It's all good, I had it mixed up myself at first because the names are so similar."
Zack and Quack,😘
Zack and Quack,[deleted]
Zack and Quack,"Christ. That’s terrible I’m sorry. Pancreatic cancer has taken my great grandfather, grandfather, and uncle. It’s sometimes frightening knowing that you can be predisposed to something like that. Take care of yourself."
Zack and Quack,I’m sorry to hear that. It’s a similar story with my mother; her siblings and both parents died at 46. Needless to say she was very happy to turn 47.
Zack and Quack,"My family is similar but with a 12yr gap. So for me it might be anywhere from 60-72. 
/remindme in 25 years"
Zack and Quack,"Yup! Great great grandma, great grandma, grandma all had heart attacks at 49. Grandma survived though. My mom had a heart issue but she very paranoid and had it checked out in her early 40s."
Zack and Quack,Do you plan to just live in a hospital for your 52nd year?
Zack and Quack,You have a time bomb in your chest.  Take care.
Zack and Quack,"> Any proof that this guy even had COVID?

40% of all adults have had COVID (as of June 2022) and 20% of those infected could specifically be diagnosed with ""Long COVID"" symptoms.

While there is no evidence of an association *in this specific instance,* a generalized comment that we may see a rise in sudden, unexplained issues related to our circulatory systems is something that IS supported by statistical and medical evidence.

As opposed to a claim about ""the vax"" which is supported by neither."
Zack and Quack,[removed]
Zack and Quack,"Have you read the expanse books? There’s a 30 year time jump…. There’s some people that say it will come back later, but it’s also a bit of a tough pill to swallow for a TV audience."
Zack and Quack,"Spoiler, but one that everyone would predict and still doesn't tell you what happened at the end."
Zack and Quack,"OH. I legitimately thought that the character had been like... ""Honey I Blew Up the Kid""ed for some reason which made the story go faster for some reason."
Zack and Quack,"Thank you. I do get my choloesterol checked. It’s fairly normal, surprisingly. A lot of those deaths, esp my dad was also due to smoking. I don’t smoke."
Zack and Quack,"As far back as anyone can remember no male in my family had lived past 63. Not a particular cause, it was more like a curse. My dad was the first to buck the trend. I’ve been enjoying the extra time we’ve had together."
Zack and Quack,Thank you. I was 16 when my dad died but my poor twin aunts were 2 when my grandfather died. They never knew him.
Zack and Quack,"Thank you. I do have other male relatives on my dad's side that are living past 50. That's a good thing. And much better health care exists today, no matter how much we complain about it. My grandfather would have lived in this day in age for sure."
Zack and Quack,"I’m pretty sure that more than 20% of Americans were vaccinated. The only real way to get good data on this would be to run a statistical  regression analysis on the cardiac health outcomes between populations with similar COVID infections but divergent vaccine adoption. I’d suggest U.S. and Sweden because we have similar infection rates but Sweden had very low vaccine rates. And if critics don’t like that (because Sweden’s diet tends to be better) pick another country like Canada v Sweden. 

The point is that this sort of research won’t get funding or publication under this sort of environment. But I suspect that we will start seeing the results of these types of studies looking backwards at the Pandemic in the 2030s…after the politics have died down."
Zack and Quack,[deleted]
Zack and Quack,"Ignore me if I’m prying, but have you been to a cardiologist? I’m curious what the protocol is for someone with a family history like this."
Zack and Quack,I do need to watch my weight but I move everyday. I get multiple 10 plus mile work days during the week and weights too. I’m trying!!
Zack and Quack,Hooch is crazy
Zack and Quack,Mr. Moesby was the GOAT disney live action character
Zack and Quack,"I was actually just thinking how interesting and cool it was that they switched the original casting plans.

Ashley Tisdale was going to play the dumb blonde socialite/Paris Hilton and Brenda Song was going to be the smart (asian) uncool friend. Instead they switched the roles and avoided the generic stereotyping you would expect from a Disney Channel show"
Zack and Quack,Constantly quoted ”Would you like me to set it to Am or FM!?” as a kid and still do as an adult
Zack and Quack,I still think about PRNDL often.
Zack and Quack,This was fucking funny.
Zack and Quack,This show and Drake and Josh were huge influences on shaping my sense of humor (and sense of sarcasm.)
Zack and Quack,"London Tipton is really great, really great, really great

London Tipton is really great and deserves the opposite of hate, which is love!"
Zack and Quack,This scenes hits hard when you know his personal background
Zack and Quack,"Aged so well. Remember watching this as a kid and loving Londons responses but coming back as a adult, it's all Moseby."
Brooklyn Nine-Nine,"Digimon, digital monsters?


Oh digman."
Brooklyn Nine-Nine,It's kinda too bad they're just voice acting when they're great physical actors too.
Brooklyn Nine-Nine,"Great to hear. They both played off each other so well and seem to get along great in real life. It makes sense they want to work together again.

Plus the series sounds really cool."
Brooklyn Nine-Nine,Cool. Cool cool cool cool.
Brooklyn Nine-Nine,Given Comedy Central's track record with animated shows & really most of it's shows I give it three seasons. Seems like if it's not the next South Park it's not worth keeping.
Brooklyn Nine-Nine,"Wait, Comedy Central is actually making new programming now?"
Brooklyn Nine-Nine,Name of your sex tape!
Brooklyn Nine-Nine,Best couple on tv before the shitty baby thing
Brooklyn Nine-Nine,Hopefully this is better than the last season of BNN. That shit was horrible
Brooklyn Nine-Nine,They would actually be a great couple. Like ashton kusher and mila kunis
Brooklyn Nine-Nine,"Am I the only one that immediately thought of Tadanobu Asano’s Digman?

https://www.instagram.com/p/Cigbe49JETe/?igshid=MDJmNzVkMjY="
Brooklyn Nine-Nine,Definitely like the sound of this but don’t trust Comedy Central at all. Cancel plenty of decent shows
Brooklyn Nine-Nine,Diglett?
Brooklyn Nine-Nine,melissa fumero is in the last blockbuster show. not sure what samberg is up to though.
Brooklyn Nine-Nine,"I know it’s a silly ass show, but they still had good chemistry."
Brooklyn Nine-Nine,Title*
Brooklyn Nine-Nine,Don’t know why you got downvoted when title of your sex tape is a running joke from b99 lol
Brooklyn Nine-Nine,"Agreed. I absolutely loved the previous ones, but the last season was a dumpster fire in comparison. 

I had to turn off several episodes due to them being just not funny and actually obnoxious."
Brooklyn Nine-Nine,They downvote cause you tell the truth
Brooklyn Nine-Nine,"Eh, do you mean IRL? Both are married."
Brooklyn Nine-Nine,Hopefully a new Lonely Island project.
Brooklyn Nine-Nine,"
>in the last blockbuster show

Okay but what's the name of the showohhhh it's literally called ""Blockbuster""!"
Brooklyn Nine-Nine,Corona commercials with Snoop
Brooklyn Nine-Nine,Because it makes no sense where he used it? Yelling references when they aren’t relevant is kinda lame and not very funny.
Brooklyn Nine-Nine,"Given the cultural climate at the time, I didn’t envy the writers. That said, the last episode was a good send off."
Brooklyn Nine-Nine,Yeah i dont follow celebrities so.. oh well 🤷‍♂️ haha
Brooklyn Nine-Nine,"No it's literally  called ""the last blockbuster"""
Brooklyn Nine-Nine,That’s what she said.
Brooklyn Nine-Nine,Lol why am I now been downvoted 😂
Brooklyn Nine-Nine,"Yh the whole attitude to cops really shifted post-George Floyd, which must have put everyone on the show in quite an awkward position"
Brooklyn Nine-Nine,Melissa Fumero’s real husband is the guy who plays the ‘hot puzzler’ that Jake gets jealous of when they’re trying to stop a serial arsonist.
Brooklyn Nine-Nine,"It looks like it's just ""Blockbuster""

https://www.netflix.com/tudum/articles/blockbuster-series-melissa-fumero-randall-park-first-look"
Brooklyn Nine-Nine,And Andy Samberg's real wife is the cellist in the final episode who harshly insults him. Boyle and Hitchcocks real wives appeared on the show too.
Brooklyn Nine-Nine,Was there a Halloween episode in season 8?
Brooklyn Nine-Nine,"The fact that they didn't end this show on 9/9 just speaks to NBC's incompetence. 

Still holding a grudge over My Name Is Earl."
Brooklyn Nine-Nine,Just a reminder that the Brooklyn Nine-Nine finale will air an hour early in the New York area at 7 pm ET due to WNBC picking up the Giants/Washington football game telecast at 8 pm.
Brooklyn Nine-Nine,I had no idea the season even started
Brooklyn Nine-Nine,[deleted]
Brooklyn Nine-Nine,"I'm still very upset that they took a week off before airing the finale episodes tonight. If they aired them last week, it would have ended on 9/9. How do you miss that opportunity!?! That's slapping fate in the face."
Brooklyn Nine-Nine,"Love this show, we only started watching like last year and had so many great episodes to watch.

Honestly really bummed with the last season. Everything about it just felt off/wrong and it seemed like they had little no budget or prep time and it shows.

Everything even down to the lighting just looked terrible honestly. Does it get better past episode 3? That's when we stopped this season.

I wish they had just waited and had given it the ending it deserves. Superstore did a surprisingly good job shooting and ending the show during the pandemic, not sure what happened with B99."
Brooklyn Nine-Nine,It always sucks when once great shows just sort of whimper to the end.
Brooklyn Nine-Nine,"I got shit for it when it first ended, but I said it then and I'll say it again: they should have just let it stay cancelled. The wedding episode would have been the perfect finale if Holt announced he had gotten the promotion at the end. Everyone's character arc had reached a natural conclusion at the end of that season and it could have easily been laid to rest.

Everything that came out afterwards was just running on fumes. They had a baby for fucks sake, that's how you know a sitcom has been running too long. It's not like the show was structured too radically different each season anyway. They all had a heist, a doug judy episode, a jason mantzoukas episode, an episode with Holt and Kevin trying to have a normal evening that Andy Samberg an the gang crash. Then we got three more seasons of the worst episodes out of all of those typical stories.

The series had run its course and could have landed nicely, but people just couldn't see the writing on the wall."
Brooklyn Nine-Nine,Good. Now give us a Hithcock and Scully prequel. O_O
Brooklyn Nine-Nine,"I really liked B99 at the start, but it ending now is almost a relief.  This season has been quite a slog to get through."
Brooklyn Nine-Nine,"season 1-5 were my favorite show of all time, remember seeing the clip of jake roasting adam sandler at an auction when it first aired and watched it ever since. then they moved to nbc and it dropped in quality HARD. should have ended at the wedding tbh"
Brooklyn Nine-Nine,"As much as I love B99, this season has felt super clunky to me. It’s missing so much of the charm that makes S1-5 amazing, S6 good, and S7 watchable."
Brooklyn Nine-Nine,The showrunner and writers said they didn't know what direction to take the show after what happened to George Floyd. It's become clear they never settled on anything that would be confused with funny.
Brooklyn Nine-Nine,"I binged the show right before the previous season and loved it. Got caught up and was excited about the conclusion.

These episodes have made little sense and worse they aren’t funny.

They remind me of that last season of the Boondocks without Aaron McGruder where the quality of the show faltered despite all the same actors."
Brooklyn Nine-Nine,[deleted]
Brooklyn Nine-Nine,Great show but it needed to end.  This last season was a chore to get through.   I think they should have just waited a year or two rather than go the direction it did.
Brooklyn Nine-Nine,"RIP to a funny, comforting, albeit lazily written sitcom. I hope we see Andy  in something else soon. He's so funny."
Brooklyn Nine-Nine,"this season has really been rough

They really leaned in to people hate the police"
Brooklyn Nine-Nine,I’ll say it. Thank god. This last season has been just unbearable
Brooklyn Nine-Nine,"It's been a decent final season, minus that horrendous first episode"
Brooklyn Nine-Nine,"I say this as a big fan of the show, but I wish they had ended the series with J&A’s wedding. Perfect place to end, and almost everything that came after was disappointing….especially this final season."
Brooklyn Nine-Nine,"Bruce Willis is still too big to guest star on this show, right?  I shouldn’t get my hopes up, right?"
Brooklyn Nine-Nine,"Season 8 has been a train wreck. 

We get it. There's bad cops and racism still rampant in our society. 

Can we get 30 minutes of comedy before we watch the news again?"
Brooklyn Nine-Nine,"I like the show, but it's going out on a low note this season"
Brooklyn Nine-Nine,Why not end it on season 9 episode 9 ? :(
Brooklyn Nine-Nine,It was all downhill after Jake & Amy had a baby.
Brooklyn Nine-Nine,"Now, will the last ep be a funny/ heart-warming send off or a lecture on police brutality and minority oppression?"
Brooklyn Nine-Nine,I just wished it ended last week so it could have ended on 9/9
Brooklyn Nine-Nine,Never saw this show. Is it any good. I love terry crews
Brooklyn Nine-Nine,I am… sad
Brooklyn Nine-Nine,"For those of you disappointed with the current season,  watch the finale.  It was everything you loved about B99, with a lot of heart thrown in too.  I think it was a phenomenal conclusion."
Brooklyn Nine-Nine,"not soon enough, i liked it in the beginning but it’s just rough now."
Brooklyn Nine-Nine,"It's not unusual - the show's been around for a long time, it had run it's course.  I do think the social commentary that they fit in might have hurt them a bit, as they tried to maintain a balance between sending a message and being funny.  When in doubt, always err on the side of being funny (if you're a comedy).

As a comparison, I thought the earlier seasons of Night Court were great like this.  Plenty of social commentary while still being funny as hell."
Brooklyn Nine-Nine,Well. Time to finally start watching.
Brooklyn Nine-Nine,Even the Brooklyn Nine-Nine is getting defunded...
Brooklyn Nine-Nine,"I just wish they didn't release a new season altogether. It's apparent they were extremely hesitant on continuing the show.   
Just stop it and leave it alone while the show was good. So depressing"
Brooklyn Nine-Nine,"I loved B99 but I haven't watched past episode 1 of this season. It was a DRAGGGGG. I get that they have to make a political statement. If they don't they will get murdered by fans and reviewers because obviously we watch comedy shows for their political commentary....    
    
I normally do not mind when a comedy has a serious episode or two. Even thought the episodes revolving around Terry being harassed by another cop for being black and the ones about Rosa coming out were done extremely well but good God that first episode this season was just too much and not fun at all."
Brooklyn Nine-Nine,Thank god
Brooklyn Nine-Nine,"This show tries way too hard to be Parks and Recreation but lacks the grounded characters that P&R had. Every character on B99 was flanderized from jump and there’s only so far you can go before the jokes become played out and the characters annoying.

Gina held the show together for the first few seasons cause she could be the meta commentary that appropriately dulled the contrived sappiness. They should have replaced her character instead of moving on without her."
Brooklyn Nine-Nine,I thought it ended last year
Brooklyn Nine-Nine,I love Brooklyn Nine Nine and was disappointed when it was originally cancelled and happy when it was saved from the chopping block. But honestly I think now it is the right time to gracefully end this show. While I think the show is still one of the better long running shows on TV I think the recent seasons have shown a slow but steady decline and allowing it to run much longer will eventually cause it to become a shell of what it was.
Brooklyn Nine-Nine,"I was *pissed* when 9/9 came and went, but the new episodes didn't show up on Hulu.

And I kinda liked the double header release schedule, but missing that day is just tragic."
Brooklyn Nine-Nine,"Started watching this show, can't stop, catching up, love it."
Brooklyn Nine-Nine,"I seem to be the only person who is an avid fan of the show from start to finish (at first I wasn't sure  but soon realized it was the only show I watched that season that gave me at least one good laugh per episode so I continued).

I don't expect every episode to be stellar, and I think this season was fine, considering the conditions under which it was made. I was very happy that the original cast was reunited for one last show.

It's over and will never be again. That makes me really sad. Also, it was the last broadcast network show I regularly watched. I doubt that I will ever watch another one regularly again."
Brooklyn Nine-Nine,Anyone else think Joe Lotruglio is slowly morphing into Yoda?
Brooklyn Nine-Nine,"Binged through the episodes that already came out last night. It was OK. The cast is still great but the show is definitely past its prime. 

I did enjoy Cheddar's revenge in the last episode."
Brooklyn Nine-Nine,This season is extremely underwhelming unfortunately.
Brooklyn Nine-Nine,Finally he can do another season of Cuckoo!
Brooklyn Nine-Nine,"I really wish we could get more B99 but at the least, I’m hoping for a heist episode with all the original members in it to send it off."
Brooklyn Nine-Nine,99 ending at 8? That's not right
Brooklyn Nine-Nine,But they didn't get to episode 9.9
Brooklyn Nine-Nine,I’m currently binging on Peacock right now for the 2nd time. One of my faves
Brooklyn Nine-Nine,Cool cool cool cool cool cool cool cool
Brooklyn Nine-Nine,omg I’m sitting at a bar casually and this just made me cry. I’m not ready for this beautiful show to end. Long live the nine-nine ❤️
Brooklyn Nine-Nine,"cool...cool, cool, cool"
Brooklyn Nine-Nine,cool cool cool cool cool
Brooklyn Nine-Nine,They really should have gone for a ninth season with a British crossover. Brooklyn nine-nine-nine
Brooklyn Nine-Nine,dont even watch this show and im sad
Brooklyn Nine-Nine,This show was over when they axed Chelsea 🥺
Brooklyn Nine-Nine,"Thank god, this season has been terrible"
Brooklyn Nine-Nine,"As much as I loved this show (probably my favorite comedy show), everything has to come to an end, and this went for a good amount of seasons, a good amount to either rewatch intently, or put on as background noise like I do with The Office.

Despite political beliefs, whether you like cops or not, whether you dislike their stances in some episodes, it was an amazing cast, a good story, funny laughs, and Terry Crews (I can't say more) 

Just sucks COVID kinda stopped it for awhile, but I'm glad where it ended."
Brooklyn Nine-Nine,My favorite part of the show was just how mediocre it was.
Brooklyn Nine-Nine,Wow. They really blew through this finale season. I feel like it just started.
Brooklyn Nine-Nine,My family and partner love this show. I could never get into it. The characters were just a little too cartoonishly stereotypical. Unfortunate because I love the cast as well. At least they got 8 seasons.
Brooklyn Nine-Nine,"Thank God, season 7 was terrible. I got 5 minutes into the s8 premiere and got bored. Now this is getting dumped before the actual shows they care about come out. 

Take it out back to put it out of its misery."
Brooklyn Nine-Nine,"Am I crazy?
I love the Office, Parks and Rec, the League, any series that makes you laugh...

but I couldn't force me to watch this past the third episode...
 
Does it get better after that?

I honestly find weird that I'm almost the only one not liking this show.

EDIT: Seriously, someone got an explanation?"
Scandal,It's a good entertaining show and surprisingly informative about farming and dealing with the council. They don't really hide the fact Clarkson has a massive safety net of wealth allowing him to take risks most farmers wouldn't which is appreciated. The show shines a light on a sector that is taken for granted and some of the hardships farmers have to deal with.
Scandal,The show is a necessary window into the hellish world of farming.
Scandal,From the title I though somehow there was a scandal in the show related with Meghan Markle and I was truly confused how that happened.
Scandal,"i think as much as negative press he gets. 

season 2 of this show showed a ton of glaring issues in the british farming community.

he had brought legitimate ideas to his council to help the farmers around him and the local community and was shot down at every turn. I feel like some people had an axe to grind against him but I think if  it was someone other than him would those ideas still get shot down."
Scandal,">The Season 2 premiere of Jeremy Clarkson’s farming show was watched by nearly 4.3M viewers on TV sets, according to Barb, the official audience research group.

>This was comfortably Amazon’s highest-rated show since Barb began reporting viewing figures for streamers in November 2021, per a Deadline analysis. It beat The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power, which launched last September with 3.2M viewers."
Scandal,"It's a very well produced, fun show. I don't follow Clarkson outside of the shows he's on. He seems genuine, and is probably an asshole, so if that makes him a genuine asshole, then so be it. Still a great show and I hope it gets picked up somewhere else."
Scandal,"I love Clarkson's farm. Mainly I love that he has a 20-something lackey that is so much better than him at so many things. 

But, the look on Caleb's face when he got into the lambo and begged Clarkson to drop him off at the carpet. That made the series, for me.

Not to mention learning about UK agriculture, which was pretty real seeming. Clarkson got to do a lot of that because he's already wealthy and he even said so much.

Admittedly, I missed the Markle ""scandal"" probably due to being American, was his column not tongue-in-cheek? I'll check it out."
Scandal,"Or... people were just looking forward to season two like myself. Don't really care about the Meghan Markle stuff, I just enjoy watching an ape farm."
Scandal,"Noooo, bullshit headline.  Clarkson's Farm, breaks amazon records because it is funny group of people and an entertaining show with some interesting insights into agriculture."
Scandal,"I never thought I would enjoy this show as much as I did. But man, that was so entertaining and legitimately laugh-out-loud hilarious."
Scandal,"This series just opened my eyes on how hard farming work is and they are being screwed left right and centre by many factors. Seriously, big respect to all farmers wherever you are!"
Scandal,"give us season 3, nobody who watches gives a fuck"
Scandal,It’s such a good show. I know nothing of farming and it’s a really fun way of learning about it as well
Scandal,“Fuck it. Lisa! We’ve got a pet cow.”
Scandal,"Say what you want about Clarkson, that show was one of the best fucking  shows I have ever seen. Superb."
Scandal,Show is fun I love it
Scandal,[deleted]
Scandal,Enjoyable show
Scandal,Yo what is the Megan markle scandal
Scandal,"What a load of crap, it has nothing to do with Megan, it has highest viewing because it is a fantastic show"
Scandal,Fantastic show.
Scandal,.. UK and its bizarre love of hating and loving the royals..
Scandal,"I can perfectly imagine him turning to the camera with a guilty look on his face and say ""oops."""
Scandal,We binged both seasons of this show in a week after checking out the first episode on a recommendation. It’s fantastic.
Scandal,This show deserves many more seasons.
Scandal,It is a fun show to watch
Scandal,"People absolutely love Clarkson and are more than willing to put up with his uhh, rough edges to watch his shows. I know I'll never be able to shake the joy of watching him be hilarious since I was a kid."
Scandal,"Turns out nobody cares. It’s only the media that gave a shit. Nobody even likes Meghan, her polling in the US is like -20 or something. And in the UK -32 in November. 

Amazon would be idiotic to get rid of two of their most popular shows in one go based on outrage from a bunch of people who don’t even represent the public opinion."
Scandal,Keep this show going clarkson is the man
Scandal,"People have been trying to cancel Clarkson for years. He’s an asshole, but I love him"
Scandal,"I’m an unabashed Clarkson fan and have been for literally most of my life. I grew up on a strong steady diet of Top Gear. 

This show is fucken terrific and I won’t ever stop telling anyone who’ll listen just how great it is."
Scandal,Do we like this guy or hate him?
Scandal,Well it’s a damn fine show!
Scandal,Probably got nothing to do with the controversy and more to do with the fact that it’s a genuinely great show.
Scandal,"So, the *""Meghan Markle Scandal""* is that this guy on this tv show said he hated her, and wanted to see her raped or whateverthefuck and so that is the scandal? 

Like, i mean, it has nothing to do with anything she did or said or even if she knew about the show at all or if she knew the dude or anything.

 It's just a *""Meghan Markle Scandal""* because he said mean shit about Meghan Markle?"
Scandal,"I love the show. I don't think that Meghan Markle thing should have been a ""scandal"". I recognized it as a reference to the Game of Thrones right away and although it was a ham handed, uncouth, and unwarranted thing to say about her, I never once thought it was meant to be taken literally.

Jeremy Clarkson is an ass, a bit racist sometimes, and a buffoon, but he also has good qualities as well. People are often too quick to look for flaws in someone and then declare that there is nothing redeemable about them, but often that isn't the case at all. I know a lot of really good and kind people who are also shit-heels from time to time. I think it's just as important to recognize the good qualities of people as it is to be wary of the bad."
Scandal,"That show showed me a lot that I didn't know about farming, and also how much I take for granted.

Plus, it was very entertaining. Kaleb is my favorite."
Scandal,I live in Barbados and I love this show …I see Amazon plans to drop it…I hope someone else takes it up
Scandal,"Not surpised....

Not only did it shine so much light on many of the problems british faming is facing, its simply a well made comfort TV that the Englands seems to be so good at churning out. I know he has season 3 locked in but amazon would be wise to renew. I can see him being offered a ton of money for this to continue elsewhere."
Scandal,"nobody in the real world gives a fuck about Markle, we watch because it's a soothing, funny, well made show about a cranky bloke trying to run a gigantic farm and making a fool of himself with the added bonus we don't have to hear about Ukraine and America for 25 bloody minutes"
Scandal,"He's a dick, and I abhor many of his viewpoints... but frankly he's very good at what he does. I've watched him since early Top Gear and to paraphrase Clarkson himself: I'm a dinosaur, but I enjoy what I enjoy. 🤷🏻‍♂️

Edited to add: as a cranky 40-something who rarely keeps his mouth shut any longer (sometimes to my own detriment) I also feel kinship with the fellow. Regardless of whether we agree on everything."
Scandal,Actually really enjoyable and fun to watch lol
Scandal,"What pissed me off was the council's decision not to give him planning permission for the restaurant. 

It would've helped all the farmers around him and help boost the local economy. 

They denied it because it was Jeremy Clarkson applying for it. It was entirely personal."
Scandal,"It’s just a good show. He makes fun of himself, it’s entertaining, and it’s surprisingly informative. No surprise here."
Scandal,"It's a good show. Watching it has nothing to do with the scandal. My only disappointment is I've finished the second season, wanted more, will have to wait, and there will only be one more. Jeremy Clarkson might do more for farming against inefficient, ineffective, overbearing and capricious government than anyone else. I hope that council ends up out based on their actions."
Scandal,I absolutely luv this show just finished 2ond season. I'm so happy he finally got hie restaurant. They are so funny.Thank you Jeramy for making me laugh.Cant wait for 3rd season. Oh yah bless you for keeping pepper as a pet I cried when I thought she would be ate.God bless ya'll.
Scandal,"It’s not just Clarkson, it’s raising awareness of the ridiculous hoops and red tape farmers have to jump through to make a living and the amazing supporting characters. Everybody from a small town knows a Gerald and Jared."
Scandal,"RESPECT THEIR PRIVACY


























world tour"
Scandal,"Being that I could give 2 shots about anyone related or associated to the Royal family. I thoroughly enjoy the show. He shows much emotion and anguish for the farm And he shows much character. So I really hope something like that doesn't ruin anything for him. Even though he's an ass, he is entertaining. That's all I care about"
Scandal,He is uncancellable. Love this series!
Scandal,"Eh, Clarkson and Markle both seem like self involved fame whores."
Scandal,"Show was a hit before Megan, not sure the ratings had anything to do with it"
Scandal,As an American I'm dumbfounded the hoops they must jump through to get anything done over there.
Scandal,"He isn't wrong about her tho she's a right piece of work, South Park totally hit the nail on the head about the pair of them."
Scandal,"Season 2?!  Yay, I had no idea."
Scandal,"I loved the show, I hate Clarkson, but love the show. 

I am surprised that the council isn’t constantly being doxxed, and constantly receiving hate mail.  They should have no economic issue as I assume his restaurant and store not only lift other local farmer’s economy, but the entire surrounding economy.   It seems where the folks in Wrexham mostly latched on and celebrated the economic boon of the money Rob and Ryan brought in, where these specific council members here hate that someone is throwing there wallet around. 

If I had his money, I would take every legal action available to me, sue them in the courts and non-libelously crucify them in the media.  The way the UK has set up local governments, seems like it is created to increase corruption and also for the settling of personal problems."
Scandal,"A scandal involving Meghan Markle? The sorority girl, actress, influencer, victim?

That Meghan Markle?"
Scandal,"No, it broke records because Jeremy as a farmer is deeply entertaining. The Markle ""scandal"" is overblown. Just read his statement from the next day. He's human, made a mistake, and then fixed the mistake."
Scandal,"Clarkson is a real knob, but at least he’s funny and charismatic at least some of the time. Harry and Meghan are just spoiled brats and crybabies."
Scandal,"It’s a great watch, just finished  both series and sad to see it go, I know he’s a bit of a grumpy old man and he has humour stuck in the seventies ( still funny though ) but he really shows how hard it is to run a business - farm and all the stupid regulations and council crap you need to deal with, I think he really wore his heart on his sleeve in the programme’s, love the guy hope someone else picks up series, he is great entertainment and all the people in the show with him.

Ohh and could not give a flying fxxx about megan, I watched it because it was entertaining and funny."
Scandal,Nobody cares about Meghan.
Scandal,"Amazon did confirm they decided on ending the grand tour and clarkson farm way before the markle comments.

grand tour has had declining ratings and viewings over the years.

 I imagine for clarksons farm they can only do so many series before they run out of things to do, plus I imagine for someone like clarkson and his wealth doesn’t really want to be doing another stressful year long gruelling labour for the next 3 years for more series."
Scandal,I have actively avoided anything Clarkson for along time now most of the content he creates just doesn't vibe with me. But this is a great show with important information that people need to be aware of.
Scandal,Still think they are stupid to cancel with him.
Scandal,"“scandal”   

wE wAnT prIvAcY!

edit: the quote is saying it’s not a scandal, it was a reference to the biggest series of the last decade applied as a mocking joke. If Meghan is so powerful, stop sheltering her.

“wE wAnT prIvAcY” is simply me making fun of the traitor to America. (Marrying a monarch? Treason if you ask me…) 

two separate thoughts. 

simp elsewhere."
Scandal,"The badger situation was pretty horrifying. That poor dairy farmer nearby.  Shining a bright light on TB spreading around might bring change or am I high?

We enjoy the show and get a lot of
laughs from it."
Scandal,"I don't think there's a correlation between viewers of his show and people who read his opinions on royals. 

I mean, I guess there could be people ""spite watching"" him because of what he said about her and they agree with it (by the way, he said he dreams of the day that she's stripped naked, paraded down the street while people throw food and literal shit at her) but I don't think it's that. 

His show is about the farm industry and sheds a real light into that area that's important to highlight. 

Despite what he said, I'll remind everyone that Meghan Markle *never responded* herself nor did any rep of hers. The Mirror, a British tabloid (or the sun, don't recall which), published Clarkson's opinion article about how she kept him awake at night by simply existing and was a bizarre view into what British tabloid propaganda can do to ones mind. It was disgusting and misogynistic and frankly insane but again, she never responded. The tabloids amplified it because it's negative and about her. Just like I bet they'll spin this into ""people hate Meghan so much they watch Clarkson's show""."
Scandal,I’m so glad that people had the common sense to not boycott the show because of a harmless remark about a rich woman who won’t shut up about how hard her life is.
Scandal,"South Park had the best portrayal of Harry & Meghan.

Clarkson made a Game of Thrones reference and anyone who got upset about it is a moron for not recognizing that"
Scandal,"I do love how much this drives farmers insane here in the states, it’s a favorite show of mine. I showed it to the Iowa farmers in my family and they all started tearing their hair out 😭"
Scandal,That cow saved season 4.
Scandal,UK farming is nuts! How do they expect their farmers to survive!
Scandal,"I don’t connect the two, I liked season 1 so I watched season 2. It was not because of a scandal that I watched."
Scandal,Clarkson gonna Clarkson
Scandal,All those yellow cones that the council put down are now famous right? Wonder how many of them are going to get nicked and put on Ebay as souvenirs 🤣
Scandal,What's Meghan Markle doing in the title lol
Scandal,Love this show!
Scandal,"It’s great show. Funny, educational and entertaining"
Scandal,Wait…sooo……lemme get this straight….they don’t give a shit about them either? Fantastic.
Scandal,Or maybe it’s a really good show…
Scandal,never would have guessed /s guess the world privacy tour will have to continue to try and compete with the farmer
Scandal,I was a big Top Gear fan but this is frankly the most important work of Clarkson's career. It's hugely informative and entertaining
Scandal,"They keep trying to cancel Jeremy Clarkson but it's impossible... that man is made of teflon. Everyone knows he says stupid things and he freely admits it, and most viewers could care less who he pisses off. The whole thing is frankly amusing."
Scandal,Can stupid companies stop giving in to cancel culture. That was a fantastic season of Clarkson's Farm
Scandal,The UK wouldn’t let a rant get in the way of their hate for Megan Markle.
Scandal,Did anyone comment on Caleb’s racing stripe looks like a hitler stash?
Scandal,Need more shows like Clarksons in many different professions. So many different walks of life and each one of them have their own problems.
Scandal,"I haven't watched the latest season yet, but the first season was one of the most pleasant surprises for a tv show in recent memory."
Scandal,That council seriously had a personal vendetta against him.  Denying a country road?
Scandal,I don’t know who any of these people are
Scandal,It is such an enjoyable show.  Really shows how hard farming is. Big respect to the farmers
Scandal,And what a stupid scandal that was
Scandal,"Whenever you see the word ""As"" in a headline, it's a signal that the author is trying to make a connection between two things which there is little to no evidence are related."
Scandal,I thought it was ok what he said fuck what those two think
Scandal,"Dude isn't evil. But Internet/twitter culture is now where if you do not line up perfectly, you might as well be a Nazi. Its absurd. UK comes off as even more into than than US. Maybe cause Fox pundits sort of keeps the bar lowered here.

That aside, the show is entertaining. Shows some pretty universal problems with small & local govts.  Its crazy to think how much control you do not have over your own land that you are taxed for."
Scandal,"I don't live in the UK, I don't know much about the royal family, I don't get the Meghan hate."
Scandal,"The show was good but it was a bit contrived in places compared to the 1st series, going a bit 'Top Gear'. Something would happen and then Charlie would 'appear' smiling in the middle of the field from out of nowhere to tell him he's doing it wrong or Clarkson would bugger something up that there's no way he'd normally bugger up, just as Kaleb happens to be there to tell him off etc. The main content was good but those bits were all a bit unbearable."
Scandal,"He’s a known pompous ass, but highly entertaining!!  Watched S2 twice already because I can’t enough of Jeez.."
Scandal,"I wish he wasn’t such a fucking idiot sometimes because he’s a phenomenal presenter and his shows are incredibly enjoyable. Maybe just be less of a dick. I mean who even lacks enough self respect to write for the Sun, let alone the self awareness required to publish such needlessly stupid stuff about Markle."
Scandal,Clarksons a dick but more importantly he's an entertaining dick
Suits,I wonder if he will encounter the C1A in this movie.
Suits,"I guess the copy editor is on vacation. It's MI6, not M16. The article gets it right only in a quote, which I assume was copied and pasted instead of retyped.

The UK's Secret Intelligence Service (SIS) was originally Military Intelligence, Section 6 (MI6) and the abbreviation stuck."
Suits,I don't know if I can watch this. It will be unsettling to see Charlie Cox making eye contact.
Suits,Hi.  I'm an AK-47 agent.
Suits,This man only gets hotter I swear
Suits,"\[Marvel actor does a non-Marvel project\]

It's Treason then."
Suits,"I love that RED TIE, It suits him."
Suits,He’s playing a gun? Awesome. Charlie Cox is versatile enough to do it.
Suits,"he will be facing an enemy from the past, bigger, stronger, smarter, shinier, the M60"
Suits,"good, wanted some espionage series"
Suits,At this point I can see a picture of Charlie Cox and not think he looks blind.
Suits,They even have him in the dark red tie 😈
Suits,"M16? Come on, man."
Suits,It and I not a 1. M16 HAHAHAH
Suits,"Nice to see him getting work outside of Daredevil, wouldn't want him to never play literally any other role again!"
Suits,Why does he look blind
Suits,"
What is this fucking headline. Took me a couple minutes because I was like, wait, what does Treason have to do with Born Again and why is Daredevil pretending to be an M16 agent?"
Suits,"That’s M I 6, ( Em Eye Six ) and the lack of serifs on the Apple Font is a curse on all mankind."
Suits,"Finally, I desperately needed some more cox in my life."
Suits,M I 6.  Not m16
Suits,"Will this be his audition for the new 007? Anytime there is going to be a new Bond and I see a ""young"" British actor take on a spy/action role, it feels like an audition."
Suits,So is he a M16A1 or an M16A2?
Suits,When do we get to see him as the next Casanova in a Casanova sequel?
Suits,I hope he remembers to look at the other actors instead of past them. Apparently that’s why he didn’t get the role of young Han Solo when he auditioned for it. He had trained himself to play blind for Daredevil and forgot to stop.
Suits,Well now we know op is a paid shiller because he copied M16 lol. And how dumb are collider authors to not know what they are talking about? there's like hundred of spy films/show and it's always mi6 not m16
Suits,"After starting Daredevil, he really didn’t do much else."
Suits,Wuff!
Suits,MI6 not M16
Suits,What is M16?
Suits,He is costumed as a rifle? Transformers?
Suits,I’m down for anything Charlie Cox is in. Fantastic actor.
Suits,"I swear for like 2 seconds I was thinking ""but that sounds hard to do considering he's blind"""
Suits,Where are his sunglasses?
Suits,That suit jacket is too tight. The dreaded X at the button
Suits,Going to have to check it out but the plot sounds generic af
Suits,He should play a brother to Robert Pattinson in something. That would be a cool dynamic.
Suits,Charlie cox and ciaran hinds in another project together is nice to see.
Suits,No it's the Russian KFC
Suits,And FB1
Suits,Maybe he's an M16 assault rifle agent
Suits,Capital I’s and 1’s are hard!
Suits,What color is the outhouse at Hereford?
Suits,They're actually talking about his rating in the movie. He plays an agent meant for Mature audiences (16+).
Suits,Maybe he’s going to team up with the FB1 or the C1A?
Suits,"MI6 is roughly the equivalent of the American CIA, and MI5 is their FBI."
Suits,You mean he isnt dressing up as a gun? They lost one viewer
Suits,"Originally it was the Secret Service Bureau. MI6 became a ""flag of convenience"" at the start of the Secret World War:

https://www.sis.gov.uk/our-history.html#section-1920"
Suits,It messes him up too. [He thinks he bombed a Star Wars audition because he was reflexively acting blindly.](https://www.radiotimes.com/movies/how-playing-daredevil-ruined-charlie-coxs-star-wars-audition/)
Suits,Hey!  I'm an M-16 Agent.  Did we just become best friends?
Suits,M6 toll is the supervillain
Suits,Tackling crimes in and around the Greater Manchester area.
Suits,"He already had work outside of Daredevil - he went on that whole-year run of his Broadway play with Tom Hiddleston, and last year had that Irish crime show Kin with Aiden Gillen on AMC."
Suits,I love Charlie but he's got the face of a good bloke. Not sure he'd be charismatic enough to carry Bond
Suits,"Paid shiller? Y'all conspirators are weird, this is literally my first post in this sub and I posted/shared the article because I like Charlie and yes I copied and pasted the link which automatically put the title and I was just too lazy to check to see the typo. Not that freaking deep."
Suits,"I’d say he was one of the luckier Daredevil cast, in that he has been somewhat busy since the hiatus. His other show “Kin” has been renewed, and he did Westend and Broadway."
Suits,Well Covid happened on top of being told to probably keep his schedule clear as Disney immediately went to work on the DD cinematic universe once Netflix exclusivity ended.
Suits,Is that the one that comes with Sarin dipping sauce? Yummmmmm
Suits,Lower case L's have entered the chat

I don’t know why, but this line from The Imitation Game always stuck in my head."
Suits,"MI5 has no powers of investigation, so it really isn’t."
Suits,Look at me!
Suits,"He'd ace another blind character though.

(Although he probably doesn't want to get stuck in a hole where he's known as the blind character guy.)"
Suits,Can I join the group? I'm a member of the FB1.
Suits,Madferit
Suits,It's not a typo if it's used over and over again. If you've read the article before posting you would have known that. And if you weren't a paid shiller you would have made the correction.
Suits,"""What if we printed default passwords in a sanserif font but also used lower case 'L', the number 1, and capital 'i' in the possible characters"""

Suits,"Hol up. I just thought of something...

Suits,Come on and kick me
Suits,Sounds like hype for a new series to me
Suits,"Yup, he should have just ignored it."
Suits,">Dunbar sued in February after his requests for both a religious exemption and medical exemption based on an undisclosed disability were denied. His contract had over $1.3 million left to be paid out, according to the complaint.

If he was making that much for only a recurring guest stint, how much does the main cast make? 

I feel bad for the actor who played his husband because he ultimately lost his job too over this as both characters left town."
Suits,"Whittled down? Is that a legal term, or is Hollywood Reporter just being weird?"
Suits,"So an ""injection"" of a ""man made substance"" doesn't apply to tattoo ink then?

DUNBAR: I have 12. I have one that is an ancient character meaning power and strength in every situation. I did my research so I know it doesn’t say pork fried rice or something like that. There has to be something halfway sadistic about being an artist and there is a part of me that enjoys the pain of getting tattoos. There’s something somewhat orgasmic about it. It’s like excruciating ecstasy. The first tattoo I got was with my girlfriend in junior high. Since then it’s become like an addiction that I will keep quiet."
Suits,"Shame.

always liked this dude in The mentalist and Prison Break.

Is ""Church of Universal Wisdom"" even protected as a religion?

> ""The Congregation of Universal Wisdom asserts that injection of any medication or other man-made substance would violate the sanctity of the body. ""

Also there is no fucking way those members dont take any injections, like do they just die if they happen to need surgery of some kind?

unless there is a loophole for them somewhere, dont really care to look for it tho."
Suits,"> Church of Universal Wisdom

The Adam Warlock villains?"
Suits,[deleted]
Suits,"I'm catholic. The pope came out out and said there is no restriction on getting the covid vaccine. Yet right wing biships and priests in certain areas of the US were giving people written eeligious exemptions to take to their employers. Locally a group of nurses, who are supposed to based in science, were let go from tbe local hospital because they refused to get vaccinated. I have no sympathy for these nurses. And while I like Mr. Dunbar as an actor, I have no sympathy for him either  It's so apparent, that many of the people who ran out to get a religious exemption, weren't getting them for an actual religious belief, but for political reasons"
Suits,"You would think that ""universal wisdom"" would be a synonym for ""common sense,"" but apparently not."
Suits,">A federal judge has trimmed a lawsuit from Rockmond Dunbar, a former actor on *911*, over his dismissal from the hit drama series for refusing to get the COVID-19 vaccine.

>Disney and 20th Television no longer face a disparate impact claim, which accused them of advancing a vaccination policy discriminating against followers of the Church of Universal Wisdom.

>They still face 10 other claims, ranging from religious and racial discrimination to retaliation and breach of contract.

>Dunbar sued in February 2022 after his requests for both a religious exemption and medical exemption based on an undisclosed disability were denied. His contract had over $1.3 million left to be paid out.

>Dunbar claims he’s been placed on a “do not hire” list over his refusal to get the vaccine.

Antivaxxers love a “medical exemption based on an undisclosed disability.” And they want the right to refuse a vaccination, but deny anyone else’s right to not want to hire them."
Suits,"Anyone wanna join my new church, the church of really smart? We plan on suing the IRS because the Holy Spirit told us that only everyone not a member of our church should pay taxes, but we are the chosen should receive the benefits of said taxes. 

We can also run red lights, poop in water towers, and nothing is ever our fault."
Suits,"So, if this guy and his religobuds are serious, then we won't see them in hospitals when they get sick, right?   Or because this is an injection only thing they can still get... x-rays or nebulizer treatments."
Suits,"Film sets can be so small and cramp, with people from so many places there. I don't know why you wouldn't want a ton of vaccines. I can only imagine people get sick easily."
Suits,"Lol the network and the show is totally trying to spite him. They’ve mentioned his character and his fiancé in I think every single episode this season so far. It’s not a huge loss though, he was a main character but since he’s not a first responder all of his storylines were adjacent to Athena and Bobby’s and mostly about the kids"
Suits,That guy is a total idiot and not even a good actor.
Suits,..still 1/3 million to be paid out??? He makes that much!?
Suits,"Loved him in Terriers, Prison Break and Sons of Anarchy. Seemed like a cool dude and it sucks he didn't want to take one for the team."
Suits,"Maybe don't be anti-vax idiots and you'd still have your job.

I hope he doesn't have kids."
Suits,"Oh, that's right. He left the show.

Val Kilmer is a Christian scientist, and he's been dying for awhile. That is his choice.

You can't refuse a vaccine, then sue because your employer doesn't want you to spread a virus to other people."
Suits,Golly. Where else will they find other actors to fill those roles?
Suits,Him and Emilio Estevez. Torching their own careers because of vax scares.
Suits,Flat Earther’s kinda crowd. Now that’s diversity no one is talking about!
The Office (U.S.),Heh. Way to rub it in to American Netflix users :P
The Office (U.S.),"It’s been on UK Netflix since 1st January 2021.

I was up to Season 8 on 31st December 2019 (using a VPN to watch US Netflix), and it was great being able to just turn on Netflix and watch The Office in the UK so easily the next day."
The Office (U.S.),It’s also on Netflix Australia.
The Office (U.S.),Sweden too.
The Office (U.S.),"Wait, Peacock got no plans in launching in UK?"
The Office (U.S.),thats what she said
The Office (U.S.),VPNs are a different breed. SurfShark and Nord both have working ones but you gotta play around with the different servers
The Office (U.S.),For uk netflix my VPN doesnt seem to work somehow.. netflix still locates me in germany. It worked fine to the us though
The Office (U.S.),"No, it's definitely just been available on UK Netflix since 1st January this year. It was available previously, but think it left back in 2015/2016."
The Office (U.S.),"Don’t think so, a lot of the newbies don’t plan on it, I think HBO Max is stuck in deals with Sky and stuff"
The Office (U.S.),"Sorry mate, senior error on my part. I meant 2021 and not 2020. Forgot the year has changed now haha."
The Office (U.S.),The Office
The Office (U.S.),The office
The Office (U.S.),Scrubs
The Office (U.S.),"Probably The Office, although I haven't watched enough of Scrubs to really justify that. Can't seem to get into it."
The Office (U.S.),"They're both good, but they can't really be compared.  It would be like comparing an apple to... some other, not apple fruit."
The Office (U.S.),"Scrubs.  Janitor was one of my favorite television characters.  Also, loved the musical episode."
The Office (U.S.),"They're two completely different comedies, from the way they're shot, the format they're presented in to the use of their soundtracks (or lack thereof in the office's case). That said, I think I prefer Scrubs because while The Office made me laugh, Scrubs made a feel a whole range of emotions as well as make me laugh."
The Office (U.S.),"The Office

This may seem weird, but I like Scrubs when I don’t hear J.D.’s voice over. It’s a good show, just not in my tastes. The scenes without J.D. make me laugh my ass off, but idk what it is about his thoughts that pull me out of it. I think it’s because it’s pull-away humor, which Seth McFarlane has made me overly aversive to. It’s good in Scrubs, it’s just not my taste though."
The Office (U.S.),"Scrubs. 

But I like The Office just fine.

I can imagine a Scrubs/The Office crossover.  Maybe the Dunder Mifflin crew goes to California for a paper conference, and then someone (Michael, obvs) does some boneheaded shit and they end up having to go to the hospital.  I would like to see Cox vs Schrute.  That would be the ultimate battle of the bastards."
The Office (U.S.),Yes
The Office (U.S.),"Scrubs for me, The Office isn’t my kind of humour."
The Office (U.S.),Scrubs!
The Office (U.S.),"The Office. Scrubs definitely had it's moments, but I find it very grating if I watch too many episodes."
The Office (U.S.),"Scrubs. 

I don't mind The Office but I just don't think it's the greatest show in the history of television like a lot of people do nowadays."
The Office (U.S.),Both were excellent. Both came to a shitty crashing ending. But I’m partial to Scrubs because my husband is a physician and he and his colleagues all agree that it’s the most “realistic” doctor tv show.. so it’s helped me kinda understand his world a little better.
The Office (U.S.),They aren't even comparable in my opinion. Scrubs is a classic with rewatability. The office is terrible.
The Office (U.S.),"Scrubs, by a hair though"
The Office (U.S.),Scrubs personally.
The Office (U.S.),Scrubs seems to be more popular in Germany. It was on television all day long. I have never watched The Office tbh.
The Office (U.S.),It's comparing apples to appletini's
The Office (U.S.),Ted and toby should meet.
The Office (U.S.),Head over to Cougar Town for all your Scrubs crossover needs.
The Office (U.S.),"When Pam catches Michael in the parking lot pouring gasoline on the ground, it kills me everytime. "
The Office (U.S.),[deleted]
The Office (U.S.),"To me, season 7 felt like the only one of the later seasons that wasn't a chore to get through. "
The Office (U.S.),"I enjoy a lot of the moments in s7 and s8, but honestly when I rewatch the show I usually decide to just restart it back at s1 when I get about halfway through s7.  The tone changes dramatically and it feels lot more serious and less lighthearted.  s8 has it's moments with Robert California, s9 is just terrible and I can't bring myself to watch it at all.  They butchered Andy's character horribly."
The Office (U.S.),I loved season 7 it was my favorite.
The Office (U.S.),I had a boss like Michael Scott. He wants to be loved. Season 7 was the end of Michaels arc anyway. Seemed like a show trying to survive with out him but they couldn't. Scrubs tired the same shit and it failed as well.
The Office (U.S.),"That's one of my favorite seasons and I have no idea why.

Andy in season seven is also my favorite Andy."
The Office (U.S.),"That's funny, Season 7 of the Office is probably my favorite season."
The Office (U.S.),The reason it feels different is because it was the first season that Paul Lieberstein (Toby) was the show runner alone so the humour was more akin to his style. 
The Office (U.S.),"I honestly think season 6 is the weirder season. The worst is 8 (of course) but season 6 is really bad- the only saving grace for that season was Scott's tots if I'm remembering that right. Season 6 just felt like all the story lines were getting stale and uninteresting. Some of the least interesting story lines from the show are from this season (Besides season 8.. of course) Season 7 seemed like it was actually moving forward throughout the season. 

Also if you ever get a chance- on the DVD for season 7 they have the actual entire movie of threat level midnight and it's SOoo amazing. The episode on netflix I think is the one where it cuts back to the people in the office watching. But honestly, the entire Threat Level Midnight is amazing and has so many wonderful subtleties. "
The Office (U.S.),"This moment made me burst out laughing during my first watch:

Dwight: *listing people who have had sex in the office*

Kevin: As has Kevin

Angela: With who? 

Kevin: She goes to another school"
The Office (U.S.),"Hey, you know what? I've got gas all over my hands and my shoes. Would you light it? Would you do the honors please?"
The Office (U.S.),Problem is ... he isn't.
The Office (U.S.),"Season 9 was an improvement from 8 IMO and (aside from Andy, that was terrible) I thought it was a return to form with a great finale "
The Office (U.S.),They really built Andy up to be a new lead but he had to leave to film a Hangover so their plans got screwed up. 
The Office (U.S.),"i didnt like season 7 a whole lot with spader, but i really appreciate it now after watching him in the blacklist."
The Office (U.S.),Everyone boo this man! 
The Office (U.S.),It should also be noted that his ridiculous antics served him very well as a salesman.  Moments where his expert salesman past comes out and impress everyone happen occasionally.  He's just fundamentally unsuited to be a manager.
The Office (U.S.),"Both failed, but the Scrubs situation was completely different than the Office. Season 9 of Scrubs featured a completely new starting cast and felt more like a spin-off. The Office, on the other hand, only replaced the main character and almost everything else remained the same."
The Office (U.S.),Yes! You know. And Mindy Kaling and BJ Novak also left. They were writers as well as actors on the show. The showrunner also changed as well.
The Office (U.S.),"I thought 6 was still in the same vein of tone as the previous seasons even if some of the stories were getting stale. Kinda of the same thing happened with Cheers in which I believe its season 7 stories started being noticeably different. 

I am enjoying the Angela and Darryl character development in season 7"
The Office (U.S.),"I agree. The Sabre storyline along with the additions of Gabe and Jo 👎. They tried to do something different but it just didn't work.

The Office (U.S.),"It was better than season 8's attempt at adding Jim and Pam drama (Pam thinks Jim is cheating on her after a series of misunderstandings and poor communication?)

The only show that comes close for me is Parks & Rec. Similar style I guess, with every character lovable in their own way. "

I wonder how they felt while they read the final one. I've never known of a show that could make me love every single character. I've rewatched this show over and over again. When it ended I felt like a huge chapter of my life ended. This show was on for years and it literally made me worst days better. My happy days even happier.

The Office (U.S.),"I like rewatching random episodes from time to time too. There was one in the 8th season that really stood out to me in terms of how much the characters had grown and the contrast between the early season version of themselves. It was at the very start of the episode and I think some of the guys had found a dog locked in a car in the parking lot. 

What was cool was Dwight, jim and a couple others had just returned from grabbing some iced coffees or something at the moment the other guys had found the car. It likely wasn't meant to be anything but just seeing jim and dwight and the two others being friends and taking a break together was really pleasant and satisfying to watch. It is easily my favourite non-moment moment in the whole series. "

The Office (U.S.),"Someone on YouTube thought it was a bit of a mess, with too much build up for the payoff. I kind of have to agree, especially considering how many other scenes had to be cut for the episode."
The Office (U.S.),Either that or they just cut his scene (and redistributed one line to Creed) so that no one in the room would leak Carrel's appearance.
The Office (U.S.),"I don't believe so. I saw that Rainn is in costume as Dwight, but I think that's a personal choice on his part. Also, there were a lot of changes between this read and shooting, so I think some time passed between them."
The Office (U.S.),"Just for clarity, the UK series was 12 episodes long with two additional 45 minute specials. Also the UK and US versions of the show are essentially two completely different shows once you get past the pilots so there's really no use comparing them.

Heroes,"You don't feel that way in the game because you've been mowing enemies for the past 16 hours of playtime by then. You're desensitized to the violence by that point.

What makes love stories interesting is the individuals involved and their growth within the story. 

Murder is bad? Yes. This is a shit story. Violence begets violence? Yes, this is a base level concept that many stories use but builder deeper themes and characters on top to become great. TLOU2 is basic shit."

Heroes,Joel is absolutely the bad guy in this situation. We understand and feel for him cause we are watching his perspective but if we watched an entirely different character up until they are brutally murdered by this stranger Joel at the hospital we’d absolutely look at him as the villain. He made a selfish (understandably) choice.
Heroes,"I'm not sure I understand the distinction you're making. I'd say The Last of Us 1&2 absolutely acknowledge and question the impact of how someone responds to their emotions/instincts, and the alternatives to acting off instinct or emotion. The games (and this first season of the show) are constantly questioning the morality of characters actions, especially when their reasons for acting may be sympathetic or instinctive.

Heroes,"I was taught this quite effectively in GCSE English in the 90s. We read a piece of prose about a military officer getting chocolate for his daughter on his way home from work during a terrible war in winter.

It was a wholesome, but boring, story.

After we'd finished reading it the teacher asked us what the ""snow"" could be. It was worded in such a way it wasn't obvious. Then they explained - he's on his way home from the Concentration Camps. The ""snow"" was the ash of corpses he'd ordered be burnt.

The story and it's allusions suddenly made MUCH more sense. It was a 'wholesome' story but with one hell of a fucking kick.

We were all stunned. This guy who we'd all decided was a wholesome dad going about his day and getting his sweet daugther a chocolate bar during this terrible war. Turned out to be a fucking Nazi Deathcamp leader.

It was a real eye opener and has stayed with me for 25 years."
Heroes,[Big ol' spoilers for The Last of Us Part 2.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf-nQUiD6_g&t=333s&ab_channel=Wisecrack)
Heroes,The game's fanbase has been arguing about it for 10 years now.  Is there a particular reason you think the show will be any different?
Heroes,"I thought Joel was straight-up evil in the finale, but you don’t think his actions were “negative?!”"
Heroes,">Nobody watching is going to be unsympathetic to the calls made by the characters here

Yes, that's called protagonist bias and some of the most interesting media being made lately is about confronting that and recognizing that other perspectives outside the one presented to you as the most sympathetic are just as valid. 

It's always interesting to me how many struggle with that while being simultaneously angry that the media confronting that... is about that. ""Why are they trying to tell me violence and revenge are bad?"" They shout as they miss the point entirely and defend Joel as if those he's murdered don't have equally valid lives and families.

That's not to say that those who want a shallow reading or story of good guys v. bad guys are wrong for wanting that but it does feel weird to be angry at the story for digging deeper.

EDIT: You deleted your reply so I'll leave my response here: 

>to possibly save a bunch of people who are essentially abstract concepts

But this again misses the point of protagonist bias.

You are asking the narrative to spoonfeed why someone should care about faceless people when the point is that you should care regardless.

The value of the cure is in its possibility, not its certainty. Life doesn't have value because you are told how and why those lives are sympathetic."
Heroes,"Highly disagree, >!there was an actual plan for the cure this time!< so fuck him and what he did"
Heroes,I’m sorry I don’t understand what you’re saying. Can you explain this to me again while not sounding like a psychopath?
Heroes,"It’s honestly so similar that it’s hard not to. 

Same thing happens with book adaptions except most people on reddit play games more than they read books. 

The last of us hbo subreddit has a show or game spoilers thread though if you want to be able to discuss in peace.

/r/thelastofusHBOseries"
Heroes,"For those who have played the second game, it’s next to impossible to even discuss the finale and what might be next with those who don’t know the story.

Given their context and details, the spoilers are nearly unavoidable. Easier to simply say nothing than even try to be vague or play dumb—which is it’s own kind of frustrating for fans wanting to talk about it.

Not sure how people will go in Season 2 without knowing some of the bigger plot points.

Though, if you do, props to you. It will be quite the feat."
Heroes,"They follow the game story dot for dot when making this story which isv extremely rare. It means you can actually join in the conversation with the players too. After all, the show is made for people who didn't play the game and that's pretty neat because now we're both enjoying the content. That being said .. I love 2 way more than 1 so buckle up!"
Heroes,"You know, having ADHD isn’t always great, but I forget things so easily I basically can’t be spoiled. 

That being said, so far as I’m aware, studies have shown spoilers don’t diminish the enjoyment of a piece of media."

Heroes,...they do have show only threads
Heroes,Rekt
Heroes,"I think it can easily be the morally right thing to do.

Murdering people who are already incapacitated is not morally right to me. killing the doctor is not a morally right thing either.

But I wouldn’t sacrifice a child to save humanity who has adapted to the new world order.

I would allow her to sacrifice herself though. That’s the other thing Joel is guilty of, but so are the fireflies."
Heroes,There are plenty of ethical arguments that what the Fireflies tried to do is horrible. Not saying its some settled debate but wouldn’t be surprised if other people with medical training wouldn’t be appalled by the operation itself and the way it was handled.
Heroes,"It's the cost of love. As a parent, I would do **anything** to protect my children. The love a parent has for their kids is so primal. I didn't understand until my first child was born. Something just switches in people."
Heroes,"No, what’s selfish is asking someone to sacrifice their “family” member just so your bloodline can continue"
Heroes,The game made it more of a “it’s you or me” situation. The show presented it as him mowing down crowd’s without resistance.
Heroes,"Right but you are killing them in your mindset and my mindset was completing the game. As you said, a function of the game is plowing down henchmen albeit with limited resources.

In the show, we get a stronger notion of how unhinged/determined Joel is when it comes to protecting Ellie. We also get a distinction on who it is he’s killing.

I don’t recall a point in the game where someone is sincerely begging for mercy and incapacitated. When they begged then it was either a cutscene or a ruse iirc. 

The weight of it just feels heavier watching it for me."
Heroes,"I would say, to amend Mazin’s statement, good stories are built around tension, and that can come in the form of inter-character tension, like tlou, or intra-character tension, like lotr."
Heroes,"Yea that seems like a nothing statement to me. It basically amounts to ""can you turn the themes of your stories and internal struggles of your characters into marketable taglines catered to people who engage with media on a surface level"".

Cause ""It's worth killing everyone to save the person you love"" is the absolute shallow end. It's what conservative preppers dream about when they buy guns."
Heroes,"Well, there was also the “destroy evil on middle-earth” part too haha but yes I agree."
Heroes,">I wish more people actually debated this right here instead of all the excuses about how what Joel did ""isn't actually that bad""

Lol, that is the debate. You feel differently than those people. You sound like you're just wishing everyone agrees with you tbh

This type of story is going to fracture opinions and split ideals. Some people will justify each action Joel made, not realizing it, seeing the lines he is crossing. Others will be horrified and want him to stop. Some will be cheering him on like he is dad of the year, and others will never look at him the same way.

It's a complicated story that has a ton of varied responses from viewers. That's it's strength imo"
Heroes,Isn't Druckmann listed as the only writer for the first game?
Heroes,neil is the sole credited writer for the first game
Heroes,"I loved it. It's refreshing to see the thought process of the creators. Not everyone's cup of tea I guess, but I don't see how he's more pretentious than anyone else deeply connected to a story would be."
Heroes,"Everyone in that hospital was actively conspiring to murder Ellie.  They weren't exactly innocent themselves.

Joel wasn't necessarily ""right"" but it's meant to be ambiguous and I do not understand why people act like it's black and white."
Heroes,">The game's fanbase has been arguing about it for 10 years now.

Eh. Ish. Like, people talk about it being morally complicated, but... it's not, really, it's more a bit of spice in the characters. Would anyone ever believe Joel might choose differently? People see it as something that humanises him far, far more likely than they see him as a monster for it. Would people have actually preferred he let shit play out otherwise? I doubt it.

And even if we go with the now clearer idea the cure would work, for example, how much of a difference that would make to this world isn't exactly clear cut. In making such a big deal of the human factional conflict and inevitable grimdarkness of everything in this world, and minimising the gameplay sections (ie the bits where we actually see how dangerous the infected are), the show has made the fungus a secondary problem, so the supposed stakes don't quite stand up. If everybody got immunised tomorrow, it would change very little for a long time."
Heroes,"I mean idk.. taking so many lives like he did definitely is bad but am I crazy for feeling like he was justified in doing so? I'm not saying it was right what he did or moral but I wouldn't go as far as to say that it was pure evil. They attack him and Ellie(loves her like a daughter) with stun grenades, knock him out with a rifle, say they are killing his daughter without her consent for a chance at a cure that might not even work and if he tries to go to her they will kill him. Everyone he kills minus the 1 doctor has ARs and are actively trying to kill him to stop him from getting to Ellie. Killing the lead surgeon who was defenseless was the only real issue I had with what he did. That and obviously lying about what happened to Ellie. Marlene would have eventually come after Ellie and was pointing a gun at Joel threatening his life.

If he had left and nothing positive came out of Ellie's murder(yes that's what it would have been) it would have haunted him to his deathbed and completely destroyed him that he didn't save her when he could have just like he didn't save his own daughter. I really believe the situation would have gone completely differently had the doctors given Ellie the choice and let her help Joel understand that this is what she wanted. He would have had closure and Ellie would have had agency over her decision. That and trying other alternatives before moving to something so drastic"
Heroes,There’s nothing evil about saving a little girl from being murdered. Joel did nothing wrong.
Heroes,"TIL defending your children is considered evil.

There’s a saying that eludes me right now, but it’s something like any parent would rather let the world burn than lose their child."
Heroes,"While I don’t think killing people is a thing I could do, I would never allow the use of a kid in the way they did either.

In the game the killing is far easier then actually seeing it in the drama though. 

Still there is no question in my mind that fireflies were wrong unless they specifically asked Ellie which they did not."
Heroes,Need a cure for the 2 groups of infected he ran into throughout a cross country expedition?
Heroes,It's more that people just outright post spoilers
Heroes,Are you sure it followed the game dot for dot??
Heroes,I hate spoilers. It takes the excitement and surprise out of watching a show.
Heroes,Then why is everyone bitching about spoilers?
Heroes,"I think it's fascinating because Ellie makes it pretty abundantly clear that given the choice, she would absolutely sacrifice herself and Joel knew that. To me, it's even doubly selfish that he *knows* what path she would choose and he took that choice away from her. And he *knows* what he did was wrong, otherwise he wouldnt have lied to her. Joel is a broken selfish man and it's engaging as fuck."
Heroes,"I feel like they knew they were going about this the wrong way too. By sedating her and immediately going for the surgery, they purposely robbed her of the choice so she couldn't say no, so they wouldn't have to put down a screaming child. That's absolutely monstrous, even if the outcome was a positive for humanity."
Heroes,"> But I wouldn’t sacrifice a child to save humanity who has adapted to the new world order.

I think that's an incredibly naive thing to say since you haven't lived through an apocalypse. Would people who think it's normal to see their loved ones killed by infected feel the same way as people who post on reddit from the safety of their own homes?"
Heroes,It's one thing if they were 100% sure they could make a cure out of killing her. But they seemed more desperate and clinging to the last illusion of hope they have. There is also the fact that the fireflies won't give the cure for free and will use it to gain power and replace the government.
Heroes,It’s more than just the bloodline of the ff it’s all bloodlines potentially
Heroes,You mean like mankind has been doing for millions of years with war? Hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians are offering their children up right now to try and preserve the tribe.
Heroes,"Most of the people he killed had assault rifles and were actively trying to kill him.  The only really ""unjustifable"" kill, at least onscreen, was the guy who tried to put down his gun."
Heroes,Retcon
Heroes,100% agree. They did great with that. Humanizing the enemy. It was impactful with the kid that Ellie paralyzed and Joel killed. Having him beg for his life and call out for his mom was brutal.
Heroes,"Yeah, and I don't mean to be overly-critical. I'm not a writer and I didn't study it, and sometimes these quotes are taken out of context."
Heroes,"> Lol, that is the debate.

No, it's a different debate. Instead of asking if it's morally right for Joel to doom the world to protect his family, instead the debate is switched to ""Joel was actually saving the world"" or ""Joel knew the cure wouldn't work!""

Stuff like ""the Fireflies mishandled the whole situation"" falls under the original debate. Things like ""Well the cure wasn't likely anyway"" is moving away from the original debate to just flat out saying murder is okay because the cure would fail"
Heroes,"Yes.

Game Director: Bruce Straley

Creative Director: Neil Druckmann

Written By: Neil Druckmann

https://www.mobygames.com/game/60922/the-last-of-us/credits/ps3/"
Heroes,"If you go by the game credits, Neil was in charge of the story and is credited as creative director and Written By, and Bruce Straley handled the gameplay side. If you go by what people online say, Bruce reigned in some of Neil's narrative choices to improve it to the story we wound up with in the final product. 

Where the truth lays? I don't know. But yes, Neil is credited as the sole creative contributor.

Edit - Not sure what I said to upset people; the credits are what they are."
Heroes,Glad you enjoyed it. Guess I just have a different perspective working in the film industry with these types. Wish we had heard more from the other co-creator who actually made the game.
Heroes,"No one’s acting like it’s black and white and being a bad or good guy is completely subjective. In the story that’s being told here Joel essentially took away the chance to have “literally” saved humanity because he couldn’t handle losing Ellie. His actions are absolutely understandable but he still fucked over others to have his way. The hospital/fireflies weren’t conspiring to murder Ellie, what a dumb and absolutely ridiculous way to phrase them trying to make a cure that could save mankind. Putting aside whether it would work or the logistics of it the point is they had noble means and Joel is the opposite. His actions were selfish and could have ultimately doomed the world. It’s not black and white but he’s absolutely “narrative term here” the bad guy in this situation and even by saying that I understand his motivations and actions. You can still root for and respect the bad guys actions. It’s not at all ambiguous, it’s a moral debate. I don’t think you understand the term ambiguous."
Heroes,Why the downvotes?
Heroes,"> Would anyone ever believe Joel might choose differently?  

That's not the question posed, it's whether Joel was justified in his actions or was he completely and unwaveringly selfish or even both. You're not supposed to question whether he should've made a different decision (I don't think he ever would and that's why in the game you aren't given the choice) but question whether he is justified in his actions (which I do not)."
Heroes,"I don't have much sympathy for the Fireflies at all for the reasons you give, but also because I have zero confidence in them to actual accomplish anything. They are NOT a competent resistance group, the Fireflies and I have no faith in their ability to generate a cure. Even if they managed to, how would they distribute it?

Killing the surgeon was easily the most questionable thing Joel did (and certainly will come back to haunt him depending how close they follow the second game in the future), but frankly, the surgeon was something of a dumbass. I was laughing at the guy when he was put down.

""How did you get in here?""

He just did a John Wick and slaughtered all your mooks. Did you not hear the gunfire?

""I won't let you take her!""

Again, he just took down a dozen guys and is here with a gun. You're giving his daughter to him or...oh, never mind, he just shot you."
Heroes,"I gotta agree, have you ever seen anything about a game called Lisa: The Painful? Similar premise, but I feel it does a better job with the toxic love question. While also giving the daughter character agency to maker her own choices"
Heroes,"he only slaughtered countless men, including several that were trying to surrender and pleading for their live. He shot the doctor in the head without flinching, when he didnt have to. He shot and killed Marlene, who was also actively trying to reason with him. 

""nothing wrong"" lol"
Heroes,"You're insane if you really think that 

Like I get rationalizing Joel's act because you love Joel but saying he did NOTHING wrong at all is just outright evil shit."
Heroes,And he robbed countless of lives from being saved and cured with a vaccine.
Heroes,"Evil is a strong word, but everyone is the hero of their own story and the villain in someone else's. Loads of people aren't going to give a shit how much Joel loves Ellie (who they would happily point out is not actually 'his'), while their own children and millions of others are dying. To them he is the bad guy. Maybe even evil."
Heroes,"People think crossing an arbitrary border to save your child's life is evil, why the surprise here?"
Heroes,That's not his child!
Homeland,"S3 is definitely weaker and ridiculous when it comes to Carrie and Brody story. You could just read spoilers or episode descriptions of s3 and skip to Watching S4 upwards. S4 is great. Takes place in Pakistan with Carrie being the „drone queen“. S5 she is in Germany. Peter Quinn is amazing throughout the entire series.

I love homeland. It never let me down after s3. It remained tremendously entertaining"
Homeland,"Season 2 gets a bad rap, but the first half of Season 2 is like one of the best runs of 5 episodes in a row i've ever seen.  You should probably just stop watching, but my favorite seasons are 4 and 5.  One of the main criticisms was that the show wasn't real enough, or ""this would never happen"", which of course not it's fiction.  Definitely in its later years Homeland leans more action-oriented."
Homeland,Carrie fucks every bad guy in the show lol. I fucking love Homeland to death but it is a very imperfect show.
Homeland,"This is a hard one. 

Homeland is like two different shows. There’s the first three seasons that are like one arc. 

And then there’s the rest of the show which basically reinvents itself each season after. Season 3 is the worst, and the rest after are all better with a couple as good, in my opinion, as season 1. 

But if your problem is Carry’s behavior specifically, no, she doesn’t get any less erratic when she’s having an episode, which feels like a couple episodes each season cover. 

She, of course, isn’t always “having an episode”. 

Carry is Carry. She never, like, overcomes her bipolar or whatever. That isn’t her character arc."
Homeland,"It doesn't get any more coherent, I'm sad to say."
Homeland,It’s not real life if you don’t like the characters just stop imo
Homeland,[deleted]
Homeland,I thought it was great until the ends of Season 1. I kept watching for a bit after that and I think it was somewhere in Season 3 that I stopped. Just stopped caring for the most part and Carrie was insufferable.
Homeland,Goes off the rails after Season 1 and I never finished Season 2.
Homeland,"seems like Carrie is your problem, so perhaps it's best to abandon the show since she's in to the last scene (and beyond). Personally loved the show until the end, final season may very well be my favourite of the whole run"
Homeland,I way preferred late era homeland to the first 3 seasons
Homeland,The season with the female president was sad.
Homeland,"Hm, maybe I'll stick it out then if I can stomach the rest of s3."
Homeland,"I get that it's fiction, but if you're going to base your fiction around the real world then it should follow the real world's rules.  And rule #1 is people who lie about their mental illness for more than a decade to keep their security clearance will have it revoked so fast it'll make their head spin and not be let within a hundred feet of the building anymore, if they're not just arrested."
Homeland,Seriously?  Ugh.
Homeland,"I get that she's bipolar and have no issue with that part (other than in early season 3 where she basically uses it as a way to build a cover story as a disgruntled ex-CIA agent, that was dumb because who in the world is going to trust what a crazy person has to say?), I even get that it's not something one ever really gets over.  But my issue is that even when she's on her meds she's erratic as hell and constantly endangering her own life and the lives of others with her antics.  The only reason she doesn't get herself or others killed is either plot armor or insane luck and there's no way an agency like the CIA would continue to employ someone like that even if she is really good at her job, not even considering the security clearance issue."
Homeland,"Well that sucks, but at least you've saved me some frustration.  Seems like an interesting premise, I can't help but imagine how much it could've accomplished if it had quality writers who didn't follow the Lost method of cooking up bullshit just to drive 'drama'."
Homeland,"I do though - if I hated the show I wouldn't need a reddit post to tell me to stop watching it, lol.  Just some stuff really bothers me."
Homeland,"That sounds interesting, I'll check it out thanks!"
Homeland,"Same, season 1 was pretty good, but after that.. meh."
Homeland,You’re missing out on some amazing espionage tv in the later seasons
Homeland,It's not so much her (though the 'woops I went off my meds again!' thing is wearing real thin) as the fact that there's not a chance in hell the CIA would have anything to do with her after it came out that she lied about having bipolar disorder so every time she just gets let back in like it's nothing it grates.
Homeland,Yeah looking back s3 is really ridiculous how they resolved the whole Brody storyline. It’s definitely something you have to forget/blend out for future seasons..that Carrie was on national television or for some kind of congressional hearings…and then goes back to be a cia analyst or undercover spy again :D
Homeland,Her mental illness is used as a plot device practically every season so it won’t get any better for you lol.  Claire Danes slays it every time though.
Homeland,"Sure, Carrie nails every bad guy in the show...but what about the guy who kills bad guys!?  WHY DIDN'T SHE NAIL HIM for the love of something"
Homeland,I stuck it out till the end of Damian Lewis's tenure specifically b/c of Damian Lewis. I had hoped they'd find a good replacement story/character but they didn't and I didn't last too long after that.
Homeland,How do you watch any show if you can’t suspend disbelief it’s just entertainment.
Homeland,"Right, after trying to leak classified information to a reporter to boot.  I guess the justification (which is pretty fucking thin) is that it was all an attempt to set up a cover to attract the interest of nefarious people who would pay for that kind of information?"
Homeland,Ugh.  'Carrie went off her meds again lol' got old by the 2nd time she did it.
Homeland,Yeah I'm thinking about sticking it out to the end of S3 and if his character hasn't done something more useful than being stuck somewhere that does nothing to drive the story forward then I think I'm done.
Homeland,That's my problem - it's gotten ridiculous enough that I'm having a hard time suspending disbelief.
Homeland,In the later seasons I never found it to drag or become a slog... Rupert Friend's character arc was amazing.
Homeland,"Season 1 is great, 2 is ok, 3 is rough, 4 is okay and then the rest gets pretty damn solid.

If you want a long running show and feel like you’ve run out of options, you can do worse. Feel free to make S3 a background show."
Homeland,Yes.  Middle isn’t great but still good and the beginning and end really is great.
Homeland,Yes. I’ve watched all seasons and they end it in the best way possible. It will be a great journey for you.
Homeland,Yes! The later seasons are still solid imo
Homeland,All shows decline over years but I stuck with it and loved it.
Homeland,"It starts pretty strong, drops a little in the middle and than finishes strong. It has a decent ending too.

I recently rewatched the entire series and enjoyed it more the second time. I watched it weekly the first time and binged it this time. I think it works better when binging. I didn't notice as deep of a drop in the middle this time either.

I won't give any spoilers but some of the subplots didn't do much for me. But they weren't as noticeable when binging, if that makes sense. When there are a couple of episodes that deal a lot with a subplot you don't like, it really drags when you're also waiting a week between episodes."
Homeland,Recently binged the whole series. You’ll get sucked in pretty quick. It gets a little played out towards the late middle seasons but overall it’s worth your time. No regrets and quite enjoyable.
Homeland,"Nah, still worth watching"
Homeland,"Nah, it's pretty solid all the way. Haters gonna hate, is all."
Homeland,"no, it doesn't decline. It actually gets better, and final season is amazing. The only point I'd call weak is the transition halfway through season 3 because that's where the show changes and becomes something else, not the easiest scenario for a writer"
Homeland,"IMHO, yes.  I think a lot of folks think it gets worse after one of the main characters departs but I disagree."
Homeland,It's one of those rare shows that dips but comes back stronger than ever in the final few seasons. Rupert Friend was amazing in the later episodes.
Homeland,Absolutely. Homeland is one of my all time favorite series. There are rough episodes and weaker seasons but its still hugely entertaining and pays off if you stick with it and the final season is fantastic. Claire Danes and Mandy Patinkin deliver some of the best performances you’ll ever see.
Homeland,A resound yes if you're into the spy/suspense/drama type of show. I also highly disagree that it declines.
Homeland,"It always struck me as very propagandistic, like *24*. Can someone who knows tell me if this is the case?"
Homeland,No. It's full of fat naked people.
Homeland,No. Claire Danes ruins it. Such a dreadful dreadful actress.
Homeland,[deleted]
Homeland,"Season 1 is great, season 2 is good, season 3 is half boring half good, season 4 is great and the rest is pretty good. It’s worth watching. The lowest point is probably season 3."
Homeland,I can only speak to the first 3 seasons - it was pretty good with some excellent actors.
Homeland,It’s one of the best shows ever
Homeland,I have literally only seen the first four seasons. Something happened in Season four that made me mad lol.
Homeland,Didn't Mandy do what he always does and demand a massive raise and end up written off?
Homeland,"The first season sort of is in the beginning but by the end of that 1st season it really uses Americas “problems” as plot, so sort of an anti 24 if that makes sense. Should we drone bomb a terrorist if there’s civilians near, should politics come before honesty that sort of thing"
Homeland,"I thought it was fine. In fact, a lot of the negative comments in season 5 came from conservative leaning viewers."
Homeland,"The final season, with the cutesy, nerdy soldier boys, was the rawest propaganda I've ever seen. It was absurd."
Homeland,We must have been watching a different show. Five best actress nominations and 3 wins.
Homeland,"Hahah, no he was on till Saul gone."
Homeland,No. But he is the soul of the show.
Homeland,No he's on the show until the end.
Homeland,edit: dumb politics
Homeland,Yes for the character that is Peter Quinn
Homeland,"S1s best. S2 and 3 are lowest points. 

S4+ Basically becomes Law & Order: Insert City Here but, like, about terrorists, in some foreign city. Its actually quite entertaining, but I would not say good"
Homeland,"Yes it does. Without any spoilers, the Brody topic moves on, and it gets a lot better again."
Homeland,"It circles the drain a little around the midpoint, but manages to find a few interesting story beats and plots here or there all culminating in a really excellent ending."
Homeland,"season 3 is the worst, show rebounds rather spectacularly and it has a banger of a final season, which may very well be the best. It had to ditch Brody 

but Damien Lewis's a terrible actor? No, just no"
Homeland,Season 3 was my least favourite. Season 4 is considered one of the best amongst fans. I thought the entire run was really good and I actually thought the final season was one of the best of the second half of the series.
Homeland,"Season 3 is where I checked out, but I heard it does rebound and get better."
Homeland,"The show drastically changes several times after this, mostly for the better IMO. S1 is a GOAT season of television, S2 and 3 do that Showtime thing of really dragging a great premise that should have just ended early through the mud, but somehow the show perceivers and reinvents itself. Not every season after this is great but I really like 4, 6 and 7 and 8 ends in a good place.

That being said I Damian Lewis is a great actor although, sure, that character completely ran out of steam by the point you're at."
Homeland,S.1 is excellent but it seems like they had no idea there was going to be a S.2 or S.3. The latter feel very thrown-together and border on incoherent at times. Didn't bother after that.
Homeland,"Season 3 is the worst of the show. 

Season 4 is a slow burn but pays off by the 2nd to last episode of the season. The season finale is terrible.

1,2,4,8 are the best seasons."
Homeland,No. Just watch the original Israeli series Prisoners of War. It's a complete story which wraps up nicely.
Homeland,[deleted]
Homeland,I never really liked the show
Homeland,"4 season is better than 3, and 5 is better than 4. In my opinion, it got much better once Damian Brody was done."
Homeland,"Haha these comments are fun. I dropped the series at the same point. 

Maybe when I regain patience I will pick it up again."
Homeland,Yes
Homeland,"4 is excellent, maybe the best or second best season. I thought 5 was fine but it did not really do much more than just be entertaining. 6 was quite surprising. It slowed down and focused on a specific character. Season 7 was also fine, probably better than 5 I think. Season 8 was really intense again, even though they sacrificed some realism but I don't think it bothered me. Season 3 is easily the worst, although it improves quite a bit towards the end."
Homeland,"Yes. It has its ups and downs, but it has been one of my favorite series, and Carrie Mathison one of favorite TV characters, annoying flaws and all. It was bittersweet going into the last season knowing that was the end of the ride. I miss the excitement of knowing a new season is starting right around this time of year."
Homeland,It started off good then became cyclical and I dropped out after season 4. It just starts to become a bit repetitive and soapy...
Homeland,"When the premise of the show is gone, it gets better: Great endorsement"
Homeland,He was abysmal in the Caracas episode season 3 I just watched. Trying to teach the girl English. Comically bad and unbelievable.
Homeland,"What are your top shows. No comedy or romance please. 

Thanks dude"
Homeland,[deleted]
Homeland,"Mad Men, Breaking Bad, Americans are the best TV imo. Recently Severance, Black Bird, and Slow Horses were great. Justified is fun. Went through Peaky Blinders and really enjoyed. Mindhunter top top.

Loved the Bureau, and Fauda was okay, but have never even heard of Babylon Berlin - would you strongly recommend? Thanks so much, this is why I love reddit."
Homeland,"Shameless, Dexter and Weeds were such high points in Showtimes programming, such original and awesome shows. Only issue was they all went too long, but originally they were amazing."
Homeland,"I think the issue is that once everyone dropped cable nobody knew it existed. I just got a year for 99 cents a month, which I took as a sign of desperation."
Homeland,Showtime should just be a “channel” on Paramount+. Similar to how IFC and Shudder are channels on AMC+. I dunno why high paid marketing execs have to make such a mess of things.
Homeland,I will always love showtime because they had the cajones to bring Queer as Folk to an American audience.
Homeland,Homeland was brilliant.
Homeland,Showtime has made a ton of great stuff. A lot of my favorites.
Homeland,"This is certainly yet another sign of the end of the *golden age* of television. We're drifting back to a world where everything is consolidated into a handful of corporate entities (not too unlike the big 3 networks), and where drone-like execs make all the decisions and override anything not mainstream enough."
Homeland,Showtime gave us Twin Peaks S3 which is still the pinnacle of Peak/Golden Age TV.
Homeland,Dexter!
Homeland,Dead Like Me (movie excluded) will always be top-tier television for me.  While I hate that it was canned I am glad it never out out-stayed its welcome.
Homeland,For me it's hard to commit to a Showtime series. Usually start off great but I never want 8 or 9 seasons of anything.
Homeland,"I'm not sure it's a mistake to get rid of the Showtime brand. It's a brand I associate with reaching for greatness, but stopping just short of it."
Homeland,"Too many networks, too many streaming services, too many shows. Anyone else feeling extreme 'media overload' these days?"
Glee,And that's deep left by Castellanos for a home run.
Glee,As a gay man who has watch a lot of Ryan Murphy’s shows: HAHAHAHAHA
Glee,The fig show?
Glee,"""Some"" is just one, according to the article. And it actually angered other execs, once again in the same quote. These two little facts change the entire narrative the title is trying to sell to get a click..."
Glee,"as a gay person: yeah, fair"
Glee,Well it is kinda gay
Glee,Isn’t it crazy how easily you can believe that Fox Executives would do this almost as easily as believing that ryan Murphy would make it up
Glee,"It tracks. Fox told Thomas Dekker he couldn't come out while he was on The Sarah Connor Chronicles. 

There are also several scenes on Glee where you could tell a kiss was scripted but they cut it. There's literally a scene where Brittany and Santana talk about the fact that they're making out but are just nuzzling necks."
Glee,"Slightly off-topic, but I can't think of a long-running show that dropped in quality faster than ""Glee"". The first season was great, but it was unwatchable after that."
Glee,The fog show
Glee,You can't convince me the writers and cast didn't call it that either.
Glee,"""I watch Queer as F*ck""

""That's not the name of the show..."""
Glee,My dad called it that too
Glee,Ryan Murphy is an unbearable hack with a dumpster fire personality.
Glee,"I guess if you wanna be vulgar I could be called that. I couldn't get past the first episode. It ***was*** the show for insufferable people of all genders, ethnicities, orientations, etc."
Glee,"The gleeclub was called ""new directions"" and all I ever heard was ""nude erections"""
Glee,It really was though.
Glee,are we gonna act as if this was a shocking revelation?
Glee,"Yeah, I think we called it something similar in school."
Glee,"Thats messed up, none of the cast members are Harley Davidson bike riders."
Glee,well....guess they know their demographics /s
Glee,I mean…
Glee,Spot on
Glee,"And Execs called The Cat in The Hat ""The Shitty Kitty Movie"""
Glee,Everyone's in here making Glee inside jokes and gay inside jokes and I feel left out.
Glee,Goodness knows what they called The New Normal.
Glee,Glee was my first introduction to the fact that glee kids are fucking annoying
Glee,Sounds about right coming from Fox
Glee,I actually worked on this show and with Kevin Reilly quite a bit. I don't belive this for a second as Fox Networks Group was extremely liberal and inclusive. FYI FNG and Fox News are not the same. Completely different management and culture.
Glee,Thank god Lea Michele will never have to read any of the mean comments about the show here.
Glee,Tbh speaking as someone who is gay… that show is very gay
Glee,But did they make it to nationals?!?
Glee,🤷‍♂️
Glee,"Not gonna lie really enjoyed Glee. 

It was a time I had a lot of young kids around and the change of musical taste before and after *Glee* was a godsend."
Glee,And were they wrong?
Glee,they literally used the word in the show.
Glee,Insert Lebowski meme.
Glee,Accurate
Glee,Sounds accurate...for the time.
Glee,Funny is funny
Glee,"Yeah, well wait till the find out bout “F*g eye for the straight guy”

Edit - only on Bravo"
Glee,"I may be wrong for saying this, but that’s objectively hilarious"
Glee,My gay high school friend also called it that.
Glee,Who cares
Glee,Given how not progressive it was and unrealistic and hyper sexualized I’d bet that Ryan was that exec.
Glee,I mean… so did everyone else.  🤐
Glee,.. And?
Glee,Rude and insensitive. Should have just called it That Fucking Shitty Singing Show.
Glee,[removed]
Glee,[removed]
Glee,"I mean, yeah, but you don't have to say it."
Glee,Is he right?
Glee,"I liked it when the singing was natural in the storyline but lost interest when they became music videos. 

That rhythm section though,  they knew every song in every key."
Glee,"Well, yeah. its a cursed show"
Glee,Remember when Ryan Murphy called Slash stupid because he didn't want GnR on Glee?
Glee,ok
Glee,Loving that people love Ryan so much they’re laughing and shrugging this shit off
Glee,Not surprised
Glee,Insipid would be better name
Glee,Which surprised no one?
Glee,"Huh, I just called it ""[the plagiarism show](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Coulton#Licensing)."""
Glee,They aren’t wrong are they? That goes for all musicals.
Glee,"I had a gay boss who called that show ""too gay"". He never used ""f*g"" to describe it, but he wasn't against using the word to describe other things that were even gayer"
Glee,I mean the show is pretty gay. At least personally don’t know any straight folks who were really into it.
Glee,"I don't know if I believe that, but I do believe Murphy desperately wants people to stop calling him out for exploiting Dahmer's victims/crimes for entertainment value and this is the sort of story that would do that."
Glee,"I don't get it, was his statement inaccurate or surprising? Because I believe it was none of the above."
Glee,Ryan Murphy being the guy who exploits the LGBT community (which I’m a part of) for his continued relationship with Fox.
Glee,Are they wrong I think not
Glee,"Well, they’re not wrong."
Glee,[George Carlin -- Context and Intent](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5epKLBUVtto)
Glee,That show was a curse. 3 or 4 cast members are already dead. And one was a fuckin legit pedophile
Glee,I mean….
Glee,Glee sucked ass.
Glee,"Well the show was terrible, basically took hit songs and made them unlistenable"
Glee,Was it not?
Glee,"As a gay,,, I mean"
Glee,"""someone called glee what everbody who's seen 5 seconds of it calls it."""
Glee,I mean…..
Glee,Well they weren't wrong
Glee,it was a f---ing dumb show
Glee,That’s what everyone knows it as
Glee,"It was a different time, several years ago. :/"
Glee,Not wrong
Glee,Not wrong
Glee,"Oh no. Someone called someone else a name. 


So, anyway....


Having been called many things in my life, both good and bad - some so vile they'd make a lot of folks cry...I learned that these names and those people don't matter. Life goes on and nothing happens, other than someone tried to hurt my feelings. Get over it. Words only have power if you let them. All this blah about hate speech and the associated idiocy is stupid. 

That being said, you know your life is good when you have time to worry about hurt feelings, especially when the comments are made directly to you as an individual."
Glee,And sometimes y!
Glee,I misread the title and at first thought it was saying that there were Fox execs suggesting that that should actually be the name. Way funnier than the truth.
Glee,I called it the autotune show.
Glee,I cannot believe leopards are eating everyone's faces!
Glee,Same
Glee,*ding ding ding*
Glee,Is anyone really surprised by this?
Glee,And he's surprised? Have you seen American Horror Story?
Glee,🤣🤣🤣🤣 oh you're serious 😂
Glee,A rose by any other name would smell as sweet
Glee,"Came from a place of malice, but he was on the right track."
Glee,And who cares.  The show was super gay and lesbian pride based.  Be happy it even aired at all if they where so bigoted
Glee,Let's be honest. Its a gay-oriented show. Thank god we have moved passed these slurs .
Glee,And?
Glee,"Seriously? What’s the point of this? The show came and went, enjoyed more than a fair bit of success and empowered countless teens across the nation (if not farther), yet we’re gonna go back and complain about what some people said behind closed doors? When did an archaeology degree become a requirement of being “woke?” Literally going out and digging shit up to be offended about now."
Modern Family,I'd say Schitt's Creek.  For the Roses at least.  Especially Alexis who starts out as the typical Paris Hilton socialite trope and turns into a really grounded self-assured character.  But even Moria goes from melodramatic screams over everything to behaving like an actual person sometimes in later seasons.
Modern Family,"Community is my all time favorite show, so I say this with love. Those characters were absolutely flanderized.

Winger lampshades it best: they went in one side as real people and came out the other as mixed up cartoons."
Modern Family,The ways in which they failed haliey in the final seasons is so disappointing still
Modern Family,"M\*A\*S\*H did it pretty well, especially with Margaret, Charles and Potter."
Modern Family,"Did we watch the same show? 

The characters were not pigeon holed into those stereotypes but by the end of the show they were all ridiculous caricatures of themselves."
Modern Family,Bojack Horseman did a great job developing characters
Modern Family,"I liked that in ""Ugly Betty"", all the characters are revealed as... people who lean into the stereotype for personal reasons. so: they can still be just as broad or crass as in the show's very beginning, but over time, you understand why they think this is the best way to face the challenges. (but it's set in the fashion industry and it deals a lot with first impressions, so it's both fitting and... kinda trite/obivous)"
Modern Family,"Moral Orel is the most extreme example of this possible. Well, maybe it's somewhat different but it turns complete caricature/stereotype puppets into some of the most emotionally complex characters ever written."
Modern Family,"This is pretty standard stuff though especially for a network tv sitcom.  The characters are drawn pretty broadly at the beginning to get mass appeal, then given time, the writers can add some dimensionality to them."
Modern Family,"Community in general went in such a different direction compared to most regular sitcoms. Love that show.

I think another good one would be Malcolm in the Middle. Most of the main characters delevoped pretty well."
Modern Family,Death in Paradise. Every new detective they introduce arrives as a walking British cliche to exaggerate the culture shock and then they slowly become tolerable.
Modern Family,"Parks and recs was like that

I prefer 30 rock precisely because everyone got more crazy, makes it funnier"
Modern Family,Crazy Ex Girlfriend really did this for me. In fact I’d argue peeling back initial stereotypes was one of the shows major driving factors.
Modern Family,Venture bros is a good example of this.
Modern Family,"A lot of the classics. Taxi, Cheers, and Frasier come to mind as a few of the really good ones."
Modern Family,This is the reason I really enjoyed New Girl
Modern Family,"I think this is true for Phil, Gloria and Jay - Claire kinda stayed the same with just her relationships changing, and i'd say similar for mitchell as a character (not his relationship with cam tho) - the kids all just grew up but I think they did expand on thier personalities very well, they felt fleshed out EXCEPT for manny, he was majorly flanderized and was just super aggravating. Cam was already nuts and just kinda stayed that way"
Modern Family,Parks and Rec did this too imo.
Modern Family,"The Good Place. It's the whole point of the show, actually."
Modern Family,"The golden girls. Went from dumb old lady, horny old lady, old old lady and Dorothy to some really well rounded 3 dimensional characters who are not really that old."
Modern Family,"I think it’s exactly the opposite for Modern Family. They got less interesting and more stereotypical. I ended up hating Mitch and Cam because they became lying mean girls and never changed. Every episode lies, lies, lies. And so catty, unsupportive, and sarcastic towards each other. Just the worst. The kids stayed pretty stupid, nerdy smart, and stupid stupid. Phil is the only one that got better. He started out creepy and ended up the only redeemable character, as he was kind and sweet to everyone and worked on his relationships with his Claire, kids, and FIL. In the last season, the writers must have figured these people must have been nasty enough to finally learn some lessons. So they made Claire a little less rigid, gave the kids more than one note personalities, and Jay more loving but the seasons before was just episode after episode of people who supposedly loved one other being terrible to each other and never learning to be better."
Modern Family,"Honesty, Rick and Morty

All the characters start out very one note and grow a lot over the seasons. 

Rick becomes a little more understanding and selfless. Morty learns confidence and to stand up for himself. Jerry and Beth come into their own individually and in their relationship. Summer does whatever she wants and dgaf"
Modern Family,"I could be wrong, but it sounds like you’re describing almost any successful show I’ve seen on network tv (or streaming too). They all start with pretty clear stereotypical characters for mass appeal (so anyone can quickly identify with one of the characters), but they are able to add layers and subtlety over time.

Your two examples are good starts. Others off the top of my head that fit that description: Fringe, Scrubs, HIMYM, Dexter, Lost, Breaking Bad, The Office, Parks and Rec, Schitts Creek."
Modern Family,I guess sometimes it takes a while for characters to get fleshed out and find their voice. One of the beauties of the 22 episode season is that the writers have more time to develop
Modern Family,Is Modern Family worth watching? I'll see it's airing on a channel a few times & I get curious on whether if it's worth watching or not.
Modern Family,"I felt the total opposite about Community which was what really started killing my interest in the show in later seasons. Every now and then a character would have an episode with a story that breaks them out of their role, but mostly they devolved into caricatures and callbacks."
Modern Family,You mentioned Community but Brita is probably one of the most flandizered character since maybe Flanders….
Modern Family,"I’d say Bob’s Burgers is a good example of this.  The characterization jump from the first season, to that Christmas episode they just did, is crazy.  As the show went on and found its voice as a more understated and (usually) wholesome comedy, the characters were allowed to become *less* exaggerated, and consequently more human and relatable."
Modern Family,"I'm actually not a fan of this.

It made the stereotypical side of the show stand out more when the show became less of a whacky comedy.

And sometimes the character development just didn't go anywhere."
Modern Family,"I feel like Community fleshed their characters more out as it went on. We got to see goofy and emotional sides of Jeff, Britta became funny and wasn't the only voice of reason, Troyer stopped being the average Jack, Abed was always fine"
Modern Family,American dad sort of does this. They develop in their own way and stay mostly true to who they are but they are more of themselves if that makes sense.
Modern Family,"Honestly a lot of decent shows (especially sitcoms) do this. Doesn't seem that rare? The pilot and first few episodes have a lot of archetypes and then they are able to flesh out characters as they build on storylines and there is more content. Parks and Rec, Community, the office, Brooklyn 99, all the shows people fawn over in this sub."
Modern Family,"Not true. Most characters devolved over time. It’s inevitable. The decline is there, but it’s spread out through 11 years. Watch Gloria season one and compare her to later seasons, or Cam who became more camp and played up the stereotypes. 

It was interesting how Cam, played by a straight male, made his character campier each season, while Mitchell, played by a gay male, stayed the same throughout."
Modern Family,"I think you're mostly right about Community, but Britta definitely gets Flanderized (Or Britta'd?) She follows a similar trajectory to Lisa Simpson, who goes from being the smart writer-insert who's usually right about things, to a caricature of whiny, self-righteous progressives. Except while it took around ten seasons for Lisa to devolve, Britta Britta'd early in the first season."
Modern Family,This feels like almost every show
Modern Family,"NYPD Blue - Andy springs to mind. It's hard to say for all characters as there was a lot replacements over the years. 

Andys arc is tremendous though."
Modern Family,"Schitts Creek. The office. Parks and Rec. 30 Rock. That 70s show. 

More or less any show that makes it past three seasons does this."
Modern Family,"You're the Worst has some really moving and meaningful character progress. 

The first season primarily highlights just how the characters are awful to everyone around them. They continue to be awful to everyone around them all the way through the series, but it explores in meaningful and interesting ways WHY they do this, as well as their successes and failures in terms of how they try and grow as people."
Modern Family,All I know is I can't fucking stand Sofia Vergaras voice.
Modern Family,"I honestly hated Modern Family. I liked it at first, but how exactly did these characters change? Haley continued to be a ditz, as did Luke, and Alex became horrifically unlikable and stuck up. I found the adults to be OK. 

Schitt's Creek was so much better."
Modern Family,"Big Bang Theory.  At the beginning they were just a bunch of nerds who didn’t have a social life except for their clique and Penny was a young actress who moved across the hall.  But as the series progresses, the characters grow, get married, Penny at times outsmarts the guys, ends up with a successful career in sales. For example look at the characters of Howard and Sheldon from the start of the series to the end.  

Young Sheldon does too.  Sheldons siblings are depicted as the ones who aren’t smart and at times come across more likable and with more common sense than Sheldon."
Modern Family,Do they? I only tolerated the characters enough to finish the show. Can’t say I *liked* any of them besides Lily
Modern Family,"Their character arcs were amazing. Seriously needs to be studied for future tv writers. I loved that show and how it went from basic family chaos to get viewers hooked into the comedy of it, then getting to see each one develop by the time Luke is ready for college and Gloria had her baby and Cam and Mitchell got to adopt. I’m sad it ended really.

How I Met Your Mother  SORT of had that with Barney. You get to see him kind of become redeemable towards the end after being your stereotypical womanizer, and Robin’s growth after being such a stereotypical flighty party girl but the writers screwed that up. Made me so mad 😂 that’s really all I can think of for series that I stuck through to the end 😂"
Modern Family,"Hated the show. Bad acting and predictable jokes. And all the ""heart"" felt incredibly forced."
Modern Family,~~Most~~ ALL shows are like this. It’s this thing called character development.
Modern Family,"The show is absurd and cheesy. It’s not well-written, sorry. 

A mockumentary style that’s never explained and used solely as a cheap way to talk to the camera or give “looks” in situations. Sure.

You have a dumb dad who makes the money, but the housewife is the smart one. Sure.

A Latina trophy wife married to a 70 year old, but she actually loves him. Sure.

Every absurdly dumb character is white. Sure.

A gay couple where one of them wants to be a football coach. Sure.

I watched the first 2 seasons, and then only watched the series finale. Nothing changed. It’s still dumb.

It’s a shallow show written by trust-fund liberals scared of offending anyone."
Modern Family,[deleted]
Modern Family,The society does this
Modern Family,The original Night Court
Modern Family,"I thought Daria was a great example of this - the artsy friend is more than a standard artsy person, the airhead fashionista sister becomes more intellectual and independent, etc."
Modern Family,See Venture Brothers if you want a great example of Reverse Flanderization.
Modern Family,M*A*S*H
Modern Family,It’s called “the arc in the series.” 🤓😊
Modern Family,I've stopped watching after 6 seasons and I don't know when the characters supposedly became three-dimensional...
Modern Family,"It’s a hallmark of proper character development and good writing. Brooklyn Nine-Nine was one of the best examples of this, even hilariously addressing it in the first episode"
Modern Family,Reversed Flanderization???
Modern Family,M*A*S*H. They all start as kinda stereo types and end up realer people by the end. Especially Margret. Loretta Switt even temporarily left because she did not like the way her character was portrayed and they made a real effort to portray her as a better person.
Modern Family,"Red Dwarf did this - most obviously in the  case of Cat, who in series 1/2 has loads of cat mannerisms which over time get moderated. Rimmer stays neurotic but doesn't get any more so, and lister doesn't become any more of a curry/lager fixated slob.

Personally I loved early season Cat and all the mannerisms and things they had, danny john-jules was just awesome in this role with his background as a dancer and how he'd move on set, his little vocalisms and all the bits of writing, like pulling out the mini iron in a hurry to sort out a crease.But can you imagine if they'd flanderised from here:[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjFItQPBF3E](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjFItQPBF3E)

&#x200B;

(edit: note that I haven't really watched past series 6, idk what happens in the later series as I thought 7 and 8 were terrible)"
Modern Family,Mad Men
Modern Family,"a lot of sitcoms do that, from Frasier to The Jeffersons. I guess it's because these characters need to be introduced to the public as simply as possible and once the hook is firmly in their mouths, they can start evolving them with no fear of losing audience"
Modern Family,Brooklyn 99
Modern Family,"I found Agents of SHIELD to have great character development. From the pilot, I thought I’d be very cliche—Sky was the edgy outsider tech guru, Ward was the tough/popular/love interest, Fitz and Simmons were the overly nerdy comic relief, May was the weathered badass (that stayed true, May kicks ass), and Coulson was the seldom used wiser one who guides every one. But each character develops so much, a ton of new twists are brought in, and there’s a real emotion to many of them. Even new introduced characters have an immense charm (Mac, Enoch, etc) which made this show a ton of fun for those of us that stuck with it through its run."
Modern Family,Bojack Horseman. By the end of the series they really explored the depths of the main characters
Modern Family,"The Venture Brothers has a number of characters that seem like a one off gag (ShoreLeave the gay soldier in the GI Joe knockoff, etc) but who end up being semi major characters and seem to get more depth and reverse Flanderization"
Modern Family,Reboot is doing something similar.
Modern Family,"I'd say this is even more pronounced in reddits' favorite sitcom, Big Bang Theory. 

All characters became more normal (and boring)."
Modern Family,"Honestly very few shows don’t have charachter growth. 

One example that didn’t have charachter growth was Glee. And it was a show that was loved at first and then people got sick of it. And a big part of that was because the charachters didn’t exist as people. They just fitted the storyline."
Modern Family,Just started this show and almost to the end of season one. I think it’s pretty good so far!!
Modern Family,Yeah this show for sure. I hated all the characters at the start but by the end I loved them even with all their foibles
Modern Family,This is why I tell people to stick with Schitt’s Creek even if they don’t like the characters at first. They grow and evolve in surprising and poignant ways
Modern Family,"That was the whole point of that show, though. Showing how being humbled changed them for the better. I'm not into mod fam but it sounds like the writing probably got better as opposed to the characters evolving."
Modern Family,"Is this show actually good? It’s one of those shows that I saw while browsing on Netflix years ago and assumed it was terrible by the looks of it, but I hear *only* good things about it. Is this firmly a “don’t judge a book by its cover” moment, or is it only okay?

Edit: Thank you for the replies everyone! I’ll have to check this one out"
Modern Family,"Schitt's Creek is probably the BEST example of moving away from the stereotypes.  They start out that way so that you know exactly who the characters are and the comedy is in putting them up and contrasting them with ""normal"" small town people.

But what the show does amazingly well is that the characters change over time and slowly we see them start to form bonds with people and grow roots in the town and they slowly start to care about the town.

What I really loved about Modern Family, is that no matter what, it always came back to being about family.  They all ultimately care for and love each other, even though they have their conflicts and differences.  Both shows did a great job of growing their characters."
Modern Family,"yes, but that's kind of the whole plot of the show, for these awful people to slowly become kind, caring and good."
Modern Family,Shame about that balrog in *Moria* tho…
Modern Family,Absolutely.
Modern Family,"Great example. I love the growth of all the characters, especially Stevie and Mr. Rose’s friendship. Oh I adore this show."
Modern Family,"Totally came here to say this!  I hated the characters so much I started and abandoned the show 3 or 4 times.  Finally made myself ""suffer through"" the first season and fell in love."
Modern Family,"David got a lot worse though. Every line just became a variation of ""look at me, I'm gay""."
Modern Family,I would absolutely include Stevie as well.
Modern Family,"Britta was the most different from start to end.  ""You seemed smarter than me when we met."""
Modern Family,"I would say though that they are “reverse Flanderized” by season 6 though, as in undoing the Flanderization that definitely happened. Abed, Chang, Jeff, Annie, and Dean feel like much more realistic, fleshed out, versions of their earlier selves by the end. Britta was reeled back in a little in S6, but not quite back to her S1 characterization, so I guess she’s the exception."
Modern Family,"Yeah, it starts ok but becomes *great* when they're flanderised about halfway through the first season."
Modern Family,It became a bit obvious they didn't know what to do with the kids.
Modern Family,"Hell, if you actually think about it, the finale is one of the most depressing endings ever, completely unintentionally. Just remember what each member of the family sets off to do at the end of the show, then remember this is all happening in early 2020"
Modern Family,I will die mad that she ended up with Dylan
Modern Family,"Frank never became anything other than Frank though. There were moments of episodes where there was a glimmer at the end, but Frank remained basically the same for his entire tenure on the show."
Modern Family,"Potter was always a balanced, reasonable character."
Modern Family,[deleted]
Modern Family,"I'm going to take the wimpy way out of this argument.  You're both right and wrong.

I think the show started as OP said, more stereotypes upon which to hang a sitcom.  As it went on, we saw deeper emotion and characterization of each person, they became fuller people on the show.  

But then it just kept on going, and they reverted, and became caricatures again.  I think they started to run out of decent, thoughtful storylines, and so leaned back on the crutches of the original stereotypes.

That being said, a very well crafted show overall when compared to the vast majority of network sitcoms out there.  It had it's ups and downs, but then you look at something like the Night Court reboot, and you realize how good Modern Family was compared to most stuff."
Modern Family,"Hmm I gotta disagree. Luke and Haley go from being the butt of the joke for how ditzy they are to two characters who show their skills in different ways than Alex - Haley with her social presence and her fashion and Luke with his street smarts and interpersonal skills.
We see Jay go from the curmudgeon dad to a character with lots of deep emotion for his family and Phil as the goofy fun-loving dad to someone with lots of worry and anxiety regarding his family.
The only character I feel like gets more one dimensional is Claire. They really lean into her competitiveness and type-A tendencies"
Modern Family,"Imo, you're both right because OP used the wrong term.

The characters were fairly tried and true tropes at the beginning of the series.

But over time, there was Flanderization with the characters."
Modern Family,100% agree. Mitch and Cam are terrible people and stay terrible to each other. Shows where every joke is at someone else’s expense are the height of lazy.
Modern Family,I agree but they also definitely flanderized Todd's schtick of coasting by on luck/charm to the point where he was inadvertently winning governmental ski race elections.
Modern Family,I love Ugly Betty. Each character has a chance to grow and develop.
Modern Family,I loved watching Ugly Betty back in the day. It was a show that I thought had a lot of heart.
Modern Family,always love to see one of the dozen people on here that remember moral orel
Modern Family,"I wish they shifted that show some so it's not so... ""white person solves crime for island POCs.""

I get that it would shift the show significantly and the gags and lovelorn stuff may ebb (or not). But the optics are bad."
Modern Family,It's weird watching the 30 Rock pilot and seeing how sane Tracy Jordan is.
Modern Family,That show became more and more cartoonish as it went on and I just loved it.
Family Guy,"Death, Taxes, and Fox renewing their big 3 animated shows."
Family Guy,"in 1997 i thought it was wild as to how long the simpson was on.

South Park was still new"
Family Guy,"It's kinda funny. If The Simpsons had actually ended around the end of its ""golden era"" it probably would have been brought back as a reboot by now."
Family Guy,"If you use Simpson premere as a halfway point, it’s equidistant from 1955.  

That was the year that Elvis first appeared on TV, and the year that McDonalds and DisneyLand opened. 

So the Simpson is currently half as old as McD and Disneyland. 


We first landed on the moon *only* 20 years before the Simpson premiered."
Family Guy,The recent resurgence in the quality of the Simpsons has been a pleasant surprise and I'm excited to see more
Family Guy,"Bobs Burgers is one of the best shows ever on TV.

It’s fantastic, the characters are developed, absurd but still realistic. The family is loving and sweet without being cloyingly so.

I may be biased due to the high level of similarities between Bob and family and me and my family."
Family Guy,"I only watch an episode or two of The Simpsons a year, but I’m always happy it gets renewed. I hope they make it to season 40!"
Family Guy,"The Simpsons premiered a couple of weeks after I was born so it’s weirdly comforting having it still going, even though I haven’t watched it in aaaggeesss.

Plus it’s convenient/crazy to think “what season are they up to?” and then just have to remember how old I am."
Family Guy,Roadhouse!
Family Guy,"In other news, the sun rose again this morning"
Family Guy,">  Fox has handed early two-season renewals to three of its animation mainstays – The Simpsons, Family Guy and Bob’s Burgers – taking them through the 2024-25 broadcast cycle.
> 
> The Simpsons will extend its standing as the longest-running scripted series in television history with a renewal for its 35th and 36th seasons. Bob’s Burgers will return for seasons 14 and 15 and Family Guy for its 22nd and 23rd seasons.
> 
> “With this trio of renewals, we celebrate excellence in animation on Fox, our wonderful, long-time partnership with 20th Television and the brilliant creators and incredible voices behind these forever favorites,” said Michael Thorn, President, Scripted Programming for Fox Entertainment. “Three-plus decades of The Simpsons, more than two decades of Family Guy and over a decade of Bob’s Burgers proves the enduring power of the animation genre on our network and the infinite fan affinity for these outrageously funny comedy classics.”"

Family Guy,"“We’ll never stop the Simpsons!

Have no fears, we have stories for years!”"
Family Guy,"The real question, for me anyways, is are they still making Simpsons DvDs and/or Blu-rays?"
Family Guy,Bobbbbby!
Family Guy,Family Guy needs new writers. Last few seasons have been unbearably shit jokes-wise. Simpsons has improved as of late at least.
Family Guy,"Stopped watching The Simpsons regularly around S10. I'm saving the rest for when I'm old as fuck, so I'd better not die suddenly somehow or I'll be pissed off."
Family Guy,I will never be ready to say goodbye to Family Guy...
Family Guy,The Simpsons is now as old as Homer!
Family Guy,"Stop, stop, they're already dead"
Family Guy,My goodness the Simpsons will never end
Family Guy,It's cruel to have kept The Simpsons on it's ventilator this long.
Family Guy,And Bobs Burgers is the only one that’s still funny
Family Guy,Good stuff!
Family Guy,Family Guy is garbage now… at least the Simpsons has had some awesome episodes each season. The Christmas episodes have been fantastic.
Family Guy,The Simpson’s will never Die
Family Guy,They really need to end The Simpsons before one of the major voices dies of old age
Family Guy,"I'm ready to see Family Guy dropped. I stopped watching it years ago. It also hasn't aged that well imo, unlike Futurama, which I think still holds up great."
Family Guy,"Who the hell is still watching The Simpsons?, I checked out at season 12."
Family Guy,"Let em die ffs, we get haha pop culture references we're all aware of. Have any of these shows ever actually been good? Mabye you make an argument for bobs burgers."
Family Guy,Is this Fox a Disney company or is it independent still?
Family Guy,"Bob's Burgers has been around that long? I would have guessed closer to 10... well at least, I would have until I realized the Archer/H Jon Benjamin crossover with it was 10 years ago..."
Family Guy,"Worth pointing out that the numbers in OP's title are the seasons the shows are renewed through. Threw me for a loop for a bit because The Simpsons premiered 9 months before I was born, and I don't turn 33 until August."
Family Guy,LET THEM DIE ALREADY. THEY'RE IN PAIN.
Family Guy,Family Guy and Bob's Burgers is still funny imho. I haven't watched the Simpsons in years so I can't comment on that.

The Simpsons: Out of my way, jerk-ass!"
Family Guy,Them nixing King of Hill probably always haunts them.
Family Guy,"Ah yes, Fox’s One Piece, Naruto and Bleach"
Family Guy,I remember seeing my first Simpsons play at the globe theatre in 1788.
Family Guy,Lol it was not even on that long at that point how you gonna be shocked? Hyperbolic silly comment
Family Guy,"A joke about Homer's youth was that he missed the Moon landing due to him listening to ""Yummy Yummy Yummy"" by Ohio Express instead.


There was a 25 year gap between the episode and the moon landing, and 26 between the episode and the song, so the contemporary equivalent would be Homer missing news of Clinton's impeachment due to him listening to Tubthumping."
Family Guy,Matt Selman has been a godsend.
Family Guy,What season do things turn around? What do you think has improved - is it back to the caliber of early seasons or just better than the last decade?
Family Guy,The most recent Treehouse of Horror was absolutely amazing!
Family Guy,"family guy was pretty good for a while too. i lost track and stopped watching when the pandemic happened though. i dont even know what season i left off on. but it was pretty good most episodes.

Bobs Burgers has always been consistently good. I heard the movie was a bit much though."
Family Guy,"Same with family guy, and bobs burgers has arguably never been better"
Family Guy,Is it good again now?
Family Guy,i might have to give it another chance. I gave up like 25 years ago lol. I was tired of episodes entirely revolving around poorly-voice-acted celebrities and they started leaning into this when they ran out of comedy and fun.
Family Guy,"It’s my favorite adult cartoon that’s still making new episodes for sure. And they still keep it believable. There’s some flanderizarion, sure, but they’re still believable characters in situations that totally could have happened in real life (maybe a few episodes excluded) 

Plus it’s just damn funny"
Family Guy,Season 13's Christmas episode was so good! I watched it many times and still tear up
Family Guy,"I only find myself mildly entertained by Bobs Burgers, but I am very entertained/satisfied to see “cloyingly” in the wild."
Family Guy,"I haven't watched The Simpsons even casually in many years, and yet it brings me an odd comfort knowing it's still on."
Family Guy,"Honestly, I hope the show goes forever. I can't imagine living in a world where The Simpsons isn't airing."
Family Guy,"Yeah I used to be of the opinion that they should kill it off, but at this point I want it to go on forever."
Family Guy,"I wonder if there's a number that the Simpsons team is going for, Ala George Clooney in 'Up in the Air'."
Family Guy,"Recently, somebody on Reddit mentioned that they started getting better around season 20. I put on S20E01, excited to see some “modern” Simpsons, and it was still in standard definition. 

That really dated it for me."
Family Guy,I just read this in peters voice lol
Family Guy,Buttscratcher!
Family Guy,Get off my plane!
Family Guy,It has been renewed for season 4 https://tvseriesfinale.com/tv-show/the-great-north-season-four-has-the-fox-comedy-series-been-cancelled-or-renewed-yet/
Family Guy,"It's been renewed for a fourth, and there are talks about a fifth going on right now. The fifth season renewal will bring the show to 101 episodes."
Family Guy,I need at least one more season. Love that show.
Family Guy,HUP HUP!
Family Guy,I love the “ spinoff “ Chief Wiggum. P.I.
Family Guy,"They stopped at season 20. Family Guy at 19. Bob's Burgers apparently still do, though they're on digital order only. ""Manufactured on demand."" South Park still hits the shelves on DVD and Blu-Ray."
Family Guy,This last season of family guy was a lot better imo
Family Guy,When does Simpsons get good again for you? I defended it to my mates for all the later seasons but then hit end of 32 and start of 33. And just the string of ‘lisa episodes’ got too much and I stopped. Does it turn around after that?
Family Guy,The last few seasons have been very good
Family Guy,Nah.. you will cease to exist
Family Guy,"wait, homer is 33 y/o?"
Family Guy,"Hey, that's not entirely fair. Family Guy was never funny."
Family Guy,I tend to agree. Poor Julie’s voice is getting rough. Marge now sounds like her own mother.
Family Guy,"Right?

Losing Wallace was a bad sign though."
Family Guy,Family guy is more popular than ever. TikTok and YouTube have caused a resurgence in relevance
Family Guy,Are you seriously asking if the Simpsons has ever actually been good?
Family Guy,I like the fact KOTH has a ending
Family Guy,"Doesn't seem like it. They even dropped out of airing the King of the Hill revival. If the show is still production, then it will probably air somewhere else, most likely Hulu/Disney+."
Family Guy,"Considering that 2 of the voice actors died, I'm sure they are actually releaved the show was canceled by the time either passed."
Family Guy,"The Simpsons is obviously one piece. Neither will ever end.
 
Is Bob's Burgers Bleach and Family Guy Naruto?"
Family Guy,"Back then a show would cost a nickel, and in those days, nickels had pictures of bumblebees on 'em. ""Gimme five bees for a quarter,"" you'd say"
Family Guy,"Ah, the middle seasons."
Family Guy,"This reminds me of the play *The Simpsons*, and to a lesser extent the TV series which was also called *The Simpsons*."
Family Guy,">Lol it was not even on that long at that point how you gonna be shocked? Hyperbolic silly comment

At the time it seemed pretty long, most shows would be wrapping up or be wrapped up at that stage.

\>Hyperbolic

How is that hyperbolic?"
Family Guy,He was probably pretty young at the time.
Family Guy,Broti gupta id say
Family Guy,"Not who you asked but it's been funnier the last couple of seasons. I don't watch every episode but still watch it from time to time. The jokes and their timing have been better lately to the point that I'm surprised how much it makes me laugh. They've also gotten better at sliding in subtle jokes that not everyone is going to get which makes it feel more like the golden age of the show. 

That being said the voice cast outside of Nancy Cartwright all sound really rough. That can make it hard to watch at times."
Family Guy,"The notable one for me was the musical that explained to Bart how he can't support a family with a home and 2 cars on a hs diploma like his dad.

It was the Simpsons parodying the very setup of the Simpsons"
Family Guy,">What season do things turn around?

Disney+ launched in 2019; the show has progressively gotten a little better since.

If you're a viewer who couldn't stomach The Simpsons after the Clinton administration, it's probably still going to be ""bad"" to you most weeks. 

It's not going to be the Schwartzwelder Era show again, but it's not plumbing the depths anymore, either."
Family Guy,"It's just overall better, somehow. The stories make more sense, there's more actually funny jokes, hell, the Halloween episode was actually kinda scary.

It's nowhere near as good as it used to be, but much better than the last 10 years."
Family Guy,The current season is the best season in 20 years
Family Guy,The current season (34?) is pretty good! - mind you I'm only a few episodes in.
Family Guy,The show got a new showrunner for the first time since season 13 starting with season 32. I haven't seen all the episodes since then but the ones I have seen have been better than recent years.
Family Guy,HD Era on I think sparked an uptick in my opinion.
Family Guy,People keep saying this so I gave it a try. Don't know what they're talking about. Maybe 1 joke will land. But it's nothing like classic Simpsons.
Family Guy,Also not who you asked but I hear this every year and I watch a few episodes and it seems exactly the same.
Family Guy,I’d say it’s easily the best one in 20 years
Family Guy,"The movie is good, it really just feels like a couple episodes of the show with better animation, and it also made history as one of the first truly hand drawn movies to get a theatrical release in a long time. 


I also agree that Bob's Burgers is great, I always say it's the true successor to classic Simpsons."
Family Guy,"Family Guy has gotten better? I just watched one of the newer episodes. No B-plots, no cutaway gags, too many modern and boring references. It was a slog. The voice acting also felt far worse. I'm curious, what do you think has gotten better?"
Family Guy,"Haha no, they've just reached mediocrity after many years of being downright bad"
Family Guy,"My problem with more recent seasons, ironically, is that it’s had reverse flanderization. Like instead of getting crazier, Louise has softened to a point where she lacks a lot of the bite she had"
White Collar,">Oh, yeah, like I pay taxes

Mozie isn't my favourite, but he has some of the best lines. Love the show, just finished a rewatch last week."
White Collar,"It's not exactly White Collar humour but if you haven't tried Burn Notice, I'd recommend that. Both shows are part of the USA Network's ""Characters Welcome"" universe. [This video should whet your appetite (no spoilers).](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXivFNyfm7U)"
White Collar,I had hopes they'd do a movie with everyone chasing Neal in Paris
White Collar,That show had such great characters and that helped with the humor.  They also did a great job developing relationships and report so they all had such fun interactions.
White Collar,"It was a great show, I was so sad when it ended."
White Collar,"Matt Bomer as Negative Man was a big factor in me giving Doom Patrol a chance (obviously Brendan Fraser was the primary reason) and that motherfucker has made me cry on *numerous* fucking occasions so far without ever even seeing his face.

Love me some White Collar."
White Collar,Then you would probably enjoy Burn Notice as well.
White Collar,"What was so fantastic about Elizabeth and Peter's relationship is they completely avoided the trope of the busy crime-fighting hero with the guilt-tripping wife who is always bugging him to come home for dinner, getting mad when he has to work, and being jealous of his relationships with his colleagues. They were just supportive of each other and the show didn't mine their relationship for cliche drama."
White Collar,Ya he does
White Collar,Go to Wednesday on a Tuesday? Never!
White Collar,Loved that show
White Collar,"Oh, I remember that episode where Peter had to flirt with that lady, and instead of being upset Elizabeth just laughed at him."
White Collar,I hope they do a revival show. Unfortunately the actor who played Mozzie has passed but I think they could use that as a storyline. Mozzie had been murdered and this brings Neal back to the states and teams up with Peter to find the killer.
White Collar,[deleted]
White Collar,I’m in the middle of a rewatch at the moment.
White Collar,One of my all time favorites. Like a mix between “Leverage” and “White Collar”! Love that show.
White Collar,"I just recently started watching Burn Notice and I'm loving it. Super cheesy and not too heavy that I have to pay close attention to every single second. Plus, there's a shitty Dodge Neon driven by Bruce Campbell that gets replaced by a Buick sedan with a fabric roof and promptly destroyed like 6 episodes later. It's a great show to watch if you want something light and super fun. 

I do love how they explained Gabrielle Anwar's accent change from the first episode because her Irish accent in the pilot was pretty terrible."
White Collar,NBC is talking about reviving the show on their streaming service Peacock.
White Collar,That would have been fun.
White Collar,Agreed
White Collar,"Wait, Matt Bomer and Brendan Fraser are in Doom Patrol? Whaaaat? 👀 Definitely giving that a shot next. Thanks!"
White Collar,One of my all time favorite shows. Like a mix between White Collar and Leverage.
White Collar,Ya they had a perfect relationship.
White Collar,Hahaha. Why is it called Wednesday? Because it’s Tuesday!
White Collar,Yesssss
White Collar,They could definitely get around that. I miss Willie Garson. He was one of my favorite character actors. He was such a sweet man.
White Collar,Elizabeth and Mozzie are the best
White Collar,"Burn Notice, White Collar, Leverage were some of my favorite shows growing up (early teens when they originally aired). Crazy to think they first aired 10 plus years ago. Rewatching them is almost nostalgic at this point."
White Collar,Bit late here but if you haven't already you should check out the BBC show Hustle. It's what leverage was based off and it's soooo much better and has some humour like white collar.
White Collar,"I've heard rumors about both a revival or a movie type deal, like with Psych"
White Collar,"Listen, and I mean this with all my heart.

Doom Patrol might be the best show on TV right now.

Also, Timothy Dalton, otherwise known as James Bond and Skinner from Hot Fuzz plays a Professor Xavier type character.  And Alan Tudyk (Wash from Firefly) is the main bad guy AND the narrator.

It’s without question the best show on DC Universe and it just got picked up by HBO Max."
White Collar,"Both are mainly speaking roles, but I started Doom Patrol for the same four\* reasons (+I love Stupidheros)"
White Collar,Bruce Campbell brings a ton of humor to Burn Notice.
White Collar,I have done multiple rewatches of White Collar and Burn Notice. I would of Leverage too if it was available in a better streaming service. I really miss this kind of tv show. I feel like nothing has really scratched my itch recently along these lines.
White Collar,"Totally is. Still love them. Leverage has had me laughing out loud more than any show I have ever seen. Want to hear something cool? They are rebooting Leverage. It will be the first show on IMBD TV. Which is a new streaming service with ads. Unfortunately Timothy Hutton will not be returning, at least not to start. Noah Wyle will be replacing him. But the rest of the cast will he returning. Aldis Hodge, a recurring role, and the rest of the cast as regulars. I’m so excited."
White Collar,Cool! Thanks for the recommendation.
White Collar,I heard those same rumors in a Psych group on FB.
White Collar,I enjoyed Dalton(James Bond) in Chuck as well.
White Collar,"Alan Tudyk is in it? I FELL in love with him in the show “Firefly”. The chemistry between he and Gina Torres was nothing short of incredible. I will never forgive Joss Whedon for killing his character. I am not joking, I hate Joss Whedon because of that. I still have nightmares about it. I will never give up on my conspiracy theory that Whedon did that out of spite, because his show was (unjustly) cancelled. He didn’t even get a heroes send off: just a pole through the chest and eaten by Reavers. I still to this day cannot believe that show was cancelled. 

Alan Tudyk is one of my favorite actors. So is Matt Bomer (CHUCK, White Collar) and obviously I love Brendan Fraser, because he pretty much raised me, at least as far as movies go. I feel like he was in every movie (Mummy, Journey to the Center of the Earth, Crash, Looney Tunes) I went to see when I was younger. You just made my month."
White Collar,"Yeah, I should mention you don’t see either of them very often even though they’re in every episode due to one being a mummy-wrapped character and one being a robot.

But again, the mummy character, with *no facial expressions* has made me cry three separate times."
White Collar,"Have you seen the BBC show Hustle? That should scratch the itch, especially after season 1"
White Collar,"I'm so happy I read this comment.

Thank you, I've always loved Leverage....I seriously missed those characters and always thought there was immense potential for a sequel."
White Collar,"All I remember from Chuck was I liked it, Yvonne is the hottest thing ever and The Man They Call Jayne was awesome every episode. 

And the Old Spice guy showed up."
White Collar,"Wash’s death effected me more than any fictional death ever.

But it’s masterful.

Cause then Zoe gets sliced up the back, Simon gets shot, Kaylee gets poisoned, and River gets locked in with rape-fueled cannibal monsters.

And *because* of Wash, you’re like “FUCK IS HE REALLY GONNA KILL EVERYONE?!”

I have never feared for the lives of fictional characters more in all my years on this earth than the final 20 minutes of that movie, because of Wash.

If you wanna feel like you’re not alone, watch Movies With Mikey’s video about Serenity.  He mentions that a woman in the theater he saw it at had to be dragged out of the theater from screaming and crying so loud.

EDIT: HAPPY CAKE DAY! YOU ARE A LEAF ON THE WIND!"
White Collar,"Also, as much as I love every single character on the show, Brendan Fraser fucking kills it. He says “fuck” probably 78 times an episode and somehow every fuck is funnier than the last.

And Diane Guerrero might be my new all time fictional character crush, giving Bobbie from The Expanse a run for her Martian money."
White Collar,"Not sure if you saw it when you were younger, but Brendan Fraser in 'Monkeybone' is a movie (my nostalgia tells me) I liked."
White Collar,Yes! I love that show. I found it was on Amazon Prime Video recently and did a complete rewatch a couple months ago.
White Collar,Me too so happy
White Collar,"(For some reason) I didn't find blondes attractive until Yvonne Strahovski.

And I loved Jane(Casey)'s uber-patriot. Chuck gets a cheque one episode and Jane says ""If you were a real patriot, you wouldn't cash that"", like he's not even a person anymore, it's great. The scene from the pilot episode where they turn the Nerdherder down a flight of stairs (backwards), while some 'stoner'/skater kids look on and say ""Whoa, computer emergency"" has been burned into my memory since I first saw it. It's a little cheesy and 'nice guys', but also wholesome and classic."
White Collar,Bobbie! Naomi too. 👀
White Collar,Haven’t seen it. Will check it out.
White Collar,"[Monkeybone (imdb)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0166276/)

[Trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8WDX7p9FoE)

Neat, it has Giancarlo Esposito and Bob Odenkirk in it as well."
White Collar,"Damn,
They probably didn’t realize back then that they had an All-Star, loaded cast. I love these types of movies. 

Man, it’s depressing that 2001 was 19 years ago. 🤔🧐😯🤫🥱😒😞😴 Thats okay, the future is there."
White Collar,Mozzie is one of my favourite TV characters. The show has ridiculous charm and I love the focus on more White Collar crimes instead of the typical street level stuff.
White Collar,Part of the golden age of USA network.
White Collar,I really enjoyed the show before losing track of it somewhere around season 3. Like the other USA shows of that time I really liked that it could be serious without ever losing its charm and sense of fun. They don't make a lot of shows like that anymore--everything is always so grim. 
White Collar,"Also it has Tiffani Amber Theissen. 

 "
White Collar,"I really miss this show....you can tell a lot of stories with a show about cons, grifters and FBI

IMPOSTERS is kind of similar, only with a female lead....check it out...its good"
White Collar,RIP Blue Skies-era USA Network 😔
White Collar,"I think it deserved a more wholly covered ending. It's one of my favorite shows. I just feel like the series finale was rushed a bit but for what it was, it was good. 

Edit: typo"
White Collar,I don't think the subsequent seasons were quite as good as the first but they are all worth checking-out. Caffrey and Mozzie are two of my favorite tv characters. Was sad to see it go. 
White Collar,"I get that gritty and dark is in right now, and I love a lot of it, but I honestly don't get how a network hasn't tapped back into that ""Blue Skies"" style that USA used to make these fantastic shows. 

Where's the network with feel good TV? With solid acting, writing and a complete lack of soapy melodrama? Suits S1 & 2, Burn Notice, Psych, White Collar, Covert Affairs, Royal Pains, S1 of Graceland...where are those type of shows at? Sometimes I want some Justified, and sometimes I want some Burn Notice. Sometimes I want an adult alcoholic beverage and sometimes I want chocolate milk. I'd like it if both were available for me to consume. 

But yeah, White Collar is a fantastic show. I think it was the best of them all because it started strong, it had a strong middle and it finished strong. Suits became an SNL skit of itself after S2, Psych is likely second strongest, Burn Notice was great but went a little long and didn't end very strong IMO, Covert Affairs fell apart at the end IMO and throughout the middle some decisions were made that I wasn't really a fan of, and Royal Pains I loved then bailed on by like season 5 or something and haven't caught up since. Oh and Graceland went from solid in S1 to awful in S2 due to their decision to go dark and pump up the soapy writing. "
White Collar,What was your favorite episode?
White Collar,"Check out Suits, it has the same feel to it."
White Collar,"I made the mistake of trying to watch White Collar as soon as I finished Burn Notice, and the formulas for both shows where so similar that I just couldn't get into to it. "
White Collar,I think calling it amazing is a huge oversell but it's enjoyable for sure.
White Collar,White Collar ran itself into the ground by constantly having zero consequences for their actions. I gave up on the show when it was clear they'd never actually get into real trouble. At least Suits actually sent Mike to jail. 
White Collar,I liked it as well.  
White Collar,"The show was amazing but I think it faltered in the final seasons

"
White Collar,"i genuinely missed the characters after finishing the show 
(binged in about 2 or 3 weeks)... they felt like friends"
White Collar,"Is it just me or do USA shows just have a way of... burning out? Everything I've watched I've stopped watching after the first few seasons. White Collar, Covert Affairs, Suits, Graceland (this one really lost its way after the first season), Burn Notice, Royal Pains, Necessary Roughness...

Hopefully Mr. Robot keeps going strong like Psych and Monk did. I thought Sirens was incredibly funny too so sort of sad to see it cancelled. Dig (cancelled), Colony, Shooter – jury's still out."
White Collar,Favourite show ❤️
White Collar,"I loved watching white collar... till it quickly became evident that the basic plot of EVERY season was exactly the same, just had a different main bad guy. The characters developed at snails pace and would often backtrack on any development they made all of a sudden to reloop the basic plot again. Maybe it finally picked up with its last seasons, but I couldn't stick with it after 3 seasons of essentially the same character plotlines. Cast is amazing though and is probably what kept me watching for as long as I did, probably has one of the best TV cast lineups. Especially Mozzie/Willie Garson."
White Collar,"I'm going suggest that if you liked White Collar, check out Miss Fisher's Murder Mysteries."
White Collar,"White Collar is not an amazing show, it's trashy, pulpy nonsense with little to no artistic value.

Which is not to say I didn't absolutely love the hell out of it, it was my guilty pleasure and I watched all 6 seasons without regret, but that doesn't mean it's actually, well, 'good'. "
White Collar,I knew a guy irl who was basically Mozzie in personality. Turns out Mozzie is super annoying in reality. But I still like the TV version.
White Collar,"*""Hi, Suit .... Hi, Mrs Suit ...""*

Loved Mozzie in this"
White Collar,Oh Mozzie
White Collar,That period when they had both Psyche and White Collar on the roster was so good.
White Collar,damn straight
White Collar,"Dramedys have really fallen out of favor for self-deprecating and self-loathing shows.  I miss shows like Psych, White Collar, Chuck, Ugly Betty...  Playing House just doesn't grab me and pull me in the same way."
White Collar,People love dark and edgy stuff these days
White Collar,Don't forget Alexandra Daddario.
White Collar,"+1 for Imposters, very fun show, short series. Enjoyed it waaaaay more than I thought and only watched it quite recently, very under the radar, imo"
White Collar,Does leave it open to the possibility of a spin off/movie or something though
White Collar,"I liked the one where moz buys the storage container, when they find the clues to the spy ring"
White Collar,My favorite is when they run the heist with the other Neal Caffrey-esque thief and steal the baseball from the Yankees. 
White Collar,"*Suits*, *Burn Notice*, *White Collar*, *Covert Affairs*, *Royal Pains*; they *all* have very similar feels. And I miss that feel"
White Collar,[deleted]
White Collar,"I finished suits. I should watch white collar then, right?"
White Collar,That was during the period of USA network where all shows were  about pretty people who could do just about everything.
White Collar,I stopped caring about suits when it turned into a soap opera
White Collar," > actually sent Mike to jail

It was a great move for the show...until it was completely undone and essentially became meaningless a few episodes later."
White Collar,Why would you watch 81 episodes of something if you didn't think it was good.
White Collar,If something is enjoyable it's good. Fuck artistic value. Fuck Critical success. Fuck analyzing movies and shows like we're freshman English majors. 
White Collar,"Is that you, Suit?"
White Collar,A guy you can take in doses...and that's about it.
White Collar,And I think Suits was there with them for a year or two as well.
White Collar,"I watched an episode or two of Jane the Virgin and had a similar tone, which I liked, but the larger story didn't interest me. "
White Collar,"Considering the direction cartoons like adventure time, Gumball, and gravity falls have taken, yeah.

For heaven's sakes a (magical?) nuclear holocaust is central to adventure time's backstory. And genocide to Steven universe's. At least Gumball seems relatively normal."
How I Met Your Mother,"I thought it was a great show. Really funny but could be dramatic, great callbacks and inside jokes. It starts to run out of steam the last couple of seasons unfortunately. I liked ted /shrug, couldn't say why."
How I Met Your Mother,"It’s like, I hate fish. Fucking disgusting. I put it in my mouth and I wanna throw up, like it’s poison and my body is working to reject it.  But people love fish. There are entire seafood restaurants designed to serve it. People pay substantial premiums to have it served to them.   But do I demand that people explain their love for fish?  No, that would be ridiculous. They can’t make me love it by arguing anymore than they’re going to suddenly decide they hate fish because I explain why I super duper hate it.

What’s there to say?  I think it’s hilarious. You don’t. Clearly enough people agree with me to justify nine seasons and at least two seasons of a spin-off."
How I Met Your Mother,"Barney used to be very funny, we as a society had a very different mindset about his attitude towards women 15 years ago.

I think the show was brilliantly written quite often, particularly in the early seasons. Fantastic running gags that went beyond what most other sitcoms did. Great plots, and I do think many jokes were great. The way they played with time was also quite unique and intriguing."
How I Met Your Mother,You complain about jokes and then say how friends is a good example of doing it right?
How I Met Your Mother,"It wasn't a big success, but good enough to get renewed. Annual rankings in the US Nielsen ratings (2005-2014): 54, 61, 70, 49, 42, 48, 45, 42, 28. Other shows around those rankings are The Middle and Two Broke Girls.

It had a strong serial component to it, and so some loyal fans. It usually managed a funny segment in an episode, and some of that solidified into running gags."
How I Met Your Mother,"I think, for me, it’s a show that was elevated by the casting. I always believed this could be a group of friends who would hang out in real life. 

I always enjoyed how they reacted to each other, laugh at jokes etc. I liked that they had jobs although these were very tertiary to the show it did feel mostly genuine. Some of the humour probably doesn’t age as well in this day and age but I think the core will always be there. It’s a comfortable show and one I enjoy rewatching."
How I Met Your Mother,I think it's funny how some people on the TV sub slag off The Big Bang Theory but champion How I Met Your Mother. These people are as daft as the Redditors who think Frasier and It's Always Sunny are highbrow compared to Friends. It's all light entertainment!
How I Met Your Mother,Lol what….show was great. That’s how
How I Met Your Mother,Because it was great and people enjoyed it
How I Met Your Mother,"And yet here you are…. Interesting, no?"
How I Met Your Mother,"How old were you, when it first aired or you first watched it and you obviously disliked it?

It’s not an adults show. It’s a show for teenagers and young adults. When the last season aired I was 21 or 22 I think. So people that were younger, starting with season 1 many years before, they made that show a success. Most of them by the way had never seen Friends, at least were I live. So we didn’t see a connection back then.

It was amazing to watch and integrate Barney’s Stuff etc in our lifestyle. Sounds stupid now and I wouldn’t watch the show again. But it still had an impact."
How I Met Your Mother,"Love HIMYM

Hate Friends"
How I Met Your Mother,"Right? I cant stand the extremely normie humor of the show, i met a bunch of people in college that unironically liked this shit and I looked at them differently after that"
How I Met Your Mother,"You could ask the same of ""the big bang theory"" or ""two and a half Men"" or any number of non funny sitcoms from the 2000-2010's"
How I Met Your Mother,It had cute girls in it.
How I Met Your Mother,It was relatable. I know many might scoff at that but i knew so many 20-30 somethings who were in cliques just like these people back in the 2000s
How I Met Your Mother,"I have no idea, and I've wondered the same thing. No character is likable and it's all very basic sitcom ""jokes."""
How I Met Your Mother,"Millennials have pretty trash taste in television shows, that’s how."
How I Met Your Mother,you've got to appreciate shows that at least gave an ending.
How I Met Your Mother,The humor played as edgier and funnier than Friends at the time.
How I Met Your Mother,"At that time it filled in what people were missing from Friends. Friends ended in 2004 and HIMYM debuted in 2005. People still wanted that group of friends dynamic. 

The humor was catchy, but kinda predictable. Still, we all loved to quote Barney's ""It's going to be leg...Wait for it....dary!"" They were all relatively attractive and had great chemistry together. 

No one really liked the Ted Mosby character, but we all laughed when he was being made fun of. 

Also Robin Sparkles was a hilarious twist!"
How I Met Your Mother,">Barney would have been utterly unwatchable if not played by Neil Patrick Harris.

But he *was* played by Neil Patrick Harris."
How I Met Your Mother,You hit the nail on the head......... Although I do love sea food .
How I Met Your Mother,">It’s like, I hate fish. Fucking disgusting. I put it in my mouth and I wanna throw up, like it’s poison and my body is working to reject it. But people love fish.

No, that would be ridiculous. They can’t make me love it by arguing anymore than they’re going to suddenly decide they hate fish because I explain why I super duper hate it.



This is r/television.  I think the topic is up for grabs."
How I Met Your Mother,"The joke was always on barney, not the women he went after."
How I Met Your Mother,"> Barney used to be very funny, we as a society had a very different mindset about his attitude towards women 15 years ago.

Barney's behavior was always presented as not okay - maybe you just were too young realize that when you watched it initially?"
How I Met Your Mother,[deleted]
How I Met Your Mother,">Barney used to be very funny, we as a society had a very different mindset about his attitude towards women 15 years ago.

Barney's behaviour was called out, even then."
How I Met Your Mother,"I don't know why you're appealing to ""society"" with regards to Barney's character. It's always a joke about how NPH is gay, and everyone knows that, so him playing womanizers is ironic. Normal people get this joke. It's the same thing he did in Harold and Kumar."
How I Met Your Mother,"I mean, here we are, are?

On r/television?"
How I Met Your Mother,">How old were you, when it first aired or you first watched it and you obviously disliked it?

Eighteen.

>It’s not an adults show. It’s a show for teenagers and young adults.

It's a show about mid-twentysomethings. It's absolutely an adult show."
How I Met Your Mother,"I mean, as I said in the OP, I didn't think Friends was much to write home about, either."
How I Met Your Mother,"I mean, as bad as they were, at least they had an adult approach? How I Met Your Mother just feels like a kids sitcom with sexual references."
How I Met Your Mother,Dawg two and a half men was phenomenal (until Charlie left)
How I Met Your Mother,"I think Lilly and Marshall are likeable, although that's more down to Hannigan and Segal uplifting the writing and chemistry together as actors.  Robin's a hit piece on women, with Chloe Summers defying the writing. No wonder people hated the ending.  

Even by the standards of 'comfort viewing' it's bad. It's VERY telling that The Goodwin Games (Carter and Bayes other sitcom on NBC which aired during How I Met Your Mother's run) which only lasted one season bombed without much network oversight."
How I Met Your Mother,"That, indeed, he was."
How I Met Your Mother,"Hm it's true that I wasn't aware of these topics back then, so my perception has definitely changed. That said, I think back then the audience was more willing to laugh at the things he did than we do now. Mainstream humor is much more sensitive towards marginalized groups and politically correct these days."
How I Met Your Mother,This is why nothings funny anymore….sitcom sexual jokes aren’t even allowed to be funny anymore
How I Met Your Mother,"In the early seasons mostly. At some point he starts ""mentoring"" Ted and they definitely lean way more into the fantasy of hookup artists.

One thing that I did think they handled well and never drew too much attention to, was showing how his schemes and trickery was actually way less effective than just talking to someone.

Anyway since I don't feel like making a separate comment, I think it was so popular because of the cast combined with the mystery. It really felt like they were going somewhere smart with the Mother reveal... Until they didn't.

They also had a lot of stunts. The Britney Spears episode was the first one to really get huge ratings. And they kept coming back to the Robin Sparkles well."
How I Met Your Mother,"It's not so much about his sexuality but about the way he treated women. Back then we laughed about it, today a character like him wouldn't fly."
How I Met Your Mother,"I mean that for a show that you found so shitty, you watched it and even felt compelled to write online about it…

I find that interesting."
How I Met Your Mother,"Nah it’s not. The characters are in their mid twenty’s . But the jokes are not. They are absolutely „legendary“ and super funny for a 16 year old. They are not if you are 26 and have watched quality shows. Or even if you are 18 but have watched a lot of high quality shows and have movie and tv knowledge. That’s not the target group.

It’s like saying Dragonball Z is for adults cause Adults fight and are the main characters. Even if the made it in the intention to target mid20s, it just works just so much better for late puberty. At least the first seasons."
How I Met Your Mother,TF is an adult approach? The humour in two and a half men is prolly the most childish out of all the sitcoms
How I Met Your Mother,"You all act like Barney was going around killing and eating women, lol."
How I Met Your Mother,I think you greatly overestimate what's happening here.
How I Met Your Mother,The show was made for the demo 18-40…wtf are you talking about
How I Met Your Mother,"That doesn't make any sense. It's a show that aired in a prime time slot. 

How I Met Your Mother was very much CBS tapping into the Friends audience."
How I Met Your Mother,Tell me you were 12 when this show aired by not telling me you were 12…
How I Met Your Mother,"Yeah, like as I was saying in my OP, Two and Half Men actually feels adult in construction, even if the jokes are puerile."
How I Met Your Mother,"When people say a character ""wouldn't fly"" now, it means they wouldn't be allowed onscreen, not that the audience wouldn't enjoy them."
How I Met Your Mother,Or you are greatly underestimating it
How I Met Your Mother,"It makes sense if you understand why the show was successful.

The show found a way into the pop culture of the time by covering topics like sexual needs, dating, single life or relationships. The point is that the show treated these topics differently than other shows by building banal myths around these topics and presenting them as real existing patterns. The basic myth is the question of the mother. Farther ones are, for example, ""the naked man,"" ""the madness curve,"" ""the playbook,"" ""the group effect,"" ""the woo-girl,"" ""the double,"" ""the grabber and the grabbed,"" and so on.

Topics that are also covered in Friends, for example. The difference is the explicit myth and the building of a pop culture about these themes in society. Barney's Playbook as merchandise, which worked great as a marketing tool and building these myths even further.

It's also particularly important that the series wasn't only successful in the USA. It was a worldwide hit. And that's precisely because these spun-out myths have an overarching effect and appeal to a target group that, on the one hand, thinks even more imaginatively than adults and picks up on topics that interest precisely them. 

So even if CBS wanted a Friends replacement, this was something actually completely new. A series based on myths (mostly lies) and legends, bringing their views into schoolyards and universities by creating a pop culture around those myths. At the top, of course, is the question of the mother. One by one pealing off this myth onion while the audience gets older and then finally facing reality in the last two episodes. 

Maybe it started out as a different thing. But I’m pretty sure the marketing team on cbs knew that the way to make this thing a worldwide hit was sticking to those patterns."
How I Met Your Mother,"I was 15 when the first season premiered in the country I live in. Also me being under 18 when this show aired proves my point. 

Another thing: what’s the problem with being 12 years old? Any complexes?"
How I Met Your Mother,"Question: did you like B99 ? They also use the ""go over the top with the shenanigans"" approach while satirizing cops and some aspects of the workplace in general. It's not even close to the same thing but the overall 'construction' is similiar, like a lot of the humour literally comes from the fact that the lead is a bit kiddish"
How I Met Your Mother,"What is an adult construction? HIMYM is an over the top sitcom with a very casual approach that also has serious moments and 'life lessons'. So yes the general theme is a bit immature , but they didn't want to become just another friends - so they went over the top with the shenanigans to differentiate themselves. I personally like friends better for these reasons but HIMYM is still a nice sitcom,maybe not your taste but that is subjective afterall."
How I Met Your Mother,"But worse characters are allowed onscreen. Murderers, rapists, communists. I don't get the point."
How I Met Your Mother,"Dude, this is not r/howimetyourmother.  It's okay for people to question WHY the show was a success. 

No offense, but you need to be less than one with the algorithm or defending the show's honour or whatever is going on here.

In the end, none of this matters."
How I Met Your Mother,">Topics that are also covered in Friends, for example. The difference is the explicit myth and the building of a pop culture about these themes in society.

I mean, Friends did that as well. Friends wasn't exactly 'real', either."
How I Met Your Mother,The show wasn’t made for 12 year olds…
How I Met Your Mother,"Still feels like it's 'adult' in construction, even with Jake."
How I Met Your Mother,">What is an adult construction?

I feel like we're going to dance around in circles here."
How I Met Your Mother,"Dude. (Since that seems to be your thing). 

I am neither defending nor bashing the show. Neither am I disputing your right to challenge why it was successful. 
What I am doing is pointing out that whatever it was doing to be successful, seems to have worked on you. 

That’s all."
How I Met Your Mother,"I know that friends even had sone of the same myths, it’s pretty obvious, but it’s the way the scenes are shot that are vastly different. „the naked man“ in Friends is a scene just occasionally happening in a normal episode. It’s not everything that Episode is about. It’s not shot as a man with a waving cape on his back, making the pose of a super popular Rum Pirate and stuff like that. It becomes „a thing“ after HIMYMs implementation because it is supposed to become a thing. It’s just marketing, mythbuilding. That’s how the show worked. You have to have watched HIMYM the time it aired, talked with people about it because it made those myths „a thing“. You can watch friends 20 years later and it’s just absolutely great and works perfect as a binge series. HIMYM works with everything that happens not on the show the best. If you talk about it. That’s why it was successfull."
How I Met Your Mother,"First, like I said I was 15. So unnecessary argument. Second. It’s 14+ (TV14), so not that far away"
How I Met Your Mother,"The show is pretty much top 3 most popular sitcoms of this century ( Friends,the office, HIMYM) in that order , couldn't have happened without adults liking the show 🤦🏿‍♂️.

> I feel like we're going to dance around in circles here 

Yeah no shit, this is why I ended my comment with taste is subjective ,just because you think the show is not of an 'adult construction '( whatever that means) doesn't mean it's the objective truth ."
How I Met Your Mother,">What I am doing is pointing out that whatever it was doing to be successful, seems to have worked on you. 

Uh, what?

>I am neither defending nor bashing the show. Neither am I disputing your right to challenge why it was successful.

Then, why show up?"
How I Met Your Mother,It’s a figure of speech hombre….they don’t have that in your country? It’s not suppose to be taken so literally lol
How I Met Your Mother,[removed]
How I Met Your Mother,"None are so blind as those who will not see

Have a nice life."
How I Met Your Mother,"It doesn’t make any sense with what I have written other than you spending your time on the internet making fun of people. I wrote about late teens and YA enjoying the show. So obviously I, myself was Young when the first season aired. I even used references to that. Your „figure of speech“ just states the obvious that’s in my text. Its unnecessary."

How I Met Your Mother,"Lol I hated how they wrote her out in HIMYM.

Come to think of it, all of Barneys 3 steady girlfriends(including Robin) were very fun to watch, but they all got written out terribly."
How I Met Your Mother,She was excellent in Counterpart.
How I Met Your Mother,"I recognized her, but couldn't place where from (""who *is* she?!"") until I looked up her IMDB and saw *Counterpart*. Thought she was incredible in that series and she's been great so far in *Rings of Power*. Her plot is one of the more interesting so far to me."
How I Met Your Mother,shes so fucking hot. how did that whole village not gather to fuck her brains out by that well
How I Met Your Mother,Really intrigued by her story in Rings of Power.
How I Met Your Mother,She is so bad in Rings of power.  She can't act
How I Met Your Mother,She was good in her two seasons of Homeland.
How I Met Your Mother,Nora was fantastic and made a good foil for Barney.
How I Met Your Mother,"I never really clicked with Quinn that much, but I loved Nora."
How I Met Your Mother,That show deserved at least another season.
How I Met Your Mother,Yes she was
How I Met Your Mother,Yes and such a great show. Too bad it didn't get the viewership.
How I Met Your Mother,"That show was so fucking good, I’m still mad they canceled it."
How I Met Your Mother,"Turns out we were the prime world all along. Fantastic show, and she did really well in it. So far I'm liking her role in Rings of Power, but it has only been two episodes (in a show juggling four plot lines) so she hasn't gotten all that much screen time yet."
How I Met Your Mother,How can you tell?
How I Met Your Mother,No.
How I Met Your Mother,"Another season would have been great. 

But, if all we ever get is the two seasons, I like the ending we got."
How I Met Your Mother,i did the casting.
How I Met Your Mother,indeed
How I Met Your Mother,"But in an ocean of bad acting, how does she stand out?"
How I Met Your Mother,stand in
How I Met Your Mother,T-Dog
How I Met Your Mother,That slow head shake after he writes the second F is one of my favorite things on the show. I would rank it above Alan Thicke singing a Crash Test Dummies cover about Barney and Robin.  The timing and the body language is just perfect.
How I Met Your Mother,My unpopular opinion will always be that How I Met Your Mother was better than Friends.
Criminal Minds,Tbh i am really loving this show. Glad its renewed
Criminal Minds,Not shocked it’s probably one of their most watched shows. I’m stroked for more!
Criminal Minds,It's not the same without Reid.
Criminal Minds,"The transition to streaming makes the show SO much better. They go after serial killers. Being able to curse and use more realistic language overall makes the show so much more watchable then when it was on CBS and they had to be like “oh darn it! This evil person killed again!”  

It’s a shame that Reid didn’t want to come back, they didn’t try to replace him so maybe they are still hoping he will come back. 

It’s also nice to see them focus on their private lives and how the job affects them. 

Lastly, has anyone noticed that the person who plays Zach Gilford’s wife is his real life wife? She’s so pretty. He’s a scary AF villain."
Criminal Minds,"This format is so great, having just ""one"" big bad for a season-long arc.  Episodic procedurals have their appeal, but I do like having more time to flesh out the characters."
Criminal Minds,Do I have to watch the original series?
Criminal Minds,I think that this was one of the fastest revivals ever. For now I don't intent to watch it. S15 ended nicely.
Criminal Minds,So does this mean more hope for a certain pairing slow-burning
Criminal Minds,I'm glad it's renewed since they never finished the first season.
Criminal Minds,So glad they renewed it more Emily more Dave please xxx
Criminal Minds,"Same.  While I did enjoy the original network version of the show, I feel like its quality was just OK and it had some serious dips in quality and leaps in logic to get the team to the right place to catch the killer.

This new season, however has really been FANTASTIC.  Hearing Rossi dropping the f-bomb was great and really makes his character complete.

I love the longer story arc and I can't wait to see what the second half brings."
Criminal Minds,"> I’m stroked for more

It's that good eh?"
Criminal Minds,"Don't blame him for wanting to move on tbh, he's the only member of the main cast that's been on the entire original run for like 16 seasons or whatever, probably wanted to do something else."
Criminal Minds,"Reid’s not in it!? Damn I was waiting to watch it til the season finished, he was my favorite other than Mandy Patinkin, plus he was the one who delivered a lot of exposition and profiling jargon/strategy quickly and clearly. Won’t be the same without him"
Criminal Minds,"Lol whenever their private lives came up in the old show, you just knew it’s because their family was about to be kidnapped or something. Every character is that show had someone close to them murdered or kidnapped at some point lol."
Criminal Minds,"Been meaning to check out the reboot. Is it still case of the week styled? 

Or did the switch to streaming allow them to switch to a more continuous story as well? Instead of just reserving that to premieres/finale and a few min at end of each epsiode"
Criminal Minds,">Lastly, has anyone noticed that the person who plays Zach Gilford’s wife is his real life wife? She’s so pretty. He’s a scary AF villain.

Didn't they play husband and wife in that one Purge movie too? It's neat to see they like working together"
Criminal Minds,"Yeah the mix up from the killer of the week to this season long arc is so much better. 

Also the language is massively improved. Before it was just painful to watch a show about serial killers but nobody was allowed to say fuck 😂 Crazy shit. So much better with more real world language. 

They're still playing it safe but have taken some good steps forward in modernising the show as it was very dated when it finished back in 2020. 

I hope with the success of Evolution we see them push things forward a bit more. Drop the over done ""we're shutting down the BAU"" storylines and go with some more hardcore, highly intelligent season long absolute psychos. The best thing about Elias Voit this season is he is smart and they can show us that rather than wrap it up in 45 minutes."
Criminal Minds,It’s better than a lot of the later seasons. I would recommend jumping back in!
Criminal Minds,"I'm confused, who's ""they""?"
Criminal Minds,"Reid had one background role before landing Criminal Minds. 

That dude needs to play the lottery if he’s this lucky."
Criminal Minds,"plus i feel like of that original cast, hes someone that seems to be looking for doing something other than more of a CBS procedural."
Criminal Minds,It's pretty good so far honestly
Criminal Minds,"It’s a season long serial killer. Which is far more realistic, I mean, one small group of trained gov’t officials catch 20+ SERIAL KILLERS per year? It’s much better in every way other than it being on a semi-niche streaming service. I love seeing how they deal with the trauma of what they see in their personal lives, and how we get to learn more about the bad guy..his history, his present “real life” etc.  We get the opportunity to become  more invested in the characters. It’s now a bit closer in quality to Bosch than network procedurals I think."
Criminal Minds,"Both. There's an overarching case that's discussed every week, but they also do cases that only last an episode."
Criminal Minds,Paramount
Criminal Minds,I'm guessing you haven't watched it yet.  I'm pretty sure they are still catching one serial killer per episode.  Inside of a more constrained limited time frame
Criminal Minds,"Yes I’ve watched every episode so far. 

*spoilers to follow*


Everyone they caught works for the big bad. It’s all connected. It’s not completely different killers/storyline each episode, it’s one 10? episode story about one serial killer network."
Criminal Minds,Criminals have evolved. Not just murder… Super murder!
Criminal Minds,"So what I’m hearing is that Paget Brewster is free to do the Community movie, right?"
Criminal Minds,"I gave up on this show a decade ago, but a self contained season long arc actually sounds really fucking good"
Criminal Minds,"> In “Criminal Minds: Evolution,” the FBI’s elite team of criminal profilers come up against their greatest threat yet, an UnSub who has used the pandemic to build a network of other serial killers. As the world opens back up and the network goes operational, the team must hunt them down, one murder at a time.

Sounds very plausible...."
Criminal Minds,"I once kind of liked that show, but it became so formulaic that it was ridiculous. I found the scene where they give their profile extremely grating. Where they basically finish each others sentences. In real life where do 5 or more people present information like that? One person would explain what the group has learned. The rest might answer questions if needed. It is just so weird."
Criminal Minds,"I liked this show so much back in the day. For me all the horror of supernatural villains has never been that scary, because I simply don't believe in them. Like sure, I get jump scared by jump scares, but that's just being a human, but otherwise they're pretty much ""i could not give less fucks"". But when it's about real world murderers (naturally Criminal Minds went insanely overboard with it), it gets way scarier. Because there are way too many of them actually around. While some demons, ghosts etc... everyone knows they're a joke."
Criminal Minds,"Criminal Minds is so unintentionally funny there have been times that I have been borderline convinced that it's a parody. The little quotes they give at the end of each episode are always bizarre and hilarious. My favorite episode is when they have to free hostages from a Waco-style compound run by Luke Perry as Totally-Not David Koresh and Paget Brewster gets the ever-loving shit beat out of her for like, an absurdly long time, all shot like that scene in Taken when Liam Neeson climbs a fence."
Criminal Minds,The season finale is the Scopes Monkey Trial
Criminal Minds,So which serial killer will be a Kingdom Hearts boss?
Criminal Minds,When criminals don’t play by the rules…
Criminal Minds,gonna be fun watching Mantegna's embalmed remains pretend to rush from desk to door after some emergency
Criminal Minds,"Why not show it on ION, aka the 24-hour Criminal Minds channel."
Criminal Minds,Rossi is lookin real rough these days
Criminal Minds,"Yeah, I don't think the ""highly anticipated series"" part is accurate."
Criminal Minds,I would be a lot better with the original cast. I stopped watching because I didn't care for the new cast members. I miss Thomas Gibson. His acting career seems to be over.
Criminal Minds,"CBS murder shows really paint a bleak picture of America. Naval officers are killed by the dozens every year (according to NCIS), and there are apparently 20+ serial killers actively hunting people on Criminal Minds."
Criminal Minds,[deleted]
Criminal Minds,Now even the title is stupid.
Criminal Minds,So Disney+ in Canada but not in the US? Yeah I’m not going to sign up for another streaming service to watch this.
Criminal Minds,No thanks.
Criminal Minds,I've had enough can we come up with newer ideas
Criminal Minds,I’m pretty sure the premise of Evolution is just ripped from the Following with Kevin Bacon
Criminal Minds,"I know it’s likely just a joke, but for anyone out there that might be interested — it looks like the show is taking the opportunity (lack of network “make it tamer so we can put it on national TV”) to actually make the show “darker.”

That’s the thought I got from the trailer. Might be wrong"
Criminal Minds,No more undulating high-pitched whistles that makes her nose bleed.
Criminal Minds,"This was my wife's ""turn brain off"" show for awhile and even she gave up after 8 seasons. There is only so many times you can watch the same type of formula.

1. Murderer kills someone
2. Group investigates crime scene
3. Murderer kidnaps or nearly kills someone else
4. Group finds that one clue that leads them to the killer
5. One of the good guys almost gets killed
6. Murderer gets shot by good guys

Rinse and repeat."
Criminal Minds,“What if Reddit but serial killers.” Network TV writers have the easiest job in Hollywood I STG
Criminal Minds,It was so jarring. I have to imagine each cast member had a “lines per episode” quota the writers had to meet.
Criminal Minds,[NEVER FORGET](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJQZst2mEQw)
Criminal Minds,Unfortunately the restrictions of network tv ensure that none of the “unsubs” reflect anything resembling a real life monster.
Criminal Minds,"It was rare, but whenever the monster of the week turned out to be just people on Supernatural, those were the freakiest."
Criminal Minds,"If you like unintentionally hilarious network dramas, I highly recommend the 911 shows. The writers painfully attempt to add pathos to their schlock writing every episode as rural Texas becomes the site of a once-in-a-millennium volcanic eruption. Again, in Texas."
Criminal Minds,"Oh come on, dude looks perfectly fine for being 75 years old."
Criminal Minds,Criminal Minds was constantly among the Top 10 streamed shows in the US on Nielsen's Streaming charts while it was still on Netflix. It clearly has a fanbase. Oh and the guy who writes all these articles for the linked website is a middle-aged man who constantly hypes up these older shows so ig he's also writing about himself as well.
Criminal Minds,And he never followed up on his boxing career either.
Criminal Minds,"I am watching it the first time, and  I reached the episode where he left and honestly I have been struggling for a month to continue. It felt like a chore. So I finally accepted to stop watching and it wasn't the same anymore without Shemar and Thomas."
Criminal Minds,You know there are stupid shows like that in almost every country.
Criminal Minds,"Canada doesn't have Hulu, but D+ has Star which has most of the Hulu stuff."
Criminal Minds,It is on Paramount+ in the US. Disney just seem to have the international rights to the show.
Criminal Minds,Because Paramount owns the show in the US. Disney has only international distribution rights. It was the same for the original series as well.
Criminal Minds,The original series was dark as hell tbh. I mean you had a guy abducting people and stealing their spinal fluid ffs.
Criminal Minds,"Did they turn one of the characters into a killer? I have not been able to make myself check, but it is my assumption."
Criminal Minds,Certainly seems like it.  I like that it's gonna be a season long arc as well rather than mostly self-contained episodes with a few multi-episode long arcs here and there.
Criminal Minds,"Basically every Law and Order episode since the reboot has been ripped straight off of news headlines and just slightly modified.  Like last season, there was a carbon copy of the Gabby Petito story."
Criminal Minds,"Holy shit, how is that not a parody? 🤣"
Criminal Minds,Ah.
Criminal Minds,"The first few seasons, then criminal minds became a parody of itself when that idiotic character of the computer genius / deus ex machina took over the whole fucking show."
Criminal Minds,Yeah isn't that why the original lead dude left the series? I seem to remember reading that he thought it was too dark or something.
Criminal Minds,"No, but Reid did spend half a season in prison"
Criminal Minds,"The ending was kinda bad though

“It’s you, you’re the criminal minds!”"
Criminal Minds,"Wow, what a truly bad take, good job."
Criminal Minds,"Yeah Mandy Patinkin left as he found the material difficult week after week. Interestingly he went on to work on Homeland though which is pretty fucking dark too (far darker in many ways). 

I guess it wasn't constant week after week though, while a major character on Homeland he didn't have huge amounts of screen time so I suspect he got most of his scenes filmed in a short amount of time then had a nice break between seasons."
Criminal Minds,Yup.
Criminal Minds,"In the end, our friendship was the true criminal mind."
Criminal Minds,"Mandy is just difficult to work with and has a stuck up diva attitude.  He has a track record of doing that sort of shit on other productions.  For Chicago Hope, he once said:

> ""I never let directors talk to me, because I was so spoiled. ... I was saying, 'Don't talk to me, I don't want your opinion.' 

(Source: https://www.looper.com/28627/actors-everyone-hates-working/)

Anyways, back to Criminal Minds and Mandy.  The material was dark, yet it took him 3 seasons to quit the show. it's like dude, you're doing a procedural of a fictional FBI team jetting around the country catching the most depraved human beings to ever walk this earth, you have some weird expectations or you're an awful actor if you can't piece together that the formula wasn't gonna change after 20+ episodes.  Dunno what he was expecting, and he could've manned up, be a mature professional given his stature in the industry, set a good example, and told the cast and crew that he's burnt out instead of just peacing out one day because he decided the job wasn't for him.  There was a reason his career kinda died out after quitting CM until the Homeland gig came along."
Criminal Minds,Yeah Homeland the show where every muslim is a bad person.  Really Mandy.
Criminal Minds,This is basically the serial killer plot line from Sandman but serious.
Criminal Minds,"Oh Zach Gilford is in this...hopefully he plays the killer. He is a very underrated actor that not a lot of people know about since Friday Night Lights ended. 

If you have some time watch Season 4 episode Epsiode 5 of FNL...the Episode is called The Son and it revolved around Gilfords characters father dying and him dealing with it. Some of the best acting I've ever seen"
Criminal Minds,"Criminal Minds is my guilty pleasure, I know it basically just ended but I'm all for it."
Criminal Minds,"I’ll always have a soft spot for shows like Criminal Minds and the CSI series so I’m actually excited to see both having returned, although I hope this one stays a limited series, unlike CSI Vegas."
Criminal Minds,I like it.  Love moving away from single episode stories into a season long arc ala L&O Organized Crime.
Criminal Minds,Your grandparents will be all over this
Criminal Minds,"Criminal Minds without all of the original cast aside from Garcia and JJ?


Really?  Yeah no thanks"
Criminal Minds,I’m here for it.
Criminal Minds,I'll give it a try.
Criminal Minds,"""This video is not available"""
Criminal Minds,That's Kima
Criminal Minds,"Another serial killer show. People obsession’s with serial killers shows - I find it disturbing. 

I stopped watching original Criminal Minds because it got too much. I think I skip this one."
Criminal Minds,The original series sucked but this actually looks pretty good!
Criminal Minds,Wasn't there a sequel that ended on a cliff hanger?
Criminal Minds,"I still feel bringing this back so soon after it ended is a bad idea. I mean I'm pretty sure even most fans agreed they were running out ideas by the end, the show had gotten to implausible  and barely resembled the initial premise.

Still if it has an audience, I'm sure their enjoy it."
Criminal Minds,The Cereal Convention*** plot line.
Criminal Minds,Midnight Mass on Netflix is phenomenal in large part because of him
Prison Break,"I don't think it's dumb at all, we love what we love and nothing else really matters."
Prison Break,Not at all. The other shows are slow burn and can be quite boring. Prison Break was non stop action. It’s just what you prefer. No big deal.
Prison Break,I enjoyed it a lot too. I loved how the later seasons got pretty ridiculous. Was a fun ride.
Prison Break,"No, it's dumb to care about opinions you disagree with."
Prison Break,T-Bag was _captivating._
Prison Break,It's your tastes buddy!
Prison Break,"I love Prison Break to death, but I also know that its incredibly flawed. Is it one of my favourites in terms of pure enjoyment? Sure. But it sure as hell doesnt deserve any awards either."
Prison Break,"It's one of my favorite shows, I love all of the seasons."
Prison Break,It was good but nowhere near the best show but to each their own.
Prison Break,"Honestly? Yeah, but I’m not mad about it or anything. You do you."
Prison Break,"Weird Al is my favourite band. 

Likes and dislikes aren't bad. Maybe at most it is a little odd."
Prison Break,"best show and favourite show are pretty gigantically different things, nothing wrong in having an opinion 👍"
Prison Break,"You don't have to justify your love of a show to anyone, especially when it is as enduring and seminal a series as PB."
Prison Break,I loved the first two seasons.
Prison Break,"Hey, every show is someone's favorite.

Whether your favorite show is universally-praised, universally-hated, or somewhere in between, there's no shame in it."
Prison Break,Season 1 was really good so no.
Prison Break,"Dumb? No. But if I knew you, I would never value your opinion on television or movies ever knowing that fact. Your endorsement would serve as a warning to stay away from something."
Prison Break,"Season 1 - Some of the best television ever.

Season 2 - Was excellent

Season 3 - lol

Season 4 - lol"
Prison Break,Yes I think its dumb but if you like it great.  Plenty if dumb shows i like.
Prison Break,No if you have seen other shows. Yes if its the only show you've ever seen.
Prison Break,"Don't forget the sequel, Legends of Tomorrow."
Prison Break,"breaking bad, sopranos, the wire, boring."
Prison Break,Season 5 was comically bad.
Prison Break,I think The Wonder Years is the best show ever.
Prison Break,season 1 is great. 2 was eh. 3 was good. the rest ehh but i still enjoy it overall.
Prison Break,"Enjoy whatever you like, but the answer is yes., that's dumb."
Prison Break,"No, but it isn't."
Prison Break,"My favorite show is Once Upon A Time so I know how you feel : )

For me I kind of hedge in that I feel strong enough in my opinion that I think Once is firmly in the top 10 level shows ever... But then there is some personal attachment reasons or some factors like ""did I follow it while it aired instead of it being over"" that is probably contributing to it being 1 instead of 5 or 6 or something."
Prison Break,"I certainly wouldn't agree it's the best show ever, like, as far as objectivity goes (i know its all mostly subjective). But if it's your *favorite* show ever then that's rad. Its cool you like something that much and I'm glad you do!"
Prison Break,"Yeah.

If you said it's your favourite show, I wouldn't, but to consider it the best show ever is just dumb."
Prison Break,"I mean, after he broke out of prison, the show kind of lost direction ..."
Prison Break,"I hated it from minute 1. Neither of us are ""wrong."" Who cares what other people think of your opinion? Like what you like and move on. It literally doesn't matter."
Prison Break,The dude who played Bellick (wade williams) goes to the same dog park as I do and he *still* creeps me out. I always keep my distance.
Prison Break,"S1 remains for me the best TV season i've ever watched, it was intense the entire time.

S2 was still good, but after that it fell sharply.

S3 was a reskin of S1.

S4 was a fucking conspiracy mess."
Prison Break,"Yep. I disagree that it's the best show to ever personally, but the first season is pretty awesome and I can understand if that's what you think."
Prison Break,Thanks :)
Prison Break,Fair enough
Prison Break,">Weird Al is my favourite band.

🎶If you'd like to make a call, please hang up and try again. If you need help, hang up and then dial your oooooperator.🎶"
Prison Break,"I think it's a little different but not way different. I was thinking when the Sight and Sound film list came out what mind would be, and some of them seemed like no brainer picks like Apocalypse Now or All About Eve, but then I got to like Garden State, which was my favorite movie when I was 16. I think it's top 10 most important films to me. Now if I had to submit a 10 best movies of all time list like that, I think I would hesitate on it and wonder if the personal attachment was too significant. On the other hand, I still objectively think Garden State is really good. I would never have a movie in consideration for my top 10 all time that I didn't objectively think was top 99% percentile good for films. I'd be comfortable voting for it as one of the best 50 movies of all time or something. But putting it top 10 might be just a little strong and driven by nostalgia."
Prison Break,Not even a mention for season 5 😂
Prison Break,Understandable take. I guess I still liked 3 and 4 just because of the characters
Prison Break,3 and 4 still more entertaining than anything in network tv today
Prison Break,"that is true as well. I also have lots of movies that I consider great and favourites as well. Certain favourites aren't masterpieces, like, say Spielberg's 1941 which nobody likes but I love it"
Prison Break,Just watch season 1 as a mini series and stop there
Prison Break,"1st season is amazing. Well planned out and acted and written. Definitely worth a watch. But you can tell they had an idea for one season and that was it. Second season went so downhill I didn't finish it.

That first season is gold though. Don't regret watching it one bit. Definitely worth watching on its own."
Prison Break,S01 was fun but stressful. S02 onwards was just stupid.
Prison Break,"Everyone is saying to watch Season 1 as a mini-series. I can tell you that I thoroughly enjoyed the later seasons for their goofiness. But like, you gotta take an edible and then watch em."
Prison Break,"1st season is great

2nd is, why not  
3rd, ... are trash"
Prison Break,"I remember watching the first 3 seasons live before falling off. That was….17 years ago 🤢  
The first season was great, and not surprisingly, follows through on the entire titular prison break. Watching the first season as a contained series and just sort of mentally block the following ones, I’d recommend.

S2 is them on the run, and S3 is in a Mexican prison I believe. Don’t know what happens after that, but I think it returned for a mini-series a few years ago. But even I’m interesting in maybe giving S1 a rewatch."
Prison Break,"FYI, it was originally a 13 episodes series that got extended so the quality goes to shit.

Still fun, and if you watch dont forget the movie"
Prison Break,Season 1 is awesome
Prison Break,First season is great. It goes downhill after that but season two is okay. Never finished the shitty revival but I thought the finale of the original series was final enough that it didn't need a revival.
Prison Break,Season 1 is some great stuff 2 is ok it goes to crap from there
Prison Break,"Yes, great show! Especially seasons 1 and 2"
Prison Break,"With so much content available, I would say no.

The first season is good but it's a full season with 22 episodes, and I can't recommend watching 22 episodes of a show that is not great and goes downhill after the second season."
Prison Break,"Like everyone is saying, it goes downhill after season 1 but I’d recommend you just stop when you stop enjoying it, I actually made it through the whole show because even though the writing was godawful it was still fun and had the same characters. I genuinely enjoyed all of it even the later seasons."
Prison Break,I actually thought season 2 was a decent follow up but yeah everything after that is shit
Prison Break,Costa Rica. Not Mexico. But it was shit.
Prison Break,You can tell.  I thought they really dragged out season 1 and it would have been significantly better if they limited it to 13 episodes.
Prison Break,Agreed
Prison Break,"Yup the first two seasons are great. Plus season 2 probably has the most intriguing character in it, that FBI guy."
Prison Break,"Season 2 is optional, but yeah. Great to good to shit."
Prison Break,panama
Prison Break,It helps that William Fichtner is great in everything he’s in.
Prison Break,Except the later seasons of PB admittedly but he was on a sinking ship
Prison Break,"Didn't the Prison break character have some weird neurological issue that wasn't called Autism? Something like he couldn't see the Forest for the Trees, so when he looked at the prison he didn't see a prison but a bunch of pipes and concrete? 

I could swear that was an episode explaining why he was so atypical analytical."
Prison Break,Didn't watch Prison Break but he was good at hamming it up on Flash And Legends.
Prison Break,He lived near me and came to a local grocery store that I worked at pretty regularly - he’s a really great guy and loves his soup lol
Prison Break,"He always seemed like an intense, introverted kind of guy. Makes sense. Good for him."
Prison Break,Live action Chris Redfeild as well
Prison Break,"His captain cold is one of my favorite superhero related performances.  You can really see how much fun he has with the role.

The fact that he can speak out this way not only about this but his previous battles.with depression is wonderful.

As someone on the spectrum myself (although high functioning) its heartening to see things like this."
Prison Break,"I hope this shows people that not everyone with autism is someone who basically can't take care of themself. We always see the extreme cases in the media, like a guy who seems to have no social filter and just blurts out everything he thinks, or has other ""weird"" behaviour... but sometimes people have it and you can't even tell."
Prison Break,"This article about him has had a surprising amount of real estate in my head since it came out: 

[Wentworth Miller opens up about depression, suicidal thoughts while addressing fat-shaming meme](https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/gossip/la-et-mg-wentworth-miller-depression-fat-shaming-meme-htmlstory.html)

I was worried about him. Robin Williams hit me hard. Seems like he's doing better, loved his character on Flash and Legends."
Prison Break,Michael Scofield and Captain Cold are such different characters. Yet both roles seemed to have been made for him. Great actor.
Prison Break,"We knew this, only an autistic person could had planned the perfect prison break."
Prison Break,We’ve come a long way in understanding autism since Rain Man
Prison Break,A LILA...Late In Life Autistic
Prison Break,49 years old wow
Prison Break,Woop captain cold. Love this guy :0
Prison Break,"Gay, biracial and on the spectrum-- he's got a nerd bingo! Bring him back to Legends."
Prison Break,How is it diagnosed? Especially when in adulthood? Like what sort of tests are done.
Prison Break,Where are my Dinotopia fans at tho
Prison Break,"He's one of, if not my favorite character from Flash. Great in legends of tomorrow too."
Prison Break,Love him. I saw him at a hotel once and it made my year.
Prison Break,"As someone who's almost 30 and known most of his life he was Autistic but told almost no one for fear of being seen as an ""other"", (and only two good friends and one ex within the past year) this makes me really happy"
Prison Break,I think high functioning autism goes undiagnosed a lot more often than people realize.
Prison Break,"I got diagnosed this year at 42 and in retrospect it all makes sense. It’s a spectrum, after all, and not everyone is going to be between Rainman or Sheldon from Big Bang Theory. Most people consider me normal, just “quiet and intense” or “has a resting bitch face but very smart!” But after a while I was driving my wife crazy with my routines  and restrictions in communication.

I’ve masked many of my symptoms that were more prevalent when I was a child and now am learning what they are and how I can adjust my life and my way of thinking to make things easier. That diagnosis gave me the foundation to seek the right type of therapy and it’s doing wonders for me. 

ASD is not a disease, it just a different way if looking at the world and I need to learn how to let it look back at me so we understand each other!"
Prison Break,Wasnt Michael Schofield revealed to be autistic aswell? Casting director deserves a medal
Prison Break,I remember a lot of rags proclaiming him to be the next big thing when Prison Break was hot.  I don't think I've seen or heard of him in anything since.
Prison Break,[deleted]
Prison Break,"What I would’ve given to have someone like him in the public eye ten years ago. I’m gay, struggling with depression since I was a child and was diagnosed with autism around the time he came out. 
Some days it‘s crushing to feel like your whole being was twisted some and then some more and then some and there‘s no way you can ever fully function as one of those beings called humans you‘re surrounded by and supposed to be like. Most of the time I feel like I can‘t even pass as one of the same species. I have always had trouble making friends because nobody can relate to my level of otherness and it‘s so exhausting having conversations in what feels like a language I don‘t speak very well.  
Him sharing his diagnosis proves to me that I don‘t have to accept this feeling of being so screwed and twisted that I cannot ever be whole or do something with my life. He‘s a successful actor and screenwriter (it’s funny, now I know why „Stoker“ felt weirdly relatable in it‘s strangeness), he‘s working on himself and he‘s out there proving to people like me that it can be done. That even someone like… us… can aspire to be more than shards and cracks. 
To me this is big news. It feels like something that‘ll get me through more than one rough day. And yeah, I guess this is why representation matters so much. 
Such a cool guy!"
Prison Break,Finally seeing the underground autism population coming out. Such a mind fuck living in a society that hates neurodivergents.
Prison Break,Kudos for him to open up about that. Must be really hard to tell the whole world about your most inner issue.
Prison Break,You mean Captian Cold?
Prison Break,Loved this guy every place his been. His Captain Cold was amazing.
Prison Break,"I love this guy and it's great that people are not negative when he reveals something so personal about himself.   

I remember how he looked so relieved when he announced he was gay."
Prison Break,Huh captain cold is that you
Prison Break,LEONARD SNART best character in The Flash
Prison Break,"That’s pretty incredible, Miller is a great actor and extremely fun in roles like Captain Cold from the CW DC shows. Hopefully this inspires many others to not hold back from their dreams."
Prison Break,I’ll always see him as Michael Scofield
Bates Motel,Very overlooked show. Vera Farmiga kills it as Norma Bates.
Bates Motel,"Just finished this a couple months ago, did not disappoint"
Bates Motel,this shit makes me feel old af. I remember my roommate playing this in our living room while studying for our last finals senior year of college. damn its been 10 years lol
Bates Motel,MOTHER!
Bates Motel,Underrated show. I really loved the idea of a contemporary prequel for Norman. The way >!they adapted Psycho!< in the final season was excellent. Entire show was solid.
Bates Motel,10 years!
Bates Motel,So underrated. I was so invested. Vera and Freddie both should have gotten Emmy's.
Bates Motel,Damn I think I stopped watching this show right before Rhianna showed up.  Did it end strong? I might have to pick it up again
Bates Motel,I just finished rewatching this show. The fourth season is peak acting.
Bates Motel, na Record passa todo dia meia noite
Bates Motel,Vera Farmiga still scares me. I feel like she could snap at any given moment. Nestor Carbonell should be a leading man. Terrific performances all around on that show and it managed to be great or at least really solid throughout its entire run. That's hard to do.
Bates Motel,"I stopped watching halfway through season 2 for some reason and I've been meaning to actually finish watching it, apparently for 7 years."
Bates Motel,Great show!  Vera Farmiga is a MILF.
Bates Motel,Great show!  Vera Farmiga is a MILF.
Bates Motel,"Still need to continue season 3.... Vera is so talented, I love her. And Olivia 🥰🥰🥰"
Bates Motel,"Trash show. The seasons had only 10 episodes and still had fillers, just bad writing"
Bates Motel,NERMAN
Bates Motel,"I _really_ enjoyed this show. I do think it went on a little too long, but it was so entertaining to watch."
Bates Motel,Damn…. Time is flying
Bates Motel,"dont think about it like its prequel or else and you'll have great time.

as an loosely based adaptation its a decent show on its own with decent acting. vera, olivia and freddie are great to watch. and there is little rihanna too. on a iconic role."
Bates Motel,"Jesus fucking Christ, *ten goddamned years*. \[immediately crumbles to dust\]

...Anyway, this show really was kind of a small miracle, because by any measure, ""Prequel To Psycho Set In The Modern Day And Revolving Around Norman Bates' Teen Years (And Also He Has A Cool Older Brother Who Rides Around On A Motorcycle)"" sounds like the absolute worst thing imaginable. And yet the show, somehow, against all odds, was genuinely *good!* Highmore and Farmiga were superb, the writers seemed to have a real respect and appreciation for the source material without generally resorting to the sort of eye-rolling Hey-Remember-This-From-The-Film Easter eggs that usually plague this sort of endeavor, and even the Cool Older Brother Who Rides Around On A Motorcycle turned out to actually be a pretty good character. Kind of amazing, really."
Bates Motel,love this show. i will rewatch it at some point.
Bates Motel,The last two seasons were great and I remember being pretty satisfied with how the series ended.
Bates Motel,"Season 4 and 5 were amazing, like they got a new set of writers."
Bates Motel,Well I guess I don’t need to watch the show anymore…
Bates Motel,This show is based on Psycho. I thought everyone knew he kills. I’ll delete my comment but the show is worth watching for that season alone.
Bates Motel,"Give over, the entire premise of the show hinges on being aware of the end"
Bates Motel,"She really, really was. I first came across Vera when she was in The Departed. I saw a lot of the cast filming the movie ( I’m from Boston) so I was pumped when it came out. She was good in that, but didn’t really think of her again until I saw  The Orphan. She was pretty good in that. It wasn’t until Bates Motel (AMAZING show) that I realized how phenomenal she was was. Unreal performance. She is absolutely incredible. One of my favorite actresses, and I get pumped for anything she is in."
Bates Motel,"I really love her in everything she does. Even in Godzilla KOTM. Her character is an absolute mess, but I still found her....endearing...for some reason? I think the first thing I saw her in was Running Scared with Paul Walker, and she was good in that too. Also love her in The Conjuring movies as well, she and Patrick Wilson are so wonderful together. The Departed, Up in the Air, etc., just a long list of great roles."
Bates Motel,"Precisely because of what she brought to Norma, I’m reluctant on Psycho rewatches to think of her as I had before. Whether Norman’s mental illness manifesting itself in play performances of her makes her out to be more of tireless, jealous tyrant than she in fact was or if he’s willfully making her look bad out of resentment, it’s possible she wasn’t abusive. And yet, even the psychologist ends up fully believing it. If it’s untrue, what a damn shame she died at her son’s hands when all she did was love him. 

But none of this is to say I think it’s an issue with Psycho. I think the speculation to be had on the character of Norma is great. But Bates Motel acts as a wonderful side dish that reminds you not to be so hasty in passing judgment on her."
Bates Motel,She's phenomenal in basically everything
Bates Motel,That show was really *really* underrated. Vera was brilliant. So was Freddie Highmore. Holy crap was his character complex. I hope he has a brilliant career ahead of him.
Bates Motel,Yes and Norman also dam they are so creepy.
Bates Motel,"Such an underrated actress. I’m due a rewatch of that series, thanks for reminding me OP"
Bates Motel,I’ve been a huge fan of hers since The Departed and Running Scared
Bates Motel,I can't wait to see what she does as Livia Soprano in that upcoming movie.
Bates Motel,I always got my life when she screamed NORMAN!!
Bates Motel,Is this show worth watching in it's entirety?
Bates Motel,"I wasn’t sure how I felt about her in the beginning—not because of her acting which is incredible—but because her version isn’t the Mother Bates we were used to from the movie.

Instead of a shrill nag, she alternates between doting and nurturing to narcissistic outbursts. As the show went on, I think this characterization is even better than the original."
Bates Motel,Shes incredible in everything  she does!!
Bates Motel,One of the best shows ever.  Nailed it
Bates Motel,"She's also a great director, her film Higher Ground is phenomenal and never got the attention it deserved."
Bates Motel,I need to carry on watching this. I'm only up to the beginning of season three. The entire cast is impressive.
Bates Motel,I love Vera!!! By far my favorite actress! You know when she’s casted in a film it’s doomed to be phenomenal. Vera kills every roles she plays. I freaking love her. 😍
Bates Motel,I saw all of those movies as well and felt that same way. I wouldn't know how great of an actress she was had I not seen Bates Motel. I feel people need to just watch this show and it shows her true capabilities.
Bates Motel,Up in the air is an amazing movie.
Bates Motel,"I think there's a lot more to the performance than you are giving credit for. She's definitely painted in the show as having deep seeded psychological issues, and her relationship with Norman is absolutely inappropriate. It's just not as, no pun intended, black and white as it's alluded to in Psycho. 

She wasn't a child beating monster, but she definitely contributed to Norman's psychological issues throughout his life."
Bates Motel,"I fully respect your opinion and don't think you should have to re-watch Psycho if you don't feel you want to. 

I do however disagree. I see exactly what you mean when you say that you got the impression from the movie she was maybe some kind of drunken alcoholic Mother that had a really inappropriate relationship with her son, but I much prefer the way Bates Motel portrayed it.

In my opinion the portrayal of Norma was so good just because it is/was such a realistic approach to how someone would go down an unhealthy path. Most of her behavior towards Norman was verbal/emotional abusive and the fact that she also is very clearly mentally ill, made it fit well. 

I just overall think the approach was very well done and done in a way that doesn't make you second guess or think ""well that is bullshit."" I just felt through the entire show like it all fell into place."
Bates Motel,"The series blamed men for Bates. But the series was heavily fabricated from a brief novel.

But she could've tried harder to get him psychological help."
Bates Motel,"I agree. I also found that just about every actor in that show was great at what they did. It was interesting because, like you said, it was underrated, but it also was so well produced?

You'd think that it would be as big as a show like game of thrones with how good the acting was."
Bates Motel,"> I hope he has a brilliant career ahead of him.

His show The Good Doctor has been pretty successful on ABC. I think he has a great future ahead of him."
Bates Motel,Of course!
Bates Motel,"I saw that in theaters. She has a strong voice as a director, too."
Bates Motel,Hahaa!!!!
Bates Motel,"Seasons 1-3 are great and you really get a sense of the family dynamics, the town politics, and lots of creepiness along the way. Seasons 4-5 *shit hits the wall*.

Every actor on the show does well (although Freddie’s accent slips out a lot) but even though he’s the main character, Vera Farmiga is definitely the star of the show, like next-level acting from her."
Bates Motel,Absolutely! I just watched it and it’s definitely one of my favourite shows. It gets better each season. The acting and chemistry between Freddie and Vera is phenomenal.
Bates Motel,Her performance was amazing but I did feel the character was too unlikeable
Bates Motel,Yes she is!
Bates Motel,And she can sing! I was stunned at her rendition of Maybe This Time.
Bates Motel,"What I meant was before, I think we all readily assumed malice on her part. How Norma is characterized in the show, it’s absolutely not that. I wouldn’t call her abusive. Culpable? Yes, but not the direct cause."
Bates Motel,She had no boundaries. But Norman was a mess even in the flashback to his dad's death.
Bates Motel,"I see. I just felt they humanized Norma much more than I would've thought to do myself, I wasn't suggesting that she's blameless."
Bates Motel,"I'd venture to say that many people who liked GOT (with all due respect: I liked the first 3 seasons) weren't necessarily into the complex psychological plot scenarios and complex characters found on BM. 

GOT is great, don't get me wrong. But you *really* had to follow along closely with BM to catch all of what was layered into it. That's what made it so brilliant: it was a slow burner filled with tiny clues and brilliant acting, and ultimately there's some deeply fucked up shit that comes out in it that makes it what it really is: a horror story.

Edit: I was going to add that the weirdly incestuous relationship between Norma and Norman might have put some people off... and then I remembered Jamie raping his sister in the church over the body of their son Joffrey on Game of Thrones. That was actually when I bailed on that show."
Bates Motel,"Yes but that’s sort of the point. Even since the original, Norma was always meant to be a character who was manipulative, narcissistic, jealous, controlling, paranoid, irrationally reactionary, etc. (Or at least that is always how Norman perceived her)."
Bates Motel,We have no reason to believe she was significantly different before this incident.
Bates Motel,Nah I see what you mean for sure. I see exactly what you mean. I do find that many TV shows/movies find ways to humanize characters that probably don't deserve it.
Bates Motel,"Pretty sure you're tripping. The general consensus is that he did a fantastic job.

Also:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_awards_and_nominations_received_by_Freddie_Highmore"
Bates Motel,Hes suppose to be an awkward weird emotionless creepy kid who secretly wants to bang his mum and kill people
Bates Motel,"> Also the sexual tension between norman and his mom is... Really hard to watch

Do you...know what...*sigh* Are you aware of, isn't that the reason...

Bottom line I think the show just isn't for you."
Bates Motel,I mean... He was perfect for the role... Awkward... Weird...creepy eyebrows... Stiff body language ..
Bates Motel,"I feel like you should watch Psycho and it might make a lot more sense. If you've already seen Psycho, I don't think you will like it Bates Motel anymore if you keep watching it tbh."
Bates Motel,"Imagine thinking Freddie Highmore is a bad actor.

Also, what do you think you're supposed to be watching?"
Bates Motel,">It just feels like they grabbed a random kid that has no acting experience

Bro, they literally got Charlie from Tim Burton's Charlie and the Chocolate Factory."
Bates Motel,"No, I think he was pretty awesome in that role. 

The sexual tension is supposed to be hard to watch. 

It was a weird show, but good!"
Bates Motel,"Or maybe you don't know great acting when you see it...... And he's been acting for quite some time. Geez, have never seen Psycho? Or  heard of Ed Gein?  Chainsaw Massacre? All part of Ed Gein...from here my lovely state of WI. Maybe read the book."
Bates Motel,It got better the longer it was on
Bates Motel,Freddie Highmore.
Bates Motel,"It might be the awkwardness

I've only seen the first couple episodes and it's just every time he talks it sounds like someone told him to talk like it doesn't matter what you're saying just always end with an upward inflection or some shit"
Bates Motel,"No shit my guy lmao, doesn't mean it's not hard to watch"
Bates Motel,">The sexual tension is supposed to hard to watch. 

I realize that, I put it in my post because of how effective it is and as a way of discussion. For some reason you and some other guy thought I was complaining about it or something"
Bates Motel,"Can’t really blame us for misunderstanding since you put it right after saying Freddie Highmore is a bad actor and never said you thought it was effective.

I think the show is worth watching, but if his acting takes you out of the scene every time, maybe skip it. He’s in most of the scenes. The whole show hinges on him."
Bates Motel,"Usually when you say somethi g is ""God awful"" it's perceived as a complaint"
Bates Motel,"You're not being incredibly patronizing while trying to argue the same thing I just said though so I appreciate that lol

I do like the show so far. I really like the older brother and the mom's actress does a phenomenal job at acting bipolar, not sure if they touch on her medical diagnosis or not later in the show

It's just something about freddie's way of talking and voice that really gives me vibes of, I don't know how to explain it, not actually acting in the show type shit. It's not creepy or anything to me it's like he's just rehearsing lines and not acting if that makes sense. I noticed it seems better when his character shows more emotion, whether happy or angry.

Obviously I can tell I'm unique in this aspect from the reactions to this thread"
Bates Motel,You... Should probably re read the post
Bates Motel,I just reread the title. Again. What am I missing?
Bates Motel,"Ok, so where in that title is anything about the sexual tension? Lol"
Bates Motel,"are... are you replying to the right comment?

Your comment:
> For some reason you and some other guy thought I was complaining about it or something

Your title:
> is the kid that plays Norman a god awful actor?

What the fuck does sexual tension have to do with any of this?  Are you ok?"
Bates Motel,"Wait you're really going to start insulting me now LMAO

The comment chain you replied to was discussing sexual tension

The irony of you saying this

>are... are you replying to the right comment?

Is way too much lmao

Edit: https://imgur.com/a/M33QwEC

Do you see it yet or is cognitive dissonance in full effect?"
Bates Motel,"I wish you well in your journey learning the English language, my friend."
Bates Motel,"You're too funny my guy

In case you or anyone else is wondering, yes, that is exactly what cognitive dissonance looks like lmao"
Bates Motel,"I’m assuming you know the basic story of Psycho, so I think you’re fine watching Bates Motel first. If not, Bates Motel obviously has more of a chance to build the characters and the plot over 5 seasons, so I think I’d still start with that. While the show reaches the movie story wise they’re still completely different things so you can enjoy both.

The show is really great though and super unappreciated."
Bates Motel,They spoil each other. The show goes more in depth into things the movie covers with some slight differences.
Bates Motel,Either or. I dont think its too relevant for the narrative but obviously there's historical context. Watching old movies always fills in a lot of simpsons references I didn't get as a kid too.
Bates Motel,"It doesn't matter, they are both different enough that the show doesn't require any prior knowledge."
Bates Motel,"It's like Batman where it's all the same.

The original movie should be watched. The series is a prequel and a revamp of the movie."
Bates Motel,"No but you should watch Psych

I just realized they had a Harry Potter themed episode I somehow missed the first time around"
Bates Motel,"Im loving the show, the acting is amazing and so is the cinematography, definitely one of the best examples I've seen in tv when it comes to mental illness between the two of them. I knew the basic story but was sure about the mothers death. I had the movie spoiled yesterday saying she was poisoned with strychnine but in the show it was carbon monoxide, but I guess that doesn't matter since it's the same effect pretty much. What I didn't know is that she's dead the entire movie"
Bates Motel,"That's also why I'm confused because I had the movie spoiled yesterday listening to a podcast when the host mentioned a poison called strychnine but on the show it was carbon monoxide. I'm assuming in the movie you are to believe the mother is alive until it shows a sort of flashback or something since the show is supposed to be a sort of prequel, is the show supposed to be a separate entity or is it really a prequel?"
Bates Motel,"The movie takes place towards the end of the shows timeline, the show is basically an origin story/prequel."
Bates Motel,Separate continuity. Part of the final season retells the events of Psycho but changes some elements.
The Americans,"Yep. Awesome soundtrack, too."
The Americans,It is excellent the whole way through. My favorite show.
The Americans,"It’s a slow burn kind of show, but me and my wife absolutely loved the entire series!"
The Americans,Get ready to fall in love with the mail robot.
The Americans,absolutely. no other words.
The Americans,"It's a slow burner.  If you don't mind slow, then I highly recommend it.  It absolutely maintains its quality from start to finish."
The Americans,"One of the best shows I have ever watched, and never gets corny."
The Americans,Yes! One of my favorite shows!
The Americans,Worth every minute
The Americans,The series finale is a 10/10. The rest of the show is a 9/10. Do whatever you’d like with that information.
The Americans,"Americans is unique in a way that there are mostly no good guys or bad guys, just bunch of people doing what they think is right for their respective countries, its well written and even  better acted, i love it."
The Americans,"Warning:   This show requires you are not only paying attention, but are engaged with the material all episode, every episode.  It is complex, has a liberal amount of subtitles (not to mention subtext) and reading facial reactions and body language are essential to getting the most out of the show.  

I loved this show and even did a full rewatch.  But, be prepared to put away the phone or distractions, as it is not a “casual” watch."
The Americans,"YES. It is absolutely not my genre, but man is it great. Not every season is equally great, but there are no bad ones. Plus: Finally a show that didn't disappoint in it's ending."
The Americans,"Enjoyed it very much, truly."
The Americans,"Yes, it's really good and the ending is one of best I've seen for a show.   
Though it's a slow burn show and doesn't take you by the hand."
The Americans,probably the only consistently great show I've seen in the last decade alongside BCS and Bosch
The Americans,"Da, comrade [long drag off a cigarette] … da."
The Americans,Yes Matthew rhys and Keri Russell are amazing
The Americans,Fantastic show! Really enjoyed it!!
The Americans,Americans is a bit of a slow starter but one of the rare shows that peaks in the finale. Just got better and better as it went along. Definitely one of the finer series of the last decade.
The Americans,"It's one of the best shows of all time, in my opinion."
The Americans,"As someone who practically despised all the main characters, it’s absolutely worth watching. It’s very well done. It’s just hard to watch these pieces of shit live their despicable, monstrous lives.

Elizabeth Jennings is one of the most evil main characters ever portrayed on tv."
The Americans,"It is a steadily very good show the whole way through.  I also think it has one of my favorite finales.  I don't know that it's highs are as high as a Breaking Bad or The Wire, but it is consistently about an 8/10 show imo."
The Americans,It's one of the best shows of the last 10 years.
The Americans,"YES. I've seen every show you can think of, and after watching The Americans I instantly placed it in my top 3."
The Americans,Absolutely worth watching. I put it on the same level as Sopranos and Breaking Bad.
The Americans,One of my top ten shows ever. More people should should watch it.
The Americans,It’s excellent.
The Americans,"100%. There isn’t a bad episode, let alone a bad season. One of my all times favorites. Wish more people knew about it."
The Americans,Absolutely it’s great
The Americans,"Definitely 

It’s excellent.

It is one of the darker shows out there though."
The Americans,It was fully fucking sick. One of my all-time favorites. Honestly keeps getting better the whole series. I regret waiting to give it a shot. I should watch it now.
The Americans,"Me and my wife loved it enough that we recently discussed watching it again.  She’s usually not into these types of shows but was willing to watch because of Keri Russell, then she was captured."
The Americans,The Americans is amazing and one of my top ten must watch shows!
The Americans,"The Americans is peak tv. One of the best series ever and it ends perfectly. Have fun, and good luck."
The Americans,"I'm not sure how helpful threads like these are. In general, you're only going to hear from the people that absolutely love the show, and then you'll also hear from a small subsection that hates it. The middle won't even open the thread.

That being said, I adore the show from start to finish."
The Americans,"Hard to say, i hear a lot fo people rave about it, but i've tried multiple time to watch and fizzle out after a few seasons. 

So it's really more of a give it a ty and see if it fits you."
The Americans,"People keep calling it ""slow"" ? Its completely invested in allowing the viewer to learn everything about the characters, I find this fascinating, and would never refer to it as ""slow"". Its refreshingly lacking in explosions and *cartoonish*, gratuitous violence."
The Americans,"A lot of people say it's great but I personally didn't care for it. I watched most of the first season and got pretty bored with a lot of the subplots and found it increasingly difficult to suspend my disbelief about the massive bodycount they rack up and the stupidity of the American authorities in the show. If you are looking for an espionage thriller that is grounded in reality and history, this isn't it, in my opinion.

I'm sure if I stuck with it would have found aspects of it quite compelling as a more general drama, but it didn't seem worth my time, personally."
The Americans,*Is one of the greatest television programs of all time worth watching?*......well yeah probably.....
The Americans,Great series....I grew to hate one of the main characters... great writing and great acting
The Americans,It’s definitely slow - I gave up on it but the majority of people here rave about how good it is if you stick with it.
The Americans,"They pulled in this aviation geek by having a whole season about the development of Tacit Blue (precursor/testbed for the now-famous F-117 stealth “fighter”)

Kept me in because Matthew Rhys and Keri Russell are so damn compelling to watch."
The Americans,Yeah it’s fantastic
The Americans,Absolutely excellent television. One of the few shows completely worth the investment of time and attention.
The Americans,"There is a pretty stupid plot development near the end of the show, but otherwise it is very good."
The Americans,Yes!
The Americans,Yes.
The Americans,"yes

very much so"
The Americans,Absolutely! It's awesome tv!
The Americans,Very much so.  Enjoy!
The Americans,"Starts a little slow and repetitive but, picks up in season 2."
The Americans,"I rate it highly, one of the best shows imo"
The Americans,Yes. It is in my top tier of Television.
The Americans,Definitely!
The Americans,Hell yeah. The whole double life thing is well done.
The Americans,One of my favorite television experiences ever. 10/10 would recommend
The Americans,Amazing show. Loosely based on actual events.
The Americans,Yes.
The Americans,Oh hell yes
The Americans,Yes.
The Americans,"Great show, worth a binge session during a cold winter"
The Americans,"Yep, excellent show from start to finish"
The Americans,Great show
The Americans,Yes !  One of the best imho.
The Americans,"It’s definitely worth it, and the last season is incredible"
The Americans,YES
The Americans,"Excellent, from start to finish.  One of the best finales in TV history."
The Americans,"It’s a lot like breaking bad in a way that you find yourself really rooting for characters who are also very, very bad people. You feel happy and excited when Phillip and Elizabeth escape from something even though they’re Russian agents trying to destroy the country while killing lots of innocent civilians"
The Americans,"it's a TV show, not a mortgage. watch the first episode. if it's good enough, you'll wanna watch the next one. no amount of evangelising will replace watching the show and finding out"
The Americans,"Easily the best series finale of any show I’ve ever watched. I the penultimate episode was great. The finale was great. Each season is long, and sometimes drags on too much. Part of a cable TV show, not built for binging. Took me about a year to watch it all. No regrets."
The Americans,Yes it's a great show with a really well done ending
The Americans,I am obsessed. I started while I need to study for a test and I cant stop. It is written so well
The Americans,I was home after a surgery and decided to give it a go cause I had time to kill. It is fantastic
The Americans,Yes. Loved the Americans
The Americans,Yes! 100% yes
The Americans,I'm not sure if there has ever even been a better film about spycraft. And definitely no TV series came close to this one.
The Americans,One of the only shows I’ve seen keep it’s quality until the end. Which is impressive for a six season show.
The Americans,It does... if anything the 1st season is the one that is generally considered to be the worst.
The Americans,It’s pretty good but the first is a SLOW AS FUCK burn. Just so you know.
The Americans,Started watching it because Keri Russell was in it. Stayed because the storyline was so good.
The Americans,"I'll say something controversial - the acting is good, the characters arcs not so much. It all builds up to... nothing. 
To me it felt like a missed opportunity, much like Lost."
The Americans,Slow burn. Kinda boring. Tried twice. Might try once more but not sold yet
The Americans,"I couldn’t finish the first season. Every single episode was the same where the main characters would go back and forth on how they loved each other, no wait, they hate each other, no wait they actually do love each other! Until the next episode. Where the cycle repeated.

It got really obnoxious as the season went on."
The Americans,We tried for a while tgen gave up on it. Not my cup of tea.
The Americans,I just sorta gave up around the 4th season. I was watching it and then it just dawned on me that I didn’t care about what happens to any of them
The Americans,"Yep, loved it."
The Americans,Yes
The Americans,My favorite part is that the spycraft is actually believable and doesn't break down with the slightest amount of scrutiny.
The Americans,It's fantastic for the first three seasons but really slows down after that. The later seasons are harder to slog through. Definitely not a bingeable show imo but it's quite good.
The Americans,Yes but I definitely think it's overhyped. Probably a C+ overall for me.
The Americans,"Meh.

I started the show with the title characters as the protaginists and the ""people to root for"" in mind. Sure they were spying for a shit country, but their situation is what it is and they have to play along, they don't have much choice. The antagonist, the main guy trying to catch them, is quite the asshole, so the roles are clear.

However at some point the things the protagonists do such unapologetically evil stuff that there's no rooting for them anymore. I just wished they'd get caught and thrown in prison for life, or executed. Yet the show still tries to depict them (that is purely subjective) as the good guys, or guys to follow, or the guys to sympathize with. I found myself thinking ""why watch horrible people do horrible things, fuck them"" and stopped watching.

I usually don't have to root for somebody and think this sentiment is silly, but in this case I lost interest. The protagonists didn't really hold my interest enough to go along with this ride."
The Americans,"I've never seen it. The thing that put me off was rooting for the Russians against America...or is it not like that? I don't know, everyone seems to love it so I'll give it a try at some point to see how I feel about it."
The Americans,"I watched the first episode with my wife, and we turned it off because of the rape scene in the beginning. If that’s what you’re showing in the very beginning, how many more times will you show it throughout the series. 

Ugh…"
The Americans,"I couldn’t get into it… I found their relationship so frustrating, not believable, and it kind of ruined it for me. The plot was fine but I couldn’t get into the characters at all."
The Americans,Nope. It turns into a crappy soap opera after like season 2
The Americans,I didn't enjoy it. Very silly.
The Americans,Loved it.
The Americans,Hell yeah
The Americans,"It’s the sleeping giant next to sopranos, mad men, and bb/Saul. One of the best shows ever written"
Marvels Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,"Holy shit, the special effects look phenomenal! Looks like they were actually given a budget this season, unlike last year. Can't wait!"
Marvels Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,"Well...that was different.  I guess no Avenger's tie-in which is disappointing since the Captain America twist was amazing forever ago.  Still, should be a fun season and zero worry of cancellation."
Marvels Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,"With the parallel universe Coulson and everything 

Can we maybe get Ward back?"
Marvels Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,"If they're going extra Spacey, seems like they're setting up SWORD"
Marvels Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,"So, they're dimension hoppers who are hunting Deke because he's a time remnant. Nice.

Also, Agent Davies gets TWO lines!"
Marvels Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,"I'm a little disappointed that ended up being a Coulson doppelganger and not actually Phil. 

And this is probably more one of their ""thematic"" tie-ins. Like season 4, where there was no direct crossover, but the season was all magic related, like Dr. Strange. And now we have an alternate timeline Phil crossing over. To which I won't be specific about regarding spoilers."
Marvels Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,"What's awesome about this is they only really showed one of the storylines this season. We know Space Team is looking for Fitz and is likely going to be tangling with the Kree guy from last season.

The AoS writers always know how to use their runtime correctly."
Marvels Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,Looks pretty awesome! Man Daisy looks unrecognizable tho
Marvels Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,Did someone say INCREASED BUDGET?
Marvels Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,oooo Chloe's hair. Vava voom.
Marvels Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,Well that was a helluva thing. I'm very excited for this to *finally* be back on the air!
Marvels Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,"lol slow linkinpark cover, never thought I'd hear something like that. I have a softspot for agents of shield so I'll definitely check this out."
Marvels Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,Can someone remind me what happened to Fitz?
Marvels Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,So why doesn't the evil version of Coulson have a goatee?
Marvels Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,[deleted]
Marvels Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,"Holy shit, I forgot the new season starts in a week!!! I thought it was in June or July for some reason. So HYPE."
Marvels Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,Woah this looks like a movie trailer. Crazy
Marvels Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,damn i need to rewatch season 5
Marvels Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,"Culson looks bad ass a a villain. Really interested in know the who/why part of all of that.

What sucks is I have no way to watch AoS until it's seasons hit Netflix. fucking RIP"
Marvels Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,So Coulson is basically Galactus?
Marvels Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,I'm confused. I thought Clark Gregg had decided to leave the series.
Marvels Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,"Reading some of the comments on here, makes me think i should catch up on the show."
Marvels Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,ABC puts pop up ads on their ads for their shows. Right on.
Marvels Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,Does anyone know where to watch s6 for free (not Netflix or abc) and is non cam?
Marvels Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,NEEDS MORE FITZ
Marvels Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,hype!
Marvels Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,I honestly thought this already aired and was waiting for it to come to Netflix.
Marvels Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,Called it at the end of last season. Deke didn’t vanish.
Marvels Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,"Dammit, are they going to ""Ward"" Coulson forever now?"
Marvels Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,"Sky look, different, to anyone else? (Save for the haircut)"
Marvels Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,Going to be confusing having Quake with lighter hair than Simmons.
Marvels Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,0:23 I think I’ve been looking at too much porn
Marvels Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,I’m glad the show finally realizes that it will never be part of the movie making it its own thing.
Marvels Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,How does this show tie in to anything MCU at this point!
Marvels Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,"When will they learn that a global threat isn't interesting? ""Oh no I do wonder if the villain will succeed in his goal to *literally destroy the planet*"""
Marvels Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,"Well I am out of the loop. Lots of space stuff and I like this version of Coulson. Is this the final season? Because if it is I can wait and binge where I left off, which seems like a while ago."
Marvels Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,WOW!!! this new season looks awesome!  i like the twist on having Coulson (or a Coulson lookalike) being the antagonist! Daisy is always gorgeous but i'm not in love with her blonde hair.
Marvels Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,So is he a Skrull now? Timeline wise when does this take place? Should the finale just be the group being snapped? How do they explain the fact that in this cataclysmic world ending event they aren’t getting help from any of the avengers?
Marvels Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,"Yeah I already loved this show, then they added Bear McCreary (Battlestar Galactica, The Walking Dead) for the music and now they actually get a budget! I'm so happy for them!"
Marvels Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,"So basically Alt Coulson is part of Marvel's Legends of Tomorrow? I feel like Deke is a time anomaly and will cause the destruction of the planet somehow so they have to eliminate him? Anyway, can't wait!"
Marvels Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,Cloe Bennet has some facework done. She was so pretty. So angry about this.
Marvels Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,[deleted]
Marvels Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,Should I watch this show? How does it compare to other shows?
Marvels Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,"First thought: SHIELD is still on??

Second thought: Holy shit, I need to catch up – this looks awesome!"
Marvels Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,Anyone know who does that Linkin Park cover?
Marvels Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,"Is this show any good?

I watched the first two episodes and thought it sucked.

But it's still on the air so must be doing something right.

Thoughts?"
Marvels Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,Leak this Linkin Park cover
Marvels Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,Nice cameo by Pasadena (or Pawnee) City Hall at 0:44.
Marvels Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,"Anyone know of a good video that recaps season 5?

It's been so long, I honestly forget a lot that happened."
Marvels Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,"Chloe bennet is the best thing about this show by far, and this trailer looks amazing"
Marvels Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,I feel like I’m the only person that thinks this looks horrible
Marvels Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,Let’s fucking go!
Marvels Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,Awesome!
Marvels Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,I stopped watching when Sky found her mom and she got powers. Everything got really... what’s the word.
Marvels Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,"Production looks amazing!! But,they're at it again... Made Ward and Fitz the bad guys and ran the entire season...now its Coulson. Looks like they're running out of story"
Marvels Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,I don't think I'm going to watch. I think i'm just... over it... I've watched all the seasons up till this point and I just don't care any more
Marvels Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,"I've never watched this show, so I have nothing against it but I think it's time we stop with these awful overproduced covers of old pop songs as though some autotuned sad girl whispering linkin park is a legitimate expression of a melancholy mood. 

Can we fast forward to the day we all look back on this somehow ubiquitous trend in trailers and laugh about it?"
Marvels Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,"Goddamn this looks bad. 

Do people actually enjoy this show?"
Marvels Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,"Are there still bad guys in this universe? I mean, with the ending of Endgame. The fuck does anyone stand a chance."
Marvels Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,[deleted]
Marvels Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,i didnt know this show was still on. i was super hyped when it came out but it was like any other watered down detective style show and the acting was awful. After the hydra stuff i completely lost interest as the story felt like it was going nowhere. It looks like they kept the terrible actors. Did the show get any better?
Marvels Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,"I love how comic book TV and movies continue to make EVERY MISTAKE that the comics made before them but worse, instead of improving on it. 

I especially love the unearned pathos of fake deaths and multiple timelines/dimensions now made even more meaningless by the shorter timeframe."
Marvels Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,"Excellent song choice for be trailer. Despite how long it’s run and the perceived quality of the show, nothing that’s happened has really mattered to the real MCU"
Marvels Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,[removed]
Marvels Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,It always looked good for a network show. For instance I think everyone agreed that they nailed the look of Ghost Rider in season 4.
Marvels Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,"SHIELD has always had an incredible special effects team so seeing them with what appears to be a better budget has me totally hyped. 

This trailer has me so hyped. I love the direction they're going and the show's willingness to constantly evolve is one of its greatest strengths."
Marvels Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,Last year they also had to do 22 episodes but for this and S7 it's only 13 so that saved some money effects wise.
Marvels Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,"The bump in the FX is because of a longer time in the oven, not a bump in the budget.  Technically speaking, this is probally the least expensive season of the show because they cut it in half, delayed it a long while and removed episodes."
Marvels Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,"I think part of it was that ABC was done with AoS, and Disney / Marvel came down and made them make more (and not only more, announce a Season 7 way early). And in exchange, provided a larger budget for it."
Marvels Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,"Absolutely, even though they had no money for last season‘s series, they still did and amazing job with the storyline. Setting it under ground was such a brilliant move to save them money."
Marvels Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,"A little TIL lesson in lingo, special effects are practical effects that happen on set and captured in camera. Visual effects are the computer generated effects layered on top of the previously captured scenes or complete VFX scenes themselves.

Marvels Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,"They've had way more than their usual 2-3 months to work on the CGI this season, so it should look pretty good."
Marvels Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,"> [spoiler](#s ""AoS producers indicated this season takes 1 year after their Season 5 & Infinity War. That was meant to give the show breathing room from the cliffhanger events of the film, but that was before everyone learned about the 5 year time jump from Endgame. The Season 6 episode that was previewed seemingly made no mention of the Snap at all. So, these are the possibilities: 1) Marvel Studios really didn't let Marvel TV production know anything, so AoS will not make sense / connect with MCU films anymore. A strange tact because Marvel Studios / Disney have gone out of their way to help the show out (and prevent cancellation) and never stated we're cutting them off 2) AoS will make show some reference to the fact half of everyone was gone, but not really focus on it (since their main characters survived). Funny enough, this works because as the seasons went on, AoS was filmed in more contained / claustrophobic areas because it was clear they couldn't afford a ton of extras (city street scenes looked abandoned). They could use this as an excuse to film outside more because since half of everyone is gone, they don't need that many extras 3) The 1 year later is a fake-out and this takes place 5 years later "")"
Marvels Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,"> [spoiler](#s ""I heard AoS is only 1 year timejump from the finale of last season"")"
Marvels Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,No. Stop doing tie ins. The show got good when they stopped trying to be a companion piece of the films and just focused on telling their own stories.
Marvels Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,"I don't know, I really liked how the gave us good-guy Ward in the Framework. That felt like a good send-off for the actor and character."
Marvels Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,I thought the same thing since they've managed to have Ward back in just about every season 1 way or another.
Marvels Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,Ward came back like 3 times already lol
Marvels Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,As long as it is Evil Ward again. I loved Evil Ward so much. He had so much fun being the bad guy and it showed.
Marvels Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,I'll die if he's the one who ends up saving Fitz
Marvels Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,THERES EVEN A SWORD IN THE TRAILER!
Marvels Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,I think most shows and movies are trying not to have any Spacey anymore after everything that came out about him. ^^/s
Marvels Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,Thought it meant having Kevin Spacey.
Marvels Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,What is SWORD?
Marvels Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,Oh please no. Saved SWORD for the movies.
Marvels Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,"I swear they already said they were going to do SWORD now that Captain Marvel is around. Maybe not _with_ Captain Marvel, but the story tie ins like they did with Winter Soldier, Thor, Age of Ultron, and a few others would be possible.

I honestly thought we were getting SWORD after the final scene of S4 with Coulson in space. Was mildly disappointed we didn't (I ended up liking the direction they went)"
Marvels Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,I could have sworn i saw this EXACT same comment in the other thread lol
Marvels Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,lol i know you're trying to prevent spoilers but i feel like anyone could put two and two together from your comment
Marvels Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,"I think this is the only storyline.  Its only 13 episodes this season, not 22."
Marvels Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,Looked super similar to Dichen Lachman in that hallway scene
Marvels Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,she's really starting to look like the actress who played her mom in the show with that lol
Marvels Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,"Yeah, that made me double take."
Marvels Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,She's the Black Widow of the TV shows
Marvels Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,It's been pretty big lately. Magic The Gathering's recent trailer got a lot of mileage out of it.
Marvels Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,They played one for the alita battle angel trailer. Was a pretty dope cover
Marvels Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,Yeah the slow soft covers of rock songs with female vocals  over trailers seems to be popular right now.

Liv and Maddie,[deleted]
Liv and Maddie,I’ve only seen clips of young Sheldon but I like bbt so maybe I should try it.
Liv and Maddie,"Sort of. It's more about character development that's consistent throughout the series. There are character arcs and a premise for the series but it's pretty episodic story-wise. It's kind of hard to explain. But it's 100% worth it in my opinion. Starts out like a traditional sitcom, albeit a well written one, but near the end of Season 1 and onward it becomes the most unique comedy I've ever seen. It's my favorite comedy of all time."
Liv and Maddie,"What I love about Letterkenny and why its such a comfort show for me is it has such great repeat viewing. Like Always Sunny or Office, its a cast of mischievous goofballs who you just grow to love and there are so many witty little moments in the dialogue that you won’t catch the first time. I’ve actually been watching it recently with subtitles because they throw soo much at you and its been phenomenal. Only thing I’ll say is compared to Office or Always Sunny, there’s way less episodes to love. But they seem to churn out seasons pretty quickly (only 6-7 eps a season though) so thats cool."
Liv and Maddie,Letterkenny is great but it takes a bit of watching to pay off.
Liv and Maddie,"Yes, I find it better than the BBT in my personal opinion. We are getting more towards the affair with the end of Season 4 last and starting to see more Missy-Sheldon moments that show why Sheldon likes his sister better than his brother. Highly recommend, renewed through Season 7 so lots more to discover about Sheldons past"

Liv and Maddie,"The Walking Dead. Yes, the show gets a lot of flack here and yes the writing can be really inconsistent and the character behave irrationally.

However, among all the crap there are little pieces of greatness which shine through. I still freak out when a dude gets thrown into a furnace and there are a lot of great preformances from the cast. I definitely watch it religiously every week."
Liv and Maddie,"Greys Anatomy. I really don't like it, but every couple of months I find myself pining to watch it-and then I'll watch like 12 episodes in one night "
Liv and Maddie,"I rarely watch reality TV but... I enjoyed or should I say - laughed at Jersey Shore. Never told anyone I watch it.

Also, 90 Day Fiance was great for 2 seasons."
Liv and Maddie,Timeless. It's goofy and the time travel is full of holes but I really like it. There's just something about them hopping to different time periods and meeting all kinds of historical figures that just works for me. It's dumb but super fun.
Liv and Maddie,"The Bachelor. I hate it so much. Also, I love it. "

Liv and Maddie,Probably Lucifer.  The premise is so silly but I find myself liking it anyway.
Liv and Maddie,"Grimm. I really enjoy watching. And in my opinion keeps getting better. Guilty pleasure because describing the show to others is silly. Also it is often compared to Supernateral and in my experience die hard fans reject grimm. Bitch, you can watch both."
Liv and Maddie,"I am fucking in love with liv and Maddie, its great and I will hunt down and verbally reprimand anyone who says otherwise"

Liv and Maddie,Is that really a guilty pleasure? I find it very good show.
Liv and Maddie,"Rupaul's Drag Race is legit, don't feel guilty. "
Liv and Maddie,That's why I watch a lot of the shows I listed besides Scream Queens and Ghost Adventures. They're all light hearted shows where you don't have to think too much. You can sit back and watch an episode without getting lost or confused by the plot. 
Liv and Maddie,"Your husband is missing out, I love Scrubs"
Liv and Maddie,Is that any good? I've been thinking about starting it on Netflix but I don't know if I can binge that many seasons. 
Liv and Maddie,I used to watch Jersey Shore all the time when no one else was home. one time I ended up watching a marathon of it because I was watching my grandma's dog and there was nothing else on. 
Liv and Maddie,I'm actually trying to watch that but I've been busy with work and I haven't had any time. 
Liv and Maddie,"Funny how there was a time when Arrow was a better show than Agents and all it took was a few years to completely flip that around. Like you, the CW's DC shows are my guilty pleasure at this point. "

Liv and Maddie,"It's an EXTREMELY good show... for what it is. Which is to say that it is basically Kubrickian if you're comparing it to typical network dramas like Hawaii Five-O or NCIS: wherever.

It pales in comparison to practically every cable drama, though."
Liv and Maddie,"One Tree Hill? I personally love it. It's basically a situational drama where you might end up thinking, ""how the hell would all this shit happen to the same group of people"" but I think that is intentional to kind of give the audience the directors/producers/creators views on certain situations. Plus the overarching theme is fantastic. "

Liv and Maddie,"The funny thing is though, I grew up on Nickelodeon. I just like GMW and Liv and Maddie. "
Liv and Maddie,I've been watching since the very first season. Somehow it never gets old to me! I love it
Liv and Maddie,"Nickelodeon has declined so much in quality though, have you seen the stuff they air now? Ugh"
Liv and Maddie,"No, Nickelodeon sucks now. "
Sons of Anarchy,"I thought the show was good, at times great, in the first 5 seasons, but completely collapsed in 6 and 7 when Kurt Sutter turned the violence all the way up and began padding out every episode to be damn near an hour long.  Literally 3/4 of season 7 is spent on a shitty wild goose chase about who killed Tara, and Jax is too dumb to figure out that Gemma was behind it, like she was behind everything else in the entire run of the series prior to that."
Sons of Anarchy,"I can't help to think of the horrendous cgi with Jax in the end.

The show was stretched out too much, solid start that overstayed it's welcome."
Sons of Anarchy,"I enjoyed the first 2 and a half seasons but after that I felt the story, writing, pacing of the show just got fucked. 
Besides maybe Chibbs and Bobby, every member is either full on pants on head retarded or causing more problems to fix their problems.

Jax is an idiot for not seeing Gemma killed Tara.  Clay lived way past his due date.  The whole cartel/Fbi thing in season 4 was the thing that really made me role my eyes since it made the whole season feel moot.

And finally those sappy, shitty, 5 minute montages that was added to every episode in the finale.  Maybe they should have gotten a few lessons from Breaking Bad."
Sons of Anarchy,"SoA was a show that i loved to death when i watched it... Although i also was a 17 years old at the time who thought the show was mature and deep for showing violence. I rewatched it recently, and boi it wasn't as good as i remember.

I think it's pretty hit or miss: S1 and S2 are great, S3 is a slog for the most part, S4 and the first 3 episodes of S5 are the peak of the show for me (yeah, even with the CIA/Cartel twist; it was a cop out no doubt about it, but whatever), but then the rest of the show ranks from mediocre to terrible (the rest of S5, S6 and most of S7 are awful and boring for the most part; once Jax finds out the truth towards the last 4 episodes of S7 though? the show recovers a lot into a decent ending). So yeah, i don't think the show is really good; but i had fun times while watching it so i don't regret it.

My biggest complains are pretty much the same that what people already said here: a LOT of filler (pointless romances, characters that only appeared for a couple episodes and then disappeared without any lasting effects on the show, pointless drama, etc); and the characters acting stupid for the sake of the plot."
Sons of Anarchy,"Watch The Mayans, which is a SoA spin-off, and you might get your wish.

It's up through S2 as of now. Don't know when S3 will air, just that it was likely to be 2020 before the shit hit the fan."
Sons of Anarchy,"After a couple seasons of that show I realized it's basically a soap opera, and I felt like I'd been tricked lol. Still finished it though, but damn if it isn't ridiculous."
Sons of Anarchy,The show went from no body snitches to everybody snitches. All the people who died in the last season was so satisfying to see go.
Sons of Anarchy,Show sucked really bad after Ireland.  I don't know what they were smoking?
Sons of Anarchy,"I enjoyed the first two seasons, grew tired of it in the 3rd and dumped it in the 4th.

It did have a bunch of great covers and slow rolling music videos."
Sons of Anarchy,Good god that show was so corny
Sons of Anarchy,I enjoyed sons of anarchy a lot. I did like the shield far more but sons was still really good. It had some low points like any show but I actually enjoyed the ending. Unlike shows like game of thrones which the last 3 seasons were horrible. Or dexter and that atrocious ending to an otherwise amazing series. I think sons did a great job and had a great cast where you were able to like many of the characters not just the main protagonist.
Sons of Anarchy,I think we can all agree the intro aged pretty poorly
Sons of Anarchy,"Katie Sagan had one of the best lines in history talking to an obnoxious soccer mom while dropping off the kids at school: (very calm voice) “ if you honk that horn one more time I’m going to shove that cup up your ass so far you’ll be shittin macchiatos for a week”. Courtney Love had a cameo and said something like”oh, Grammys gots temper”. Great show."
Sons of Anarchy,"Show only had 1 great season (Season 2 is excellent), 1-2 good seasons and then the rest was mediocre to poor."
Sons of Anarchy,Charlie hunnams accent is terrible in this show.
Sons of Anarchy,[deleted]
Sons of Anarchy,Season 4 was the peak.
Sons of Anarchy,"Eh the show was always pretty violent from day one(that one guy getting his tattoo burned off was every bit as nasty as the stuff in later seasons) so I wasn't too bothered by the later seasons in that regard.

I could buy that Jax wouldn't suspect Gemma because even though he's had arguments with her, the thought of her killing was wife was likely far beyond the pale for him to comprehend, I don't think that made him dumb necessarily.

I actually didn't mind the longer episodes, for me they flew right by and I appreciated that Sutter got the chance to add more stuff in.

I actually liked the idea of Jax going on a misguided rampage as it's not something i've ever seen in a TV show before, it was definitely a unique take.  At first I wasn't sure whether to root for Jax or not, but when Lin's men killed all those escorts I was like ""yeah fuck this guy, kill him!"""
Sons of Anarchy,I genuinely didn't notice that was CGI.
Sons of Anarchy,"I enjoyed the montages myself, I thought they were a nice effective way of getting info across without tons of expository dialogue.

I'll admit I was at first dissapointed that Clay didn't die sooner but I grew to actually get interested in him again after he got demoted and then stripped of his patch and almost felt bad for him by the end.

I liked the CIA twist and it was foreshadowed at least a few times so it wasn't totally out of nowhere like some people think(I.E. the guys that attempted to ""kidnap"" Tara speaking perfect English and not looking very Mexican at all).

Personally i'm sick of people comparing EVERY single drama show to Breaking Bad, yes it's a great show but expecting every other drama to be like it is just unrealistic.  I'll be honest I was turned off from watching BB for the longest time purely because I was so sick of hearing critics orgasming over BB and then using that as an excuse to take a gigantic dump all over other dramas and the incredibly obnoxious BB fanbase that can't stop mentioning the show all the time and does stupid things like toss pizzas on top of the house that Walt did in the show(which naturally made things more difficult for the residents in that neighborhood were just trying to live their lives)to the point where even Vince Gilligan was ashamed of them and said they weren't ""real fans""(and I agree with him) for doing things like that.

I really liked Happy and Tig for their dark humor(and I liked that Tig ended up with Venus, that scene with the two of them talking in the dark in the bedroom was one of the most effective scenes in the show IMO) and I liked Juice for him going from butt-monkey to tragic figure(I felt so bad for him when he attempted suicide)"
Sons of Anarchy,"Yeah I definitely want to see Mayans, shame about Sutter's exit and i'm definitely interested to see how different season 3 will be without Sutter at the helm."
Sons of Anarchy,[deleted]
Sons of Anarchy,"I don't think I've ever seen an episode of SoA. I had a bad experience watching 'Scandal', only to find out that I had gotten invested in a ""soap"" without knowing it.

If I ever watch SoA, I think I'll go in thinking of it as an ""Action Soap"", and I feel like I wont be wrong. The Shield and Vikings I feel a little similar about. Melodrama. (Doesn't mean I think any of these shows are bad.)"
Sons of Anarchy,"I don't agree, I like the intro(and I thought it was cool how they changed the theme when they went to Ireland in season 3) song."
Sons of Anarchy,I thought people considered season 3 the worst because of the extended trip to Ireland and the whole plot involving Abel's kidnapping.
Sons of Anarchy,">Personally i'm sick of people comparing EVERY single drama show to Breaking Bad, yes it's a great show but expecting every other drama to be like it is just unrealistic.

I agree to the obnoxious fans that did that, but I really wasn't comparing both shows.  Just how the montages could be handled better.  I personally felt Sons of Anarchy's were just stitched together very poorly, not edited that well and went on far to long, especially in the final season.  It just felt like filler.  Compared to say in [Better Call Saul](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9L-7OHnKp9E) where they take Kim calling acquaintances to find a mega client to get out of the filing room and makes it fun and exciting, in my opinion. 

> I liked Juice for him going from butt-monkey to tragic figure(I felt so bad for him when he attempted suicide)

After the whole plot line of Juice doing stupid shit to cover up he's half black?  Only for it to not matter...  That was really hard to watch.  

>I liked the CIA twist and it was foreshadowed at least a few times so it wasn't totally out of nowhere like some people think(I.E. the guys that attempted to ""kidnap"" Tara speaking perfect English and not looking very Mexican at all).

Honestly, I probably missed it from being so bored and annoyed with the characters.  I watched with other friends and they semi-liked it but I really ended up kind of hate watching it."
Sons of Anarchy,"Yeah I heard, it's interesting that the protagonist of Mayans starts out as a prospect, i'm interested to see him slowly rise through the ranks."
Sons of Anarchy,"I feel you. I found Scandal intolerable ( I couldn't stand that damn camera shutter sound effect), but SoA was definitely watchable."
Sons of Anarchy,"To each their own. I just think,it looks cheesy. Really dates the show"
Sons of Anarchy,"I thought Sons had some cool and exciting montages, like the one at the end of Red Rose.

I liked Juice's sub-plot as it gave him some much needed character development.

I never understood the concept of hate-watching personally, if I hate something I just don't bother with it period, for me that would be Game of Thrones and Mad Men, neither of those shows did anything for me so I just stopped watching them period and never looked back."
Sons of Anarchy,Does not feel dated to me.
Sons of Anarchy,"It was kind of the first show/last show I ever did it on if that makes it any better?

I dropped Game of Thrones during season 3, How I met your mother around season 5, Dexter mid season 5.  So I can honestly say Sons was the only thing I pushed through as I would watch it with friends.  

I also was being a little embellished,  I definitely don't hate all the montages in Sons.  It just got a little redundant at times, especially near the end."
Sons of Anarchy,do you have a chain wallet and wear tap out shirts
Sons of Anarchy,"You made the right choice with HIMYM, terrible series finale, thankfully the series box set had a better alternate ending.

I've heard bad things about Dexter's last few seasons but i'm still curious to check the show out.

Other prestige dramas i'm interested in seeing:

Terriers

Generation Kill

Over There

Lilyhammer

Brotherhood

Banshee

The Killing

Bosch

Longmire

Ozark

Justified

The Americans

Southland

True Detective

Narcos

Leverage

Burn Notice

Strike Back

The Bridge

Fargo

The Following

Ray Donovan"
Sons of Anarchy,"What's a tap out shirt?  Never heard of it, and no to the chain wallets."
Sons of Anarchy,"Great list!  I currently have Generation Kill, The Americans on my ""to watch list"", while I have been currently watching Strike Back (just started season 3!)

The Killing, Fargo, True Detective, Justified are all just so amazing!

If you loved Banshee, have you had the chance to check out Warrior by the same creator?  Just as good if not better.  Though it seems almost any show that comes out from Cinemax is full of awesome.  Sucks they cancelled all original programming.  

Some of my favorites are: The Wire, Mr Robot, Better Call Saul, The Leftovers, The OA and It's always Sunny in Philadelphia.

The first 3 from that list are my all time favorites though."
Sons of Anarchy,Saw the Wire last year and really liked it.  Better Call Saul also looks great.
Sons of Anarchy,"He was in 100s of TV shows over the course of his career. 

RIP."
Sons of Anarchy,Clay did it.
Sons of Anarchy,"We all do damage. Character is determined  by how we repair it- Piney

Best Line in SOA."
Sons of Anarchy,"""Rocky! Be thou not afraid! No harm will come to thee.""

&#x200B;

I never knew this actor's name, but I immediately recognized him from his appearance on the X-Files in Jose Chung's From Outer Space, a very memorable part in a classic episode.   Looking at others' responses he had a long and varied career."
Sons of Anarchy,Wow 80?! Where has time gone? RIP
Sons of Anarchy,"Piney! Furel!

Those actually would've been the two roles I would've immediately thought of, though he was in a ton of stuff."
Sons of Anarchy,Dude looked great in that picture from the SOA premiere and he was 68.
Sons of Anarchy,"Fuck....


RIP. He was the best in samcro."
Sons of Anarchy,I cut down a tree for him and his wife when I was doing landscaping and tree trimming in high school. He was a really really nice guy and his wife was so sweet as well. Once we felled the tree they came out with big plates of sandwiches and gatorades and we sat down together and had lunch. Treated me and my coworkers with so much respect and kindness. RIP to a great guy.
Sons of Anarchy,"Piney was one of those characters you just knew wouldn’t go gentle into that good night. Just a cursed family, it seemed."
Sons of Anarchy,I thought this said William Fucking Dies
Sons of Anarchy,I think that author knew more about Sons of Anarchy than any other subject in that story
Sons of Anarchy,Haha he was the orion syndicate guy! That was a fun episode of Enterprise.
Sons of Anarchy,What a shame. This guy was such a delight to see on screen.
Sons of Anarchy,My favorite roles were in The Incredible Hulk.
Sons of Anarchy,"One, this makes me sad. I'm always hurt when a recurring DS9 character actor passes away. It's what I knew him best from. That and the amazing ""Jose Chung's 'From Outer Space'"" episode of the X-Files' third season. And two, he was EIGHTY?! Fucking hell, time flies. I guess because of the essentially random, atemporal nature of how you experience an actor's work, it's easy to subconsciously fall into this notion actors just kind of don't age at the same speed."
Sons of Anarchy,"He was the Rock's boss in The Rundown. 

Konlabos....with a K."
Sons of Anarchy,First [Kai Opaka](https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Opaka) and now [Furel](https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Furel)? This has been a rough week for DS9.
Sons of Anarchy,"Aww.. Piney. William Lucking was a fantastic actor with a surprisingly wide range. When he showed up, you knew you were gonna get a good one. RIP"
Sons of Anarchy,RIP! Prayers to his family and friends.
Sons of Anarchy,Amazing in SOA and will be missed
Sons of Anarchy,"Terrific addition to SoA. His on-screen death was tough to watch, that's how great of a character he was. RIP William."
Sons of Anarchy,I’m a digitally altered Major Kira voice…. “that’s one”
Sons of Anarchy,Rip big dog
Sons of Anarchy,No idea who this dude was but god damn he looked good at 80
Sons of Anarchy,Too bad it wasn’t Ron Perlman…….🤷🏻‍♂️
Sons of Anarchy,He looked young for his age. RIP.
Sons of Anarchy,"Yeah, I'm doing a rewatch of The West Wing and I saw him in an episode last week.  He was a union head negotiating with the president of a trucking company, and he got chastised by Leo for saying ""cut the crap.""  In light of all that's happened since it aired, it was quite a quaint scene."
Sons of Anarchy,"Ron Pearlman is the man. But Clay is a SOB in SOA

Opie was one of my favorites. Piney too"
Sons of Anarchy,Ye fuck clay
Sons of Anarchy,First 8
Sons of Anarchy,That’s a fucking quote to live and die by. RIP Piney.
Sons of Anarchy,Holy shit I didn’t realize that was him. Top 10 episode for sure
Sons of Anarchy,[I hope his soul can avoid the lava men](https://youtu.be/vdD_mnnfEBM?t=52).
Sons of Anarchy,Looked fucking great at 80
Sons of Anarchy,"Shocked also, definitely wouldn’t have put him at 80."
Sons of Anarchy,"What's crazy is how quickly my life has gone by since SOA premiered in 2008.  Thirteen years doesn't feel that long.  

What's scary is Lucking was 67 in 2008, which is the average age to retire.  Thinking about how that could be how quickly my life goes by after retiring is terrifying."
Sons of Anarchy,"Furel was only in a handful of episodes, but is somehow incredibly memorable. The whole speech he gives about why he never got his arm replaced is burned into my memory. All of Kyra's old cell where great, but he sold the, ""I've seen and done terrible things and I'm trying to cope with snarky humour and a crotchety demeanour"" the best."
Sons of Anarchy,I thought I was the only one
Sons of Anarchy,He was also a Bajoran Freedom Fighter in DS9.
Sons of Anarchy,She wasn’t supposed to leave that planet
Sons of Anarchy,"Your pah is strong, child"
Sons of Anarchy,He’s 68 in the photo used in the article.
Sons of Anarchy,"Whoa, is Ron a bad guy or something?"
Sons of Anarchy,"Col. Lynch in the A-Team. Man he was great.

I always wished towards the end he'd find out they were innocent and would team up with them or something. Cause even though he was their enemy he was still a good guy doing his job."
Sons of Anarchy,"I love that scene. “At midnight im drafting the truckers into the armed service. You’re gonna love our food!”


I love the west wing. So much so I tattooed it on my arm."
Sons of Anarchy,Watch Ryan Hurst Says Goodbye to Opie on Youtube if you haven't yet. Bring tissues.
Sons of Anarchy,"The club itself was more interested in killing its own members than worrying about other clubs and their business dealings. I guess the downfall was with Clay taking over and being a paranoid, ruthless prick."
Sons of Anarchy,For real when he tweeted he pissed all over his hands I realized we need someone that smart running for office
Sons of Anarchy,"""Old fat bastard here says ni\*\*er one more time and that walking out alive deal we talked about. . ? *Off* the fuckin' table.""

Racist piece 'o' shit."
Sons of Anarchy,Opie... That crushed me.
Sons of Anarchy,"Seriously, he aged well"
Sons of Anarchy,"I believe it was three episodes, and I can remember which ones so yeah, he was definitely memorable.

It was the one that introduced Shakaar, the one where he got whacked by Clay... er.... a Cardassian out for revenge, and a flashback to when Kira's father died."
Sons of Anarchy,"""Before I went into that... interrogation center... I asked the Prophets to give me the strength to get the rest of you out of there. And... that in exchange, I... I said I'd give up my life. Well, as it turned out, I was able to rescue you, Shakaar and Lupaza. It's only cost me an arm. I felt the... the Prophets were generous. Somehow, replacing the arm seems... ungrateful."""
Sons of Anarchy,Holy shit your right I can see it now :0
Sons of Anarchy,"Yeah. He kills puppies. Plus he tips like shit when he goes out to eat. To the gallows with him!!!! Haha!! No, I’m sure he’s a great guy. It was meant as satire. I just hated his character on SOA. Lol"
Sons of Anarchy,"Damn you were right. You can see the love 

You were also right about the tissue. I lost my best friend this year and this video just touched on it all. 

Whoever started the men don’t cry shit needs horse whipped. You can see the bond with Opie and Jax. That was real. 

On a side note. Shaved Opie did not look like
I expected."
Sons of Anarchy,Almost unrecognizable without the beard.
Sons of Anarchy,Well there were only like 4 characters in that show who weren’t complete pieces of shit.
Sons of Anarchy,"It's such a great moment because up until then, you are like, ""Why the fuck is this guy walking around with one arm? They have super-space-science, he could have five arms if he wanted"". Then he explains and you realize that it's symbolic of the loss and pain he faced during the occupation and a very real artifact of his PTSD and it just never seems out of place again."
Sons of Anarchy,I had an idea that was it but had to make sure :D
Sons of Anarchy,He was in remember the titans. Ryan Hurst looks 12 without the beard.
Sons of Anarchy,Like Jason Momoa in *Dune*
Once Upon a Time,"At first I thought OUAT was a terrible concept. Then I started watching and realized, oh, this is a great concept (and mostly great acting)! Then kept going and went, oh, they’re doing this very poorly."
Once Upon a Time,"Fuck that.

It's called FABLES. The show Once tried to be but gave up. 

And the game A Wolf Among Us

That's what I want"
Once Upon a Time,"Fuck that, Galavant season 3...let's fucking go!"
Once Upon a Time,"They tried something similar from the same people who made Once Upon A Time but didn't greenlight it after making the pilot. 

>Epic, the Disney-themed fairy tale anthology, is not moving forward at ABC.

>The Disney-owned broadcast network has opted to not pick up the drama pilot to series. Ordered to pilot in January under new network topper Craig Erwich, Epic would have marked a homecoming to ABC for Once Upon a Time creators Adam Horowitz and Edward Kitsis. The duo exec produced Epic alongside writer Brigitte Hales, who previously worked with Horowitz and Kitsis on Once Upon a Time and their short-lived Apple anthology Amazing Stories.

>Sources say the pilot didn’t come in strong despite execs being excited about the script. The pilot was filmed in Ireland, and, because of the pandemic, Kitsis and Horowitz were unable to go on location for the shoot.

Once Upon a Time,Once Upon a Time was awesome. It was so batshit insane that your cant even deacribe story arcs without sounds like you arent on large amounts of drugs
Once Upon a Time,[deleted]
Once Upon a Time,Disney+ should bring House of Mouse first
Once Upon a Time,I’d rather they do another galavant type Show
Once Upon a Time,Basically the comic Fable?
Once Upon a Time,"I think you're onto something. The actors who depicted those characters in OUaT are not the same people who depicted them in previous adaptations of those stories:

In the 'real world' of OUaT, the story of Cinderella existed which means that the movie where Julie Andrews played the character can exist. But the in their world there is no actress named Dania Ramirez, instead that body/face belongs exclusively to their real world Cinderella.

Now take the same logic and apply to a new Disney property like Star Wars. In our world, the story of SW exists. But if a SW version of OUaT was made, it would play out a scenario in which the 'real' SW characters traveled through a worm-hole the show's version of Earth. In that show, a new actor could depict Luke."
Once Upon a Time,"I like the idea of combining the OUAT concept with the Brothers Grimm movie concept that Matt Damon and Heath Ledger starred in. 

Don’t just like “make it dark,” but put a spin on it that makes it more interesting than just “what if fairytale characters existed in a small town.”"
Once Upon a Time,"They would never do it, but they should adapt the Fables comic. Shit would be amazing. Like Twin Peaks meets X Files meets Shrek. 

It’s Once Upon a Time. But… actually good (I’m sorry it was so hammy)"
Once Upon a Time,"I feel this way about Greek mythology. Can we get like a game of thrones, high quality show about the Greek gods?"
Once Upon a Time,"I love remakes of fairy tales and was prepared to adore Once, but it was awful. The first entire season was the main character literally not believing the basic premise of the show. And then it was just shoe-horning in a ton of properties to try and ""say the thing"" and get people to watch."
Once Upon a Time,or hbo should just make fables instead of this horrible disney abc garbage rip off
Once Upon a Time,Disney is too conservative to do fantasy right.
Once Upon a Time,"The concept of Disney properties having a crossover with each other?

That sounds a lot like Kingdom Hearts lol, but with a dash of anime

Oh yeah, what happened to that Kingdom Hearts Disney+ show that was announced a few years ago?"
Once Upon a Time,What you want is Live Action Kingdom Hearts which is basically Disney’s Game of Thrones.
Once Upon a Time,ABC-fied or woke garbage?
Once Upon a Time,"In the “lost pilots” thread that was posted here a few days ago, there was a similar concept set in monster lore (Frankenstein/Dracula/werewolf/etc)."
Once Upon a Time,Watch the 10th Kingdom. It's a miniseries so only a few episodes.
Once Upon a Time,[deleted]
Once Upon a Time,"As much as I'd love that, there's no way in hell Disney would adapt Fables literally. I mean, OUaT was a bit dark at times but Fables has GoT-level messed up stuff. And even though all characters have long been in the public domain I don't think any other network or platform would dare to try lest they anger the Mouse. I could see it in AppleTV+, though; CGI-heavy shows with grounded but twisted stories are right up their alley."
Once Upon a Time,"The fucked up thing is that ABC picked up Fables for an adaptation, then dropped it, and then almost immediately launched Once Upon A Time. Given the nature of the property, you can't really say they're violating the IP since it's all based off the public domain, but OUAT is very obviously a Fables rip-off"
Once Upon a Time,"YES YES YES YES YES.

And give it an actual ending, instead of the build up at the end of the comics leading to pretty much a thank you from the creators. Which was nice, but damn.

Hmmm, actually Fables deals with a lot of hardcore stuff. So send it to Hulu I guess."
Once Upon a Time,THIS PERSON FUCKING GETS IT
Once Upon a Time,Amen. Fables was an amazing journey.
Once Upon a Time,[deleted]
Once Upon a Time,Tad Cooper needs his day in the sun.
Once Upon a Time,What do y'all think of the writers absolute refusal to let Mr. Gold be redeemed? It was ultimately why I stopped watching after Mr. Gold fought so hard to be a good person and threw it all away yet again for like the 4th time. Sort of just felt repetitive.
Once Upon a Time,"I know! When I was watching all those years ago I would tweet just bits of info, my mind was being blown and I had to share it with the world lol.  Then I tweeted the spoiler about Red and finally my brother (one of my 3 followers lol) was like “I know this is about that show you watch, nothing you tweet makes sense, I guess I have to watch it now” He was hooked (😉) from day one!"
Once Upon a Time,"Yes.

But is difficult. If Disney wants to create a megahit they need Kingdom Hearts to be live action, and that would imply lots of money.

Also Kingdom Hearts' story is very difficult to understand because it became really complicated, especially since KH2, it would require a massive rework.

Then it's finding children and all the problems associated with it.

First, let's see how Percy Jackson and the Olympians performs..."
Once Upon a Time,"> but is the Kingdom Hearts series still in development?

Yes, KH4 got a trailer drop months ago but it doesn't look like it'll be involved with the Disney stuff, at least from the initial trailer."
Once Upon a Time,THE MOST AMBITIOUS CROSSOVER OF ALL TIME
Once Upon a Time,Man Zeus would make it awkward real quick. But it would/could be incredibly fun. Double fun cause my dogs name is Zeus and gets confused when he hears it on tv.
Once Upon a Time,For it to be a tax write off?
Once Upon a Time,Agreed. They carried that show.
Once Upon a Time,Fables is also owned by DC. So yeah Disney can't adapt it.
Once Upon a Time,"If I told you Disney would make a mini series of Pam and Tommy’s sex tape, and Chippendales rise and fall, would you say the same thing?"
Once Upon a Time,"I agree with everything you said.

I still won't budge. Too good not to make and if they can simply read a comic then it would be amazing. If someone can adapt fucking Sandman to tv then a true Fables is possible.

Fables or bust not another half ass like Once. I want the whole ass!"
Once Upon a Time,"> And even though all characters have long been in the public domain I don't think any other network or platform would dare to try lest they anger the Mouse.

If Mattel was willing to burn Disney with a rival to Disney Princesses despite being the company making Disney dolls I don't think any company fears Disney in regards to new expressions of public domain characters.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ever_After_High"
Once Upon a Time,"Yup, gave up.  

Instead of making something potentially revolutionary they went literal ABC and made a completely forgettable show.

It's not too late. Fables remains such a high quality that if you just do what Sandman did then you'd have a great show. Learn from the  Y Last Man and Runaways mistakes."
Once Upon a Time,Not sure if you know but Fables came back in 2022 with 12 more issues. Keeps going after 150
Once Upon a Time,Strong jaw and perfect hair!
Once Upon a Time,[deleted]
Once Upon a Time,Thanks. Now that’s running through my head as I’m working haha
Once Upon a Time,"Man Rumple went from one of the most interesting characters to one of the most annoying. They should’ve just let him stay dead after his sacrifice in season 3, that was a perfect end to his character."
Once Upon a Time,Im not buying that it needs to be live action to be a hit
Once Upon a Time,"> If Disney wants to create a megahit they need Kingdom Hearts to be live action

They literally designed Sora to look like a cartoon so that he could more easily hang out with all the other cartoons he was going to meet on his adventure through cartoon worlds, why would you want a live action version of that?"
Once Upon a Time,"
>Also Kingdom Hearts' story is very difficult to understand because it became really complicated, 

I will use any opportunity to post this video.

https://youtu.be/4YVTBQCbezQ

I can't even tell you how many times I've watched it over the years."
Once Upon a Time,"KH story would be easy to simplify, just delete 90% of it.  

Nothing of value was lost."
Once Upon a Time,They literally showed Endor in the trailer lol
Once Upon a Time,Hades shows up at the end of the trailer what are you talking about. Well not shows up but its him talking and throwing the fire to donald and goofy
Once Upon a Time,Disney can't adapt it *for free*
Once Upon a Time,ABC did work on a version of Fables in 2008
Once Upon a Time,"But those are not fairy tales, which are one of the main pillars of their brand. I really don't think they are very keen on turning formerly family-friendly characters into assassins, psychopaths, and brutal dictators. Or maybe they are, who knows, Peter Pan was pretty terrifying in OUaT."
Once Upon a Time,"Oh, I actually didn't. I remember a few years ago that they were planning a mini arc, but I didn't know it was released.

I'll look into that, cheers!"
Once Upon a Time,Cojones out to there
Once Upon a Time,A real ear worm.
Once Upon a Time,No it definitely does. It's not like Disney is famous for its animation or anything like that.
Once Upon a Time,doing it like Who Framed Roger Rabbit would be sick
Once Upon a Time,"I didn't say I wanted that.

I only said that if they want it to be a megahit the easiest way (and, at the same time most difficult way because of the problems it may face) is that. ;)"
Once Upon a Time,"DC, I’ve come to bargain"
Once Upon a Time,">	Peter Pan was pretty terrifying in OUaT.

 And in the disney+ rescue rangers movie"
Once Upon a Time,There was no hero quite like *GALAVAAAAANT!*
Once Upon a Time,"I guess if was more of a rhetorical “why would *anyone* want that?”  It’s supposed to be a cartoon, let it be a cartoon.  Kingdom Hearts 3 had multiple cutscenes so long my Xbox tries to turn itself off.  And there were worlds where it was like “long ass cutscene, fight three headless, long ass cutscene, fight two heartless, long ass cutscene, walk into another room, long ass cutscene.”  They clearly want to make a cartoon, just let them make a cartoon."
Once Upon a Time,"Sup Marvel, we got The Batman and uh..Peacemaker!"
Once Upon a Time,Tough! Plus every other man-ly value!
Once Upon a Time,"Because Sora looks like a human and is a human. This is the dumbest argument, why would you want a Live Action Avengers if they are drawn as comic characters? Makes no sense"
Once Upon a Time,"Mess with him, he'll disembowel you!"
Once Upon a Time,"YEAH! He ruled in every way!

A fairytale *cliche*."
Once Upon a Time,"I'm willing to bet that they would have Abuela making a deal with Rumple for the magic candle, and the magic is dying because of him."
Once Upon a Time,Isabella would own a flower shop like snow queen owned ice cream shop. Antonio would be the town's animal control. Camilo would be actor or town arts director. Julieta a doctor. Feel like all those could be added easily. Dolores a... Detective?... But why wouldn't we meet her before? Maybe there's a new page in Henry's book that prophesies some crazy shit (Bruno) and abuela comes in to calm everyone down while (I like your theory) she's bartering with rumps to get her candle back. Mirabel could be under evil queen's spell and freeing her is the trick to save the town
Once Upon a Time,Abuela turns out to somehow be Regina's long-lost grandmother.
Once Upon a Time,"At the end of one episode, we see the silhouette of a woman standing in a hallway while two characters have a super important conversation. Camera zooms out, it's the girl with the super hearing listening to the whole conversation! What? It ends up the whole family is in Storybrook to help out Rumpelstiltskin. But why? Because Mr.Science, aka Frankenstein is sick of getting beaten on by people with magic, so he recruits some magical people he met on his journeys across the world. Then he starts hooking up with another non-magical person who is surrounded by those with magic, since they can understand each other. An older Mirabella."
Once Upon a Time,It turns out the family in Encanto is related to the main character... and rumple.... and a few other characters.
Once Upon a Time,That show ended how many years ago. And was trash
Once Upon a Time,"Haha I haven't thought about Once Upon a Time in quite a while, but yeah it would be amazing to see them keep adding more and more disney stories.

Imagine if they had started the series now, and could put a proper disney+ budget behind it."
Once Upon a Time,"I have the feeling that it would be better for Netflix long-term if the original content they have has some form of conclusion. Without a conclusion, many people will decide not to even start a show, because they don't want to be left hanging at the end. Shows that got ""finished"" will be stuff that can still draw people to stay on Netflix. Completed shows is something that will stay forever as a viable offering and strengthen them as unique selling points for Netflix.  

I think that is something they need to consider going forward, but I doubt they will do this retroactively for shows that were already cancelled. 

But maybe I am wrong, maybe it will turn out that only very extreme good hit shows actually have any potential (like Friends or Office) to be seen 3+ years after release."
Once Upon a Time,Netflix wanted to have its own catalog of content to stream but its turning into an archive of unfinished series. I come and go as a subscriber but if this trend continues I'm going to be less likely to start new content with them.  I suppose their numbers are driving their decisions but I wonder what their numbers will look like in 5 years when people have more options and have observed a history of their favorite shows ending early.
Once Upon a Time,even though i'm not a biggest fan of this show (i definitely enjoyed season 2 though!) i really hope another outlet picks this show up and continues the story of the OA!
Once Upon a Time,"To be fair, Netflix was truly a beacon for unique programming. The criticism that they have changed their content model is fair, and subscribers can make their decisions on the platforms they chose. 

I dont agree that people have gone ballistic, rather in this circumstance a beloved series is in jeopardy of fading into the nebulous because of unnecessary broadcast/streaming rights. It paints viewers into a corner to fight for the show's renewal on its current platform."
Once Upon a Time,I get tired of finding shows that last 1-2 seasons and then get dropped. Get so old investing that much time.
Once Upon a Time,Season 2 really set the show up to be so much more. Super disappointed to hear it was canceled JUST as it was about to get better
Once Upon a Time,"I know it's been reiterated a hundred times in this sub, but Netflix's failure to issue a legitimate cancellation notice is uniquely odd here. Even after receiving a request from Forbes, Netflix referred to Cindy Holland's statement, which is....lacking finality?

But not joining the tinfoil-hatters. Nope. The OA is gone. For now. Maybe."
Once Upon a Time,"Nobody cared about Santa Clarita Diet, one of the more creative and consistently funny netflix shows."
Once Upon a Time,"I'd cancel Netflix if my wife didn't watch some shows on there.
The platform has been going down hill for a while now.

The OA was one of the most unique shows I've ever seen and I am not surprised at all that Netflix cancelled it. That seems to be their MO these days."
Once Upon a Time,"I like the show but let's be real, the time between season 1 and 2 was unheard of (Part 1 came out in December 2016 and part 2 came out in March 2019) in any format except for shows that have had revivals and it hadn't earned the audience or the money that Stranger Things had to justify another long production before they could push a new season.

While i do think there is a major issue with Netflix cancelling their original programming (which is going to be dangerous for them considering they're going to lose a large portion of their licensed library sooner rather than later) i don't think The OA is the hill to die on when there is justifiable reasons for cancellation."
Once Upon a Time,"Maybe semantics, but didn't Netflix already give the show and its creators ""a chance"" by buying and releasing it?"
Once Upon a Time,Wasn't a huge fan of The OA but it seemed good enough to justify finishing up the story. It was better than a lot of the cringy comedy specials (often by popular actors or whatever who are shitty standup acts).
Once Upon a Time,How is this show?
Once Upon a Time,"I think the main point here is that the creators and writers would have approached the entire series differently if they knew they were only getting 2 seasons. The plan was to tell this story over 5 seasons and there's no way that Netflix was unaware of that when they agreed to make the show.

A fair compromise would have been to tell them during the making of the second season that they would only have three seasons to tell their story. ""Seasons"" of tv shows are shorter than ever and people are gonna stop making ambitious shows if they think they're only gonna get 16-20 episodes."
Once Upon a Time,"Business acts like business, people go ballistic."
Once Upon a Time,The show hasn't really been canceled. We are all now part of the show.
Once Upon a Time,"netflix is trying so hard to the be the next generation bargain bin...

this is what happens when you run your company solely on statistics and forget about the art."
Once Upon a Time,"I'm not a religious person, but I will be praying for the safety of future Altered Carbon seasons..."
Once Upon a Time,Idk if I agree with that sentiment even though I wish OA wasn’t cancelled. Russian Doll for example is fucking whack and beautiful and fantastic and definitely is not in the wheelhouse of a normal cable company
Once Upon a Time,"Or maybe when it turns out people don't like a show that much, it doesn't make sense to continue making it.

Being willing to axe shows that don't work is a critical part of the shotgun method of giving a wide spectrum of ideas a chance. 

If they don't catch on, you have to stop making them, as continuing to produce hundreds of shows so long as anyone at all wants to see them is a surefire way to go out of business. 

They either make a lot of shows and cancel the ones that don't work, or they make fewer shows to begin with and give them a longer chance. Producing a lot of shows and giving them all a long chance doesn't make sense."
Once Upon a Time,"I've never seen The OA but I've felt this trend, not just for Netflix but among most of the streamers. Streaming used to be an upstart industry taking risks and building up the few original shows they had but now it's big business with many originals in the portfolio and they have to make bottom line decisions the way big businesses do. I still want that happy middle ground where they're big enough to put out cool stuff but not so the big they'll cancel it if it isn't an overnight hit. Like Tom Waits... he's been famous for decades but never a megastar. I want the Tom Waits of streaming services."
Once Upon a Time,You either die a hero or live long enough to become Viacom.
Greys Anatomy,Do they replace the embryo/fetus with a live grenade? Its all I expect from Greys Anatomy
Greys Anatomy,I’ve not seen the episode (stopped watching Greys years ago) but this has never been a topic they have hidden from. Christina had an abortion that was a central plot line years ago.
Greys Anatomy,I am almost 36 years old and watched the first season of this show with my mother my senior year in high school. How is it still on?
Greys Anatomy,This was a plot in the second season of Mad Men.
Greys Anatomy,"“Other's criticized the show's choice to represent an abortion at all: ""No matter your opinion, they shouldn't be showing an abortion on tv!""”

But torture porn like American Horror Story is absolutely fine! We can show murders, rapes, people getting slices taken off of them, but showing someone getting an abortion that’s a step too far!"
Greys Anatomy,"> “No matter your opinion, they shouldn’t be showing an abortion on tv!”

Translation: this isn’t my opinion and I don’t want to see it on tv!"
Greys Anatomy,Sex Education handled it really well
Greys Anatomy,"LADY - *I got pregnant but don't want a baby*   


DOCTOR - *Take these two pills and call me if you have any problems*   


(roll credits)"
Greys Anatomy,Why would they show an abortion and an early 90s tv show in the same episode?
Greys Anatomy,"For everyone saying “x did it first,” it hits a little different after Roe v. Wade getting overturned. It might not be grounding to show abortion (especially on a show that had a character wanting an abortion back in season 1), but it’s still very important and necessary to have this be on tv right now."
Greys Anatomy,So does Dirty Dancing.
Greys Anatomy,Shameless and ER did it first
Greys Anatomy,"republicans: ""believe it or not, straight to jail"""
Greys Anatomy,"Many comments on here aren’t acknowledging the step-by-step approach of the episode. Yeah yeah this subject may have played out in one of the early episodes when Christina had one, or whatever. This more in-depth variation can really help create better awareness around this topic. Someone may feel less fear about this MEDICAL PROCEDURE and maybe even help DISPEL MISINFORMATION AND INACCURACIES touted by groups who don’t believe women should have control their own bodies."
Greys Anatomy,South Park did it first
Greys Anatomy,"Anyone see the Degrassi episode where Manny had an abortion? It was banned in the US, luckily my friend had a bootlegged copy so I could watch it."
Greys Anatomy,"Well since we're apparently banning educators from teaching students about anything that Republicans don't like, this is basically the only workaround in red states (until DeSantis tries to arrest Shonda Rhimes or something)."
Greys Anatomy,"I don't watch the show but I love this. I was an abortion doula so witnessed a lot of abortions (up to 20 weeks, no late term) while providing women emotional support. Eventually I needed an abortion myself and felt soooooo much more comfortable because I already knew exactly what was happening/was going to happen to my body. It's such a simple procedure that should be normalized. Also, for all the abortions I witnessed (around 100), most women we're already mothers who couldn't handle or want another child. Only one woman changed her mind last minute which everyone in the clinic strongly supported. Some struggled through the procedure (emotions, physical discomfort) but NO ONE was regretful or worried they were making the wrong choice. I can't imagine not being allowed to make that choice over my body or telling someone else what to do with theirs."
Greys Anatomy,"Shocked about the number of people that are completely butthurt over a tv show depicting an abortion as such. If you don’t want to watch it, just turn it off. Boom, problem solved."
Greys Anatomy,Hasn't the show been slowly aborting itself for some time now?
Greys Anatomy,Six Feet Under showed a medical abortion back in early 2000s.  Most realistic portrayal I saw of it too.
Greys Anatomy,"After almost 19 consecutive years watching this show, I think Shonda Rimes is a genius. I grew up watching Ellen Pompeo grow up in that show, so it strikes a chord for me. I guess that’s why I can overlook the bus fires in the pouring rain and bombs in a cadaver’s belly."
Greys Anatomy,How edgy
Greys Anatomy,"Greys is like calamity city. I dont get it. Here's a cancer surgery during an earthquake while being held hostage and surgery needs to be done while a bomb is planted at the hospital that's currently also dealing with a plague outbreak. 

Oh and it's super awkward because the patient also sleep with 2 of the surgeons... and 1 of their moms..."
Greys Anatomy,The post is so amazing to me; I had no idea that Grey’s Anatomy was still going; keep it up.  Heigl probably misses that reliable paycheck
Greys Anatomy,"I have mixed feelings about abortion - while I find it reprehensible that a woman would do it just because it inconveniences her, I think it’s completely necessary for it to be 100% pro-choice.  I think that full education on what exactly goes on in an abortion helps people make an ethical decision based on their situation.  So I’m okay with more information being out there"
Greys Anatomy,Good
Greys Anatomy,👏👏👏
Greys Anatomy,"My partner is watching this show now and all I keep thinking whenever it’s on is how it seems like a less convenient version of Scrubs.

Ageing boss doctor who everyone hates - check

Extremely competitive and superstitious black surgeon with a lucky doo-rag - check

Pretty blonde doctor who struggles with sexism from her fellow doctors- check 

Maverick veteran doctor who could progress in his career if he just dealt with his ego and played the game a little - check

Troublemaking ex-wife of the maverick doctor who really wants him back - check

Main male character with that same bloody hairdo - check

Main character with a parent who dies a few seasons in - check

Pervy idiot surgeon who seems like he might be the product of inbreeding - check

That same wee old lady who dies in the first season of both shows so the main character can learn how to cope with death - check

Somewhat endearing brown-haired dude who dies tragically in a twist ending a few seasons in - check

I could go on forever like this. It’s scrubs but the episodes are twice as long and with less comedy and there’s no real ending to the show."
Greys Anatomy,"This will actually change minds and affect people. My mom was staunchly anti-blm and we’re all humans and we all matter. I’m a history teacher and she told me to teach about the history of white slavery with indentured servants 🙄. However, after the episode where they talked about George Floyd she started to change her mind. It opened her eyes to the reality black people face. I’m glad they tackled this tough subject

Edit: she was anti-blm not pro"
Greys Anatomy,"Yeah, in seasons 15-19"
Greys Anatomy,Are we referring to an episode or the show?
Greys Anatomy,I thought this was The Onion
Greys Anatomy,This show is still on?
Greys Anatomy,👍
Greys Anatomy,I like this.
Greys Anatomy,Right on. Good for them
Greys Anatomy,"There was a cardiovascular surgeon, neurosurgeon, general surgeon, OB/GYN, and an ER doc all in on the procedure."
Greys Anatomy,"Just seen it. It was a single but, maybe a minute. I think my wife and I talked over the top of it.

Grey's has shown a lot of stuff related to abortion and the bans in various states recently. Will the same people getting into a fuss over this also complain that they recently showed a patient being transported in a state where abortion was banned die at the side of the road due to lack of care?"
Greys Anatomy,"Gilbert Gottfried plays the foetus in an emmy worthy disgruntled performance.

Greys Anatomy,I can hear some people in the background saying a word that rhymes with “Bloke”
Greys Anatomy,Ridiculous.
Greys Anatomy,Couldn't have been a late term abortion. They wouldn't have showed that.
Greys Anatomy,"Hope they include terms like ""Safe Time Frame"". Late abortion is quite dangerous.

Disclaimer: I am from a country where abortions are not allowed to rape victims, forcing underaged girls to have child, and not supporting after birth. While illegal abortions like pushing red hot iron rods to womb to force abortion is quite common. 

If a single woman wants to have abortions, it's up to them. For family, planned parenthood and marriage counseling should be more prioritized, as married woman pregnancy is not only her concern. That's my take."
Greys Anatomy,They did an enigma on the patient? What
Greys Anatomy,"Dr take an oath to do no harm.     Showing an Abortion went to far.

I will not be watching. Grey's anatomy anymore."
Greys Anatomy,This is great but also.. not great. Ever since I learnt about how some women use the cloth hanger to do it I want to know less about abortion really.
Greys Anatomy,Step by Step also show's a copy of Grey's Anatomy.
Greys Anatomy,Love the username
Greys Anatomy,Greys anatomy STILL has new episodes?
Greys Anatomy,I thought the title was a clever dig on the quality and questionable longevity of Grey’s Anatomy.
Greys Anatomy,TIL Grey's Anatomy is still running.
Greys Anatomy,"Man these headlines are really critical. Anyhow, what’s the episode about?"
Greys Anatomy,"Grey's Anatomy Shows an Abortion: 'Step by Step'

""Hey Meredith, remember this Brady Bunch rip off from the 90s?""

""Come on, it wasn't that bad. Al was soooooo prettty"
Greys Anatomy,"Plot twist, it was a trans woman."
Greys Anatomy,Didn’t April do this already?
Greys Anatomy,Nobody cares! It's not our body to dictate her medical decisions.
Greys Anatomy,The abortion was done in a crashing plane while they were hiding from an active shooter.
Greys Anatomy,"I watched one episode of this show, where the person they're operating on has a bomb inside them. That was enough for me."
Greys Anatomy,"Good thing it’s not House, he’d probably perform the abortion to try and cure suspected Lupus and then realise five minutes before the end of the episode that it was food poisoning or something"
Greys Anatomy,I watched this show with my wife for a couple of seasons and I was convinced that I would move away from their universe's version of Seattle from all the events that happen there.
Greys Anatomy,That hospital has to have more confirmed kills than the US Army.
Greys Anatomy,Pink mist: it was a girl?
Greys Anatomy,Only if they have 100 pick pocket
Greys Anatomy,Asking the real questions
Greys Anatomy,lol the only episode I ever saw was right after a superbowl...  there was randomly a bomb in the hospital
Greys Anatomy,Is she going to blow up?
Greys Anatomy,"She almost had two. I love greys anatomy Season 1-10 with all my heart (minus a certain crash) and it’s due to Sandra Oh. She low key carries the show for so long and it honestly annoyed me that she just became an accessory to men. 

The fact that they repeated her being pregnant storyline was when I knew she was gone, and the show ran out of shit to say. Cristina Yang was a control freak character who vehemently didn’t want kids, she wouldn’t be that careless about birth control twice. Also, Fuck Owen. Grrr"
Greys Anatomy,They deadass did this in the bottom half of this very season and made an entire episode of discussing the overturning of the law thingy
Greys Anatomy,Ok so I havent watched all of it but are you talking about her tubal pregnancy?
Greys Anatomy,Richard was supposed to be retiring in season 3 and he’s somehow still on the show
Greys Anatomy,There's something about successful doctor shows that make them last longer... ER was on for 15 seasons itself. And if they had these kinds of TV execs we got now it would have been on for five more even though it was really dragging the last three seasons or so.
Greys Anatomy,Because it’s just a soap opera but in prime time. Some things never change
Greys Anatomy,Even Ellen Pompeo wants it to end lol
Greys Anatomy,I'm surprised a scripted show lasted this long. Usually it's the reality competition shows that never end. Every time I see a preview for The Bachelor I can't believe it is still on. I haven't watched it since I was in high school and I graduated 20 years ago.
Greys Anatomy,"Every single time this show gets mentioned here there will be, without fail, people asking ""hOw Is ThIs StIlL oN???""

Well, the answer that you and seemingly tons of other people seek is quite simple: because people still watch it."
Greys Anatomy,My wife still watches it.   I just asked her why and she said she just likes watching it and the characters.    Like  others have said it almost a soap opera at this point.    She loves these hour long dramas.
Greys Anatomy,It's the evening soap that doesn't stop.
Greys Anatomy,My friend still watches it. I wanted her to show me some clips from the latest episodes. It looks completely like a different show and doesn't even have the same classic vibes anymore.
Greys Anatomy,Because it’s still getting good ratings? SVU has been on five years longer.
Greys Anatomy,"Same here. And the MC always looked old to me. Couldn't really focus on the history cause I was always thing ""isn't she too old to be a resident?""."
Greys Anatomy,"Well, I’ve never seen it lol. How’s the writing"
Arrested Development,"I love all my streaming services equally

Earlier that day: I don’t care for Netflix"
Arrested Development,"Arrested Development season 4 was the reason I signed up for Netflix in the first place! 

I'm also not a person who generally rewatches shows but Seasons 1-3 are my comfort shows.  I will probably just buy the seasons on physical media (if I can find it.)"
Arrested Development,[deleted]
Arrested Development,"What were they just too CHICKEN to pay for it???

CA-CA-CAWW CA-CA-CAWW"
Arrested Development,Why?! How much could it cost to keep it on? $10?!
Arrested Development,"And once again the need for physical media is made necessary. Thankfully the first four seasons have dvd releases but the fifth never got one. Is it good? No, but it's extra official AD media that - if it wasn't going to Hulu/Disney due to expired rights - would eventually just disappear. Streaming exclusives *are a plague* and is going to be responsible for the mass disappearance of shows and movies in the near future because execs want to keep their subs in the here and now."
Arrested Development,Sad snoopy music
Arrested Development,"Michael: Get rid of the Seaward.
Lucille: I’ll leave when I’m good and ready.

Still cracks me up."
Arrested Development,"How do you lose the rights to air a show you produced a season of? 

Netflix is becoming a textbook example of squandering a lead."
Arrested Development,Ive had season 1-3 on DVD for roughly twenty years and always glad I do.
Arrested Development,"It’s the rights to a tv show, Michael. What could it cost? $10?"
Arrested Development,God that's dumb. I wonder if where season 4 lands it will keep the original cut (the superior imo) or the 22 episode redux that doesn't work at all so they basically make the narrator the main character.
Arrested Development,but I thought there was always money in the Banana  stand
Arrested Development,I wish Disney+ in America would incorporate way more of the content it relegates to Hulu. Like how they do it internationally. Seems like that service could be so much better if they embraced that content like they have elsewhere. I mean Arrested Development totally feels like it would fit on the same services that hosts The Simpsons.
Arrested Development,Guess I’ll finally watch it. Don’t hate when I have motivators like this since I never know what to choose to watch and sometimes like the decision being made with the sheer amount of content everywhere nowadays.
Arrested Development,"Arrested season four was one of the founding pillars of Netflix original content. I remember being 12 and thinking “pfft, Netflix ordinals? We’ll see how long that lasts.”"
Arrested Development,"This is my fault guys...

I started 30 rock. It went bye bye.

I decided to re-watch arrested development.

Oops. :-/

Quick, name some shows you hate, and I'll start them next!"
Arrested Development,This is why physical media should never die. I'm sick of people telling me that Blu-rays/dvds are pointless.
Arrested Development,"They got rid of The Office and now Arrested Development and they’re raising prices and also being draconian about shared passwords? Bye, Netflix."
Arrested Development,Funny because I’m leaving Netflix in February
Arrested Development,"Lots of things leaving Netflix in March

Mostly Canadian subscribers"
Arrested Development,"I’m just watching this and love it but after reading the comments, what the hell happened to season 4? Original cut? Redux? Why isn’t it just episodes I watch??"
Arrested Development,"Wait, but Netflix owns 2 seasons.. are they selling it to someone else?"
Arrested Development,My reasons to keep Netflix are dwindling.
Arrested Development, Guess who has two thumbs and is also leaving Netflix in march?
Arrested Development,Good thing I have the first three seasons on DVD.
Arrested Development,Aren’t seasons 4 & 5 Netflix originals? That’s so odd
Arrested Development,"If Netflix ever loses its rights to Bojack Horseman (is owned by Tornante Company), I'll cancel the service."
Arrested Development,"Not that there’s necessarily a big demand for this, but will there be any legal way to watch seasons 4 and 5 after the show leaves Netflix?"
Arrested Development,Netflix: I’ve made a huge mistake
Arrested Development,"The ol' ""charge more for less"" business philosophy that always goes great for embattled companies."
Arrested Development,"God it's annoying how shows keep moving around, went to watch it's always sunny to find ts gone from my service and it went to a service I do not have.."
Arrested Development,Lmao Netflix can’t fail fast enough
Arrested Development,Reminds myself I need to finish season 5. I never went back to it when they split the season in two releases. Can't even remember what happens in the front half.
Arrested Development,I always thought it was weird how I could watch Arrested Development on both Disney+ and Netflix here in India.
Arrested Development,As if we needed another reason to quit Netflix.
Arrested Development,"Time to rewatch the show then, 'cause I'm not watching them on hulu with ads."
Arrested Development,"I never did get around to watching season 5, but I do love the first 3 seasons. Like everyone else."
Arrested Development,"I have never seen it or Parks n rec or the office, none of those are available in my region.... #someday #goals"
Arrested Development,"Canadian here, remind me why I should keep this shit when they’re cracking down on passwords and in exchange we get this"
Arrested Development,"They should just pet the royalties, what could it cost? $10?"
Arrested Development,I don’t think I could have taken netflix from the top to the bottom with the same graceful incompetence if someone was paying me to do just that
Arrested Development,I wasn't a fan of the season were they split up the cast.  I'm sure there was a reason behind it.  The first seasons rocked.
Arrested Development,SAY GOODBYE TO THESE!
Arrested Development,"Most canadian are leaving netflix next week to, soo who cares!"
Arrested Development,Netflix is taking away my security blanket so now I can finally cancel my service
Arrested Development,TIL there is a season 5 of Arrested Development.
Arrested Development,I got a ton of down votes for saying that it wouldn't surprise me if Disney eventually took this show away a few years ago
Arrested Development,"The article mentions that it should come to Disney Plus in the UK. I really hope that is the case, I love watching this show. Well, the first three seasons."
Arrested Development,"That's ridiculous. Honestly, why make it a Netflix exclusive and then just toss it overboard?"
Arrested Development,I think all subscribers are leaving Netflix in March.
Arrested Development,So are a lot of their subscribers
Arrested Development,good. have you seen what BS they’re pulling in Canada?  I’m cancelling right at the end of this billing cycle. fuck netflix.
Arrested Development,It’s on Hulu
Arrested Development,I need to watch it now
Arrested Development,Nooooooo.  It's like a go to for me.
Arrested Development,"Since this is 20th Century Fox produced, it will probably end up on Hulu."
Arrested Development,FUCK YOU NETFLIX.
Arrested Development,Canadian family account subscriber here. That's not the only thing that's going to be leaving Netflix in March.
Arrested Development,"They’re going to make a show called “The Banana Stand” 

Because there’s ALWAYS money in “The Banana Stand” *Click *Click"
Arrested Development,God 1-3 is peak comedy
Arrested Development,"It’s one streaming service Michael, what could it cost? 10 dollars?"
Arrested Development,“A Netflix original series”
Arrested Development,I truly don’t understand how/why **Netflix produced shows** are removing their own content.
Arrested Development,It was never on Netflix where I am
Arrested Development,"What, like the guy spending $15 a month is going to keep paying when this show leaves, come on!

You would have assumed they could hold onto it with the reboot…"
Arrested Development,Man. Netflix sucks.
Arrested Development,"This is where I draw the line, Netflix. There's dozens of us! Dozens!"
Arrested Development,Will seasons 4 and 5 Release on dvd??? Omg I never got to watch this show I need to start binging asap
Arrested Development,"what the fuck. Thinking it is definitely time for puts on Netflix, so many bad decisions are happening"
Arrested Development,Literally the thing we're watching on Netflix right now. This combined with their password sharing on my 4 screens plan locking out my parents (or usage at my cabin) and I'm done. Bye Netflix.
Arrested Development,"I figured this would happen eventually. In a similar instance The Mindy Project, also originally a fellow Fox series, was recently put on Netflix despite being Hulu-exclusive after season 2."
Arrested Development,"That's odd.  Figured they would have got full rights to the last two seasons at least, or even perpetual streaming rights to the first ones as a condition for making the last two."
Arrested Development,Even the bad seasons?
Arrested Development,Like many of their customers.
Arrested Development,So are most of their paying subscribers...
Arrested Development,I think we as a human race is okay with this... But I'll be damned that family guy/American dad/and the office left I was pissed as shit
Arrested Development,I left Netflix in February
Arrested Development,joining half of the userbase.
Arrested Development,I dumped Netflix not playing their pricing game or revolving show game.
Arrested Development,So are a lot of users…
Arrested Development,"Same, but maybe sooner…"
Arrested Development,oh what the fuck...
Arrested Development,And many subscribers are leaving Now!
Arrested Development,What a coincidence I’m also leaving Netflix :)
Arrested Development,"And all the customers are leaving in Feb (sharing BS).

Netflix is going to be blockbuster by end of year if they dont reverse course."
Arrested Development,How did I *not* realize Ron Howard narrated?? That makes him seem 300% more hip.
Arrested Development,"Ironic, I just left Netflix in February."
Arrested Development,Oh no..... anyway.
Arrested Development,Guess I officially have no reason to have a Netflix account now
Arrested Development,It’s almost like Netflix wants us all to go sailing the high seas again. Ive stopped fighting it. And my Synology is processing the new disk I added this morning.
Arrested Development,All 3 Seasons??
Arrested Development,"Would ya look at that, so am I."
Arrested Development,"Sick, one more great reason to push Mom to finally dump her subscription. Most of the incompetent nonsense lately hasn’t phased her but between the sharing crackdown and now this, I think they’ve finally chewed at their ankles enough for her to cut it."
Arrested Development,I can’t bring myself to watch it anymore after hearing how the male stars treated Jessica Walter.
Arrested Development,[deleted]
Arrested Development,Even more reason to cancel.
Arrested Development,This is where my dvds come in!
Arrested Development,Hopefully the last 2 seasons are “tragically lost” in the transition.
Arrested Development,"The Gob episode of season 4 was as funny as anything else Arrested Development did during the first three seasons. But besides that, meh."
American Horror Story,It is a huge sprawling mess across the board. I have the distinct impression that the first few episodes of each season are well thought out and planned and generally pretty good and then the writers just start making shit up as they go. I wonder if they have a huge dartboard with random shit written on it.
American Horror Story,1 and 2 are the good seasons. It just gets worse.
American Horror Story,"Unfortunately, if you don't like the first couple of Seasons, you're not going to like the later episodes.  It gets really bad after Freak Show."
American Horror Story,"No. It’s always the same problem:

1.	strong, intriguing start
2.	then show runner gets distracted by something shiny about halfway through the season
3.	then it goes off the rails
4.	awful ending

The only coherent season was the one about the girls school for witches."
American Horror Story,"The writers don't understand story structure, and they never figure it out."
American Horror Story,"It's hilarious that you feel this way because most longtime AHS fans feel like the show went downhill after season two with only some redeeming seasons/moments.

Although maybe if you hate the first two seasons you'll enjoy the seasons that the majority of other fans hate."
American Horror Story,"American Horror Story is pretty much always a mess. Each season tends to start strong but loses direction after about 4 episodes and unravels into an incoherent, flabby disaster. S2 is probably the best season so if you didn't like it then it's probably not for you. I still enjoy it but my expectations for it are pretty low."
American Horror Story,If you think those are bad… just wait until you get to Apocalypse
American Horror Story,"The first season is by far the strongest and most cohesive. Second season is a mess but fun. Third season is a campy mess but fun. After that it only gets more laborious and convoluted and self indulgent. Season 4 is actually infamous for a lot of people not finishing it. I don’t recommend going past season 3, especially if you’re already finding it to be this way."
American Horror Story,No it gets way worse
American Horror Story,"Oh god no, lol. I mean, some later seasons are entertaining, but every one of them is a damn mess."
American Horror Story,"My absolute favorite was season 3, American Horror Story: Coven.  That season had excellent story lines, phenomenal acting from the cast and it wasn’t predictable.  I tried to hang in there with each new season but it just kept getting more ridiculous.  I saw the previews for the latest season AHS: NYC.  The previews always make the show look so juicy and interesting but when you watch each episode, it just turns out to be really campy."
American Horror Story,Lol no. Actually the first 2 especially asylum are the best.
American Horror Story,No
American Horror Story,"If you didn’t like those, you would have a terrible time going forward."
American Horror Story,Hahaha. Nope
American Horror Story,It doesn't get better. Chekhov's gun is always being violated
American Horror Story,Season 1 is the only one I really liked
American Horror Story,"No. It’s always like this, just in different flavors."
American Horror Story,"Those are the two best seasons. If you don't like those two seasons, then you just don't like the show. There are some okay seasons following those, but they range from mediocre to what-the-fuck-were-they-thinking level of awful."
American Horror Story,Yeah if you don't like S1 and 2 you may like 3 but otherwise give up.
American Horror Story,"It’s a fucking shitshow honestly, but some seasons are a ton of fun. I adore coven and 1984 since they’re just so goofy and cheesy"
American Horror Story,AHS: Coven (Season 3) is the best season of the series. IMO.
American Horror Story,"Every part of this show is a huge sprawling disasters mess. I honestly don't know how people can enjoy it.

I legitimately think they just make it up as they go. The season starts off with an interesting idea, then diverts into 50 different directions and loose ends that go nowhere and plot holes everywhere and nothing makes sense. Rinse and repeat."
American Horror Story,The first one was great. It progressively gets worse.
American Horror Story,"That's how Ryan Murphy runs all his shoes, halfway through her just introduces new characters and plot points when he has wrapped up what has already started and no clear direction for where it's going"
American Horror Story,Kinda seems like its the MO of the show. I will say NYC had a clear metaphor
American Horror Story,Hell to the no it doesn’t get better
American Horror Story,"Coven, Freak Show, Hotel and maybe Apocalyse are the only descent ones."
American Horror Story,It certainly doesn’t get ***better*** lol
American Horror Story,Congrats you got through the watchable seasons. Might as well stop now.
American Horror Story,"It honestly was never good to me, but I normally hear people say they at least like the first two seasons."
American Horror Story,I’d watch season 3 and season 8.
American Horror Story,"Not sure it gets crazier than the  one about the mental hospital, oh my lord."
American Horror Story,No
American Horror Story,I loved it until I got sober.  I don't think it's intended to be consumed that way.
American Horror Story,"Nope it just gets worse. And this is coming from someone that stuck with it for ten seasons. 

American Horror Story is such a great concept. It’s a shame it wasn’t in the hands of a more competent director. I wish Mike Flanagan had created AHS."
American Horror Story,"No they get worse!  The stories start out interesting but soon get bogged down in their own mythology.  Like the 1984 season, which I thought was going to be a straight slasher story got out of control at the midway point and never fully recovered.  Plus the same cast each season is getting tiresome.  Sarah Paulson gets on my nerves.  And the overtly gay themes really hinder the series.  Plus the glamorization of real life serial killers is unsettling…"
American Horror Story,"Are you watching these in weekly installments or binging each season? I ask because the series, to me, does not lend itself to binging. You need time between each episode to breathe… and forgot things. Overall, the entire series is batshit with some seasons having better arcs and episodes than others. Watch American Horror Stories if you’re looking for something in the same vein but in much smaller doses of absurdity."
American Horror Story,Hahaha I kept yelling at my TV. Lock the doors and stop these weirdos from going into your house! But I did enjoy s1 and first half of s2
American Horror Story,No. They’re all awful shows that suffer from poor writing and a constant need to shock the audience with cheap tricks. Embarrassing stuff.
American Horror Story,"I had such high hopes for it. The first few episodes of the first season were genuinely creepy. And then it all fell apart. I made it through season 1 & 2, tried 3 and gave up, and occasionally try again and give up every time."
American Horror Story,"No

it’s just gore for the sake of shock value. Especially in the later seasons."
American Horror Story,If you don't like the first two seasons then quit while you're ahead. It only gets worse.
American Horror Story, not at all
American Horror Story,"Unfortunately not.  The format seems to always start with a premise that's compelling/has promise, does some interesting things here and there, then it goes a bit off-track when it starts to just try to tick boxes for horror in that genre, ends up forgetting/abandoning some of the interesting stuff from the beginning, and then the writers panic trying to wrap-up up as many plotlines as they can in the last few episodes.

The only season that I thought that faired a little better was *Roanoke*.  Though only because it followed the reality TV interview and re-enactment format and then there's a reveal about the veracity of the interviewee statements when all hell breaks loose.  It also featured Kathy Bates, Leslie Jordan, and Stefanie Germanotta.  It's still a heck of a mess though."
American Horror Story,"As an AHS fan no, it gets worse."
American Horror Story,Circus and hotel are legit
American Horror Story,"No. It get more weird in a not scary way. Ryan Murphy grows his ego as time goes on, leaning hard in to identity politics, alternative lifestyles and political positions he disagrees with to create ""horror"". It just comes out outlandish."
American Horror Story,Freakshow was the only good season imo. It actually felt like something resembling horror.
American Horror Story,"I think the total messiness is kind of the charm of the show. It goes so far off the rails in every season and you're just along for the ride and the ""omg"" moments. It's really bad at many points but it's one of a kind at least."
American Horror Story,"Season 3 is pretty amazing. Watch that season at least before bouncing.

I agree though that Season 2 is all over the place without much payoff to the subplots tying into anything."
American Horror Story,"No, it just gets progressively worse."
American Horror Story,lol it gets progressively worse the longer it goes
American Horror Story,"Season 2 was the worst mess in my opinion. They couldn't decide on a villain, so they just put all of them in and called it a day."
American Horror Story,"The entire show, all of the seasons, I would compare to a fresh dog turd! Basically a shitshow to watch and only satisfying for whoever made it! Avoid like the plague!"
American Horror Story,It gets worse and worse progressively.
American Horror Story,"The best seasons by far are season 2 and 11, Asylum and NYC. Everything else is a huge step down."
American Horror Story,"Season 1 is ok, it is descent, it keeps up with a central idea. (for a first season it is pretty good by normal standards )

Season 2 asylum  they improve abit, but it gets confusing with all the aliens stuff. still it is ok 

Then \]coven, freak show and hotel They are pretty good. Hotel to be frank the only thing saving it is lady gaga and mat bomer. but coven and freak show are very good 

Went down hill with Roanoke and cult those are trash 

Apocalypse is a continuation of coven and it ties some of the past seasons together so I like how they did that. 

Then 1984, double feature, and NYC are all trash really."
American Horror Story,"I watched the show completely out of order. I pulled a list of the ones I've seen:

  
Murder House	12	October 5, 2011	December 21, 2011  
Asylum	13	October 17, 2012	January 23, 2013  
Coven	13	October 9, 2013	January 29, 2014  
Freak Show	13	October 8, 2014	January 21, 2015  
Apocalypse	10	September 12, 2018	November 14, 2018  
1984	9	September 18, 2019	November 13, 2019  


I think those are the ones I watched. I'd have to say I really enjoyed 1984 it was a lot of fun but Coven was excellent, I loved the witches. Freaks was the first season I watched and I enjoyed that as well. I love the special guest in Coven and then the start of the one episode just fit so perfectly. But quickly looking at that list, yeah Murder house is my least favorite. Asylum was decent."
American Horror Story,YES
American Horror Story,"They usually start out pretty good, but almost always fail to stick the landing by the end. Some of my favorite stories are the one-off episode flashback stories, because that’s what they’re best at telling: short, contained narratives. 
With AHS, I found it was best to only watch the seasons that intrigued me from the outset and avoid the others. Murder House, Coven, and Apocalypse are my favorite ones."
American Horror Story,"No, this show was only good for a season. Considerably downhill after that. Weird thing is that all of the seasons turn about 8 episodes in and gets very very odd. Ending almost always sucks to each season. I would, however, recommend Ratchet on Netflix. That was a good series by Ryan Murphy that didn’t get too twisted or weird by the end."
American Horror Story,It’s just hit or miss. Asylum and Hotel are among my favorites but even the first season I didn’t really like. Never finished the most recent season.
American Horror Story,Those were the best two seasons to me. I’ve pretty much stopped completely after Apocalypse.
American Horror Story,No
American Horror Story,It starts turning into shock horror and it's just not for me. I'm sure the kids like it.
American Horror Story,AHS’s entire writing premise is throw a million zany ideas at the wall and see what sticks. If anything it gets even more incoherent as it goes.
American Horror Story,The one in P Town was actually the best and it was last year.
American Horror Story,I found it all to be too torture-porny and couldn’t watch it. My wife loved it though
American Horror Story,No
American Horror Story,"No, it's all like that."
American Horror Story,"I had completely given up on the show during the Hotel season, so my opinion is based off only those earlier seasons - 

Felt that S1 (House) and S3 (Coven) were the best of what I watched, with some of  S2's 'random shit thrown at you' episodes being the worst."
American Horror Story,No
American Horror Story,"Style over substance. It goes downhill, more than you can fathom. 

Ryan Murphy is a mystery to me. As bad as American Horror Story was, American Crime Story (at least seasons 1 and 2) are exceptional."
American Horror Story,"Trust me….it gets worse, much worse"
American Horror Story,It actually gets worse and worse lol
American Horror Story,"It gets worse. There are blips, where I liked a particular character or episode, but none of the seasons are very cohesive or coherent."
American Horror Story,Season 2 is peak AHS cut your losses and quit now.
American Horror Story,It gets exponentially worse actually.
American Horror Story,No. Watched a lot of them with my wife. It gets worse.
American Horror Story,"The Ryan Murphy effect: Show starts with immense potential and intrigue.

*flash forward to 7 unfulfilled plots and awful pandering dialogue*

Or maybe I should say flashBACK since they took an entire season of Apocalypse and turned it into Coven 2.0"
American Horror Story,"Freak Show, season 4 was my favorite. Followed by 2, then 1. It falls off after 4. But please watch Freak Show. It’s great."
American Horror Story,"No 8cbaul no 9t really,it sort of stops being. It sort of start stops being about a story and instead beyond visually focuses on the most a couple who haven't seen it focuses on the married couple who typically is the most annoying married couple history of planet I bailed on this newest season after like three episodes I was like unless they all die like in the first five seconds for the next episode I don't care what's going to happen ask my adult daughter the other day if she was watching the American horror story New York which is the newest one and she said dad that thing's so horrible no I stopped after she is I don't know if I made all the way through the first episode that it's just it's bad it's the worst thing I've ever seen and she loves the horrible she loves cheesy movies it's just bad not they sold the franchise to somebody else that's some other writers what's going on but it just didn't have to be good in a long time"
American Horror Story,"If you didn't like season 2 it's probably not for you, that's generally as a high point for the show.

I love it all but sort of accept a certain level of camp. It's always a little bit of a mess."
American Horror Story,No
American Horror Story,"Coven is probably the best season by far! Asylum was pretty good. Apocalypse is like the sequel to Coven. Hotel was ok. NYC was good too!

Didn't watch Double Feature, 1984, or Roanoke"
American Horror Story,I lost interest after Freak Show. I just couldn’t get into the singing.
American Horror Story,"I could only make it through the entirety of the first season. After that I would try to watch a whole season,but the plots become more and more bizarre as each season goes into the back half. I guess I was able to follow the entirety of the vampire half season too. Maybe they should do that more often. They set up interesting premises and intriguing characters, but fail to keep attention after a few episodes. I think this is a fairly prevalent opinion of AHS"
American Horror Story,I think I’m the only person on the planet who hated season 2 of this show haha season 1 is still my favorite.
American Horror Story,Ironically the first 2 seasons are considered the good ones. They get way worse the more you watch
American Horror Story,No
American Horror Story,I get to the point of AHS season where I’m tired of Sarah Paulson’s character (usually because of the screams) and root for her to die. Cult season especially 😂
American Horror Story,No.
American Horror Story,The show just sucks so bad. From the start.
American Horror Story,No.
American Horror Story,"With few exceptions, there's generally two types of horror stories.  Some have great buildup, and keep the tension so high, the payoff can't possibly keep up.  The others tend to struggle building tension, but put all the pieces together into a great climax.  

AHS is always the first type, with the added problem of you can't tease a mystery forever.  By the end of the seasons, we know enough about what's happening that it loses some of it's tension, and there's always so many competing plotlines that the endings get cluttered.

It's a good show, but it's always a mess."
American Horror Story,"No, it doesn't. Season 1 and 2 were the best seasons of that show."
American Horror Story,"I enjoy all of it honestly. There are amazing seasons, and not so good ones. I love the cast through and through"
American Horror Story,"I couldn’t get through 2, but I came back to it and watched a season here and there.  I really liked Coven and I agree with a lot of others that it was silly."
24,Started watching Mad Men for the first time this week. Definitely a lot of smoking
24,"If you’re bored of the same 10 shows being recommended I’ll try and provide some fresh options without spoiling anything: 

**First Love** (Netflix Original) - It’s about 2 people who were together in high school finding and them finding each other in their late 30s.

**Acapulco** (Apple TV) - Its about a kid who dreams about working at a wealthy person resort and he finally gets his chance. It’s a funny, easy watch. 

**This is Going to Hurt** (HBO Max/BBC) - Its about a junior doctors day-to-day life and this show is a tough watch. The show is based on a memoir and the author wrote the show as well.

**Karen Pirie** (Amazon) - A detective decides to look into a cold case regarding a murder. It’s 3 episodes. 

**The Future Diary (Season 1)** (Netflix) - It’s a “dating show”. The premise is that 2 people have to act out what this diary says (The diary of how they fell in love). So they will be given a page of the diary which will say “during their first date the man pushes the car up the hill because the engine stops working. When they reach the top they look over the horizon”. It’s definitely worth a watch. You can fast forward through the shows panel discussions."

The ""it"" show that wasn't because it released 15 years too early"
24,"Just finished Mr. robot and that show really ran me through the emotional cycle of joy, anger, happiness, witty, awkward, funny. Truly a phenomenal show with great writing and extraordinary acting from a great cast."
24,"Just watched the **Party Down** premiere, really great, feels like they haven't missed a beat despite ten years between seasons.

Otherwise, continuing my **Succession** rewatch, about halfway through season 2. I feel like my rewatch manifested the news that the show is ending and now i'm sad lol.

**Poker Face** was also really good yesterday, maybe the best crop of guest stars so far? All four of them recognizable despite not being megastars."
24,Derry Girls! Finally got around to watching it after seeing it recommended here. Binged all 3 seasons and absolutely loved it.
24,Just finished **Extraordinary** (Disney) and I bloody adore it. It slightly dropped off in belly laughs towards the end of the season but I think it's terrific and really hope it gets another season. What's more it feels like someone took out my music collection and used it for the show - to the point that it got freaky at times.
24,"Thanks to whoever it was that recommended The Devil's Hour on Prime in last week's thread. I just finished binging and my initial impression is that  it was good! I like how it started out as one genre  (ie horror) with overdone tropes and cliches (which honestly put me off of it at first) then slowly evolved into many other genres that I know and love. The writing and storytelling was engaging. Pacing was fast but didn't give me whiplash and it stayed away from fillers. Female lead was amazing, Jessica Raine is so cute/adorbs. Peter Capaldi was excellent. Overall, worth watching!"
24,"rewatching **Deep Space Nine** because I'm drowning in a sea of mediocrity and felt the need to watch something actually good, consistent, well planned, with amazing characters, acting and writing and the void between this show and whatever comes out today bar a couple examples is massive. Show is just a phenomenal one

**Django** is not bad, but aimless and bland, and with far too many plot threads that I feel will get lost in space before the series' end. Main character gets sidelined too much because of course, *modern audiences*

**Hello Tomorrow!** is a huge missed opportunity, it's so, so safe. Hopefully it picks up steam because I love Billy Crudup and the setting

**Picard season 3.** I swore I wouldn't touch this with a ten foot pole after the first truly dreadful seasons but since the RLM guys watched it and didn't kill themselves I couldn't resist. Not bad, but with a barrage of issues: dialogue that is serviceable at best, strangely poor CGI, no brilliance, no energy, it all feels so bland. Comparing it to the aforementioned DS9 would be simply a war crime, so I won't. I appreciated Stewart's Picard being a bit more awake and proactive here, though, which is already a big difference from the previous seasons where the women dragged him around like a ragdoll"
24,Holy crap party down is hilarious
24,"Watched true blood. I remember watching a few episodes of s1 when it aired here and liking it. Finally, I got around to watch the whole thing. 
Basicaly it's show where main characters are the worst part of it. Town and its people+ Fangtasia are the real stars of the show. 
If the show was just about town and Fangtasia moved in one day. Because the South is a vampire hot spot. It would probably be remembered as one of the great shows of Hbo. 
But it's show about sookie and her magic pussy and it gets old really quickly."

24,Severance for me. Absolutely gripping
24," Just started Andor

After the disappointment of the ST, book of boba Fett and obi wan, THIS is the Star Wars I’ve been looking for"
24,"According to shrinking, i'm getting raw dogged badly every time I go to work."
24,**Chernobyl** - I did not have a good time watching this at all. It's too good at making you feel awful. Knowing that it was real made it so much worse. 9/10.
24,"**Servant** (apple tv+) - last season and I still don't know where it's going

**Shrinking** (apple tv+) - this is a little too sappy for me but I'm still enjoying it. Harrison Ford is actually giving a really good performance lol love the guy but I didn't expect it

**Bel-Air** season 2 (paramount) - second season started and I'm loving it

**The Last of Us** (hbo) - perfect. nothing else to else to say

**How I Met Your Father** season 2 (hulu) - it's SO much better this season. The cast has really found their groove

**Abbott Elementary** season 2 (hulu) - it's just good tv lol nothing else to add

**Outer Banks** season 3 (netflix) - idk how to feel about this show. I'm only three eps into this season though

Only other services I have are amazon and disney+ so if anyone has recs from those services that I'm missing let me know. I have seen all the marvel and star wars shows on disney+ 

(edit: spelling errors)"
24,"Animal Control is...not good. Joel McHale is doing his best, but the show is just bad."
24,Watched Lockwood and Company this week. While you can tell it’s from a YA book series was still a really fun show.  I’m really interested in the whole premise to everything.  Really enjoyed the characters as well.  The season was wrapped up nicely while still leaving things open for later seasons.  Afraid it will get the Netflix treatment though.  Been needing a fun ghost hunter show after Truth Seekers.
24,"Completed Extraordinary. Lots of potential and the comedy is really good. I'm also 5 episodes into White Lotus. Stylistically and visually, its so much better than S1 but in terms of plot and the general theme of rich people doing rich people things, I liked S1 a little better."
24,"I just finished **""Paul T. Goldman""** on peacock. what a strange piece of media! thanks to whoever mentioned it in last week's thread.  It's like The Room met The Rehearsal, and led by this guy who is basically real life Michale Scotts lmao. wild but very entertaining I highly recommend!"
24,"Just finished Cunk on Earth and Cunk on Britain. Both were hilarious! I haven’t laughed this much in a while. Diane Morgan’s deadpan delivery of jokes on serious topics and the experts rolling with it was glorious. As a huge Nathan For You fan, this is exactly what I was looking for. 

Anyone has any recommendations for similar shows with dry humor? 

P.S. I’ve watched What We Do in The Shadows, Wellington Paranormal, IT Crowd, Parks & Recreation, Community, The Office and of course The Rehearsal."
24,I started watching **The Fall**. I’m 4 episodes in and it is riveting!! Very well done too which is important for me otherwise it won’t hold my interest. I’ve known about it for a while but have never found it on my usual streaming services. I found it on Tubi! Free!
24,"Binging Succession .
Just got to the end of season 2.
I am truly addicted. It was a long time I didn't enjoy a show so much.
A bit scary to finish it because don't know what to watch next 😦"
24,"Just watched all of Star Trek Strange New Worlds in one sitting. Enjoyed it quite a bit. Didn’t like the ‘holodeck’ style episode but overall it was a proper trek show and far, far better than the likes of Discovery that I stopped watching."
24,"I've been watching too much ""terrible people"" TV (White Lotus, Succession, Seinfeld), and I need some sort of palate cleanser. Besides the usual suspects, what wholesome comedies could I watch?

By usual suspects, I mean The Office, Parks & Rec, King of the Hill, and Cheers/Frasier. I've seen those already, though I could rewatch them"
24,"Brockmire - Funny, its like Ted Tasso and Loudermilk had a baby.

The Rightful Gemstones - Another good HBO show. Season 1 was a great watch, really interesting. S2 felt played out."
24,"Didn't know where else to ask this.. is there a show-only The Last Of Us discussion thread? The main one is full of spoilers from the games, like ""I can't wait for *this* to happen"" or ""next episode is going to be crazy"""
24,Rewatching Southland.
24,Finally watched Invincible on Prime. Wow what a ride that was!
24,"anyone know what happened to white house plumbers ? 

its removed from hbo’s coming soon list"
24,The first episode of Party Down was great. It felt so natural and tonally picked up where it left off. So good to have it back
24,"I just wanted to thank whoever it was here that recommended In The Loop. It's a movie not TV but it was recommended because it's Armando Iannucci who did The Thick of It and Veep. Incredible cast and of course sharp, fast paced and funny writing. Bravo."
24,Murdaugh Murders on Netflix any good?
24,"What are some of your favourite HBO shows? Shows that you would consider must watch? 

I personally binge watched Justified recently. Definitely one of my favourite all time shows. S1 starts off with a banger. Episode 1 is probably one of the best and one of my favourite episodes and intro to any show. It slows down till about Episode 7 and then it just pulls you in. Raylan Givens is just a pretty cool character. Timothy Olyphant plays him perfectly."
24,"Has anyone seen the premieres of **The Reluctant Traveler,** **The Consultant,** or **Liason?**"
24,"**1923**

While I did like 1883 a bit more than this, I'm really liking this show as well.  It's basically more of what I want from Yellowstone, but mostly more consistent.  I really liked the look at this early look at America, after it's been settled for a while after 1883.

Though that's not to say it's perfect.  Specifically, I thought some of the antagonists were a bit too over-the-top for me, particularly with the banker.  Also, while they're each good in their own ways, the Spencer and Teonna stories being so isolated seemed like an odd choice, though I'm guessing that will change at some point within season 2.

**Legend of Vox Machina**

Season 2 was a great continuation for the series, and in many ways even improved on the first season IMO.  For one thing, they seemed to put more thought into how to incorporate the more edgy humor in a way that doesn't detract as much from the bigger, more serious moments.

Also, I like how they handled the bigger storyline, with the central story being about the dragons, while having certain mini-arcs for a number of the characters.  We get a better understanding of Vax and Vex's history, and how much they mean to each other.  There's also a decent amount of development for Scanlan which I really appreciated, which I hope they continue in season 3.  But for me, Grog was easily the highlight of the season.  There were a couple episodes near the middle where I was a bit worried about the direction they were taking him in, but it really worked out overall.  It was great seeing his history, and the growth he made in the present.  In fact, episode 10 was probably my favorite because of how well they handled his conflict, as well as the fantastic action scene.

Really looking forward to season 3, with everything they've set up at the end of the season.  Hopefully it can continue improving on everything that worked well here."
24,"Looking for recommendations on dark (brightness) shows like Hannibal. I have a worsening brain condition and I noticed some shows are much easier on my eyes. In addition to Hannibal, the Scottish masterpiece Still Game is very easy for me to watch."
24,"Looking for recommendations for my dad. He’s tired of us watching crime procedurals all the time but I think he did like Mare of Eastown. He liked the Expanse and Jack Ryan, but is finding The Last of Us a bit slow right now. He’s a fan of the Bourne movies and Clive Cussler books. Doesn’t have to be new or deep. Just some weeknight entertainment. TIA"
24,"Watched some Party Down on Hulu.  Usually not into comedies but this was pretty damn hilarious.  Not surprising since it’s written and produced by a bunch of big name comedic actors not to mention stars a bunch of them.  Only saw three episodes so far but yes it’s great.


Also watched CB Strike on HBOMAX.  Good show.  About a PI.  Watched first three episodes as well.


Recommend both shows"
24,"**Bad Sisters** (Apple TV+)

Started it this afternoon. On the third episode now and it's slowly gripping up. I think I'll finish it tonight before going to sleep.

Edit: Half way on the season. I must say Apple TV execs clearly have a vision and sense of making good shows.

**Edit 2**: 

Finished the series. *What a ride it was!!!* Without spoiling anything, all i want to say is, the series is so good that i keep forgetting if i am watching a comedy, thriller or a mystery! The writing is that superior! Cast is perfect and the performance..... well... let me just say, i am excited to see what they have for us in Season 2. 

Absolutely recommend to anyone who wants to have a good 10 hours of a story telling experience."
24,"Everyone who haven't watched Mind Hunter, go watch it :)"
24,"so much good tv coming next month.
Succession, Ted lasso, yellowjackets, you part 2, the end of the last of us. i’m so excited"
24,"**Chucky** - I had fairly low expectations for this SyFy Chucky series but it actually turned out to be a pretty fun watch. A solid mix of comedy and slasher horror. Also weirdly dark at times. Glad to see it renewed for a third season. 

**Fleishman is in Trouble** - I was unsure about this limited series in the early stages but it really won me over as it developed and I ended up loving it. It was a dramadey that delivered more emotional moments as it progressed. Fantastic performances from a top notch cast in Clare Danes, Jessie Esienberg, and Lizzy Caplan. This was a quality original feeling series. 

I also managed to squeeze in some episodes of **Law & Order: Criminal Intent**. It reminded me of just how much I love this series. Definitely one of the very best procedural shows. 

Next up I’m going with **The Consultant** and **Outer Banks**."
24,"Drive To Survive - Season 5 on Netflix, as enjoyable as ever, even if you're not a fan of F1. Even my other half who has zero interest in F1 enjoys it. Def recommended."
24,"Started re-watching The Wire on a whim, it's still simply the best."
24,"I just finally finished watching season 3 of Mythic Quest on Apple TV+, and I think it's the best season yet. Some top-notch character work here, and I'm very much looking forward to season 4!"
24,I recommend Drive to Survive. I know it’s a bit exaggerated in how it portrays F1 but this season is really good and I hope F1 can continue to grow in popularity.
24,"I am enjoying Shrinking on Apple+, I am curious about the new season of Party Down and The Never’s finale episodes that were just released. Ah, and I binged the second season of Harlem."
24,"Just finished Guillermo Del Toro's Cabinet of Curiosities. I really dug it, and I'm not that big of a horror fan. Some were better than others, but I didn't think there was a bad episode among them. I especially liked Dreams of the Witch house, Graveyard Rats, and Lot 36, but The Viewing was astounding. It's not going to appeal to everyone, but the mood and tone it conveys is unlike anything I've seen before. Like that light-filled office scene inside Tyrell's pyramid from Blade Runner fused with meditative Trip hop, and gradually dissolving into an 80's homage rendition of a nightmarish bad trip come to life and invading your mind. A character in the episode actually articulates the feeling succinctly: ""It's like having a strange feeling of nostalgia for a place or time that doesn't actually exist."" I'm now excited to check out the director, Panos Cosmatos's other two films he made."
24,"So I've rewatched the second season of **Fleabag**. Maybe I was hoping the find out exactly what this show is trying to tell me. Or why it had to end with just two seasons. One of its best virtues imo is that it's quite unexpected. The situations, the characters, are quite volatile. The ground can collapse beneath you at any time. Anyway, it was a nice rewatch, but I don't think it had to end the way it did. I think there were more aspects of Fleabag to be explored, maybe a more grounded or mature phase of her life.

I was thinking while seeing the last episode of **The Last of Us (1x07)**, that this show is really about trauma. Past trauma, ongoing trauma. It's so much about how the characters navigate their personal emotional lives as it is about the apocalyptic reality they have to deal with. I've read here people dissatisfied with this episode or the other. As far as I'm concerned, their track record so far is pristine, each and every one of them are sensational.

I've also watched the **Sag Awards ceremony**. Idk if this qualifies as tv? It was nice, especially the intervention of James Hong. I like watching these ceremonies as much as anybody, but sometimes I wonder if there's a profession in which people congratulate each other as much as the movie/tv making, spending a couple of months getting together and clapping each other like they just discovered the cure for cancer or something."
24,"Servant: I’m loving this season. I binged the first 3 seasons a month ago and I got a little burned out on the drama but I’m back in it now and the last few episodes were really great, excited to see how they wrap it up. 

Shrinking: watching weekly and I’m really loving it. It’s cute without being too sappy and it has heart. 

Our Flag Means Death: just finished my second rewatch in a row and I looooved it. Can’t wait for season 2. 

Arrested Development: on as background noise, probably my 100th rewatch, the first 3 seasons are gold. The last 2 are watchable but trying to get it in before they are taken off of Netflix. 

What We Do in the Shadows: another background noise feel good show, watched a few episodes from the 1st season in the bath tonight. 

Recently finished: Severance - fucking amazing show. I already want to rewatch. 
Station 11 - so multilayered and beautiful, I enjoyed so much of this show. 
Psych - just rewatched all the seasons and watched the movies for the first time. That shit holds up! C’mon son!"
24,Starting **BOSCH**
24,"Still very much look forward to weekly drops of **The Last Of Us** and **Poker Face** and still have very much enjoyed each episode.

**True Detective** - I went through all three seasons this week. Season 1, I now understand why this is in everyone's top 10 season of all time. Amazing perfect storm of writing, acting, directing. Matthew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson were a joy to watch. Season 2... definitely does not compare to S1. I still enjoyed overall it but I did not like the ending so much. Season 3, I though was better than S2 overall. Plodding at times and the 3 timelines were a tad bit much at times. Mahershala Ali and Stephen Dorff definitely carried the show. They were so good in it. Very much looking forward to S4, huge fan of Jodie Foster.

**The White Lotus** - I'm on S1E3 now and so far all the characters make my skin crawl (except Armond), but I can't stop watching."
24,"Shadow and Bone - Netflix 

If you’re a fantasy fan and somehow missed this show you’ll love it.  

I am currently watching it for the 4th time,  it checks all the boxes, strong story, smart writing, great cast and characters, amazing production, beautiful cinematography, and the soundtrack is original and adds a lot to the show.  It all just makes a strong show. Season 2 premieres March 16th!"
24,"I slept on *Only Murders in the Building*.

If you did, stop. Watch.

It's not perfect, but it's incredibly good and the *writing* is phenomenal. We seem to be short on good writing in TV right now, so if that particular pain hurts you, *Only Murders* is a soothing balm."
24,Snowfall Season 6. Shaping up to be a great final season
24,"Wolf Pack. I need something to not care about, and laugh at. This seems like it will fit the bill."
24,"Really enjoying season 6 of snowfall.  Felt like last season was kinda slow, but now it's coming all together."
24,"Watching Weekly: **The Last of Us S1** and **Your Honor S2.**

The Last of Us (HBO) is killing it every week very excited for the rest of the season!

Finished Binging: **Stolen Youth: Inside the Cult at Sarah Lawrence** a 3 part doc on Hulu about a con man who manipulates and abuses his daughter's college friends/roommates. I knew nothing about this case so it was an eye-opener. I do think his daughter should have had some punishment as she was the one who introduced him to her roommates.

Also finished: **Murder in Big Horn** on Showtime a 3 part doc about the epidemic of missing/murdered indigenous women in the US. This is an essential watch I'd highly recommend.

Also watched: **Still Missing Morgan** a documentary about missing Morgan Nick who has been missing since 1995 after being abducted at a little league game. The doc follows investigators as they try to solve the cold case in 2020. This was an interesting doc. I'd recommend.

Yet to start:

* **Tokyo Vice s1.**
* **The 12th Victim.**"
24,"Still watching West Wing, on season 4.

Yesterday I watched the first 6 episodes of  Shrinking and I really love it! Very witty. I laughed so many times. Harrison Ford is so great.

Watched the first 2 episodes of s6 of Snowfall. It's heating up."
24,">After bailing on the show when it was originally airing, I just binged HBO's Perry Mason. I actually liked the first few episodes (before he became a lawyer) to the latter half of the season. The show lost a lot of momentum for me at that point. I'm bummed because the show is right up my alley, but it was a disappointment. I'm still going to tune into season 2."
24,"I’ve recently watched Mad Men (finally), Ted Lasso, Abbott Elementary, and Extraordinary and highly recommend all of them!  Great binges"
24,Mayor of Kingstown is popping off this week.
24,"mando s3 starts today so we have double pedro pascal every week, nice"
24,"The Daily Show with Hasan Minhaj guest hosting.

Holy shit he is absolutely crushing it. I haven't properly laughed while watching TDS in ages.

However much money it would cost to make this guy a permanent host, it should be paid."
24,Anyone got good documentary recommendations?
24,Watched 3 seasons of **Bosch** in less than a week. Soo good man
24,How lucky am I? I just realized that life got in the way and I never watched the last five episodes of **Ted Lasso**
24,"Episode 3 of The Last of Us has almost 200,000 ratings on IMDb. That's more than Ozymandias - the best episode of Breaking Bad. Good lord. 

GoT's series finale has 250k ratings. I don't know what else could be that high."
24,"Started watching **Bob's Burgers** on Disney+ and genuinely surprised by how funny it is, like Gene convincing his dad that Salman Rushdie wrote The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe. Such a stupid joke but him saying he looked it up and Bob was wrong made it so much better."
24,"Finished watching **Olive Kitteridge**. A brilliant underrated show. I loved Frances McDormand’s performance. 



Watched the latest episodes of **Poker Face** and **Abbott Elementary**. Great as usual. 



Just started **Landscapers**."
24,"**Wolf Pack** - *Definitely* not going to be for everyone. The acting is a bit cringe in the early episodes and the cgi pretty trash but supernatural/fantasy YA genre stuff is my guilty pleasure. It's got werewolves. And Sarah Michelle Gellar. Inject that shit right into my veins.


**Carnivale Row** - Going to start this one as I love fantasy per the above and seen some mentions of it due to new season.


Other Weekly Watches: Last of Us, Poker Face, Mayfair Witches. Plenty of commentary on the first two. Was thinking I'd enjoy Mayfair much more than I am but it's pretty mid. Will still finish it."
24,okay this season of outer banks was actually not bad
24,"Poker face ep 7 was just avg for me, but 8 was really great! The guest actors did an amazing job , especially Nick Nolte"
24,"Wow I just watched the first episode of The Glory and I read that the bullying scenes are quite something but I still wasn't prepared😥  

Also the first episode of The Mandalorian seemed a bit off to me, not sure what it was."
24,"You - Welcome to season 4, where people never look out their window!!! I'm 3 episodes in, it's good, but not as good as previous seasons imo. Hopefully it gets better."
24,"Last of us, as a big fan of the games, specially Tlou pt2, i was blown away by the quality of literally everything 

Homeland, I’m halfway through the first season, i find it really compelling."
24,"Right now: Last of Us, Poker Face

Next week: Mando

Next month: Succession

Binging:  **Farscape** 

This is a rewatch, my first time since its original airdate. I'm in the middle of the hit and miss first season, but being patient as I know it gets real good. This is a big deal for me, as I never rewatch things these days. But all my fave current shows are weeklies, and I couldn't find anything new to me that I can watch daily.

Once I finish Farscape, I might check out some other old faves. X-Files, BSG, or Buffy/Angel. We'll see what happens."
24,"Is ""The Devil's hour"" any good?"
24,"Everything that worked for me in the first two seasons of **Outer Banks** seems to be gone in season 3. I'm on episode 3 or 4, I'll probably give it one more chance then drop it."
24,"Second episode of Animal Control.

Solid outing.  I'm really rooting for this show because it's exactly the type of show I spend most weeks of the year wishing I had a new episode of.   It's clearly kind of aiming to be The Office meets Brooklyn 99.

The cast is mostly serviceable, but need to grow into their characters some.  The premise is silly, but they are doing a decent job with pacing, storylines, and gags within that premise.  The editing is rough, as is the camera work.  And the extreme shaky cam in some places was absolutely horrific.  They also tried to squeeze 1-2 many scenes into this episode.  

All that said, I chuckled and started warming up to 90% of the cast, and I'm eager for the next episode.


It's early in the series to make a statement like this, but it kind of feels like a Parks and Rec season 1 situation.  If they can make it to season 2, make a few changes, and find their stride, this could become a gem of a show."
24,"The Pacific, really good"
24,"Finished f1 dts season5 and that was fun to see the behind the scenes footage. Always funny to check the f1 subreddit and see how the show amped up more drama for some things.  

Excited for march! new succession and mandalorian"
24,The Consultant - the first 4 episodes really had me hooked but the ending is really bad. Nothing makes sense or is consistent throughout the show.
24,"i’m watching a lot of comedies right now, party down, ted lasso, abott etc. do any of these shows stick out as something i should watch for dramas? i’ve finished most of the great tv suggestions here. Dope sick, Blackbird, queens gambit, station 11 and dark"
24,boondocks still holds up man i like it
24,Well I just finished the Shield Season 1. I am old enough to remember when it aired but never got around to watching it. The first few episodes weren't really doing it for me but for the last 5 or so I was watching back-to-back. Pretty good so far and I hope it only gets better.
24,is dope sick good?
24,"Bad sisters- I'm hooked to the show.I hate John Paul so much!!! I can't wait to see his death scene


Fleishman is in trouble- I love this show.Cast's performance are amazing."
24,"Last of us. Nice to see Pedro Pascal shine

Shrinking is really funny and beautiful. It's my favorite weekly show

Ginny and Georgia is very average but I'm a sucker for Gilmore girls so this only seems natural progression

Finished one season of banshee. A lot of mindless fun. Man made enemy of everyone in a town of fifteen people

Extraordinary is really funny. Honestly couldn't stop laughing at the butt guy

Hello Tomorrow is a beautiful world. But there is literally nothing else in it. Very disappointed"
24,"Station Eleven.

Far more pretentious/thematic/high art than Id normally fo for, and the time jumps were sometimes pretty hard to follow.

But DAMN of that wasnt a frickin class piece of television. Absolutely phenomenal acting.  Beautifully put together.

Tbh a lot of it probably went over my head.  Im just not intelligent enough to fully grasp something this high brow.  But I had a good time trying to.

Much more tangible in terms of actual plot than something like the leftovers ar least."
24,"Black Bird - a bit late to the party but really enjoying this. Paul Walter Hauser’s performance is going to haunt me long after I’ve finished watching I’m sure. 

The Last of Us - catching up on this and haven’t seen the latest yet but really liking it so far. It’s incredibly bleak but also quite uplifting and funny at times, which I appreciate. 

Ghosts (US) - giving this a try, not as good as the UK series yet but it’s been a while since I’ve watched a network sitcom and the sheer amount of episodes has me weirdly excited. 

The Curse (BBC) - watched the first episode of this comedy by the People Just Do Nothing guys. So far not much to write home about - usual brand of awkward comedy but not massively funny. 

Industry (Season 2) - definitely better than the first but still finding it a bit of a slog. Think it’s mostly because I really struggle with most of the primary characters. Will finish though as only 2 eps to go. 

HIMYM (Season 8) - been a long time since I last watched this and I remembered it being a lot worse. Still some funny moments. Will be interested to see if Season 9 is still as bad as I remember. 

Extraordinary - just finished this, felt like a British teen version of The Boys which isn’t necessarily a bad thing. Liked it a lot more than I thought I would and will definitely watch a second season.

Bad Sisters - also just finished this - could have done with being condensed to six episodes, 10 really was a stretch. Would still recommend though, mostly for the performances. If you like Dead to Me, this is probably worth it."
24,"I watched the first season of Reservation Dogs. I really like it  so far! Especially episode 7 was great. I thought the show was good before, but that episode blew me away. >!the scene where Elora discovers Daniels  body broke me and made me cry so much. Also really good performance by the actress. I was surprised how much this show could make me cry!< 

Really enjoy how this show can be so funny, but also serious and sad.  I'm definitely looking forward for season 2"
24,"Caught up on The Last of Us and enjoyed it.

Had fun watching the mockumentary Cunk on Earth."
24,"**Carnival Row Ep 3-4:** Not great, not terrible.  Probably much more palatable if you're a fan of this kind of fantasy.  I'm finding Cara Delevingne's character more and more unreasonable and annoying, and they spent a lot of time on one storyline that I don't care a lot about.

**The Last of Us Ep 7:** Probably the weakest of the season so far.  Having *two* entire episodes dedicated to deep story flashbacks and not advancing the plot in such a short series is pretty frustrating.  I felt this one didn't really create the kind of emotional impact that it was going for.

**Picard S3 Ep 1-2:** So far, so good.  When you have such a short series or movies you really need a story that packs more of a punch and leans harder on the spectacle of ships in space and the sci-fi aspect instead of just running around doing things that could be in hundreds of non-Star Trek shows.  So definitely better than the previous seasons so far, but the quality of the story is a bit iffy right now and the show still suffers a bit from the main actors being so old now and barely able to move and yet it's a script that calls for some physical action.

**Sherlock S1 (rewatch):** This is a series I had no intention of watching because I was put off by the premise of the very modern-seeming take on a classic character from another time.  Then I happened to catch one-off episode where he is ""back in time"" and I found the characters and chemistry was so compelling that it really didn't matter even if it was changed, and the show just seemed so fun.  So now I am re-enjoying the magic from the first couple of seasons and I love it just as much as the first time.  The Sherlock-Watson bromance is one of the best I have ever seen on screen."
24,"**1923:**
Just finished season 1 and I loved every minute of it. I think world building was awesome and I loved the Spencer-Alex storyline even though it's not my favourite type of storyline. I just wish it only had 2 more episodes.

**Justified:**
I'm on season 5 and it only gets better. I'm already sad I will soon finish it.

Did anyone else here watch That Dirty Black Bag? Thinking of starting it"
24,"I'm a bit of a TV addict and love following this thread. I see a lot of people asking for recommendations for comedies with fantasy, supernatural or sci-fi elements, but struggling to express exactly what they mean! I'm realising these recs actually fall under the specific sub-genre Fantasy Comedy, so I made a sub for it: r/FantasyComedy. If you're one of those people who love speculative fiction, asking the real questions like ""how would vampires survive in this day and age?"" or ""what if we all had superpowers?"" come join r/FantasyComedy for a chat!"
24,"**The Last of Us** I'm liking it a lot, but I also don't think it's as good as the current hype. I'll probably get crucified considering the unending astroturfing for the show lol... Every episode has been episodic, and quite a few of the plots are disjointed. It generally has a video gamey feel, which isn't inherently bad, but it kind of takes me out of it when the camera does something like a shakey zoom on a zombie that roars at the camera. I'm seeing a lot of comments on Reddit saying it's already way better than The Walking Dead, but I'd easily put seasons 1 and 3-5 above this. I'm probably feeling like an **8-8.5** right now for LoU

Minor spoilers: >!nearly every episode is based around introducing a character that bonds with the MCs that inevitably dies in a drawn-out emotional scene (usually from a sneaky bite that the MCs don't notice right away)!<"
24,"If you were into Orphan Black, check out Triptych on Netflix. 

Really have enjoyed the first 3 episodes"
Sofia the First,"Excerpt:

>HBO’s The Last Of Us hit a milestone this week, notching its first billion-minute week since it debuted in January. With five [actually 4] episodes available, the post-apocalyptic series jumped 36% vs. the last interval to notch 1.2B minutes and fourth place overall. Nielsen streaming measurements only account for viewing on HBO Max, so these numbers don’t reflect any viewership on HBO’s linear channel (HBO hasn’t released updated viewership numbers for the series since Episode 4).  
>  
>Perhaps unsurprisingly, Nielsen asserts that the audience profile for The Last Of Us is virtually identical to The Walking Dead, skewing younger and more male.

Numbers are for US only and counts all episodes across all seasons of a show.

1st week: 223 million minutes (just a few hours availability)

2nd week: 837 million minutes

3rd week: 877 million minutes

4th week: 1190 million minutes"
Sofia the First,Only a billion? Cancel it.
Sofia the First,I'm getting more and more concerned that Ellie won't throw a brick at anyone this season
Sofia the First,"This is the perfect example of, people like well written shows. It’s not that complicated."
Sofia the First,"Gonna stream episode 6 tonight.

Such a wonderful, heartbreaking, show."
Sofia the First,"As a 90s kid who grew up with the Super Mario Bros movie, it's absolutely *wild* that the most popular show on TV is based off of a video game.

It's even more crazy than when Spiderman (and to a lesser extent, the first X-man movie) made comic book movies not suck."
Sofia the First,I might’ve been the Billionth Minute! I just started watching last week.
Sofia the First,"I have been enjoying the show and think it has pretty high quality.

But I also think it is doing really well right now because there is really not much competition.   

There just has not been much really great from the last 2 months, IMHO."
Sofia the First,So far it’s doing good. The game is always more intimate but the show has a different aspect that I enjoy. Some flaws but I’ll let it slide.
Sofia the First,"I’m interested to see what general audiences think of it. I’m fan of the game and while I like the show it does feel simultaneously rushed while not fleshing things out enough. 

It feels like Joel/Ellie haven’t had proper scenes apart from episodes 4 and 6 (which was my second favourite episode). Ironically my favourite episode was 3 which was a brand new ‘side story’.

Episode 7 was great quality but it’s kind of a shame they spent a ninth of the show on DLC backstory. I have no clue how they will do the next arc in a single episode considering it’s the best part of the game."
Sofia the First,"Services need to stop acting like the duration that something is watched matters, tell us how many times an episode was viewed... this could just be a billion people watch 1 minute and stop. That's not the same as somebody actually watching the episode. It needs to be how many accounts watch the full damn episode."
Sofia the First,"Man, I like this show a lot but I had to leave the HBOshow sub.. they’re fucking evangelical over there, shits getting crazy! It’s like a cult!"
Sofia the First,">	‪""unsurprisingly, Nielsen asserts that the audience profile for The Last Of Us is virtually identical to The Walking Dead, skewing younger and more male.""‬

‪Lol, I knew the walking dead fans that got sick of the show's shit would come through! Welcome to quality! AMC could never & now, they end up looking like the Wii U window meme. Couldn't have happen to ""better"" company."
Sofia the First,Deserved. The witcher show could learn a thing or two.
Sofia the First,"it's good that it took a massively popular, successful, genre defining, and industry standard setting video game for a streaming service to finally get close to netflix. not to mention the constant enriched media blitz that this sub seems to hate for everything else but not last of us, very curious"
Sofia the First,"Congrats to them. They’ve made a phenomenal show that has stayed true to the much beloved IP while still adding to the world i ways that make intuitive sense. 

Definitely in my top 5 shoes of all time."
Sofia the First,Hmmmm - old boomer here!  Female!  Not a gamer!  I absolutely love TLOU!  I’m going to go with I’m young at heart!
Sofia the First,"I can't wait to watch this!

I'm waiting until all the episodes are out so i can spend one entire weekend watching it."
Sofia the First,"My girlfriend doesn’t want to watch the series because “there are zombies”, how do I persuade her to watch it?"
Sofia the First,"Other than the sniper and the museum episodes, this show’s been kinda stale tbh. Not enough fungi zombies. Feels like they skip over a lot of the anxiety that the game gives you and just try to quick hit the emotional beats—which don’t really hit because there was no real journey between them. Just my opinion. Found myself browsing my phone the last two episodes, which isn’t a good sign since I usually stay fully engaged when watching other series. Over hyped at this point and I don’t think they’ve developed Joel and Ellie’s relationship well enough for the final two episodes to work as well as they could’ve."
Sofia the First,This games deserves to have the best video game adaptation of all time. Well done
Sofia the First,lol you guys are going to be so pissed when they get to the ending of the first game.
Sofia the First,"Ok a billion minutes, I get it. I mean that's a unit of measurement we're all used to, something everyone uses frequently. But how many swimming pools is that? Because I'm still a little confused, it's difficult to really grasp the scope of it using this unit of measurement.

Like how many giraffes is that? If someone could explain it in terms of bushels of oranges or something that would really help to put it in perspective."
Sofia the First,Love the show but damn did I hate this latest episode (full rounds of mortal combat…) get to the POINT and cut this cheesy nonsense out
Sofia the First,"Still waiting for the whole season. Fuck the weekly release model, it sucks."
Sofia the First,Wakanda forever being the most streamed movie last week should be the headline.
Sofia the First,Netflix would cancel it after hearing this.
Sofia the First,Last episode was awfully boring
Sofia the First,Are we really doing this every time? Most of the people want their minutes back after the last episode
Sofia the First,It’s basically the walking dead meets the road but with a girl instead of boy
Sofia the First,It’s crazy that we live in a world of so much content that I can entirely ignore one of the biggest shows ever and not feel a thing about it.
Sofia the First,"They don’t want to focus on Joel and Ellie. 

You know why and they needed to soften the blow"
Sofia the First,"I can believe it. HBO Max app wouldn't play it. I had to pirate it. I had to do the same thing for House of the  Dragon. I'm just glad my subscription is free through my ISP. I wouldn't pay for their garbage.

Good show though."
Sofia the First,"It’s not a very good show, pretty mediocre popcorn fare"
Sofia the First,"Woulda been a good show if it was actually about Ellie and Joel and not about literally everyone else around them. Again just put the game onto the screen, but writers can't seem to follow through"
Sofia the First,"I’m pretty fucking smart woman, but I have no idea what the fuck this means"
Sofia the First,"Get woke? Go broke.

The *RATINGS*, that is!"
Sofia the First,"Thank god good shit still get recognized ! Remeber this before next season and everyone tries to politicize a fictional show . 
Let’s enjoy"
Sofia the First,What’s with the black panther?
Sofia the First,It helps that the game was kind of a movie.
Sofia the First,Pretty darn impressive considering how mid the show actually is.
Sofia the First,[deleted]
Sofia the First,I don't get the love for the show. I can barely get through an episode. I'm at Ep 5 and not sure I'll even finish the season.
Sofia the First,What show?
Sofia the First,Fell off hard after 2 stellar episodes
Sofia the First,Goblin
Sofia the First,That scene where they shoot the deaf black kid at point blank range turned me off. Capitalism is such a psycho!
Sofia the First,[removed]
Sofia the First,"Just curious, was this from the week when an episode aired early to avoid competing with the super bowl? So there was technically 2 episodes in one week? Still impressive numbers all around, but I'm not sure its an apples to apples comparison to other weeks."
Sofia the First,I wonder how similar the audience profile is with *Stranger Things* \- Joel and Ellie are rather similar to Jim and Eleven after all...
Sofia the First,Minutes. Not hours. Minutes.
Sofia the First,Black panther 2 was amazing. Happy it’s doing great on streaming!
Sofia the First,Good things get audiences.
Sofia the First,You heard it here first. I'm younger and more male.
Sofia the First,Using minutes for the metric is silly. Just round to the nearest half hour.
Sofia the First,What's that in parsecs?
Sofia the First,"> HBO hasn’t released updated viewership numbers for the series since Episode 4

I was wondering about this. I remember reading that they had consistent viewer growth for the first 4 episodes, and that many other shows, even really popular ones, don't typically experience that.  
  
All speculation but I wonder if 5 had particularly disappointing numbers because of the odd release date due to the clash with the super bowl, and after all the hype about the viewership growth they didn't want to put that out there and have people start questioning if the drop in numbers meant a drop in quality - which certainly isn't the case."
Sofia the First,Some of TWD spinoffs have been less than stellar. TLOU feel more like what TWD spinoffs should have been
Sofia the First,That's a staggering amount of human energy when you look at it that way.
Sofia the First,Six episodes available
Sofia the First,"WD overlap, of course, but why more male?"
Sofia the First,Calm down Netflix
Sofia the First,I’d be pretty sad if she settled for a bottle
Sofia the First,"I vividly remember that E3 presentation pre-launch (2012 or 2013) where they showed some gameplay, and the scene where Ellie threw a brick at a dude's head was one of the biggest applause moments of the video."
Sofia the First,Home Alone 4; lost in the midwest
Sofia the First,"People don't want lore accurate stories or characters. They want our shitty version of an already far more popular gaming IP

- Halo series producers probably"
Sofia the First,Please point me to an example of the well written show...
Sofia the First,is r/grammargore a thing?
Sofia the First,[removed]
Sofia the First,"I feel like the deaths happen so fast, we do t have time to actually care about the character. Which is good for the heart."
Sofia the First,">It's even more crazy than when Spiderman (and to a lesser extent, the first X-man movie) made comic book movies not suck.

This is *Batman and Robin* slander and I will NOT stand for it"
Sofia the First,"I hope that Last of Us is the Spider-Man/X-Men of video game content and we get an influx moving forward, and not the Superman/Batman that just stands out among the crap."
Sofia the First,"Games are so different now though. Last of Us, God of War, Uncharted, etc. are basically interactive novels."
Sofia the First,"Little context but it's not the most popular show on TV. Network TV (ABC, CBS, NBC, etc) is still more popular as a whole. Even on streaming only it was still second behind New Amsterdam.

NCIS, for example, will do ~600M minutes in a week on one episode vs the five episodes for TLOU.

Not trying to take away from the accomplishment, it's still a popular show, and I'm delighted that it's helping video games get positive attention."
Sofia the First,"I have a very weird love for the original 1993 Super Mario Bros. Movie. It's objectively not a good movie, but it's so batshit crazy that it makes it enjoyable to watch (at least for me). The pacing is also surprisingly good which is weird to say. It's no where near the quality of The Last of Us, but it's definitely not on the same level as the god awful Double Dragon movie, Alone in the Dark, or anything directed by Uwe Boll. And if you read up on the making of that film it's a miracle we even got a completed movie to watch in the first place."
Sofia the First,I got news for you bud. Super Mario Bros is about to be the biggest movie of April and just might be the first billion dollar release of 2023
Sofia the First,"Get ready for the tidal wave of game adaptations coming to film and TV. Out goes all the superhero spin offs, in comes the video games"
Sofia the First,🎈
Sofia the First,"Craig Maizin (because of Chernobyl) and the IP brought in enough curious people that the rave reviews after caused an explosion of good word of mouth


Competition or no, it's earned its place IMO"
Sofia the First,">There just has not been much really great from the last 2 months, IMHO.

acting like milf manor doesn't exist smh"
Sofia the First,Or its just a really good show that people here on reddit feel like they need to nitpick the shit out of.
Sofia the First,Couldn’t have said it better myself. HBO doesn’t have anything else going for them so they’re throwing it all at TLOU right now. I think that and Pedro Pascal starring in The Mandalorian has a huge impact on viewership off the bat.
Sofia the First,The Mandalorian literally just came back though with the exact same lead. That show is absolutely competition. It is incredibly fucking popular
Sofia the First,"what is competition in the age of streaming? anyone can watch anything at any time. It's not like they are competing for a time slot and audience needs to watch one vs the other 

The show is incredibly well written, directed and acted. It's a success no matter what."
Sofia the First,"Yeah it’s been quiet, looks like it’s really ramping up this month though, last year March till November was pretty solid, there was always something good on, hopefully this year is the same"
Sofia the First,"Well in the UK we had series 3 of Happy Valley, which was excellent and I reckon better than The Last of Us by a decent bit"
Sofia the First,"I think this is doing the best possible version of the show that could’ve been, the game will always be more intimate to me because there’s sections of that game where you walk for ages and stop to read notes and have these optional conversations, to not bore the audience because your not playing they have to reduce these moments, in terms of making people care about these characters, getting the lore of the world, and getting all the major emotional beats of the game, the show has done a tremendous job"
Sofia the First,can you explain what you mean by the game being more intimate?
Sofia the First,"From conversations with my friends who haven't played it, they basically liked all the episodes though the last one was probably the weakest.

They really liked Sam and Henry and didn't like Kathleen.

But every single one loved the Bill and Frank episode. Even the ones who generally aren't pro-LGBT but not against it either. It's their favourite episode by far."
Sofia the First,"Honestly I don't think it'll be too difficult to cover, when you factor in that most of that time in the game is gameplay. And obviously in the show they're not gonna have Ellie mowing down dozens of infected and >!David's men!< By herself when it hasn't been established that she can do that. And also >!Joel's portion is mostly just him walking around looking for Ellie then the interrogation scene happens!<


Edit: I just looked it up on YouTube and there's a video that shows pretty much the entire winter arc from beginning to end and without the big gameplay sections, it's less than 30 minutes long"
Sofia the First,"I'm a big fan of the games. I loved episode 3, and to a lesser extent episode 7. But I feel like with such a low episode count they really take away from the Joel and Ellie time this story needs to completely land. I'm listening to the official podcast and the showrunners go on and on about how much Joel and Ellie now truly, deeply love each other and consider each other family and I'm like ""What? When did that happen?"". The show hasn't done much to show that transformation at all. Well, less than the game at least. So I wonder if the non game players are getting that same feeling."
Sofia the First,"I’ve been watching with my parents who know absolutely nothing about the game. They’re enjoying it, but they feel like it seems slow. They also don’t really get what the whole point or real conflict is. They’re like, “okay, this guy has the girl and she has the cure or whatever. But what’s the real story here?” To them, it just feels like a pretty standard post apocalypse zombie show that doesn’t really set itself apart, other than it being very well made.

I do agree with their some of their points honestly. The pacing can feel a bit slow, and the “point” of it all can seem a bit unclear. I can definitely get why some in the general audience see it as a fairly boiler part zombie show so far. To me, the focus is on the characters though, and not the zombie shit. And I think the characters have been great so far, so I’m happy with  it."
Sofia the First,"I don't know if I count as a general audience member, but having never played the game, but I feel the same way. It's a fine show, but the pacing is strange - it has the feel of a character drama, but with the pacing what it is, it doesn't linger long enough on these characters to allow whatever emotional connections there are to marinate; there's an odd empty feeling I get from watching the show. The bond between Joel/Ellie hasn't landed with me either because there hasn't been much meaningful interaction between them, not enough for their big conflict in episode 6 to feel genuine, I guess. The show seems to do alot of ""telling,"" and not ""showing."" Otherwise, it's fine."
Sofia the First,"I feel like a contrarian saying this but honestly I think it's paced really badly. Every episode feels like ""story of the week"" without any real sense of urgency. And it's like they've lost something, a sense of tension or something, by removing most of the violence and horror that's in the game."
Sofia the First,"> It feels like Joel/Ellie haven’t had proper scenes apart from episodes 4 and 6 (which was my second favourite episode). Ironically my favourite episode was 3 which was a brand new ‘side story’.

Joel is already feeling the situation similar to Sarah at the end of Episode 1 when he kills the guard.  So that connection is already there in his mind.  They go through a traumatic experience together in Episode 2.  There is a lot of time with Joel and Ellie in Episode 3 that I think a lot of people tend to forget and Ellie is already getting through to him by the end of that episode.  And Bill's letter also strikes a nerve as well.

In Episode 4, they spend a ton of time together.  Joel is already playing protector by not sleeping and standing guard.  Ellie has to save Joel's life and he apologizes to her.  She gets him to laugh by the end of the episode.  The whole situation with Henry and Sam in Episode 5 is a shared experience by them.

The show skips 3 months, but it shows us an update on their relationship with how their dynamic is in the house with the couple, the campfire scene, and through to when they get to and are in Jackson.

After Jackson, that is when Joel has fully committed to the father/daughter relationship.  He has decided to open himself up to that possibility of feeling that pain of loss again.

A lot of what is going on between them is nonverbal.  The show doesn't spell it out for the most part.  It is very much about showing through action, and through showing the actor's faces.

That being said, you can't really look at this like some kind of equation where the characters need a certain amount of time together.  Heck, you can establish a relationship with one really good scene.  And movies have been doing a lot with relationships within the 2 hour window since forever."
Sofia the First,"I think once the hype settles down, most will agree that while it's good, it's very overrated.

I agree with you on it feeling rushed and somewhat shallow.

When you have such a low episode count, it would have been better to focus on Joel and Ellie."
Sofia the First,I'm hoping the last two episodes will be especially long.
Sofia the First,The show does way more showing then telling. Not sure you understand what that phrase means.
Sofia the First,"I have to say that I've found the series to a bit of a mixed bag. Most of the episodes have have been excellent and it's pretty damn rewarding to see a series based on a game stick this close to the source material.

But I'm going to go against the grain on this one and say that I found episode 3 to worst of the lot so far, not to say that it was bad by any means. It started out strong but just didn't add anything to story or even really flesh out the world. So to me it felt like wasted time. I got to the end and was like ""What was the point of that?"" We see, what? 5 minutes worth of Joel and Ellie.

And episode 7 was the same kind of deal, but to it's credit, it managed to recapture how I felt playing the Stand Alone DLC. It was just boring, you spend the whole time waiting for something to happen and then when it finally does, it's over in minutes and you go back to meh.

Don't get me wrong, I like the series over all I think it's great. But as I'm scrolling through this thread I'm seeing a common theme. That it feels rushed, and that the relationship between Ellie and Joel feels unearned. Well these two episode would have been great opportunities to flesh that stuff out, instead we got side stories.

Edit: This is why I don't like this sub sometimes. You try to talk about the good and the bad and you end up downvoted. There's no room for conversation because people just want an echo chamber."
Sofia the First,"Couldn’t have said it better my self. Rushed and not developed at the same time. Season one needed 14-16 episodes IMO to truly match the emotions of the game. The world feels very empty and honestly not that dangerous. The 3 month timeline jump just didn’t feel right. They still acted like strangers even after all the time spent on the road. 

I don’t have high expectations for the remaining 2 episodes. Between Chernobyl and Station Eleven, I hoped HBO would do justice to the first game but I guess I over estimated how easy it would be to pull off."

Wakfu,*Disenchantment* from Netflix is entertaining
Wakfu,"If you like *Star Trek: Prodigy,* you may want to find [*Trollhunters*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2oNgZlbSKI) on Netflix. The creators/showrunners of *Prodigy,* Kevin and Dan Hageman, have [most of the story writing credits on *Trollhunters*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trollhunters:_Tales_of_Arcadia#Season_1_(2016))*,* which was showrun by Guillermo del Toro and Marc Guggenheim.  And two of the other *Trollhunter* writers, Chad Quandt and Aaron Waltke are also working on *Prodigy.*

As a sidenote, A.C. Bradley who also wrote for *Trollhunters* and *3 Below* is now head writer on *What If...?* and she also worked on *Ms. Marvel.*

*Trollhunters* was so successful, Netflix decided to expand it into the Tale of Arcadia franchise, which includes [*3 Below*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfVmNGUA-eo), [*Wizards*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6adVDTR79n4), and [*Rise of the Titans*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H4Y21Hg2L8)."
Wakfu,Hilda was great. I heard there will be a final season even after the movie.
Wakfu,"Cool, I’ll check it out. Thanks for the suggestion."
Wakfu,Underrated show for sure
Wakfu,"The fight between Nox and Grougaloragran is one of the best I’ve seen in an animated TV show. 

I love *Wakfu*’s art style and animation. I’ve wondered why *The Dragon Prince* couldn’t have emulated *Wakfu* in that regard, because *TDP*’s animation leaves a bit to be desired (rather choppy frame rate at times)."
Wakfu,Wakfu is my favorite foreign animated show ever.
Wakfu,"I was really hoping they were going to renew for season 4 but I dont think there was enough views , there is alot of hidden comedy and a compelling story really close to avatar like the op suggested"
Wakfu,Isn't this a MMORPG as well?
Wakfu,"Great show with some awesome character building. Definitely watch the French dub, the English is... well..."
Wakfu,I watched this because I liked Avatar and heard it compared but I recall being confused the plot and not enjoying the characters. The assassin/master magic old man or so thing was all rather fuzzy iirc.
Wakfu,"The season one villain was great.  Dude wasn't *really* evil, he honestly believed his actions didn't have consequences."
Wakfu,"This show and The Dragon Prince are tops on our kids’ Netflix preferences! No big surprise that they both have some Avatar “DNA” involved, they’re both great (and beautiful)."
Wakfu,"Oh. I didn’t realize it was an actual show, and not just a...never mind."
Wakfu,Yeah the choppy animation was really off-putting. Wakfu is able to incorporate subtle 3D elements the right away while being a primarily 2D show.
Wakfu,"Yes, I believe it’s a successor to Dofus. I played the open beta years ago before they went pay-to-play model. I believe it’s still semi-active now days. I have seen it on Steam."
Wakfu,I was too into the show to realize how...not great Ruel and Dally's voices sounded. They eventually grew on me to the point where the wacky voices embodied the characters.
Wakfu,Yeah the first arc of season 1 is them getting to a destination and having adventures on the way which can muddle the plot. The antagonist appears pretty sparingly so I can see why it'd be fuzzy.
Wakfu,"Oh, that... 

...needs a sequel."
Wakfu,"A 2D show that looks 3D, if that makes any sense 😂"
Wakfu,I really recommend this show if you like animated stuff.
Wakfu,"I've heard good things about this show. Hasn't it been a while since it's gotten a new season though?
"
Wakfu,"Yea, season 2 ended in 2012."
Victorious,That’s pretty good for the middle of a workday!
Victorious,"We had a departmental meeting that morning, which ended with some executive telling us: Don't forget to watch USA-Iran this afternoon! Pretty neat!"
Victorious,Still has room to grow. Span-Germany had over 11 million viewers in Spain. Over 1 in 5 people in the country watched it.
Victorious,I had it on my phone on my desk while I worked. And I don't even like soccer that much.
Victorious,Better than the World Series
Victorious,[removed]
Victorious,[deleted]
Victorious,I don’t know how it’s counted but the number may be higher considering the number of watch parties.
Victorious,"I don’t even like soccer, but I almost called off work to stay home and watch it."
Victorious,It’s honestly the main reason I watched it. Had it on as i worked from home.
Victorious,"Just to throw a grenade of chaos into the topic, way less than the Oscars (16m) though!"
Victorious,"World Series: every year only two cities have teams in it

World Cup: every four years only whole country is involved"

Victorious,well all the Iranians I know were rooting for America funny how that works
Victorious,lulz ok bozo
Victorious,"that's so lame, and that's coming from someone who usually ""hates"" America"
Victorious,"I believe you that some americans cheered for Iran , I dont know why your gettin downvoted"
Victorious,Had between 50 and 100 on 1 tv at my work throughout the day
Victorious,Let alone people like me who taped it on an app.
Victorious,"Nielsen says they take those sort of events into account, assuming they have a true representative sample of television audiences, that would include watch parties and businesses showing the game like bars and restaurants. 

However their methodology is under a lot of scrutiny as of late. I would take all of their data with a grain of salt. The value you can always still pull from it is proportional. If 12m people reportedly watched the world cup, and 6m people reportedly watched the last NFL game, even if those numbers are incorrect, you could still accurately say twice as many people watched the World Cup."
Victorious,"I don’t even like soccer, so I never watched it"
Victorious,That fall from grace though.
Victorious,I doubt people are having watch parties at the same scale for the Oscars though
Victorious,And the Oscar's pale in comparison to the Cowboys (NFL) game on Thanksgiving 42M!
Victorious,"Thirty years ago, the idea of any soccer game viewing higher than the world series would be unthinkable. The fact that you need to qualify the numbers says everything."
Victorious,lol these are facts and still downvoted
Victorious,[deleted]
Victorious,Still surprisingly high for how people think about it online though. You’d think it’d be like low single digit millions but it pulls ballpark Sunday Night Football ratings.
Victorious,People watch it at bars though.
Victorious,"It's been this way for a while the 1994 Final had 18.1 million, 1999 Women's Final had 18.0 million"
Victorious,? They advanced to 16
Victorious,"Article that ratings are down in Germany: 15k upvotes!

Victorious,"> The 18.7M figure includes TV, iPlayer and BBC Sport Online viewing.

> The BBC has seen a big spike in iPlayer viewing during the World Cup, with BBC programs streamed a record 165M last week, up 20% week-on-week and breaking the previous high by 12M.

I watched the US Iran game and naturally they kept posting the English Scores."

Victorious,"A huge flaw in reddit's up/downvote system: People just downvote unpleasant truths and upvote whatever sounds good, regardless of reality."
Victorious,Please link the /r/television post about Germany ratings being down that got 15k upvotes.
Victorious,Huh? There were two topics on the low German World Cup ratings on r/television and both of them got less than 100 upvotes.
Victorious,Why do you care?
Victorious,"The atmosphere for Iran USA was electric in the first half. I flicked over to the other match from time to time and it seemed very drab in comparison. It's a pity Wales go home now though, it was great to have them in the tournament."
Victorious,">	I watched the US Iran game and naturally they kept posting the English Scores.

I mean I watched the England vs Wales game and they did the same thing - kept posting the USA vs Iran scores. It was helpful as you could see who was likely qualifying from the group."
Victorious,"The USA vs Iran game was played at the same time.

EDIT: also literally the first sentence says UK viewers LOL"
Victorious,The US has a much bigger population that the UK. 18.7 million viewers in the UK is the same as 92 million in the US.
Victorious,"Worldwide every single world cup game usually beats the Superbowl. It's a month of back to back superbowls. 

Also I don't particularly trust the numbers for sports many people watch in groups in pubs, clubs or just by having friends over and tv ratings is just guesswork really"
Victorious,"The US lost its main striker during its score and the US just packed it in on Defense for the second. It was a stressful 54 minutes. 

How they handling stoppage time is great. It does make for long halves though."
Victorious,yeah
Victorious,Damn that's ~26% of the UK's population!
Victorious,"Absolutely fantastic numbers. Beyond the obvious benefits the win brings to grassroots football in the UK, it also highlights how important it is to have football free and accessible for everyone. 

As of right now in the UK the Premier League games are split between Sky, BT and Amazon Prime, all services you have to pay for. I think if someone were to subscribe to all three you're looking at £100-150 a month minimum. This isn't for all the games either, as every 3pm fixture is blocked off meaning you're paying a premium to not even get access to every possible game. 

When I went to the US to visit family I couldn't believe that NBC Sport had access to every league game live and on demand. I was so fucking jealous. Why does the US get better coverage of our main league for a fraction of the price? It's so frustrating.

Hopefully we can move on from this archaic era of football in the UK (I respect the 3pm blackout though and see why it should stay) and have everything on an accessible streaming service for a reasonable price. I wish BBC and ITV could get the rights to more league games and the Women's Super League too."
Victorious,Hearing the hype second hand made me hyped and excited as a yank
Victorious,"We watched it yesterday (in US). Had to explain to my daughter how momentous and controversial a woman whipping off her own jersey was on TV back when Brandi Chastain did it. Saw Chloe Kelly got a yellow card, but nowhere near the drama now, 20+ years later."
Victorious,"wtf. I had zero idea the Women's Euro was even going on! 

Didn't see a single match on American TV, so I guess the USA didn't qualify.  (/s)"
Victorious,"My Brit friend kept telling me how nobody cared about bird football and then ""bird football"" registered 17.6m on the ratings scale, and a girl's soccer club explosion all over England."
Victorious,"The girls played with much more heart than I ever seen the mens team play with. Mens club football is my bread and butter but I definitely near shed a tear watching the women play their hearts out this tournament. Germany were the more experienced and settled side but the women just ran at them with heart. 

I feel that the women put more into their England caps because they don’t have one eye on club football like they men do…"
Victorious,"It's almost like people are engaged in womens sport and want to support and watch these teams succeed....maybe we should put more money into the game....NA  


WORLD CUP IN QUATAR FOOTBALLCOMINGHOME!"
Victorious,"Good job women. 

Good job Bill. 

IYKYK"
Victorious,"No one cares about woman’s football as much as I applaud englands ladies for winning it just won’t matter and that’s just the facts! I’m not looking to put them down in any way for playing the game they love but football is a business at the end of the day and it is all about the money and that all starts with the ticket sales, if there are little to no ticket sales it will not attract investment or major sponsorships or attract tv airtime let alone prime tv slots that the mens game is used to, the womens game just doesn’t generate the revenue to keep it sustainable for all the extra costs to take it to the next level and I’m getting tired of all these women especially the feminists who continually look to blame men for the failure of woman’s football on a whole! Why are the stands not packed out with women wanting to support their fellow women they “care so much about” why are the women not buying season tickets to their local or favourite clubs to show support or to buy the shirts or other merchandise the teams sell? How many women make the trips to shitty towns or cities week in week out in shit weather or in the cold and rain to support the womens teams you all now seem to “care about”? You don’t you would rather watch reality show bullshit or soap operas on tele than make the effort! You have had 50years to generate interest in the game but yet there is always some excuse as to why it’s not your fault and why the blame always ends up with males and it’s getting very boring to keep hearing! Women do not support women in general that is a fact and when they do on the odd occasions it usually comes with some form of Benefit for them individually or at the cost of belittling men! I am proud of the English woman’s national team for winning they showed courage and true team mentality but it is a shame the reality is that in a week or two this will be forgotten and the womens game will once again be unnoticed and that is not the fault of men that is the fault of women who like to talk about caring but when it actually comes to it don’t care one bit just when it suits them!"
Victorious,17.6 million BBCs watched womens soccer? Sheeesh look out
Victorious,It is amazing how much European women’s football has improved in the last decade.  I also watch some games in the South American tournament and their game has stood still while the skills in Europe have massively improved.  The USA might get their ass kicked badly in next year’s World Cup.
Victorious,The men's final last year peaked at over 30 million + they can't really count viewing in pubs numbers. Basically football is by far the biggest thing here.
Victorious,"I’m actually surprised the number is that low, the way football is a religion in the UK I would have thought it would be closer to 25-27mil"
Victorious,And then they all turned over once the commonwealth games came on because no one gives a fuck about an international sports week  that costs £778 million when we have an unprecedented rising cost’s crisis.
Victorious,that 26 percent of the population that fell asleep
Victorious,In lockdown one the bbc had some premier league games as fans were shut out. Think the biggest numbers were about 6million?
Victorious,The rights to the Premier League were originally split between multiple services because Sky having full rights was considered a monopoly under EU law. This won't change post Brexit because there are now more games televised and the cost of the rights has increased so Sky can no longer afford to purchase them all.
Victorious,Your pricing is a tiny bit off only like £10-£15 minimum. Source: upgraded today and also pay for prime.
Victorious,"They don't have access to every game, it's around 5 games, some are on USA, and others are streamed on the peacock app."
Victorious,May as well spend that £100 in the pub!
Victorious,The yellow card is the rule for both womens and mens football
Victorious,"> Saw Chloe Kelly got a yellow card

this has been a rule for a long time now. Almost 20 years."
Victorious,"> so I guess the USA didn't qualify.

For a moment there, that genuinely surprised me. And then my second brain-cell kicked in."
Victorious,"ESPN/ESPN2 broadcast plenty of matches, and they also put the semis and final on ESPN+"
Victorious,I watched a ton of games on US tv. Most of them were very exciting.
Victorious,"But will it last ?  
They tried the same during last women world cup in france: the day france was eliminated, it was over, no one talked about it anymore."
Victorious,[deleted]
Victorious,"They only became engaged once the Lionesses started winning in the tournament, and because it's a major tournament. I remember asking a pub owner if he'd be showing the game that night for their second or third game of the tournament, and he didn't even know it was happening.

We'll see how engaged people stay once the players go back to their regular leagues."
Victorious,"Mens teams already subsidise womens teams in England who can’t operate on their own… 

If the sport wants to grow they need to start attracting crowds.

Everybody got behind this because they wanted to see England win a trophy, but it means nothing if the crowds don’t then turn up to games every weekend. 

And attendance thus far is saying they don’t.

But hopefully after this success they are able to pull in bigger crowds.. 

at least in the UK thing that’s getting lost in all the news is pushing the idea that the Lionesses have “changed the world of football” 

How? Nobody in the rest of Europe cares that England won… it’s maybe changed things in England but that’s it."
Victorious,Nice pasta
Victorious,"Yeah international football seems to get everyone watching, my sister and mum who don’t have any interest in football were watching random games between countries because its on FTA"
Victorious,"There's still a lot of people here who, wrongly, believe that womens football ""isn't real football""."
Victorious,Also it was England playing and they are the largest country in the UK but the majority of people from the other countries wouldn’t be watching England play
Victorious,"It’s worth remembering that it was England playing, not Britain as a whole. Definitely wouldn’t assume that all football fans in Wales and Scotland would’ve been watching or cheering us on!

We’ve also got the Commonwealth games on here at the same time and there’s extensive fta coverage of it on the BBC too."
Victorious,"it was 23m including streams, even higher if you include public screenings

17.6m was just the number who watched it at home on tv"
Victorious,truth
Victorious,"> Think the biggest numbers were about 6million?

Not bad numbers at all, but to be fair the games that BBC got coverage for were absolutely wank. I remember after the initial delight of finally having local coverage people would go ""of course BBC get the shit ones"". All the big games (and thus, larger viewership) were kept for the likes of Sky and BT which was frustrating but not unexpected."
Victorious,"It did used to be all available via NBCSN and on their streaming site. Now it's more spread out, and very annoying."
Victorious,it's already sparked massive interest in women's football at the club and girl's level
Victorious,https://www.espn.com/soccer/uefa-womens-european-championship/story/4710636/englands-historic-euro-2022-victory-has-changed-the-face-of-womens-footballand-this-is-only-the-start
Victorious,"We both know it takes much more than the fielded teams to win a final. It’s true that the German side (team, back room staff, senior players) had reached more final success than England have. 

That’s not to take away from the English womens team but it’s just a fact, I see your point about the fielded team though. 

I was also making reference to their style of play, I could see similarities in the style of play of the German men and women that settled relax style of play, it’s tough to play against but England broke it down with press and heart"
Victorious,"Gonna be interesting to check the numbers for the WC in Qatar.

Even though I casually enjoy the big competitions like that, I sure as fuck plan to not watch a single match of that horror.

Even if France makes it to the final. :)"
Victorious,I watch lots of football I like having a break from it. I would be faking it if I said I enjoy it as much as the men's game whilst still believing they should be treated fairly and given every chance. I caught the second half and Extra time but I can't say I am as emotionally invested.
Victorious,[removed]
Victorious,what do you mean with not real football? sure the skill level is lot lower but sure looks like real football to me.
Victorious,"The Super Bowl get 3 to 4 times the number of viewers as the College Football Championship Game, and if the talent gap between Alabama and KC is lets say 80-to-100, than the talent gap between England Women and England Men is 5-to-100."
Victorious,"Meh. The difference is staggering. Top level, professional Women's football is like a mens league 1 reserve team.

Also, it always comes across like men are the bad guys here for not watching. Whys it mens job to watch Women's sport? You go girls. Get it done. Put your money where your mouth is."
Victorious,"The way you worded that it sounds like England is only a slight majority.

England on its own has a population of 56mil, the UK has a population of 67mil."
Victorious,"I'm a Brentford fan so I was like, I wish it was that easy."
Victorious,"Difficult to be as invested when you've likely spent a tiny fraction of your time watching women's football as opposed to men's.

I think as time goes on women's football will be able to catch up in viewership and with that will come investment not only from fans but big companies who see profit in it."
Victorious,Aren't there like 8 leagues of lower than Premier League standard football in the UK alone? How many viewers do you think actually give a shit about tactical midfield play or whatever compared to exciting goals and highlights?
Victorious,"It absolutely is real football. But there are some people (Mostly older) that don't see it as ""real"" football, because it's played by women and not men."
Vikings,"I wish they would like, do Viking raids and Viking shit in this show. Just a ridiculous soap opera at this point"
Vikings,Vinland Saga > Vikings: Valhalla
Vikings,"If Netflix is to be believed, you get to have more seasons if you cost little to make.  So maybe this show has a very low budget.  Certainly is written that way."
Vikings,Sad the last kingdom is ending because that is a way better Viking show than this. I’ll always be thankful that Netflix picked that show up and gave it 3 more quality seasons and a movie. This show just isn’t good enough to fill the void that’ll be there with no more the last kingdom.
Vikings,"How the fuck this show is getting 3 seasons is beyond me, truly lol."
Vikings,"At this point it seems like there's no rhyme or reason to Netflix's renewal choices. But it appears in this case, seasons 2 and 3 were both green lit after the success of season 1. Season 2 posted abysmal numbers in comparison.

Season 1 of Valhalla was actually pretty good, but season 2 was wrought with terrible writing, a rushed ending, shaky chemistry and entire episodes of boring melodrama and zero action. I fear season 3 will continue with this trend.

Scrap it and bring back 1899."
Vikings,As long as Netflix doesn't sink by then from punching too many holes in their own boat.
Vikings,Still a very enjoyable show. I'm glad it's getting another season. Don't believe all the haters in this thread.
Vikings,Cool. The first season was pretty rough but the second was better. Im looking forward to it.
Vikings,Lmao I stopped after seeing Jarl Haakon. It's just ridiculous and out of place.
Vikings,"Thought the season would actually be interesting with Harald joining the Varangian guard (as he did historically) and seeing Constantinople. But nope, we got like 3 episodes of them just sitting next to a river. Maybe next season I guess, but doubt since they're going for 8 episode seasons another disappointment compared to the first three seasons of the original series. 


Then there is an entire super special Freydis arc, which is practically a rehash of season 1 along with the poorly written cartoon villain wanting to murder her for questionable reasons."
Vikings,"usually I hate unecessary comparisons like this, but yea Vinland Saga is in a whole 'nother realm. Vikings Valhalla is struggling to be a competent TV show, while each episode of Vinland Saga is a literal gift."
Vikings,"Recommend checking The Northman, if you haven't already."
Vikings,Contract obligation when Netflix picked up the show. Otherwise I doubt we’d be getting a 3rd season.
Vikings,"FYI, this was greenlit for 3 seasons up front. S2 did not do well on the ratings chart so S3 will likely be the last."
Vikings,For one thing this show could be cheaper to make them 1899 so they are fine with the numbers and nobody watched it finished 1899 only stupid business people would keep that going
Vikings,"I want to say that it's because of they were obligated by the contract to make 3 seasons. Vikings was already pretty damn popular on their platform and when this show was set forth for them to sign on, the creators probably made Netflix sign on for 3 seasons. 

But with 1899 it was just more of Dark was successful (definitely way more later, but might have been good back then as well for what kinda numbers Netflix were pulling back then), but those numbers compared to what Netflix pulls now with their absolute dogshit content, they probably thought 1899 wasn't worth it. And also it seems that most people didn't even continue after episode 3 so, there was logistically no reason for them to continue the show. 

Here's hoping that HBO or FX will pick it up for a second season."
Vikings,Yea it is fun.  In my mind it is somewhat better than late season Vikings but not as good as early season Vikings.  Well worth watching though.
Vikings,"I’d argue it’s much worse, couldn’t even finish it."
Vikings,"Sounds expensive, but I would love to see a series do justice to the Varangian guard at its height."
Vikings,"I have, dope movie. Bummer it was a bomb at the box office"
Vikings,"Yeah this is right where I'd put it.  Nowhere near as good as Travis Fimmel seasons, better than post-Fimmel Vikings."
Vikings,Really? I had a hard time finishing the first and only being sick at the time made finish but I really enjoyed the second.
Vikings,"I wish I could muster something more than a non-commital ""meh"" to this. Early seasons of og Vikings were just way more engaging. This mostly came down to the performances. You couldn't take your eyes off Travis Fimmel, but supports like Katheryn Winnick and Gustaf Skarsgard were no slouches, either. I barely remember anything about the characters in Valhalla. Someone as interesting as Leif Erikkson should have been a massive draw, instead he felt like just some dude. 

Valhalla felt like an expensive attempt to cash in on the original Vikings, even after the later seasons of that show proved the concept had more than run its course."
Vikings,"Nice to see this season arrive in such a timely fashion. Only 11 months after the first season. Not having to wait 18-30 months between seasons is definitely something streaming and premium cable should be looking to address. 

Looking forward to this one. I know it had its critics but I ended up loving the first season!"
Vikings,I found season 1 to be utter ass. I have lost all excitement for anything Viking related since Fimmel left the History series tbh
Vikings,"YES!!! Excellent cast, great script and pacing! Season 2 starts at 3AM ET! Enjoy!"
Vikings,WoW. Time flies quick. Feels like I was just watching the show last month when I was sick at home early this year.
Vikings,"I watched the 1st season and it was.... Okay. Not bad but not great. If there is one character I truly like, it's Cnut. But there is one thing that's perplexing to me,  the reason for the casting of Jarl Hakkon. They could have recast any other character and it would still be fine but nope. They just had to recast a historically important character."
Vikings,Is this the show where Jarl Haakon (a real historical figure) is confoundingly played by a black woman?
Vikings,"Season 1 wasn't groundbreaking but content is content, love me some historical shiiiii"
Vikings,"I saw this on Nflix and didn't watch bc I was only one season into the original Vikings show, do they have any crossover or are the two shows related in any way?"
Vikings,"this the one with the Jarl flipped into a black woman? lmao, next level idiocy"
Vikings,"It's pretty funny how the only thing some people bring up is Jarl Hakkon. Personally think it's stupid they even made that casting choice myself too. But I also doubt any of these people even watched the show itself, probably just regurgitating BS they heard from their chud right grifter channels."
Vikings,There was a season 1?
Vikings,I can't remember if I watched this.
Vikings,Pretty much exactly as you said. Those stellar performances elevated what otherwise would have been some pretty basic television.
Vikings,I am so sad that this is so true.
Vikings,"Didn't they start shooting it before s1 premiered? Also the show got 3 seasons order from the get go, that helps moving things faster forward."
Vikings,Yea I enjoyed the first season.  It was not quite as good as early seasons Vikings but it was much better than late seasons Vikings.  If you like Vikings or The Last Kingdom then it is well worth watching.
Vikings,The first season was only 7-8 episodes. I'm assuming the second season is gonna be likewise.
Vikings,AMEN! So tired of the critics! It's 100 years later!!
Vikings,huh?
Vikings,It’s a completely different character.
Vikings,"The jarl is only inspired by the real one, she's not meant to actually be him. And there's a lot in both vikings and vikings valhalla that's just straight up false, it might as well be considered fantasy, so I dont understand why this one character is making yall so upset."
Vikings,Vikings valhalla takes place after the original show but it is a fresh new storyline and not a sequel so you can watch in whatever order u want.
Vikings,"Bizarrely, the kids of a character who shows up towards the end of OG Vikings are in Valhalla...which is set 100 years later."
Vikings,It is funny to see that incels are still crying about it.
Vikings,"because it sticks out, like making a serie about Nobunaga and casting a ginger Irish teenager as the shogun Tokugawa. Like casting that American dumbface as Goku in that dreadful Dragon Ball movie. It's so immeasurably idiotic it steamrolls every other aspect, good or bad"
Vikings,"No, they just decided to make a second season before making the first one"
Vikings,I can’t remember if I finished the first Vikings series :(
Vikings,"I wish more shows committed to filming multiple seasons at once/close together. Slow Horses films two seasons as a time, so season 1 released in March, 2 releases in December and they are filming 3 and 4 right now."
Vikings,[deleted]
Vikings,"you people keep regurgitating the same stupid excuse, but I'll bet if the opposite happened you'd all be flooding twitter tearing your hair out in front of such a mind boggling affront because your indignation is coated in hypocrisy"
Vikings,"It doesn't. Just that it's a historically important character. Also, her ultimate fate sucked. The least they could have done is fleshed her out a bit more"
Vikings,"Come on, you KNOW why, really."
Vikings,"Incel doesn't mean 'person I disagree with'.

edit: lol, he blocked me"
Vikings,"Yeah, dissenters to this opinion will cry bigotry when in fact, it’s so perplexing a choice as to actually pull me out of the show and totally break my immersion. I need to be immersed when I’m watching a Viking show."
Vikings,"probably not, one of the best endings ive seen, you'd remember it"
Vikings,"wait seriously? 

Like making a Zulu chief a Korean.  Its beyond dumb"
Vikings,"Ah, that one"
Vikings,"The vikings were involved in trade in the middle east, this is historically accurste and there were black people brought back to europe. 

Her grandfather met her grandmother in Egypt  where they fell in love and he brought her back to Denmark (I think it's denmark). There only like 2 black people in the entire show, it's not like it's far fetched."
Vikings,"> the same stupid excuse

You mean the truth??? From episode one of Vikings it was never historically accurate, They made Ragnar and Rollo brothers when they weren't even alive at the same time, and they killed siguard snake in the eye when he was supposed to go on and do some important historical shit. None of yall gave a shit about any of that but as soon as theres a half black Jarl suddenly its a fucking problem?? Its not a fucking documentary, get over it."
Vikings,"Yep, I just want them to admit it instead of beating around the bush"
Vikings,[deleted]
Vikings,There might not have been one in real life but none of the show is historically accurate
Vikings,Doesn't matter it's just so out of place it's actually retarded
Vikings,"It was more watched than 1899 but not by a ton. If we go with the equivalent complete viewings metric 1899 did 32.8 million over its first 4 weeks while Vikings: Valhalla did 37.7 million over the same period. 

Netflix had to order three seasons of Vikings: Valhalla upfront to win the rights to the IP so I’m guessing it will go exactly 3 seasons."
Vikings,"Vikings: Valhalla was being shopped to multiple different locations and one of the conditions of it getting sold was that whoever purchased it had to agree to three seasons from the get go. So Vikings could be seen as renewed, or more accurately it could be seen as having been greenlit for a 3-part 24 episode season at its advent."
Vikings,"Valhalla fills the void left by the end of Vikings and Last Kingdom. 

It's not nearly as good as those two, but it was still watchable."
Vikings,"1899 was very slow to start, but damn it got so good. I'm really bummed they canceled it."
Vikings,"1899: about 239 million hours over 4 weeks that work out at about 32 millions complete viewings. Furthermore, we know it had an abysmal [32% completion rate](https://www.whats-on-netflix.com/news/netflix-top-10-report-1899-cancelation-plus-treason-and-white-noise-debuts/) that worked against it. Budget was 60 millions.

Vikings Valhalla: about 256 million hours over 28 days that work out at 37 million complete viewings. No data about completion rate but it must have been decent enough if Netflix renewed for 2 more seasons all at once."
Vikings,"I loved The Last Kingdom, so after I tried Vikings multiple times but it just didn't resonate with me for some reason. Does it get better after S1?"
Vikings,"Leaving aside the next season of Vikings already being in the can, it's also much easier to leave on as a casual show while doing other stuff, which probably bumps completion rates"
Vikings,"I don't even knownwhat vikings valhalla even is, I watched 2 episodes of 1899 and feel Ike I did not get far enough in to want to continue if they don't want to continue.  I suppose I will check out the one that is continuing on.

Edit:  just looked it up...I'm not sure how I missed that one, I like content along those lines."
Vikings,Vikings Valhalla was bigger internationally but smaller in the US. I would guess VV was barely renewed. It looks like they are releasing a mobile game for it which may have affected things.
Vikings,"I didn't watch 1899, but vikings vahalla wasn't even remotely watchable in my view.  The shows was just full of bad writing.  It was mind boggling to me that the show has any following at all."
Vikings,"1899 had more reviews (80k v 42k reviews on imdb), was higher rated (7.4 v 7.2), had nearly the same viewing hours (239m v 256m), had similar completion numbers (32m v 37m), 1899 was a bit more expensive (55m v 50m).

Not really sure why vikings valhala was seen as renewable and 1899 wasnt based on this data.

Also 1899 has showrunners Netflix has worked with before that made a complete series that is highly rated.  They have a diverse cast with multiple languages and world wide audience reach"
Vikings,I think that's what you have to do as a tv runner. Highest streaming wins plus at least 3 seasons. No more 1 season cancelations.
Vikings,"Another comment said that Netflix contractually agreed to 3 seasons upfront when they acquired the property, so in that case the completion rate didn’t need to be that great."
Vikings,"We do not actually know completion ratios. That stat for 1899 was third party data with none of it sourced from the US. Interesting, for sure, but a tad irrelevant when we have no other data points for comparison. 

Vikings: Valhalla is safe regardless. Netflix had to commit to 24 episodes from the get go in order to win the IP rights in a competitive bidding situation. A tad like the deal Amazon had to sign to win Rings of Power from rival bidders. With viewership what it is and the heavy drop in the third and fourth weeks I’m betting we will get exactly 24 episodes (3 seasons) and no more of Vikings: Valhalla."
Vikings,The original Vikings was very up and down and then fell off a cliff once Travis Fimmel left. I thought the writing for Valhalla was a lot tighter.
Vikings,Agree as a big last kingdom fan you will like vikings Valhalla
Vikings,"It's just Lost again. It ends on opening a mystery box and inside is another mystery box. It escalates much faster than Lost in the first season and I'm not entirely convinced this whole thing isn't some viral marketing 

>!The final episode turns out it's not 1899, it's 2099 so Netflix could announce a new show 2099 coming next year making the entire cancellation just marketing.!<"
Vikings,"If you like the genre, I'd give it a chance. 

If you haven't seen The Last Kingdom, I highly recommend you start there. It's probably the best ""Viking"" show period, and on par with Black Sails and early seasons of GoT."
Vikings,"> Not really sure why vikings valhala was seen as renewable and 1899 wasnt based on this data.

*Vikings: Valhalla* got a 24-episode order from the start.

> At the time, History was in talks with MGM TV about the offshoot. But interest in the project quickly grew as streamers with deep pockets went after the hot, global-appeal property. By this fall, Vikings: Valhalla was in a bidding situation with three major streaming companies in pursuit. Netflix landed the series in a pricey deal with a massive commitment, by its standards, of 24 episodes

Vikings,It makes sense. 37 millions with that budget is probably not high enough for a long run.
Vikings,Well I’m not watching 2099 since it’s going to get cancelled
Vikings,And they can also announce a prequel called 1799.
Vikings,"Interesting, like it's some marketing/PR scheme cooked up by some evil genius at Netflix. Or a kind of April Fool's joke in January. Well, we'll see and perhaps Netflix will come out with some announcement about their upcoming series '2099'."
Vikings,"Last Kingdom was OK, but hearing the ""I am Utred (sp) son of Utred""
line gets pretty tiresome."
Vikings,"Ya I watched last kingdom and really enjoyed it last kingdom and black sails, I only read GOT...still waiting for that next book. :-("
Vikings,Yeah but then you’ll miss out on the next season which is >!3099!<. Everything will pay off if you just hang in there until then!
Vikings,"Pure copium, of course, but it would be a ballsy move."
Vikings,Arseling
Vikings,His accent is terrible but great at the same time for some reason.
Vikings,It’s made by the same ppl as dark who did end up tying up the mystery box pretty well. I trust them to not do the same shit as lost. I’m sure they had an ending in mind already
Vikings,"Great series, but he was the least likeable character IMO"
Vikings,Brida is easily the least likable character. Not even close.
Vikings,"Yea, agreed, on that 1 to 10 scale"
Teletubbies,"My Brummy mate the comedian John Simmit was a teletubby, but I had moved to Ireland before my first child was born, so sat through a good few hours of these without knowing he was in the costume. I doubt he is in this series. Sadly one of the other originals passed away."
Teletubbies,"Weird hearing this with an American accent. Did the original Teletubbies have an American voiceover when aired in the US?

Teletubbies was/is always pronounced telly-tubbies on UK television, but not this time I guess."
Teletubbies,Can't believe they would take a documentary about what it's like to live in the British countryside and needlessly Americanise it
Teletubbies,This is the darkest timeline
Teletubbies,LETS FUCKING GOOOO
Teletubbies,The voice over was British in the US but definitely pronounced the word same as it is in this trailer
Teletubbies,Why?
Teletubbies,"The 4 horsemen cometh, and hell followed..."
Teletubbies,"Apparently, televangelists claimed Tinky-Winky promoted homosexuality. Never saw that connection, but there was unwarranted controversy surrounding Teletubbies in early 1990's."
Teletubbies,Have you ever seen the [Boohbahs?](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=JTE1hIluGEY)
Teletubbies,the baby in the sun freaked me out all the time. I had to do it twice. my kids are 10 years apart... ugh the baby burns my eyes!!!!!!
Teletubbies,Ragdoll made some of the weirdest children's shows
Teletubbies,I'm a grown man and felt the same when I watched Pee-wee's Playhouse for the first time in 25+ years. That show is total nightmare fuel.
Teletubbies,Po's karate always got me rolling.
Teletubbies,"I think it was Falwell who said something like, ""His colour is purple: THE GAY PRIDE COLOUR! His symbol is a triangle: THE GAY PRIDE SYMBOL!""

And he had a handbag."
Teletubbies,Teletubbies didn't start until the late 90s
Teletubbies,Yeah that show was weird too
Teletubbies,When did adults being weird about things made for kids start being a thing
Teletubbies,"A better read:

https://everything2.com/title/Teletubbies%252C+the+State%252C+and+Social+Mechanization"
Teletubbies,"Honestly, the only thing that I know about them is that Jerry Falwell was pissed off at the purple one because somewhere in the twit resources of his redundant mind he decided that the purple one was gay.  Other than that, they are an enigma and a mystery."
Teletubbies,Since the magic roundabout. So at least 50 years.
Teletubbies,That was a fucking awesome read. Thanks!
Teletubbies,I guess if any of them were gay Tinky Winky is a fair choice
Teletubbies,"Caillou's constant unending whining about everything. At thats what I remember from when my nephew was watching it over the holidays. I couldn't even ve in the same room, lol."
Teletubbies,"Unpopular opinion.  That show was designed to be relatable to 3/4 year olds.  He gets upset about something, then works it through to some conclusion.  I liked watching it with my daughter when she was small."
Teletubbies,He's a whiny little shit! That's why. It was banned in our house.
Teletubbies,Caillou was annoying
Teletubbies,"It's the whining. 

Plenty of shows have characters with annoying voices, take for example, Maggie and the Ferocious Beast, but Caillou takes it to a whole new level."
Teletubbies,The fact that it encourages children to throw tantrums to get what they want.
Teletubbies,His little bitch dad can fuck right off also
Teletubbies,His bald head
Teletubbies,"It’s in no way worse than Barney and Teletubbies.

My issue with it was that it was on the boring side but not to my kid."
Teletubbies,He's bald
Teletubbies,everything but Teletubbies was much worse.. that baby in the sun freaks me out still to this day seeing him
Teletubbies,"Balamory was way worse, that thing creeped the hell out of me, and I was 22 at the time"
Teletubbies,Can't be more annoying than bing!
Teletubbies,He's the prototype One Punch Man
Teletubbies,No one talks about this but his bald head really is terrible
Teletubbies,">Decades after gay rumors rocked Tinky Winky — the purple one with the triangle antenna — the beloved kids' TV characters have released their first line of Pride merchandise.

I forgot about that whole thing.

People who weren't there wouldn't believe how big the ""is Tinky Winky gay?"" thing was. It was everywhere, people really needed to know if this little weirdo had sex other little weirdos of the same gender.

I wish I were kidding."
Teletubbies,"I ain't believing nothing  til Tinky does a sit down interview with Robin, Don or Gale. And explains what made him take this step."
Teletubbies,"And the ""evidence"" was that he had a purse"
Teletubbies,I thought it was a girl.
Teletubbies,"If I'm remembering right (and who knows, I was 8) that's actually what started it. People assumed the purple one was a girl for having a purse and when the creators were like ""nope, thats a guy"" everyone decided he must be gay"
Teletubbies,RIP Tinky Winky
Teletubbies,"The sun is setting in the sky.
Teletubbies say good-bye."
Teletubbies,Noooooooooooooooo!
Teletubbies,time for Teletubby bye bye

Teletubbies,Damn this thread is low key dark
Teletubbies,"Star is the word that should be in single quotes. 

Also, single quotes look like this ' 

Use the right quotes. Thanks."
Teletubbies,"Tinky Winky's character development in the latest series is of notably poorer quality than previous installments, with the finale in particular divisive among the fandom due to abandonment of an ongoing arc between Tinky Winky and Dipsy (I won't spoil for those who haven't seen yet, as it's still an enjoyable episode).

Hopefully Shelton's replacement will help in breathing new life to the character and reinvigorating the franchise; I personally hope they're eyeing up Charles Dance or Peter Capaldi for the role."
Teletubbies,fuck that made me sad
Teletubbies,"Sorry for this but how did his heart stop?

Heart attack?
Blood clot?
"
Teletubbies,"Simon's heart stopped, for one."
Teletubbies,[deleted]
Teletubbies,Who is quoting? And who is quoting that quote? Use the right quotes? How about you learn when to use the marks first.
Teletubbies,why the downvotes? You're absolutely correct... I really don't get reddit sometimes
Teletubbies,Froze to death. 
Teletubbies,"Because these ' ""

Pretty straight forward."
Teletubbies,"Stop. You don't seem to understand anything. It was facetious.
 
The marks are never appropriate, you use single quotes or italic for that."
Teletubbies,No they aren't. No one is quoting anything. There should be no marks.
Teletubbies,"Oh, that's not the downvote counter, it's the idiot counter. It's better they stick to clicking rather than post anyway.

I prefer a high idiot counter, because it brings to light how many idiots are browsing this board.

Especially when the comprehension failure is because of something like 8th grade English, or wit. Ignorance is bliss."
Teletubbies,"I appreciate this post. 

Sometimes I wonder myself. 

They don't seem to get anything."
Teletubbies,Teletubbies is the name of the show and therefor should be in quotes. Star should be in single quotes because Simon Shelton was not literally a ball of gas. Middle school ELA wants a word with you.
Teletubbies,How high are you?
Teletubbies,"What makes Noo-Noo so special is that he's _always_ been there for the other Teletubbies, even when they don't deserve it. Tinky-Winky does his best to hold the crew together, but there's little doubt in my mind that Dipsy would've left to pursue his career in hatmaking were it not for Noo-Noo's continued support. And how many times has Noo-Noo been a shoulder for Po to cry on when La-La's being a bitch to her?

I mean, just watch [this classic musical number](https://youtu.be/W7NPMYrngqg?t=410). How many fictional characters do you know capable of defusing such a vehement dispute between four friends? Noo-Noo just sees through all the bullshit and sucks up the source of their anguish without a second thought. Some of Noo-Noo's fans thought this was a moment of defeat - a sign that Noo-Noo had finally cracked under the weight of La-La's self-pity, and that he only cleaned the seat to get her to shut up. I don't think that's fair though. After all, it's not like La-La was the only one making a fuss. The fascinating thing about the segment is that _all_ the Teletubbies spend time without a seat - it just so happens to be La-La who finally recognizes the inevitable failure of trying to squeeze four Teletubbies onto three clean seats. Anyway, we all know what La-La's been through. It's not her fault she's so pessimistic.

Also, can we have a moment of appreciation for Noo-Noo's character design? It's been well-documented that the colour blue evokes feelings of calmness, which makes it ideal for a character who always has his friends' best interests at heart. His nose is also a work of genius; I watched a behind-the-scenes interview with the production designer who said that the budget wasn't big enough to give Noo-Noo two separate arms, but since it would look fucking stupid to only give him one, they just removed his arms altogether and gave him a trunk instead. This is reminiscent of the _Loxodonta africana_, or _elephant_, a beloved animal all the world over.

And let's not forget the man behind the magic: Mark Dean! Sometimes it's easy to forget that there's an actual person inside the Noo-Noo, but Dean really brings the character together. Without him, you've just got a blue box on wheels with a vacuum cleaner taped onto the front; his subtle expressions and flawless comic timing are irreplaceable.

I honestly don't think there's been such a well-realized robot character since R2-D2 in the original Star Wars. Noo-Noo has captured the hearts and minds of millions of children all around the world and I'm confident he'll remain the most popular Teletubbies character for years to come."

Teen Wolf,"There was something special about the first season of Teen Wolf.

Somehow a Twilight ripoff made by the channel known for producing such classics as *Jersey Shore* and *Teen Mom*, actually turned out to be a really solid TV show. It's funny. It's spooky. I re-watched it during quarantine and it's just as delightful as it was when I was a kid.

The other seasons were some YA nonsense though, so not getting my hopes up for the movie"
Teen Wolf,Man looks like he's cosplaying a Gilded Age dandy.
Teen Wolf,"Well, that sure is a moustache you end up eating with your food."
Teen Wolf,The fuck is that stache
Teen Wolf,The mustache and outfit say he is not sober
Teen Wolf,i'm personally not a fan of that beard
Teen Wolf,I really have to finish the last season before the movie comes out. Shame Styles won’t be in it but I understand why.
Teen Wolf,"God maybe if  he had been messed up like when he made the tv show the movie might of actually been good.  But honestly idk if that could have helped make this movie good .  Between the acting , the script, and the Mason shooting into the woods at nothing this ended up being a parody of season 3 to me lol."
Teen Wolf,I think the show peaked creatively in season 3 especially the second half of episodes. It never reached those heights again. Then Tyler Hoechlin left after season 4 & Dylan O'Brien was gone for most of the last season. In the end it just kind of petered out.
Teen Wolf,"Yeah the first season was carried I think by simple things: A main character secret that only the audience knows at first, a whodunnit mystery that's tied to that secret, initial wish fulfillment power fantasy with the main character's powers being used to gain advantage in a high school setting, and the camera filter that gave it that constant 'overcast and light drizzle while you wait for the school bus while it's still dark out at 6:30am' vibe that created the mood to complement the setting.

It was just simple and executed competently. The later seasons became as you said, typical YA CW fluff."
Teen Wolf,"Everything from the season one school lockdown to the finale was like uncut 10/10 Buffy level. Ian Bohen was a great and unexpected choice, I dare say he became their Sylar where the writing got a little silly keeping him alive and active, much like Heroes with Teen Wolf my peak was that specific season one arc"
Teen Wolf,It was definitely better than the movie or the first Teen Wolf tv show.
Teen Wolf,That type of mustache is insufferable to live with. I had it like this for about a week before I decided to just give up.
Teen Wolf,"Hot, sexy man stache!"
Teen Wolf,Beard? Looks like a mustache to me and it's hot as hell!
Teen Wolf,Was season 3 the one with those samurai fireflies or something? I liked that one.
Teen Wolf,"I agree. S3, both parts, worked really well. S5 when Dylan was only in it part time worked cos they made his absence part of the mystery. 6 was easily the weakest."
Teen Wolf,"Yeah most people like season 3B, but personally it’s not for me. 

It’s like the writers would forget stuff 5 minutes after it happened, e.g. there's an episode where the sheriff is looking through his old case files for leads on supernatural creatures (literally giant lizard-people and stuff). But later when Stiles tells him there's a were-coyote on the loose, his response is ""that's ridiculous! Things like that don't exist!"" 

???"
Teen Wolf,"Yeah you can tell Teen Wolf never expected to get more than 1 season, based on how  final that ending felt, and how they backpedaled on everything later.

(Spoilers) >!Peter and Kate, brought back to life. Scott and Allison, broken up again. Chris Argent learning the lesson that werewolves aren't all bad people, sudden amnesia.!<"
Teen Wolf,"not a native speaker, isnt a mustache a type of beard?"
Teen Wolf,"That was the first half of Season 6, not Season 5 :)"
Teen Wolf,"rssslll, i agree w/ you 100%.   season 1 was the best!  seasons 1 through season 3A were the best but i too noticed a huge drop on quality with 3B on.    when they killed off >!Allison!< (and eventually  forced the god awful >!Scott/Kira!< romance) i lost a lot of interest/love for the series."
Teen Wolf,My take - things were going pretty well until the production shifted from Atlanta to LA for season three and they started doing the double length season orders to avoid paying raises / streamline the production. They didn’t really have enough plot for 24 episodes a year and that’s when cast members started bailing which impacted the writing
Teen Wolf,No. A mustache is hair right below the nose and above the top lip with no hair anywhere else on the face. A beard is facial hair that covers the entire lower face .
Teen Wolf,"You're right, I keep forgetting they split the seasons."
Teen Wolf,disagree with scott/kira being forced lol but it would’ve been nice to see him single for at least one part of the series (scott/malia was ridiculous).
Teen Wolf,"That's fair. I think what impacted the writing most was having a bunch of random writers who were different every season.

You look at the top shows in this subreddit's sidebar -- Breaking Bad, Avatar, etc. -- and they're all written by 1 group of people from start to finish. Teen Wolf went through 6 different writing teams in 6 seasons."
Teen Wolf,huh TIL! pretty sure its different in my mother tongue
Teen Wolf,You don't have a separate word for the hair just under the nose??? What language do you speak?
Teen Wolf,"Mustache would be Schnurrbart in german, bart means beard. So while it kinda is a term on its own it is also just a subtype of beard"
Teen Wolf,"Interesting. No in most countries I don't think a mustache is ever referred to as a beard. You can have a beard and no mustache, so of course the opposite is true.   


It's like if you cut a branch from a tree and put it in your house, you wouldn't say that it was still a tree...it's just a branch."
Teen Wolf,"I just looked up beard in wikipedia, it defines a beard as facial hair on chin, neck, cheeks, lower or upper lip and lists mustache as a type of beard...are you trolling me, is it your bubble or is wikipedia out of touch??"
Teen Wolf,"Where is the definition your read, you didn't put the link?   


Merriam Webster doesn't define it that way.   


beard  
1 of 2  
noun  
ˈbird   
Synonyms of beard  
1  
: the hair that grows on a man's face often excluding the mustache  
2

Teen Wolf,"In my opinion, I wouldn’t even care to ask for a link since they reference Wikipedia. Lol"
Teen Wolf,"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beard 

its the first sentence but yeah it might admittedly not be the greatest reference. thanks!"
Teen Wolf,"I think it’s the most like Buffy of all the teen-oriented shows. Season 1 is pretty soapy and focuses a lot on cattiness and romance, but it becomes more teamwork and friendship focused after that. It can be a little uneven and silly, but that kinda goes with the territory. I thought it turned out to be a sweet and enjoyable watch."
Teen Wolf,"It’s one of my favorite shows, I’d definitely say it’s worth a watch. I just finished watching it for the 3rd time haha"
Teen Wolf,Watch The Magicians if you want something really similar to Buffy. And The Order as well
Teen Wolf,"It's one of those shows that could. It was cheesy as shit the acting from a few of them mainly the lead wasn't really there but it was great. 

The variety of monsters was different which was exciting.   

When the show was sad it made me sad. The cgi wasn't great but it is MTV so I wasn't complaining. 

All in all if you can handle the cheesiness it's definitely worth it. 'Motel California' is one of the best episodes of TV I've ever seen. 

Aside from Stiles the ladies of the show are the best characters, and I mean every single one of them. Lydia, Malia, Allison.... I would watch it just for them."
Teen Wolf,"Besides Buffy, I think it’s the most worthwhile teen supernatural show (the first three seasons, at least). Solid mythology, endearing characters, and a decent Peter Parker-type story. If you’re in your teens or early 20’s, I’d say it’s worth checking out"
Teen Wolf,"Definitely worth a try and it is much better than you would expect imo.

See also Bitten, The Vampire Diaries, True Blood, Haven."
Teen Wolf,"I liked it. Early seasons, as per usual are best. There's a nice humor to it which always draws me in."
Teen Wolf,"Reading his wiki entry just now was awful. His father killed himself when he was a teen and Colton was told it was because Colton was gay. Then his mother recently died of cirrhosis and he himself was an alcoholic. I feel for him so much, to lose both parents at such a young age to preventable means and the blame to be imposed on him as a teen is just horrendous. I’m glad he found acting."
Teen Wolf,Well Teen Wolf is the one of the biggest Gay Thirst shows ever so that was great casting. It paved the way to others like Elite hehe
Teen Wolf,"This is the third story I've read where nobody at the lower levels of production had a problem with someone's sexuality, it was a bigwig exec. Hollywood needs to clean house already."
Teen Wolf,Then they brought him back in the last season and gave him a boyfriend?
Teen Wolf,Did he know right away when he saw him? That'd be awkward.
Teen Wolf,Colton Haynes has lived a rough life all things considered. I hope he finds his healing.
Teen Wolf,"sounds scummy, but right on track.

anyone remember the stories about the actor playing billy in power rangers?

there wasn't a lot of progressiveness back in the day (and there's still not all that much today)"
Teen Wolf,"I guess since the movie announcement has been circling the news seems like the cast for Teen Wolf are opening up about the issues they came across with this series. I remember Arden Cho, the only Asian cast member, recently disclosed that she passed on an offer to be a part of the revival because she was offered half of the pay that most of the other female cast members were getting."
Teen Wolf,I went to hs with him. Remember all the girls were crazy over him.
Teen Wolf,Was it because it was with another male? or was it because it was kinda explicit?
Teen Wolf,Colton Haynes has a new book out. That’s why we’re suddenly hearing about this YEARS later.
Teen Wolf,"MTV, the company that did true life I’m pregnant with my cousins baby and Jersey Shore. Lel."
Teen Wolf,"I'm all for representation and I've never seen this show, but I'm not sure if it is a good thing that they made his character gay when he came back. 

It seems to reinforce this idea that gay actors can only play gay characters. They did the same thing with Ben Whishaw as Q in Bond. Let gay actors play straight roles and let straight actors play gay roles. It's acting."
Teen Wolf,"So they tried to pull another Art School Girls of Doom…interesting.

On Liquid Television, there were these two cute art school girls that got into mixed media adventures like working a cruddy retail job long enough to buy a fancy bra, a day at the beach, and a night out on the town after having their kitten Morrissey eat their beauty mask yolks.

When it got out that the girls were trans (Gina Varla Vetro and the late Codie Ravioli/Leone), their segment got dropped quicker than most of the other stuff on the show that eventually didn’t make the regular stand alone series cut."
Teen Wolf,Why is no one here talking about the fact that he did a lewd photoshoot as a teenager? How old was he?
Teen Wolf,"Why doesn't the article mention the then-head of MTV's name? Why was there no apparent attempt to contact that person for verification and a quote or two, or to get a response from MTV? Why isn't showrunner Jeff Davis quoted, who, after all, made the allegation?

&#x200B;

 Because it's (formerly Business) Insider, where professional standards don't count, and where laziness rules."
Teen Wolf,"Wait... he posed for a gay men's magazine as a TEENAGER? Does that mean like 18 or 19 I hope? Otherwise isn't that like pedophilia?

Edit: why the hell are you sick fucks downvoting this? Is it ok to sexualize teenagers in your opinion? I know people have done so for ages but that doesn’t make it ok. Girl or boy, gay or straight.

[Turns out he was 17, so he was underaged. Not sure how anyone can justify this. He is posing in a very sexual manner for an adult magazine. It's not porn but clearly the picture was sexual in its intention.](https://gaypagessa.com/2021/06/22/colton-haynes-spent-years-trying-to-remove-this-pic/)

And I'm not saying the actor should've been faulted for it. I'm saying this shouldn't have even been a thing because he was a minor."
Teen Wolf,">The actor mentioned a specific instance in which his manager told him, ""The head of MTV almost didn't hire you because of that XY photo shoot we've been working our asses off to extinguish. Thank God Jeff fought for you to get that role.""

It's worth pointing out that this is like... a third hand, off the cuff remark.  I know people love being outraged, especially over LGBT discrimination, but there's no actual evidence provided that this actually happened or was the reason he *almost* didn't get the role (which he did get, by the way) whatsoever."
Teen Wolf,"That’s messed up but, why is a teen posing for an adult age magazine? hmmmm am I misreading that headline?"
Teen Wolf,"We can tolerate a homosexual Dracula, even a gay Frankenstein (the good Dr didn't make a woman,... ), but 'merica will never accept a gay half-man, half-dog.  It's just not natural."
Teen Wolf,"[Link to the photo and an article](https://gayexpress.co.nz/2021/06/colton-haynes-proudly-shares-photo-that-he-tried-to-erase-from-existence-as-a-closeted-teen/).  Website called Gay Express, fyi.  Apologies if this has already been linked."
Teen Wolf,"I always felt like Teen Wolf scripts were written by Mr. Garrison.

https://youtu.be/At9JJ78hij0"
Teen Wolf,He probably shouldn't have been posing for any magazine as a teenager.
Teen Wolf,Ugh. Old white men think gayness is contagious or something. You won’t suddenly worship the peen because you chatted with a gay dude for 10 minutes.
Teen Wolf,I call bullshit. TV and Movie executives love ticking off boxes so they can get brownie points to make it seem like they're inclusive and have been doing so for years. He's probably just trying to get some free publicity.
Teen Wolf,A pedo magazine it sounds like.
Teen Wolf,he posed for a gay magazine AS A TEENAGER??? WTF??????????
Teen Wolf,How old was he? I didn’t see the age. 16 y/o teen or 19 y/o teen? There’s a difference in my mind.
Teen Wolf,Is he Honey-Dickin?
Teen Wolf,We’re mad about rumors about casting directors doing due diligence in private now? Even when they already ended up making the right decision? You can’t think of *anything* else to be upset about?
Teen Wolf,Whhhhhhhhoooooooooo ccccaaaaaarrreeeesssss
Teen Wolf,It is not sad that after he is out of the closet he is only cast on gay characters. also the same happens to zachary quinto
Teen Wolf,Who cares they should have been proud of you I am
Teen Wolf,"Wait, how old was he?  Was he a teen or was he an adult?? One is fine, the other is pedophilia."
Teen Wolf,"Hold up, what time is this gay teen wolf show on it sounds sexy and interesting"
Teen Wolf,Ok I came up here hoping to find a link to that magazine picture ...
Teen Wolf,Isn’t that a plus ?
Teen Wolf,"gay kids who want to pose for magazines is their entire audience, tf"
Teen Wolf,Is he a good actor is all
Teen Wolf,Ok…….
Teen Wolf,Star of show complains about how show wouldn’t make him the star. Really?! Obviously you’re wrong
Teen Wolf,Who gives a shit
Teen Wolf,"Why this may be a win for the gay-card

I can see why MTV made that play, In this climate your show can be stopped for having a cast member that had involvement in the Adult Industry. Especially when advertising and viewership involves minors.                                     

All that being said him posing for a Gay adult magazine may have been his saving grace. They got in front of it quickly and gay is a huge part of this planets voice."
Teen Wolf,[deleted]
Teen Wolf,"That’s why you wait until you’re no longer a teenager to pose for a gay *men’s* magazine!  
  
^/s"
Teen Wolf,Whereas nowadays you don't get a gig unless you have posed for such a magazine.
Teen Wolf,Why was a teenager “posing” in a magazine for gay men? Creepy shit
Teen Wolf,"I remember seeing those photos of him. I knew he was gay from the beginning. He has a lot of trauma, and with trauma, comes reflection."
Teen Wolf,Wait what? I thought Colton Haynes used to date the women who played Felicity in Arrow lol. Is he bi or was that one of those fake Hollywood relationships?
Teen Wolf,Mental illness is a hell of a thing. God damn queers
Teen Wolf,"I mean, if it is porn, then yeah. You can't be a role model if you do porn.

FHM, Maxim--borderline porn."
Teen Wolf,I thought MTV was woke now. 90s MTV would have hired him in a heart beat.
Teen Wolf,"Times have really changed in the last 10 years. For the better, other than the pandemic. That can DIAF."
Teen Wolf,Expose them and make sure they never have a job again
Teen Wolf,WTF?! Why would you attribute a death like that to him being gay?! That is just evil!
Teen Wolf,Apparently his dad only left a photo of him on the fridge from the year before he came out. Seems like it was a major reason
Teen Wolf,[removed]
Teen Wolf,"It was kinda disrespectful representation. It was only used to entice horny teenage girls. I absolutely hated the queer baiting they did with stiles.


Idk why I'm getting downvoted. I watched the show, the entire thing is just a thirst trap"
The Smurfs,"Loesch is pretty much directly responsible for X-Men TAS getting made. She was formerly head of Marvel's animation division, which bizarrely didn't produce shows about Marvel characters but instead shows such as Muppet Babies... until they did a pilot for an X-Men show named Pryde of the X-Men. 

It failed but when Loesch went on to be President of Fox kids a few years later, she heavily, heavily pushed for X-Men to be the next comic property to adapt after BTAS' success (the mega successful Jim Lee relaunch of the comic at the time didn't hurt though)."
The Smurfs,That is one hell of a resume! Turns out I am a fan of Margaret Loesch.
The Smurfs,"Oh, shit! Hell yeah!

Hasbro scouted her a few years back to head The Hub, their attempt at a cable network; I hope this’ll cover that rise and fall. Wait...

> co-directed by one of the *Toys that Made Us* guys

Ah, shit."
The Smurfs,"Wow, my childhood shows in a nutshell huh? Did she win the presidential Medal of Freedom?"
The Smurfs,Didn’t know this person was so instrumental to my childhood!
The Smurfs,What's wrong with *The Toys that Made Us*?
The Smurfs,She lost her job thanks to Rupert Murdoch.
The Smurfs,"You know what, I’m gonna say it, fuck that guy. Do not like him.

I have a kid almost old enough to watch those old shows, but most of them are only available to buy on Amazon and their modern streaming reincarnations are absolute garbage."
The Smurfs,Now the question is will this be Ducktales and be really good or will it be a Powerpuff Girls and suck ass.
The Smurfs,"Ugh, and of course it’s going the be the creepy cgi Smurfs."
The Smurfs,"Serious question: Why? Was there a lot of clamoring for Smurfs to come back? Do they have a dedicated fanbase I'm unaware of? It seems like a dated IP that won't die, like Marmaduke. I get some stuff from the 80s getting revived and brought back, but this, Alvin and the Chipmunks, and a handful of others I don't get the fascination with trying to bring into the modern entertainment. 


Some shows like Scooby Doo or Bugs Bunny I feel are timeless. Some like say Voltron or Thundercats I can even see being given a modern take as they are action and have the potential for better stories to be told with advances in animation. I don't see Smurfs as being particularly interesting or having anything new to add. The answer is clearly money, but how big is the demographic that can't wait to get back to Smurfs?"
The Smurfs,"Since it's Nick, I'm guessing they won't deal with the plotholes like how Papa Smurf keeps power in his cult of personality statist/socialist dictatorship or how short of constantly gang-banging Smurfette, how they maintain population numbers with no other females in the entire community, not to mention the inbreeding issue."
The Smurfs,"This is Nick we’re talking about here

You know the answer"
The Smurfs,"> Serious question: Why?

Well with the Live-action films being over there is now room for a tv show

>It seems like a dated IP that won't die

Well its is popular thats why"
The Smurfs,"> but this, Alvin and the Chipmunks, and a handful of others I don't get the fascination with trying to bring into the modern entertainment.

There are two major reasons. 

The first is any known franchise is easier to sell to executives/market. Like, I can make a new Masters of the Universe series or Ollie's Pack (actual new show on Nick). 

Most people don't need to be sold on Masters of the Universe, this is He-Man, his associates, Skeletor, Castle Greyskull... it's all there. There is also endless marketing opportunities. You want a big event? Add Faker and now it's an event where a notable character is back to do stuff. 

As for Ollie's Pack, well, I guess Nick says it's a show about a backpack that takes you to a world of monsters. So, now I have to market this new idea. I have to legitimately attempt to create a narrative or major event that excites kids. I need something that shows why this series is worth your time and will actually turn a profit at some point. 

The other is that you're far more likely to be successful with any known IP than any unknown IP. More people will check out The Smurfs, simply because they know it and are curious, than willing to watch Ollie's Pack (I swear I know nothing about this show, I just am using it to prove a point). 

>  or Thundercats

This is also why we get things like the new series Thundercats Roar. It's just easier across the board and, as a result, it happens quite often."
The Smurfs,"In todays animation business its much easier to relaunch something that at least worked before, even if its a dusty franchise like tge smurfs, than to launch something new. There are lots of good pitches for new and fresh content, but the industry often just wants more of the same. Taking real risks like at the golden time spongebob was created, those days are pretty much over."
The Smurfs,Blue Spongebob
The Smurfs,They’ll give it no promotion air it once and dump the rest of the season on nicktoons or online
The Smurfs,[deleted]
The Smurfs,Genius
The Smurfs,What does this mean for the animaniacs reboot???
The Smurfs,I just now saw this and it truly hurt my heart... this was my downtime vice while in college...
The Smurfs,I'm gonna need a little more information here.
The Smurfs,King Smurf I think it’s called. Where “Brainy” become King after “Papa Smurf” leaves and starts putting everyone in prison. Some escape and come back to overthrow him. Kind of a dark episode.
The Smurfs,[It's available on YouTube.](https://youtu.be/KG3mPGpLg68)
The Smurfs,really sound  similar to the second book but its a random smurf that became king 
The Smurfs,Thanks.
The Smurfs," I bought the Looney Tunes Golden collection on Amazon and it is one of the single greatest purchases any human has ever made

Looney Tunes Golden Collection Vol. 1-6 (6-Pack) https://www.amazon.com/dp/B005NFJAQC/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_apap_qTd8563QJLAW3


Also you could find a lot if them on Kodi and probably some on seriesonline. io"
The Smurfs,"Get the app Pluto on your phone, they have a channel that shows old cartoons"
The Smurfs,I think you can subscribe to Cartoon Network's Boomerang to stream lots of old stuff.
The Smurfs,Boomerang has all the Hanna barbera stuff if you are in the US 
The Smurfs,"BUT WHAT ABOUT TIME SQUAD?! OR MEGAS XLR?! 

seriously. someone find these for me please. I'm stoned."
The Smurfs,On Kodi look at the phoenix add on - there is a cartoon channel on phoenix that has tons of older cartoons -
The Smurfs,Is everyone here too stupid to see that this post was made to draw attention to the new Boomerang streaming service? Convenient that every show op listed will be available on the service. This post was paid for. Fake news!!!
The Smurfs,"Do you mean in the state of Massachusetts or ""en masse?""

Just kidding! Honestly, for some of the older ones your only option might be a comic book store that also sells movies. They often have tons of old crap amongst which you might get lucky. "
The Smurfs,[deleted]
The Smurfs,kimcartoon.me has all of these for free
The Smurfs,Very good question. I will also wait for an answer.
The Smurfs,Get an Amazon Fire Stick and download the Kodi app.
The Smurfs,"Is this a joke?

Edit: I guess I meant to say that this is a legit question I've had for a while. When I was a kid, I did watch a lot of Boomerang (until it started airing cartoon network ads that I hated). That's why there's a lot of shows that were on boom..... because I loved watching them. My dad also watched them when he was a kid so it's good for conversation as well. I guess it kind of looks like an ad except for the fact that I wouldn't mind finding the episodes for download for free."
The Smurfs,Is it http://www.ljsilvers.com?
The Smurfs,Bobby's World. What else is there?
The Smurfs,Johnny Bravo was my favorite.
The Smurfs,Animaniacs - available on Netflix.
The Smurfs,"Honestly? Road Rovers. I still feel like it was so underrated.

Digimon and Powerpuff Girls are honorable mentions. To this day, Digimon is the only anime I have a tolerance for watching dubbed.

When I was a poor kid and we only had PBS, it was Sagwa."
The Smurfs,Pirates of Dark Water was easily my favorite cartoon as a kid.
The Smurfs,"Maybe a bit before some people's time on here but original Scooby Doo, Space Ghost, Inch Eye Private Eye, Hong Kong Phooey, Battle of the Planets ... this is when cartoons were cartoons!!"
The Smurfs,M.A.S.K. - loved that show. Watched every morning before school
The Smurfs,Batman: The Animated Series
The Smurfs,Thundercats. HOEEEEEE!
The Smurfs,I was obsessed with Scooby Doo as a child. I also loved Inspector Gadget and The Smurfs.
The Smurfs,My very favorite: Gargoyles.
The Smurfs,"Too many to name but loved the anime of G-Force (Battle of the Planets) and Voltron (the Lion team, didn't care much for the Vehicle team)."
The Smurfs,Chip and Dale Rescue Rangers!!
The Smurfs,"GI Joe, Transformers, He-Man, Thundercats, Get Along Gang, Pac Man, Brave Starr, Scooby Doo."
The Smurfs,Exosquad
The Smurfs,captain planet
The Smurfs,"Not a lot of [C.O.P.S.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy4YFDSDW4w) mentions here and that's a *crime* (lololol. no. awful).


That one was a classic.  Animaniacs too.  Gargoyles.  


Darkwing Duck maybe?

WAIT A MINUTE - x-MEN wins.  Hands down.  That X-Men cartoon was the greatest. "
The Smurfs,Not sure if it was a Sunday morn one dragon ball z
The Smurfs,X-Men of course.
The Smurfs,I had no idea. THANKS!
The Smurfs,"You and I are the same people. I was born in '76, and that must have been the sweet spot for these. =)"
The Smurfs,"punny, dad"
The Smurfs,"I need to rewatch. Wow. Forgot about this, and I was a Claremont kid in the 80's. That show was a shock that it actually happened, I think. So cool!"
The Smurfs,"I love Animal Kingdom. The current season is not as great as the previous ones,but the first 4 were great."
The Smurfs,"It felt like a ripoff of Peaky Blinders but in modern times and Americanized. Finn Cole is in both shows and pretty much played the same role. To me, it isn't as good as Peaky Blinders."
The Smurfs,"Agreed it's a fun show, but I am not into these ""Young Smurf"" flashbacks AT ALL and it seems to be 50% of the show now."
The Smurfs,"I know a art school teacher who gushes about this show and has frequently recommend it to her students.

However, she is extremely homophobic."
The Smurfs,Watched the first season. Came across to me as a low rent FX crime drama
The Smurfs,"Great observation, it really is but the mommy issue stuff turned me off and I was absolutely out after they started with the flash back. The more this show tried to be ""deep"" the less interesting it got for me. Not that I don't like insightful and analytical story telling but this show was taking itself way too seriously for a bunch of crooks who steal things and surf."
The Smurfs,This show is fantastic!! Binge watched three seasons in a couple weeks!
The Smurfs,I’m waiting for season4 to finish to binge it.
The Smurfs,"Great description of the show, and I live  about 15 miles from there I think I’ll go tomorrow sounds exciting"
The Smurfs,"I just recently learned it's based off a real family. Well the movie was inspired by the family, and the show is inspired by the movie"
The Smurfs,"Forgive me, what is a GTA show?"
The Smurfs,I gave up on the TV show since the movie was far better.  The story became utterly unbelievable in the longer format.
The Smurfs,Its based on the movie
The Smurfs,"I liked the show, but was always thinking that costumes looked like second hand store shops, particularly some of the lesser characters!

Smurf was so edgy I suppose that the rest of the females just looked a bit trashy!

The house is just an amazing design!"
The Smurfs,It's entertaining but it gets quite repetitive and the characters are very shallow and barely emote which gets exhausting.
The Smurfs,"It definitely isn't, it doesn't really know what to do with the characters and it gets extremely repetitive."
The Smurfs,"Yeah I feel the same, she is so unlikable that it just makes it a slog to sit through."
The Smurfs,It has really gone to shit this season.
The Smurfs,One of the main characters is gay.
The Smurfs,How the fuck does one become enamored enough with art to be a teacher but remain homophobic?
The Smurfs,"It’s Sons of Anarchy SoCal surfer edition. The movie is really good, but the show is the tv equivalent of fast food - it’s enjoyable when you are craving it, but I’m not gonna pretend you’re missing much if you skip it"
The Smurfs,15 miles is the length of about 22148.63 'Ford F-150 Custom Fit Front FloorLiners' lined up next to each other.
The Smurfs,gta as in grand theft auto
The Smurfs,I think you may have watched a different movie than me? I watched it after finishing season 4 waiting for 5 and thought it was one of the worst things I've ever watched.
The Smurfs,Oh. Right on. I’ve never played that but I have seen this show.
The Smurfs,"The movie is very different to the show, it was relatively acclaimed on release though and I think it's a pretty good piece of modern Australian film. Again, the show and the film are nothing alike except for the fact that they are about a crime family."
The Smurfs,My biggest issue with the movie is it moved so quick. They left a lot of the character development out and just expected you to figure it out. The only reason I had any idea who was who and what they were about was because of the show.
The Smurfs,"The characters are also so different. The film is a pretty disturbing portrayal of a part of society that is heavily controlled by drugs and violent crime and how people within this bubble respond to it in a cyclical nature. The show kind of starts out with some similar themes but ultimately it's just a bunch of guys who do heists and go surfing a lot, it's a way more superficial look at those themes and kind of misses the point in some ways, I think. Not to say the show is bad because of it, just that it's completely different and doesn't really even attempt to do the same things that the film does."
The Smurfs,"tell this person nothing, they're obviously an intern or younger executive looking to advance"
The Smurfs,Looking forward to CW's dark gritty reboot of Bob the Builder.
The Smurfs,Pokémon
The Smurfs,I feel like Jackie Chan Adventures was the last unironic action cartoon based on an actual person.
The Smurfs,The 1992 X-men was pretty good too
The Smurfs,"> Cartoons shown nowadays is not worth watching. 

I disagree with your premise (and too a lesser extent your grammar).
Recent cartoons that are great and aimed at kids include:
**Gravity Falls** (2012-2016)
**Star Wars: The Clone Wars / Rebels** (2008/2014)
**Lost in Oz** (2015)
**Trollhunters** (2016)
**The Legend of Korra** (2012)

It's also a great time for cartoons aimed at adults with:
**Rick and Morty**
**Castlevania**

Also some of the shows you mentioned really don't hold up to modern scrutiny, especially Pokémon.

"
The Smurfs,You need to watch Avatar The Last Airbender 
The Smurfs,What about Freakazoid.
Totally Spies!,Can't wait to see what new fetishes they tackle.
Totally Spies!,Used to watch this as a kid alongside martin mystery and some cartoon about parasites although it might have been just martin mystery...
Totally Spies!,The only cartoon were the gals change clothes every episodes. big props
Totally Spies!,YES finally a revival I can get behind.
Totally Spies!,"I'm impressed by the surprising longevity of the series. It always seems to return. 

&#x200B;

If you're interested in revisiting the show or getting into Totally Spies!, all six seasons are on Amazon Prime."
Totally Spies!,"The only thing I really remember about this show was that every time the old man had an assignment for the girls he would forcibly kidnap them from their school using some really elaborate mechanical trap and transport them to his secret base.

I always admired that; most people would get lazy after a while and just call them on their phones to tell them about their next spy assignment or whatever. Not this guy — he has to traumatize them at the start of every single workday without fail. It’s like my grandma used to say, “you have to commit the bit!”"
Totally Spies!,[removed]
Totally Spies!,"This show can never truly die, and I'm here for it."
Totally Spies!,"Ah yes, the show that would lead me to fire up that dial-up and discover hentai for the first time."
Totally Spies!,Do people not remember this show had a great canon ending where they removed evil from the world? How does it make sense to make more seasons following the story?
Totally Spies!,Haven't we known this for like a year?
Totally Spies!,This was from January. Why post this now like it’s new news?
Totally Spies!,Martin Mystery next
Totally Spies!,Is it gonna be as weirdly sexual as the original?
Totally Spies!,Here we go again.
Totally Spies!,I do hope it focuses on them as single women in their late-30s inexplicably still living together on the same affluent Beverly Hills house with Jerry now a head on a robot body.
Totally Spies!,I remember in like 2014 I was friends with this girl whose boyfriend got drunk and started talking about how when he was a teen he had a crush on Sam from Totally Spies and he used to jerk off to her all the time after he came home from school and turned on Cartoon Network lmao I was like “ah cool”
Totally Spies!,"This show, teen titans, code lyoko, megas XLR and fosters home changed the way I viewed animation /art for the better.

Miguzi was the shit when you came home from school and I hate how they ended it"
Totally Spies!,Someone realized there were fetishes they still hadn't used
Totally Spies!,Now give me Martin Mystery.
Totally Spies!,Meh. Lemme know when Martin Mystery returns.
Totally Spies!,Ok what about Martin Mystery’s
Totally Spies!,Are they preschoolers now? That's all the rage these days. Ruining cartoons from my teen years by turning the characters into infants. CN is about to do it again to Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends.
Totally Spies!,"I remember they played this show at a dentist I'd go to.

I enjoyed Nick more than CN because they had more live action shows didnt solely depend on animated shows."
Totally Spies!,Ah totally spies a friend told me it’s one of the shows who “made” her gay…oh god are we finally going to get the yuri bait episode that she has always joked about.
Totally Spies!,"Let’s be honest...

More guys watch this show than girls do. 😂"
Totally Spies!,"Don’t even know what this is, but was reminded of the movie Top Secret."
Totally Spies!,This show was never good. Most episodes were just The Writers’ Barely Disguised Fetish. Look it up and prepare to have your childhood ruined.
Totally Spies!,Oh my god. I loved this show!!
Totally Spies!,Why are you linking an article from January? This isn't news.
Totally Spies!,Has it really been 20 years?
Totally Spies!,Hot Take: GLADIS wasn’t terrible.
Totally Spies!,French fetish fuel French fetish fuel French fetish fuel!!!
Totally Spies!,Who’s ready to discover some new fetishes?
Totally Spies!,Please help save The Wilds by signing our petition found on IG wildwavescampaign. Thank you so much 🥹 #RenewTheWilds #SaveTheWilds
Totally Spies!,I was born on 2001 (aka when the first season aired) so I grew up with the show. I think what made ts popular was the aesthetics of the show and the personalities of the characters. Back then and even now I can’t name one cartoon show that’s exactly like totally spies or that got so much creativity and thought to every episode like ts.
Totally Spies!,"What I really miss about this show is

Clover: *getting a new crush every 2 sec*"
Totally Spies!,"The better question is, which haven't they tackled???"
Totally Spies!,"I never saw this show, was that a thing?"
Totally Spies!,"I really liked that episode when one of the spies transform into a lizard, that really awaken something in me (im not a furry but)"
Totally Spies!,Time to see what else it will awaken.
Totally Spies!,"I enjoyed this show as a child. I always wanted to be secretly contacted to join a spy agency while totally worrying about what’s going on in math class and if Billy totally thinks I’m cute. 


Speaking of fetishes, I wonder if they’re gonna add modern commentary to the show like making one of them a lesbian."
Totally Spies!,That’s a bad pov
Totally Spies!,"For me it was Totally Spies, Teen Titans, Naruto and Pokemon. 

I watched a lot of Cartoons but these were my favorites including Powerpuff Girls and Total Drama Island."
Totally Spies!,Evolution?
Totally Spies!,Ozzy & Drix?
Totally Spies!,Martin Mystery was the shit
Totally Spies!,"Idk why i, as a kid, thought totally spies and martin mystery were rival shows lol. Whenever totally spies was on, I got mad cuz it wasn't martin mystery lmao."
Totally Spies!,Code Lyoko?
Totally Spies!,"Xiaolin Showdown also had Kimiko change clothes every episode, it was just her but I always appreciated it."
Totally Spies!,"Yes, their outfits single-handedly motivated me to get into clothing design, then realizing how hard of a career that was I transitioned into graphic design.

Miguzi on Cartoon Network really made me the artist I am today, so many styles of shows in a short block after school."
Totally Spies!,"As Told by Ginger, had the entire set of characters have ever changing outfits."
Totally Spies!,Show me a nude Tayne
Totally Spies!,"Curious. This is already the second revival. 

I just find it a little odd because Season 5 ended with a 2-parter where they eradicated all evil in the world through some Deus Ex Machina thingy (if I recall correctly). So it was a pretty damn definitive ending.

But then Season 6 cropped up and the writers didn't even bother to come up with any kind of excuse. Just back to business as usual."
Totally Spies!,"Is it free with Prime, or do you have to pay for it?"
Totally Spies!,THANK YOU. Def on my list!!
Totally Spies!,"Hey, Spymasters gotta Spymaster."
Totally Spies!,I love the dissonance between the first and second part of that sentence.
Totally Spies!,Something about the simplicity and candor of this comment is extremely funny to me. Like idk what any of us are supposed to do with this info but I’m still glad you shared it
Totally Spies!,"Which one was your go to, me personally I prefer clover."
Totally Spies!,We can only hope.
Totally Spies!,Probably not since they might offend someone.
Totally Spies!,This was many younger folks introduction into to powerful women unfortunately. I’ve heard this narrative way to many times to write it off as a joke or conspiracy at this point.
Totally Spies!,Yep
Totally Spies!,Code lyoko had the crunichiest animation I’ve ever seen
Totally Spies!,Code lyoko definitely awakened something in me
Totally Spies!,Man I miss Code Lyoko
Totally Spies!,Why am I laughing this is so bad
Totally Spies!,"No, you’ll get Sam, Alex and Clover (and hot cartoon boys)"
Totally Spies!,Maybe they'll have another crossover.
Totally Spies!,"This is actually a Canadian show, and they only go with the “child reboots” when there is immense pressure from Cartoon Network because the show had a cult following but never made them a solid return on the investment.

6teen and totally spies definitely recouped so they’ll be fine vs total drama island which had many financial setbacks (my older sister was a VA for the show)"
Totally Spies!,"Funny, as I kid I gradually moved from Nick to CN because I couldn’t stand the live-action stuff. Heh."
Totally Spies!,No
Totally Spies!,That’s what made it good tho…
Totally Spies!,"God that 4chan list of fetish shit was ridiculous and funny. They really started reaching after like number 2. ""Theres an episode where the girls get fat"" ""thats clearly a reference to the body enlarging fetish!"""

Sherlock,"Sherlock was brilliant, clever, high energy modern take on the Sherlock Holmes trope.

Unfortunately, as it went on, it kinda lost the plot. It became self-referential, overly convoluted, glib and superficial. 

I’d rate the first six-or-so episodes of Sherlock as “absolutely awesome”; but the later ones were a bit of a mess. Much less fun."
Sherlock,"If a modern take on Sherlock is what you're after, try Elementary.

His addiction is portrayed realistically,  and we get to see him solve problems on a smaller scale instead of saving the world from a madman every episode."
Sherlock,If you have the time to spare Hbomberguys discusses it here. [https://youtu.be/LkoGBOs5ecM](https://youtu.be/LkoGBOs5ecM)
Sherlock,"I believe the answer is ""not really"".

While problems were present from the very first episode, it soon became apparent that the writers had no idea of what a ""smart"" character is. Sherlock is an ignorant person's idea of what a genius is. As the episodes went on it moved to become more and more outlandish and it is basically played as having access to ""magic"" rather than deduction and analysis. 

A better version is Johnny Lee Miller's Elementary. Sherlock is actually shown putting in the work (all nighters, near constant training), using the help of experts in the field rather the just knowing all that happens to be relevant to the plot and putting pieces together.

Even just comparing the first episode makes things more apparent on second viewing. BBC's Sherlock just yells ""Pink!"" while CBS' Sherlock find a safe room by noticing the slight inclination of the ground, walks several times on it, and then proceeds to explain and show how he reached that conclusion."
Sherlock,"Along with game of thrones Sherlock is one of those shoes that for me went from must-see to never want to hear about again. 

I think beyond the 2nd season it takes a real nosedive into cutesy self-indulgence, and essentially solving problems with magic & hand waving, it’s a real shame because the cast & setup for the series was great"
Sherlock,I think Elementary is the better portrayal of Sherlock Holmes.
Sherlock,"God no. Elementary did way better. Hell, Case Closed did better. 

BBC Sherlock is a superhero. It seems to have a strong dislike of the original stories for some reason. At least that what I felt. What they did to Irene Adler was a travesty."
Sherlock,"Started out strong, then went off the rails by the last season unfortunately. 

I think it’s strange that the actor who played Watson gave off Kim Cattrall levels of hatred from the experience, but then started warming up to the idea of doing another series of it recently. Makes you wonder what changed besides $$."
Sherlock,[deleted]
Sherlock,"Sherlock imo peaked at The Reichenbach Fall everything after fell off extremely hard, but that episode was so good."
Sherlock,"did they ever actually explain how he survived jumping off the roof?

after like 3 different explanations I kind of quit paying attention"
Sherlock,"I think it was much better as a Sherlock Holmes adaptation than it was as a show, TBH. 

The main whole-show adaptational issue that I had a problem with was Holmes's characterization. Holmes in the books/stories isn't outright rude and dismissive to anyone except, arguably, Lestrade and other detectives; he's not social, but he's polite and sometimes downright gallant when the case calls for it. The Sherlock version was just rude and off-putting and while I think that otherwise the canonical Holmes's eccentricities were well captured, his completely antisocial nature in the show was over the top.

Otherwise, though, with the exception of one-off issues like Irene Adler (though in fairness I don't know if it's really possible to get her right...?), I think that Sherlock actually worked very well. There were changes, but most of them felt rooted in SOMETHING from canon. Obviously Watson needed no changes, he was just perfect, but Lestrade was great, Moriarty was... well, I didn't like Moriarty but he was fine relative to canon, Mycroft... again, I didn't LIKE him but all the changes made to his character basically worked within canon. And of course the show included London as a character in a way that I thought worked brilliantly- I could *not* buy Elementary being a Holmes adaptation because Sherlock Holmes doesn't live in Brooklyn...! The show also did a stellar job of peppering in references from canon that were beautifully done, and initially the show's adaptations of canon were very solid. 

It's when the show decided to be a show in its own right that it really flopped. Moffat and Gatiss decided that they didn't just want to be Holmes, they wanted to be *smarter* than Holmes, *better* than Holmes, and so a lot of stuff just ended up not working. In the beginning, everything was spectacular enough and the acting/production design were good enough to paper in the cracks, but eventually they showed through as everything started to get too wild and out of control. 

I actually think that the seeds for the show's destruction were laid a lot earlier than they might seem- in S1E3. I think that, as effective as the scavenger-hunt plot may have been in the moment, it set the stage for a show in which the mystery of the week no longer mattered and it was all about big showstopper spectacles. The stakes were too high, and you can't really have that in a Holmes show, where the point is that after each book or short story they can just bounce back to where they came from unscathed. It wasn't that long a journey from there to big bombastic plots that the show couldn't really sustain realistically."
Sherlock,"I know this is dumb but my biggest problem with Sherlock is the game the villain plays in the first episode. There’s a Nash equilibrium to that game. 

Even if he does have insight into your thought process,  if you flip a coin his insight no longer matters, and the best he can do is flip a coin too."
Sherlock,"No. It missed what the original stories were about - pointing out the various social flaws and prejudices of the british empire. And was inept at portraying engaging crime stories, never explaining how Holmes came to the conclusions he did, a staple of the stories and the character."
Sherlock,I thought the first season did a solid job of it.  It meandered way too far away from the plot as it went on.  Still really enjoyable to watch but for truly capturing Sherlock I don't think it was the best.
Sherlock,"Yes, then sort of, then no"
Sherlock,I enjoyed it more than the old stuff
Sherlock,Bilbo is the best Johnlock movie. Change my mind.
Sherlock,I loved Sherlock but imo season 3 ending ruined the show. Just stupid and never sat right with me. Especially how they decided to start season 4 after hiatus.
Sherlock,"For my money the show went off the deep-end pretty quickly.  A great opening episode doesn’t make a great show.

There was very little actual deduction.  Usually Sherlock figures it out through crazy levels of knowledge.  For instance knowing all the flight numbers in/out of Heathrow.  That level of rote memorization makes for kind of boring character options."
Sherlock,It was great until it shat its own dick off
Sherlock,"Elementary was a better version. They put way more attention into character building and story telling. You knew that Sherlock was a real human that did his job very well. However, when watching Sherlock you could see that they went out of their way to make the main character unlikable. they made him the smartest person in the room and he was arrogant enough to be surprised when they realized it. But I did prefer Martin Freeman to Lucy Liu."
Sherlock,We watched it in school and I really enjoyed it. The last season was completely wacky even for those of us who haven’t read the original stories
Sherlock,"The first two series were really good. After that, things got really weird.

Their reimagined version of The Hound of the Baskervilles however was much better than the book! I even picked up on one of the important hidden tells in the plot!"
Sherlock,"Season 1 Ep. 1, is a prime example of exactly that"
Sherlock,"I wish, after 2 seasons, it had moved into 30 minutes episodes, and followed a singular short story each time. 

I still enjoyed it all, but it strayed way into self indulgence / continual need to top itself.

I did enjoy the ""Victorian Flashback"" episode though."
Sherlock,"It was a great show, My problem with it (and other BBC shows like DrWho), is the complete inconsistency in the release schedule.  It could go years between seasons/series.  And even between episodes it just seemed random.  It's frustrating and very hard to keep interest and motivation.

This is speaking from an American (BBC America), maybe the release schedules in the UK were timely, I dunno."
Sherlock,I loved season 2 and enjoyed season 3 even as it crept closer to melodrama. Still a fun show. In S3 and moreso in S4 it became focused on clever moments and melodrama. Some of it was fantastic but S4 especially was a bit of a mess.
Sherlock,"I think it went off the rails pretty fast, honestly. They got too enamored with the budget that they could blow and the writing didn't live up to the original at all. The performances were good though."
Sherlock,"Yes in some places, no in others. This take on Watson was pretty great. The concepts of “detective consultant” and “criminal consultant” worked fairly well. 

The bizarre version of Irene Adler missed the mark for me. And towards the end the series really went off the rails."
Sherlock,"Looking back on it, they made him near supernatural, which at times took the joy out"
Sherlock,Elementary did it better
Sherlock,The show became about the writers and the actors and forgot to tell a story. The show crapped on its fans and created a toxic environment with johnLock. And they queerbaited with Moriaty The fact that they needed to bring up the big bad in the pilot episode was crazy to me.
Sherlock,No
Sherlock,"The first season, yes. Then it kind of went off the rails and became more of an action/adventure story?"
Sherlock,"I'm surprised how well liked it is, after the first few episodes. It just made less and less sense all the time. Nice visuals, nice directing, nice acting, worse and worse writing. 

And the handling of the whole ""death of Sherlock"" was infamously idiotic."
Sherlock,"Elementary>>>

BBC has a better portrayal of the setting but when it comes to the character of Sherlock himself Elementary did a better job and honestly that's what mattered most to me.

If you have read the books you would know that Sherlock wasn't socially callious as he is portrayed in the BBC show, he is just *very observant*, in that regard elementary did a way better job.

I love the BBC show for what it is, but I don't think it's exactly a good adaptation. It also felt pointless towards the end."
Sherlock,It was good at first but once it start going off the rails it did pretty fast. The fact that people abruptly stopped talking about the show after season 2 should speak for itself.
Sherlock,"House M.D. is a better modernization than Sherlock, change my mind"
Sherlock,"it started great, then Moffatt and Gatiss got so far up their own arses it became an ego driven shitfest. Vastly prefer the Ritchie movies (especially the second), they modernised Holmes by only amplifying something that was already in the books for spectacle reasons, so in that sense you could say it was more faithful to the source as well. 
Edit: eh, downvotes. Course people can disagree but I'd like to engage in a discussion about what they found wrong in the post?"
Sherlock,"As somebody who had seen the actual pilot of the show and thought that was really good, I was immensely disappointed by what they considered the actual canonical episode 1.

They basically changed sherlock to be more superhuman and relegated Watson to be superfluous. While in the pilot Watson plays an important role and Sherlock is much more human."
Sherlock,"I thought the first two series of Sherlock were fun, although I never really was under the impression that it was a mystery series. I didn't follow any lines of reasonings that the titular character seemed to have. With Scooby Doo, I could easily follow along and deduce mysteries and one of the things I loved about it was how it rewarded viewers for paying attention. Sherlock doesn't do this and from what I understand about Arthur Conan Doyle's classics, the mystery element was actually there.

 Honestly, the true mystery was discovering what Moffat was going to pull out of his ass the following episode."
Sherlock,"Not really. ""Misanthropic savant"" is very popular these days. But that's not who Sherlock was. 

Cumberbatch: ""I'm not a psychopath I'm a high functioning sociopath."" Yeah, no. In the show Sherlock autistically plans a bachelor party down to milliliters of alcohol. In the stories Watson persuades Sherlock to vacation at his friends villa by assuring him it's guys only and they can live it up."
Sherlock,It was great.
Sherlock,"Absolutely, season 1 was ""wow this is surprisingly good and a lot more true to the books than expected"" and season 2 was just amazing. 

It went off the rails pretty quickly after that but I don't regret watching it and as ridiculous as season 4 was, I'd probably watch another season even though the s4 finale had a nice finality to it"
Sherlock,Yes.
Sherlock,The first two seasons were great. Then the show disappeared up its own ass and became unwatchable.
Sherlock,It was a great show IMHO that I wish we got more of.
Sherlock,No
Sherlock,"My gut says there's a connection to how the BSG reboot went off the rails, with its grandiose ambitions for being sublimely clever at every turn biting it in its ass.

Or it could have just been cocaine in the writer's room. IIRC film critic Roger Ebert blamed that drug for a lot of the insane drivel that Hollywood had produced. Everything sounds great to those using it, but then eventually you have to film it, and edit it."
Sherlock,Yes
Sherlock,BBC'a Sherlock got v v shit towards the end
Sherlock,"It was popular for a reason... it was *fun* and it did all the things people expect of Sherlock Holmes:

* Sherlock and Irene Adler as an OTP
* Moriarity as a Big Bad and constant presence
* Sherlock comes up with solutions to cases no-one else can solve
* Sherlock is eccentric
* Lestrade as an object of fun

These aren't necessarily features from the original stories but they're the expected ideas that now exist (and did so ten/fifteen years ago, too).

And it also just generally shared features with good television:

* The cast was charismatic, 
* The two leads were fun to watch together
* Its opening was so good, [someone made this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLdBuoL3aCE)
* You understood why the show had characters... what their function/role within the show was

It lost popularity because actually, yeah, it needed a proper explanation for how Sherlock survived its version of the Final Problem. And that last point became increasingly less true. Obviously that extends to Mary but also its take on the ""third Holmes brother hypothesis"". That hypothesis is fun, but it's based on the idea that Mycroft is *not* the eldest sibling. Having the third sibling be a sister and evil would've been conceptually sound if only she'd been the eldest sibling.

To use an analogy... Sherlock started to get high on its own supply.

That being said, the audience is probably still there if they were to make another series or a special. I'm not sure how you *would* win back the naysayers; maybe the way forward is just to just do the Blue Carbuncle as a Christmas special and not reference the unpopular decisions in any way whatsoever."
Sherlock,It was great up until the final season. Especially the last two episodes
Sherlock,It was good until they introduced the sister.
Sherlock,"Sherlock Holmes was decidedly a loyal member of his class, and the order endowed by the British Empire, under Queen Victoria. We don't get that sense from Sherlock. 

But it's still a high quality show, and an interesting riff on Conan Doyle's character. All of the Jeremy Brett ones are on YouTube, and most seem to be in HD. Within the first few episodes you get a sense of Sherlock Holmes. Looking forward to the opera, a fine meal at an expensive restaurant that is now affordable, defending the Empire against a possible scandal, or possibly even spies, I didn't get that vibe from Sherlock, they made him a character more identifiable to the generation that made shows like Mr. Robot (which is genius) a success."
Sherlock,"The first two seasons, yes, after that it started to go down hill"
Sherlock,I can just link [HBomberGuy yelling about the boomerang scene for 5 minutes](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=-tCtj11lJ6w) to demonstrate why Sherlock doesn't function.
Sherlock,"I loved this show and thought it was great.

It did though after season 3 kind of jumped the shark but I loved all the characters on the show."
Sherlock,"I loved it, watched it a couple times."
Sherlock,"I actually really disagree. One of the reasons I don't like Sherlock is because I think it's a really uninteresting take on a ""modern"" Sherlock Holmes and that it didn't do nearly enough to separate itself from the ACD stories as a 21st century version of the character (and I think that's true for most of the characters). Elementary's take on a modern Sherlock was  lot more interesting and felt like there was a lot more work done to really imagine what that character would be like if he was born in, grew up in, and lived in the modern world. Moffat's Sherlock didn't feel like that. Really, it just felt like Moffat just kind of plopper ACD's Sherlock into a modern world and then combined him with a lot of the same sort of ""main character"" aspects (though mostly a lot of the negative ones) he used to write his version of the Doctor. So it ended up coming across less as ""what if Sherlock Holmes existed now"" and more like he just took ACD's Sherlock, made the tweaks to make the character more like his favorite kind of ""oh so smart"" hero, and put him in a modern day setting."
Sherlock,"After >!Sherlock fell of the roof and faked his death!< the show jumped the shark. It felt like the writers cared less about telling cool mysteries and were more focused on ‘mystery box’ and mind-bending plotlines to have fake “ah-ha!” moments.

I think >!killing Moriarty so early!< ruined the show because it felt like the writers were always trying to over-compensate and get back to what made those plots so good."
Sherlock,"BBC shows tend to have this problem I noticed.

Bodyguard was great up until the final episode when it just shit the bed completely. 

Peaky Blinders: The final season was just so bland and un-interesting.

Collateral had so many story arcs that went nowhere it was a waste of time.

Watching Killing Eve now, and so far the story is leading nowhere in the later seasons."
Sherlock,"> Unfortunately, as it went on, it kinda lost the plot. It became self-referential, overly convoluted, glib and superficial.

I feel/felt the same way about *Downton Abbey*: the earlier seasons were interesting as period pieces, but as thing went on it got a bit soap opera-ish. (I saw *Gosford Park* in theatres, and so was interested in *DA* when it first appeared)."
Sherlock,"It felt like they just wanted to modernize all of Sherlock's cases, but didn't have a clue what to do with the story endgame."
Sherlock,"First season, interesting if a bit self concious take

Season two, now we're cooking! really outstanding take and they leaned into it.

Season three plus... ok so we peaked in season 2...."
Sherlock,"Yes!

Sherlock started off somewhat decent but then fell into the same trap as Lost did where it wanted to subvert people’s expectations and messing everything up in the end.

It shouldn’t have come to no surprise, they already messed up the Hound of Baskerville, so the cracks were there.

So many ways of making a modern take and they went with a glow-in-the-dark bunny and Scarecrow’s fear toxins. No hound, just a dude’s imaginations.

It sucks, I liked the cast, but the storylines were… not that great… and I wonder if they had more episodes to flesh everything out would things make a difference (probably not.) 

‘Cause you can’t just drop a bombshell >!the frigging secret sibling!< and expect everything to mesh together peachy.

And then you have the Christmas Special…"
Sherlock,"Totally agree. If you watch until the Reichenbach Fall, it’s a great show. After that it goes downhill.

The Reichenbach Fall is one of my favorite episodes of TV ever."
Sherlock,"The first three.

The first episode of the second season still stands as the most precipitous drop in quality I've ever seen in a show. I would rather watch the worst season of *Law & Order* than return to *Sherlock*'s butchery of Irene Adler."
Sherlock,The last season was so stupid.
Sherlock,"I think series three was extremely good as well. Each of the first three series had one ""eh"" episode (s1e2, s2e2, and s3e1.) Series 4 had its moments but was much weaker.

And then also Abominable Bride was quite good."
Sherlock,"Yeah, the last season was a complete mess. The season before that and the Christmas special weren't good either."
Sherlock,"Agreed, the show fell off almost as hard as GOT. I absolutely loved the first 6 episodes, and even the 7th to a degree. But then it quickly went waaaaay downhill."
Sherlock,"It always baffled me that people always say they loved the first 2 seasons. The show is bad from the start. The first episode contains no conclusion to the mystery. We never find out how this guy knew what pill the person would take. Then the show keeps getting worse with gibberish mysteries. A guy doesn't feel that he's been stabbed because his uniform is so tight--whaaat?

The deductions are non-existent. Cases are resolved because Holmes is super smart, or resolving crimes with information that the audience didn't have access to prior to the reveal. And the abusive use of Moriarty is just ridiculous.
The show fails to reach the ever so promised apex and then never going for it, some examples being, Mary's having depth by betraying her comrades and then she is a saint or giving out Mr Smith as the murderer at the start of the episode having a twist just so that they untwist it by saying that Sherlock was always in control.

The only episode that really felt like a Sherlock Holmes mystery was The Hounds Of Baskerville, which everyone seemed to agree was the worst episode. So many episodes just didn't contain mysteries, only to showcase the actors and not a whole lot else.

Was there something--ANYTHING in the first two seasons I was missing that made the show seem as great as everyone claimed?"
Sherlock,It really went up its own ass. It started with modern interpretation of SH stories and then was about Sherlock then it was Sherlock about Sherlock within Sherlock.
Sherlock,"What I really appreciated about Elementary is they showed Sherlock doing the work. When he was on a case, he was constantly examining evidence and reviewing documents - nearly every “ah ha” moment was the result of hours of effort. When he wasn’t on a case, he was training or doing experiments to expand his knowledge or abilities for future cases. 

He was still shown as a singular mind with incredible abilities, but his solves felt earned because you saw how hard he worked for every solve. 

The BBC version was just Sherlock knowing everything instantly and loafing about."
Sherlock,"I thought the show started good, but after a while it stopped feeling like Sherlock Holmes. They changed the characters and their dynamic too much, and I eventually stopped watching."
Sherlock,Definitely my favorite modern Holmes and Watson.
Sherlock,"My favorite iteration, i’ve watched it through several times.

There’s nothing like the “mind palace” scene in Sherlock (I know the idea of a mind palace exists but it’s nothing like that), he’s just an extremely smart and resourceful recovering addict. I also like that it includes him struggling with his recovery, even relapsing once. 

Plus I love Lucy Liu’s watson, who actually contributes massively towards their endeavors, rather than mostly just being there to just say “Wow, that’s amazing Sherlock, how did you figure that out”

I really wish it had continued, I still felt like they were going strong"
Sherlock,I liked this version
Sherlock,"For me Gregory House the best version of Sherlock Holmes ever, including the original. House has an obsession and a compulsion to solve cases but it comes at a great price."
Sherlock,"That was fantastic.  I legitimatly laughed out loud when he said Moffett's purpose on Earth is to destroy British pop-culture contributions.

Dracula, Doctor Who, Sherlock, Jekyl - so true..."
Sherlock,I love how he rages at the boomerang thing. I felt a true kinship because I hated that damn thing too. It was so stupid.
Sherlock,"This video puts my general rage towards the show into words! As someone who read the stories and really enjoyed them, this show was terrible."
Sherlock,Honestly this video sums up why I don’t care for glass onion as well as the mystery is literally impossible to solve without the hidden knowledge that the film withholds until it is revealed as obvious.
Sherlock,"[I read this post](https://i.imgur.com/Hhw03Jj.png) years ago that really sums up what you said, about Sherlock being written as a smart person by people who aren't smart."
Sherlock,"I really loved the first episode, I was expecting a classic show after that but none of the others were that good tbh."
Sherlock,">While problems were present from the very first episode, it soon became apparent that the writers had no idea of what a ""smart"" character is. Sherlock is an ignorant person's idea of what a genius is.  
>  
>A better version is Johnny Lee Miller's Elementary. Sherlock is actually shown putting in the work (all nighters, near constant training), using the help of experts in the field rather the just knowing all that happens to be relevant to the plot and putting pieces together.

This is like the go-to criticism of the BBC show ever since 4chan and hbomberguy started ragging on it and it's a terrible criticism. This is literally what the original stories are. Sherlock Holmes *always* came out with some outrageous theory that nobody could ever have guessed. The reader wasn't supposed to work out it *with* him, they were supposed to sit in awe as he explained the ridiculous leaps of logic that lead him to his conclusion. Watson is the character that the reader is supposed to relate to and identify with, not Sherlock.

Conan Doyle wasn't exactly a genius himself. The man believed in the supernatural and fairies. Sherlock Holmes was born from his own pretty naïve understanding of how medical students could use methods of deduction to diagnose patients, which he decided to amplify x100 to create a character who was basically operating on a level beyond the understanding of us mere mortals.

There are plenty of legit criticisms of the show, but ""Sherlock is a wizard"" isn't a criticism of the show so much as it's just a criticism of the concept of Sherlock Holmes."
Sherlock,">Makes you wonder what changed besides $$.

probably time and perspective. They can change how you view certain things. Maybe he's had significantly worse experiences since and/or has bettered his relationships with people who made his experience worse."
Sherlock,"Oh wow, I just looked it up and I can't believe an s5 is even being theoretically discussed by the showrunners, I figured it'd been shadow cancelled. With the way the last season went it felt like they had so much contempt for it in the end. Did they think that the psychic dead sister and Saw traps was actually good Sherlock Holmes content? This whole production became so gd weird"
Sherlock,">Instead of being intelligent, observative, and drawing conclusions, he becomes some kind of super-human who pulls conclusions out of thin air.
It's like every guess he makes are only for plot points, no actual investigation... 

This is actually how I felt reading some of the Sherlock Holmes stories. I read The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes because I liked the Sherlock show so much, and was really disappointed with how some of the mysteries seemed to get solved from out of nowhere. It was frustrating as a reader. The show definitely does it as well and more than in the written stories. But I found it more bothersome in the stories."
Sherlock,">Instead of being intelligent, observative, and drawing conclusions, he becomes some kind of super-human who pulls conclusions out of thin air.

That's how the original stories were. There were lots of ""aha I had actually taken some extravagant action beforehand because I secretly had it all under wraps"" plot wrap-ups. It's like with House MD and his sudden epiphanies. It's the character and their personality and the stories about this larger than life character that people enjoyed. Now, people feel like they need to have an intelligent reasoned argument for something not being their cup of tea, and they end up repeating the first thing that sounds like it fits those requirements. It's okay to not like Sherlock, but don't pretend you think it's because it strayed from the books, yall haven't read them. Opinions are okay to have without needing to justify with logic. This is like all those people pretending to have read 1984 and Brave New World to make poorly reasoned arguments about their twitter getting banned being a sign of the end of free speech as we know it. Just be real with it."
Sherlock,">Even without comparing the two, the character of Sherlock in the show is written in the most stupid way. Instead of being intelligent, observative, and drawing conclusions, he becomes some kind of super-human who pulls conclusions out of thin air.

That's just fundamentally what Sherlock Holmes is, even in the books. This has become a common criticism of the show, that Sherlock is ""basically a magician"", but it's completely consistent with the books. He always made insane leaps of logic to arrive at his conclusions, which invariably ended up being correct.

I think the show was a fantastic modern take on the books up until the third season, when it quickly fell off a cliff. I don't think Sherlock being an insufferable superhuman was ever the problem; that's literally the point of his character."
Sherlock,"I said it elsewhere in the thread but to me the Reichenbach Fall was one of the best episodes of TV I’ve ever seen.

Unfortunately you’re right though, after that it gets bad quickly."
Sherlock,"Truly fantastic television right there. I really began to believe the Moriarty stuff, absolutely wild."
Sherlock,"They alluded that the >!airbag!< theory was the correct one.

But that in itself encapsulates the whole problem with Sherlock.  In a _mystery_ show, you want to be told how the mystery was solved.  You want an explanation that you feel was both reasonable and one you could have reasonably put together yourself if you had asked the right questions or looked at the right details.

Moffett mocked his audience for trying to solve the mystery and then told them they don't get a conclusive answer. The only answer they _do_ get is so stupid and convoluted that it barely passes as an answer at all.  When we point that out (via Anderson) he mocks us for that too."
Sherlock,"The explanation Sherlock gives at the end of the episode is presumed to be the real one. They kinda get ahead of the criticisms by having the characters (Anderson?) point out some holes in it, in both an ironic ""now he finally gets the real solution he doesn't buy it"" and in a meta way of satirising fan criticisms. 

I was generally satisfied with the explanation with one big exception - I dislike the idea that he knew how it would play out the moment he got to the roof. I assumed he came up with the solution on the spot but in hindsight it doesn't make much sense lol"
Sherlock,"I think that's a pretty hot take regarding the meaning of the original stories.

I would say that they are fun self-contained whodunnits with some kooky characters and a bit of gunplay. No social commentary to be found."
Sherlock,What are some examples of the original stories doing this?
Sherlock,"You do realise Sherlock literally shoots VR into the wall of his home?

You know what those letters mean, right?"
Supernatural,"I agree, first 4-5 seasons were excellent. After that, it felt like they needed to keep increasing the intensity and made questionable decisions. This happens to many of these shows. 

The procedurals like Grey's Anatomy, NCIS, etc have it easier."
Supernatural,"I watched every single episode of this series until the end. To me, it started to go downhill the Leviathan season and what they did to my Bobby Singer. I'm loyal, but I'm honest. There were ups and downs after season 5, but truly, the worst thing they could have done was what they did to Bobby. Ingents."
Supernatural,"Yup. But I personally wouldn't have wanted it cancelled at season 5, cause we had some really banger episodes in later seasons (weekend at Bobby's comes to mind)  
 
So now whenever I do rewatches I go straight through 1-5, then start skipping around to the good stuff for the rest"
Supernatural,"The problem with the show in the later seasons is definitely the over reliance on goofy characters. In previous seasons, demons and angels were considered a threat and could be imposing. Then in the later seasons, they become ineffectual comic relief. Every side character becomes a goofy caricature with an over the top accent. The people they meet are cartoons for the most part and the acting is terrible. Sam and Dean also become a bit goofy as well, especially Sam, who’s acting method seems to be simply a large variety of facial ticks and stuttering grunts. Jensen Ackles has too much charisma to be too bad, he’s always watchable but for the most part he becomes a goofy guy as well. The beginning seasons have comedic moments that are pretty good and used sparingly, but they really lean into it in the later seasons and lose all the horror that the early seasons had."
Supernatural,Yes. I truly pretend season 6-15 never existed and just appreciate seasons 1-5 for what they are. It’s a great five season arc.
Supernatural,"I was kind of obsessed at the time, and really worried they would cancell it before the planned ending on season 5. 

Although, looking back, I think the introduction of angels took a lot of the original charm, it was really good TV"
Supernatural,"I definitely grew to miss that really dark aesthetic of the early seasons. I remember a later episode where they're with Rowena rounding up souls in this suburban Canadian neighborhood and it was *so bright* outside. Like distractingly so. 

(It was also one of the few episodes that was very obviously in Canada because the street signs were unlike any I'd seen in the US. But I digress)"
Supernatural,"They jumped so many sharks, they had to reuse sharks."
Supernatural,"The first season is rough. I love it, I have seen it several times, I can watch any episode but the first season is rough. Like Stargate SG-1 it takes time until it becomes a diamond."
Supernatural,"You are correct and there is a clear reason for all of what you said: Kripke only planned the series to be 5 seasons. This is why people call the season 5 finale the “original ending”. But with Supernatural being CW’s most successful show, CW wanted the show to continue. Kripke obliged but he also stepped down as showrunner, and other people took over running the show post season 5. So seasons 6-15 is basically just repetitive season arc’s of fan service, whereas seasons 1-5 had a serialized story that all tied together. The only good thing to come out of seasons 6-15 is >!the confirmation that Chuck is God!<, a lot of fans theorized it before, but if the show had ended after season 5 we never would’ve known for sure."
Supernatural,"It's a good example of how to transition from ""case of the week"" to overarching storyline in a seamless and exciting way. Still a B-show at best for me, but it was fun when I was a teenager! I never continued after season 5."
Supernatural,"With these long-running shows that went downhill in the end it can sometimes be easy to forget there was a time when they were excellent, and that's why they ran long in the first place. Looking at you Arrow."
Supernatural,I hate how they literally wrote in plot armor for them into the series.  It cheapened the whole series.
Supernatural,The series originally was only planned for 5 seasons.
Supernatural,"I always wish it had been cancelled after 5. It would have gone down as a great show, not hokey fan service. And maybe Jared wouldn’t have become so unbearable."
Supernatural,I know people love this show I just don't see it.
Supernatural,"I'm going through Supernatural now for the first time and I'm halfway through season 7 at the moment. I actually think season 6 is a contender for my favourite. Even though it's clear they juggled several plots that they struggled to interconnect, it has several of my favourite episodes of the whole shows, less Sam and Dean conflict (which was played out by that point anyway) and the best part: more Bobby. Bobby is far and away the best character in Supernatural, so having more of him was only a good thing. Season 7 is a noticeable downgrade.

There's a lot of season 1 and 2 that feels very simple, which is to be expected when you're starting a new show and building up a mythology. It's like early episodes of Buffy or The X-Files (and probably a dozen other shows), with the monster of the week format and finding out how to kill them. Kind of like a police procedural but with monsters. When they start to delve into heaven and hell, then I think it starts to hit its stride (Kurt Fuller is great). I'm a lot less interested when it's just constant brother drama.

The problem is that I don't really care about Sam and Dean (*especially* Dean) but some of the side characters are great. So far, I think the episodes and seasons focused on Bobby and Castiel are some of the best ones (which is why I like season 6 so much) and it's disappointing they didn't make the most of Ellen, Jo, Ash, Rufus and more."
Supernatural,"Is it ""extremely good""? Or is it ""extremely good for a CW show""? There's a big difference. I remember this sub telling me *The Arrow* was 'extremely good', which caused all confidence in that channel to be lost."
Supernatural,"More than 10 years since I watched those first 5 seasons and it's still a top favorite of mine.

Somewhere around season 10 was when I stopped watching it weekly. I caught up whenever I had a couple of episodes to binge. After 11 I didn't want to continue anymore. I started a rewatch during that hiatus and I was shocked to finally notice how far the quality had dropped with those later seasons.

After that I came across youtube clips here and there so I have a general idea what the last 4 seasons were like. I did watch the season 15 penultimate episode though and it was just complete garbage. The cgi was so bad the show looked like shit. It looked much better in the earlier seasons. And that was 15 years earlier!

I still watch Kripke's run every other year or so."
Supernatural,Agreed. The story was told by the end of Season 5. Personally I hated the angels and especially Castiel who was played by an extremely bad actor. He was okay in 4 and 5 but anything after that involving him or the angels was tedious to get through. It was so clearly not working anymore that they wrote him out at one point but ended up bringing him back because of the backlash from (I presume) viewers who thought he was hot.  Sam was a bad actor too but the chemistry with Dean helped offset his bad acting even though I think he actually got worse as the show went on. Supernatural was a great show for the first 5 seasons but the other seasons and focus on Castiel tarnished it.
Supernatural,"Yeah, there's a lot of good stories that could be told post-Season 5, but the post-Season 5 we got usually just did the worst possible version of each of those stories. Case in point, how do you go bigger than the devil? You could go with the living embodiment of chaos, the Leviathan. And post-Season 5 of Supernatural did that! ...But it wasn't just the one Leviathan, it was multiple leviathans, and they had nothing to do with the chaos dragon of lore or any sort of leviathan mythos really, instead just being virtually immortal versions of an enemy the brothers have already fought multiple times.

What gets me though is that Kripke was still writing on the show in Season 6. Yes, he was no longer the head writer, but he was still consulting, directly writing a couple of episodes, and was apparently okay with all of the lore inconsistencies and plot holes that Season 6 produced (unless he only had knowledge about the episodes he was working on and not any of the others).

Because of that and the low points of the Carver era, I think I would still be skeptical of a post-S5 new Kripke era even though those first five seasons were amazing."
Supernatural,"While I agree that 1-5 amazing, there were a few standalone seasons that were also very good. I think it's season 11 where they are trying to stop Gods sister, and that was a banger. A redeemed Metatron trying to convince Chuck not to give up on humanity is peak Supernatural.

Of course, then they completely ruin that excellence with the plot twist involving God in the last season.

I think the show had two perfect series finales, S5 and S11. The actual finale got ruined by COVID, so I'd cut them some slack if the rest of the season wasn't terrible."
Supernatural,"Money is a helluva drug. 

I pretty much tell anyone interested in the show “watch seasons 1 through 5, pause the last episode of season 5 at the end right when the camera is outside of the house, and pretend that’s where the series ended and 6-15 aren’t real.”"
Supernatural,Is it just me who feels supernatural and Smallville are bizarrely similar in later seasons??
Supernatural,"I would hardly call ""extremely good"", it was alright

the show was always B tier/CW silliness, especially after season 1"
Supernatural,"Extremely good?  I mean come on.  They are OK.  Its a good thing to have on in the background while you're doing something else.  Its B level quantity over quality television, which is fine.  There's nothing really outstanding about it.  Its entertaining enough, but the writing, acting, cinematography, are all pretty meh."
Supernatural,"It's difficult to recommend people to just watch 5 seasons out of a 15 season show on good faith. Yet new people will get a bit afraid seeing a 15 season show to pick up, specially one with so many episodes.

Loved those first 5 seasons and the whole 15 were good overall but gee, makes it difficult to recommend the show."
Supernatural,"It's actually 2 - 5.  Originally, the brothers weren't meant to continue.  It was going to be a anthology series at first. Their chemistry on screen is what made them stop telling a story about the world with these characters in it, and more about these characters interacting with the world.  Also the budget significantly increases in the second season.  If you watch the end of Season 1, it ends with a car crash with generic ass music playing on the radio.  Season 2 starts and its playing a licensed Ted Nugent song."
Supernatural,"It's a good YA show, but it doesn't hold up against other top TV shows. 

Swap Jensen Ackles and Jared Padalecki out for less attractive leads and the show loses a large portion of its female fanbase."
Supernatural,Wasn't Ben Edlund responsible for the show's uptick (ha!) In quality on seasons 2-5?
Supernatural,"There are a lot of good episodes in seasons 1-2, but I’ve always felt like the writers strike forcing a shorter season 3 was hugely beneficial. Made them cut out any filler and focus more on the larger plot.

Season 3 also gave us Ghostfacers, so on that alone it’s my favorite."
Supernatural,"Some good with a lot of meh is a perfect description of the seasons post Lucifer prophecy aka season 6 and onward. I honestly enjoy the over arcing narratives of each season, but wow are there a lot of 'skip' moments in each season/episode. Basically any time Sam and Dean start arguing and then later make up became instant skip scenes. At that point they served no narrative purpose beyond starting and episode with drama and ending the episode with a flimsy disagreement conclusion that set them back to their basic positions. 


As a side note, im still annoyed with how they built up Eve, made super monsters, and then just brushed it all away in about 5 minutes of scene time.


While I personally didnt like the final confrontation, I was fine with the finale/ send-off. But yes the first 5 seasons are quite good and season 5 is one that I occasionally go back to and watch again. Mark Pellegrino was a fantastic Lucifer for the earlier seasons."
Supernatural,I think there was a drop in quality after Eric Kripke left the show
Supernatural,"Just finished a full series rewatch myself and I was thinking the same thing about the back ten seasons, but at the same time I really respect them just for going for it yknow?

A lot of people say they hated the Leviathans but honestly that whole ""arc"" for lack of a better term is probably my favorite just because it was amazing to me that they actually managed to find a new villain after the massive shark jump that was lucifer

And although it started to get stale after awhile everytime they managed to pull a new bad guy out of their asses I was honestly floored

Like when Dean massacred the house of frankstein that was pretty dumb, and when there was that one episode about the monster families that run Chicago that never came up again, I was rolling my eyes at that pretty hard but just the charm of jumping the shark and then finding a larger shark to jump over never wore off on me"
Supernatural,"I put the writing of 1-5 of supernatural against any TV show, and it holds up.

I look at it as 6-15 is just a different show. 1-5 takes itself reasonably seriously, 6-15 is fun popcorn television."
Supernatural,"I think the only season I skipped in full was season 10. My least favourite choice in the show will always be the dragon copout, too."
Supernatural,"First 2 seasons were close to x-files ""monster of the week"". Then when we got close to the characters they added epic story."
Supernatural,End last ep of season 5 as it starts to pan away from Dean having a meal with his adopted family and it's perfect.
Supernatural,Dean telling Sam what he did while he was in hell is one of the best scenes in TV
Supernatural,"Agreed... and disagreed. As much as I love SPN season 1-5, I wouldn't say I like how the female characters in it were written. Save Bela. Bela was fucking awesome.

Then again I also don't like how the female characters are written in 6-15 so... Yeah, I really don't know how to feel about the whole show regarding that."
Supernatural,"I do agree season 1-5 are the best the show has I really liked season 6-11 and imo season 11 works as a series finale too.

12-15 while weaker I still liked them I thought god as the villian was cool but he didn't really do much in season 15 the whole bringing back old creatures was dealt with swiftly.

granted God being evil was abit left field 

the show finale while not the best I still enjoyed it"
Supernatural,"Yeah Power creep, they beat the devil so the next baddie has to be more powerful, and then the next one, etc.

I still enjoy the later seasons for the monster-of-the-week episodes but almost all of the plotlines are weak."
Supernatural,"I used to go on the subreddit and speculate how certain seasons would wind up, and I was always wrong because they would just keep getting more and more ridiculous and then a bigger enemy would emerge in the last episode and one of the brothers would disappear. That show had so much potential for good stories but it became fanservice schlock."
Supernatural,"Near the end of the leviathan stuff is when I stopped, good to know I didn't miss out on anything."
Supernatural,And then they brought Bobby back! Not the same Bobby but still! I’m guessing they got a lot of backlash killing Bobby off (and the way they did it) and found a way to bring him back and thought everything would be square lol
Supernatural,"''The French Mistake'', ''Baby'' and ''ScoobyNatural''. Fantastic episodes."
Supernatural,Seasons 1-5 are the Winchester Gospel. Seasons 6-15 are the apocrypha.
Supernatural,"I actually didn't finish season 15. I got halfway through and gave up when I heard the ending had been horrible. I read the synopsis of the remaining episodes and it was just a weird way to end it. Having rewatched 1-5, it makes way more sense to stop there and pretend it actually ended there."
Supernatural,And one episode was called jump the shark.
Supernatural,"The problem with season one on streaming is that it’s the only season without the original music used in the show. So you’ll have moments of Dean rocking out to a rock song, but it’s the not the song that was originally in the show so they have to edit it weird."
Supernatural,"After a quick scroll on IMDB i'll give you Bloody Mary, Hook Man, Bugs and Route 666 but I think the rest are watchable to great, even something like The Benders sets up the trope of human enemies always being gross bastards. 18 outta 22 ain't bad."
Supernatural,Yeah it took a while for them to figure out the right balance of monster of the week with serialized story. As a whole it's good but you can pick it apart pretty easily episode by episode and ultimately the monster of the week stuff just falls short. The real redeeming factor of the show was that serialized story and you sat through the monster of the week to see the weekly 5 minutes of progression for the overarching plot.
Supernatural,"We went to a Supernatural fan panel at a convention. It was our first con and we thought it would be fun. I forget how my husband ended up with the mic, but he said, well we all know Chuck is God. 

Holy crap was the response not what I expected. Half the room cheered in agreement, the other half grumbled and there were a few boos. One of the panelists wanted to know what led him to believe that. It was obvious she disagreed, and a guy in the audience went on about how how was a Christian and Chuck being God would be disrespectful to Christianity. All I could think was, do you even watch the show?

It was realty wild to see so many people refuse to believe it, and then the big reveal happened. I really liked Chuck being God. Everything after with his character was uneven to downright disappointing."
Supernatural,The powerhouse they had at Thursday night I believe with Smallville leading into Supernatural made them a ton of money. It’s not surprising they would milk it even after the creators were out of story.
Supernatural,"And that is why they were the best seasons. Still one of the greatest shows in years in terms of music and art direction. 

I get so angry about the Sera Gamble seasons. Big bad talked about in first couple episodes then forgotten and defeated in the last 1-2 episodes. 

Carver wasn't too bad. 

I popped back for the Men of Letters season when Mary was brought back.

Edit to add: I feel bad for everyone who watched it later via streaming after the original music was stripped out. The classic rock used went with the story in most cases and when it was switched it didn't feel the same. I can only watch it on bluray at this point otherwise there is much rage."
Supernatural,"Honestly i disagree. While it obviously went downhill after season 5 we still got some amazing and fun episodes along the way up to season 15 that we would have missed. Like my all time favorite one ""The French Mistake"" in season 6. Just that episode alone makes Season 6 worth watching."
Supernatural,"Extremely good for a network TV show, not just CW. If you have issues with network TV, those issues are still present. If you don't, it's a fantastic time."
Supernatural,"You have a point, but I personally think it's just a solid show for any network (specifically season 1-5). There is a super cringe part of the fandom that overlaps with The Arrow fans that think that stuff was good. I gave The Arrow a shot after hearing the accolades and it was the most meh piece of TV. The latter years of SPN catered extremely hard to these cringe fans (where the early seasons actually made fun of them). I honestly think Twitter/Tumbler fandoms have ruined many shows because a show gets popular so creators turn to the internet to see what the fans are saying and the most hardcore ones are living there creating the absolute dumbest piece of fanfic possible with everyone praising it. 

The WB/CW was a good melodrama network for teens and young adults and then it turned into PG13 Nickelodeon shows."
Supernatural,"I think post-5 Kripke was collecting checks and helping the team transition without him. I mean they literally kill him in one episode. After that, he seemed to just get residuals and drop in every now and then. The writing was just terrible after he left though. I know he didn't personally write that many episodes in 1-5, but his showrunning direction must have been what kept things grounded and on a consistent course. 

He seems to be running the Boys like he did SPN and I think that's making people anxious. A big criticism of The Boys season 3 is that it ended just like it started and nothing really changed, just a lot of build up for nothing. To me that's exactly what happened in season 3 of SPN with Dean actually dying and going to hell. He seems to still write like he would for a network TV show instead of a streaming service, and he's said that he's planning to go to season 5 with the Boys. I think he's got good ideas and knows how to string stories along to keep them interesting until they can reach a final episode and come to a conclusion. I'd bet he'd be able to develop a well rounded epilogue to season 5 SPN if he got the chance."
Supernatural,"For me the only stand-out late season was 12, when the villains went from being angels and demons to just… the English. Such a weird choice but I enjoyed the change."
Supernatural,1000%
Supernatural,Probably cuz they reuse the same local Canadian actors.
Supernatural,"You gotta treat it like I did Arrow. It was a shame they canceled it after 2 seasons. I still have such rage over black canary in s3e1.

It's such a shame SPN got canceled after 5 seasons."
Supernatural,"You just have to explain to the people that you're recommending the show to that it's not really a 15 season show. It's more like a 5 season show with a 6 season sequel show which has its own 4 season sequel show. And the sequel shows just retained the title of the original show. But you can jump off at the end of Season 5, the end of Season 11, or the end of Season 15 and still get a full story."
Supernatural,I wouldn't call Bad Moon Rising by CCR generic ass music.
Supernatural,"I think the anthology series was an idea that got dropped before the pilot even shot. Kripke wanted the scary stories to be front and center with a couple of reporters going around capturing them, but when the studio disliked that he pitched the idea of them being brothers. I think he fleshed out a couple seasons at a time, waiting to see if they would be able to continue before writing any cliffhangers."
Supernatural,"Maybe. I followed Padiwhack over from Gilmore Girls. Mainly, I was there for the monster of the week with the supernatural twists. Horror is my bread and butter. 

Even better was the classic rock music. So much good music in those early seasons."
Supernatural,"Yea, and he stayed until season 8 but I think he worked better with Kripke there than when he wasn't."
Supernatural,"OMFG, I swear it's because Sera Gamble forgot who her big bad for that season was. So much potential just forgotten."
Supernatural,"I've never really understood this criticism about the female characters. I understand that many times there was a ""damsel in distress"" type character week to week that Dean usually hit on (especially in the early episodes), but they never seemed purposefully written to be a bad stereotype and his advances were usually batted down and he was made to look like a fool.

Jo and Ellen showed up early in the series and appeared a number of times. Each time they held their own against the bad guys and all of the male characters seemed to respect them.

Ruby and Meg were both demons and did demon things and it never seemed like they were written poorly (just maybe acted poorly at times).

Sheriff Jody Mills helps defeat the bad guy after her family was killed.

Bela was well written and beat the guys quite a bit.

These were all season 5 and earlier characters. I think the overall issue is that there wasn't a prominent female character that lasted a long time. Most of them showed up every now and then, but not like Bobby, Crowley, and Castiel who were often in episode after episode. There's only so much room for the regular cast and they'd already settled into a very male-centric show. Two brothers + dad, then two brothers + Bobby, then two brothers + Bobby and a male angel, then two brothers + Bobby and a male angel and a male demon. They seemed to try to rectify this with Rowena and Mary later on, but those episodes were already meh. The crux of the matter is that the show started off as very hetero-focused with Dean being a womanizer. So any woman that was introduced was already being ogled at by one of the main characters. Dean even sleeps with an angel in one episode and Sam sleeps with a werewolf in another episode. The early seasons had women showing up who would eventually swoon for the main characters, except for the ones I listed above. So I think instead of bucking that trend, they just didn't put effort into casting a series regular woman in any role."
Supernatural,"I loved the series throughout the entire run, but the power creep was pretty hilarious.

They kill literal death, and eventually they kill the actual omniscient omnipresent God, despite having no actual powers. 

Puts DBZ to shame."
Supernatural,"Until eventually they literally killed Death, Lucifer, and even God. It got pretty silly (I still enjoyed the later seasons, but I also know they were ridiculous and not as good as the beginning)"
Supernatural,"The extremely meta ""The French Mistake"" in Season 6 is one of the best episodes of a show taking the piss out of its actors, storylines, and fans. There's a reason those gifs are still used today."
Supernatural,"Yeah, that's when I called it quits as well. The leviathans were hyped up so much, then were completely depowered by the end of the season. The first red flag was when they pulled that same shit with Castiel already."
Supernatural,Just think; that's about half way through the series. Woof.
Supernatural,"The single thing I recommend going back for is the Scooby-Doo crossover because it's a standalone.

No, seriously."
Supernatural,"So much rage over what they did to Bobby.

Flames! Flames on the side of my face!"
Supernatural,"I used to show friends who weren’t sure if they’d like the show 3 episodes: Mystery Spot, Ghostfacers, and French Mistake. Always a big hit."
Supernatural,This is perfect. Love it.
Supernatural,The season 5 ending is the highest rated episodes of the show. The season 15 one is the 3rd lowest out of all the 327 episodes lol.
Supernatural,"I watched season 6, eventually. My husband watched every episode. Occasionally he would have me watch episodes that I would 'love' and he was mostly right - if I treated it like fan fiction and not canon. Scoobynatural was HIGHLY entertaining."
Supernatural,I cried during the last episode. It seemed like the perfect sendoff to me. YMMV
Supernatural,Bugs was the very first episode I watched haha
Supernatural,Rob Benedict confirmed that Chuck is God back in 2011 at a convention. He even said that Kripke and other writers/producers asked him how it felt to play God.
Supernatural,"Season 11 had Metatron call Chuck God's meatsuit and that the nebbishness of his personality belonged to Chuck, not God. To me that leaves the door open to either interpretation.

Either:

1) At the beginning of time God knew how everything in the future would play out, knew when the apocalypse would be triggered, and created his angels with the name of a ""prophet"" on the inside of their eyelids that he always knew he would disguise himself as one day. Then when it came time for that ""prophet"" to be born, he paused the prophet-creation mechanic so that no new prophet would be born during Chuck's lifetime, blinded the archangel who was assigned to watch Chuck so that he wouldn't see that God was letting himself be born as Chuck (or came into being as an adult Chuck and simply rewrote Raphael's memories so that he didn't realize he never watched Chuck being born and growing up). And then he pretended to have headaches to pass himself off as a prophet. Then after Raphael had died, he continued pretending to have headaches when no one was around to see him simply because he had gotten that into the character of Chuck. He then left Earth for a while and restarted the prophet-creation mechanic. Then he returned to Earth, had sex with some of his creations that he considers his children, eventually talked to Metatron, and through his conversation with Metatron decided that he wanted to be a writer who told the truth. So he helped the brothers defeat Amara (but possibly lied about Gabriel's death), and then left Earth with her for a while. Then he came back to Earth and decided he instead wanted to be a writer who lies in order to be the best writer of all time. He cooked up ways to torture the brothers, but even though he was able to foresee the apocalypse at the beginning of time, he couldn't foresee the brothers' plans to defeat him. And then the brothers left him alive even though he still has all of his knowledge of magic and powered-artifacts that would let him return as a threat in the future.

or

2) Chuck was an actual human prophet that was born to human parents. His name was written on the inside of the angels' eyelids from the beginning of time. He helped the brothers, and in the Season 5 finale God began using him as a vessel. God began taking on Chuck's memories as his own and pretending that Chuck's experiences were his experiences. When Metatron confronted him about this charade, he led God to the conclusion that he didn't want to be Chuck anymore, he wanted to be a writer who told the truth. So he helped the brothers defeat Amara and then merged with her at the end of Season 11. God's light softened Amara, allowing her to appreciate creation, but Amara's darkness corrupted Chuck, feeding his ego and narcissism, and allowed Chuck to gain control of God and his powers. So now instead of God pretending to be Chuck, it was Chuck pretending to be God. And Chuck had no qualms about being a writer who lies if it meant he would be recognized as the greatest writer ever. But because Chuck isn't God, he didn't have full access to all of God's powers. He wasn't able to see how the brothers would defeat him. And once he was defeated, he didn't have God's knowledge of magic or artifacts that would allow him to become a threat to the brothers ever again.

Personally I think the second option makes more sense and gives the story a better conclusion, but I think people are welcome to go with the first interpretation if they choose.

That said, Kripke confirmed that Chuck wasn't always planned to be God. They were still trying to figure out how they wanted to portray God when they were writing the back half of Season 5, and Kripke confirmed that God hadn't appeared in the show yet at that time even though Chuck had appeared in Season 4 and three episodes of Season 5."
Supernatural,"Oh the catering to fans really killed Arrow for me. I ended up tapping out. 

And yeah. Becky hilarious.  The musical lame."
Supernatural,I think this might be why. Thanks!
Supernatural,"For streaming, they swapped it with Backwater Rising by Tom Coerver.

Supernatural,"Okay, I don't know about you but I feel like you and I watched 2 different shows. Spoileeeers.

>Jo and Ellen showed up early in the series and appeared a number of times. Each time they held their own against the bad guys and all of the male characters seemed to respect them.


In what sort of ways do you say they held their own?

Jo's first appearance was good but she didn't face off against any bad guys. Jo's second appearance had her kidnapped before Dean and Sam save her. Then she agrees to use herself as bait while the our two heroes trap him in a ring of salt. Third appearance has Meg tie her up and continually harrass her before Dean saves her. The only thing she does in the episode is save him from drowning but that's about it. Fourth appearance has War making her think a demon entered her mother and finally, she shows some combat skills, but she doesn't end up using them against any bad guys. 

And finally, fifth appearance has her finally showing that she's all grown by... once again using herself as bait and Sam and Dean go to steal the colt back from Crowley. Now, she does end up saving Dean but she never manages to kill either of those two dogs, her mother did. She may have been the one who gave the idea of having them blow up the shop while Sam and Dean leave but that's way too late and it was while on her deathbed.

Jo's whole arc is that she wants her mother to see her as a full fledged hunter. As someone who can take care of herself without her mother needing to babying her. But we don't get any sort of acknowledgment from her.

Ellen isn't any better. Good first appearance but no bad guys. Second appearance has her decide to go with Bobby, Sam and Dean before Jake Tally decides to use her as a hostage make her turn her gun to her head. She's does end up helping Bobby close the gate of hell but that's about all she does in that episode. Third appeareance has her being held down by her own daughter and after she managed to overpower her, she runs back to storage and leaves Sam with Jo and Rufus.

 And then there's her final episode. She may have been the one to take out the dogs but it was too late.

>Ruby and Meg were both demons and did demon things and it never seemed like they were written poorly (just maybe acted poorly at times).

 I'm not so sure about that. Yes, they were fine. But when you compare them to someone like Crowley, especially Ruby, it becomes clear that they only had one goal in mind. They never seemed to be fleshed out like he was.

Meg 1 and Meg 2 were fine.

Speaking of the demoness(es?), one thing I've noticed is that whenever a(male) demon is shown to be tortured, that almost always have their clothes on and mostly shown bloody and beaten. However, when Ruby is held by Alastair, she is shown naked with only a metal bar covering her nipples, much is the same way with Meg.

Jody and Bella were fine, I guess.

Female (recurring) characters you have mentioned from kripke era:

>Becky

A caricature of an obsessive fangirl. There's nothing nice to say about her.

>Anna

Man, did she get shafted soooo badly. I'm fully well aware of her potential and that her role was taken by Castiel because he was the fan's favorite but if there's any female character that was poorly written, it's her.

There was a post on SPN subreddit that explained what was wrong with what they had done to her. Here it is.

https://www.reddit.com/r/Supernatural/comments/101mfyo/anna_was_done_so_wrong_on_this_show/

>Lisa

She is there to primarily suit Dean's needs after what happened to Sam. As opposed to all the other love interests, she is not fleshed out well enough. Main thing out her is that she has a son named Ben, who's probably Dean's, had a one night stand with Dean and that's about it. Heck, we're supposed to believe he fell in love with her but we barely know anything about her. 

I don't mind having love interests but the fact that they're there primarily to suit them, never having their own arcs and struggles and even if they did, they just  aren't as complex as the other recurring characters were at when they were at season 5(Cas to Anna, Crowley to Ruby and Meg).

And that would leave us with 1 good female character, 3 evil female characters. Of all those four, only one of them lived on and it wasn't a love interest. 

That's my problem. Love interests are shown from the first episode to either die from being involved with the Winchesters(John to Mary, Sam to Madison and Jessica and Dean to Anna(although that was more of Castiel's fault))

And if you want a much more egregious example look no further further the finale, Sam's love interest is never shown her face. The mother of his children shown out of the shot because... uhhh
Ummm..."

Supernatural,"It's so hammy and campy it's incredible imo. I loved when the show was more ""grounded"" but I equally love it for going so hard off the rails while being self aware and REALLY committing to it. 

What other show has done that?"
Supernatural,">!And the end was a slap on the face - to have plot armor throughout the series to die a stupid death to a usual monster. Yeah, I know the meta story, but the point is, deaths are cheap stake - which is why action genre is considered low, whereas other stakes are harder to develop and pay off. And to use sudden character death in the last episode is terribly cheap!<"
Supernatural,I liked how they depowered them in the last episode or 2 of  season15 but it felt like that could have come way earlier in the show to get them back to fighting more normal monsters.
Supernatural,"Yes, but can the brothers defeat a nail in a wall?"
Supernatural,"Hey, they were super powerful with a devastating weakness for … common household cleaners."
Supernatural,Hey it’s Tuesday! Pig’n’poke!
Supernatural,Yellow fever along with those 3 are some of my favorites
Supernatural,"That's ridiculous, lol. Can you imagine a world where seasons 6-15 didn't exist? With SPN having ended 13 years ago and just been one of those shows that faded into maybe cult classic like status? Going out on the highest rated episode of the series would have been great and people probably would have been discussing a potential continuation for the past 13 years. That's when you get them back together and you pick up with a limited new story and the whole point is to finally get Sam out of hell. Instead, they brought him back before the episode ended."
Supernatural,"And you didn’t quit there and then? I don’t think I would have been so strong, that episode is ROUGH."
Supernatural,"Rob Benedict would say at conventions that he thought Chuck was God but he never said yes or no for sure.

The convention I'm talking about was in 2013"

Skins,Are any of the actors as hot as Kaya Scodelario?
Skins,"I just finished it, definitely warmed to it with each episode. I was quite pleasantly surprised that there was a ""sexual awakening"" storyline, but with no drama or inner turmoil... it was just fine."
Skins,Kaya was like 14/15 when she started skins ...
Skins,lol you'd be watching for the wrong reasons. ^but ^if ^i'm ^being ^honest... ^no.
Skins,"Given the audience it's aimed at, a lot of people were probably that age when they were watching. reddit is young. Some people reading this right now are probably still that age. Not everyone watched the show as it aired.

She was on the show though after she was no longer underage."
Skins,I thought season 4 was the last season.
Skins,"I really enjoyed Sex Education.

I'd prefer they stop on a high note in season 4 rather than force out more seasons. 

Coordinating the cast's (now busy) schedules is really hard, so more seasons will likely require doing a huge recast"
Skins,Spoiler alert: season 4 ends with Eric leaving in a blue police call box.
Skins,"Feels like S4 is shaping up to be its last. Obviously could technically still keep going i guess, but can't think of any show that lost so many key characters and still managed to still be at the same quality."
Skins,"Well damn, I guess her and Otis ain’t getting together after all."
Skins,If they are continuing it past season 4. They should just do a spin off. Otis can be a side character maybe but follow someone new. I think that would be better than continuing Otis’ storyline with Emma or Ncuti. Just give the audience a good ending for them and continue with someone else.
Skins,Otis isn’t gonna have any friends left
Skins,Ruby redeemed?
Skins,"otis back to ruby pls🙏🏻 i still see that “i love you” scene and get butterflies, idk why but its so genuine, maybe im a touchy dumbass tho"
Skins,"High school tv shows are not supposed to go past 4 seasons. You either pull a Smallville off and have the entire show completely change in order to expand and fit the adulthood of its characters, with full on jobs, big city life and more mature storylines like matrimony and so on, or you just stop when they graduate, like the horrible 13 Reasons Why."
Skins,".....well why the fuck would I watch it, then?

Unless this is a joke about there being no season 5 anyway."
Skins,"I love the show. However, I'll be shocked if it gets a season 5"
Skins,"After winning the BAFTA for Rising Star, she’s probably set up for some major projects, that award has an big hit rate for its winners."
Skins,I can't imagine we see a s5
Skins,"""And that's when I finally knew I was educated about sex."" 

THE END"
Skins,So you’re telling me she’s NOT Gillian Jacobs/Margot Robbie?
Skins,It’s time for that show to end anyway. No show about high school should last longer than four years
Skins,Well it seems I will stop watching after season 4
Skins,We’re leaving
Skins,"I mean, they could end the series, it's not good or funny anymore anyway."
Skins,Don't make this like Boy Meets World:The College Years.
Skins,Series 3 was terrible so it should have ended anyway
Skins,This show is basically porn. I have kids and think this show needs to end. Seriously every season they make of this show I end up having another kid with my wife because you put on some porn and one thing leads to another. For the sake of my bank account quit making this show!
Skins,"Outside of them doing a Skins and a full recast, no reason the show should go past season 4. They should be graduating soon and probably the entire cast wants to move on."
Skins,"She reminds me of Margit Robbie so much

It will be a good final season"
Skins,S1-S2 I loved. I couldn’t get past the first couple episodes of S3 — some of the worst TV I have ever watched.
Skins,Finally! The shipping of her and Otis is finally over. I swear it is as bad as Friends.
Skins,Yes this was made aware a few days ago at least
Skins,"kill it already, nobody cares anymore. its been ages and half of cast left."
Skins,I never finished season three since the actors were far too old for their roles.  Season 5 would have them in wheelchairs.
Skins,See you on the “Actors who left parts and didn’t go anywhere” list in a few years.
Skins,One of the worst shows ever made
Skins,No!
Skins,"Makes sense, her career is really blowing up right now."
Skins,"I thought everyone was leaving... I don't even watch the show and I knew it was supposed to be over. I read it on one of those ""tv shows being renewed/cancelled"" lists, lol"
Skins,Bring on a new cast and setting like in Skins.
Skins,I thought it was the finale also. Most of the main characters are moving on. And there isn’t much of a story left.
Skins,"I hope it doesn't become the new elite, which will go on forever until it becomes trash..."
Skins,prob should be since ncuti gatwa is leaving too.
Skins,"Even if it wasn't planned, the last season made me tired of the ""Oh no, will the two characters who the writers obviously want to get together get together, but there's now this NEW obstacle! And lack of communication!"" thing that has been going on for the last few season. Like, season 1, OK, that's fine. Season 2 it started feeling old. Season 3 and I felt like ""Get on with it."""
Skins,"Well in that case, she’s definitely leaving after season 4"
Skins,Season 2 should’ve been.
Skins,"Yeah for example Ncuti Gatwa has been filming the fourth season, and starting on Doctor Who at the same time. From set photos it seems that he's been going back and forth between the two. That's something I imagine is only short term while he finishes up on Sex Ed, as it must be a nightmare for both shows to align their schedules with each other, particularly as he's the main character of one."
Skins,"That’s the thing with Netflix they either stretch out a successful series to the point it barely makes sense anymore or they just cut it short without mercy. 

There’s very few exceptions to this rule as BCS or Dark."
Skins,I liked season one and watched a lot of season 2. At a certain point it just felt like EVERYTHING in the show has to revolve around sex. Like I get that's the premise of the show to an extent but it just gets exhausting. Sex is great and all and it's fun to talk about but it's not all encompassing as an adult.
Skins,That would be a good little easter egg if the last time we see him is entering a police call box to make a phone call or something
Skins,Friday Night Lights after season 3?
Skins,Mackey leaving and probably Ncuti was well considering he’s the new Doctor Who.. focusing on a good ending with season 4 seems the best idea.
Skins,Degrassi shows it can be done but it gets messy. So many characters had to repeat grades just so they could keep them around
Skins,JUSTICE for Ruby
Skins,They’re going to f**k for 9 episodes straight next season. The End.
Skins,What do you thing season 4 is about?? They’ll always be the main couple in the show. That’s the whole show.
Skins,[deleted]
Skins,Their chemistry was amazing and their scenes were better written then Maeve and Otis which lost it's heat after season 1.
Skins,We are all suckers for moments like those
Skins,"Buffy somehow pulled it off although it did go downhill a bit after graduation.  That said, my two favorite episodes (Hush, Once More With Feeling) were both post highschool."
Skins,"Yeah One Tree hill had this massively , the first few seasons were fun teen drama 

season 5 jumped like 5 years and they were all in jobs and it was god awful shit"
Skins,this made no sense until I realized you are thinking US. High School in UK is 2-3 years ending with A levels
Skins,"I agree. Love everything we've gotten so far, but really feel the story should end while it's still good."
Skins,"Yea I recently watch it through.  Love it, but definitely no need to add on seasons to make it stale. And I thought I had read that season 4 was the last season, but mayhe I imagined that."
Skins,You're correct. She's not two different people.
Skins,"For the entirety of the movie until the credits rolled at the end, I 100% thought that was Margot Robbie in Death on the Nile."
Skins,"""Fuck this ship!"""
Skins,Lolz
Skins,You seem to care though.
Skins,lol appreciate the different point of view i guess
Skins,Honestly could have just wrapped it after 3. Maeve in America is kinda a dumb plotline
Skins,"Maybe they're going for various ""generations""."
Skins,Money
Skins,I'd prefer they stop on a high note in season 4 rather than force out more seasons.
Skins,They’re also like 35 year olds playing 17 year olds.
Skins,">Most of the main characters are moving on.

Moving on to do what?"
Skins,Elite was trash after season 1.
Skins,It already has.
Skins,I've heard that all the protagonists from season 1 are gone
Skins,For Doctor Who?
Skins,i only saw season 1
Skins,">BCS

That is only if we all decide to pretend that Better Call Saul is a Netflix show"
Skins,I still can't believe Kim was part of Sic Mundus and she was actually a grown up Kaylee Ehrmantraut.
Skins,I really enjoyed the latest season of Stranger Things and think it came close to the magic of the first season.
Skins,What shows to they stretch on too long? They don’t have that money super long running shows
Skins,Stranger Things and Narcos are exceptions too imo.
Skins,Voltron and Dragon prince were like thatVoltron was about to get good and hit all the notes but got cut back and dragon prince I would say should have ended in season 3.
Skins,"BoJack comes to mind. Was at the forefront of the morose cynical comedies, got a lot of praise and viewership, and just lost the plot and ran the show into the ground… fizzling off with no fanfare."
Skins,And then he turns to the audience and gives a little wink while saying hi the doctor will see you now while David Tennant dances in the background. Fun Easter egg
Skins,Just got to luck into finding a Michael B Jordan
Skins,"The thing with *FNL* was it still had Kyle Chandler to serve as a constant through line for the changing students which made sense. All of the new cast was involved with him to some degree. They also still had a good portion of the original cast - Taylor Kitsch, Jesse Plemons, Zach Gilford, etc.

With *Sex Education*, you really only have Groff serving in a similar capacity, and I don't think he really works the same way as he barely has a good relationship with any of the students (including his son). And the other teachers are sort of side characters. 

Gillian Anderson could make the most sense to step into this kind of role (and I suppose they still could), except her involvement in the school and students has been fairly sporadic.

Not that they can't try to bring in a new slate of students (and they've already added and subtracted some from the cast), but I don't think they could do it as seemlessly with so many of the students either gone in Season 3 or presumably leaving after the upcoming season."
Skins,"And with Mackey and Ncuti leaving, it certainly gives Wood (Aimee) and Swindells (Adam) a lot less to do since their storylines are usually fairly tightly tied to theirs. Perhaps I'll be proven wrong, but Aimee without Maeve and Adam without Eric don't seem much worth following in a Season 5."
Skins,Ncuti is confirmed to be leaving too.
Skins,Ruined the best damn relationship in the entire show
Skins,fuck
Skins,I'd watch it: True Sex Education ;p
Skins,fuck
Skins,"dude i remember watching that particular episode where they had a fucking blast together as pick me up tv like the office and shit. that relationship just worked and it felt nice, now emma and otis were great at first as well but the second him and ruby got together it was just nicer"

Spartacus,"Jupiter's cock, we're all Spartacus!"
Spartacus,"As a huge Spartacus fan I was pulled in by the previews because I love history and a good period piece. When I started watching it I stayed for the ridiculously awesome dialogue (“my cock rages on!”), the acting and story were on point, and the beautiful women that were naked 90% of the time. It also motivates me to work out a lot ."
Spartacus,"It was coming off the heels of 300, which was a cultural sensation for a bit, so the target audience was anyone who liked that movie. That's also why the pilot looks aesthetically similar. It was a good investment by the studio for seeing a market for those kinds of set pieces, but it was better that it developed its own style instead of being a rip-off of a rather unique piece of cinema."
Spartacus,"I am the target audience

I am Spartacus"
Spartacus,Target Audiance is those that like naked bodies and sword fights.... in that order.
Spartacus,"I loved that series based only on the weird and fresh dialogue.

""Pull tongue from ass and speak your mind!"" 

""Jupiter's cock!""

""The shadow of Rome is vast, and you, Thracian, will die under it."""
Spartacus,"It had a lotta bit for everybody.  Viva Bianca and Lucy Lawless were smokin' friggin hot.  I'm not into dudes, but if you are, you got plenty of fanservice. Batiatus was funny as hell.  I thought the actor who played Ashur did a great job of both making me hate him and sometimes sympathize for him (if I remember correctly). Oenomaus was badass.  The action was well done, and brutal AF.  The main cast of homies had good chemistry, both the men and women.  And I wanted painful deaths for most of the antagonists.  

RIP to Andy Whitfield, who did an awesome Job in S1.  And hats off to Dustin Clare who played Gannicus for S2+, and Liam McIntyre for picking up the role of Spartacus in S3+ and doing it great justice.  

Not a masterpiece, but pretty damned good and worth watching all the way through.  I'll always think back on it fondly"
Spartacus,Me who just wanted to see Xena fuck.
Spartacus,I am the target audience of Spartacus
Spartacus,"it's got badassery, beautiful nude male bodies, beautiful nude female bodies, giant dicks and beautiful pussies so:

gay men, straight women, straight men and gay women, I'd say between 16 and 50"
Spartacus,"I loved it because it was based on history, albeit losely and had some of the most beautiful pairs of titties I've ever seen. I knew a couple girls who loved the show too so guess it appealed to both genders."
Spartacus,"Joey, do you like movies about gladiators?"
Spartacus,"People who watched 300 and thought it was just a touch too subtle and understated, everyone who watched Xena and wondered what the lead had under her armor, people who thought Game of Thrones was ""too boring,"" and fans of realistic classical swearing.

Spartacus,"As a nearly 35-year-old woman with the mentality of a 14-year-old boy, you're both right."

Spartacus,"This is going to be something of an anecdotal answer, but when I lived in Washington DC there was a neighborhood bar that catered towards younger black men, and they would show that show every single week. They loved it. If you talked during the show, you'd be shushed harshly.

I asked the bartender what the deal was, and his answer was simple: ""It's a show about white dudes fucking up and killing other white dudes. That's just great."""
Spartacus,Fans of Jupiter’s Cock
Spartacus,"First watched the show as a teen on public TV channel, and it was censored af so my family thought it was like a badly edited historical drama? 

I rewatched in my 20s online and by Jupiter's cock, the dialogue was some shit and it had some of the best swinger scenes in TV history"
Spartacus,That’s hilarious bc I watched it when I was 14/15 old teenaged boy. Lucy lawless was a key person during puberty for me haha.
Spartacus,"Watched it in my 20s, fan of classical history. It was one of the most fun shows ever. When every episode came out you knew it was going to be a blast. The nudity was there, but it's one of the most fun I've had with a series ever.

I loved the dialogs so much I started learning some Latin because of it."
Spartacus,"Anyone who isn’t a prude really, it was just a lot of fun."

Spartacus,Me.  Big RIP Andy Whitfield.
Spartacus,I do not remember this colorful dialogue in Kubrick’s 1960 epic starring Kirk Douglas…
Spartacus,People are debating over hot bodies and action while I was impressed by the way they spoke English.
Spartacus,Gay men and extremely horny women. The amount of penis in that show is insane.
Spartacus,Why not both?
Spartacus,I think you underestimate how many of adult guys have mentality of a 14 year old boy.
Spartacus,I WATCH SPARTACUS!!
Spartacus,"The first season was basically a 300 version of gladiators. I absolutely loved the show, and also my mother did. So I guess both answers are right."
Spartacus,"Is it because of all the penis you had to look at?

Target audience was anyone who likes penises, drama, weird sex scenes, ripped dudes with their dongs hanging out, some boobies, some bush, some fighting action, swords, more dicks, girls talking about dicks, some killing, I think a rape or two? Some slavery. And some dick."
Spartacus,Both of those seem pretty spot on.
Spartacus,"It’s just a testosterone filled show. Those that like Vikings, Game of Thrones, 300, etc. would enjoy the show. I enjoy it although it declined after the first season abeit still a decent show."
Spartacus,"It's filled with dicks.. As a man in my mid 30s it's nothing but I can tell you when I was 14 I certainly would not have wanted to watch a show filled with dicks. And I assume the average 14 year old hasn't changed.

I've been watching Spartacus since my early 20s and I'd say the target audience is anyone over 20 who likes sex and blood"
Spartacus,my mom
Spartacus,"I don’t think you need to say your reasoning. It’s for 14 year old boys because of all the violence and gore, and it’s for 35 year old woman because of all the hot shirtless men. Either way it fucking rules"
Spartacus,Males 15-35
Spartacus,"Me (M30) and my gf (35) both loved it. 

We went travelling for 6 months and loaded our laptop with the full series so we could pass the time. During one train journey we watched an episode and when it finished, some American guy behind us poked his head through the seat and went ""YO! What was that?? That was INTENSE!"". He'd been sitting watching the whole thing with us, if we'd known we'd have taken the headphones out so he could hear the dialogue too.

Jupiter's cock!"
Spartacus,fun fact: I watched Spartacus with my mother when I was around 14. My mother was 35 at that time.
Spartacus,"miss that show

i need to do a rewatch"
Spartacus,"Damn... I remember that at first I wanted to watch the show on a train (Long commute).

I didn't, because there were more sex scene than in GOT...

I think the target audience were young adult, men and women."
Spartacus,"If you think Spartacus is fir 35 year old women, wait until you see Outlander."
Spartacus,I watched it at first because Lucy Lawless was in it but after a few episodes I started enjoying it because of the entire cast. The finale of Season One was so satisfying. I also loved the prequel mini season but it never reached those heights again even though it was still pretty good. The naked guys were not the reason I watched it but I didn't complain about them either 😆
Spartacus,I only watched it for the mighty Ashur. That and the dudes. The dudes were a big selling point.

Maybe it’s just me, but you could’ve specified that you mean the more recent series. 

Target audience for this one I’d say is whoever is into 300, game of thrones and soft porn."

The inclusion of gay male relationships that the show wasted no time being complicated about was a breath of fresh air, especially in a show that was so testosterone driven. Steven S. DeKnight took no shit about this either. I loved it. 

And then of course the fairly juicy dialogue was always fun."
Spartacus,"Horny teenagers who have some knowledge of ancient Roman history (which I was, at the time)"
Spartacus,"As a 14 year old boy who watched it with my mother who was in her late 30s, the answer is both"
Spartacus,"I'm 31m and have been a huge fan since it dropped. There's a lot of mindless sex and violence but I was drawn to the writing and dialog. So many movies/shows about ancient Rome just make everone sound British and call it good and it feels very lazy. I love the way characters speak in Spartacus, almost as if a more direct translation from the Latin they would have spoken at the time.    
  
That and John Hannah's amazing one liners. ""*You counsel to suck the cock that pisses on me!*"" is probably one of the greatest lines in television history.  
  
Also, I met Manu Bennet (Crixus) years ago while I was working at a department store. Dude walks in with a buddy and asks my help looking at sunglasses. I asked his name because I wasn't sure it was him, he told me and I gushed for a second but he was super cool about it. Seemed a little taken aback that I knew him from Spartacus (I think this was hot off of Shanarra which was awful but we didn't know that yet). Seems like a nice guy 🤷🏻‍♂️"
Spartacus,"That show was AWESOME. It doesn't matter who it was for. I would say it's very, very much in the style of the two 300 movies and graphic novels. It's has that over-the-top comic book style, especially in some of the earlier seasons. The only reason the show wasn't completely superb is because the main character got sick and died after the first season or two. All of the other shows associated with it were good, too. Like the prequel about Gannicus.

Dope show."

Spartacus,"Started to watch it for the tits and fights. But the story made me stay til the end. I was straight and was in my 30s. If you watch a lot of porn, the amount of dicks doesn't really bother you. They develop the female characters really well that you WANT to see them naked. When that episode arrives, it's like you're seeing somebody you know naked. Way better than some random orgy scene with random naked chicks."
Spartacus,"Both.

It’s game of thrones with out the dragons and snow."
Spartacus,Well I don’t fall in either camp. A skip for me I guess.
Spartacus,15-35yo males
Spartacus,Me.
Spartacus,"14 year old boys, i'm afraid"
Spartacus,Spartacus
Spartacus,"There is a subreddit for this show, BTW. r/spartacus_tv"
Spartacus,Target audience: 35 year old women
Spartacus,"I’m female and 30+ now and watched it in my 20s when it came out… so it’s just a genre preference for me. 
Your choice makes a little more sense because of the sexualization of everything but 14?! That seems a little young (even for guys) but if you like wieners and violence, it’s the show for you! Ha!"
Spartacus,"I was the target audience. I think I was twenty something when it came out. I'll still watch anything with that premise. Cool fights, naked women, muscular dudes and their dialogue lol"
Spartacus,"Me. Literally me. 

That show fucking rules. Goofy campy fun that really delivers on emotional moments when it needs to and has some of the best live action fights I've seen in a show. Yeah there's a lot of boobs and dumb dialogue but there's also a lot of cocks and thoughtful dialogue."
Spartacus,"You might be right since i was a 35yr old woman watching it, i still say the season 1 finale 'Kill them all' was some of the best tv ever."
Spartacus,Xena showed her tits and had a deep and fucked up relationship (involving kissing) with a beautiful blonde. It was for queer women.
Spartacus,"Those of us that loved Rome on HBO and 300 from Snyder it was a great combo. Still sad about losing the first Spartacus to cancer, just lost my mom to something similar."
Spartacus,"Crazy, bloody violence. Crass language in really old timey sounding dialogue. 300-esque Stylized visuals. Sexiness and nudity from both the female and male characters. Soapy melodrama wrapped in a cool Historical setting. 

Somehow that was all made for me."
Spartacus,"I don't know, but I was 17 when the first season came out. I love period pieces and historical drama, this fit the bill. It also had foul language, blood & gore, and an insanely awesome amount of both titties and Adonis-esque male physique to drool over. Andy also made it worth watching based on his acting alone, he was fantastic."
Spartacus,Maybe you are both correct? To say the target audience was mothers and their teenage sons?
Spartacus,"""We will have words ! """
Spartacus,That shows was AMAZING! It wasn't quite the same after Andy died though.
Spartacus,"I’m a woman and watched it in my 30s. I loved it. I love sex, gore, naked men, naked women, cool costumes, a great story … basically this show hit all my buttons. My husband watched one episode and hated it, so 🤷‍♀️. Maybe I just have the mind of a 14-year-old boy?"
Spartacus,I am the target audience!
Spartacus,My boyfriend and I loved Spartacus and still quote it probably daily in some way. We’re both in our late 30s.
Spartacus,"“Once again, the Gods spread the cheeks for deeper ramming!”"
Ripper Street,"It's one of my favorite shows as well. But it's really a cult show. Not cult as in Wire or The Witcher. But a deep underground one.

But there are fans still around waiting for Reed to bellow, ""JACKSON!"" And for someone in the background to mutter, ""Not the American again,"" under their breath."
Ripper Street,"It ended it's run after 5 seasons in 2016, it had only 37 eps, and it's a good but not great show.  I have no idea why you would think you'd see much about it on reddit in 2022.  It's an old show that may be decent to watch, but it's not exactly a classic."
Ripper Street,"I loved the first three seasons, fantastic cast, writing and production value, then it floundered a bit, but these first three were pure gold. Great show"
Ripper Street,"Lol, well it's been over for quite some time. And probably not quite as well known as other series. I loved it. Funny how it got played down though as being a copycat to WhiteChapel. I saw that after Ripper Street, & didn't see it. Yes, same proximity-but not copycat."
Ripper Street,">  Why did it get completely overseen?

I am not sure what this means, I think you are asking ""Why doesn't this show get more attention?"".

It was on for five seasons and ended 6 years ago. A whole lot has happened in the TV world and in the world as a whole since it ended.

Also it was just ok. The cast is what carried it. The stories were pretty forgettable."
Ripper Street,Hardly underground it was on BBC one in the UK. It just didn't do well enough. Amazon prime took it on to keep it going but the wide fan base was not there
Ripper Street,"I would expect something about it, but the subreddit has like 500 subs…it may not be early GoT good but it’s certainly better than that"
Ripper Street,">It's an old show...     


OK zoomer."
Ripper Street,"Yeah it definitely stretched to be more than a murder mystery. I loved the touch of technological progression they added though, and the actors for the most part held their own really well despite any writing flaws. Super fun watch!"
Ripper Street,"When I watched, I wasn't in to Reddit.  Have to remember all series have there following. Those who liked/watched Ripper Street probably are not big redditors."
Ripper Street,Apparently it isn't better than that.
Ripper Street,"If you think there is lots of talk about any non-current show that isn't good enough to have a strong fanbase, you're not really paying any attention."
Ripper Street,amazon needs to get a 1000% better of advertising their actual shows.
Ripper Street,Wife and I loved the show. Sad to hear.
Ripper Street,">Ripper Street was dropped by the BBC in December 2013 after low viewing figures for its second series. Amazon stepped in a few months later and began streaming the third series last June; it also aired on BBC1 a month later.

Can't fault them for trying - I guess the numbers just weren't there.

>In May last year, Amazon commissioned a fourth and fifth series of Ripper Street; the former launched on Amazon UK on 15 January 2016.


So is the fifth season still on then? I wonder."
Ripper Street,Great show.  Quite a loss.
Ripper Street,Amazon Prime has a crap interface on a lot of devices that make it hard to navigate to well known shows let alone lesser known ones.
Ripper Street,"This sort of show isn't really on my radar but I think this story's noteworthy for a couple of reasons. Firstly, kudos to Amazon for carrying it for three seasons but kudos also to the BBC for letting someone else develop the property even if they weren't as interested."
Ripper Street,"Didn't like it as much as ""Copper"", but it wasn't bad."
Ripper Street,"Seriously, pretty much the only place I hear about their new shows is on this subreddit.  Hell when I visit Amazon, their shows are barely (if at all) visible to me. "
Ripper Street,I have Amazon Prime and I've never heard of this show.
Ripper Street,RIP Mad Dogs 
Ripper Street,It says in the article the 5th series is it's last.
Ripper Street,"Amazon carried it for three seasons?

The story last year was that the BBC were dropping it after 2 and Amazon Prime picked it up for the 3rd season, before BBC1 ended up airing season 3 itself anyway months after Amazon Prime did."
Ripper Street,it's not streaming on Amazon Prime for free which is infuriating. 
Ripper Street,That's not too bad of a run for a British show then I suppose.
Ripper Street,Yep. It's not really a cancel but just a pre announced final season
Ripper Street,Cool to see they've not dropped the 5th season immediately. Wonder if it's already been filmed.
Ripper Street,"filming is in progress, probably another month or two to go"
Ripper Street,"Holy crap, I thought we weren't getting anything after season 3! My Amazon Prime sub gets better and better every day!"
Ripper Street,...I'm just so happy right now!
Ripper Street,"Cautiously optimistic about this; I found Season 3 weaker than the previous ones and I thought it seemed to wrap up Reid's story at least, but this looks promising. The dynamic between the leads was always great, hopefully they keep that up.

I'm going to guess they're aiming for a season-long story arc again, which could work well if they have the right story idea.

Any indication of minor characters returning? I liked the bit where they brought back the disgraced lobotomist for a *Silence of the Lambs* moment in Season 2, and they had a lot of other great one-episode roles. I expect to see plenty of *Game of Thrones* alumni either way."
Ripper Street,I'm so very glad that Adam Rothenberg turned down that role in Wicked City to go back to this. I worried he might be passing up a big opportunity but that show ended up being the first one canceled... Wise choice.
Ripper Street,Amazon has already ordered Season 5.
Ripper Street,This in IMO is one of the most underrated shows glad its getting a fourth season as i really enjoyed the 3rd. So glad amazon renewed the show after the BBC cancelled it. 
Ripper Street,I was very surprised to hear it. They gave the last season an almost fairy tale like ending; he lived the rest of his days happily ever after on a beach or something. Glad though.
Ripper Street,No one fucking talks about it and yet it is so intense and amazing. 
Ripper Street,I don't understand why you would want to skip a whole season of a show you like.
Ripper Street,"I guess you can skip it but personally I wouldn't, season 3 is great. Watch the first episode of season 3 and you'll want to watch the rest. If you skip it you'll still know most the main players but you'll be lost as to why they aren't in their usual 'positions'. I'm sure you'd figure it out easily enough but I'd recommend watching 3 first.

Don't drop it, its a great show and I think its ending with season 5 so it isn't a huge future commitment."
Ripper Street,"Don't skip a single episode, this is one of the best shows on tv, period."
Ripper Street,"They're all on Amazon Prime, if that helps! "
Ripper Street,I don't understand the logic behind this question.
Ripper Street,They are still looking for Jack the Ripper 
Ripper Street,"I just watched these latest two episodes (I think, because I'm not watching it regularly).  

But I saw Neville Longbottom is in it.  Recognized him first, then double checked in the credits."
Ripper Street,It's really more of an issue of time. I just don't have as much time as I would like to devote to programs I enjoy.
Ripper Street,"Thanks, looks like I will be watching Season 3, then!"
Ripper Street,Are they free on Amazon Video?  I didn't see it.
Ripper Street,In that case just watch season 3 and wait on four
Ripper Street,"Yeah, I think so. Didn't Amazon pick up the series because the BBC cancelled it? (I know that the new series is prime eligible. Not certain about the others.)"
Ripper Street,I don't understand how this is an issue to some people lol like slow down 
Ripper Street,I just posted a more logical response. I'm not slowing down shit because I was already calm
Ripper Street,Noooo not you I was agreeing with you. I guess I worded it wrong 
Ripper Street,Is this show any good? 
Ripper Street,"It's hit and miss. There are some great episodes, but most tend towards average; it's got so much going for it (good set design and costumes; good, even great actors) but consistently undermines its potential. What could be have been a gritty, realistic London counterpart to Deadwood veers much closer to some light-beer version of Sherlock Holmes.

Season 1 has some great episodes and is, in my opinion, the best season so far. Season 2 actually gets worse (although episode 7 is one of the best in the show). I had problems staying with season 3; the writers have partially rebooted the show, placing characters in different occupations and then slowly writing them back in, which is never a good idea. There's a soapy subplot about a missing daughter, and one of the characters, Long Susan, is put in a somewhat credulity-stretching position that doesn't really work.

I'll definitely look at season 4 when it comes along, though.
"
Ripper Street,"Yes, it is. I like it."
Ripper Street,Reid's missing daughter has been a subplot of the series since the very beginning.
Ripper Street,"Yes, but it got pretty soapy in season 3."
Ripper Street,"Given the dramatic turn its taken in that direction, it's hardly surprising, but even with that development, they've still been keeping it pretty much at arms length."
Ripper Street,"I love the show. Even its utterly heartbreaking ending. It did the Victorian era fantastically. Usually with these Victorian era shows we only see the upper crust. Posh Brits doing posh things. The only time we see the lower class is if they are serving the upper class. But Ripper Street showed all the classes. The horrible, grimy dark corners of London in all their brutal glory. And there wasn't a weak performance in the cast. It was one of the few shows where I cared about everyone's storyline. Not the usual one or two and tolerated the rest while hoping we would return quickly to the more interesting one. 

For those who haven't seen it, imagine a cop show with the feel of Peaky Blinders but instead of Edwardian times, it's Victorian times. In the US, it's on Netflix. Give it a go.  "
Ripper Street,One of my favourite shows
Ripper Street,It's on Netflix. Season 5 is the last season.
Ripper Street,"Matthew Macfayden is amazing, I wish he was on TV a bit more."
Ripper Street,"Watching it all again, it seems that all of the conflict in the show can be directly attributed to stupid, emotional decisions on the part of the women, from Long Susan to Matilda Reid."

Loved Ripper Street but some of the one-shot episodes were a game of ""which Game of Thrones alumnus is going to be the villain this week?"" Some of them got really great roles though, Jerome Flynn and Iain Glen in particular. Both shows draw mostly from the UK/Irish stable for actors, so overlap is inevitable."
Ripper Street,Five. You did better than me I only noticed one 😳
Ripper Street,"IMDb lists 113 common cast and crew between the two shows.

http://www.imdb.com/search/name?roles=tt0944947,tt2183641"
Ripper Street,Iain Glen was amazing in Ripper Street.
Ripper Street,Qyburn! I can't believe I didn't see that before! Thank you.
Ripper Street,"Jeez! So, every British/Scottish/Irish  person in the industry"
Ripper Street,Ripper Street is brilliant. Damien Maloney is an extremely talented actor.
Ripper Street,"Much better, IMAO, than *Copper*. "
Ripper Street,"I haven't heard about Ripper Street yet, I'll have to look it up. If you liked Copper, you might want to check out Peaky Blinders on Netflix. I had been looking for that same turn-of-the-century cops and gangsters feel, and the show really nails it. Plus, Cillian Murphy is great at being scary as hell, haha."
Ripper Street,"Yes, Ripper Street is well-done and generally compelling IMHO"
Ripper Street,"I posted this last time somebody asked about Ripper Street. Still haven't seen the second half of the most recent season, but here are my thoughts:

I like it a lot, the writing is usually very good and the dynamic between the leads is excellent. There are a lot of great actors in it, although sometimes I can't help thinking ""Which Game of Thrones alumnus is going to turn out to be the villain this week?"" This is a very minor gripe, though, and understandable given that the acting pool in the UK and Ireland is not huge.

Season 1 is pretty much entirely case-of-the-week, but it's my personal favourite. Season 2 sort of has a season-long arc, but it is more or less dropped for the middle four episodes in favour of one-shots. So far Season 3 seems to be going for a season-long arc. I'm not entirely sold on the new season yet, but the increased budget is very welcome and they're definitely shaking up the status quo, so I'll see where it goes.

The attention to detail in the sets, props, and costumes is amazing, but the writers really love bringing real-world events into the story. Sometimes this approach works very well, but it can feel forced.

Also, while the writing for the leads (including the women) is usually great, the writing for the villains is very inconsistent. In some episodes they are terrific but in others they are flat and bland."
Ripper Street,The newest season on netflix was a bit more campy and silly in regards to fight scenes etc. I still watched it but groaned quite often. Victim of its own success
Ripper Street,Agree RIPPER ST IS JUST AS GOOD 
Ripper Street,"Loved Copper! Ripper Street is fun. Also, if you like Game of Thrones, its extra Bronn."
Ripper Street,I didn't really love the first episode and have yet to watch the second one. I wasn't as immediately hooked as I'd hoped. 
Ripper Street,Great review! I can't wait to start watching it. 
Ripper Street,"Just be prepared to want to give the Ripper Street Bronn a big hug sometimes, he needs it."
Ripper Street,"Yea I hear you, it's definitely a slow starter. The biggest problem I think is that the first and second episodes are too busy establishing the different parties in play that they don't highlight the simultaneous ambitiousness and self-hatred of Tommy Shelby. That alone is keeping me hooked in, he's a fantastic character to watch develop."
Ripper Street,"Keep watching Peaky Blinders, i promise you it gets better."
Ripper Street,"I agree. I stopped after the first episode. Someone on reditt said it was excellent so I picked it up again and it was very good, really enjoyed it. I'll have to check out Copper."
Ripper Street,"Pretty sure for the regionalized content on Amazon, you'd have to change your ""country"" in your account settings over to UK to get UK content to work, because of the how the stuff is licensed."
Ripper Street,Im still waiting for it to air on the BBC 
Ripper Street,"I looked into it a little more, and I think you'll be unable to watch that show legally from inside of the US.

Looks like BBC America has opted to take the rights for North American distribution, see here:

http://nypost.com/2014/02/26/ripper-street-to-get-third-season-in-us/

In order to stream it from the US, I believe you'd need to use a VPN service that makes you appear to be in the UK to pass muster with Amazon.co.uk, which I'm pretty sure is mildly illegal. It's also available for download the same way most shows are."
Ripper Street,They said when it airs on BBC (which it won't be on BBC America) it will be over 20 minutes shorter per episode. The season 3 episodes uncensored are running at 69 minutes. 
Ripper Street,"If one goes looking, he shall find a decent VPN service for changing region. There is an extension in Chrome that is free that fits just that (it is actually a P2P VPN)."
Ripper Street,I didn't know that thanks I will watch it on amazon instead 
Ripper Street,"Correct me if I'm wrong, did Amazon Prime buy the rights to that show?"
Ripper Street,"It's only a six-episode season this time around. Fifth season is currently filming and will come out later this year.

Edit: [This](https://twitter.com/ripper_street/status/700756146701795328) was posted on the show's Twitter during the sixth episode, confirming it was the finale."
Ripper Street,They did and they announced Season 5 was the last season. 
Ripper Street,"From what I understand, this season was Amazon Prime in the UK, and Netflix in the US.  Neither has broadcast episodes 7 or 8."
Ripper Street,"Ah!  That makes sense then!  Leave it on one hell of a cliffhanger for the season finale, make people anxious for the final season.  Thanks!"
Ripper Street,It was also aired on BBC1 months after it aired on Amazon Prime.
Ripper Street,"Frustrating, but at least we don't have to wait too long for the followup. I agree it was a great season!"
Ripper Street,"Is it any good?  

I dig the cast.  Damn, Jerome Flynn is having one hell of a career renaissance isn't he?  "
Ripper Street,"Really enjoyed the development of the three main characters and their back stories, setting up the rest of the series for a big climax. Also need to mention that Jerome Flynn's character was particularly exciting to watch. "
Ripper Street,"Just watched the pilot.....loved it.  

Thank ya'll for the endorsement.
"
Ripper Street,"Strong cast, strong writing, a refreshing & honest take on Victorian London, what's not to love? 

A detective who essentially invents forensics partnering with a ground breaking pathologist,  if Sherlock was real, this would be his story. 

It's the best bit of TV the beeb have produced in years, better even than Moffat's work on Who & Sherlock. "
Space Racers,"It's Shadow Raiders aka War Planets. 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadow_Raiders

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0169510

It aired from 1998 to 1999. 
""Shadow Raiders is a Canadian animated television series produced by Mainframe Entertainment"" which made Reboot and  Beast Wars: Transformers.

""The series focused on the four warring planets of a solar system called the Cluster as they were forced to set aside their differences and form a coalition against the menace of the Beast Planet."" 

There was Planet Rock, Fire, Bone, Ice and Beast Planet. "
Space Racers,"A 3d animated series from the 80s/early 90s? That seems off.

I'll throw Pirates of Dark Water out there just because of the fantasy element & the animation was good though traditional."
Space Racers,It was 3D animated?
Space Racers,"When you say like Zelda, you mean very early 3d animation?

The only other thing I can think of is Xiaolin Showdown (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xiaolin_Showdown), but that was early 2000's and 2d animation.

I really want to figure this out too now, any plot details you can remember?"

Space Racers,"That was my thought as well, but only because Avatar reminded me of it a bit when I first started watching it. It doesn't really hit any of his other memories. If there's one thing I've learned over the years, though, it's that memories of early childhood are unreliable at best. "
Space Racers,"Korra was really solid I thought. Not on the masterpiece level of TLA, but still pretty good."

Space Racers,">  Here comes the Korasami fans.

Pretty sure both Zaheer and Varrick's fanbases blow Korasami out of the water."
Space Racers,Korra S1 and S3 were good though. S2 wasn't the greatest and the series finale sucked.
Space Racers,Mainframe really did not branch out in art styles did they? Looks just like Reboot and Beast Wars. 
Space Racers,"Crazy, the animation reminds me of Rico's Roughness or Reboot. "
Space Racers,oh my GODD i totally forgot this existed and just got hit with a wave of nostalgia. I had a ton of toys that were these little planets that could open up and deploy figurines and stuff
Space Racers,I FORGOT ABOUT THIS SHOW!  Whether or not it would remind me of Avatar is yet to be seen though.
Space Racers,Don't listen to that guy. Watch Avatar and then Korra.
Space Racers,"Watch Korra after ATLA, but be prepared to power through the first 2 seasons. It definitely pays off when you get to season 3 and 4. Season 3 in particular is almost my favourite season of any TV show, ever.

"
Space Racers,"Takes place 75 years after TLA. 

Animation was great, but the dry stories, non stop love triangles, etc., simply killed it for myself, and everyone that I knew who used to like the Avatar series."
Space Racers,"Watch Last Airbender, then Korra.  Be warned that Korra starts out kind of weak in the first season and season 2 isn't much better.  However season 3 is fantastic, and 4 is almost as good.  All in my opinion of course."
Space Racers,"Seasons one and three of Korra are very good, season three being just absolutely awesome. Season two was okay, but season four sucked mainly cause of the forced ending. 

The problem the show suffered from was lack of continuity. It was supposed to have been just one season, then another got ordered, then two more got ordered (or something like that). Overall, it was really good, with excellent fights."
Space Racers,"No way, not even close. I criticized the ending for S4 when it aired for being too damned forced, and was basically told by a bunch of people on the subreddit ""we don't know what happened off-screen"" and ""they're here, they're queer, get used to it"", shit like that."
Space Racers,"I mean, you have to remember this was CG animation in the mid/late 90s. There wasn't a lot of technology to work with that would've looked good and been affordable for 20 episode seasons every year. They had a style, to be sure, but they at least refined it a bit show by show.

But that aside, their later work tended to vary it up a bit more, tossing in cel-shading and stuff. Unfortunately that's about the time their talent completely dropped off."
Space Racers,"You're thinking of Roughnecks, which wasn't a mainframe show but was really, really good. I think Crackle has it?"
Space Racers,Ok
Space Racers,Season 3 is better than season 1 of TLA but not better than 2 or 3. Season 1 is about on par with season 1 of TLA. 4 is good but it had rushed character development and 2 is pretty garbage comparatively.
Space Racers,"Season 1 is conceptually pretty awesome and doesn't require too much dragging through but other than the Wan episodes season 2 is pretty damn weak, yea "
Space Racers,"Same here. It wasn't bad, just didn't find it anywhere near as good as the original."
Space Racers,"And if I were to criticize the R+L scene in Game of Thrones, I'd get a bunch of replies back about how awesome R+L.  I'd guess from that you'd assume that R+L is the only thing going for Game of Thrones?

You can't judge an entire show based on the replies you get from criticizing one scene of the show."
Space Racers,"I remember it had a really early time slot,  right after the evangelicals and right before pokemon. It's totally on Crackle!"
Space Racers,"I'm confused about your comment. Neither you nor I were criticizing shows, only the ferocity of certain fanbases. "
Space Racers,"And what have you done to gauge the relative ferocity of Korra's other fanbases?  Did you ever criticize the ending of season 3, for example?

I'm just saying that if you criticize X, then you'll likely get people defending X and X alone.  That alone isn't sufficient to determine the fanbases for any elements Y, Z, or any others."
Space Racers,"So then what did you do to say that Varrick's and Zaheer's fanbases are worse than Korrasami's? Besides Zaheer being a decent villain and antagonist, and people finding Varrick's ""do the thing"" meme amusing, what about their fanbases show that they'd ""blow Korrasami out of the water""?"
Space Racers,"Most times I see people talk about their favorite parts of the show om general it's invariably either season 3, and Zaheer particular that made season 3 great, or it's Varrick and how they loved his comedy.  Comments criticizing season 4 are going to specifically trigger Korrasami fans, it's not a great gauge for what the general fanbase enjoys the most about the show.  Hell, you yourself seem to be a fan of season 3, why would you think yourself in the minority there?"
Space Racers,"We weren't talking about the general fanbase for the show, though. We were talking about *specific* fanbases, i.e. Korrasami. My ire with that group comes from the fact that, at the time the S4 ending aired, I was indirectly called homophobic and such because I didn't subscribe to that shipping. Hell, if the creators hadn't written that blog the day after that began with ""Korrasami is canon"", I'd *still* argue that that pairing isn't canon and people are seeing only what they want to see.

Generally, I liked the show. I've got the blu-rays of the first three seasons. It suffers flaws, yeah, but I thought it was pretty good overall. I only thought specific parts were weak, such as the finale in S4 and the giant/megazord-like battle in S2."
Space Racers,"> We weren't talking about the general fanbase for the show, though. We were talking about specific fanbases, i.e. Korrasami.

And you specifically said the fanbases for Zaheer and Varrick weren't anywhere close to Korrasami.  At this point you seem as preoccupied with season 4's ending as much as the shippers, I'm just pointing out that there are people who love the show for many reasons other than season 4's ending."
Space Racers,"I should have said enthusiastic instead of ferocious. My bad, I was thinking negatively.

>Zaheer and Varrick weren't anywhere close to Korrasami

That's because the Korrasami fanbase's defense of a poorly executed portion of the show wasn't just enthusiastic, it was vitriolic. They'd call you homophobic or bigoted if you didn't like or agree with it, it was tumblr-tier levels of obnoxious. Neither of the Zaheer nor Varrick fanbases came close to what I saw from the Korrasami fanbase. This was my original point, sorry for stating it poorly."
Regular Show,that was a great episode
Regular Show,Thank you for posting this. I forgot about this episode!
Regular Show,Y'know who else is a great cartoon?
Regular Show,"Regular Show and Adventure Time. Shit makes me super nostalgic, I totally get it. They're both such amazing shows.

Edit: typo"
Regular Show,"Regular Show is responsible for my kids' love and appreciation for some really excellent 80s music.

I actually cried at the series finale. Not ashamed to admit it.

Brilliant show."
Regular Show,Have you watched Close Enough on Netflix? Same creator. Its very good
Regular Show,Yeah I watched Regular Show when it first aired. And I could tell the creators had to have been close to my age because I would always notice references and hidden jokes that reminded me of my childhood. Have you seen the movie?
Regular Show,I always get Regular Show mixed up with Mr. Show.
Regular Show,"you should watch JG Quintel's short that became regular show if you haven't.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1AQJQ7o62g"
Regular Show,"Watch ""close enough"" its basically adult regular show same creator and voice actors and has regular show references"
Regular Show,"It is truly a masterpiece in weird tv, now some baby ducks have asked you to Step Off!"
Regular Show,"I love this show a lot, I even still watch it even if it's aimed for kids."
Regular Show,Regular Show is basically a kids version of Bojack Horseman
Regular Show,"Every now and then, I'll watch a random episode or three. It's always a good time."
Regular Show,Regular Show is definitely a fun show. I prefer it juuuuuuust over Adventure Time and it's a genuinely tough choice imo
Regular Show,One of my favourite episodes is Donut Factory Holiday. Probably one of the most normal episodes but the sheer absurdity of trying to get Rigby’s hand out of the VCR sells it.
Regular Show,MY MOMMMMM
Regular Show,Your Dad?
Regular Show,It absolutely blew my mind when I found out the genius behind Regular Shows music choices was the main person behind Devo.
Regular Show,Isnt that a hbo max shwo
Regular Show,I started watching the Regular Show after watching and loving Close Enough.
Regular Show,I love both
Regular Show,The acid trip in the convenience store? I saw that already. It wa cool
Regular Show,The little pop after they karate chop the guy in half always gets me.
Regular Show,I was in my 30s when I watched it for the first time and I loved it. It has that magical quality that can make an adult reconnect with his younger self.
Regular Show,"> I even still watch it even if it's aimed for kids

Who a show is aimed at honestly shouldn't be a consideration at all in terms of deciding whether to watch it. The *only* things that make stuff explicitly ""adult shows"" are higher levels of profanity/sex/violence (you could turn a ""kids' show"" into an ""adult show"" by adding some of that while changing literally nothing else), and it's perfectly fine for adults to be interested in stuff without those things. Shows targeted at kids often have tones and styles that just flat-out don't exist in ""adult"" shows, and I'd argue that in the vast majority of cases ""kids' shows"" are *really* just a sort of different genre or approach, not anything that's inherently ""for kids."""
Regular Show,Regular Show is basically a kids version of Bojack Horseman
Regular Show,Rugrats as well
Regular Show,Close Enough
Regular Show,Netflix has Close Enough in territories outside the USA. At least in some of them.
Regular Show,Same here. Childfree night had me falling out of my chair.
Regular Show,"40's for me, loved it"
Regular Show,"Yeah I did also try to watch it while I was young but couldn't get into it then, but as an adult, I find it funnier than I used to."
Regular Show,Literally the only comparison I see is that they both have anthropomorphic animals and humans living in the same world...
Regular Show,I see what u did there! Clever!
Regular Show,The humor is similar. I don’t understand why you downvoted me
Regular Show,"I didn't downvote you; somebody else did. (Honestly, I'm surprised that somebody was even still here to see this thread to downvote you again for the reply here, but that genuinely wasn't me, either.)

And I suppose I can see your point to an extent; some of the more wacky/surreal-type humor that BoJack occasionally has is sort of similar, I guess. I still wouldn't really categorize them very closely together, though."
Regular Show,The episode where he gets absolutely shredded is hilarious
Regular Show,"One of my favorite scenes is in an earlier episode and their kid is being babysat and they are alluding to what they'll do with their night home alone, and then proceed to do a bunch of errands.

Remarkably relatable at times. The skateboarding episode was also a good one."
Regular Show,"I was pleasantly surprised it got a season 2, when I had seen so little about season 1 online. Had no idea a season 3 dropped 3 days ago until I Googled it just now… Guess I know what I’m doing with my day off tomorrow"
Regular Show,They’ve got some misses but when it hits it hits just as hard as the top Regular Show episodes do
Regular Show,It's a fun show. I created the Wikipedia page of 'Close Enough' in my country. Waiting for the release of season 1 was torture. They showed an exciting trailer and then pretty much disappeared for years.
Regular Show,"r/closeenough

Sub for it is very active if you want discussion & stuff about it"
Regular Show,This show is so relatable that it hurts a little
Regular Show,You know who else would like this show? My mom!
Regular Show,"This is a show where I appreciate that the parents really do love their kid and want to make the best out of it, like not begrudgingly but because they genuinely want the best for their daughter.

And this is someone who doesn't want their own kids. Haha."
Regular Show,"This show is *great* but despite being in my 30s I still relate better to Mordecai and Rigby, oops"
Regular Show,It really is the absurdism of Regular Show applied to people in their early 30’s and that’s why I love it. Down to its great side characters and silly plot lines.
Regular Show,Love it!
Regular Show,It's so fantastic and poignant. The commentary is so relatable. I really enjoy it as well.
Regular Show,[deleted]
Regular Show,I just feel like I compare it to regular show too much. I just feel like it will never be as good as the regular show. I have only seen the first season so I’m going to give it another try. Thank you for posting.
Regular Show,Great show.
Regular Show,"Tbh Is not as good as a regular show, but it's close enough"
Regular Show,I still love it into season 3 but season 1 was absolutely the most hilarious imo.
Regular Show,I'm in my early 40's and it's absolutely relevant to me as well.
Regular Show,such a good show!
Regular Show,"First of all, yes it is fantastic!
Second of all, should just say anyone with young kids. I’m in my mid/late 30s and have a 2 year old and find it very relatable still."
Regular Show,"I’ll have to give it a shot but given that I hated The Regular Show’s style thematically and artistically, I’m thinking it’s probably not for me. But ya never know because I was never wild about Bob’s Burgers but love The Great North."
Regular Show,"#i'm gonna stick with the Golden Girls for now bro.
#But thanks for the recommendation"
Regular Show,"Or the 60s kids, 50s kids, etc...everyone struggles with growing up and losing their cool..."
Regular Show,"Well his original creation was Close Enough but im sure when he pitched it CN thought it would do better as teen show instead of an Adult swim show

Heres the original if you havent seen before: https://youtu.be/Zk9eLbi0QYg"
Regular Show,"Everyone should be seeing thid shoe its so great! 
JG quintell doenst miss !"
Regular Show,I only watched like 10 episodes of it but I found Regular Show to be much better. I feel like the 20 minute episodes don't fit the show's style as well as the 11 minute episodes of Regular Show.
Regular Show,"It’s a cute little show, not as good as Regular Show but I assume it’s just as relatable for a different age demographic."
Regular Show,I love that show. It always goes into some wierd tangent where you don't expect. highly creative. i wish there were more episodes .. it's on netflix in canada so hopefully that third season will be on there soon
Regular Show,I watched season 1 but never went back. It seemed a little cheesy to me.
Regular Show,"Emily trying to confront Josh about how him getting addicted to working out is bad, but consistently being too turned on by her jacked husband to do it is an amazing plot line."
Regular Show,Turn down for what!?
Regular Show,"""Doing their taxes"" was frightingly accurate."
Regular Show,I legit went on HBO Max a few days ago hoping for a season 3. Thanks for confirming!
Regular Show,"Damn I keep pretty up to date on TV news (at least for stuff I’m into), but I had NO clue that season 3 came out this week! Feels like a bit of a marketing failure."
Regular Show,"When Close Enough was originally made for TBS a few years back, they made the first two seasons together. So the Season 3 renewal was the first ""Hey it's popular enough for a renewal"" we got!"
Regular Show,"Netflix bugs the crap out of me for shows I don’t care about while HBO neglects to tell me about new seasons of shows I love. I knew it was this month, but I didn’t know it was up till I read you comment so thanks!"
Regular Show,"There is a season 3?!

Hope it gets released in my region then"
Regular Show,I didn't even know there was a season 2 yet!
Regular Show,season three was better than season one and a good rebound after season two
Regular Show,"The creator explained that it was originally going to go to to TBS, until Turner/Warner began talks on creating HBO Max and they thought Close Enough would be a better fit for that."
Regular Show,"Was there even a trailer? I remember it being announced, and then nothing for a solid couple of years before ANY word about it was spoken."
Regular Show,Thanks!
Regular Show,I'm glad you liked it man! :)
Regular Show,"Same. Every time I watch it, I always think to myself that I could just be rewatching Regular Show."
Regular Show,Sabrina don't just stare at it. Eat it.
Regular Show,Why you so loud?
Regular Show,The episodes are 11 minutes. I'm not sure you actually watched this show.
Regular Show,"That's the plot of a Family Guy episode.

Edit: Though there it is plastic surgery, not exercise."
Regular Show,"Here's netflix: ""Don't forget to watch Star Trek Voyager and see how it ends!""

OK Netflix i've watched all of voyager a few times through now. I'll come to you when i'm ready"
Regular Show,"On that note, it's *finally* getting a run on TBS after so long. They're airing a few Max originals on TV, but they'll usually be one and done, without any reruns. Still neat to see though."
Regular Show,"Just to clarify-it was originally gonna be on TBS, debuting their animation block along with the Louis CK show. Then, well, all the drama about Louis CK went down, which got that animated show canceled entirely, then Close Enough just kinda sat around for a few years before it came out on HBO Max."
Regular Show,In 2017. They called it a [sneak peek](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S33uf3E4UT4).
Regular Show,"Ironically the drugs being blatantly shown made it feel less mature than Regular Show’s later seasons. People weren’t so hot on love triangles and whatnot but there was a level of maturity that I’d not really seen in western animation for its subject matter. The character development was top-notch, to the point that Rigby season 1 is not the same as Rigby season 7.

I skip season 8 and just watch the finale though. That was a bad Futurama ripoff."
Regular Show,So the millennials can read the text
Regular Show,They are 20 minute episodes split up into two halves. Yeah it's essentially just two 11 minute episodes but my experience watching it was that the episodes seemed to feel longer and not as funny as regular show to me. I watched some episodes just as the first season came out so I misremembered and thought the episodes were 20 minutes long.
Regular Show,and was a wasted plot in a The amazing world of Gumball Episode
Regular Show,"We used to have TBS in Canada. A comedy movie would be like 2.5 hours with an HOUR of commercials in it. Eventually we got our own version of TBS called ""peachtree"" which was similarly egregious with the ads"
Regular Show,Are Millenials the olds now?
Regular Show,"The episodes were originally written as 22 minutes, but were cut up to be 11 each. But I don't think each set of 11 was one 22 in its own, I think they mixed and matched. 

So I'm not really sure how it's any different from just watching two regular show episodes.

There are two episodes now, though, one in the first season and one in this most recent third season, that are full 22 minute episodes."
Regular Show,"Its a joke... considering I'm saying I'd rather watch ""The Golden Girls"" instead of some new edgy animated series 😂"
Regular Show,You make strong points and I'd like to subscribe to your newsletter.
Regular Show,My newsletter subscription is bundled with my milkman delivery services

Pingu,"And sadly, he was fired from the show because the original production house was bought by an English company who couldn't be bothered working with a man who couldn't speak English."
Pingu,"Jeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeesus

Haven't thought about this show in 25+ something years. Loved the shit out of this, quite the impact & fun show without any talking. The animation and over the top stretching/squishing bodies conveyed the story very well!

Twas my shit on TVO Kids back in the day"
Pingu,Noot Noot.
Pingu,"For the '70s/'80s kids, Carlo Bonomi first reached fame with the splendid [""La Linea"",](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZC8wnI6XoOY) also done in full italian gibberish. The show had inspired [""Mickey Mousing""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mickey_Mousing) instrumentals.

Pingu,"I LOVE PINGU. I discovered the show when I was searching for things to watch on Netflix with my young sons who were 5 and 3 at the time. It was by far my favorite thing to watch with them. My youngest, who is now 9, and I still talk Penguinese to each other.

My favorite episode is  [Stinky Pingu](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sS-J2FTiB3M)"

Pingu,I used to rent Pingu at Blockbuster
Pingu,NOOT NOOT
Pingu,"Pingu is comedic genius, loved this as a kid.

Also enjoyed that my grandma who didn't speak English could watch with us"
Pingu,"On second thought, let’s not talk in  Grammelot. It is a silly language."

Pingu,"They actually made a new series called ""Pingu in the City"" that was made in Japan."
Pingu,"Beat me to it.

Noot Noot."
Pingu,La Lina was awesome
Pingu,"That was my question, but I don't see anything in the article to suggest it's an actual language with rules or consistency rather than a ""language"" in the looser sense of that's how the characters speak."
Pingu,In 2017? Seems a little late for PS1.
Pingu,I meant back in the late 90s/early 2000s.
Pingu,"I recently watched this episode at night and I regret everything about that decision because I could not sleep for the entire night after watching the episode because I was scared I was going to get nightmares about that walrus and I am 19.

I have never seen a more scary piece of stop motion animation like this one besides the scene about Satan from the adventures of Mark twain movie or perhaps the scene where oogie boogie dies and gets skinned alive in the nightmare before Christmas ."
Pingu,I can't believe they got David Lynch to direct an episode of Pingu.
Pingu,"JFC when it eats the mattress and does that flex with its nose, chilling."
Pingu,Noot noot!
Pingu,"I agree on that one.

I also found the other parts of the episode really freaking disturbing such as the part where the igloo flies away or when the bed turns alive."
Pingu,"Too many ""noot-noots"". You gotta have exactly 1 per episode otherwise it's not special.

You have to savor the ""noot-noot"""

Pingu,I hope they show Pingus dark origin story from the manga.
Pingu,"The characters just seem flimsy and uninteresting now, where is the consistency?"

PAW Patrol,"""What if we put TV....on the internet?"""
PAW Patrol,🎵57 channels and nothin on.🎵
PAW Patrol,We've come full circle...
PAW Patrol,Call me crazy but I actually miss being able to flip through channels and landing on something in progress. When given free reign like on Netflix I often times end up watching nothing.
PAW Patrol,Rumor has it the Star Trek stream wi be called Spike TV.
PAW Patrol,"In anyone is interested, Adult Swim has been doing this on their website for years. I’ll regularly put on the Venture Bros stream while working."
PAW Patrol,This was something I liked about Peacock.  Glad to see it here as well.
PAW Patrol,"I know a lot of people call it stupid or backwards..

But there is something very satisfying about channel flipping. 

I'm not sure if there's a mention of ads, but assuming there are none in between airing, I can't see the problem.

You can channel browse and maybe hit a gem, or you can log in and go straight to what you want."
PAW Patrol,....I'm actually gonna keep the spongebob channel on 24/7 tho.
PAW Patrol,The first streaming service to create a Playlist function will get a lifetime subscriber out of me. It's such a no Brainer. Just let me stack a couple Christmas episodes of different shows together. The fact that most already have themed lists but don't let you create one yourself is maddening.
PAW Patrol,"Disney Plus needs this too.

Imagine Simpsons World"
PAW Patrol,"There are two types of people in this thread:

1. The people who read the article and understand the product being offered.
2. People who hate television but are still subscribed to /r/television and any time any streaming service changes anything regardless of content they start tearing garments and counting out pills"
PAW Patrol,People obviously want this on all aps. Personally it's kinda stressful to go to Netflix and pick out of their 800000 shows which one you will watch. It was kinda nice when you only had 1 or two shows to watch at 830 on a Wednesday because you didn't have to think.
PAW Patrol,"Look it's evolving, but backwards!"
PAW Patrol,That Paw Patrol will come in handy for my daughter. Sponge Bob will come in handy for me
PAW Patrol,"Watching ST Discovery is a pain and a chore, but I keep watching it on Netflix. And now they took it away, I don’t have any desire to go chase it."
PAW Patrol,"The good old SpongeBob or the shit, weirdly disturbing new seasons of Spongebob?

This is actually really important."
PAW Patrol,SpongeBod and Paw Patrol are better written than Discovery. Maybe they're hoping the target demographic of the former two will like the later.
PAW Patrol,"This is exactly what people want. Plutotv has limited channel selection where I imagine this has complete access to all episodes on full series which I assume are in the rotation


Looks like it shows a series of one show, then transitions to a series of a number of the next"
PAW Patrol,"I mean...this sounds awesome to me. If they can air the I Love Lucy episodes that we can't get on streaming like Hulu (which I guess is doubtful, sadly) then I'm for sure getting Paramount Plus at some point in '22. This is offering a lot of things I like, I also hear AUS Survivor is on there too, which is cool. Paramount Plus seems to be doing things right even though it's late in becoming a streaming service."
PAW Patrol,Paramount is truly the king of squeezing everything off their biggest franchises. Just such an unambitious studio in general.
PAW Patrol,"> 24-Hour Stream for Star Trek

That's what it's like in my home already. What's the big deal?"
PAW Patrol,"For years I've been saying that Netflix should have a collection of channels constantly playing content, kinda like HBO channels on tv. Seems like the trend is finally happening..."
PAW Patrol,"We need more of this. For all its faults, Peacock has this and it’s my main way of watching Psych lately. And I find myself gravitating towards Psych more often just because I know it’s there."
PAW Patrol,"Immediately opened the app to check it out. 

Then remembered I'm in Canada so i can't have nice things."
PAW Patrol,"So Justin.tv has come back, but now we pay for it."
PAW Patrol,Peacock also has this
PAW Patrol,I do wish I could watch Star Trek on shuffle. Just throw all 800+ eps in the hopper and see what comes out.
PAW Patrol,Now we can get back to making the jokes bout there being all kinds of channels but nothing to watch!
PAW Patrol,"I mean spotify has the playlist game on lock, I would copy that as a video service.  

The problem is that these companies don't want you just playing shit in the background because servers are expensive. Also, if you are concerned about the earth you probably shouldn't be doing this either as those data centers generate a ton of green house emissions. The difference between streaming audio only and video is significant."
PAW Patrol,ThTs almost worth it for Star Trek lol
PAW Patrol,Meh.
PAW Patrol,"Fools, that's already on YouTube for free."
PAW Patrol,"Honestly, specifically with Star Trek, this sounds great to me. Star Trek is my #1 “half listening” franchise"
PAW Patrol,"""24 hour stream for Spongebob""

Oh so they're just airing Nickelodeon"
PAW Patrol,“Who would want this?!” Children. If there was a 24-hour SpongeBob channel I would’ve watched that and only that
PAW Patrol,"Paramount really needs to fix their platform. 

Can't restart anything and they cut the ends off movies all the time. 

I fell asleep watching Star Trek Beyond (I had never seen it before) and it's stuck in this perpetual loop at the end. Can't rewind it (which their fast forward and rewind option is incredibly slow so make sure you finish what you're watching, or don't start the next episode of anything if you're gonna pass out). When I start it back up, it just ends immediately. So the movie is now unwatchable. Nothing I can do to rewatch the movie."
PAW Patrol,"For people who can only make decisions up to a very specific point.

“I want to watch Trek, but no idea what episode and I don’t want to browse…but please can we filter out Discovery, Picard, and seasons 1 and 2 of _everything_ except TOS?”"
PAW Patrol,I’ve been wanting things like that for series i’ve already finished
PAW Patrol,"Or like track the shit I like and show me more of things that I will actually like. If Amazon somehow knows I need a 5 gallon stock pot, then Netflix can cut my scroll time down."
PAW Patrol,"24-hour nonstop Paw Patrol? 

RIP to the sanity of parents everywhere"
PAW Patrol,"Retro Nickelodeon or GTFO (it would be awesome if they could / would include period-specific commercials too, but I know that’s a pipe dream).

Paramount Plus has a really solid lineup of classic Nick shows and, considering how often I’ve seen people online ask for it, it’s a huge missed opportunity not to have that IMO.

Hopefully that’ll be added in the near future."
PAW Patrol,"We've got this really awesome web service that lets you watch any episode whenever you want. It's called Netflix.

You should try imitating that."
PAW Patrol,Obligatory euthanize Chase the cop dog
PAW Patrol,I wonder what the purpose of a 24 hour stream is when you can just choose whatever want to watch whenever you want to watch it anyway.
PAW Patrol,*hoists main sail*
PAW Patrol,Time is a flat circle
PAW Patrol,"Its fine as long as ads are not forced. We will mot pay for a service with ads. It has ads and free that is fine, if qe pay monthly,  no ads."
PAW Patrol,What the hell is a linear theme?
PAW Patrol,It amazes me that repurposing stuff that is available on demand actually gets people to watch it like a linear channel.
PAW Patrol,"Paw Patrol is worse than brain cancer for children, fuck that shit."
PAW Patrol,"I just don't get it. Do I want to turn this on and see the middle of season 2 episode 8 of Discovery? Or do I want to watch the next episode when I'm available...

Hrm... weighing my options here..."
PAW Patrol,"So you still pay for Paramount plus in order to access these channels.....what's the point then? Why not make a deal with Roku and Amazon and Plex, etc l, and have those channels added to the lineup of other free tv streaming channels. 
I have an antenna on my Roku TV. They merged the live OTA broadcasts with the internet streaming channels so it's all in one menu (scroll through local OTA channels first, then a small separator, then about a hundred streaming channels, all very seamless). Just put those channels out there with ad support and you'll probably make more money off it. Nobody is buying paramount plus as it is, and certainly nobody is going to pay to run a channel when they can just open the show they want. I get what they are trying to do, I don't think it's being implemented right"
PAW Patrol,What on earth is this about?
PAW Patrol,I don’t understand who these “channels” are for. Peacock does the same thing and it’s like watching the absolute worst channels on cable
PAW Patrol,"Live stream is dead.  That whole model is becoming obsolete.   My parents are are the only ppl that have cable and they're 75.  Why anyone is investing in live TV now is stupid.  
Most ppl want to watch what they want when  they want, commercial free."
PAW Patrol,It would certainly cut resource overhead. Read and prep one video file to stream to multiple users at the same instant. Back to good ol VLC style streaming.
PAW Patrol,This is going to make babysitting much more torturous
PAW Patrol,"The picture gives me weird uncanny valley vibes, isn’t that a real person?"
PAW Patrol,Bobpants Squaresponge
PAW Patrol,"I didn’t think paramount + was gonna have enough content to keep me subscribed but there’s usually something new I want to see, or rewatching Reno 911 doesn’t really get old."
PAW Patrol,"I wish they would focus on making a less buggy better app, and actually delivering the UEFA matches that they outbid better providers for. Their coverage - if you can actually see it - is terrible. It’s literally the only reason I pay for paramount plus, and they completely kick the dog in every sense."
PAW Patrol,I love this news.  Always wanted a randomize button for a series.
PAW Patrol,Oh boy I'm getting Justin tv vibes
PAW Patrol,"[TVO does this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SD3Ot30ITvU), great for kids. It has stopped lots of arguments about what show is next."
PAW Patrol,"Yeah picking any episode you want is cool, but sometimes I just want to watch TV"
PAW Patrol,"have they improved their whole app though because it was so slow and glitchy, like I couldn't even rewind without it messing up."
PAW Patrol,Why does she always looks like a space Karen?
PAW Patrol,I finally gave into Paramount + and now I'm all caught up on Rugrats so priorities
PAW Patrol,"So they're just like PlutoTV now?  Depending on the implementation it could be great. 


It won't be tho."
PAW Patrol,I wish one of them was a 1980s MTV format with wall to wall music videos and nothing else 24-7.
PAW Patrol,Pluto would like a word.
PAW Patrol,Did the lady in the picture get better at acting? Cuz I would like to watch the show but she literally had ONE FACIAL EXPRESSION
PAW Patrol,So I guess Pluto TV?
PAW Patrol,so basically Pluto TV?
PAW Patrol,Why does this look like a character create screen lol
PAW Patrol,Ways to annoy parents for $200…
PAW Patrol,Isn't this basically Pluto TV?
PAW Patrol,Paramount: why wont anyone subscribe
PAW Patrol,Uhhh adult swim does this for free
PAW Patrol,I love they are copying IPTV services. Good job.
PAW Patrol,"24 hours of Star Trek discovery, that’s like elevator music"
PAW Patrol,I want 24/7 Picard and sisko not this trash ass discovery be tho
PAW Patrol,Im hoping they do this also for the Australian Paramount.  I would be interested in this.
PAW Patrol,Is this a joke?
PAW Patrol,We have gone full circle….
PAW Patrol,I find the characters in SpongeBob to be more mature than their counterparts in Star Trek discovery.
PAW Patrol,They should have one of them be all music videos. Call it something like Music TV.
PAW Patrol,"Hell yeah, great move!  Excited to put this on after a long day"
PAW Patrol,Updated the app. Can’t see this live section anywhere. Where can you find it?
PAW Patrol,I love these types of channels. Pluto TV has a bunch of them. They’re great to just put on in the background.
PAW Patrol,spongebob POG
PAW Patrol,ITT: people wanting cable TV
PAW Patrol,"This is the exact a la carte service people have been clamoring for for decades now. It’s disheartening to see people saying “just like TV.”

Yeah, it’s like TV. But throughout my gig in cable TV customer service and sales, this is what almost every customer asked for. 

Even with Hulu Live and other streaming, you’re paying for stuff you’re never going to use. PlutoTV is a good alternative for aggregating content for free (with ads) while opening this sort of service for more specific content is a great option. 

These changes are great news for cord cutters and weary cable subscribers."
PAW Patrol,"I love streaming TV, especially when it's on a movie app"
PAW Patrol,Too bad the functionality of their app is garbage. I have to force quit it to play the next episode of something. It just freezes on the loading screen or gives me an error. They have decent content just a really bad app
PAW Patrol,"Ya they crash constantly like peacock and have nothing on.  It's a playlist, not like a live channel."
PAW Patrol,Nice
PAW Patrol,"For all 12 people who bought paramount plush, this could be great!"
PAW Patrol,I really hope this means 24/7 paw patrol because that just sounds so funny.
Pocoyo,Yeah I've been noticing that... Lots if kids shows now have snotty little shits for main characters. Caillou being the obvious holy grail.
Pocoyo,"The thing that really bothers me is the railroad owner's policy on rolling stock. They must be running 20+ locomotives, no two are alike. Steam electric diesel they run everything. Talk about a maintenance nightmare. Must be costing them a fortune in running costs."
Pocoyo,"Watch the octonauts instead man. By far the best show on bbc children's television. The characters are genuinely interesting and have to figure out tough situations and overcome their own weaknesses. Every episode includes awesome true facts about the ocean and ocean creatures, and it is even frequently funny. Actual compelling science fiction, for 3-6 year olds."
Pocoyo,"Chuggington is to Thomas the Train as Gobots were to Transformers. Don't bother trying to make sense of it, just realize it belongs on a shelf at a dollar store."
Pocoyo,"I've never heard of Chuggington, but this is the best thing I've read all day."
Pocoyo,[deleted]
Pocoyo,Paw Patrol is always successful....
Pocoyo,These trains need a little discipline.  See [the sad story of henry](http://m.youtube.com/watch?v=iO6qIM2WO6k) for an example of what might work.  
Pocoyo,"Jees, just wait until you see peppa pig, nothing quite like the whole family humiliating the dad every episode to inspire the children of today."
Pocoyo,"Yes, another with hatred in his heart for Chuggington! Oh, this just feels so good to know about you and the others who have gathered here on this post to disparage that awful show! May Chuggington be utterly vanquished, the creators incinerated, and all evidence of its existence struck from history! 

And for me, the absolute worst part of the show is the intro song. They just repeat Chuggington continually! IT'S SO AWFUL! Chuggington is just a Thomas wannabe!"
Pocoyo,I saw my 1st episode of Chuggington the other day w/ young niece & was thinking the same thing.
Pocoyo,"This is basically all modern cartoons, especially those aimed at younger kids.

Take moral lesson. Remove anything pertaining to morality. Poorly wrap it in anthropmorphic animals or vehicles. Profit."
Pocoyo,"If Chuggington pisses you off, never watch Max and Ruby."
Pocoyo,Plot twist: Charles Manson was raised by a TV also.
Pocoyo,"It's sad that I know exactly which episode you're talking about. I agree with you the show is bad. Thankfully my kids never got into it, they do however, LOVE Peppa Pig. "
Pocoyo,Mike the Knight is the worst for this. God I hate that little shit.
Pocoyo,"Yup, Chuggington, Mike the Knight, The Little Princess: They are the worst. Whining little turds that don't learn and aren't disciplined."
Pocoyo,"Just wanted to say I enjoyed reading this post , you explained the little shits so well!"
Pocoyo,"Sheriff Callie, there's an episode where the two pigs or skunks or whatever belch without saying excuse me and the deputy threatens to arrest them for not having manners.


Peppa Pig has the mother always insulting the father, in the episode where the queen is giving away a vacation for the hardest worker mom pig looks right at dad pig and says ""well it certainly won't be you dad pig"""
Pocoyo,I've seen that fucking show. The fat controller needs to get down there and kick some ass. He's a stone cold mother fucker and don't take no shit from no stupid train. 
Pocoyo,"I think the only thing ""good"" about Chuggington is their opening theme. Slightly catchy, although pretty uh . . . yep. That's all I really have to say. 

A lot of kid's shows these days are kinda like that. Main character fucks up, plot armor lets them get through it all with some sort of bullshit like ""oh no that's what we WANTED you to do you're cool"", everyone drives away happy go lucky without any care or worry in the world without learning anything, rinse and repeat.

Sorry if I'm sounding like an old crank here, but I miss the kid's shows I grew up on. Berenstein Bears, Little Bear, Spongebob, etc. where characters fucked up and it -meant- something lol Kid's shows nowadays are just creating a society of whiners and half-ass'ers. "
Pocoyo,"If the trains on that show learned their lesson every time, there would not be much to learn later. Just trains following orders and never screwing up. What's the point in that? "
Pocoyo,"This is pretty typical for kid shows. Character does something wrong because they do what they want instead of what they are supposed to do. Character realizes it sometimes by themselves or sometimes when it is pointed out. Character tries to make amends, and everyone forgives character. Ever watched an episode of Thomas the Train or Ni Hao Kai-lan?"
Pocoyo,"This is hilarious, loved the show tho"
Pocoyo,"I watched Caillou once, to see how bad it was. I had Excel open and kept track. **In the first 90 seconds, Caillou whined three distinct times.**

People are not exaggerating about that show. I timestamped every time he whined, and it averaged out to about once per minute. And it's not like he ever get chastised for whining. The show literally teaches kids to be annoying little whiners.

TLDR: Caillou will make your kids worse."
Pocoyo,caillou? more like callous.
Pocoyo,"Henry Hugglemonster is no better, that little shit will do anything but what he is told. I wont let my daughter watch that Disney Jr. garbage."
Pocoyo,Pocoyo is an asshole too. 
Pocoyo,Teaching our kids bad business practices! The nerve
Pocoyo,"Don't even get me started on the impracticality of creating an entire city around rails instead of cars.

And don't worry about maintenance because they have the equivalent of an MRI for trains that can talk and tell them exactly what is wrong."
Pocoyo,Hell they bricked up a perfectly good locomotive in a tunnel for years because it didn't want to get dirty in the rain. Just a massive misuse of resources all round.
Pocoyo,"I know it's 7 years later, but I completely agree with this, haha.

Everytime I watch this I find myself picking apart the infrastructure of this ridiculous city. For instance one of the engines had to train to move shipping containers - they somehow arranged them all in a house of cards kind of formation. Completely unsafe by shipping yard standards and would cause a disaster in high winds.

But no, he got praised and invited back. Ridiculous."
Pocoyo,The safety record is terrible too
Pocoyo,"My wife loves Octonauts......when my kid (female) was four to six she loved it as well....because of the cat, Kwazii (a headstrong troublemaker).

Bubble guppies is also quite educational.

"
Pocoyo,"Thomas the *Train*? Is this an American thing, because *tank engine* isn't as marketable?"
Pocoyo,YouTube an episode and see what the fuss is about. 
Pocoyo,That red train is a poster child for ADHD meds.  Get your shit together red train 
Pocoyo,Who is John Galt?
Pocoyo,[deleted]
Pocoyo,"Also Daniel Tiger (I don't know what's up with O the Owl, but whatever) and Wallykazam."
Pocoyo,A strange world where all the women wear pillowcase dresses and all the men wear leotards.
Pocoyo,The show where everyone's head is a penis and scrotum. 
Pocoyo,"I'm now sat here with it going round my head, thanks OP.

Chuuuuggington. Chugga-chugga-chugga-chugga-chuggington."
Pocoyo,PBS Kids still has a great selection of cartoons
Pocoyo,Kids like animals way way better than human characters.
Pocoyo,"dear god yes, I HATE those those stupid ass bunny's. They do bad shit and never get in trouble. Terrible, terrible show."
Pocoyo,Arrogant little bastard.
Pocoyo,"Why'd you throw Spongebob in there at the end? Almost every episode was about was about waht an annoying little fuck-up asshole Spongebob was. He was just a dick to his artist neighbor and coworker all the time and at times, it got super-frustrating to watch. "
Pocoyo,"I like how you have fallen into the Berenstein trap for Berenstain. Another example of how the universe has shifted as in the Matrix.  Edit: There is a huge section of online folks who insist that its always been Berenstein, and that there was some matrix like shift to alter alll the books to read ""Berenstain."" Amusing to read about. http://woodbetweenworlds.blogspot.com/2012/08/the-berenstein-bears-we-are-living-in.html?m=1"
Pocoyo,That's right. When our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ comes down on the Day of Judgment with many flaming swords of death and justice-- then them darn trains will learn!
Pocoyo,"I'm a nanny and I was interviewing with a family one time when the discussion of children's TV came up. The dad says, ""we *hate* Caillou."" The mom gives him a scolding look and says, ""we don't say that word."" The dad looks all sheepish and says, ""sorry. We *hate* that little bald kid."""
Pocoyo,We have a no tolerance policy on whining in our house. Caillou is permanently banned. The great thing is my kids know why and agree with it. They tell other kids it's not allowed because Caillou is a whiner. Small victories man.
Pocoyo,Plot twist: Caillou grew up to be Justin Bieber.
Pocoyo,Wasn't that Shining Time Station (Thomas the Tank Engine)?
Pocoyo,"The show is called Thomas & Friends but he's still Thomas the Tank Engine. A lot of (American, I guess) folks tend to call him ""Thomas the Train"" or ""Thomas Train"" for whatever reason."
Pocoyo,I'm American and I've always referred to him as Thomas the tank engine. 
Pocoyo,"I like umizoomi...i mean my kids like it. Yeah, that's it. "
Pocoyo,It's a beautiful day in the neighborhood.
Pocoyo,"I previewed an episode where Spongebob cried nearly the entire show.  I vowed that my son would never watch a single episode, and so far he hasn't.  My son grew out of Chuggington, thankfully.  I found that the trains never really solved problems very well, for the most part.  There are some exceptions, but mainly I think they use mistakes and deceptions to create drama to entertain children instead of being truly educational, like Dora the Explorer, The SuperReaders of SuperWhy or Paw Patrol.  Chuggington is not my least favorite though.  That dishonor falls to Fireman Sam, where they have a firebug named Norman who lights the town on fire in nearly every episode, and yet everyone seems to have amnesia about it.  He even cheats at a race in one episode.  The Norman character should be in a detention facility, evaluated, tried as an adult, and put into a mental hospital for the criminally insane."
Pocoyo,Sponge-Bob can be pretty damn funny at times. Also most kids need to be over five to like it.
Pocoyo,". . . You know, I think I knew this back when I was a kid. Not the parallel universe thing because fuck me that blew my mind and I think I have a new religion now, but like, it being spelled Berenstain rather than Berenstein. Because as a kid, I'm not gonna lie, I was a DANK speller. I still am. So when I found out that the ""stein"" was supposed to be ""stain"" I basically had my existential crisis right there at 7 years old. 

But christ, if that doesn't put everything into perspective, I dunno what does. Praise be with Berenstein, where the world makes more sense."
Pocoyo,"My favorite story was from Reddit:

At a daycare, they showed Caillou. The kids started misbehaving and whining and complaining. It continued got worse for about a couple weeks. A teacher realized the kids were imitating Caillou, and stopped letting them watch it. They quickly returned to normal and stopped whining so much.

Can you believe a *popular* show exists that teaches kids to be whiny little brats?"
Pocoyo,"Yeah it's Thomas the tank where they brick up the engine. I think he requests it though. Shit man that just flung me back almost 30 years.

And I've just flung you back 8 years (assuming you still Reddit, under this account.)"
Pocoyo,"We also call Sir Toppum Hat ""The Fat Controller"" in the UK"
Pocoyo,"Okay. When I was growing up, the title card always said Thomas the Tank Engine. I think I have flicked past to see it's now Thomas & Friends."
Pocoyo,It just doesn't feel right to have him called that
Pocoyo,"Let your son watch seasons 1 to 3 of spongebob, everything after that, never let him see. Unfortunately the shows quality has fallen REALLY hard since 2004. I would recommend every child seeing those seasons only."
Pocoyo,I always felt like Fireman Sam should have a much larger role in the day to day management of Pontypandy.  He should be mayor or something more than than solely a fireman.  From what I can Sam and the chick firefighter (i want to say her name is Penny) are the only competent people in the town.
Pocoyo,"I like Spongebob but if you wanna talk about how cartoons were more logical or less annoying in the '90s, Spongebob is a poor case in that point. He isn't always an annoying little shit but he often is and there's no denying that. It's kinda a point of the show. "
Pocoyo,The way people go on and on I can't help but think my kids are the only ones in the world who are capable of watching this show regularly without turning into whining monsters. 
Pocoyo,The first few episodes I saw growing up here in the U.S. he was called The Fat Controller.
Pocoyo,"He's both, surely. "
Pocoyo,What is this !!!! What?
Pocoyo,"Thanks for the heads up.
I have found *lots* of educatainment content for children without resorting to Spongebob or the Purple Dinosaur or the annoying Veggie Tales.
We avoid violent content like Rescue Bots and Mutant Ninja Turtles as well.
"
Pocoyo,"Agreed.
The complete nitwit fire commissioner should have been jailed for incompetence.
I think that Sam should have held a town meeting and asked the town to lock up Norman, and his Mum.  Then the town would be safe from fire at least, and could then concentrate on the fisherman and lighthouse keeper who were constantly falling overboard or off their lighthouse tower, and also concentrate on all the fools who went up a ladder and then got stuck on a tile roof somewhere.  The whole show is how *not* to be safe, including the folks who fight fires, save for Sam, the only competent person in the entire town."
Pocoyo,When they pass through the fire they will be consumed or become stronger for having survived.
Pocoyo,"I watched Recess and did not turn into a sneaky, resourceful elementary school kid who treated the playground like a POW camp."
Pocoyo,"That is because in the US, it was realised that they could hardly call him the ""average-sized controller""... So his real name was used in the american accent dubbed versions"
Pocoyo,American accent versions? I thought they were the same narrators in both the U.S. and the U.K.
Pocoyo,"If its not narrated by Ringo Starr, then it's not real Thomas The Tank Engine, IMO.

Source: Old school British Thomas fanatic."
Pocoyo,"No, the later movies and later episodes all have different narrators for US and UK versions, especially annoying for me, because my son has all the movie DVDs and a lot of the TV show DVDs, but, i also pirated the same movies/episodes of the DVDs we have (for the NAS, for convenience), and a lot of them have different narrators to the ones we own, with awful american accents.

There are a few shows that do it, one we have noticed recently because he has started watching it is ""Paw Patrol"", all the dogs and the kid, are all american all the way through season 1, then in season 2, English accent, but if i pirate it, american accent."
Pocoyo,"I haven't seen any new Thomas, all I know is that it's all CGI now and looks ""meh""."

The Originals,she's a lead character.
The Originals,"She has a good amount of screen time. However, season 5 of The Originals is terrible. Total snoregasm. I wouldn't bother watching. Maybe just watch her scenes on YouTube."
The Originals,"> she's a lead character.

Copy that. Thank you."
The Originals,"> She has a good amount of screen time

Copy that. Thanks.

>However, season 5 of The Originals is terrible. Total snoregasm

Well since I have not watched seasons 1 - 4 I really don't care about what's going on other then just her just like I don't care at all about the vampires in Legacies so I'll just be fast forwarding a lot. Library DVDs.

> Maybe just watch her scenes on YouTube.

I just checked youtube and did not really see that. I searched for ""the originals season 5 Danielle Rose Russell"" https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=the+originals+season+5+Danielle+Rose+Russell"
The Originals,Just FYI I believe the Netflix Sabrina show is drawing inspiration from the 2014 comic which was critically and commercially successful.
The Originals,"Sabrina is an extremely old Archie comics series, it didn't start with the sitcom. Archie has also had several different kinds of reboots over the years including ones grittier than Riverdale like Afterlife with Archie written by the creator of Riverdale. These two shows were obviously written to be Archie and Sabrina shows, the IP wasn't just slapped on like you are suggesting."
The Originals,">Is anyone actually happy with these adaptations of the franchises?

The IP owners."
The Originals,"> both of which were obviously originally written as completely separate scripts and later adapted to use the name of well known series/ franchises

Not even close. The developer of those shows was a Marvel Comics writer who did a comic about Archie in a zombie apocalypse that led to him being named the CCO of Archie Comics. He developed Riverdale based on his ideas about how Archie should be and then wrote the Sabrina comic that serves as the basis for the Netflix show."
The Originals,[deleted]
The Originals,I've always thought they should have gone more grounded and earnest with Riverdale. Something closer to Friday Night Lights.
The Originals,">  Archie was never like Riverdale and had a completely different tone and themes, so why make the TV adaptation a gritty teen drama mystery?

Archie has done all types of crazy stuff though, look up ""Afterlife with Archie""."
The Originals,Star... Trek...
The Originals,"Your problem is that you are unaware of the source material.  You are only aware of Archie as the funny comic at checkout stands.  And of Sabrina as the same kind of funny comic or the old sitcom.  But there are many comics about Archie and Sabrina with different themes.  Riverdale and Sabrina are based on comics - just not comics you are familiar with.

I have this problem with the MCU.  I read comics in the 70's and 80's.  Hawkeye to me is a former circus sharpshooter, not a Shield assassin.  It is not that the MCU is not based on comics, it is that it is based on comics that I am unfamiliar with.  So it feels wrong to me."
The Originals,Nancy Drew is about ghosts now.
The Originals,">I guess I'm just wondering if anyone has some reason why this trend happened and is popular.

There's a decades-long trend to move away from ""original"" content and toward ""exploitation of intellectual property"" in fimed media (see how almost every big budget movie is either an adaptation of a franchise from another medium, or a sequel).

I wouldn't be surprised if part of the appeal of these shows to the studios is as a compromise between ""original"" content and exploitation of IP.

In TV you are recently seeing more of this IP-based approach (a lot of revivals; movies turned into season-long shows)."
The Originals,Because it's not 1995 anymore.
The Originals,"While both your examples are awful shows, I'm pretty sure they started from the ground up as the things they were always meant to be."
The Originals,Modern TV shows aren't allowed to be fun and heartfelt. Everything must be dull and dreary and dark and edgy and depressing and full of death and misfortune.
The Originals,"They make them too PC and inexplicably assume people want to see a reboot of Married With Children, but with FEMINISM"
The Originals,"But wouldn't it be better if they just kept with the original script they had in the first place? I'd rather see all new IP, instead they place all sorts of constraints on themselves by trying to force it into an existing franchise"
The Originals,The Originals
The Originals,"Definitely the witches, they were the original supernaturals and they created the rest"
The Originals,I think Silas was supposed to be the baddest of all but didn't really get that in the end. So definitely The Originals (especially in TVD)
The Originals,"Klaus/Mikaelsons

They killed a disgusting amount of people."
The Originals,"Stephen, when he turns off his humanity has to be the absolute baddest baddie."
The Originals,"No faction can beat them. 

Always and forever ❤️"
The Originals,Yeah that first time when Bonnie’s grandma put Damon in his place at her doorstep gave me an instant nerd boner. I love the paper/rock/scissors balance of the factions on the show.
The Originals,"I mean they were so good in TVD that they got their own show

Klaus especially"
The Originals," Hope, she is a werewolf vampire witch.  It's like someone tried to make a plot generator for young adult novels and the script code exploded. "
The Originals,Wait... so this is a spin-off of a spin-off then?
The Originals,"I won't watch it when it's on TV, but I'll probably binge it when the season's over. "
The Originals,"If Julie Plec wasn’t involved I’d say this show would’ve stood a chance.

But we know it’s just gonna be the same bullshit of love stories first, fan service second, majority of screen time for whichever dude she has a lady boner for third, erasing the mythology again fourth and maybe, if we’re really lucky....MAYBE we’ll get a bit of story fifth. 

This show might make a good drinking game - take a shot every time you roll your eyes and shout “This is bullshit!”"
The Originals,i grew up on TVD and am still watching TO (even if the quality dropped heavily in the last 24 months). I didn't plan to watch it at all but the trailer looks interesting. I will give it a try 
The Originals,CW shows really overplay the narration. 
The Originals,"Twilight meets X-Men, but its worse."
The Originals,"It is just the natural result of a show going on far too long for its own good.

Originals is just the Vampire Diaries cast getting so big they needed their own show whilst the original cast kept going. And this is the same thing happening to Originals.

It's basically like Vampire Diaries season 14 or something. Eventually every character has had a relationship with another and you get all kind of crazy supernatural combo kids."
The Originals,"Yusuf is great in The Originals, looking forward to see him in Good Omens. "
The Originals,I want to see Yusuf in as many shows and movies as possible. He was phenomenal in The Originals.

The Originals,Mireilles Enos is fucking awesome! i very much liked Yusuf on THE ORIGINALS (back when i watched it) too!  can't wait for GOOD OMENS! it sounds really interesting! 
The Originals,"Excited to see how things will go. I  pictured a red haired Hayley Atwell while listening to the book, but so far the casting has been great and it is great having Gaiman very much involved with the project. "
The Originals,"it was originally just ""crawley"""
The Originals,Back when he was tempting people to eat apples.
The Originals,"I liked the first season of the show, however I found the second season to be not particularly interesting, honestly. Does it get better, or is it only downhill after S2?"
The Originals,"I'll miss it, I always enjoyed it more than its parent series. "
The Originals,"For the best, I feel like season 4 wrapped things up for a lot of stuff and the writers have a bad habit of two steps forward, one step back. "
The Originals,Well they got it syndication ready / Netflix saleable.   I'm surprised it lasted past one series tbh.  
The Originals,this show is pointless
The Originals,Season two was probably the weakest season. Season four benefits from a shorter season.
The Originals,What show isn't? This comment is entirely pointless IMO.
The Originals,because this one is shit
The Originals,"I can respect not liking a show for whatever reason but to just come by and say a show is shit just because you don't like it doesn't make it true. I happen to enjoy the show myself but am relieved that is ending since the quality has declined and I would rather have it end sooner than later but I wouldn't call it shit just because I don't like it. I also don't like Dr. Who but I don't feel like that show is shit either as it for sure has it's audience who enjoys it, which is great. "
The Originals,this comment is shit too
The Originals,[deleted]
The Originals,But... The Tomorrow People?
The Originals,Originals got really good after the first few episodes. 
The Originals,"Reign is great for the wham moments, the pretty people, and the pretty clothes.

Episode to episode, the characters are inconsistent and only remember past events when it is convenient. Still, inside each episode, it's fun people backstabbing and poisoning and plotting against each other.  I liked it in The Tudors and The Borgias, and damned if I don't like it here too."
The Originals,"I'm glad to see Arrow renewed. I've only recently caught up with the show. I've always been a huge superhero/comic book fan, so seeing some of my favorite characters in a TV show has been awesome for me."
The Originals,Yay! I watch all the shows but Reign currently. Glad they all get another season.
The Originals,"so glad Arrow is getting a 3rd season, that show is top notch"
The Originals,[deleted]
The Originals,"im also one of the people who really liked the 1st few seasons and the build up to the whole lucifer armageddon story line. when it finished i was almost sure it couldnt keep its quality and while i really liked it i wished it would end on a high note.

then the next seaon came and i saw myself (and almost everybody else) being proven right.... but i kept watching and am still watching til today. and while i think its really not as good as it once was (with some small exceptions here and there) i accepted it. 

the pressure is gone in a good and a bad way. i wouldn't really recommend the show to anyone anymore because i dont expect that much of it but this also gives me room to enjoy the show for what it is now - a nice little show with inside jokes and a long history. and for the future i just hope the writers can come up with a decent amount of good eps and maybe they even surprise me/us with a great storyline for a whole season.

as long as it doesnt go down completely quality wise i prolly just gonna keep watching. granted - not like i used to before, waiting all week for the ep to come up, but relaxed and hoping for a good episode of this little show i know for so many years.


(sry for the incoherent rambling - just needed to get it out and english isnt my 1st language)"
The Originals,I thought after last season's cliffhanger this would have been the final season.  It started off well but now it seems like its going no where.
The Originals,"I thought it had maybe 1 more season it it but I guess we will see, ratings are up this season and are pretty good and they only really have 2 main characters so that probably helps with cost."
The Originals,">Supernatural  
>science fiction

A what now? Yeah, just let it die already.
"
The Originals,It is on the bubble. It has the best ratings of the not yet renewed shows but that might be because of its lead in. later this year they will move its night to see how it does without Arrow. If it doesn't lose too many people it will likely be renewed.
The Originals,Is it officially not getting renewed? 
The Originals,"I still recommend it to people, well at least the first 5 seasons. "
The Originals,The showrunner said they were hoping for one more season so that they could use it to conclude the show properly.
The Originals,"Besides season 6 it's never been actually bad. Even season 6 had some pretty good episodes.

It's not great anymore but it certainly isn't bad."
The Originals,"Yeah, they'll probably want to put flash in after arrow to have one dc night so tomorrow people will need a new timeslot."
The Originals,Has it gotten any better? I gave up after a few episodes due to it being terrible pretty much across the board apart from maybe looks. Gave up on Arrow too though I hear that's improved slightly. 
The Originals,"It hasn't been renewed....yet.

This announcement is just the first round of renewal announcements.  More announcements will come later in the year.

It's a good show, that has rapidly found its feet, I can't see them cancelling it."
The Originals,"Yeah. Arrow has pretty good ratings, for the CW, and the shows will likely appeal to the same audience. They already have two shows, Vampire Diaries and the Originals, set in the same world on the same night. Halving a DC night makes sense. They could even make sure they have a crossover of at least one character from Arrow and advertise the show heavily during Arrow especially right before it airs. That would guarantee the most viewers."
The Originals,I enjoy it but it isn't amazing. I really liked that he ended up working for the bad guys in the first episode but I would have liked them to keep some ambiguity in it for a while. Make Ultra seem like it could be a good thing by preventing criminals with powers and have the dark side show over a longer period of time. Conversely making the tomorrow people seem a little suspect would help keep him at Ultra a little longer. But ambiguity is not something network shows usually aim for so they made it too black and white. 
The Originals,"And if the hourman pilot gets a series order, they might want another dc show to air along with it and with the introduction of the suicide squad on arrow, it might just be a suicide squad show."
The Originals,"I've actually never heard of Hourman. I'll have to look out for that. With all theses DC shows I'm going to be watching more CW than ever. I really wish that they had decided to make a show based on The Hollows by Kim Harrison a few years ago. I would be watching them even more.
"
The Originals,"I never watched the original and I'm watching the new one without any issues. Starting off I knew who mulder and scully were, and that they investigated the paranormal, didn't take much more than that to settle in!"
The Originals,Tonight's episode is supposed to be great (and completely unconnected to the series as a whole) so it would probably be a great jumping in point.
The Originals,"They have made passing reference to a few things, but I think you basically can. Most of the giant plotlines have been ignored/wrapped up. The big thing right now is that ""it was all a lie!"" Which is ridiculous, but you can pop in and not be too lost."
The Originals,I'd say they do a good job of filling you in right away. They also sort of reboot the thing anyway. I liked it. 
The Originals,I can either watch these new 6 episodes or watch 9 full seasons on Netflix which will take me weeks. 
The Originals,The first 10 minutes of the first episode gets you up to speed.
The Originals,"I won't stick about to read the comments as I have never watched X-Files before, but in light of the reboot and the fact that I've recently really got in to tv and sci-fi is my favourite genre, I'm watching for the first time. I was enjoying the first few episodes anyway, but idk since hitting episode 11 (Eve) it's like the show got 3x as good. So I def recommend watching from the beginning!"
The Originals,"You could watch the new season without having watch the others, BUT you will completely have missed out on the character development. If you don't want to watch ALL of the previous seasons and episodes, here are the [essentials](https://trakt.tv/users/travisg100/lists/the-essential-x-files-episodes). I got caught up over the last couple months and it was definitely worth it!"
The Originals,"Its called ""Season 10"" for a reason.  You should start at the beginning. "
The Originals,no watch the show in netflix
The Originals,The theme that governments and large corporations and shadowy rich people controlling things behind the scenes with science and special technology has become so generic since X-Files first came out that the themes don't really need to be introduced with lengthy exposition. The tldr is governments and corporations are bad. That's an easy thing to understand.
The Originals,"I'm watching it now, They sum it up pretty nicely in the first few minutes of episode 1. If you understand the general premise of the show, you should be ok."
The Originals,"I loved the show, never watched it since it originally aired and stopped watching when Mulder left. So have no idea how it ended.

I jumped in and loving it. You probably won't get the same nostalgia boner for the first episode which probably makes it seem better than it was. However I don't see how you couldn't jump in if you know the most basic premise of the show."
The Originals,"I watched the original series, and the main difference I see is that the reprisal seems to be much more tongue-in-cheek — sort of an ""*X-Files* meets *Airplane*, or *Police Academy*"" For me, the jury's still out. I'll have to give it a couple more episodes before coming to a verdict."
The Originals,And it was! All hail Darin Morgan!
The Originals,I thought it got even better in Season 2.
The Originals,Yay! I'm nearly finished with the first season.
The Originals,Oh it definitely gets better in season 2. The season 1 finale is great.
The Originals,"Honestly you could watch “The Originals” without TVD but watching how the originals became popular is more rewarding but also frustrating cuz you’ll end up loving Klaus, Rebekah, Elijah, Kol and Finn (kinda) and the spin-off goes into a whole other direction lol"
The Originals,I’d watch it. You’ll see how ruthless klaus was in TVD. He made me cry but now I love him. You’ll also see more sides of his siblings like Rebecca 
The Originals,"Definitely the first two or three seasons, everyone deserves to see Elijah's entrance into the show. "
The Originals,"I'd recommend it. The first four seasons (and sixth) are fantastic and the series finale is perfect, especially when compared to the Originals. As far as the ""teen romance with vampires"" aspect there isn't really much I can say, yeah the plot does kick off cause of a romance but there's a lot of other really interesting stuff going on too."
The Originals,TVD is more teen romance. IMO seasons 1-3 are great while the last 5 went downhill.
Chefs Table,"I kinda want to know more about the ""You are going to die unless you stop making pizza"" bit. Rough quote, I know.

I spent my Summer watching all of MasterChef and MasterChef Junior because I am pathetic, and this looks pretty interesting."
Chefs Table,Gonna be watching this while eating Domino's.
Chefs Table,"I watched this last night. Not to knock Chef Bianco, surely his pizza is amazing and has inspired thousand's of pizza makers all over Europe and the USA, this Neapolitan artisan style is now widespread and to be honest, has gotten a bit gentrified and boring. I eat this stuff all the time now, of course better than some shitty train station pizza slice, but I have also had some pretty fucking good pizza from places that don't have a wood oven, hand squeezed tomato sauce, perfectly mixed and proofed 00 dough and new york mozzarella. Just some mom and pop love on the back streets of Italy with a fuck load of cheese and fennel sausage."
Chefs Table,"I’m watching this right now. Chef’s Table is so pretentious, and that’s coming from someone who loves pretentious food. Like do we need the classical music intro and 100 slow motion shots of the chefs smelling a tomato on an organic farm?"
Chefs Table,"How could it ever compete with the Hulu show though? (/s)

https://reddit.com/r/television/comments/wxnayr/best_in_dough_official_trailer_from_the_creators/"
Chefs Table,Chefs table pizza: we travel around the world to bake the fun out of pizza.
Chefs Table,"Awesome. They made a whole show about pizza and skipped the most important pizza city in the world, and only did one style more or less."
Chefs Table,"What we need is a Jon Stewart documentary about Pizza, where he spends the last 10 minutes going into vivid comedic details into why Chicago Deep Dish is the worst thing ever. 

https://youtu.be/jCgYMFtxUUw"
Chefs Table,"Really wish they would have featured an NY spot like L&B's Spumoni, a Detroit style joint, something unique"
Chefs Table,"My guess it would be the fumes from the wood oven, I think on those kind of wood burning ovens, the only place for air to escape is through the front entry."
Chefs Table,“The best pizza is in the alleys of Italy 🥱” *flips hair* *adjusts Gucci sunglasses*
Chefs Table,Chef's Table is good for flipping through to various food and scenery highlights.
Chefs Table,">Chef's Table: Pizza

This one has chef's xd"
Chefs Table,We travel around the world and show different people in fields of wheat.
Chefs Table,We can argue if deep dish is not pizza but deep dish is fucken delicious.
Chefs Table,"You are required to have the same venting just like any oven. Commercial ones require the same, or you will be fined, and cannot open."
Chefs Table,"That is your own quote. Some things just shouldn't be gentrified. Pizza is not meant to be gourmet, it is street food... People like Bianco's for two reasons, 1) they source high quality ingredients, 2) The have to queue all morning"
Chefs Table,Yeah it’s a pretty show that’s for sure
Chefs Table,"I mean I agree with you, but the whole concept of Chef’s Table is taking something and making it gourmet. Idk what annoyed me about your comment is that you’re saying pizza should be ungentrified street food but you’re still making a judgement call as to what’s good or bad street food (Mom and Pop shops in Italy are good but train station food is bad). 

Doesn’t ungentrified just mean a poor urban area? Like poor people today are gonna eat the cheap shit pizza at the train station because it’s cheap and convenient. Also homeless people in NY go to $1 slice places because …it’s cheap. So we should eat food of the working class if it’s 19th-c working class but not the 21st c working class?

I think this show is guilty of overly romanticizing the past, and of how people used to eat. I really doubt poor 19th c Italians were eating Bianco-style pizzas. Also there were waves of immigration to the US because people wanted to get tf out of Italy. 

Anyways just a few thoughts"
Chefs Table,"well pizza in Italy used to be just flat bread... wasn't until Italians went to America that they turned it into some gooey mess. that was exported around the world. Just saying I have had great, if not better pizza in Italy and America than this new style pizza they have everywhere now. And by train station I meant like frozen pizza dough, ingredients etc, baked next to kebabs and asian noodles."
Chefs Table,Yeah true true
Chefs Table,Oh my gosh…. That would be so scary. I can hear Mads say….. try the liver…. It’s fresh.
Chefs Table,"Fans will put Vivaldi's Four Seasons (Concerto No. 4 in F minor) over *anything* to put together a *Chef's Table* parody trailer of their own. Youtube is littered with them.

Just me, but while it's an okay idea, I'm all \[shrug\]. The [original rolodex/recipe box montage of Hannibal cooking to *Faust*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx89rSN0I28) was just **so** much better."
Chefs Table,"Lol what? You missed the point of the video altogether. Hannibal always featured beautiful cooking sequences, so this person edited together a fake Chef's Table intro for Hannibal. The link you posted is just a random scene from Hannibal. Also, yes Concerto No. 4 in F minor is literally used as the Chef's Table intro song."
Chefs Table,"Oh, no I got the point. It just wasn't nearly as funny, pointed, or smart as the other *Chef's Table* parodies like that that abound on Youtube:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-lfBiatGD8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-lfBiatGD8)

Using *Hannibal* footage? While the *original* footage is actually far more on-point than the parody? It's just dumb."
Chefs Table,"Best Netflix docu-series, and it ain’t even close, IMO"
Chefs Table,"Chef's Table is my favorite cooking show, will be looking forward to this."
Chefs Table,"This is such a fun series. Really beautiful style, and glad they're going a bit of a focused direction with BBQ here as I loved the pastry one.

[For those that haven't seen it, IFC's Documentary Now! did a great parody episode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47j9jWMegUs) as well, super funny."
Chefs Table,"Premieres September 2nd, for those unable to watch."
Chefs Table,I fucking love this show
Chefs Table,I once saw this food series on BBQ.  It went to the best places in the US.  A lot of them were in my neck of the woods but the one that stood out was in Cali.  This couple was from KC but moved to Cali.  They got a small hut at the farmers market.  The line is so long people don't even get to eat before they run out of food.  It made me realise that a lot of states don't have good BBQ.  It's sort of sad really.
Chefs Table,Omg. I picked a damn good time finally dig in to this series. Just in time for this one!
Chefs Table,Looks like the most interesting one they have done of these.
Chefs Table,I love all the food docuseries to be honest. They're great
Chefs Table,"It was actually a parody of Jiro Dreams of Sushi, an earlier work by the creator of Chef's Table, but I still loved it, the way they parodied the father/son dynamic of the original movie was great"
Chefs Table,David Gelb has been amazing for Netflix
Chefs Table,Ahh that makes sense too. I always figured Jiro Dreams of Sushi was the inspiration for a lot of the later food docs on Netflix.
Chefs Table,"Ugly Delicious is great as well. And Salt Fat Acid Heat.  Also Cooked, as has already been mentioned. Netflix has some fantastic food shows."
Chefs Table,Add Jon Favreau food truck show to the list. All of these shows are food porn at its best
Chefs Table,Ugly delicious is also quite good. The first episode is the worst of the series so you might not want to start with that one.
Chefs Table,"Chefs table has a lot of great cinematography, but I wish it focused more on the food and less on how hard the chefs life has been.

I don't particularly care about how you grew up poor, but I am interested to understand and watch your process for creating and serving amazing food."
Chefs Table,"It also helps that Netflix is streaming those shows in 4K HDR. If you own a good TV, the food just looks awesome."
Chefs Table,"""Cooked"" is fantastic too. You should add that to your list of you haven't watched it yet"
Chefs Table,Agree! 100%
Chefs Table,David Gelb is behind both. He also did a pretty famous documentary called Jiro Dreams of Sushi (also on Netflix). It's great if you haven't seen it.
Chefs Table,"My favorites so far have been Ugly Delicious (stoked for a new season) and also Somebody Feed Phil. I actually got to use one of Phil’s suggestions, which is the first time I’ve ever been to a place I only saw on a TV Show."
Chefs Table,Was about to upvote you for Ugly Delicious but I thought SFAH was absolute trash.
Chefs Table,I found the fried chicken episode the worst - very cringy and overbearing especially if you aren't American.
Chefs Table,"I don't like Chef's Table anymore to be honest. It used to focus on demystifying the cult of technical, Michelin star cooking with chefs as rock stars and food as a challenge. I thought it was brilliant, engaging and insightful.

But to me it only really works with that kind of restaurant and cuisine. I just don't find the more rustic food and cooks they focus on now really worth spending time dissecting, which is probably why they now pad it out with life stories when they used to shine a light almost exclusively on the food with the chef's journey being complimentary to this."
Chefs Table,I've seen it on there but I haven't checked it out yet. Will do for sure though.
Chefs Table,I have seen that one actually. It's a really good film.
Chefs Table,"This is my favorite docu-series on Netflix, can't wait to watch it

Wish it was more than a 4 episode season though"
Chefs Table,"Pretty amazing parody of chef's table 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vcLzu5_Yb8"
Chefs Table,I love this series. Super excited for this.
Chefs Table,I can’t sleep and this gives me joy 
Chefs Table,"The shots look amazing, but take it down a notch with pretentiousness please, you are making food not saving the world."
Chefs Table,"Alright, I've had this on my watch list for a while now. I'm a big fan of Parts Unknown/No Reservations. I kinda watched the first episode, but had to go to work and never went back. Is it a show along the lies of the two that I mentioned or is a bit different? "
Chefs Table,"The first series and in fact the first episode is still the best.

There are a lot of pretentious chefs on the later episodes."
Chefs Table,"Oh thank goodness, this looks great. The Pastry ""season,"" if you'd call it that, was such a step down in quality I was worried it spoke to the future of the show, but it seems like that was likely an entirely different crew. This looks like more of what made the first three years so good. "
Chefs Table,This show has gotten more and more pretentious with each season.  
Chefs Table,"There are a few funny parodies, but [this one's](https://youtu.be/9kGtgBJKyZM) my personal favourite. "
Chefs Table,"It's become a real turn off for me especially when the similar personality is so widespread. There's a lot to admire about their work and talent but for an entertainment series, it can sometimes come across pretty grating. Even on wholesome down to earth cooking shows it sticks out like a sore thumb. For example in Somebody Feed Phil, that chef who gets annoyed when people don't eat oysters properly, or Daniel Boulud insisting his sauce makes the mom's dish better. Or that guy in Ugly Delicious saying tacos are cultural appropriation. Chefs who are pretty down to earth or just as knowledgeable comes across pretty well on camera, like Narda Comedor or Christina Tosi and Carla and rest of the Bon Appetit editors. 

I think that's where the Great British Bake Off, Somebody Feed Phil and Nailed It gets their appeal. It's refreshing to see people who just enioys cooking and eating and just there for the fun of it. "
Chefs Table,Not really. Parts Unknown is more about the culture. Chef Table is really about the chef and the food. 
Chefs Table,The biggest similarity is that both shows revolve around food in some way or another - Bourdain looks at food in the context of a city whereas Chef's Table looks at food in the context of a chef.  Chef's Table is definitely more theatrical in comparison.
Chefs Table,"This series is basically a documentary of the life of the chef, their food, and what they love about their art. Parts unknown is more about the people and the culture around cuisine, not necessarily about the chef. "
Chefs Table,What!? The pastry season was amazing. Jordi Roca’s episode was one of the best of the entire series. I don’t think the quality dropped at all. Every episode was shot beautifully. I think it fits in with every other season. 
Chefs Table,"I've never seen that one, but it is so dead on. 

My favorite, hands down, will always and forever be this one with the great Fred Armisen. https://www.eater.com/2017/2/28/14765040/portlandia-chefs-table

Sorry for the formatting, etc!"
Chefs Table,"To each their own. I found the visual flair to be lacking, and I've heard similar things from other viewers, though it's far from categorical. Felt like it was put together more quickly while they were working on the next ""real"" season."
Chefs Table,Chef's Table is the shiitttttt. So glad there's finally going to be more and for pastries! Sucks that it's only 4 episodes but it will be a nice snack 
Chefs Table,I wouldnt have thought they would do a  series on pastry. I wonder if they are going to follow the Michelin ranked restaurants. 
Chefs Table,This made me smile! Chef’s Table is the best! 🙌🏼
Chefs Table,"Really excited. 
Potentially unpopular opinion but I think Tosi's work tends to be cloyingly sweet and almost childish. That being said I'll watch the duck out of each episode happily. "
Chefs Table,"God, I love Chef's Table.  Back when it was just the original six episodes I was sick and having a blah day full of boredom, I ended up scrolling through Netflix and my love of cooking shows made me decide to give it a go.  I ended up watching all six episodes that day.  There is just something so wonderful about the way this show is presented, like a mini-biography that's just beautifully shot. 

I can not wait for this instalment."
Chefs Table,Chef's Table is one of the best food shows. 
Chefs Table,"Man I hate this show. I like how Netflix also has the show ""Ugly Delicious"" with David Chang where they make fun of these types of food videos. "
Chefs Table,"I love how each episode is a mini documentary, with a different story and each shot in a different style depending on the chef. It’s not some stale documentary. Great show. "
Chefs Table,That's not really what ugly delicious is doing at all...
Chefs Table,Yay! Those chefs are all so nutty in so many different ways
Chefs Table,Excellent.  I love this docu-series.
Chefs Table,"Happy to learn that. This show made me understand gastronomy and haute couture, plus it's so nicely shot."
Chefs Table,With the first episode I was a fan of the show 
Chefs Table,"I liked the first 3 episodes, but the last episodes were just not interesting.  I would watch some more though. "
Chefs Table,I'm not really big on food but I love all the videography - makes me wish I was into food more
Chefs Table,So pumped for Sean Brock!
Chefs Table,The last season of this show was so amazing. The one about El Bulli and Albert Adria was amazing
Chefs Table,"I still enjoy it quite a bit, but to me the photography has taken a pretty substantial step back. Most of the beautiful, slow tracking shots, the slow mo, the focus on nuanced skill and hand movements, is gone. 

I also think the increased ""focus"" has, in many ways, missed the point of the previous seasons, where each episode had such a distinct feel and tone based on the chef being featured. These episodes, meanwhile, blend together a little, and much of that sense of a chef's identity being on display has been pulled back. It's gone from being a distillation of a chef's voice and story to, instead, just an interview."
Chefs Table,"This isn't the same show where they highlight a different chef every episode, is it?  I really enjoyed that one and was wondering when they'd put a new season out. "
Chefs Table,"I was so excited for this to be released (as an avid fan of pastries, of course) so I'm hoping I enjoy it. But your review has me a little concerned..."
Chefs Table,"I don't really care for Christina Tosi based on what I have seen of her as a judge on MasterChef. This episode helped me like her a tiny bit more but I have to say I still don't get her huge success. Cereal flavored milk, birthday cake with fruity pebbles, cornflake pie? To me that is not anywhere close on the same level of the other elite pasty chefs that were featured.

For the Jordi Roca episode, the audio track threw me off at first. It sounded like it was dubbed. I remember seeing El Celler de can Roca a few years back on MasterChef Professionals UK and was thrilled to see it again. What an incredible place."
Chefs Table,"It is! They just put out a new season (albeit, 4 episodes) last week. "
Chefs Table,"I loved it, for what it's worth. I thought the stories they told were great, but that's just me."
Chefs Table,"That episode defaults to dubbed Latin American Spanish, the original is Spain Spanish and is one of the available audio tracks. It's fucking bizarre that it defaults to a dubbed Spanish track when it's actually in Spanish"
Chefs Table,[deleted]
Chefs Table,This is the fourth season 
Chefs Table,"YES! 
The passion and appreciation for food in this is on another level! "
Chefs Table,"Really excited for this. I don't cook and I don't watch cooking shows, but this series is special and deals with some very extraordinary people. Can't wait!"
Chefs Table,"I am beyond excited for this! The first season was so amazing. So much inspiration, food porn, and knowledge. Can't wait for more. "
Chefs Table,"Fuck yes!!! So so excited, absolutely loved the first season, can't wait! "
Chefs Table,This should really be upvoted more!  First season was incredible (most notably the guy from New York with the farm ... his name escapes me atm).  Second season looks to continue the brilliance that is Chef's Table!
Chefs Table,"I've seen so many homemade videos of Alinea's tablecloth dessert. I find it a bit ridiculous, but will acknowledge the creativity of it. Cant wait to watch the chocolate balls crack in slow-mo with an orchestral cymbal crashing in sync with it."
Russell Peters vs. the World,It’s the eyebrows.  They’re attack eyebrows.
Russell Peters vs. the World,“It’s a very small universe when I’m angry with you”
Russell Peters vs. the World,"Why do all doctors make such good villains? Matt , David, and now Peter. Great casting all around."
Russell Peters vs. the World,"It and he are very good, I spent all afternoon watching it.

Jessica Raine and Nikesh Patel are also superb.

I'll also add Jessica Raine feels so established yet the only other thing I've seen her in is Line of Duty."
Russell Peters vs. the World,Watching him as Malcolm Tucker taught me this.
Russell Peters vs. the World,Lair of the White Worm is the Peter Capaldi movie we should all be watching this Halloween
Russell Peters vs. the World,That kid from *Local Hero*?
Russell Peters vs. the World,Currently on episode 4 and enjoying it. Raine is so good and liking Patel too.
Russell Peters vs. the World,First I've heard of this show. Knowing Capaldi is in it though is all I need.
Russell Peters vs. the World,I heard about this on Reddit. C'mon Amazon! You can market more than one show
Russell Peters vs. the World,"Of course have to show clip from Thick of it. NSFW language as expected :)

https://youtu.be/6NwvjPlcC3w"
Russell Peters vs. the World,He really is awesome.
Russell Peters vs. the World,I remember seeing him in an alternate music video for Lewis Capaldis “Someone you loved” and I really enjoyed how he could tell the story without saying anything.
Russell Peters vs. the World,"Just finished the show, but I'm not really sure if I'd go out of my way to recommend it.

The acting from everyone is generally great, the editing (for the more 'dreamy' sections especially) is great and even the little amount of action is all well directed. Also want to give a special spotlight for the ominious vibe the soundtrack/sound design gives.

 That said, the pacing makes what plot there is feel *really* drawn out. A big chunk of the show really relies on the mystery. If this is your first rodeo with >!multiple timelines!< shenanigans you may find it interesting, but I've seen it done better in shows that don't feel like a BBC cop drama seems slightly grafted on. There is some interesting thematics at play too but those also don't save it.

Really should've either cut out a episode or two and smeared in some answers along the way, or hell, have potentially made this a movie. 

And for anyone who wants to watch it for Capaldi primarily: Be warned he only gets a few appearances until the second half generally. Or more specifically (minor spoiler) >!5/6 episodes he only gets 1/2 scenes, most of which are flashforwards. The finale is about 80% Capaldi, which is all great and very 12-ish.!<"
Russell Peters vs. the World,I enjoyed his acting on The Torchwood special.  He wasn't a bad Doctor Who either.
Russell Peters vs. the World,Don’t blink!
Russell Peters vs. the World,"Really loved this. Just finished and though the premise/reveal reminds me heavily of >!the first fifteen lives of harry august!<  (do not tap that spoiler if you have not finished!) I greatly enjoyed the mystery, and found the first few episodes really terrifying."
Russell Peters vs. the World,"Spoke with an accent. Irish... Scottish? Same difference. Looks to partner. Partner discreetly shakes his head. 

I got halfway and dropped it. Too long to get to reveal. Not much Capaldi. The lead detective and the guy from Andor. Wanted more of them."
Russell Peters vs. the World,Angry Old Man Get Off My Lawn Doctor is scary now?
Russell Peters vs. the World,You want proof of his terrifying capabilities? He helped get his no talent hack of a cousin Lewis Capaldi a record deal and a singing career. Truly an evil force.
Russell Peters vs. the World,Just a shame he was wasted in The Suicide Squad. Been a fan of his since the Malcolm Tucker days.
Russell Peters vs. the World,Too bad he couldn't salvage the train wreck that is the story in this series.
Russell Peters vs. the World,he usually plays a bad guy on TV. it was only on Dr. Who that I have ever seen him as a good guy. He is scary good at being a bad bad person on tv. To the point that you think he is the devil himself.
Russell Peters vs. the World,"Don't look in that mirror, it's furious !"
Russell Peters vs. the World,Assault eyebrows.
Russell Peters vs. the World,"“If you think because she is dead that I am weak, you understand very little. If you had any part in killing her and are not afraid, you understand nothing at all. So for you own sake, understand this: I’m The Doctor, I’m coming to find you, and I will never ever stop.”"
Russell Peters vs. the World,Thor 2 notwithstanding. (Sorry Chris.)
Russell Peters vs. the World,"The doctor has a lot of elements of ‘The Trickster’ archetype, which works well for villains. 

I also think that it’s just one of those characters that you need to be good at everything to play well. You need to good at being comedic, emotional, intimidating, charismatic, etc. So it attracts very well rounded actors."
Russell Peters vs. the World,Arguably because the doctor is a villain in a way.
Russell Peters vs. the World,"because the Doctor has to have a terrifying streak, which comes out rather frequently. Watch Runaway Bride for some really cold, evil Tennant"
Russell Peters vs. the World,"Same, I haven’t binged anything in a while a this made me binge the whole thing.  Loved the idea behind the show."
Russell Peters vs. the World,Jessica Raine is just incredible to watch.
Russell Peters vs. the World,>!Can only remember her being flung out the window.!<
Russell Peters vs. the World,"I felt that way too, then I realized she was also in Informer."
Russell Peters vs. the World,**YOU SACK OF FUCKING CUM**
Russell Peters vs. the World,"Isaac shouldn't be here, it's a fucking omnishambles."
Russell Peters vs. the World,my household just watched it for the first time last night. Nobody knew anything about it beside some vague idea that it had vampires. We were blown away. What a wild ride that movie is.
Russell Peters vs. the World,"Been on my watch list for years, never realized he was in it gonna have to pull the trigger"
Russell Peters vs. the World,People keep forgetting he was Malcom Tucker first...
Russell Peters vs. the World,Torchwood special?
Russell Peters vs. the World,They actually never met until one of Lewis’ live shows.
Russell Peters vs. the World,"That was his first episode too, wasn’t it?"
Russell Peters vs. the World,"Eccleston was incredible in The Leftovers though for sure.  He deserves his own credit, even if it's not as a villain."
Russell Peters vs. the World,"Chris played the army major in 28 Days Later, he was very good there."
Russell Peters vs. the World,28 Days Later
Russell Peters vs. the World,He actually was a good villain. The story just kinda sucked and didn’t let him actually do much with the role
Russell Peters vs. the World,"Man, I was genuinely excited for him but his character was so poorly written in the movie."
Russell Peters vs. the World,"The Doctor is a fearsome creature, as seen at the end of *Family of Blood*. Even the most fearsome races, including the Daleks, fear him, and for good reason. He can be civil, polite, and even cheerful and jovial, but he is not a nice ""person"".        

One of my favorite moments is when Matt Smith has an alien race look up what happened to every race that opposed him and then tells them to run."
Russell Peters vs. the World,The doctor is clearly not a villain
Russell Peters vs. the World,*listen to me you fucking jazzy bastard*
Russell Peters vs. the World,"Oh no. That was my introduction to him.

That said,  fuckity-bye."
Russell Peters vs. the World,"What a phenomenal show.


https://youtu.be/j8V_TANCjaM"
Russell Peters vs. the World,I believe he was a main character in The Torchwood Children of Earth.  It was a special season.  I should have added more detail.
Russell Peters vs. the World,Who frowned me this face?
Russell Peters vs. the World,How can you forget his role for Gone in 60 seconds :)
Russell Peters vs. the World,Two Boats and a Helicopter is one of my favourite episodes of television ever. Eccleston is so good in the Leftovers.
Russell Peters vs. the World,I’ll give him that one. He was good in it.
Russell Peters vs. the World,">He never raised his voice. That was the worst thing… the fury of the Time Lord… and then we discovered why. Why this Doctor, who had fought with gods and demons, why he had run away from us and hidden. He was being kind…

> Good men don't need rules. Today is not the day to find out why I have so many."
Russell Peters vs. the World,">The doctor is clearly not a villain

The Doctor is a deity. Major or minor is debatable, but tends towards chaotic good..."
Russell Peters vs. the World,"Thats an incredibly homophobic headline, you massive poof"
Russell Peters vs. the World,"Better than the doc, that's for sure."
Russell Peters vs. the World,It is devastating
Russell Peters vs. the World,I’ve seen it. Don’t remember Capaldi. Guess I’ll have to go watch Torchwood again!!
Russell Peters vs. the World,And G.I. Joe and 28 days later
Russell Peters vs. the World,I still giggle when he begs Cage to put the wooden chair down in the middle of trying to kill him
Russell Peters vs. the World,Then big brother takes the fall for the slip-up. It don't matter much to me. One Raines is as good as another. It never rains but it pours.
Russell Peters vs. the World,Just reading the quote i hear it in his voice. Chills
Russell Peters vs. the World,So you think he uses his powers for evil. That's what you're saying?
Russell Peters vs. the World,"the 456 truly the most terrifying villains in the DW universe and probably even broader

I mean alien junkies addicted on chemicals they could only get from human children willing to destroy a planet if they don't get a fix is an incredible concept... and no Doctor in sight to save the children

I'm almost positive some of the ridiculous real world conspiracies about adrenochrome and kidnapping children come from this fucking season"
Russell Peters vs. the World,He was also in The Others as Nicole Kidman’s husband.
Russell Peters vs. the World,"That's not what ""chaotic good"" means."
Russell Peters vs. the World,I wouldn’t count that as a villain role.
Russell Peters vs. the World,"Nope, but you're arguing that the doctor is in someway a villain even though he saves the world and civilizations throughout time on a consistent episodic basis.

This whole argument is nonsense. Plus to go the other route on your argument,  he's not a deity or a god. He's a god like figure. Closer to a fallen angel as his whole mythology (forgetting the Chibnall shite) is about him stealing a tardis and fleeing/being cast aside by the timelord race.

You've only been upvoted for the poncey statement. It in no way supports your argument that the doctor is a villain i.e. evil in some way."
Russell Peters vs. the World,"No, but I like to mention it here and there in case somebody hasn’t seen it in 20 years or so."
Russell Peters vs. the World,"The Doctor generally isn't a villain, but occasionally cleaves close to it. Remember the whole ""Time Lord Victorius"" thing? Or the other times where the only thing to keep him from doing terrible things is his companions. The Doctor has said it many times himself that when he's alone for too long he goes.... wrong.

I also think that you've got me confused with somebody else and you really should double check who you're replying to in the future. But what they said *is* correct. The Doctor is a deity and a terrifying existence--whether he is good or bad; hero or villain, is often down to perspective. Most of the times he comes across as good, but he is always *capable* of doing terrible things."
Russell Peters vs. the World,"I'll try to watch anything with her. 

Hopefully it's good, but description sounds a little unclear."
Russell Peters vs. the World,> *Cocaine Bear* star Keri Russell
Russell Peters vs. the World,"Oh this looks great. She’s fab and I love Rufus Sewell.

Edit: corrected typo as I put Russell Sewell when of course Russell is Keri’s surname…"
Russell Peters vs. the World,"Lol, I mean this is a hilariously specific kind of typecasting to the point that I can’t even be mad at it. *The Americans* was all about how the main characters’ lives as spies informed their strained marriage, and how the uneasy relationship between two countries mirrored that marriage. All you have to do is replace “spy” with “diplomat” and you get this show.

That said Keri Russell is an absolute gem and I will be watching every episode of this. Throwing *The Americans*, *Homeland* and *The West Wing* into a big stew sounds tasty."
Russell Peters vs. the World,She is outstanding - I will give this a try simply because she is in it.
Russell Peters vs. the World,"She's a KGB agent. I can't believe the US government is about to make this mistake. Her husband runs a travel agency, but it's a front."
Russell Peters vs. the World,I’ve been patiently waiting for her next project (that isn’t Cocaine Bear). The Americans is one of the greatest shows I’ve ever seen and she’s a force in it.
Russell Peters vs. the World,"The creator was a writer and producer on Homeland, West Wing and... Grey's Anatomy?"
Russell Peters vs. the World,Dang. Thought it said Kurt for a second but I like Keri too!
Russell Peters vs. the World,This is a long way from _Felicity_.
Russell Peters vs. the World,"She’s fantastic - if it’s anything like her performance in the Americans this will be well worth watching. Keri Russell, Rufus Sewell and Michael McKean is a great line up."
Russell Peters vs. the World,"hell yeah


The next month is gonna be great


Yellowjackets (March 24)

The Diplomat (April 20)


Citadel is a no to maybe (April 28)"
Russell Peters vs. the World,[deleted]
Russell Peters vs. the World,">	“The Diplomat is a show about the transcendence and torture of long-term relationships,” she says. “It’s hard to keep a relationship going, be it a marriage or a military alliance. We change, the world changes, and yet we want these relationships to go on forever. It’s a show about a bunch of good people doing their best to keep their global and personal partnerships intact without killing each other. In the world of diplomacy, you’re dealing with a lot of rule-bound, protocol-driven behavior, but underneath all that, these are people who sweat, and spill coffee on their clothes, and forget the name of the person they’re talking to. All of that is always bubbling under the grandeur and majesty of working with heads of state.”

This really does not sound good lol"
Russell Peters vs. the World,"Kurt Russell swearing would be better, but I'll take it"
Russell Peters vs. the World,I am excited. Hopefully it is good.
Russell Peters vs. the World,So it's a show where she swears a lot?
Russell Peters vs. the World,"Is this similar to Alibi's The Diplomat, starring Sophie Rundle that started in late January?"
Russell Peters vs. the World,KGB officer and spy turned diplomat
Russell Peters vs. the World,I will be there
Russell Peters vs. the World,It sounds like a soap opera tbh.
Russell Peters vs. the World,"for some reason I am feeling like this is going to be like Madam Secretary, but better.


at least I hope.


if it does, that means it'll end with her being the VP, then P"
Russell Peters vs. the World,">I'll try to watch anything with her.

Pretty much where I'm at after The Americans. Guess it's going in the queue!"
Russell Peters vs. the World,">She’s fab and I love Russell Sewell.

Rufus Sewell. And Keri Russell 😅"
Russell Peters vs. the World,"In restaurant terms, *diplomat* is FOH while *spy* is BOH."
Richie Rich,"[Actually the Boston BDC review](http://www.bdcwire.com/binge-watching-netflixs-richie-rich-is-five-hours-i-will-not-get-back/) is hilarious and 10 times better. Contains gems like this:  
**""I don’t want to talk down about child actor Jake Brennan, who plays the titular character, but his smug little child sex robot-lusting face is begging to have a hatchet taken to it.""**
"
Richie Rich,If the criteria for the golden age of something is for the majority of that thing to not be utter crap then nothing has ever had a golden age.
Richie Rich,"To be fair, the original-flavor comic book Rich family had some pretty chintzy taste in wealth-flaunting. "
Richie Rich,The sex robot unsettles me
Richie Rich,"Pretty disappointing, I remember Richie Rich in the 90's and even though the movie was apparently a flop I still absolutely loved it as a kid. Saw Richie Rich pop up on Netflix and was excited to add it to my watch list but them turning it into Nickelodeon/Disney style daytime show kills it for me. "
Richie Rich,"Sex robot?

*reads article*

...I'm not even sure what to think about this (apart from a little voice going ""Oh, it's a Brian Robbins show.  Figures"").  But I think I know how I'm spending my weekend now: binging this mess."
Richie Rich,"Well technically it's ""robot-lusting"", a description of how Richie Rich treats his inexplicably human formed 21 year old French maid robot.  But yeah, I've been watching for signs that the stock of money-losing Netflix is overvalued, and one such sign would be if they are blowing money they don't have on useless crap.  By the way, they're apparently reviving Full House and Degrassi.
"
Richie Rich,"*Degrassi* at least is an ongoing cult hit of sorts for its target audience.  I have no idea in the world why they're bringing *Full House* back, however."
Richie Rich,One could argue Full House has a much greater cult following than Degrassi.
Richie Rich,"It seems like someone in the Netflix development department is playing with Monopoly money.
"
Richie Rich,"...yeah, I'll allow it."
Richie Rich,Can we get Seth Rogen as Professor Keenbean?
Richie Rich,"People are kinda underestimating this one, I think. Netflix is HUGE with kids. Nearly every kid in my family watches Netflix over Disney Channel. It's the sole reason I have to pay for 4 simultaneous streams instead of just 2. I think it is one hell of a smart move for Netflix to add some Netflix originals that are aimed at kids. "
Richie Rich,Wasn't this done before somewhere ?
Richie Rich,Richie Rich is Bruce Wane without the dead parents 
Richie Rich,"What is with turning movies,comics into tv shows?"
Richie Rich,"Really, What next live action Beetle Bailey or Hagrid the Horrible? Maybe they should turn the Wizard of Id to a tv show."
Richie Rich,"it will fail, and be canceled after 6 episodes
"
Richie Rich,Why wouldn't you just make multiple accounts rather then paying for 4 separate accounts. It doesn't make any sense. 
Richie Rich,"There was a film way, way back in 1994.  It was pretty terrible aside from exactly two funny lines in a row."
Richie Rich,... He's just a rich kid. Nothing else is similar to Bruce Wayne haha.
Richie Rich,It's the thang right now. It goes like this: Comics into tv shows > movies > into tv shows.
Richie Rich,"No it won't. It's a netflix original. Nothing has been cancelled before a full season so far. 

"
Richie Rich,I don't pay for 4 accounts. I pay an extra couple of dollars on my single account so it can play 4 streams at once instead of 2.
Richie Rich,Hey I used to love that movie as a kid!
Richie Rich,"He's a comic book character, one that was adapted into a live-action film. That's pretty similar."
Richie Rich,"its a joke about all the current shows getting cancled before the full season airs.
"
Richie Rich,I never even realised that there was a limit
Richie Rich,And I loved A Kid in King Arthur's Court.  Doesn't make it a good film.
Richie Rich,That makes the characters related? That has nothing to do with the characters themselves
Richie Rich,If the movie is made for kids... and kids like it... it kinda does.
Richie Rich,"Looks terrible, but it's not aimed at me so whatever. "
Richie Rich,"Watching the trailer, I couldn't help but think of Wolf of Wall Street...minus the sex and drugs....well maybe. We don't know yet."
Richie Rich,"Just about every version of Richie Rich over the years has been terrible, and I get the feeling that this one will go down the same road."
Richie Rich,"To questions.

Why?

 What Hell Demon did we all piss off for this to exist?"
Richie Rich,"As a 30ish old man, I feel betrayed that this isn't aimed at my demographic.

But seriously, this looks awful but my little siblings will love it."
Richie Rich,tried watching the 1st episode it is so much worse then then Disney channel shows. going to let the kids watch it latter but i do not thing they will like it
Richie Rich,"Wait don't they understand the premise  of Richie Rich.  His family came from wealth but they put family above all else.  He's an only child but has a cousin who thinks of only wealth.   His best friend is Gloria and doesn't come from wealth but they are still the best of friends.  He has the craziest servants and his robot maid protects him, is strong and gets peeved when you mess with the Rich family."
Richie Rich,Terrible? It looks like the worst piece of modern shit I've ever seen.
Richie Rich,what's up with that french maid outfit? wtf. Sexual roleplay so now its just the drugs missing.
Richie Rich,You're 30ish and have younger siblings?
Richie Rich,Yeah under 10.  My father's second marriage.
Richie Rich,*Hears Modern Family theme song*
Richie Rich,"It's much less funny than that show, and that's saying a lot."
Richie Rich,Richie sort looks like a 30 year old lesbian.  
Richie Rich,"Because if there's one character kids today can relate to, it's Richie Rich."
Richie Rich,This kid has a punchable face..I don't know if that's a good thing or a  bad thing for playing a rich kid..
Richie Rich,This looks like some kind of horrific right wing wet dream.
Richie Rich,I bet that's the twist.
Richie Rich,"Kids don't want to relate to the shows they watch. This is straight up wish fulfillment. Even more so than the original, because in this version it's Richie who makes the family rich. "
Richie Rich,"Not relate, project."
Richie Rich,"Yea, at least they're not bringing back that dead kid Casper. "
Richie Rich,"because if there's one character kids today can relate to, the guardians of the galaxy. "
Richie Rich,"i wonder if this feeling is related to what /u/kidlatham felt

>Richie sort looks like a 30 year old lesbian.

 #noH8"
Richie Rich,"Aw, but he was so friendly...."
Richie Rich,"In 2015, Netflix was more like HBO than NBC. They used to take time and only release shows that passed whatever quality checks they had. Now it seems they pretty much buy any  show they can get their hands on, and hope something sticks"
Richie Rich,Where’s “You” ? It’s one of their biggest hits.
Richie Rich,Still can't believe they cancelled Tuca & Bertie & Sense8
Richie Rich,"I remember when I started watching OITNB, the fucking sensation it was, even in my very-conservative country. It had the raunchiest sex scenes that somehow surpassed GOT's, it was nominated for just about every award show in every category. Then the show itself started to fade in season 4 (which is coincidentally the same time Netflix started putting out hundreds of shows). 

Their prestige shows started losing the acclamation, and they began green-lighting a lot of bad projects. 

I'll forever be grateful that it housed Bojack Horseman, Dark, and a few others, but damn, what a fall."
Richie Rich,[deleted]
Richie Rich,"You left out dark, elite, la casa de papel, and other foreign shows that are extremely popular on netflix"
Richie Rich,Grace and Frankie is still the best Netflix original
Richie Rich,"Netflix shows have been on a downward trend for a long time. Even the 2015 list is mostly mediocre tv shows with low budgets, cheap sets and bad lighting. They gained buzz early on by making a small amount of high quality tv shows, but as they expanded the amount of shows they've been making, the quality has been dropping off. They dont care anymore as they have enough people to watch their mediocre shows. 

Even more shows like The Witcher, which I did really like, they messed up by rushing through the storylines and having poor writing. They could have been great, but as other services start to compete, they will start losing subscriptions. Netflix's strength is in the shows that they license."
Richie Rich,"Lot easier to have a lot more buzz when there were less shows in general. 

In 2019 they are competing with themselves, with other platforms. 

There's a new show every other week now, you can't maintain high buzz levels on everything. And not all shows are designed to get high buzz."
Richie Rich,"One word: fatigue.

Be it netflix, be it the viewer. Somewhere fatigue is showing up."
Richie Rich,[deleted]
Richie Rich,You was originally a Lifetime show
Richie Rich,What does being a conservative have to do with it?
Richie Rich,"Looking at his lists, his definition can’t be very accurate. Also, if something getting buzz doesn’t really say anything. I’m not sure why you would use that as a factor."
Richie Rich,[deleted]
Richie Rich,yeah wasn't sure what comparison to make for a network that has a lot of shows but some gems in the dust. Was thinking USA or AMC
Richie Rich,"Here in Brazil it means being against things that are feminist, LGBT, etc. We're mistaken as a sex-positive, progressive country because of carnival but we're really not."
Richie Rich,Sabrina started in 2018
Richie Rich," I bought the Looney Tunes Golden collection on Amazon and it is one of the single greatest purchases any human has ever made

Looney Tunes Golden Collection Vol. 1-6 (6-Pack) https://www.amazon.com/dp/B005NFJAQC/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_apap_qTd8563QJLAW3


Also you could find a lot if them on Kodi and probably some on seriesonline. io"
Richie Rich,"Get the app Pluto on your phone, they have a channel that shows old cartoons"
Richie Rich,I think you can subscribe to Cartoon Network's Boomerang to stream lots of old stuff.
Richie Rich,Boomerang has all the Hanna barbera stuff if you are in the US 
Richie Rich,"BUT WHAT ABOUT TIME SQUAD?! OR MEGAS XLR?! 

seriously. someone find these for me please. I'm stoned."
Richie Rich,On Kodi look at the phoenix add on - there is a cartoon channel on phoenix that has tons of older cartoons -
Richie Rich,Is everyone here too stupid to see that this post was made to draw attention to the new Boomerang streaming service? Convenient that every show op listed will be available on the service. This post was paid for. Fake news!!!
Richie Rich,"Do you mean in the state of Massachusetts or ""en masse?""

Just kidding! Honestly, for some of the older ones your only option might be a comic book store that also sells movies. They often have tons of old crap amongst which you might get lucky. "
Richie Rich,[deleted]
Richie Rich,kimcartoon.me has all of these for free
Richie Rich,Very good question. I will also wait for an answer.
Richie Rich,Get an Amazon Fire Stick and download the Kodi app.
Richie Rich,"Is this a joke?

Edit: I guess I meant to say that this is a legit question I've had for a while. When I was a kid, I did watch a lot of Boomerang (until it started airing cartoon network ads that I hated). That's why there's a lot of shows that were on boom..... because I loved watching them. My dad also watched them when he was a kid so it's good for conversation as well. I guess it kind of looks like an ad except for the fact that I wouldn't mind finding the episodes for download for free."
Richie Rich,Is it http://www.ljsilvers.com?
Richie Rich,Ray Romano is very different from his role in the *Ice Age* films. 
Richie Rich,"Seems like a lot people disliked the pilot, I however enjoyed it a lot. Got instantly hooked and it felt like a feature Scorsese movie."
Richie Rich,"Well, it definitely felt like it was directed by Marty Scorsese. "
Richie Rich,"Went in expecting a good pilot, left with a rather excellent Scorsese movie. "
Richie Rich,"Hello, Birgitte Sørensen."
Richie Rich,Ray Romano says his sex scene is in episode 7 if I recall correctly.
Richie Rich,Thats a sick apartment Finestra has.
Richie Rich,The fight scene at the Punk concert was fucking great! It's like something you'd see at an early Stooges concert. 
Richie Rich,Have high hopes for this one. 
Richie Rich,Hooray new show!
Richie Rich,"There's a lot of potential here.  Wasn't blown away, but I'm interested to see where it goes from here.  And no matter what, the music is always going to be good."
Richie Rich,Long haired Dice is weird...
Richie Rich,"This show created by amazing ensemble: George Mastras who worked on breaking bad, Winter who wrote Wolf of Wall Street, and made BoardWalk empire, and Martin fucking Scorsese. How is it gettin mixed review? :-/"
Z Nation,"It's what I call ""a check your brain at the door"" show. It's fun, campy and does not take itself seriously. Neither should we. It's not going to win grandiose awards (although the zombie cheese wheel? c'mon! LOL) but the actors make it fun.   


Black Summer is a companion show and it wasn't the same tone."
Z Nation,"I watched the entire series, it was fun and made light of itself on several occasions.  it was enjoyable"
Z Nation,"I was in the beginning and thought it had a lot of promise, but with each season it's gotten just...it's kinda not sure what it wants to be and that sucks a lot of the joy out of it. It's something that's best watched on one's way to inebriation and I'm watching it now out of morbid curiosity than anything else."
Z Nation,I did love the early seasons but man did it get shit later on.
Z Nation,Things got a bit off the rails in later seasons but overall I'm not mad that I spent the time watching it
Z Nation,"I quit after season 3, it was fun for a while."
Z Nation,"Gave up somewhere in season 4. Just lost interest. Enjoyed Black Summer (kinda) though.

Season 1 was a lot of fun though."
Z Nation,I like it more than Walking dead.
Z Nation,It gets a little convoluted in Season 3 but finishes strong in the end.
Z Nation,"Z nation was pretty great for the over the top sequences they did.  The story was... um... laughably bad, and the acting was worse, but the actual concepts they managed to pull off were impressive.  I ended up dropping it before or right after season 3 started."
Z Nation,"Hell yeah.

""If anyone asks, we were nowhere near the Grand Canyon."""
Z Nation,"Recently got into it myself. Just started season 3. I never got into The Walking Dead so I was a little hesitant to try it, but got hooked after a couple episodes"
Z Nation,"Came for Garth and stuck around, its goofy but the fun kind."
Z Nation,"I liked the first season a lot, since it's unashamedly campy and a real rollercoaster of an adventure. But it went downhill from there, for me. Too forced and overwrought."
Z Nation,I liked it. It's a fun show and a great binge.
Z Nation,"I've been meaning to catch the latest season. I really enjoy the show, it has a good sense of humor about it."
Z Nation,"The first two seasons were fun, I hung on for three and some of four before I dumped it. 

The ""prequel"" on Netflix is ok..."
Z Nation,"/r/znation

I like the walking dead, read the comics and have watched the show from the beginning, but this is definitely good in it's own way. Unfortunately it got the axe."
Z Nation,"Even with all the campiness of Znation it was still somehow more realistic than TWD. At least the way people act or talk and just the general state of the apocalypse. I mean, it clearly goes way off the rails, but still."
Z Nation,[deleted]
Z Nation,"I feel the same. BUT I got to enjoy it like it was a COMEDY lol I think I quit around Season 3, or 4, can't remember."
Z Nation,"I was in until shit got nuked. It was always goofy, but that was too much to suspend disbelief. I don't think the writers understand the scale of nuclear weapons."
Z Nation,"Yea. 4 had some highlights, but 5 except Limbo was one big turd"
Z Nation,"I'm watching the first season right now. While it's a fun watch, it's really bad from the get go."
Z Nation,"> a real rollercoaster

A giant zombie cheese wheel of an adventure!"
Z Nation,"Usually it's only Murphy that complains one person is in charge LOL and there's good, honest and open communication (except when Murphy is involved LOL)"
Z Nation,"> Best watched on the way to inebriation is the perfect way to describe Z Nation.


I would move up the timeline a bit if I were you, and make sure you have arrived at inebriation by the time the credits roll, then move on to hammersville by the halfway point."
Z Nation,"I think they were gonna get cancelled so they nuked, and them they got renewed."
Z Nation,Oh yea I mean it’s all bad haha just even like fun wise it goes down the drain
Z Nation,"If anyone asks, we were nowhere near Wisconsin!"
Z Nation,Or just smoke a j and get blasted
Z Nation,I got that impression too. Seemed like a big punch-out ending.
Z Nation,"There was a lot more action, movement, and story progression with Z Nation and I think one of the best was the zombies evolving and changing each season which kept the story fresh and alive. It was so good!!!"
Z Nation,"They are totally different shows and z nation generally has far lower production and writing quality so I don't know why comparisons would be common.

That said I also like z nation it is fun as hell in a b movie kind of way.

If you don't know Netflix has a prequel to z nation called black summer with a season already out. I haven't watched yet but you should probably check it out if you can. You might like it."
Z Nation,"It was a reasonably-enjoyable show up until the last couple seasons. Then they changed the showrunner and the writers room...

Let me preface this by saying I love people of all stars and stripes...

But the last two seasons, EVERY character turned at least a little bi-curious. It was literally the hook for the show because they couldn't figure out compelling plot/character study

Now, there's nothing wrong with expressing the spectrum of sexuality that exists. But they took all of these interesting storylines. Character development. Everything that made the show unique. And they turned it into a steaming pile of crap where all of a sudden, the focus is on these characters exploring their sexuality versus exploring/surviving the zombie apocolypse.

Again, it's not that the fact that they address sexuality that killed it for me. It's just that, in comparison to earlier seasons, it became way too obvious they were relying on that and other gimmicks to draw an audience because they ran out of creative steam."
Z Nation,"That, I agree with, I used to love the walking dead, but then it just got stupidly repetitive and people kept spoiling a lot of the newer seasons, like right after they came out. So I went to Z nation, It's funny, cool, and they have whacky Z's, and Murphy is just cool.

10/10"
Z Nation,"I gave up on Z nation after one season. Gave up on TWD after they let Negan live (I know they did in the comics but wtf?). I mean, yeah, it's boring and stupid and I wouldn't have stayed on much longer anyway but geesh."
Z Nation,"I enjoyed Z Nation so much more than the Walking Dead and just like the Walking Dead I dumped Z nation in the third season.

Citizen Z just got to be grating and the show just got a bit too silly.

The prequel show on Netflix is good until the red head/autistic guy episodes where he runs around and basically causes half a city to die, it dips further and further down until the final episode, which is just absurd."
Z Nation,"They are two different show but they both consist of the zombie apocalypse.   

So there is still some comparison to be had on how it's approached."
Z Nation,">  They are totally different shows

No they aren't..

> so I don't know why comparisons would be common.

Because they both are post apocalypse zombie shows. They are exactly the same genre and are contemporaries of each other."
Z Nation,"It's supposed to be silly, imo that's the whole allure of the show (at least it was for me)."
Z Nation,"I didn't say they would not exist I just don't think Syfy shows and cable shows are ever compared much in the first place.

Either way I was just contributing to the discussion."
Z Nation,"It's produced by [The Asylum](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Asylum), what they produce is generally considered the lowest of the low production and cost wise. It's the company that makes all those mockbusters that occasionally tricks grandmothers into buying the wrong movie for their grandkids before christmas and birthdays. 

They are also responsible for a lot of the monster features on SyFy like Sharknado etc, it's probably how they got their foot in the door and got to produce an actual TV show for the network. 

A couple of their other films from 2013 include the likes of Airplane vs. Volcano, Asian School Girls, Atlantic Rim and Android Cop. In other words we are talking about some HBO levels of quality stuff here people. ^^/s
"
Z Nation,Is this on SyFy?  It's a shame they passed on Blood and Chrome for this garbage. 
Z Nation,"> how the hell did someone at SyFy sit there and green light an entire season of this shit?

Fixed that for you, and this should also be the answer to your question."
Z Nation,[deleted]
Z Nation,"I almost didn't watch Z Nation because it is made by Asylum but decided to give it a go.  I actually think they are doing what they set out to do, which is make a B zombie movie series.  It lacks all the interpersonal drama and brooding that have become really popular in TV, I find this refreshing.  It's 42 minutes of old school zombie movie a week and that is all it's aiming for.  I'm OK with this if I feel like just turning my brain off.

SyFY in general should really be ashamed of themselves though.  Z Nation is just one more shit show on what has become a shit network.  They took any critical good will and just flushed it down the toilet.  The only good science fiction on the network is Defiance and that was really spotty in the beginning, I do think in general the 2nd season was pretty good and shows potential.  It feels like instead of trying to innovate at all SyFy is just trying to follow trends or re/package known products. "
Z Nation,"They might as well throw in vampires that say ""bleh"" now"
Z Nation,"I just saw S01E02. It's stupid harmless b-grade fun. It would be more enjoyable if it was a little smarter, but it's fine as it is."
Z Nation,I'm glad so many tv shows are getting canceled or shitted on by people. It helps weed out all the unoriginal show creators and gives a chance to the people who don't have corporate affiliations. 
Z Nation,Dude have you watched Dominion? SyFy is severely lacking with these new shows
Z Nation,"I watched episode one and knew that I was done with this show.

I guess the premise is okay about how a guy should be immune to becoming a zombie, but the show is done so poorly."
Z Nation,"I saw the trailer, and thought "" ok, it looks pretty bad. But I guess it has potential to be good."". So then I watched the first episode, and pretty much got what I expected for the first 2/3. Then the most likeable character ""in my opinion"" of the whole show, and probably the one that would move the story forward gets eaten... The show's premise had potential to be a really good and unique show, but it failed miserably. I was disappointed with the first episode, but I will watch the second episode just to make sure that I don't like the show."
Z Nation,"You have to go into it like the movie Lincoln: Vampire Hunter, or Last Airbender.

You need to watch them from a comedy perspective and enjoy them for how bad they are."
Z Nation,"Yeah, I'm afraid I'm pretty much burned out on the zombie genre anyway, other than The Walking Dead, where there's as much drama in the storyline as there is in wondering if they're gonna knock off one of the leads each week. I caught episode one of this turd last week, lasted about ten minutes last night, and that was enough to remind me how cliché ridden and poorly written it is."
Z Nation,"It was worse than the first episode.  I kept having to fast-forward through, because much of it was just long, drawn out, time-filling cliches, e.g., cat scares.  The moment-to-moment pointlessness and inconsistencies reminded me of Helix.

I understand they're trying to forge off and create a zombie show that has a different feel than The Walking Dead, so they've tried to go lighter.  But it's kid's stuff.  It feels like something 13-year-olds would want to watch, but which holds no interest for adults.  It seems like the producers are unable (either because of inability or budget constraints) to apply to this show the lessons learned during the past decade of premium TV shows:  a concentration on character, dialogue and plot consistence.

"
Z Nation,"I watched episode two as well hoping that it might improve from the first one.

What a waste of time that was"
Z Nation,[deleted]
Z Nation,"The show is silly and  fun, way less boring than the walking dead!"
Z Nation,"Wow,  am I the only one that liked it?   Haven't seen the second episode yet.   Though I do tend to like cheesey B-rated movies.   Also thought it was funny to see DJ Qualls in it. "
Z Nation,"I got half way throw the first one. Horseshit all round. From the hammy acting, dire plot and terrible c.g. AVOID."
Z Nation,"that show is soooo bad

and somehow managed to get some decent known actors which doesn't save it at all"
Z Nation,"I actually liked it. I like TWD as well. But of course, I'm a zombie fanatic....which makes me feel like this is who that show was made for. 

Let's think about this for a second, TWD has elements of drama and romance that are going to get gen-pop's (general population) panties all in a bunch of happiness. While ZN is more of the B-Flick Campy zombie goodness from yesteryear that will more than likely go over well with? People who are associated (or rather used to be associated with, because I think we can all agree ""Syfy"" has sucked for quite some time...and the spelling of the name only confirmed that :p) with SyFy, the fanatics etc. 

Unfortunately what the show did not realize, and how they could not have realized this I'm not quite sure but I digress, is the amount of cross over TWD has created, therefore fans of TWD (who we have already deduced are broadspan fans rather than specified/fanatic fans) are going to think ""ah Z Nation another Zed show I might like, sorta like TWD"", watch it, realize one is not like the other, and compare the hell out of them. When in actuality, there isn't any comparison, *not* because one is oh so much better than the other, but because it's in the same genre."
Z Nation,"I saw the trailer.

They lost me at zombie baby."
Z Nation,Syfy is just trying to cash in on TWD hype with this pile of shit. It was so fucking awful I dropped it after 15 mins. Its fucking TERRIBLE.
Z Nation,"I really wanted this show to be good. I heard it was being filmed in my town (Spokane) and was really excited to see all of the landmarks around the town zombified.

It's so bad. It's really, really bad. The acting is terrible, the effects are terrible, it's bland, it's boring, it's shit."
Z Nation,This was on my watch list. Guess I better scratch it off after reading these comments.
Z Nation,Done!  Thanks for the advice 
Z Nation,The idea of transporting a person across the USA who is immune to the virus  and has been munched on and has has potential but the way it has been written and directed is shit. 
Z Nation,I've read the show description and left it at that.
Z Nation,"Still, I bet it wasn't as boring as that show on AMC."
Z Nation,"yeah I watched the first episode, it was terrible, I wasn't planning on going back, but I done that with Arrow as well, watched the first one or two episodes and thought nahh..this is a bit too much like a Batman ripoff...,but people here kept saying how awesome it was and I went back and watched it to the last episode of the last season. 

 it has a few corny moments but I enjoyed Arrow very much, this show however I doubt will get better.

"
Z Nation,Its a good show for Syfi. I actually really like it better than TWD.....cause TWD is slow at shit. At least Z is plot driven. 
Z Nation,"Sy-Fy is a joke of a network that has one thing going for it; Face-Off. If it weren't for that one show, I wouldn't even bother watching the shit that ""graces"" that channel. It has to have the most idiotic movies, series, and events I have ever seen in all of my years watching TV. It is useless, and bring the whole genre down by hundreds of notches. "
Z Nation,"Ahem, it's called SyFy now. You can't associate it with sci-fi and those gross nerds."
Z Nation,"It can't be much worse that The Walking Dead, a show featuring a crew of crack shots that can headshot a zombie thirty yards away with a pistol from a moving vehicle off road, then proceed to waste twenty minutes of my time with pointless conversation and panoramic shots.
Keep in mind, I'm cool with the comics."
Z Nation,I stopped watching SyFy when they cancelled Caprica and Stargate Universe in favor of making crappy movies with horrible CG like Dinocroc vs Supergator and Sharktopus. I'd be willing to come back if they made something decent. I'm still waiting
Z Nation,"As someone native to where it was filmed (spokane, WA), and someone who has lots of friends &  family members in it - I'm actually enjoying watching it. It's SyFy-it's not supposed to be incredible, it's supposed to be just that,  Syfy. (Cheesy/ low budget). Either way, I'll continue watching it to see my hometown friends &  family on TV. :) "
Z Nation,[deleted]
Z Nation,"Living in the area where it's filmed, and knowing the owner of the production company, I can't say I'm surprised that its crap. I read part of a persons lines and they were bad. Also unfortunately for all of you they have ordered another season already. "
Z Nation,where's Wil Wheaton to make fun of a steaming pile of turd when we need him? :(
Z Nation,It got greenlit because the pilot was entertaining.
Z Nation,Late to party: throw The Walking Dead out the window then watch Z Nation -- Way less money into this show but it's still a fun ride if you enjoy zombie movies or shows. Sure the writing isn't great but it'll keep you entertained!!
Z Nation,"""Hov did that, so hopefully yall wont have to go through that"""
Z Nation,"God, those last two sound like Chinese knock-offs.  How much artistic integrity do they have to lack to resort to using titles similar to Hollywood-produced movies to try and trick people into seeing their movies?

Don't have the budget?  Might as well not even try and just use underhanded trickery to try and make a living."
Z Nation,"> Airplane vs. Volcano, Asian School Girls, Atlantic Rim

Wait, go back a bit..."
Z Nation,I'm more pissed about Caprica. It had problems but was really getting interesting toward the end. 
Z Nation,"Maybe a BSG revival is just what SyFy needs right now. Although, at this point in their network I wouldn't trust them to not ruin it."
Z Nation,"Blood and Chrome was great! Sci-fi channel is garbage. Science fiction used to take a brain to enjoy. They found dumb people have started to enjoy it. Look at star gate Atlantis, the simplest cheesiest of all three. Then comes universe, the darkest and most serious of all three that had the most potential to be the best but require more than 30 seconds of your attention. SG universe and blood and chrome were two of the best sci fi shows in the last decade!!! And the fucking channel that is supposedly dedicated to sci-fi cancels them. "
Z Nation,[removed]
Z Nation,"Renaming the channel to SyFy is not really a stupid move IMO, gives more brand recognition.

Whether you want that brand attached is another matter entirely..."
Z Nation,"Do you work for the syfy channel? If not, you have missed your calling."
Z Nation,i would watch the shit out of this
Z Nation,"good call, watching the z-nado ep now."
Z Nation,They did that in one of the episodes.  No joke.
Z Nation,"You hit the nail right on the head. This SHOW is doing just fine as a schlocky B movie, and that would be all well and good if it wasn't for the fact that that's all SYFY orders any more."
Z Nation,The fact that Defiance is the best thing they've got going is really depressing to me. I like the show but it's nowhere near a must watch for me. I wait till the season is done and watch them all in one go. I miss having a sci fi series that's so good I have to watch it on air.
Z Nation,"It's not even B level though, it's worse than that, it's like... C!"
Z Nation,"> It lacks all the interpersonal drama and brooding that have become really popular in TV, I find this refreshing.
> 


Except it tries to do all these things and just fails.

There's only one thing to say about this show, it is bad."
Z Nation,"SciFi was doing really well with Alphas, Eureka and Warehouse 13, but it seems that they've scrapped that to be Asylum TV."

Naruto,AttackOnTitan\_FinalRealUpdateFINAL002.avi
Naruto,Part 3 will be split into two halves? This show will go on for infinity
Naruto,"They really are taking the piss splitting up the ""final"" season yet again..."
Naruto,I think Attack on Titan is going to hold the record for the most drawn-out final season for a long time. Even Vikings was not this blatant at contract loopholing.
Naruto,[deleted]
Naruto,"So we're gonna have four parts, ok...

They should have made 12 episodes seasons since the beggining, this is getting out of hand lol"
Naruto,Really needs to stop calling it “final season” when it’s not the final season….
Naruto,So the final season has 3 parts and the third part is split into two parts
Naruto,This is beyond obnoxious now.
Naruto,Wouldn't that make it part 3 and part 4??
Naruto,"Lol, I still remember recommending this to my brother 3 years ago and he said he didn't want to watch it until it was all released cause he hates cliffhangers.  Convinced him to start it anyways ""cause the final season is coming out in just a couple months""."
Naruto,"followed by a Part 4 with 3 parts.

and then Part 5 with 10 parts.

and then the LAST EPISODE, split in 100 episodes..."
Naruto,"Attack on Titan: The Final Season , Part 3, Part 1: The First Half"
Naruto,"Final Season   
Part 3   
Volume 2   
Subsection A-112

Austin 3:16   
Jenny/867-5309"
Naruto,Lmao Jesus Christ this is why the final season label is a joke they’ve been saying final season for years this is some r/nottheonion shit
Naruto,I refuse to watch the “FiNaL sEaSoN” until it’s actually over. This blue balling they’re doing is absolutely annoying and killing any hype I had for the show. The manga’s ending being apparently shit doesn’t really help either.
Naruto,"I have no children and I fear my grandchildren will still be watching the final season of Attack on Titan.

I haven't even watched the last part since I knew it wasn't all of it. Just give me the rest so I can finally watch the end of this series. You're just making me hate things you produce."
Naruto,So final season is just a lie flat out
Naruto,I'm honestly glad that it's split into two parts. That means they're actually taking their time animating all of the crazy action packed chapters.
Naruto,AoT finale is actually an asymptote.
Naruto,Wow I have never seen “final season” milked so hard
Naruto,Attack on Titan Season 4 Part 3 Part 1

I am prepared for this to happen next"
Naruto,"I believe theres only 9 more manga chapters left. So however they decide to split it , it wont total more than 9 episodes... I think"
Naruto,"Zeno's Paradox, if they keep splitting the second half in two it will never end."
Naruto,As someone who loves AOT. The way they have handled season 4 is so fuckin stupid it almost turns me off of the series
Naruto,Evangelion movie title
Naruto,The final season got more seasons than the rest of the show.
Naruto,"They are milking the shit out of the ""final"" season.

Can't wait for Attack on Titan: Final Season - Part 3 - Part 2 - The Movie 3"
Naruto,"Ah okay, so we're currently on the first season of the third season of the final season."
Naruto,Can't wait for the eventual Attack on Titan: Final Season Part 3 part a Subsection B
Naruto,"man, can't wait Attack on Titan: Season 4/4, Part 3/3, sub-part 2/2...

Honestly, I was hyped as hell going into the ""last"" season,  but this has been so drawn out that it's completely killed my excitement and interest.  feels like the show has fallen way off the zeitgeist since the first part of the final season aired."
Naruto,So it's the final final 4 seasons?
Naruto,Are we there yet like that 1 kid at school bus
Naruto,What the actual fuck. I went into season 4 reasonably excited but all my hype bled out ages  ago.
Naruto,I didn’t even know there was supposed to be another part. I guess with all these false “finals” I’ve stopped really paying attention.
Naruto,Season 4: Final Season: Part 3: First Half: Part A: Prelude Interlude: 012: Dawn Of The First Day: Redux: A Fragmentory Passage: Game Of Thrones S03E05 actually: The Game: The Show: The Game: The Telltale Series: Remastered: Part 1: Part 2: Part 1
Naruto,"Announce the 2nd part of part 3 in two halves, and then that last part in two halves also."
Naruto,"Why.
Just. Why.
Put it all out at once and fucking be done with it!"
Naruto,God fucking damn it Mappa.
Naruto,"I'm starting to be kind of glad I lost interest watching this, lmao. Are they on the final season for over 2 years now?"
Naruto,Ive read the manga i know how shit the end of this series is
Naruto,"i'm so confused

this dumbass show has been in its final season for like 3 years"
Naruto,"am so confused, wasnt this show supposed to end with last season?"
Naruto,And second half will be released in 2024 which will also be split into two halves and this goes on forever.
Naruto,Tf? This still isn't done?  Damn they're really milking this if they have to split part 3 of the final season lol stuff like this makes me lose interest.  Too drawn out.
Naruto,The final-final-final episode is being written by George RR Martin.
Naruto,i haven't watched the show since like the 2nd season but i thought it ended?
Naruto,Are they trying to milk this series as much as they can because they know the ending is pure and utterly trash?
Naruto,"Queso Qristo, they've been milking this final season as bad as Evangelion. Just end it already."
Naruto,"Considering how successful that was for *Stranger Things* last year, I strongly suspect it will become the streaming norm for their tentpole shows."
Naruto,"You know, my issue with season 1 of aot, and the reason I stopped following it until recently, was that I felt the pacing was unbearably slow, where it takes a million episodes to cover the smallest things. 

Good to see nothing changes."
Naruto,People really have a problem with how the pronunciation of another part sounds. Lol these kids should really find some work to do.
Naruto,I thought the show was done lol
Naruto,Attack on Titans Final Season Part 3 sub part 1
Naruto,"Wow. I really thought it had ended already. I thought it was a bad/ambiguous ending, but thought that was the end."
Naruto,They are going to milk this cow for all it's worth huh?
Naruto,[deleted]
Naruto,The goofiest show of all time.
Naruto,Will the second half have a final part sequel mid-season finale spinoff?
Naruto,This is a fucking joke.
Naruto,"Unless they change the outcome , im gonna skip it , the Manga ending was a bummer enough , I do t wana watch it again"
Naruto,"This is fucking embarrassing at this point. I watched the first season in my final year of high school. I have been in the workforce, going into my ninth year. I watched the first part of the season under the impression we might wait half a year at most but this is shameful. when you have breaks this long its not a fucking part, its a new season. 

From what I've heard of the ending, the Cringevengers and the Fumbling its not even going to have been worth the wait."
Naruto,AOE fans let's go!
Naruto,Way to turn a good show in to a joke.
Naruto,"are they changing the ending from the Manga? Cause, well........yeah"
Naruto,I really could not care less about this show anymore can we stip dragging it along. The story is absolutely awful now and I'm not excited for the ending cause it's pretty obvious how things are gonna go at this point season 1 and 2 were so great but it's been downhill since then with a couple bright spots.
Naruto,"&#x200B;

Jesus fucking christ, come on now there cant be anymore than like 8 episodes left. The way they are dragging this out is fucking miserable."
Naruto,"This show got way too ridiculous and convoluted after season 2. 

I still have no idea wtf is happening because of how poorly it bounces around timeline wise. I was in love with the show after season 1 but this is stupid."
Naruto,"Holy cow this is still going? I swear I heard about the ""final season"" like 3 years ago."
Naruto,funny
Naruto,Why is it called the final season if it keeps getting more and more parts??
Naruto,"hell, I said I'd watch the final season when all the episode come out. I've been waiting for 2 years!!! I'll probably wait another year"
Naruto,"""The final final final season! Soon to be followed by the final final final final season!""  


Isn't this going to be 4 parts now?"
Naruto,Also the second half of part 3 will be split in 2 more parts
Naruto,Attack on Titan:Final Season (part 3((part 1)) Episode 1
Naruto,Can’t wait for the finale in The Final Season : Part 3 : Part 2
Naruto,Mappa managing the naming of their show like I would call my homework files
Naruto,"The final season (Part 3) part 1, and the second half The Final Season (Part 3) part 2: section A and The Final Season (Part 3) part 2: section B"
Naruto,Watch them announce a movie after the second half and we have to wait even longer.
Naruto,At this point just admit you were wrong and call it season whatever it is at this point. Man did they miss the mark on how much they could do in a season.
Naruto,Attack on Titan: The Final Season (Part 3) (Part 1) (Taylor’s Version)
Naruto,LMAOOOOOOOOO FINISH IT ALREADY
Naruto,"Such a shame they ruined the story's pacing by naming all 43 parts ""The Final Season"""
Naruto,"The rumbling is coming, I swear guys."
Naruto,"Attack on Titan: The Final Season, Part 3 Part 2"
Naruto,For Fucks Sake
Naruto,"After the end of the second half they will announce the final episodes, split into two parts."
Naruto,"The creaters are straight up a holes for making a THREE part final season that's broken up into 6 parts. This was legit like 2 full seasons at least... They just trying to hook us in with these cliffhangers.

But I've been hooked since season one.."
Naruto,"I don’t get the feeling most fans are upset there’s more AoT, it’s just the naming convention of S4 has been comically misleading."
Naruto,"This is the worst marketing campaign ever

4 seasons do not make 1 final season! There was 3 regular seasons and 4 final seasons like wtf are you doing"
Naruto,This didn't end??
Naruto,"At this point I don't care, as the show progressed I gave less shit about it."
Naruto,"this is a joke, they already made me look up the Manga ending with all this edging"
Naruto,"So, they pulling a Naruto: Shippuden, but instead of a ass ton of fillers, they're going to keep splitting it up."
Naruto,Can't wait to see Part 3 Section 1 and Part 3 Section 2
Naruto,"Final season part 3, part 1???"
Naruto,I am so glad I jumped to the manga for the remaining story. This is absolutely absurd.
Naruto Shippuden,:( yes i know yet ANOTHER filler.

Naruto Shippuden,And the season one intro for spice and wolf
Naruto Shippuden,i meant fma brotherhood op 4 like i said.
Naruto Shippuden,so they reused an op from the original series in the newer show?
Naruto Shippuden,oh shit you're right. this is from the og not brotherhood my bad. 😅
Naruto Shippuden,"Vikings and Ozark are not on the list because you did not enjoyed or because you never watched?

I love Game of Thrones,The Last Kingdom,The Handmaid's Tale and Westworld from your list.
Unpopular but i also enjoyed Cursed,It was fun to watch.
Season 4 of The Walking Dead was one of the best seasons in my opinion,If you disliked that season you would have hated some seasons in the future."
Naruto Shippuden,Big Mouth is 10? That's seriously the worst show I've ever seen.  I always wondered who exactly watched that.
Naruto Shippuden,How is Ted lasso not a 10
Naruto Shippuden,Bob is awesome! Love that show!
Naruto Shippuden,"If you subtracted 5 from each rating and went an ""* out of 5"" rating system instead, it still would be about the same."
Naruto Shippuden,"Half of Game of Thrones (seasons 1-4) is a 10/10 show and the other half of it (seasons 5-8) is a 2/10 show.

So averaging them together, the show gets a 6/10."
Naruto Shippuden,Breaking Bad but no Better Call Saul?
Naruto Shippuden,Ewww Chrishell and Christine are both bad. Mary all the way.
Naruto Shippuden,"Vikings and Ozark are on my list to watch! As for TWD I think I may have stopped after 3rd season? I don't remember as it was a while back but will definitely have to resume. I forgot to add to this list but the new show Invincible is really, really good and is made from the same people as TWD, highly recommend."
Naruto Shippuden,exceptional in its 1st season and hits different but 10/10 is hard to hit for me and should be reserved for the absolute best that couldn't have been better
Naruto Shippuden,😑
Naruto Shippuden,"if he multiplied each rating by 13.8 and did a “* out of 138” rating sys, it would also be about the same"
Naruto Shippuden,"It definitely got worse in the later seasons but for the most part it was still pretty epic, quality, or maybe I was just so invested at that point (sunk cost). Either way still an amazing show but I get where you're coming from"
Naruto Shippuden,Simply haven't seen but I hear it's as good as if not better than BB
Naruto Shippuden,Mary is indeed the most mature and apparently carries the load in terms of earnings for the O group. the favoritism seems to only be for drama as she has actually earned her place at the top.
Naruto Shippuden,"If you like Ozark, check out Justified."

The Musketeers,"Big agree.

Ryan Gage is SO good as Louis."
The Musketeers,I would love more swashbuckling historical shows that dont take themselves too seriously. Plus I just love Aramis.
The Musketeers,It does a good job of making Richelieu believable with the musketeers opposing him.  They don't always win and they don't always lose.  So it has a lot of tension in the episodes.
The Musketeers,a bit too swaggery but very very entertaining. Great intro as well
The Musketeers,"BBC made a lot of good stuff, I notice the Brits care more for quality vs quantity. I feel both the Brits and the French are sitting on a lot of good stuff. Just letting them collect dust on shelves somewhere."
The Musketeers,It's actually overrated
The Musketeers,YES. Loved that the King wasnt a one-dimensional character and Ryan Gage is always a win
The Musketeers,Aramis is definitely a win ;)
The Musketeers,Yes. Shame we didn't get more of Richelieu in the following seasons.
The Musketeers,"First and second is fun to watch him having fun, but in the third season, man, that was just fantastic."
The Musketeers,"I wish they recast the actor. Peter went off to do Doctor Who, but losing Richelieu was a big blow to the show"
The Musketeers,"One of the guys in this, Santiago Cabrera, is in *Star Trek: Picard*.

Also Peter Capaldi is in the first season as Cardinal Richelieu before leaving to do *Doctor Who*; he literally learned he had got the latter part while in costume on the set."
The Musketeers,"Of all the admittedly ridiculous takes on classic stories that the Brits have released in the last fifteen years (looking at you fondly Robin Hood and Merlin), this is my favorite.  I liked the different takes on the characters, the oh so anachronistic but detailed costumes, the self-contained stories in each season, and the actual character development.

Not everything has to be Breaking Bad or Game of Thrones.  Sometimes television can just be hot guys in lots of leather and pretty girls in nice dresses and sword-fighting and horse-riding and window-jumping and forbidden romance and one-liners and good friendship and fun.

I think it is currently on Amazon Prime.  Check out the pilot and if you are entertained, you will like the rest of the series."
The Musketeers,"I remember watching this show, but I don't remember if I finished it. I remember it was fun and I enjoyed it."
The Musketeers,I have it in my queue but have not checked it out.  I will finally do so.
The Musketeers,"Thanks for posting, I'm definitely going to give this a try!

Edit: watched the first episode and it was great!"
The Musketeers,I adored this show but never got round to watching S3 cause I was so damn sad it wasn't renewed. Don't want it to be over. :(
The Musketeers,Nice! Gonna check it out. Thanks.
The Musketeers,Aramis is the best !!!!
The Musketeers,">amazing production values

&#x200B;

i had to rewind a lot because I'd zone out looking at their outfits and miss the dialog."
The Musketeers,Is it like Versailles?
The Musketeers,"This sounds like something I might need in my life at one point.

Thanks to you and the OP for bringing it to my attention."
The Musketeers,"I would also say it is the only one of the three you mentioned to end well. Robin Hood was bad in a good way until S3, that was just plain bad and Merlin had the worst ending."
The Musketeers,Must only be on prime in the US not up here in Canada
The Musketeers,God I hate plebs
The Musketeers,"He is, indeed, a man of many virtues."
The Musketeers,Not really.  It is much more tongue in cheek and action oriented.  It‘s based on fiction more than any real history.
The Musketeers,">Versailles

I haven't seen that series but I just watched the trailer - very similar period and general vibe, but *The Musketeers* is much more action/adventure oriented."
The Musketeers,"I concur, Musketeers (UK) is an absolutely awesome show. The storylines are intense, the acting is top notch and the decors and landscapes are incredible.

If you like what we French call ""de cape de d'épée"" (literally ""of capes and swords"") movies (a French specialty, btw), you'll love this show.

I'm not a huge fan of Versailles but it's a goos show.

The Crown is awesome, but it's about the queen of England, it's not a swashbuckling tv show at all."
The Musketeers,"The most similar show isn’t on Netflix sadly: Black Sails. I absolutely recommend it though. 

Similar and on Netflix: the Last Kingdom, Outlander"
The Musketeers,"The Crown is amazing and is actually about the current queen. Reign is alright. I wouldn't say it's the best thing I've seen or the worst. I enjoyed The Tudors more. The Tudors is based on Henry the 8th, but I'd say quite loosely. Still a good watch if you haven't seen it. I also recommend Borgia. It's also loosely based on the Borgia family, but still an interesting watch. Marco Polo was awesome and would absolutely suggest you give it a shot. "
The Musketeers,"""Lighthearted period drama and Swordfighting"" is one of my favourite TV categories."
The Musketeers,">wonder why I've never seen it talked about.

Reddit never talks about UK shows for some reason, and it sucks because they're some of my favorite.  The BBC is producing some of the best television these days, and Americans are overlooking it for some reason... not sure why, because all of the great British series are aired on PBS.  Netflix has a great collection, but Amazon Video also has an excellent library of amazing UK shows."
The Musketeers,"Loved The Musketeers.

I would say Marco Polo is pretty similar, great costumes and set design, good action and drama. I think you will enjoy it."
The Musketeers,"If you like this, may i recommend BBC's [Robin Hood] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wweuy_YKt7k) series from a few years ago. It lasted 3 seasons."
The Musketeers,"Versailles:  Gorgeous, sexy, full if political intrigue and improbably attractive people.  Very good.

Reign:  Total soap opera - Ridiculously photogenic young cast, scenery chewing acting, plot twists and silliness.  Soundtrack is modern, costumes are tween girl versions of what real princesses wear.  It is silly but light and fun to watch. Think, ""A Knights Tale"" for 7 or so seasons. 

Outlander:  Based on a hugely successful book series, it's a time-travel period piece.  Costumes and history are well done, love & sex & politics & gender roles & sadism all woven together with beautiful music and mysticism.  At the center is a single love story.  I recommend.

The Crown: Well researched and acted story - very good, but very different from the swashbuckling epics above.  

My favorite - Vikings:  swords, sex, glory, intrigue, insanely beautiful scenery, politics, philosophy, conflict.  It's about a Viking  determined to sail and find glory and wealth in unknown lands - he kidnaps a priest and what follows is an epic story of friendship and conflict and so on. It's an immersion into a dream state - very well acted and weaves myth and storytelling into history in a lovely way."
The Musketeers,yes! I absolutely loved this show. The four musketeers are excellent (Tom Burke and Santiago Cabrera as Athos and Aramis especially) and every actor they chose as the villain was superb. It's a shame Peter Capaldi was only in the first season but I mean he left to be the Doctor so it's completely understandable. The show has just the right amount of humor and action and the stories are all very good.
The Musketeers,"I enjoyed the Musketeers too. Binged the first two seasons but stalled at the beginning of the third with yet another rinse/repeat evil bad guy making life difficult for the Musketeers routine. I did prefer Peter Capaldi in the first season.

You will like Versailles (enjoyed the first haven't started on the second). Interesting to see George Blagden (Athelstan from Vikings)  and as others have suggested check out Vikings too (bit heavier going than Musketeers).  
Crown, Reign, and Outlander I can't comment on but Marco Polo is worth a watch (but again different style from Musketeers ).
Other historical shows you should check out:

The Last kingdom

The Tudors

The Borgias (with Jeremy irons)

Rome

Turn

Frontier

War and Peace (with Paul Dano)

Black Sails

EDIT - Forgot ""Da Vinci's Demons""


They all have a heavier tone to them and are not as swashbuckling as the Musketeers though - don't recall anything similar though (Spartacus is a different style) .
"
The Musketeers,"Is anyone else annoyed that they went with the [Movie Superheroes Wear Black](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MovieSuperheroesWearBlack) trope? I think there's a great visual shorthand in having the Musketeers wear blue and the Cardinal's Guards wear red, and it adds a lot of color and vibrancy to the visuals in general. If the action is good and there's some humor in the dialogue, those are definite selling points, but I find it annoying that they seemed to opt for the ""as drab as possible"" color palette."
The Musketeers,This is apparently not on US Netflix. Ah well.
The Musketeers,"The Crown is pretty interesting, I'd recommend it. Season two comes out in January I believe. 

I tried watching Versailles, but all the actors have British accents and it just killed it for me right off the bat. It made it hard to get into. 

Watch The Tudors on Netflix if you haven't already. I highly recommend it! "
The Musketeers,"Sounds interesting! Does it end well? I mean like does it wrap up in a satisfactory way or did it seem like it was just cancelled out of the blue?

I've watched Marco Polo and I really enjoyed it. It's more serious based on your description of The Musketeers, but it has a lot of fun characters played by talented actors. Honestly I never cared much about the overarching plot, I was more interested in the character stuff.

Unfortunately it got cancelled so it just sorta stops. I hate that and want to avoid that bitter feeling, which is why I ask how The Musketeers did."
The Musketeers,"I love Versailles, I like Outlander, and tried to watch the other three shows you listed but found them unengaging -
 meaning that while watching, I kept stifling the urge to pick up my phone and surf the 'net. Whereas with Versailles I'm always ""Noooo, it's over already?"""
The Musketeers,"I absolutely love this show but haven't seen the final series because I'm too sad it's over. I adore the banter between the Musketeers. And I particularly love Tom Burke as the gloriously angsty Athos. There's some interesting female characters too!

It's one of those shows that I could rely on being a good time each week.

It deserved at least 5 series. :("
The Musketeers,"I loved the show a couple years ago when I watched. It is just as you described it, a fun, light hearted, swashbuckling adventure.

If you have not seen the old Musketeer movies from the 70's, commend them to you. The Three Musketeers and the sequel, the Four Musketeers have that same light hearted and fun feel to them.  My dad showed them to me when I was a little kid and I loved them.  I watched them again a few years ago and they hold up.  They have a great cast with Charlton Heston as Richelieu, Raquel Welch, Faye Dunaway, Michael York, Oliver Reed, Richard Chamberlain and Christopher Lee."
The Musketeers,"I binged the first 2 seasons pretty hard.  It fit what I was looking for, tons of sword fighting and action, good acting and quality.  I really like that the story is not super complicated to follow so I can relax more while watching it and just enjoy it.

Each season is kinda the same though, new evil bad guy, makes muskiteers look bad but eventually they find a way to get rid of him.  I keep comparing it to the A-team only with swords and a long time ago in France. 

Not sure why I felt I needed to comment this, but I did so there ya go."
The Musketeers,"Yes the musketeers is great, I'm so pissed netflix or hulu did not pick it up. Its about one of the best I've seen. Up there with HBO Rome. Reign is for teens if we are talking the CW show. Marco polo was good, but the other characters over shadows Marco Himself. Tried to watch Outlander but Jamie was always getting fucked in the ass and NO BATTLES. I turned it off. "
The Musketeers,My wife and I loved The Musketeers. Maybe my favorite into out of any show.
The Musketeers,You would probably like the old 1970s Richard Lester Musketeers movies *The Three Musketeers* and *The Four Musketeers*. Very similar in tone to the BBC series and were probably the TV show's main inspiration.
The Musketeers,"It was a fun guilty pleasure of mine.  Up there with the Merlin and the new Robin Hood shows.

Fun characters, action, villains and yeah just a fun tv show.

"
The Musketeers,"I didn't even realize the third season had aired in the States.  I watched the first two seasons on BBC America, and was expecting them to drop the third one at some point.  And I also don't have Hulu, only Netflix and Prime.  "
The Musketeers,"I'm watching Versailles now and it's quite good. Reign is basically a soap opera for tweens. 

I'm going to check this out after Versailles!"
The Musketeers,Is it not on US Netflix?
The Musketeers,Period drama - it's a bloody good time 
The Musketeers,"I love Versailles. Definitely a show that's slept on a bit

Production design on that show is top notch and the fact that they actually film at the real French palaces takes it up a level. I'm a 
shameless sucker for history and court intrigue type stuff though

"
The Musketeers,"> and the decors and landscapes are incredible.

My father and I always laughed at the sets because they would have these grand beautiful ballrooms with one chair and one end table in them and nothing else. "
The Musketeers,"Awesome is going a tad far. Its Doctor Who rather than the Expanse, or Merlin rather than Game of Thrones."
The Musketeers,"Have seen all but the last season of Black Sails and plan to watch it at some point.

Is Last Kingdom similar in tone/style to Black Sails? Cause I find the latter significantly „heavier“ (more dark drama, less comedy) than say Musketeers.

I think I‘ll give Outlander a go though, based on what I‘ve heard of it."
The Musketeers,"I’m with you on Black Sails, and it’s all on Amazon Prime Video for anyone that wants to find it..."
The Musketeers,"Black Sails season 1 2 3 are on Netflix for The Netherlands, most def. worth the watch."
The Musketeers,"Ah, good point about the Tudors and Borgia, I‘ve heard about those before. "
The Musketeers,"Borgia, the Showtime version  starring Jeremy Irons, or the other Borgia show?"
The Musketeers,"If you like The Crown and The Tudors, you could try Wolf Hall, with Claire Foy (Elizabeth II in The Crown) as Anne Boleyn, Damian Lewis as Henry VIII, and Mark Rylance as the main character Thomas Cromwell. All three are excellent in it. Only one season though, and they're waiting on the book series to finish before doing more."
The Musketeers,Same. Swordfighting makes everything better and at least 80% more sexy
The Musketeers,r/BritishTV is a good resource for people in the UK or Americans looking for UK TV suggestions. About 75% of my TV watching these days is a British show. Also check out The Guardian and  The Telegraph online (Culture/TV) sections for real time news of what people are watching across the pond. There is a lot of great British TV available. Nice change of pace from the current American dribble. This is also an excellent resource for British crime and mystery television series: http://timbarron.net/entertainment/british-tv-crime-mysteries/
The Musketeers,"> The BBC is producing some of the best television these days, and Americans are overlooking it for some reason

Well, I just looked on Netflix, the show in the title isn't even on there.  It's easy to ignore if it's difficult to acquire.  I'd love to check it out though."
The Musketeers,[deleted]
The Musketeers,"Other people in the thread have mentioned that it's not on Netflix in the US, so that adds to it being harder to discover over there I suppose.   
  
I hadn't heard of it before stumbling upon it on Netflix either."
The Musketeers,"British shows make the Wire seem uplifting by comparison. That they usually have only 6 episodes a season, and the very low budgets makes them not as entertaining as US shows. I enjoyed The Fall, but it was really just 1 season stretched out extremely thinly for 3 years. The Crown felt like a single movie stretched out for 10 hours, with barely any dialogue or plot in each individual episode. It's extremely dreary and depressing."
The Musketeers,yes! was going to suggest this. Plus Richard Armitage as Sir Guy of Gisborne is all sorts of dreamy.
The Musketeers,Sounds like it could be interesting! Thanks :)
The Musketeers,"yep Outlander is a great couples show. War, violence, sex, costumes, time travel, romance/love story, Paris...and even some swordfighting. "
The Musketeers,I second the vikings especially if you enjoy Game of Thrones.
The Musketeers,"Wow that‘s a great overview for the other shows, thank you.

Vikings is more on the „heavier“ side though, or am I mistaken?

More like Black Sails for example, less „fun“/lighthearted?

Edit: would it be worth reading the book before watching Outlander or can I enjoy it just as much if I decide to read the book afterwards?"
The Musketeers,">The four musketeers are excellent (Tom Burke and Santiago Cabrera as Athos and Aramis especially) and every actor they chose as the villain was superb.  
  
Agreed. Lots of great onscreen chemistry. 

> It's a shame Peter Capaldi was only in the first season but I mean he left to be the Doctor so it's completely understandable.   
  
Yeah it took me a bit off guard when the second season opened with his character just being 'gone', especially since the season one finale kind of teased the Cardinal finding out about [S01](#s ""Aramis and the Queen""). So his departure was a bit out of the blue, but I liked that the character was still occasionally mentioned after - and Rochefort, Feron and Grimaud each turned out to be fantastic villains in their own right, and none of them was a carbon copy of another even though they served the same purpose in the narrative, which I thought was nice."
The Musketeers,"Vikings also has a great story arc mixing fact with fiction. Almost a prequel to The Last Kingdom, at least in timeline although Vikings does mash up some of the time and space of the actual events."
The Musketeers,"> Binged the first two seasons but stalled at the beginning of the third with yet another rinse/repeat evil bad guy making life difficult for the Musketeers routine. I did prefer Peter Capaldi in the first season.   
  
I was taken off guard by Capaldi's sudden departure at the start of season 2, but I grew to love (to hate) the other villains almost as much. 

Thanks for the other recs! 

"
The Musketeers,It's on Hulu in the US.
The Musketeers,Oh man...really? I just got psyched to watch this based on OP too. Oh well.
The Musketeers,"You mean the British accents put you off because it‘s set in France? 

Musketeers has that too and it doesn‘t bother me in the least. Any English they speak is inaccurate, so whatever."
The Musketeers,It has an ending and one that I found very satisfying. I may or may not have cried a little.
The Musketeers,I found Versailles by chance and I am really Loving it. Are you through the second season yet?  Just curious if it stays engaging.  
The Musketeers,"I can absolutely recommend watching the final series. It has a good ending and doesn‘t just stop.

But yeah, I agree I would‘ve watched a few more seasons of it."
The Musketeers,"Apparently not, according to other commenters. I wouldn‘t know, I‘m using Netflix Switzerland."
The Musketeers,Its on Hulu
The Musketeers,"I know what you mean but I just can‘t *always* watch the same kind of bleak, serious, depressingly „realistic“ stuff. 

Musketeers might not be awesome in that sense, but it could not have been more perfect for me right now, since I recently just lack the energy for heavier drama shows."
The Musketeers,"Beauty is in the eye of the beholder, my friend."
The Musketeers,"You're nuts, the Crown was one of my top 5 fav shows from last year... it's absolutely brilliant.  I can't wait for S02."
The Musketeers,"I love Doctor Who at least as much as the Expanse, so this doesn't bother me."
The Musketeers,"I'd say Last Kingdom's tone is somewhere between The Musketeers and Black Sails. Drama, sometimes dark, but the main character brings some levity.

"
The Musketeers,"I really enjoyed the Last Kingdom. I would compare it more to Vikings, but more lighthearted. There are some dark parts, but as someone else said, the main character brings some levity.

I throughly enjoyed it."
The Musketeers,"Last kingdom is great also. Tried to watch black sails but a bald black beard? And no beard was stupid and it was like a soft core porn movie. I want to see a story, I can get porn on my computer."
The Musketeers,I also forgot to mention Medici: Masters of Florence on Netflix is also very good. 
The Musketeers,Dont bother with the Borgias IMO. It's more Downton Abbey rather than Tudors set in Italy. It's a soap opera through and through. Reign too is similar. Not to my taste atleast but you can ofcourse judge for yourself. 
The Musketeers,I watched both and enjoyed them equally. 
The Musketeers,"The other Borgia I found much better story-wise, but you can't beat Jeremy Irons as the pope."
The Musketeers,"My other favourite TV categories are ""Medical Drama and Swordfighting"". And ""Travel/Cooking and Swordfighting""."
The Musketeers,"I'm the same way with space ships.

 Show me a trite TV show with paint by numbers plot, shitty dialog and cast of C and D list actors and I'll rant and rave about artistic bankruptcy and what a waste of time it all is.

But put all that in a spaceship with some clunky Nerf guns painted black, bright green CGI laser beams and you've got yourself another fan boy all the way till its inevitable cancellation.

Also yeah swords are sexy as well, which is what I loved Dark Matter even though I will agree with every flaw you care to point out."
The Musketeers,"Thank you, I didn't know about this... I was looking for people who watch UK shows to discuss with."
The Musketeers,Do you think the shows they choose to air on PBS are the best of all the UK series?  It seems like they tend to choose most of the ones that I love.
Madoka Magica,"For any of you r/television junkies, lemme just say right now.

Mob Psycho 100 is one of the best anime series I've ever watched, and although Fullmetal Brotherhood is my favorite *story*, I think Mob might be my favorite anime of all time.

Between Doctor Who, Doom Patrol and Harley Quinn and now this, HBO Max has been crushing it with it's lineup."
Madoka Magica,Is The Promised Neverland any good? Keeps popping up in different threads that I'm browsing
Madoka Magica,"The Streaming Wars may get some flack but I for one have been loving it. Because every time I do the math, getting several Streaming Services always adds up to being much less than paying for Cable/Dish."
Madoka Magica,time to rewatch mob then. and promise neverland been on my list for a while now it is easier to use
Madoka Magica,Holy cow! Now this is what I'm talking about! Finally I can enjoy season 2 of Mob Psycho without relying on my boyfriend's VRV account!
Madoka Magica,Oh sweet. I liked Aldnoah.Zero.
Madoka Magica,Shame its not available here
Madoka Magica,So are these shows being pulled from Crunchy and Funi?
Madoka Magica,"The frustrating thing about this is its unclear what options they're adding these with.  The existing series seem to be a scattershot of subbed and dubbed versions, but the exclusively English-dubbed ones are missing English-subtitles, missing even closed-captions for the hearing impaired."
Madoka Magica,"Adding to this, Mob Psycho 100 is a must watch if you like anime in any capacity. S2 has one of the best fight scenes in anime period. Not only that but it's actually a well-written slice of life that most other animes can't even scratch the surface of. You'll like it if you're into the parody style of OPM (I mean, written by the same guy), you'll like it if you're into Studio Ghibli-esque stuff (think of the end scene of first ep s2), you'll like it if you're into any ordinary shonen, it legit has that kinda appeal. The shows only barrier to entry is the art style, but you get over it after an ep or 2."
Madoka Magica,Facts 🔥🔥🔥
Madoka Magica,"Owning at least half of those IPs is a good way to have them.

Having bought one of the two major anime import streaming services is another good way."
Madoka Magica,Harley Quinn is on Max now?
Madoka Magica,They have the best lineup of all the streaming apps in my opinion.
Madoka Magica,"Watching through Mob Pyscho 100 now - THANK YOU! I'm only on season one, episode eight, but I'm completely hooked."
Madoka Magica,That’s a convincing plug. I’ll watch it.
Madoka Magica,"Just googled it and it looks like they put a My Hero Academia costume on Saitama from OPM, is this intentional?!"
Madoka Magica,highly recommend it
Madoka Magica,"I'm pretty critical with animes, I think most modern popular ones kinda suck, but Promised Neverland is very well written, I gave it an A or 9/10."
Madoka Magica,"Yes and no, the first season is fan-fucking-tastic and I'd highly recommend it. However the source Manga it's based off of... It... Drops the really hard after the first arc. So basically I'd highly recommend the first season (and so far only season) and just leave it at that. The rest of the story in the Manga has the fastest drop in quality I've ever seen."
Madoka Magica,The first arc is killer but the decline in quality after it is overwhelming. It gets really bad at some points.
Madoka Magica,Very very good
Madoka Magica,It's based off a *very* good manga arc and does it to a inferior degree. The manga also strictly dipped in quality after that first arc so the anime is likely to follow suit. Overall it's quite good but definitely not worthy of any *the next best anime* hype you may be coming across.
Madoka Magica,I agree. Plus there is so much more good content these days imo than there was 10+ years ago.
Madoka Magica,You don't have many streaming services or aren't counting internet costs
Madoka Magica,"No. Both HBO Max and Crunchyroll are owned by AT&T. Their plan seems to be for HBO Max to have some anime, but Crunchyroll/VRV will be the their main anime streaming service. Aside from the Ghibli movies, all anime on HBO Max should be on Crunchyroll. The Funimation shows should be fine until the current licensing deals expire, but even then they should be fine. Madoka Magica, for example, is an Aniplex show, and both Aniplex and Funimation are owned by Sony, so that'll stay on Funi."
Madoka Magica,"While the art style could be seen as a barrier, I personally find it to be one of the show’s most endearing traits."
Madoka Magica,"> Having bought one of the two major anime import streaming services 

What is the other major services"
Madoka Magica,Coming in August.
Madoka Magica,It ain't on mine
Madoka Magica,"“Wow. Look at what you’ve done. This has never happened while I’m conscious before.”

That scene gave me chillllllllls."
Madoka Magica,The original manga was made by the same guy as One Punch Man.
Madoka Magica,"I think the second major arc is still pretty good (although nowhere near as good as the first), but yeah, everything after that isn’t really worth it."
Madoka Magica,It really felt like the author had a great concept to start a story but had no idea what they should do after that part was over.
Madoka Magica,Should be noted that the anime only contains the first arc
Madoka Magica,i only use the main sub services. i dont use niche stuff like crunchy roll or criterion. hbo max netflix is more than enough for me. disney plus suck ass for a single adult. but family wise it is nice to have.
Madoka Magica,"The average cable bill is over $200 (source [https://decisiondata.org/news/report-the-average-cable-bill-now-exceeds-all-other-household-utility-bills-combined/](https://decisiondata.org/news/report-the-average-cable-bill-now-exceeds-all-other-household-utility-bills-combined/))

For internet on it's own I typically pay under $70. I'm certainly not spending $130 on streaming services and I'm typically subscribed to 4-6 of them, which is probably more than most people."
Madoka Magica,"To me its a lot like One Piece. Jarring at first, but it makes it stand out, and once you start to like everything else about it, you become attached to the style associated with it"
Madoka Magica,I think he is referring to Crunchyroll and Funimation? I know Crunchyroll falls under WarnerMedia and I think Funimation is owned by Sony.
Madoka Magica,It comes early next month
Madoka Magica,Bummer
Madoka Magica,"It's made by the same author of One Punch Man.

Whereas for OPM they adapted the anime to look more like the redrawn manga, Mob Psycho tried to adapt ONE's art style into the series.

OPM was a new take on superheroes, MOB is a new take on psychic powers. 

Some of the fight scenes in Mob *easily* rival OPM, too, but there's so much fucking heart whereas OP is more, I dunno, wacky?

EDIT: I dunno why this got added as a reply to you, RegularJoe. It was supposed to be to saul, but good to see you already answered it. :D"
Madoka Magica,"I really don't think this was the case.

The Promised Neverland really had the potential to be a significantly longer series, maybe not One Piece but around Naruto level, it's just the author kind of gave up in the middle of it. Almost every major plot thread does not pay off and we're left with a series that starts off really cool but isn't worth it. In a lot of ways like GoT."
Madoka Magica,"There are like 4ish main ones now? Netflix, Hulu, Amazon Prime, and HBOMax? Then include Disney+. At least 50.50/mo + internet? More if you want higher quality and more limited commercials."
Madoka Magica," imo you only need two a month and i use amazon prime  other things beside tv so it not really put in the tv sub section it more of a costco/samclub membership for me. then change the secondary subscription every few months based on your needs. i feel netflix is essesntial since they actually release new content every week and at least once of a month i hear culture defining show or critic darling from them. hulu doesnt have a good tv show every single month and for live tv i can just use an digital antenna, amazon tv doesnt anything killer, and then disney plus never releases new content aimed for adults minus mando which was up until december then two months off until clone wars and then like 2 months off until hamilton. there are internet bundles that is 50 dollars a month plus the 50.50 that is 100 dollars essential with the full package of networks. with 1 or 2 sub it is 70 dollars still."
Madoka Magica,The top 8 stream platforms cost $59.94+tax a month if you are willing to use annual plans and the ad-supported plans.  I'd personally never count internet in the cost of streaming because I'd have internet regardless of whether or not I had any streaming service.
Madoka Magica,">I'd personally never count internet in the cost of streaming

 Inherently wrong. You can't use streaming services without internet, and possibly higher internet than you otherwise would have.

>The top 8 stream platforms cost $59.94+tax a month

If you use questionable math I assume. I already listed but 5 and it was 60$. I don't think the next 3 are only going to be $10/mo. CBS all access is another 6 by itself"
Madoka Magica,"No reason to count the cost of internet if you were going to have it regardless of streaming services.

&#x200B;

Netflix $8.99, Amazon $8.99, Hulu $5.99 w/ ads, Apple TV+ $4.99, CBS All Access $5.00 w/ ads, Peacock Premium w/ ads $4.17, HBOMAX $14.99, Disney+ $5.83."
Madoka Magica,">No reason to count the cost of internet if you were going to have it regardless of streaming services.

 Decent internet is a required cost of streaming. 

>Netflix $8.99

1 device in *SD*. I don't know who would have this, but ok, sure, with that savings, you come under 60"
Madoka Magica,"Madoka Magica is one of those shows that has a tendency to stick because of that unique art style and surprisingly surreal disturbing content.

If you have not watched it, imagine it as if David Lynch is trying to create a magical girl show. It ain't Sailor Moon."
Madoka Magica,"Okay, some questions:

1. Is Gen Urobuchi returning to write? Because if he's not then I am so not interested. The last time Urobuchi didn't write a follow up to his work, we got Psycho Pass season 2 (and it wasn't that good)

2. Will this story be starting around where Rebellion ended or is this something else (like a 'what-if')?"
Madoka Magica,"I do not know about the first question.

All I know is that it takes place somewhere in the main canon? Which iteration of the universe is uncertain...

But it is being well received in Japan so far and there had been ads for the game that feature 2018 Pyeongchang gold medalist Alina Zagitova.

Monster Math Squad,"This show brings out the weirdest sentiment in the fandom.  Even after S1 where the writers basically beat you over the head with the idea of ""there's nothing as sinister as you think at work here, these are just normal everyday people that kinda suck"" people have been predicting that every other character is a secret sociopath/violent incel/rapist in every other thread.  It's like they forgot the first season or the general tone of the show ever happened. Like the show sub is Tumblr level wild with its theorizing and characterizations."
Monster Math Squad,"I'm definitely eager to see how they wrap everything up. I think there is a lot more to resolve this season than last.

I do think that the show purposefully establishes plot devices and expect to see the following things come to bear in the finale:

* Ethan believing something happened between Cameron and Harper
* Cameron still owing Lucia money
* Dominic and Albie having both slept with Lucia (unbeknowest to Albie)
* The gun that Tanya finds in the last episode
* The picture of Quentin and Greg together"
Monster Math Squad,"I am totally convinced that Tanya will be the end of Quentin if not Greg too (who may not reveal his presence, but he might if he's confident that he's got power over Tanya with the sex tape). I think that Quentin and Greg both underestimate Tanya because of her daffy, clueless persona. ""Queen of Sicily,"" etc. But they fail to realize that she is actually the biggest predator in their group: her self-involvement, her ruthless commitment to herself at others' expense, has been a devouring force laying waste to everyone around her since Season 1. So of course her self-preservation is going to kick in. When the drugs wear off she'll go back to look at that photo. She's going to trick the men into getting off the boat for a ""swim"" first--their idea of a way to stage her suicide by drowning is for everybody to go swimming--and then pull up the ladder and wave good-bye. Which is what I think she's probably doing in the subliminally brief glimpse in the Ep. 7 trailer. I wouldn't put it past her to leave Portia to drown too, if she's unlucky enough to be there."
Monster Math Squad,I wonder if Dominic is going to commit suicide… I mean this season is doing a lot of Godfather references and Dom had a bowl of them right by him at the end of episode 5 (?). Huge foreshadow if they’re paying homage to The Godfather in that sense.
Monster Math Squad,"The thing I can't get over with this article, and the theorizing in general with this season, is that at no point in episode 1 does anyone say the bodies are a result of murder. Season 1 did not have a murder; everyone jumped to conclusions that a coffin = a murder. The same thing is happening with this season. We have no reason to believe anyone will be murdered.

The best theories I've heard so far relate to Cameron and Ethan recklessly driving jetskis resulting in their deaths, and Grandpa DiGrasso dying from old age/accident. I also love the (non-death) theory that the party in Palermo is Greg's way of giving Tanya her Italian fantasy before breaking some kind of bad news to her."
Monster Math Squad,"The subplot regarding Valentina´s crush (the receptionist)... seems so unrelated to the main stories that I think it will play a bigger role at the end... otherwise, feels way to ""meh"" to the rest of the story... if you eliminate it, so far wouldn't affect the story over all.

In Mia´s and Lucia´s first appearance in episode 1, Lucia says ""Bye Ale"" and Alessio is seen in the background, it seems they are in super friendly terms, so for sure she is playing Albie into making him think she is being Alessio´s victim.

Niccolo´s (the gigolo/drug dealer)´s gun will play some important role, Chekov´s gun...

The Greg/cowboy theory seems too heavy handed , that I think they are misleading us... is like in Dexter when it turned Edward James Olmos was dead the whole time, killed by Colin Hanks character... by the time of the plot twist the whole audience knew it... so I think it would be to predictable and this writers know better.

It's been announced that a 3rd season will have a 100% new cast, so perhaps its the end of Tanya, let's hope not. It would be great if she is the main character having adventures on all the White Lotuses resorts around the world."
Monster Math Squad,"This season has definitely been more “tame” than last and contrary to popular opinion, I feel it’s been somewhat boring. Hoping the finale will have a bit of excitement, obviously answer who the dead body was in the opener, and finish out with a bang."
Monster Math Squad,"OK, it is time to put cards on the  table.

My vote?

OK. Cameron, Ethan and Haley die at the end.

Albie and  Lucia' s alleged pimp have a show down.

Albie wins and Lucia is  his trophy wife.

I predict that Tanya, though being played by Greg  and her gay friends, emerges triumphant.

I could be so  wrong, but here is my hand"
Monster Math Squad,"I think Ethan is going to have a psychotic break and kill Lucia in their room, thinking she is Harper. And the high class guys will die on the yacht, which will be blown up for insurance purposes. Tanya will somehow survive.

On the other hand...

character wise, I think Jack dies via the gun, because he's such a tragic character."
Monster Math Squad,"Throw enough shit, something will stick- like the cowboy theory lol."
Monster Math Squad,"This season upped the ante with the number of deaths it promised, so it invites a more sinister reading than what happened in the first season. Even if it ends up subverting that."
Monster Math Squad,I think he’s going to commit suicide too. What is The Godfather reference you mentioned?
Monster Math Squad,"I am leaning into this theory too. Dominic is in a serious cycle of addiction and shame. He also continues to blame his dad which tells me that he isn't taking much accountability for his actions which would also reflect a shame cycle and denial of the pain HE caused. He also seems to have moments where he disassociates and you are kinda left to speculate where his head went. Like, right after he tried to call his wife and she was screaming at him on the phone. I definitely think he is in a deep depression and can't control the spiral he is in."
Monster Math Squad,"Huh? The couple at the airport in the beginning of Season 1 said that someone was *killed* at the resort, there's a tiny bit of ambiguity there but I think most people agree that pretty much 100% indicates murder. The coffin ended up containing the corpse of Armand, and his death was a (arguably justified) homicide.

Then in Season 2, same word choice. After Daphne finds a dead body in the ocean, Rocco tells Val, ""One guest has drowned [... and] other guests have been *killed*."" (And when asked how many total, he says 'a few', so I feel like there could be more than 3 fatalities)

If you think no one is going to die by the hand of another human  this season, idk if we're watching the same show lol"
Monster Math Squad,They did say one guest drowned…
Monster Math Squad,"> This season has definitely been more “tame” than last and contrary to popular opinion, I feel it’s been somewhat boring.

I'm not so sure I would go so far as to label this season more ""tame"" than S1 (though I am at a loss at this point to characterize it) nonetheless I can say with out reservation Aubrey Plaza America's sweetheart notwithstanding S2 is no Connie Britton, ALEXANDRA DADDARIO, SYDNEY SWEENEY and Brittany O'Grady."
Monster Math Squad,I still don’t believe that Greg was worth pining over for decades. A man who’d die for beauty wants him? *Him?*
Monster Math Squad,"100%.  The cowboy theory is absolutely the exception to the rule of my criticism, but they *did* lean in to it pretty heavily.


But for every one of those you have ""Cam raped Ethan in college"" and ""Albie is an incel"" and ""Daphne is actually a sociopath because she said she likes Dateline murder episodes."""
Monster Math Squad,I still can’t believe someone called that
Monster Math Squad,"Also, the first season was about class, the wealthy guests of the resort vs the staff. And the way that the wealthy can just go about their lives with little to no consequences. So it makes sense that a guest murders a staff person in a situation that he almost definitely won't have major consequences for.
This season is clearly a different theme. It's way more focused on sexual/romantic relationships and jealousy/infidelity. We also know that not only are there more deaths, but they are all guests."
Monster Math Squad,"There’s a bowl of oranges, my bad. In The Godfather most of the characters who’s death was foreshadowed by an orange in a scene earlier in the movie."
Monster Math Squad,"""Killed"" could just as easily refer to an accident as a murder to me. You'd say people were killed in a plane crash, or a boat crash. I don't think that nobody is going to ""die by the hand of another human"" but I think that *only* thinking that can mean murder is too narrow for this show."
Monster Math Squad,Lololol. He was pretty cute in the Monster Squad.
Monster Math Squad,Exactly ..ewww
Monster Math Squad,"""well he got old"""
Monster Math Squad,I totally missed the cowboy reference til I saw it online
Monster Math Squad,"I mean, they did have Albie say he was a ""nice guy."" But then the plot decided not to lean into that direction. It wasn't some crazy theory"
Monster Math Squad,"Perhaps this season, it’s the white female that gets away with it?"
Monster Math Squad,What other godfather references were there? I haven’t seen The Godfather since the movie first came out.
Monster Math Squad,"I can admit that line of thinking is too narrow for reality, but the last time someone was reported as 'killed' in *The White Lotus*, it was because someone got stabbed"
Monster Math Squad,"No, Portia called him a nice guy"
Monster Math Squad,"Tanyas wearing the dress the mannequin has on in the white car, (at the godfather tourist attraction / forgot the name) and then Portia is having breakfast with Tanya and is wearing a godfather t shirt. Couple of nods there but would love to hear more!"
Monster Math Squad,I think the grandpa was watching it in his room one-night.
Monster Math Squad,Maybe they try to kill Tanya but Portia accidentally gets it instead?
Monster Math Squad,"All of us are dead…that much rating? No, it belong to the worst honestly."

Monster Math Squad,"I'll admit I haven'y seen most of these, but I 100% agree with your assessments on the ones I *have* seen. Severance was like a breath of fresh air! Unique, evocative, and humanist. It asks and answers the question: what if we had the ability to manage our pain in a completely nihilistic way? Who would do it and why? The characters, the acting, the symbolisms of the color schemes, the mystery, the horror...Ben Stiller is soooo good behind the camera. And if you like his sensibilities here, check out Escape from Danemora, a biopic abt the woman who helped 2 men escape a high security prison. Also with Patricia Arquette. Ben Stiller directed. This show is one of my top 5 favs this year. 

I usually LOVE shows like From. Unfortunately, it was lacking everything you mentioned. It made a really good premise feel trite and boring :/. 

A show you didn't mention but deserves to be here is Physical on AppleTV. Omg SO GOOD. Rose Byrne (love her!) is a woman with severe eating disorder (tw) who falls into 80s aerobics stardom. It's funny, it's sad, it's entertaining, and if you are someone who has had intrusive thoughts abt your physical appearance and laments what your past decisions have cost you in your life while trying to improve your current situation, this show will speak to you.

Peacemaker is HILARIOUS and surprising. Also in my top 5 this year. Pam and Tommy was good, not great, but I was entertained enough to watch it all. Gave me a whole diff perspective on Pam Anderson and left me feeling angry that no one went to jail over the theft!"
Monster Math Squad,"Don't agree with you on Bang Bang Baby. Thought it was executed magnificently but agree it could have been tighter. It was produced by the same guy who produced My Brilliant Friend and Young Pope. He also produced The King which came out this year. Think you'd love it: https://youtu.be/soami2tlDH4

Pachinko and Severance were great. The Tourist would have been great with a showrunner and writer like Steven Moffat. Could have been the British/ Aussie Fargo. Conversations with Friends was a waste of time. The book is untranslatable to screen but they still went with it. Peacemaker was great and had heart which was super surprising. Can't wait for the next season!"
Monster Math Squad,"I like ""workin moms"" on Netflix.  Good 30 minute comedy."
Monster Math Squad,"**THESE WERE OK:**

* Power Book IV: Force (Starz)

For a Power series I will say this Tommy Egan spinoff does do justice to the franchise's most beloved character. The tone is more consistent, the plot is more street-focused unlike the original and other spinoffs which tends to lose themselves in legal and family drama, and the show sets up a good environment for our main character to strive. His funny dialogue is still on point too of course, so is Joseph Sikora's comedic timing. The major downside here is that essentially 'Force' still very much is a Power series, and there's nothing here that you'll feel like you haven't seen before. It also comes with the same flaw as the rest of them, where it seems the plot just predictably goes around in circles, with almost all the side characters either destined for some kind of betrayal, or death.

rating: 6.7 out of 10

* Life After Life (BBC Two)

A science-fiction period-drama that follows the story of Ursula Todd, a woman in the first half of the 20th century who experiences an endless cycle of birth, death and rebirth. This premise does sound promising on paper, but the way it plays out is also the downside of watching this series. Don't get me wrong, there are times when this is fascinating, specifically the times where we watch our main character be reborn and take a different trajectory in life as an almost whole new person, as she learns from the mistakes she made in previous lives, but for a lot of its short runtime, the series really knocks you over the head with the concept, as we watch her die and be reborn again and again to the point where it becomes redundant. The visuals has its moments for a low-budget production, and there are moments where the series hits emotional marks, but by the end of it, you might be left wondering ""what exactly was the point of this?""

rating: 6.7 out of 10

* Shining Vale (Starz)

Shining Vale actually starts out pretty interesting, as a 30-minute comedy that mixes horror and psychology in quite a unique way, with witty dialogue that surprisingly never misses. But the issue is as you continue watching, there are way too many cliches here, which makes the core plot very predictable and stale. At least that's how I felt watching another show centered around the life of a writer, even if she's seeing ghosts.

rating: 6.8 out of 10

* Barons (ABC)

It's definitely something you watch more for the vibes as oppose to for the storytelling, and Barons really does capture that 70s hippie/surfer life vibe and aesthetic quite well. An Australian drama centered around surfers with a little bit of everything, from rivalries, to romances, to business, and even crime etc. Barons is mostly an easy-going type of series that pulls out the soap opera-esque moment here and there. Does it work? Well that's up to the type of mood you're in, but at times it may feel like not much is happening here until something crazy and unexpected does. And there are many different locations here as well as the story takes us from Australia, to Indonesia, to the U.S.A. (though obviously entirely filmed in Australia) with lovely beach views and surfing scenes... though at times it does feel like this series may be too ambitious for its own good. The acting is definitely a weak point, and it cause certain scenes to miss there mark, lacking that emotional punch great actors could've given them, but overall I'd say this series is a mixed bag. Enjoyable but flawed.

rating: 7.2 out of 10

* Les 7 vies de Léa (Netflix)

With quite a fun concept to work with, involving both time-traveling and body-swapping (something almost like '17 Again' or 'Freaky Friday' but not exactly), Les 7 vies de Léa is a mostly good show... but with some downsides. The good? It's entertaining, mysterious, quite unpredictable, filled with 90s nostalgia, and sets up explorations of teen mental health. The downsides? It doesn't reach the emotional and sentimental heights it obviously aims for, and that's mainly due to the script not taking time out to let the viewers get to know and connect with the suicidal main character (Lea)... that is, her life and who she was before this whole ordeal, and why she feels the way that she does. We get an in-depth look at a few others characters and their woes, but not with her, which makes the decision she makes at the end not have quite the effect that was intended.

rating: 7.0 out of 10

* Surviving Summer (Netflix)

A fun young-adult drama with some amazingly shot surf scenes (way better than the ones in Barons), which left me wondering if they used CGI. The acting is definitely a noticeable weak point, but the cast is young. And the premise, a troubled teen being sent away to an exotic location where she'll learn to be a better person, is something we've seen before, but it doesn't hinder this teen-drama filled with surf competitions from being a good enough watch.

rating: 6.7 out of 10"
Monster Math Squad,Looks like someone still needs to watch *This Is Going to Hurt*!
Monster Math Squad,Severance show
Monster Math Squad,"You wildin' fam. I know that one paragraph didn't elaborate much (*plan on doing a rewatch and writing a full review sometime*), but All of Us Are Dead is fantastic! Definitely my fav of the year so far. 

Only flaws I can think of is those crappy looking moments where there's bad CGI. But visually I think those tracking shots made up for it. 

Why didn't u like it?"
Monster Math Squad,lol why the hate for All -- Dead?
Monster Math Squad,Thanks. I've been meaning to check out Physical (along with some other Apple TV+ originals I missed out on) but haven't gotten the chance to yet. But that show is from last year so it wouldn't be on this list anyways.
Monster Math Squad,"I've never even heard of thaf show before now. But it ain't too late, I'll watch it and probably update the list."
Monster Math Squad,"I don’t care for the CGI or technical issues, nor the not well acting or not very good directing. The story, the story was very bad from beginning to end. Zero originality, the only were the ones who stayed normal being zombies, they didn’t have sense. There are many better anime or manga about zombies and school, especially with better characters and relationships. The part outside also was kind of pointless and really not interesting for me. I was really bored by it. And yes kind of poor realization then. But honestly storyline and development really disappointed me. 
No offense, I mean, you said it was the best for you for this year and it’s fine of course. That was just my opinion."
Monster Math Squad,"because its not good?

horrible writing, bad acting, trope infested, nothing original, not well shot... where the hell do you get a 9.3 for such a mediocre show?"
Monster Math Squad,Yes but they released s2 this year =)
Monster Math Squad,idk man to each his own. don't you think this was better than Highschool of the Dead though?
Monster Math Squad,"I'm literally the opposite of you on this one. Maybe if you thought it was ""*ok, not great*"" i wouldn't be surprised, but ""not good""?? Did you watch the show in dub or somethn? lol. 

Sure it's not the most original thing (I even mentioned *Highschool of the Dead* in the review), and it's definitely a trope-fest, but it still had some very inventive ideas and scenes. And it might not be the most original, but it's unique in the sense that it's multifaceted. 

It's... a teen-drama more than anything, even those it has political side stories to give a fuller scope of the situation. It starts as a teen-drama, and when the Zombie apocalypse happens, it doesn't stop being a teen-drama. Their conflicts, their relationships, their love interests etc., all of this is just forced under new deadly circumstances, so you'd have to actually care about all the silly crushes and the bullying and all that before it does. That's what fuels the story. 

> not well shot

Nah this is just wrong. Did you see those tracking shots!!?? 😩

But anyway, Severance and All Of Us Are Dead is just a 0.5 difference in rating. I absolutely loved both shows. Severance definitely have the best episode out of each too (the finale). I just found a teeny bit more fault with Severance (*mainly regarding production design*), thus it being half a point less."
Monster Math Squad,"No, HotD was a lot of fun, interesting, never boring or annoying, cool action scenes and cool characters as well, very enjoyable and not for the sizes of the girls."
Monster Math Squad,"c'mon man. everything you just said about H.O.T.D. can be said about All -- Dead. 😅 

I like H.O.T.D. but I actually like this one a bit more because it has more emotional depth. H.O.T.D. didn't have scenes like the one where the group were leaving their final messages to their families on a camcorder, not knowing if they were still alive or if they themselves would make it. It didn't have scenes like On-jo and Cheong-san's last conversation, or On-jo watching her father get devoured, or the final scene with all of them on the roof. H.O.T.D. was a bit too focused on giving us action sequences, you couldn't connect to the characters the same way you could here the way I see it. 

And it's not just the sad parts either, I think the youthfulness that stays with the characters even while going through the worst event of their lives is what makes them whole."
Monster Math Squad,"I know I'm in the minority but I was genuinely upset his character survived. I have no desire to see a show try and redeem him. 

For those who do, I hope you enjoy."
Monster Math Squad,Cena gonna be peacemaker between his  country China and our country Taiwan?
Monster Math Squad,"I gotta be honest, I didn’t think his performance was all that (didn’t think the film was anything special either)."
Monster Math Squad,[deleted]
Monster Math Squad,They made a show out of the character I wanted to see less of in the movie he was in? lmao...
Monster Math Squad,"Not watching this China lovers show, sorry.

Free Hong Kong
Free Taiwan"
Monster Math Squad,So he's not going to be haunted by the ghost of his Nazi father?  That was the best thing about the comic version.
Monster Math Squad,Yeah was hoping it was Flagg.
Monster Math Squad,"Honestly, I was miffed as well, but I'm really curious where they take him because I feel like you simply *can't* redeem his character, which tracks with the leaks I've heard."
Monster Math Squad,"Wait a minute, am I going insane? I thought Peacemaker died. He was shot in that scene where the bullets crossed or whatever."
Monster Math Squad,">I know I'm in the minority but I was genuinely upset his character survived. I have no desire to see a show try and redeem him. 

Interesting to me you are assuming that he gets redeemed."
Monster Math Squad,"I don’t think anyone is actually bothered about redeeming him, or actual story.

I think this is just more of what we already saw which was a pretty funny character

I’m all for more Superhero stories that just have fun with it"
Monster Math Squad,"I totally get this, and I hope they don't go the redemption arc, but I'm excited to see the show. In the first half of the movie I kind of blew his character off as comic relief but the back half...wow. Cena impressed me. I like him as a guy but never thought of him as a serious actor until now, his portrayal was really compelling."
Monster Math Squad,"I felt like this but tbh the show is actually good. I can see why Gunn wanted to make it, he had an actual story and neat characters"
Monster Math Squad,"That’s a clever joke.

Reddit and beating a dumb joke to death, name a better duo."
Monster Math Squad,"I don’t think it’s as simple as “good or bad”.

They’ve seen first hand what Starro can do, and the fact Waller only wants them there to delete any ties to the US clearly pissed them off. She lied to them and got more of their team killed because of it.

Coincidentally the line from Guardians of the Galaxy applies here. It makes sense to save the world because you are one of the people who live in it."
Monster Math Squad,turns out the world doesn't revolve around what you want
Monster Math Squad,Taiwan is it's own country.  It was the british that gave hong kong to china.  James gunn had nothing to do with it.
Monster Math Squad,Me too
Monster Math Squad,"They can redeem his character ""to an extent"". There are much more pos characters in comic books/graphic novels who has done much worse shit than peacemaker who has got their redemption arc of their own."
Monster Math Squad,There's post credit scene confirming he's alive
Monster Math Squad,Then that just makes me ask what's the point even more? What is his character arc? Ya know what? I don't care. I literally don't have the capacity to care about the peacemaker show lol
Monster Math Squad,"It just didn't work for me. If you go full villain like that, then you gotta die. Not only did he murder Rick Flagg in gratuitous fashion, but then he was going to murder rat catcher as well (rat catcher should have died instead of polka dot man but that's another debate).

His character was comic relief until he was a villain. The conflicted stuff didn't jive with me either. There's lots in the movie that doesn't sit right with me. Like Rick Flagg being part of the expendable team in the beginning. Amanda Waller clearly wanted Rick Flagg dead. Or at least it seems that way but it's never actively brought up. Idk man, I was trying to keep my og comment civil but I really disliked the suicide squad. And I dislike it more when I really start to think about it."
Monster Math Squad,[removed]
Monster Math Squad,Reddit and being populated with armchair experts is another one.
Monster Math Squad,If he said he loved peacemaker he’d be the top rated comment
Monster Math Squad,Was referring to Cena
Monster Math Squad,"In comics, over decades, I get that. It's just hard in movies and television. Ya know? There's not gonna be a ten year gap and a new team of creatives coming in to change the character. It's the same team working on him."
Monster Math Squad,"Oh man, how did I miss that...."
Monster Math Squad,"I mean have you really never seen a piece of media or absorbed a story where you start with a character that ends the story the same place or worse than when it started? And media about bad people exist, like Dexter, American psycho, Joker etc. Just because he's a bad guy doesn't mean you can't do interesting and compelling things with the character outside of just getting redeemed."
Monster Math Squad,"Them murdering the entire village and it being played as a gag is fine dark humour.

But you can't expect me to like those characters after."
Monster Math Squad,"Looked to me like peacemaker was super conflicted with killing Flagg and probably hated himself for it.  Though your right about rat catcher, that was about to be an execution.  He didn't do it but thats pretty irredeemable."
Monster Math Squad,"> If you go full villain like that, then you gotta die

Is Loki dead?"
Monster Math Squad,"Yep, Reddit is the place to solve your issues with politics.

This is a subreddit for Tv shows talking about a Tv show.

But sure, keep talking about democracy and communism because an actor from said Tv show once had to apologize to China because he likes money.

Does your political comment make you feel better? Does it help at all? Or are you just trying to talk politics when everyone else is talking about a Tv show?

Edit: don’t feed the trolls kids"
Monster Math Squad,"Not really, there are many graphic novels which run for few years or so under the same creative which has these type of stories. They don't try to fully redeem them but instead try to flesh out the characters which in turn make that character a bit likeable , enough to make the readers continue to follow the protagonist's journey. For example, Black Adam, a character who has genocided thousands of people just for revenge and blood lust but also did heroic things when he was a member of JL/JSA.Punpun from Oyasumi Punpun is a pos  and is the protagonist of the story. But people still sympathize with him to some extent. Atleast Peacemaker has some remorse and he knows what he is doing is wrong which can be seen from his expression while killing flag. But he is delusional. Out of all the characters in TSS, only Peacemaker was the most complex and compelling character .Blood sport is the same old mercenary villain just like many other character from the comics.But ultimately it depends upon taste. I love to watch a show with anti heroic/villainous protagonist."
Monster Math Squad,You might have bailed out at the weasel post credit scene. Which was at the midway point. This one was at the very end.
Monster Math Squad,"Peacemaker isnt compelling, his skillset is someone elses. He's a douchebag. And you can't trust him. He's third rate getting top billed."
Monster Math Squad,"Like, I'm down with dastardly characters. I was pissed off Amanda Waller didn't kill all those annoying it people when they turned on her. Her killing them would have been in keeping with the Amanda Waller character. But nope, she just assigns them to peacemaker. 

So it all just looks like it's setting up the peacemaker show and so, you have to negate the things that story dictates should happen, just to squeeze another tv show out of it."
Monster Math Squad,I'm sorry for replying to you so many times.
Monster Math Squad,"I commented on that. It's how he's presented. All we have is the one movie with him. Like, ignore the fact that every damn character in the world gets their own show these days. Within this movie, he betrays his team, kills the only good guy, the only non villain in the movie, and does so in pretty big way. Then, he's about to kill a villain, yeah, but the one who is the only empathetic villain of the bunch. 

But hey, he said those dick jokes in the beginning,. So that makes me want to see more of him."
Monster Math Squad,"I watch a lot of stuff that features characters I don't like. And I can be invested in their bad journey. But the suicide squad wanted to have it's cake and eat it too. Half measures. And because of that it just felt like a tonal mess. 

I've never done a video essay but my feelings on this movie and the way it's lived in my mind make me want to haha"
Monster Math Squad,"Yeah. He looked conflicted. But immediately went to kill rat catcher. 

I was bothered by the x-ray shot too. It's like, you're killing the only ""good"" person in the movie and instead of it being a moment, we revel in the violence. 

Flagg's final line is an all-timer though."
Monster Math Squad,"Coulson was ressurected immediately. And Loki was killed. Also, coulson's death was used as a lightning rod to bring the avengers together.

Also, the one we have now is not the Loki we had then."
Monster Math Squad,That’s a lot of typing.
Monster Math Squad,"I liked Dexter, breaking bad, Scarface, etc. I like plenty of stuff about unrepentant characters. But those characters are often interesting and original. Peacemaker is literally introduced as a gag about DC third tier villains. And then he's just awful throughout the movie. There was nothing there that made me, personally, feel like I wanted to spend a whole show with him. 

I don't mind watching Walter white let jane die because that is a huge character moment for him and establishes walt as a real bastard villain. 

Peacemaker is already a bastard when we meet him and then he goes and kills the only good character in the movie. To protect govt secrets. 

And now he's clearly still working for the govt. I'm just not into it. I said earlier if you are, that's cool.  

Maybe I just liked Rick Flagg too much. Maybe I just disliked the suicide squad too much. But I just don't give a damn about a peacemaker show lol"
Monster Math Squad,"the scene where the tech woman [spoiler](#s ""cracks Waller on the back of the head with the baseball bat(?)"") is one of the best scenes in the film.  it was one of THE most satisfying moments in a film or tv show i've seen in a while. LOL."
Mighty Morphin Power Rangers,"I was wondering what the two Power Rangers Movie thing will tie up to. Also the word ""Kill"" showing up in power rangers is bizarre to me. lol Can't wait."
Mighty Morphin Power Rangers,What about Bulk and Skull
Mighty Morphin Power Rangers,Those suits must slim you down when you put them on.
Mighty Morphin Power Rangers,Bold move having a major motivation being Trini getting killed. Love it being called the Bandora Protocol.
Mighty Morphin Power Rangers,Zordon couldn't recruit some new child soldiers in 30 years?
Mighty Morphin Power Rangers,Glad David Yost came back as the Blue Ranger. All the stories about the ways he was mistreated for being gay during the original show were heartbreaking.
Mighty Morphin Power Rangers,I loved being a kid and waking up Saturday mornings to watch this. I can't wait for this to come out.
Mighty Morphin Power Rangers,I'm proud they chose to keep the cheesy element in there. Was worried they actually try to do something like Logan
Mighty Morphin Power Rangers,Man I wish Tommy was able to be the green ranger in this. He deserved a finally
Mighty Morphin Power Rangers,Zack better hit me with some Hip-Hop Kido. IDC.
Mighty Morphin Power Rangers,Zack still fine.
Mighty Morphin Power Rangers,"Power Rangers is one of those franchises that hits my nostalgia *just right*

As a sidenote I'd so love another crack at a new movie, or fuck it make an anime."
Mighty Morphin Power Rangers,is no one going to mention that the Green Ranger was in that trailer?!?!? Did Jason film this before his suicide?
Mighty Morphin Power Rangers,"I was excited before, but more so now. The juice bar, the OG Megazord (which looks great), the updated look to the command center...and Alpha 5."
Mighty Morphin Power Rangers,Good to hear Billy came back from Aquitar
Mighty Morphin Power Rangers,"I'm so confused by this project despite my nostalgia wanting pulling me hard to watch it.

1. What happened to the Power Rangers movie that came out a few years ago? I thought it did well? 
2. Aren't there like two rangers who have passed away from this team?
3. Hasn't the entire Power Rangers continuity been reset? Like didn't the universe get purged of evil at one point?"
Mighty Morphin Power Rangers,"I haven't kept up with power rangers since I was a kid in the 90s, but dang Billy looking a bit old while Zack over here looking the exact same as I remember. Guess black (ranger) really don't crack"
Mighty Morphin Power Rangers,Loved the typical piano rendition of the theme at the end. It's like they weren't going to do it but chose to copy every other movie reboot and throw it in.
Mighty Morphin Power Rangers,"Man, no Austin St. John or Amy Jo Johnson as the original red and pink rangers? Dunno how I feel about this tbh."
Mighty Morphin Power Rangers,"I fully expect an Austin st John cameo since he's been in Ranger stuff not too long ago.

Also seeing the two rangers wearing SPA seemed like SPD (one of the best seasons) branding. Space Patrol Alpha?"
Mighty Morphin Power Rangers,Are Bulk and Skull returning? lmao it would be comedy gold if they had a cameo.
Mighty Morphin Power Rangers,"With the return of Brendan Fraser, rumblings of an *Animorphs* movie (though not so recent, to be fair) and now this, it feels like the 90s are slowly coming back in a big way. It certainly makes sense after all the 80s nostalgia of recent years."
Mighty Morphin Power Rangers,"Aww that's so cute. It's exactly how I remembered it as a kid. The suits are the exact same designs, the movements are just as awkward as any Sentai show, and it just feels like all that improved were the colors, resolution, and the quality of the costumes(maybe)."
Mighty Morphin Power Rangers,Hyped.
Mighty Morphin Power Rangers,Hopefully the talent and crew were treated better than back in the 90s.  [Saban was not a great employer.](https://variety.com/1998/biz/news/saban-disputes-sag-accusations-1117467256/)
Mighty Morphin Power Rangers,I thought this was gonna be a documentary. Didn’t realize this was an actual continuation of the story…
Mighty Morphin Power Rangers,"What a shot of nostalgia. 

When I was kid in the early nineties, we didn’t have cable but my great grandmother knew how much a I loved the Power Rangers. That wonderful lady proceeded to record every episode of MMPR that she could for me. I’m surprised I didn’t wear that tape out for how many times I watched it as a kid. It’s near and dear to my heart.

Is there a place I could upload it for everyone to see? It’s fantastic and is an absolute blast from the past with the commercials and everything. Even includes an episode of VR Troopers 😂"
Mighty Morphin Power Rangers,"It seems like the black ranger is the leader based off the trailer, I wonder why they didn’t focus more on Rocky. And I’m really curious who the green ranger is!"
Mighty Morphin Power Rangers,Who else thought the blue ranger was Dennis from Always Sunny
Mighty Morphin Power Rangers,The 90s kid in me is very excited!
Mighty Morphin Power Rangers,"I was a late 90’s kid so I missed this original run but my grandma used to go to car boots and buy me video tapes (vhs) of the show, literally grew up on this original. What a trip to see even some of the original actors there."
Mighty Morphin Power Rangers,Canonizing the death of Thuy Trang is pretty wild. Coupled with losing JDF... this is gonna be a weird watch.
Mighty Morphin Power Rangers,Where are Skull and Bulk?
Mighty Morphin Power Rangers,this hyped me up beside not watching any power ranger stuff since probably the Mighty Morphin movie.
Mighty Morphin Power Rangers,"Wow, so this is how they're gonna tie in the death of Thùy Trang(Trini). Respect and prayer for Thùy Trang!💐"
Mighty Morphin Power Rangers,The sequel us 40 year Olds deserve!
Mighty Morphin Power Rangers,"I was wondering how this was going to work without Thuy Trang. I love it.

But who’s playing the Pink Ranger? And the Green Ranger? They don’t even have anyone listed on IMDb for him but he’s clearly in the trailer. And the Red Ranger?! So the only originals are Billy and Zack?!

I stopped watching the show long before this series ended (and I’ve never watched any of the others) so I don’t know how it ended (apart from Rita I guess. Spoiler alert). The last time I saw Thuy was in “The Crow: City of Angels”. Then I heard she passed. And then Jason David Frank passed recently, so I knew they wouldn’t be in it. But what happened to the others?"
Mighty Morphin Power Rangers,"The effects look kinda amateurish and the action choreography looks... okay

Classic Power Rangers"
Mighty Morphin Power Rangers,"1) Shame the guy that played Tommy missed this.

2) Was the facelift part of Billy’s morphin’?"
Mighty Morphin Power Rangers,"As a life long fan of power rangers, this looks horrible. But I'm still gonna watch it. Same quality as the latest shows. But power rangers is power rangers. Hasn't been good since RPM though IMO."
Mighty Morphin Power Rangers,This was the last thing I expected to make me cry tonight but I couldn't help it after realizing JDF isn't a part of it. These guys were my superheroes in elementary school since I wasn't into comic books.
Mighty Morphin Power Rangers,I hope Jason David Frank filmed something before he passed.
Mighty Morphin Power Rangers,And right when i cancelled netflix. Sheesh. Interesting that they used Rocky for red rangers and Kat for pink. No adam/Aisha/tommy.
Mighty Morphin Power Rangers,Go-Go Power Girdle!
Mighty Morphin Power Rangers,"Dumbest show ever. 

Bring on the downvotes."
Mighty Morphin Power Rangers,[deleted]
Mighty Morphin Power Rangers,Who is this for…. 30 year olds aren’t watching this age writing and the target age group won’t get why it’s old folks….
Mighty Morphin Power Rangers,"I remember Billy, but who are these other people? Also, this looks terrible."
Mighty Morphin Power Rangers,Why did Trini literally fall off the face of the Earth?
Mighty Morphin Power Rangers,Isn't one of them a porn star? 🤔
Mighty Morphin Power Rangers,"I'm glad that they chose to use Zack (Walter Jones) as the *black* ranger, choosing nostalgia over PC. 

For those gen z and younger, who are not familiar, in the first MMPR run, they \*unintentionally\* cast a black person as a black ranger and an asian person as the *yellow* ranger. No one caught on to that at first. Then they realize their oopsie and wrote in a storyline to replace the black black ranger and the asian yellow ranger by an asian black ranger (adam park) and a black yellow ranger (aisha).

And from that point forward, the Power Rangers franchise has not ever casted a black person as a black ranger nor an asian person as a yellow ranger.

Until now..."
Mighty Morphin Power Rangers,"Yay for the badly aged actors getting a paycheck again... That being said: ENOUGH!!! You guys have to accept that stories have AN END! EVERYTHING HAS AN END! Everything dies, even the universe one day too will die, so stop making ""and just like that..."" sequels nobody asked for!!! Has all creativity really ran out? If it's not Social Justice Garbage being pushed is some blatant attempt to get their hands deep in our pockets through some shitty nostalgia based sequel. STOP!"
Mighty Morphin Power Rangers,"I thought that was John C Riley on the right, and got super excited"
Mighty Morphin Power Rangers,I’m 34 and I’m excited to see this
Mighty Morphin Power Rangers,Why does Alpha 5 sound so pissed off?
Mighty Morphin Power Rangers,I can't wait! I can't wait!
Mighty Morphin Power Rangers,I know what I’m watching on 4/20
Mighty Morphin Power Rangers,Oh my god!!!
Mighty Morphin Power Rangers,I love that they kept the same old uncomfortable looking suits that probably pool with sweat.
Mighty Morphin Power Rangers,hopefully they got paid this time and not bullied
Mighty Morphin Power Rangers,It's Morphin Time
Mighty Morphin Power Rangers,Wonder who is playing green ranger as he is in a shot since apparently JDF said no beforehand.
Mighty Morphin Power Rangers,"""Don't worry, we've saved the world before."" Love it an can't wait."
Mighty Morphin Power Rangers,"I don’t know. I guess killing off Trini and bringing a story line about her daughter is a way to honor the original actor’s memory by having the Rangers mourn her loss.

But at the same time it kind feels disrespectful. I guess it will depend on how it’s handled.

This won’t be the first time a Power Ranger dies, but it seems like the first time they’ll stay dead.

Still, I’m a bit surprised they didn’t bring back Aisha. She was also a Mighty Morphing Yellow Ranger. The Sabertooth Tiger Zord is hers. Although I guess it can be explained the same way they explained her retirement from the show. She is still in Africa helping villages."
Mighty Morphin Power Rangers,"I can't click the trailer right now, but it's been 30 or so years since I watched this show and for the life of me I cannot remember if, why, when or how they actually morphed"
Mighty Morphin Power Rangers,"this hit me right in my heart, that nostalgia was *powerful*"
Mighty Morphin Power Rangers,"My entire skin is tingling but I really, really hope there's an actual guitar in this opening at some point."
Mighty Morphin Power Rangers,"Would have loved to see Tommy, sorry Jason, you were going through too much."
Mighty Morphin Power Rangers,"Wow, I never put together Richard Horvitz was Alpha 5. Guy has such a unique recognizable voice. Went back to see if it was a recast and nope! He was the original, incredible."
Mighty Morphin Power Rangers,It *must* be a coincidence that this drops one day before everyone gets stoned out of their gourds…
Mighty Morphin Power Rangers,"As a kid it was always so jarring to me when supervillains in PR and Xmen TAS and the like would dance so cautiously around using the word 'kill'. Lots of ""I will destroy you""s and ""they will be eliminated""s, but never kill no no. Far too vulgar. I mean the bad guys are often literal monsters but theyre not MONSTERS ffs. 


I never noticed how cheesy the acting was, how ludicrous the plotlines were, how watered down the action, but i always noticed when ""kill"" was substituted out for something stupid and roundabout. 


The only exception was Apocalypse in XTAS because when dudes delivering banger substitutions like [""I am the rocks of the eternal shore. Crash against me and be broken.""](https://youtu.be/8bmn6bjlw70), well that's just a straight fuckin upgrade."
Mighty Morphin Power Rangers,Haven’t seen the comics I guess haha
Mighty Morphin Power Rangers,There’s other things tying into this outside of the og series?
Mighty Morphin Power Rangers,Asking the true question.
Mighty Morphin Power Rangers,Can't show the best part of the movie in the trailer.
Mighty Morphin Power Rangers,"The suits can do anything, in ""Turbo"" they turned a kid into a 6 six-foot tall fighter."
Mighty Morphin Power Rangers,"The Ranger suits have always ""morphed"" your body into their peak physical condition. Hence calling it a ""metamorphosis"". Its *always* done that."
Mighty Morphin Power Rangers,They weren't wearing the suits in the original either.
Mighty Morphin Power Rangers,"It makes sense, they had to address why Thuy Trang wasn't in the movie since she died in 2001. This way they don't need to do any bs, she's busy working as the UN Ambassador crap lol.

*Edit* nevermind, I hadn't seen a list of actors and didn't know that it wasn't the original 5 only. I really thought they got all 4 of the remaining actors back."
Mighty Morphin Power Rangers,Yes. The plot been so secretive. I wasn't expecting that. Very nice.
Mighty Morphin Power Rangers,Zordon is dead.
Mighty Morphin Power Rangers,"Zordon did recruit adults in 1969 to become the Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers of that era with a single mission, to stop Psycho Green, who had awakened due to the NASADA moon landing. The Pink, Blue and Black Rangers died, while the Red and Yellow Rangers had their Power Coins taken away. The team was quite conflicted because they all came from different backgrounds: a NASADA secretary, a KGB intelligence officer, a British musician, a college protester and a Vietnam soldier.   


So when Rita Repulsa was finally released, he chose a less confrontational group,  teenagers, who could grow their skills faster than their cooperativeness."
Mighty Morphin Power Rangers,">~~child soldiers~~

Teenagers with attitude"
Mighty Morphin Power Rangers,More to the point glad he's leader. Getting the respect he deserves. Always seems like such a cool guy irl.
Mighty Morphin Power Rangers,I still want a fully serious version of TMNT (like the comics) and Power Rangers.
Mighty Morphin Power Rangers,I thought the last movie they did was really good.
Mighty Morphin Power Rangers,">something like Logan

That would be hilarious actually lol."
Mighty Morphin Power Rangers,"If I recall, he was offered and turned it down (this was prior to his passing)."
Mighty Morphin Power Rangers,That was my first thought
Mighty Morphin Power Rangers,Zack don’t crack
Mighty Morphin Power Rangers,Right?! The only thing about him that looks different to me is I think his hair is a little bit longer. Lol. Man has NOT aged.
Mighty Morphin Power Rangers,He better have gotten with Angela
Mighty Morphin Power Rangers,"I never understood why they've never made it an anime. It's super heroes and mechs in a monster of the week format with an overarching storyline.

It literally fits a 26 piece like a glove"
Mighty Morphin Power Rangers,"The new comics have a run called “shattered grid” which is absolutely *incredible*. It’s the PG-13 story that I’ve always wanted power rangers to tell. If they could adapt that into a trilogy of movies or a new show… we’d have a hit, guaranteed."
Mighty Morphin Power Rangers,After. It's pretty spooky.
Mighty Morphin Power Rangers,"I'm assuming the grassland fight is the opening of the movie, all helmets on the whole time.  Trini ""die,"" we cut to black, flash forward."
Mighty Morphin Power Rangers,"I'm wagering Jason, Kimberly and Tommy's actors most likely provided a voiceline or two ahead of pre-production for them to use as a courtesy. They most likely won't remove their helmets.

Chances are the later shots of the Green Ranger in the rematch fight might be another former Ranger suiting up on Tommy's behalf. The ongoing theory is Adam may be the one to do so but it might not be."
Mighty Morphin Power Rangers,"No.  In a Facebook stream early last year, he said he felt he had done enough for the franchise and was done."
Mighty Morphin Power Rangers,Stunt double just for the opening.
Mighty Morphin Power Rangers,"Speaking of the OG megazord… I wonder how they’re going to explain that. 

When the thunderzords were destroyed (in horrific fashion to a young version of me), that was the end of the OG zords. 

Probably some time travel shenanigans I’d assume"
The Spectacular Spider-Man,[deleted]
The Spectacular Spider-Man,Dope it's a great adaptation it's a shame it was cut short
The Spectacular Spider-Man,"I like it because I just want the Amazing Spider-Man comic recreated in exacting detail, except animated and with sound. This is the closest we’ve ever made it. Still shot straight towards Venom way too goddamn fast, but starting with Gwen instead of jumping right to Mary Jane was nice.  And we got some Captain Stacy being spidey’s confidant and helping him out, which is a bit of the comic that always seemed to get left out."
The Spectacular Spider-Man,Why is it on Netflix instead of Disney plus?
The Spectacular Spider-Man,Hasn't it been on Netflix for a while now
The Spectacular Spider-Man,"I personally think Spider-Man the animated series is the greatest Spider-Man cartoon, but Spectacular Spider-Man is a close second"
The Spectacular Spider-Man,Best Spider-Man cartoon for sure. Ended up buying it last year on Amazon but I'm glad it's on a service now
The Spectacular Spider-Man,Its intro is a fucking banger.
The Spectacular Spider-Man,Is 2003 TAS on Disney plus?
The Spectacular Spider-Man,"It's been on international netflix for years, and I wish people would watch it since it's by far the best spiderman cartoon (and I say this as someone who grew up with the 90s one)

Greg Weisman is the creator and he's behind Gargoyles, this and Young Justice. And it's a shame that more people don't watch his shows when they're all amazing. Spectacular Spiderman was in this weird limbo when Disney bought Marvel and it was ultimately canceled. 

Hope more people see one of the best spiderman media ever"
The Spectacular Spider-Man,"Anyone else notice the ""New Episodes"" bar when you go to select Spectacular Spider-Man?"
The Spectacular Spider-Man,Really not sure that I like that style of animation.
The Spectacular Spider-Man,The Amazing Spider Man is 1000% better then this.
The Spectacular Spider-Man,Is it as entertaining as the Harley Quinn cartoon series?
The Spectacular Spider-Man,Does anyone have an essential episode list for this? I think this might actually be the first time I've heard about this.
The Spectacular Spider-Man,Ayy LFG! Amazing show
The Spectacular Spider-Man,Just finished rewatching it. As great as I remember
The Spectacular Spider-Man,*Sad Italian noises*
The Spectacular Spider-Man,That could actually work with how well Invincible did.
The Spectacular Spider-Man,"It got cancelled right when YouTube and Netflix hit it big in 2009 and the primary reason it got cancelled is because the rights were purchased back by Marvel in a collab. And Ultimate Spider-Man came out to replace it which was very meh.

Even with nostalgia for the 90s series I still highly recommend this show. The animation is stellar, storylines are very good, they have a ton of homages to all Spider-Man versions from Ultimate to Raimi, they love setting things up and have wonderful surprises, and they fleshed out much of Pete's high school class and felt most in tone with Stan's and Ditko's original tone.

Get enough views and Greg Weismann (Gargoyles and Young Justice) to finish the planned 3 more seasons with the Scorpion, Sin Eater, Hydro Man and Hobgoblin (all set up).

Can't fish about it enough. Had it gone for its full intended run it might have rivalled B:TAS."
The Spectacular Spider-Man,"Would need to get Greg Weisman back and he's been working on Young Justice since that got revived. Although seems like with the Discover takeover, that may get chopped."
The Spectacular Spider-Man,I'd be down with an hour-long Spider-Man cartoon
The Spectacular Spider-Man,It was on Crackle in the US until Sony sold Crackle to Chicken Soup for the Soul Entertainment a few years back.
The Spectacular Spider-Man,">This is actually a pretty big thing; I don't know if it's ever been on any streaming service before. 

I'm not American but I rewatched the show on Netflix like a year ago."
The Spectacular Spider-Man,"Very true. Which is kinda why it’s important people start watching it because if it actually does well (Which it is so far. #4 on Netflix’s kid shows after only about 4 days), Sony would consider bringing it back in a 45 minute format"
The Spectacular Spider-Man,"I thought Disney still owned all the tv rights for Spider-Man, Sony only has movies."
The Spectacular Spider-Man,I remember watching it on Amazon Prime like 7 or 8 years ago when I was young although I live in Northern Ireland (in the UK) so it may not have been on in the States. Also it was added to Netflix UK and Ireland months ago which I do no is different to the States.
The Spectacular Spider-Man,"It was on Netflix and Crackle before, although it’s been awhile since it was on either one. 

I remember watching a few episodes on crackle a couple years ago and then found out it was removed when I went to continue.

The only reason I know it used to be on Netflix is because when I discovered it was on there again yesterday, it said the show was already in my list."
The Spectacular Spider-Man,True but it also gave us the enforcers.
The Spectacular Spider-Man,Why would it be? Disney doesn't own any rights to Spiderman.  Not sure who owns the rights to Spectacular Spiderman.
The Spectacular Spider-Man,"In the UK it definitely has, I binged it on Netflix about 2 months ago."
The Spectacular Spider-Man,Yes but this is the first time it's in the US so there you go...
The Spectacular Spider-Man,"Same, but I might be biased because I grew up with TAS."
The Spectacular Spider-Man,"Totally agree. I actually recently rewatched the Spider-Man TAS on D+ and found it held up really well even to this day. The fact that they told highly serialized stories back then is really impressive.

By contrast, I really was not that impressed by the 90s X-Men series. Have nostalgia for it but don't think it holds up nearly as well."
The Spectacular Spider-Man,This is a fact and OP is just ignorant to it
The Spectacular Spider-Man,"That's the one where spiderman couldn't punch people and had the worst ending where Mary Jane ended up being hydroman. 

Everyone knows the best spiderman adaptation was the 13 episode new animated series they aired on MTV before its tragic cancelation"
The Spectacular Spider-Man,Yes.
The Spectacular Spider-Man,"Yes. I found that odd. 

Also, there are no English subtitles, just Brazilian and Portuguese."
The Spectacular Spider-Man,It grows on you. The fast-paced fight scenes more than make up for the animation style of the characters.
The Spectacular Spider-Man,"The art style is a turn off for some people, but go with it, and you will be hooked."
The Spectacular Spider-Man,The simple character designs allowed the animators to go hog wild in the action choreography department. It’s as frenetic as a Spidey adaptation should be. Our boy Spidey MOVES.
The Spectacular Spider-Man,I mean I enjoy it way more but they are really nothing alike
The Spectacular Spider-Man,"Just start from the 1st episode. It's only 26 episodes, 13 per season."
The Spectacular Spider-Man,Just watch it. 26 episodes and get it done in a day or two.
The Spectacular Spider-Man,Has there been any news about a season 5?
The Spectacular Spider-Man,">#4 on Netflix’s kid shows after only about 4 days

Damn, that's a REALLY good one IMO."
The Spectacular Spider-Man,[deleted]
The Spectacular Spider-Man,"And that led to the best version of Shocker EVER. Jeff Glenn Bennett is a treasure, ESPECIALLY with that fantastic accent."
The Spectacular Spider-Man,[deleted]
The Spectacular Spider-Man,You do realize that the last three animated Spider-Man shows have been produced by Disney and aired on Disney channels right? And that there is an animated prequel to the MCU Spider-Man coming out on Disney+?
The Spectacular Spider-Man,"Honestly, the writing is just superior. People look at Spectacular Spider-Man with rose-tinted glasses because the cartoon that came after it was so bad"
The Spectacular Spider-Man,The 90’s X-Men series is really bad and rushed when compared to the 90’s Batman series and 90’s Spider-Man series
The Spectacular Spider-Man,"The animation was ahead of its time too, we wouldn't have graphics like that until the PS3 five years later"
The Spectacular Spider-Man,"I don't want to jump to conclusions from pure excitement but.. you don't think they'd bring it back with another season, would they? Could they?"
The Spectacular Spider-Man,"That’s the thing if I’m going to watch an animated comic book series I want it to be for adults: so funny and lots of swearing.

Edit: Downvotes don’t really make sense for a personal preference."
The Spectacular Spider-Man,"No - Weisman did say no one has talked to him about going to any conventions this year and said ""draw your own conclusions."" Given how much shittier programming decisions have been on HBO Max since Discover took over, I'm not too optimistic. Will be a nice surprise if it does get S5."
The Spectacular Spider-Man,Ah ok.
The Spectacular Spider-Man,Them getting those rights back is actually what led directly to the downfall of the show.
The Spectacular Spider-Man,"Nah, SSM was great too IMO. Just about everything Greg Weisman has done in his career has been terrific and SSM is no exception. IMO Spider-Man TAS is better overall but that is at least partially due to Spider-Man TAS getting a complete, five-season run with a satisfying ending."
The Spectacular Spider-Man,"There are parts of it I liked but some of the writing is so lazy. Like one of the first episodes features Wolverine deciding to go to the Arctic to get away from his life. Somehow Sabretooth is just there too - in the Arctic! And they don't even show Sabretooth following him there or anything, Sabretooth just happens to also be there.

It's why I was a bit underwhelmed that D+ chose to revive that show. Because I agree with you, it's the worst of the big animated shows from the 90s."
The Spectacular Spider-Man,How does that make it adult?
The Spectacular Spider-Man,"Damn, dude. It’s a Spider-Man cartoon, probably the best. Why ask for swearing and violence, especially for a show from 2008?"
The Spectacular Spider-Man,It’s not aimed at adults it’s a children cartoon. However it’s one of the best children cartoon I have ever seen
The Spectacular Spider-Man,"I don’t understand why Disney doesn’t just revive Wolverine and the X-Men or even Avengers Earth Mightiest Heroes. Nobody is going to want to watch 90’s animation, in 2021"
The Spectacular Spider-Man,So then it better be as good as *Bluey* then :)
The Spectacular Spider-Man,"Do you mean Wolverine and the X-Men? X-Men TAS is being revived.

I'm sure there are rights issues with Wolverine and the X-Men. But I do agree that they'd be better off reviving something more recent or even just creating something brand new."
The Spectacular Spider-Man,There are no rights issues since Disney bought Fox
The Spectacular Spider-Man,"I hate shows that are cancelled for corporate reasons (tv rights going to Disney). I also hate the Disney have put out 2 terrible Spider-Man cartoons and their future plans are even more childish shows. Spider-Man is like the most popular character ever Disney, put a teen Spider-Man cartoon on D+ ffs"
The Spectacular Spider-Man,"Surprised people on here saying they prefer the 90s series, pretty much everyone I’ve seen talking about Spidey says Spectacular is the best Spider-Man animated show by far and one of the best adaptions of the character period, if not the best full stop."
The Spectacular Spider-Man,"Marvel has a habit of cancelling good animated series and replacing them with subpar shows. 

Case in point, The Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes. That show was amazing and if their second season proved anything, they had enough stories to easily carry them over for a few more seasons."
The Spectacular Spider-Man,"Greg Weisman is fantastic! If you liked Spectacular Spider-Man, also check out the first two seasons of Gargoyles (on Disney+) and the ongoing series Young Justice (on DC Universe and maybe HBO Max)."
The Spectacular Spider-Man,Spectacular Spider-Man was part of that small patch of Marvel animation where they were all top notch out cut off before reaching their prime. Wolverine and the X-Men and Avengers Earth's Mightiest Heroes were both cancelled and I'm still mad about it today. Especially considering the subpar replacements we got for Spider-Man and Avengers
The Spectacular Spider-Man,It could have been great!  I rewatch it all the time and it is undoubtedly the best animated spider-man adaptation there is. The fact that it was replaced with Ultimate Spider-man is nothing short of shameful.
The Spectacular Spider-Man,Watch Spiderman the Animated Series 1994-1998
The Spectacular Spider-Man,Anyone know why it’s don’t on Disney plus I could have swore it was and doesn’t make sense why it’s not
The Spectacular Spider-Man,"Lol,90's Spider-Man is still king. ""Into the spider verse"" movie is also an impressive adaptation."
The Spectacular Spider-Man,"Nah you gotta watch the 90’s one, that was the best"
The Spectacular Spider-Man,God Yes!!!!! And the Spiderman series we got afterwards just felt like such a cop out playing way too safe. I haven’t watched much of the current Spiderman series now but from what I’ve heard it also is suffering from problems
The Spectacular Spider-Man,"Now I need to Rewatxh it again. 
It really is the best interpretation of Spiderman.
It was also a great example that you can change the source material and make it better.
What they did with Eddie Brocks story was a way better than his counterpart in the comics.
By making him a childhood friend of Peter and having his parents be on the same plane as Peter's parents and also them working together as scientist and have his life be affected by Spiderman actions, just make the shift to him becoming a villain soooo much better. 
I love this show so much."
The Spectacular Spider-Man,"OH YEAH! I grew up with the 90s series and thought Spectacular was much better due to being more focused on it's characters and less on the endless jabbering inner monologues. I was mixed on the art style at first, but it grew on me along with the interpretation of the characters. I was kind of sad when they didn't continue."
The Spectacular Spider-Man,Anyone else love the computer animated one with Neil Patrick Harris?
The Spectacular Spider-Man,"I don’t think the recent Spider-Man shows are terrible. They just aren’t as good as Spectacular.  
  
Ultimate Spider-Man had some good moments, but I definitely feel like it was a poor follow up to Spectacular.  
  
The current show though, Marvel’s Spider-Man (because they couldn’t find any other way to make it impossible to find online or distinguish it from any other Spider-Man property) actually isn’t half bad. It tones down a lot of Ultimate Spider-Mans goofiness and does have character development moments similar to the Ultimate Spider-Man comic and Spectacular, but it’s definitely much more on the nose in terms of its writing. The current show grew on me over time. Ultimate was much rougher though :/"
The Spectacular Spider-Man,"In a Perfect world we would have The Writing team of Spectacular Spider-man teamed up with the Animation team Avatar Korra, that was an expensive to make show but goddamn if it wasn't beautiful."
The Spectacular Spider-Man,"Ultimate was great, I remember really liking the final season"
The Spectacular Spider-Man,They're both very good.
The Spectacular Spider-Man,"I've only seen the 90's series so I can't compare it to Spectacular Spidey, but the 90's series *was* pretty awesome.

It felt like the golden era for superhero cartoons with *Spider-Man, X-Men* and *Batman: The Animated Series* all on around the same time."
The Spectacular Spider-Man,"yeah i think people just remember the intro song and for a lot of people it was their first real dive into spider-man. I used to have the same nostalgia for it, but upon rewatching it a few years back...... yikes."
The Spectacular Spider-Man,"I really wish it could be continued.  Such a fantastic show.  My favorite of Greg Weisman, and he’s done a lot of other great shows too"
The Spectacular Spider-Man,"I’ve seen a lot of people say 90s all over the internet. A: they haven’t watched spectacular (some say “it looks kiddie”) or B: their blinded by nostalgia. Imo it doesn’t even come close to as good as spectacular is, and I grew up with the 90s."
The Spectacular Spider-Man,i do plan to watch young justice as well
The Spectacular Spider-Man,"i’m also watching that on disney plus. some of the animation and voice acting is a little clunky, but it’s still very comic accurate and does justice to spidey’s entire supporting cast"
The Spectacular Spider-Man,"spiderblood, spiderblood, radioactive spiderblood, spiderman  
  
That Wonder Woman movie straight up ripped off this amazing spider-theme. That's a terrific series, they get the storytelling right."
The Spectacular Spider-Man,"I rewatch both 1994 Spider-Man and Spectacular Spider-Man quite regularly. Spectacular is honestly all around more solid. But both series excel in their own ways, and are both very good in a lot of the same ways.

I really miss that era of Spider-Man. I feel like the only time in the last 10 years we got anything that had that same feeling was when Spider-Man PS4 came out (although don't get me wrong, I did love Spider-Verse sooo much). But I just feel like it is going to be *yeeeears*, if ever, before we get a good Spider-Man that actually has to keep his identity largely a secret, has to deal with the struggles of working alone, being a normal person outside the costume, and having internal conflicts and crises that we get to peer into.

Spectacular and 90's Spider-Man both capture that amazingly. It seems like everything with Spider-Man now, especially the cartoons, is him along with a bunch of friends or ever-present allies, or him already having access to cutting edge technology, etc etc. He is never any longer just a normal, relatable, struggling guy with a real life who puts on the suit. Even if I like some of the last decade of Spider-Man, they have definitely stripped him of that quality that he had in some his best media, and that's the quality that to me makes him, at least to me, a cut above the majority of other superheroes.

Why am I rambling about this to a seemingly unrelated comment? I just really like Spider-Man."
The Spectacular Spider-Man,That series is just superb! To me its still the ultimate embodiment of Spider-Man. They put so much in there its crazy.
The Spectacular Spider-Man,So basically watch an inferior show. Okay 🙃
The Spectacular Spider-Man,the sony licensing thing
The Spectacular Spider-Man,Just curious... Have you seen Spectacular?
The Spectacular Spider-Man,Nope
The Spectacular Spider-Man,Ive been rewatching it with my daughter. I feel the stories hold up pretty well. Animation and fights can be janky at times but still a good show to watch.
The Spectacular Spider-Man,They own the movie rights all the other shows are on Disney plus
Merlin,"the ultimate cockblock of a show

teased you every season finale that this would be the one that Arthur discovered merlins secret"
Merlin,"In many ways, this felt like the spiritual successor of Xena/Hercules. It was pretty much the 00's version of these shows. I loved that campy piece of trash"
Merlin,Does that mean Arthur's now a disney prince?
Merlin,"I would like to thank Merlin for giving us all Katie McGrath on screen. Suffice it to say, ever since this and her blink-and-you'll-miss-it cameo in the Tudors...I've been a fan."
Merlin,"I used to love this show.  I remember them fucking up the last part of it, sadly."
Merlin,"Ah, yes, for those who haven't been able to get their ""Great series with a horrible ending"" fix since GoT ended."
Merlin,"Weird, since its already on iPlayer for free"
Merlin,Good show worth watching. Just rewatched the show a couple months ago.
Merlin,[deleted]
Merlin,"Never watched this, but shout-out to the TV special premium short series, Merlin, with Sam Neil and Martin Short.  I must have watched that movie 500x as a kid and 12 year old me was definitely feelin Queen Mab"
Merlin,"Breaking news: 14 year old program gets passed off to another streaming service! Why’s this news… Also, as much as I liked the show, the dragon is laughably bad."
Merlin,Does it end? I remember watching a couple of seasons but never saw the conclusion.
Merlin,"Pretty good show, but I was always more into Legend of the Seeker"
Merlin,This is such an amazing piece of work. Watched the journey multiple times. British TV just had all the sauce on this genre of show.
Merlin,￼I’m glad to see Disney+ starting to stretch their style of programs you would expect. Makes me hopeful for content acquisition in the future.￼
Merlin,Merlin Merlin Merlin!
Merlin,"this was our Smallville, so haters can go suck it

&#x200B;

on a sidenote, imagine Merlin remade with HOTD/ROP budget, ohhh myyyyyyy"
Merlin,"The show was a bit disappointing in the end, but I’m hoping this revitalizes the fanfiction supply."
Merlin,This is what you should be watching instead of Game of Thrones or Lord of the Rings.
Merlin,And the fan goes wild.
Merlin,Low key terrible show but not terrible enough to be entertaining in the Xena way.
Merlin,Man Disney+ UK is so good compared to the US with the Fox and local content
Merlin,I detest that show. Merlin was so fucking stupid.
Merlin,Wait what? This was a BBC show back in 2008 and was mediocre back then.
Merlin,"“This was an exciting time for N.B.C. Not Seinfeld, Friends, E.R. exciting. More like 3D episodes of Merlin exciting.”"
Merlin,"loved the way they write author, he's virtuous.

&#x200B;

EDIT: you spell aurther?"
Merlin,Is Merlin available on Disney + (USA)? I’ve wanted to watch it since first learning about it a year ago.
Merlin,John Hurt was great as the dragon. There's also a fun turn from Emilia Fox in it.
Merlin,"Never finished watching it but I remember hating the King, that dumb fuck stick >:("
Merlin,I feel some of the cgi needs remastering.
Merlin,"Even worse the whole premise was about young Merlin and Arthur before Arthur became the king of legends. I think everyone expected at the beginning of the show that it would end during the early time of Arthur's rule on a happy note with a long rule in front of him. 

But instead of it Arthur died after barely having ruled. A 2 years rule doesn't make him a legend. History would have practically forgotten the kind of king Arthur was simply because of his very short rule. 

If they left it all open ended, how Arthur would have ruled Camelot in the future with the help of Merlin while knowing he is a wizard, that would have been one thing. But instead they killed Arthur off a day after he knew Merlin had magic. So what did it all matter in the end? The magic reveal was important for their future relationship, but there was no future relationship with Arthur dead. 

When season 5 started airing it was already announced that it would be the last season and I remember how everyone on fan forums were raging how they were wasting time each episode with waiting with the reveal. And then the reveal came and they killed off Arthur at once. It was all so stupid. I personally was more angry with that ending than the one GOT had."
Merlin,"Wait, he never found out? I've only watched up to season 2 so I don't know what happens."
Merlin,This was basically the UK’s Smallville.
Merlin,"That was what made me quit the show near the end of the series.  This was one of the rare shows that I just stopped watching near the end and never completed it.

It could have been something special but to many things in the show was pissing me off and I dropped it like a bad habit."
Merlin,"It was directly inspired by Smallville and how it was a “superman” show without Superman. No tights, no flights."
Merlin,Merlin was fantastic and I really liked the last scene.
Merlin,Has been since sword in the stone animated.
Merlin,And yet they can make money for other rights so why not
Merlin,This is how I describe it to people! It also totally destroys me emotionally every time I watch it.
Merlin,It has a really crappy ending that no one seemed to enjoy.
Merlin,"Yeah, it had a fifth and final season."
Merlin,"> but I was always more into Legend of the Seeker

I was hoping to never remember that horrible train wreck of a show.

Book describes the main character as large and handsome and able to use his size and charisma to diffuse situations.

Tv show: Lets hire a short scrawny guy, good enough, right?"
Merlin,They likely just need it to meet local content quota laws.
Merlin,Considering it’s for children it’s amazing
Merlin,"I just checked and it is not on Disney plus in the US. It is however, on Netflix though."
Merlin,"Yeah I honestly think the show kind of lost sight of its premise somewhere around the start of season four.

It was never meant to be the whole story of Arthur and Merlin, just their origins."
Merlin,"Dude you nailed it. The ending was atrocious.

I loved Morgana."
Merlin,"It absolutely sucked to watch the final two episodes during Christmas. It was one of my favourite shows as a teenager and the ending has made it impossible to rewatch the entire series. I’ve only been able to rewatch it once up to four seasons. 

I remember reading all the forum discussions and it definitely helped to know that people were upset over the ending as well."
Merlin,he finds out in the very last episode
Merlin,"My memory is it jumps between “he knows but for the sake of his friendship, he doesn’t say” and “he’s literally so stupid, he doesn’t know, even when shit is happening right in front of him”."
Merlin,Watching smallville weekly and waiting for Superman to fucking fly was excruciating. It’s actually better in a rewatch because you don’t care anymore.
Merlin,"every season finale would tease something epic
and then next season everything is back to normal.

and after a certain point every evil character acts so evil even when they are trying to pretend they are not evil"
Merlin,The tone was also heavily inspired by the reboot of Doctor Who in 2005.
Merlin,"Disney King, technically.  He can join Kida and Kuzco in the corner with the rest of Disney's forgotten monarchs."
Merlin,I meant this one with the sassy b1tch merlin.
Merlin,"Also, iPlayer isn't free, it's £13.25 a month."
Merlin,"Oh yeah, I heard about that, UK and France especially in Europe seem to be very adamant about that. ￼￼"
Merlin,"It was a terrible reveal. They waited so long and although it was the main reveal, it did not really matter in the context of the episode. 

The final shot with the prosthetic makeup was absolutely hilarious."
Merlin,merlin was a show that wasted so much of its potential
Merlin,I really hated this show’s ending.
Merlin,Yeah it had so much potential in the beginning.
Merlin,It actually could have been one of the greatest shows ever. Needed full serialisation + to be made for adults.
Merlin,"It's the definition of ""Is that it?"""
Merlin,Well I mean that's kinda what happens when a show gets cancelled.
Merlin,"Holy shit, yes! This is the exact kind of premise I'm always here for."
Merlin,"I actually love the sound of this, could be a lot of fun. Given that it's on NBC I won't expect it to last long but I'll watch it if it gets a series order."
Merlin,">On the TV side, Perfect Storm Entertainment is in production on the third season of crime drama Warrior for HBO Max

Well there's the damn news I was looking for!"
Merlin,">	and Star Trek: Beyond, the *final* film in the modern Star Trek trilogy"
Merlin,More Merlin magic shenanigans taking place in current times pls. Hopefully it is also gothic like Sleepy Hollow.
Merlin,Sorry very much unrelated (mostly) but damn that headline sent me to mid-00s BBC Saturday night tv.
Merlin,I liked his work on Love and monsters so i'm looking forward to it.
Merlin,The version we need of this is story is Bernard Cornwell's.
Merlin,I AM. MERLIN. SELECT GAME.
Merlin,In a land of myth and time of magic...........

Merlin,The warlord chronicles?  Omg yes!!
Merlin,"Per the article;

>While several films have focused on the King Arthur legend, the only high-profile story to focus specifically on the story of Merlin was the NBC miniseries Merlin that starred Sam Neill.

I think not Deadline, I think not."
Merlin,John Hurt as a dragon. RIP.
Merlin,Mark Strong is a great addition to the series.
Merlin,">Strong will play Emperor Javicco Corrino, a man from a great line of war-time Emperors, who is called upon to govern the Imperium and manage a fragile peace.

I will now watch your show."
Merlin,two white Englishmen: we have our villains
Merlin,Mark strong in the dune universe?! I can now die in peace.
Merlin,Mark Strong always does solid work in anything he is in.
Merlin,The cast is awesome. Hopefully the writing is at the same level.
Merlin,"Mark Strong.... Ok ok, I'll watch it but if it's shit I'm fast forwarding all scenes without him."
Merlin,"I know how people feel about these books, but... could we actually get an adaptation that is better than the original material? One can always be positive."
Merlin,Mark Strong? Oh helllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllll yes! And playing an Emperor? I'm getting Lee Pace as the Emperor in 'Foundation' vibes and I love it. Pace was amazing and I expect the same from Strong.
Merlin,Don’t trust HBO max should of been a HBO original
Merlin,[deleted]
Merlin,"Lets finish the movies before we start thinking about the shows.

Oh right, I forgot we're in this time of content creating."
Merlin,It's gonna suck and you all know it.
Merlin,Gosh I feel like there's a great Paul Mooney joke from Chappelle's Show that would fit here
Merlin,Just say no to prequels.
Merlin,This image isn’t really showing off that sisterhood.
Merlin,I’m honestly really looking forward to this show
Merlin,"Damnit, so much for him being cast as Count Fenring in the sequel."
Merlin,It's a prequel to the sequels to the sequels of the prequels.
Merlin,I just signed up for hbomax so I could watch southland and they don’t have it? How can I watch southland?
Merlin,"Mark Strong? Sold!

Mark Strong as the Emperor? SOLD, SOLD, SOLD!"
Magi: The Labyrinth of Magic,"Neeson:

>”No, I’m not,” Neeson said when asked if he’s interested in returning. “There’s so many spinoffs of ‘Star Wars.’ It’s diluting it to me, and it’s taken away the mystery and the magic in a weird way.”

>""It was nice to do that little bit with Ewan, after 25 years, 24 years. I appeared in the last episode. I had 2 lines to say, and it was cool and I loved it. But that's it."""
Magi: The Labyrinth of Magic,Star Wars is being hurt by lack of direction and mediocrity.
Magi: The Labyrinth of Magic,"The only Star Wars spinoff I've liked is Rogue One and Andor. 

Andor was one of those where I couldn't *believe* anyone was able to get the script approved."
Magi: The Labyrinth of Magic,"I just don't understand why they insist only doing stuff from the start of the clone wars to just after the fall of the empire. Give me some Old Republic stuff like Mandalorian wars, the ancient sith lords, or the creation of the jedi order."
Magi: The Labyrinth of Magic,Or maybe it's that the ratio of good to shitty movies/shows is like 1 out of 5 being generous.
Magi: The Labyrinth of Magic,Number of spin-offs isn't the problem. Terrible scripts are.
Magi: The Labyrinth of Magic,Liam Neesons though….
Magi: The Labyrinth of Magic,"Honestly, the last movies were hideous in comparison with the spin offs."
Magi: The Labyrinth of Magic,There's different camps of Star Wars fans. Original trilogy vs original 6 vs disney Star Wars
Magi: The Labyrinth of Magic,"ITT: Lots of misdirected anger.

The guy is right, and there's nothing wrong with him saying so.

Edit: FYI, if you're writing me a five paragraph essay of fan drivel, I'm not going to read it."
Magi: The Labyrinth of Magic,"I can see where he's coming from, but when your spinoffs (Mando, Andor) are considered better than the trilogy that recently came out, you gotta get behind what's still making you bank."
Magi: The Labyrinth of Magic,They are being hurt from shit stories and terrible writers
Magi: The Labyrinth of Magic,"He then closed out the interview by promoting his next film.

#Tooken 8: The Tookening"
Magi: The Labyrinth of Magic,"He's not wrong.

It's why DC Comics tried to streamline things for new readers with The New 52, and then Marvel later tried the same thing with Marvel NOW!; when there's too much of something, people get fatigued trying to keep up with everything.

You could always say ""don't watch everything"" but that's not how the brain works."
Magi: The Labyrinth of Magic,The “mystery” was taken away with “midiclorians “
Magi: The Labyrinth of Magic,"Agreed. And he isn't saying all ""spinoffs"" are bad, which would be unsupportable (see: Andor). An overabundance of varying quality, definitely."
Magi: The Labyrinth of Magic,"I mean I kinda agree 

Mainly if your content isn’t AAA maybe it shouldn’t be made 

Like bad batch is great but some episodes are kinda filler and think obi wan and boba Fett shows don’t need to exist"
Magi: The Labyrinth of Magic,He should know. He was a part of the beginning of the end.
Magi: The Labyrinth of Magic,He's right.
Magi: The Labyrinth of Magic,Andor
Magi: The Labyrinth of Magic,"Andor was ten times better than the last 6 movies.

I think it's the opposite.  The terrible movies are ruining the franchise.

Even bobba fett was better than the last few movies."
Magi: The Labyrinth of Magic,"Wasn't he in the midichlorians Star Wars episode that literally removed the mystery of the force?

And didn't he have that bullshit story line about Anakin?  Ok, just checking."
Magi: The Labyrinth of Magic,I agree with him for the most part. Andor was out of this world.
Magi: The Labyrinth of Magic,"Hes right, but also....

Do another movie where your a grizzled old veteran that has to begrudgingly do one last job or save someone that's in trouble, and in the process you redeem yourself."
Magi: The Labyrinth of Magic,Says the guy who did “Taken” and dozen other  of the same formulaic films of a guy seeking revenge.
Magi: The Labyrinth of Magic,"I hate to break it to him, but the prequels diminished the value of the franchise."
Magi: The Labyrinth of Magic,"Says the guy from: Men in Black International, Daddy’s Home 2, The Huntsman, Ted 2, Taken 1-2-3, Anchorman 2, Wrath of the Titans, The Chronicles of Narnia, The A-Team, Les Mis, Arthur the King, Excalibur, and I’m sure I’m missing a few spinoffs, remakes and sequels. He is well versed in running stories into the ground."
Magi: The Labyrinth of Magic,Says the man in the first spinoff.
Magi: The Labyrinth of Magic,Bro there’s too many Liam Neeson movies if anything. Three of them came out last year alone and I bet they were all basically the same
Magi: The Labyrinth of Magic,"He's right. I used to really enjoy the movies occasionally. Even saw the prequels in theaters. Then they kept coming, one after the other and every dumb mother fucker in the world is out here trying to act like they are the biggest fan in the world. It got so annoying that I can't enjoy any of that shit anymore"
Magi: The Labyrinth of Magic,It’s become the Empire
Magi: The Labyrinth of Magic,I don’t mind the expanded universe of movies so long as they are not shit and lately the complaint is that the movies and spinoffs have been nothing but social justice shit.
Magi: The Labyrinth of Magic,Totally agree
Magi: The Labyrinth of Magic,"Yeah, sorry Liam, but nah. Projects like Rogue One, Mandalorian, Bad Batch, and Andor show that there is plenty of time for great stories in this universe. It's not an issue of to much content, but an issue of flying space Mary Poppins cameos of Princess Leia's reanimated corpse and Jar Jar Bigalow ""Mee-sa Senator now"" being regurgitated into the screen. The issue isn't volume, it's quality."
Magi: The Labyrinth of Magic,"""Being hurt""?  


No, the damage was done a very long time ago. Now its more like kicking the pulverized remains of a long dead horse"
Magi: The Labyrinth of Magic,"people here complaining about diluting star wars, sayin disney is at fault.

meanwhile i was reading these same stories in the 90s, in comic and/or novel form, because the star wars EU existed.

the only difference is now they are turning the stories into live action. hell episode 9, which i greatly dislike, is still very much Dark Empire from the 90s.

Fuck if they dont need to go ahead and make Shadows of the Empire into a live action series.

crime lords vs sith lords. lets go!"
Magi: The Labyrinth of Magic,I happen to agree with Mr Neeson on this...
Magi: The Labyrinth of Magic,Whatever made Andor happen - keep doing that.  Best Star Wars material out there.
Magi: The Labyrinth of Magic,"Stars Wars succumbed to the Marvel-ization effect a while ago. I feel the same way about a new star wars IP as I do a new superhero movie: oh, ok."
Magi: The Labyrinth of Magic,"“Star Wars” always struck me as a story about Anakin Skywalker and how he turned away from good and then was redeemed by the love of his son. 

That story has been told."
Magi: The Labyrinth of Magic,"Well Star Wars fans have proven that they'll watch and like any old crap, so it doesn't really matter."
Magi: The Labyrinth of Magic,I agree and also like the some of the spin offs.
Magi: The Labyrinth of Magic,Space Jesus isn't wrong
Magi: The Labyrinth of Magic,"Think the sequel trilogy did that, mate."
Magi: The Labyrinth of Magic,When does Taken 6 come out?
Magi: The Labyrinth of Magic,I think it’s diluting for me that Neeson has made multiple films with the same plot for the last 15 years.
Magi: The Labyrinth of Magic,Clearly not a fan of Andor being better than his entire role.
Magi: The Labyrinth of Magic,"No, it's been hurt by Disney having ZERO outline for the Sequel Trilogy.  Rian Johnson's Episode 8 was a mess, then Episode 9 was an abomination.  ""Somehow, Palpatine returned.""  

Say what you will about Geroge Lucas' writing skills, but ""Somehow, Palpatine returned.""  Is just about the most idiotic sentence in any Star Wars movie... scratch that, ANY movie where a villain came back for unexplained reasons."
Magi: The Labyrinth of Magic,"I disagree, I think fleshing out the galaxy beyond the skywalker saga is a good thing.

I think people are conflating some of the quality issues of some of the content with the need for said content. I would prefer Disney spend more time curating quality Star Wars spin-offs rather than green lighting every half assed project, but I don’t think spin-offs themselves are the issue."
Magi: The Labyrinth of Magic,Isn’t this the guy that shared screen time with JarJar Binks?
Magi: The Labyrinth of Magic,"Respectfully, I disagree."
Magi: The Labyrinth of Magic,Boooo … explore the Galaxy.
Magi: The Labyrinth of Magic,"Yeah, well, you know, that's just, like, your opinion, man.

I think its fine, its more the varying quality that is the problem, not the quantity."
Magi: The Labyrinth of Magic,"I have to disagree with him - especially when it comes to the shows.  For this IP or any other, it really comes down to the quality of what is being produced, not the number.  If it is good, then people will watch it.  For ***Star Wars*** specifically, the ""universe"" is so large I am enjoying the more micro looks into it."
Magi: The Labyrinth of Magic,"Ehh sounds like an old man complaining bout kids on the lawn, I wanna see every story of that universe and now I can. Sure some are misses but at least they tried."
Magi: The Labyrinth of Magic,Jar Jar.
Magi: The Labyrinth of Magic,"I don't know, many people are actually liking some of the things they have done. Many spinoffs in the movie department were really good, like rogue one and solo, many were great successes like the mandalorian and andor. Fans love those (maybe some not so much at the start like it happened with the episodes one though three) but the misses on Disney plus have been much less, the bigger ones were in the last trilogy.

The only thing that really was going to hurt the brand was focusing entirely on the Skywalkers. Fans loved and live through the extended universe for years until they had some live action stuff again. And that was the beauty of Starwars how they could make different stories in the same universe not make everything about the same people all the time."
Magi: The Labyrinth of Magic,It is funny because the spinoffs are the only thing that I enjoy.
Magi: The Labyrinth of Magic,Yeah it started around 2001...
Magi: The Labyrinth of Magic,"You were in one of those spinoffs, Liam! XD"
Magi: The Labyrinth of Magic,"Yep star wars stopped being special a long time ago but there was money to be made so can't really blame disney for squeezing every penny out of it. If you could of told 12 year old me there would be multiple star wars tv shows and movies I would never be even quasi interested in, I don't think I would of believed you, but here we are."
Magi: The Labyrinth of Magic,I mean...the movie he was in started that.
Magi: The Labyrinth of Magic,"Hard to agree when Andor is hands down the best piece of starwars content out there.

I know people who don't watch any starwars content that loved Andor."
Magi: The Labyrinth of Magic,"Yes, but I knew Disney was going to get that 4 billion they paid George Lucas for the franchise back and then some.

There was a video of a guy or someone freaking out when Star Wars Episode 49 or some such came out. I figured that was where it was going to go."
Magi: The Labyrinth of Magic,Pretty sure midiclorines s/p are the ones that took the mystery away.
Magi: The Labyrinth of Magic,I love Qui-Gon!
Magi: The Labyrinth of Magic,"Lol. jar jar binks. There are only 3 star wars films, anything else ruins it."
Magi: The Labyrinth of Magic,Wrong
Magi: The Labyrinth of Magic,Wrong.
Magi: The Labyrinth of Magic,"After reading the comments, I just wanted to say I enjoy the prequels; especially ROTS!"
Magi: The Labyrinth of Magic,Honestly… Rogue One is the only Star Wars movie I like and would watch again.
Magi: The Labyrinth of Magic,Oh please bring back the midiclorian bs…
Magi: The Labyrinth of Magic,Humbly disagree.
Magi: The Labyrinth of Magic,"I love Liam, but Star Wars shat that bed the first movie he was in. At first i was annoyed at them ruining my childhood. Then I realized I'm a grown ass man. Maybe it's ok that Star Wars don't cater to me as a grown ass man the way they did when I was a kid."
Magi: The Labyrinth of Magic,Yep.  This cow has been milked dry
Magi: The Labyrinth of Magic,"From the man, in the movie that gave us a boring genetic reason for jedi to exist."
Magi: The Labyrinth of Magic,"No, because there was no more story to tell after the first trilogy."
Magi: The Labyrinth of Magic,The damage was done with the prequels.
Magi: The Labyrinth of Magic,"Yeah, fuck that. Andor was great. Rogue One was great. Keep them coming."
Magi: The Labyrinth of Magic,No one tell him about where midichlorians came from
Magi: The Labyrinth of Magic,"I feel like the original appeal was a rag tag group of filmmakers and actors got together to tell a story about a rag tag group of underdogs adventuring around space, with lots of space battles and laser swords. But it's grown so beyond that now that it's so exceptionally mainstream. That's probably why The Mandalorian and The Clone Wars are so popular among fans because they are the closest to capturing that spirit."
Magi: The Labyrinth of Magic,"I love The Mandalorian and the original trilogy. I haven't seen Clone Wars or Andor yet. Otherwise, I think the franchise has been more misses than hits."
Magi: The Labyrinth of Magic,"I think he has a point. Lot of garbage in the star wars universe. But there's some true gems. Andor is truly remarkable and if you love star wars, then this series acts as a love letter without unnecessary fan service. It's fantastic story telling within the star wars universe with compelling and interesting characters."
Magi: The Labyrinth of Magic,That’s because he didn’t get a part in a good show. Like Andor…
Magi: The Labyrinth of Magic,I swear I read this as Leslie Nielsen.
Magi: The Labyrinth of Magic,“We have to explain the reason behind Han Solo’s last name.”
Magi: The Labyrinth of Magic,"…He says from the set of Taken 13. /s 

But for real, they should’ve stopped after the prequels, at least there was a point to those ones."
Magi: The Labyrinth of Magic,Isn't this one of the main criticisms leveled against the prequels when they came out? George Lucas has the same problem I do where he has too much anxiety when it comes to explaining things and so he over explains instead of letting the audience infer things. A big reason the first 3 movies were good was because of his ex-wife who edited them.
Magi: The Labyrinth of Magic,-said a person who's never read a star wars book
Magi: The Labyrinth of Magic,No its being hurt by idiots making the decisions and poor writing
Magi: The Labyrinth of Magic,"If only Qui Gon had a young daughter that had been kidnapped whilst on holiday in Coruscant with her best friend, and then he had to use his talents to track her and bring justice to the evil ringleader of the trafficking gang. That would have worked as a spinoff series!!!"
Magi: The Labyrinth of Magic,You mean bad star wars. Andor is a masterclass in how NOT to fuck up the universe. I say more spinoffs
Magi: The Labyrinth of Magic,"True, I literally did not even care about the spin-offs only the main trilogy movies."
Magi: The Labyrinth of Magic,"I totally disagree with Neeson here. If they made fewer Star Wars spinoffs they wouldn't suddenly be more magical. Instead of regular soulless cash crabs it would just be somewhat rare soulless cash crabs.

Hack writers and creatively bankrupt people don't magically become more talented by doing less work."
Magi: The Labyrinth of Magic,"That's a very reductive take on what is a grand fictional universe ripe to tell many different kinds of stories in.

Lack of mystery and magic doesn't happen because of spin-offs, it happens because of unimaginative writers.

But there is a bit of truth to it, of course. You can't keep telling stories without chipping away at the mysteries of the IP. That's just how it goes.

However, I have never believed that to mean that more stories shouldn't be told."
Magi: The Labyrinth of Magic,I've got the perfect solution: don't watch the spinoffs.
Magi: The Labyrinth of Magic,He’s right and he should say it.
Magi: The Labyrinth of Magic,"Well, I don't know. Maybe he has a point, but for me the reason it has been hurt has more to do with the lack of talent and vision, particularly in the sequel trilogy."
Magi: The Labyrinth of Magic,10000% agreed
Magi: The Labyrinth of Magic,Solo is the best Star Wars movie and I'll die on that hill.
Little Princess,"Sigh, I dont have enough room on my DVR"
Little Princess,I'm trying to fill in my blanks on the AFI 100 and for Best Picture nominated movies. Anything on here other than the obvious stuff (Dr. Strangelove/2001/North By Northwest/Singing in the Rain for example)?
Little Princess,Will they ever show Angels with Dirty Faces on TCM again!? 
Little Princess,"I mean yes. Most of the shows you listed are pretty average to bad and I don’t see any of the excellent TV listed from this past year:

Succession

The White Lotus

Black Bird

The Old Man

Slow Horses

Severance 

Bad Sisters

Five Days at Memorial

The Offer

Try those out, you won’t be disappointed."
Little Princess,I'm rewatching The Deuce in the absence of anything good that's new.
Little Princess,"This is or... *was* suppose to be the update for my [winter-spring compilation post](https://www.reddit.com/r/television/comments/voazid/the_best_and_worst_tv_shows_of_2022_so_far_winter/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3).   
  
I think I'm gonna go back to making single posts for each review, because I've realized writing a review right after I watch a show might've given me motivation to watch a lot of these shows in the first place.  
  
Anyways, recommendations are welcome as to what 2022 show I should watch and review next, cuz I don't even know what the fuck is happening anymore (*don't be obvious tho lol*)."
Little Princess,I've already lost it years ago. [In the late 00s](https://i.imgur.com/yv9nc8Q.png) used to watch close to 30 series a week [now I barely watch 2-3.](https://i.imgur.com/rb3Ab80.png)
Little Princess,"Recently watched Slow Horses and Severance, both slapped."
Little Princess,goddamn. how's the new season of Archer tho?
Little Princess,Still decent. Not as good as the early seasons though.
Little Princess,"So, I guess their goal today was to take everyone who said D+ had no original content besides The Mandalorian, and pretty much punch them in the face repeatedly."
Little Princess,Hooch is crazy
Little Princess,"Every official announcement/trailer.

Little Princess,I thought this was wallstreebets DD for a second lol
Little Princess,"Nothing on any of the ""old"" Netflix series has me sad...  Nice write up, though."
Little Princess,/u/arashtp you missed Percy Jackson.
Little Princess,Super stoked on most of this. I’m especially looking forward to the Nat geo content. Can you imagine if Disney+ dropped with half of these titles? Game changer
Little Princess,"Based on the release timelines of those shows, it looks like their strategy is: 

Zeitgeist show for 6 weeks -> 1 week of cool down —> couple weeks of hype up -> next Zeitgeist show -> Repeat"
Little Princess,They're really going all out with the High Republic.
Little Princess,did She Hulk get a trailer or anything?
Little Princess,that's a lot of content
Little Princess,"So strange to realize Ice Age is owned by Disney now. 

Also I’m sort of unexpectedly excited about the continuation of Mighty Ducks!"
Little Princess,A Turner and Hooch reboot yyyeeeeessss!!! I've been a fan (we call ourselves Hoochers) for years and am flipping out right now!!!!
Little Princess,Missing rogue squadron on Star Wars
Little Princess,Hocus Pocus 2. What.
Little Princess,"A lot of this is awesome, but can I just take a moment to appreciate *Sister Act 3*?"
Little Princess,">Tiana is the first princess to have her own Walt Disney Animation Studios series

Just going to ignore the Little Mermaid and Tangled series apparently."
Little Princess,[deleted]
Little Princess,I have only read a hand full of moon knight comics but from what I have heard and read making a PG moon knight show is not going to go over well with fans.
Little Princess,Any specific dates to go with this?
Little Princess,You forgot the multiple tongue in cheek references to Matt Murdock.  Charlie Cox's Daredevil is officially part of the MCU now.  Hes apparently in She Hulk and Spider-Man 3.
Little Princess,"Damn, the Ducks end up becoming what they rebelled against..."
Little Princess,"As a bi dude I'm still waiting for literally anything big that features a non-straight dude. In film they ignored it almost completely out of fear of gay-hating countries banning it and them losing money (like China). 

Really hoping for something to come through, maybe with x-men back in the fold Iceman could get something"
Little Princess,So is Ahsoka taking the place of the Rebels spinoff? Because thats what I was most excited for
Little Princess,Disney is milking Star Wars and Marvel for everything dollar they can squeeze. There are way too many reboots and remakes. They need originally sourced content that has no reliance on existing IP. How about some original NON-Marvel/Star Wars scripted content? I think the Mandalorian is a cute show but I want to see ORIGINAL content for once. This slate of shows are not enough to keep all of their subscribers satisfied.
Little Princess,I just want to have the spin off Thrawn and Ezra travels in space show.
Little Princess,"Hey, bozo, why didn't you mention It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia?

Great list, otherwise."
Little Princess,so much content that post alone made me vomit .
Little Princess,Seems like Star Wars's future is on TV.
Little Princess,Is it weird that I'm most excited for the Josh Peck version of Turner and Hooch?
Little Princess,"Looks like they're updating Microcosmos with A Real Bug's Life, that should be cool as fuck."
Little Princess,">The Mighty Ducks: Game Changers

>Lauren Graham (Gilmore Girls, Parenthood) and Emilio Estevez (reprising his role from the original feature films) star in the next chapter of the hit Mighty Ducks franchise, premiering in early 2021. In present day Minnesota, the Mighty Ducks have evolved from scrappy underdogs to an ultra-competitive, powerhouse youth hockey team. After 12-year-old Evan is unceremoniously cut from the Ducks, he and his mom Alex set out to build their own ragtag team of misfits to challenge the cutthroat, win-at-all-costs culture of competitive youth sports.

I hope Disney has been paying attn to Cobra Kai and takes all the good from it and applies it to the Ducks!!!"
Little Princess,"Man, Tony Stark cannot keep control of his tech, can he? Well, I guess he's dead, so that makes sense."
Little Princess,The one thing I want from Marvel is an OG Nick Fury and the Howling Commandos show.
Little Princess,They forgot Shadow Hunters.
Little Princess,Disney+ launch was more like beta test to ensure their decision of allocating such resources to the platform
Little Princess,"The criticism was regarding lack of original screenplays, too. It's still true in that aspect."
Little Princess,"It's still lacks diversity, it's still marvel, star wars and Pixar animated pg-13 movies, still no new new IPs."
Little Princess,[deleted]
Little Princess,"If they don't have Phill Lewis playing the dog using mocap, they dun goofed."
Little Princess,*holds up lighter*
Little Princess,Thanks man you're awesome
Little Princess,[Rogue squadron](https://youtu.be/5bLkTjn6Y_s)
Little Princess,Not enough 🚀🚀🚀
Little Princess,"Just hints at Daredevil, from Sony in Spider-Man 3 and at the reveal here today for She-Hulk."
Little Princess,"Yeah sounds like the Multiverse in SM3 will pull in Daredevil and Kingpin. Which could be great.

Daredevil was hinted at strongly for SheHulk, and there have been rumors that DNofrio has campaigned hard and they’ve taken him seriously as maybe using his character to put together the Sinister Six."
Little Princess,"There's a big hint in Hawkeye. Maya Lopez is a definitively Daredevil character (Echo, a deaf woman who can see something once and imitate it originally hired by Kingpin to take out Daredevil and eventually befriending him). She also wore the Ronin outfit for awhile that Hawkeye wore in Endgame after his family vanished (New Avengers comics).

Edit: why am I being downvoted for this?"
Little Princess,And Swiss Family Robinson.
Little Princess,It’s pretty genius
Little Princess,Super into the Acolyte as I’d really like to see what the Sith/dark side users were up to during this time period
Little Princess,"No, but they confirmed Tatiana Maslany."
Little Princess,Tim Roth will be back as Abomination and Mark Ruffalo.
Little Princess,Its a rather deceptive line if your not in the know.  WDAS is the movie studio. Disney Television Animation is the studio that typically handles the TV side (they were the ones that made the Tangled series).
Little Princess,That's not necessarily a bad thing tbh. It's how they execute it that matters. GOTG was kinda considered a bottom of the barrel IP for marvel before they made it and it turned out well.
Little Princess,"There’s like 70 announced shows here and less than 10 are actual original ideas. Really disappointing *in my opinion*.

I get people like Star Wars and stuff, but it seems extreme to me."
Little Princess,"I think it could be done. For me at least the fun part is the mind-bendy unreliable narrator stuff and not the graphic violence. Although there is something to be said for when other characters meet Moon Knight and are like, ""oh this guy is *crazy* crazy and not just *Batman* crazy."""
Little Princess,"This didn’t mention any of the Marvel movies since it’s still not certain whether they’ll be released in theaters first or on Disney+ at the same time, but The Eternals is set to have their first openly gay main character whenever that’s released.

If you haven’t watched the Disney+ short film Out, you absolutely should."
Little Princess,"Young Avengers is just over the horizon, and that comes with the most prominent gay couple in marvel. Still a few years out though."
Little Princess,Not sure if it is 100% confirmed but I remember seeing somewhere that Valkyrie is looking for a wife in the next Thor movie.
Little Princess,"As a fellow homo, I'm sorry you're getting downvoted, but that's r/television for you. I've learned not to bring up representation issues on this sub anymore."
Little Princess,"I would bet it will be in a team, or they will reveal the character is gay in a sequel...that way people in China will already be invested.  Because you’re right....they want that China money badly. 


Wouldn’t it be a kick in the nuts to China if the wait until like Shang Chi 3 and reveal he was gay the whole time! Lmao. That could literally start a war!!"
Little Princess,"I feel like this'll be a big part of the Ashoka show, considering that she was still searching when we see her in The Mandolorian."
Little Princess,Thats not on Disney+ you 1 star fool.
Little Princess,That’s pathetic
Little Princess,I really don't like the sound of this. The whole point of the Ducks is that they are scrappy underdogs. Having them become what they played against feels kind of weird. And it's obviously gonna end with both Ducks teams playing against each other. It just sounds weird to me.
Little Princess,"They're going all in because they've lost all profits from Disney parks and tourism, 75% of their revenue.

Also why they gutted ESPN"
Little Princess,"Certainly, but was anyone really expecting that? Aside from Pixar, Disney hasn't done an original story in... I'm not sure. Possibly ever."
Little Princess,Pixar films are all new IPs lol
Little Princess,[deleted]
Little Princess,One Star Wars IP will drive more total interest than anything on HBO Max lmao
Little Princess,"Uh ""Win or Lose"" is a new IP."
Little Princess,"You are soo right. Marvel has been overdone, it's a stale medium at this point.  SW feels the same after the last 3 movies. Even Mando is aimless with no real main plotline.

It's so formulaic it isn't appealing.

Will smith movie,
Cars tv show, 
SW, SW, SW, SW, SW
Marvel movies or shows of all side movie characters, because why not saturate the market with bland superheros"
Little Princess,"Yeah. Did anyone really expect Disney to do something genuinely new? Aside from Pixar, which still has very niche content, I can't remember the last time Disney did an actually new story. 

It's one of the reasons this obsession people on here have with D+ ""killing"" Netflix is so silly."
Little Princess,Well original content in this context means content that is developed specificity for the platform and is owned by Disney
Little Princess,"
>Daredevil was hinted at strongly for SheHulk...

That doesn't excite me...  I don't see Daredevil remaining dark and gritty if placed in She-Hulk.  SH over the years has been more of a fun loving character."
Little Princess,"It's going to be interesting to see how Tim Roth plays his take on Mark Ruffalo.

Little Princess,[deleted]
Little Princess,"It's a Disney property.

They a announced it today, as well.

It actually appears on traditional broadcast television, anyone who can't see this **IS A SAVAGE AND AN IDIOT**.

Stoked about almost all of these, though."
Little Princess,Most of these projects are planned before the COVID
Little Princess,Different services provide different content. I dont see why that's only an issue when it's Disney. How much Oscar winning animated content do we see on HBO or Netflix?
Little Princess,Duh.  If you want Disney's adult content you mosey over to Hulu.  If you've been looking at the end of the year critics' lists you'll have noticed Disney is beating Netflix and Warnerbrothers decisively when it comes to critical acclaim.
Little Princess,Disney doesn’t give a fuck about that. They care about commercial success of which they aren’t matched.
Little Princess,The show is listed as a comedy. Not sure how Charlie's Matt Murdock would fit into that.
Little Princess,"I get it. But AntMan seemed really dumb to me. So did Thor at the time, and GotG is when I thought they had given up. 

I think the Series will be used to set up bigger events in the movies.  Almost like a Rogue One to Star Wars.  

That way people who want more background will have it, and yet you don’t HAVE to have seen it to follow the movies.  

Also Ironheart, Kate Bishop, Ms Marvel and I’m betting a Young Loki will get set up for a Secret Avengers movie."
Little Princess,"Armor Wars is widely considered one of the best, if not the best period, Iron Man stories.

We’ll most likely see Justin Hammer return and the intro of some other big Iron Man villains like Crimson Dynamo.

I wouldn’t call it bottom of the barrel. The only difference is that War Machine will he finally getting the spotlight rather than Iron Man"
Little Princess,"Well, you have to remember, when they first started making Marvel movies, Iron Man was a very odd choice in how to begin."
Little Princess,Yes.  Can they only make outer space/superhero stuff?  That’s not the only genre.
Little Princess,"not enough attention for this thread to get publicity...But then again I've seen many posts like this be brushed off as ""sjw"" bullshit.

Also I've noticed the reddit community as a bigger whole not very comfortable with this type of awareness. Could be because it's dominantly white, but I see posts like these that get too popular get down voted to hell."
Little Princess,"I see your point op I never really noticed until you pointed it out, it truly is a shame. At least The Walking Dead has a bad ass Asian. "
Little Princess,"What do you think of Fresh Off the Boat? It's nice to see an entire family, but it does seem to perpetuate some stereotypes."
Luther,I miss Alice. It's a pity they couldn't get her back for this.
Luther,"Season 1 was good, season 2 was mostly passable, but seasons 3 and 4 were corny cliche-ridden rubbish IMHO. Hope it recovers with this movie."
Luther,"kind of unrelated but Idris Elba produces EDM on the side and he actually has some BOPS

I love body shot"
Luther,"Hmm, how to leave a useful remark, without any kind of spoiler? Here goes...the writing of The Fallen Sun is as if a mis-matched team of adolescents thought it would be funny to take the post-it's they'd written of every half-remembered superhero pic and lotto-ball-bowl them—it is that coherent - sheesh. The first three decisions Luther makes or are made against him, as so wildly out of character, I had to stop the stream to check that I wasn't watching a parody. The pacing of the story build/development is as if they just raced to check every box 'yes'; yes,  we've covered a, b, c, etc. Illogical, nonsensical, VERY different vibe from 'Luther'. Whiplash inducing. If you like the Luther series - skip this."
Luther,"Saw this in theatres. Absolutely loved it. It was a dark pulsating crime thriller with a great lead and a compelling villain. They don't make movies like this anymore. It wasn't exactly Fincher but the tone reminded me off Girl with the golden with the dragon tattoo.

If you can see it on the big screen, you should. Its miles better than the mediocre Marvel DC movies that are the standard these days"
Luther,"The show never recovered after the first 2 seasons, don't know if I want to come back."
Luther,Perfectly cromulent.
Luther,"Can't wait to see this.

> released on Netflix

Oh, for fuck sake."
Luther,Police are portrayed as useless.
Luther,Stupid! Too many scenes were beyond pathetic and unrealistic. We couldn’t finish it! The writers were horrible.. Come on Idris you are better than this!!
Luther,Went to shit after season 2
Luther,"The movie was horrible.  so predictable, horrible acting/script.  I'm so disappointed as I was really looking forward to it.  I know it was BBC, but it seems like almost every Netflix movie is a dud lately."
Luther,You might want to finish the last episode of season five…
Luther,Oh... Well at least I know this beforehand now.
Luther,Great Villain and a great actress.
Luther,"No duck face flapping all over the screen?  Couldn't have asked for a better denouement to Luther's story.  This makes me retrospectively like her even more as a character since now I know that the writers didn't wear out her welcome like a bad penny.

I'll refresh my memory on season 1 before I pick up and start season 2 blind."
Luther,Can you just give us a rundown?
Luther,"Can anyone else chime in with their opinions on this? I've never watched Luther but I like Elba. I'm wondering if I watch it, whether there's a point where I'm better off stopping."
Luther,"I really enjoyed season 2, but the death of a certain character in that one really spelled the death of the show imo. It just wasn’t the same afterwards."
Luther,"and he's not bad. Driss the Londoner was his nom de plume in clubs, not sure if he still uses it"
Luther,"First comment I’ve actually agreed with, this film was so jarring it felt like one of those screen plays written by an AI, absolute shit do not watch this film"
Luther,"Tamer, less gritty than Fincher. It was an ok film with some great moments"
Luther,It's in theaters too.
Luther,Because they generally are
Luther,"There was an interview recently where they heavily hinted at bringing her back in a sequel, so I would say that scene was as ambiguous as it was supposed to be."
Luther,You might want to watch the last episode before you watch this
Luther,Sure thing Charles
Luther,"Do you like police dramas with ever-more-ridiculous criminals? Do you like like individual detectives squaring off against masterminds that somehow entrap and kill entire SWAT teams, yet stop to taunt the detective? If yes, you’re going to fucking LOVE Luther. 

And I don’t mean this ironically. I enjoyed all seasons."
Luther,"It's a police procedural set in a world that's intentionally a bit comic booky.

The character of Luther is not a good man. He has a strict absolute view on what is right and what is wrong. He is right, so anyone in his way is wrong. And anything he does to stop the villains in his life is right. Even if that's someone who isn't actually doing anything wrong.

The bad guys of the week aren't just normal detective show killers, to match Luther's self perception of himself as a hero, they're proper villains, typically quite cartoonish. 

The show presents itself as quite grounded but it doesn't take long before it shows its true colours, and it rubs a lot of people the wrong way if they went in expecting something different. 

It's a show that is more interested in being entertaining that realistic. 

The other aspect is a character that is introduced in the first episode called Alice, who is a fan favourite and an agent of chaos whenever she's on screen. She is not around for the whole show, so a lot of people perceive a drop in quality when she is not in a series.

In general it is a fun show to watch, with a unique approach to the genre, but it is a bit rocky at times. The good thing is that there really aren't many episodes, so it's an easy watch. The longest series was series 1 with 6 episodes."
Luther,"I'm the same person from above, but it's a British show with typically British very short seasons, so it's not a huge time investment. Season 1 is only 6 episodes and that's the longest one. Season 2 is only 4 episodes. It's a steady progression downwards in quality IMHO, so if you find season 2 bad, you should probably stop there. I didn't learn my lesson until later, but unlike a show like Heroes\*, the time investment wasn't so enormous that I felt like I wanted a receipt at the end so I could collect those hours back at the end of my life and use them to watch grass grow or paint dry instead.

*\*Obligatory disclaimer that the writers' strike supposedly ruining Heroes is a viral internet myth. It is misinformation. The show was ruined because the writers were idiots; also note that the strike was between seasons 2 and 3, not between 1 and 2. Spread the word in every Heroes thread.*"
Luther,"Nah just watch it all, season 3 is good, 4 is a step down but then 5 is better and this is apparently goodish"
Luther,It's a [Batman show without Batman](https://www.escapistmagazine.com/luther-is-a-batman-show-without-batman/)
Luther,"A lot of Luther is elevated by Elba’s performance, if you like him you’ll definitely enjoy it. Though earlier seasons are definitely stronger as the later seasons become burdened with trying to keep raising the stakes. Similar to Craig’s bond films, your suspension of disbelief gets called on more as the series progresses"
Luther,"Yeah, good take...perhaps it felt so jarring because Sydney/Bing was hallucinating - heh, also, your comment helped me clarify what I actually felt slogging through the parts I did watch - annoyed. It was NOT Luther."
Luther,"You're right, I never did finish it actually. Might as well start from the beginning before watching the movie. Thanks for the heads up."
Luther,"I suppose it depends on how plausible we're talking. Are they well written villains? Is there a valid reason why they're able to do what they do? Or are we talking ""Sherlock season 3"" here?"
Luther,"Those final two sentences really threw me for a loop, but points for internet comment originality. I am forced to like this comment.

I guess being a big fan of shows like Homicide: Life on the Street kinda disqualifies me from understanding the appeal of a show like this (unless Ruth Wilson is there to chew the scenery, I'll watch her in almost anything)."
Luther,"5 is mostly trash but it’s still watchable because alice is in it. 

Once Luther leaves the force it became a very different show tbh and the whole police doing it by the book vs Luther’s methods is pushed to the background. Will be checking this out to see how they handle it."
Luther,"Ffs just watch a couple episodes and make your own mind up. You say you're an Idris Elba fan, yet you haven't seen arguably his most prominent role?"
Luther,"More Season One (consistently), if Sherlock was a normal detective. In addition, no character (other than Luther himself) has plot armour."
Luther,"Enjoying an actor's work doesn't mean that I immediately run out and watch everything that they've ever been in. Considering the amount of high quality TV that's out there, I also prefer to know whether a show goes in the toilet at some point so I know when to stop watching. Do you also recommend that people watch every single episode of Heroes or The Walking Dead? 

But no, God forbid that we should try to discuss television in a television discussion forum. Why do we even have this review posted here anyway? Everyone should have to watch every single piece of entertainment for themselves to find out whether it's any good or not."
Luther,"There's like 12 episodes of Luther lol if you're curious watch it, if not don't."
Luther,It's interesting seeing the Indian version of Alice to Rudra's Luther.
Luther,"I have two questions:

1. Is this the same story as Luther, or are they inventing their own cases and whatnot?

2. Is there a musical element? This is always my barrier to Hindi and Indian entertainment."
Luther,"It took me an embarrassing amount of time to realize this isn’t talking about the show Lucifer. For some reason I thought “yeah Tom Ellis, he played Luther”"
Luther,Ajay Devgn is a damn good choice for the role. One of the most intense actors of Bollywood.
Luther,Where is this streamable?
Luther,If this is a remake of the bbc show did it ever get good? I loved Elba but got so bored two episodes in
Luther,I hear he has a big trident.
Luther,Now I wanna watch Musical Luther
Luther,"It is an official adaptation, so there are similarities, the cases have been adapted to Indian settings well enough"
Luther,"It's the same story. 6 episodes and all 6 have the same premise and story as the corresponding episode in the first season of Luther. They didn't take it in a new direction, just remade it."
Luther,"It's a series. They only use songs in modern Hindi shows when they make sense as part of the narrative. Most of the songs in these shows play as part of the background score rather than taking the focus like in Bollywood movies. 

Regarding your first question, I have no idea. I tried watching Luther but it wasn't for me so naturally I didn't watch the remake either assuming it'll be similar."
Luther,"Okay, Mike Tyson."
Luther,"From what little I’ve seen of Bollywood, a Hindi remake of Lucifer, with him being some Hindi deity, would probably be fascinating."
Luther,"To be honest he only looks good in intense roles. I don't like any of his newer comedic roles. Even the Singham schtick isn't working that well anymore. 

I'm watching Drishyam 2 rn and loving him in this film."
Luther,"Depends on where you live. Originals made by Disney+ India are scattered and not available at all in most countries. If you are in the US, it'll be on Hulu. In the UK, Canada and a few other countries they have a separate app called Hotstar where they upload all the Indian content. Disney's streaming strategy honestly seems more and more stupid when you see the number of streaming services they are running around the world when all of that can be handled by one single streaming service."
Luther,Luther is pretty much the same pace/tone for all of its episodes so if you didn't like the first two I doubt you'll like the other ones.
Luther,The strengths of Luther were mainly in the cast- Elba was amazing on screen and Ruth Wilson was a revelation. The show? Eh I think years later it was forgettavle.
Luther,"I saw him as Driss the Londoner back in the early 2000s, bloke was a good DJ"
Luther,With Elba? gimme that!
Luther,Luthier
Luther,"Thanks! As a British person intrigued by Indian and Hindi cinema, will I get anything new out of watching this?"
Luther,">They only use songs in modern Hindi shows when they make sense as part of the narrative. Most of the songs in these shows play as part of the background score rather than taking the focus like in Bollywood movies. 

I think they wanted to know is Luther gonna bust out singing at some point."
Luther,Did one of the cases involve a missing murder weapon (gun)
Luther,He was great in Golmaal films though. Man has comedic timing but his films have gone down in quality recently.
Luther,I still love season 1 but it goes downhill fast.
Luther,[deleted]
Luther,"Personally as someone who enjoys watching regional remakes like this, the interesting part is always the minor changes they make so that it translates culturally."
Luther,Try watching The Family Man. Its my favourite indian series to date.
Luther,No
Luther,Read the second paragraph of my comment please.
Luther,He looked quite out of place in the latter Golmaal films.
Luther,oh FFS i've walked into that :s
Luther,"Short version - Alice has a vendetta against mobster George Cornelius from the earlier seasons because he stiffed her on a deal and tried to kill her, and she dragged John into it.  Benny got killed over it.  When John was getting revenge for that, he cut a deal with George but George double crossed him and set up John for blackmail.  John lied to Alice about George being dead to try to calm down the situation so he could solve it.  Alice found out John was lying.  Alice went to confront John and killed the new partner for that season Catherine.  That pretty much ended any hopes of getting out of it for both of them."
Luther,"Aha, I’d remembered everything apart from John lying about George being dead! Thanks very much for clearing it up for me!"
Luther,i didn't appreciate this show enough when i was younger
Luther,MLK jr day is a PSYOP by the Reagan administration to keep people perpetually bored of the Reverend so a wave of interest in his writing never triggers another civil rights reform.
Luther,"Angry young people are always trying to use Letters from a Birmingham jail to turn MLK into Malcolm X. That wasn't who he was most of the time, or what his message was. He was, as you noted, a Reverend. His message was about love. Reddit hates religion and finds messages about love ""boring"" but that is what resonated with people. Being angry is easy. You are supposed to love each other."
Luther,\#NotMyLoofa
Luther,"meh, Luther has run its course"
Luther,By Kevin Hart.
Luther,U fokin wut m8?
Luther,How bout just make a new show in the same universe.
Luther,Ofc. We've already seen shit ton of new versions of older shows. That is going to go on forever.
Luther,Been debating whether I should go back and finish this. Pretty sure I dropped it around season 3.
Luther,It really hasn’t
Luther,"This was always weird to me how MLK Road/Street/Avenue whatever was always a shit hole in other cities. In Cleveland Ohio, Martin Luther King Jr Blvd is very nice and has memorials to all the ethnic groups that are part of the city. Our MLK Blvd ends into a world renown Art museum and Natural History Museum. Here's the Google Street View below, I grew up with kids from other cities talking crap about MLK Streets and I just thought they were idiots.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJcbev7m_Xk"
Luther,"Yeah tru and all the 

  
responds I got was it stupid"
Luther,Obama is the white moderate MLK warned us about
Luther,I love how Luther just scolds himself in the third person xD. One of the most hilarious series I have watched lol
Luther,Great cast.Its nice to see Aaron Pierre getting a pretty sharp rise. hes in blade to (in a few other Disney projects it seems).
Luther,i'll wait for the Daily Wire version that casts white people in these roles /s
Luther,"These things really do go in infinite circles.

10 years ago I was tasked with a college essay about a prominent Black American. I chose Sidney Poitier, who revolutionised Black representation on screen with his portrayals of educated, respected, dynamic and powerful leading roles. The main critique levelled at his career is that he always played someone dealing with the issue of being black, in films like 'Guess Who's Coming to Dinner' and 'In the Heat of the Night'. His films usually explored themes of race and his characters experiencing racism.

The conclusion of many critics was that what entertainment needed to move on from Poitiers typecasting was colourblind roles for black actors, like Denzel's character in Training Day (a role which various white and black actors attempted to get). Luther is a good example of this too, nobody would want another actor in the role - but conceivably the character could have been played by Benedict Cumberbatch or Henry Golding (much as Russell Crowe was up for Denzel's lead in Training Day)

Now it seems that the script has flipped the other way, all black roles and characters need introspection of the overall experience of being black. We can't have a show like Luther, without making it into something that can be studied and referred to in a critical race theory class. Don't get me wrong, this can be a good thing. The current Falcon/Winter Soldier series is doing a good job at the exploring these themes.


I think eventually things will flip again. Sometimes escapism and pure entertainment are what audiences crave. We don't need a scene in Luther where someone in a court building assumes he's the defendant. It wouldn't add anything to the plot. Not everything has to be so po faced."
Luther,You can't compare Downtown Abbey with a TV show that's set in the modern times.
Luther,"I don’t really understand this point.  The article said that the character wasn’t written as black, but because Idris Elba got the part, he was a black character.  I mean isn’t that exactly the fucking thing that we’re all trying to achieve?  That when a character is created, any actor can play it?  By then complaining that the character isn’t “black enough” it seems to me to be taking a step back.  Why does every single black person have to be part of “black culture”?  Isn’t that just enforcing cultural stereotypes?

This seems like a very regressive view to me.  By all means celebrate black people’s backgrounds, but don’t put them all in a box marked ‘black’ and assume that no one gets to be anything else."
Luther,I just wanna watch smart angry black man chase bad people.
Luther,"No she didn't. Luther is a great show and anyone who thinks ""he isn't black enough"" because he doesn't fit black stereotypes is a racist. Hell, neither Luther nor Idris is even even Caribbean descent so for a ""chief of diversity"" she sure makes some stupid assumptions."
Luther,"*For context: in 2010, Luther launched starring Idris Elba as a brooding cop who invests so much in his job he neglects his personal life. This type has been played by white actors so often that it’s a well-worn, if beloved, TV cliche. Yet for a Black actor, a lead role in a British TV series – especially one in the ever-popular detective genre – remains a vanishingly rare opportunity.*

Yeah it's like black men are a different kind of entity that doesn't behave this way. Like the only issues a black man can have is dealing with racism.

Let me tell you how it is, we're all beigns dealing mostly with the same internal issues in our personal lives being black, white, yellow and purple, if you're Thanos.

God, even Thanos has relationship issues with his daughter. That's very human I guess?"
Luther,"The article is still BS tho.

>What is it *actually* like to be a Black man working at a senior level in an “institutionally racist” organisation like the Metropolitan police? (Or, for that matter, a Black woman working within a white-dominated one like the BBC?) How would you square your professional identity with family and friends who likely have their own complicated relationships with your employer? Luther was never going to be the series to explore that territory, however dramatically fruitful the terrain. But that’s OK – let Luther do Luther.

Let's take Will Smith's character on Independence Day. Should a portion of the movie be devoted to his struggles as a black man working in an ""institutionally racist"" organization?

How about Will Smith's character in Bad Boys? Sure, he ""behaved more black"" but the movie still didn't tackle his struggles as a black man working in an ""institutionally racist"" organization.

Demanding movies and TV Shows starring POC to *focus* on their struggles as POC is absurd and actually quite racist since they cannot simply be a marine/detective/doctor, etc...they have to be a black marine/black detective/black doctor.

And that's as regressive as it comes. 

If there's a proper 007 film starring Lashana Lynch, I fully expect it to be about a kickass agent killing terrorists, not an interpersonal drama about being a black woman in an ""institutionally racist"" organization."
The Little Lulu Show,Would love some bloopers
The Little Lulu Show,Feels like it just started. I can't believe it's over already.
The Little Lulu Show,Have Nick Offerman and Bella talk shit to each other since we missed out on Bill fighting with Ellie
The Little Lulu Show,I don't want to spoil any future stories for myself. Can I play the video game after season 1 ends?
The Little Lulu Show,You guys would definitely check out Hot Ones most recent episode. Its Pedro Pascal himself!
The Little Lulu Show,If they don’t reenact the musical alternate ending I’m gonna be very disappointed.
The Little Lulu Show,"I wish they had more in depth videos about what goes into making each episode. For the final few seasons of Game of Thrones, HBO released like 20 minute long clips about the costumes, the stunt choreography, the special effects and nearly everything else behind the scenes. It have great insight into all the work that goes into each installment."
The Little Lulu Show,so mixed with the podcast that's \~3h of TLoU content on Sunday. fucking eh.
The Little Lulu Show,It's been a gift watching these two people star in sci-fi fantasy shows. I can't wait to see what they do next in other movies.
The Little Lulu Show,Gotta get my fix!
The Little Lulu Show,Guess I'll be watching it while silently weeping. It's something I guess. 😭
The Little Lulu Show,"I like the actors, but after watching the first two episodes I had to turn it off. The screenplay and dialog are too formulaic and predictable. In fact, all story lines appear to be lifted from: A Boy and His Dog, Dawn of the Dead, WD, or any other zombie post apocalyptic narrative. I found incredibly tedious to sit through. Again, the acting was fine."
The Little Lulu Show,Cool advert
The Little Lulu Show,"I kinda thought they'd expand more on the characters that we love, there's a whole backstory in the days before Joel meets Ellie that I really wanted to see...

9 episodes and 1 was a dlc episode that came after the main game was out for a year. 

Bit of a shame considering Last of Us 2 has even less Joel."
The Little Lulu Show,"The last of us and the mandalorian are the same show.

Prove me wrong"
The Little Lulu Show,[removed]
The Little Lulu Show,[removed]
The Little Lulu Show,Thats good. I feel like I wanted something akin to the House of the Dragon specials they released each week for these episodes. At least we get this.
The Little Lulu Show,"People should watch Prospect with Pedro Pascal. 

His dialogue in that movie is great."
The Little Lulu Show,Or some Joel and Ellie fake deaths like when they die in the game.
The Little Lulu Show,"apparently pedro pascal did his l.a. accent a lot while on set, as did his other cast members. would like to see that as well"
The Little Lulu Show,The Laughs Of Us.
The Little Lulu Show,I feel like 10-12 episodes would have been perfect. 9 is on the short side.
The Little Lulu Show,1st game shouldve been 2 seasons tbh
The Little Lulu Show,"For sure can play Part I since it will end where season 1 ends. And who knows maybe you’ll want to play part II afterwards anyway, not a spoiler if it’s ultimately going to be the same story :). I think it’s a story worth experiencing via it’s original medium first."
The Little Lulu Show,You better end up playing Part II fairly soon because I feel like you’re not gonna be able to avoid spoiler talk after season 1 ends
The Little Lulu Show,"Yes, season 1 is just the first game including dlc. It's a great game, if you've ps5 or pc you can pick it up cheap enough if you keep an eye on sales. Otherwise you got the ps4 remaster which is still really good"
The Little Lulu Show,Play Part 1 as it won’t spoil anything and it’s an incredible game. Don’t play part 2 if you don’t want the rest of the show spoiled
The Little Lulu Show,"""You're smart"" - Pedro to Sean"
The Little Lulu Show,"I just watched that episode, it was amazing. Pedro Pascal is so damn charming, I just want to hang out with him"
The Little Lulu Show,"[Listen to the podcast to scratch a bit of that itch](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/hbos-the-last-of-us-podcast/id1660320068) \- I believe they are all over 40 mins long and this includes Druckman, Mazin and it is hosted by Troy Baker. Can't get more inside than that!"
The Little Lulu Show,"Jo and Mal from the Ringer-verse are also doing an interview/recap with Craig Maizin and Neil Druckman, so an extra 2 hours there if you want"
The Little Lulu Show,"Pedro has to do a project with Nathan Fillion where they can play brothers. Christ, their speaking voices even sound alike."
The Little Lulu Show,Maybe they’re saving that storyline for later seasons to help even out joel time
The Little Lulu Show,"They both have different show title names and are also set in a different universe.

Damn, that was easy"
The Little Lulu Show,Why would anyone care about proving you wrong? Demomstrate that you're correct or your assertion is to be laughed at and dismissed.
The Little Lulu Show,"I mean they're literally different. 

Dumbass."
The Little Lulu Show,"This apple and this orange are the same thing.

Prove me wrong."

The Little Lulu Show,"It would be a little *too* on the meta-nose.

But I would have loved to see Pascal killing Baker while being unable to talk. Voiceless at it were.

For those few not in the know: Joel in the show killing the actor in the show (Buddy Boy) that played Joel in the game (voice + motion caption)."
The Little Lulu Show,Is this a spoiler? What the fuck bro
The Little Lulu Show,Oh mah gahhhhhhh!
The Little Lulu Show,They did make 10 episodes. HBO then combined the first two into a movie length premiere because they thought it worked better dramatically and because otherwise most of the pilot would be the 2003 flashback.
The Little Lulu Show,It is 10 with the double length of the first episode.
The Little Lulu Show,Having 9 episodes where two of them are around one hour and 20 minutes is what I’d prefer
The Little Lulu Show,"How? The game takes about 15 hours to complete, most of which is gameplay. At most this could have 10 episodes instead of 9, but there is not enough story for 2 seasons."
The Little Lulu Show,Gotta love how a mildly unpopular opinion gets you downvoted to -44.
The Little Lulu Show,That’s too much. 12 episodes I could get into. 2 seasons is overkill.
The Little Lulu Show,"Unfortunately it’s not on PC until the end of this month, and it’s $60 so probably won’t be cheap for a while."
The Little Lulu Show,The stuff that he says isn't even *that* funny but he's so goddamn charming that Sean is losing it and I'm laughing just as much.
The Little Lulu Show,"Hope so, they nailed the actors and Tommy needs more screen time, I want to know what Joel did to survive, if they can tell a new story about characters like Bill and Frank they can tell something new about the actual focal characters."
The Little Lulu Show,The easiet gottem of all time
The Little Lulu Show,"OK, you grumpy folks..The same guy, Joel, take a little child along several seasons. The child has superpowers that nobody has, and Joel has no purpose in life, till he meets the kid. The purpose now is to take him to some enigmatic place with some enigmatic people. Once he delivers, they want to take the kid down.

THE SAME SHOW.

You do not agree?

ok, how about this:

The last of us is the prequel. Ellie develops some symptoms like greeny face and longevity. Also she can be in touch with mother nature. in season 7 Joel get ill and die, and Ellie manage to take an eye of Joel, the last part not contaminated by the fungus, so she can bury him next his brother.

She place the eye ina sferic metallic ball and hit the ground. Finally she cant say goodbye and keep the ball as an amulet.

Years later, season 35, Ellie use the rounded eye of Joel, stored in a sferic ball of steel, to get Joel DNA and to revive him. They need berskar because the weekness of the skeleton, so they go to mandalor, and train as mandalorian.

It turns out Ellie is shrinking, so the ears seem to be huge, and  greening step by step.

As the reconstruction of Joel is a succes, an evil force try to make more clones,  But they need more Joel DNA.

They take Joel, kill him and get all DNA they need. They  turn the startup into a success, and start a special program of mass production on clones!

Once she finds out, she get mad about and convince a new Joel  to destroy the  Clone factory with all the clones but the last one. Ellie get injured and unable to speak again, and almost a fern by now.

The bush with ears and Silver-helmet go for the gallaxy looking for the misterious people and the enigmatic place, while grogu -she doesnt feel like a girl any more and changed her name- plays with the sferic-steel ball, that contains the last piece of his friend. They travel again and forever.

The end"

The Little Lulu Show,"In case this is serious, no it’s not a spoiler lol. Just happens in video games a lot"
The Little Lulu Show,"It’s a joke, bro. They both die a lot while playing the game."
The Little Lulu Show,"Games been out almost 10 years.  If you missed it that long, that's on you."
The Little Lulu Show,Let's put a pin in that.
The Little Lulu Show,"Yeah as people have pointed out, when you take out all the slow sneaking, puzzle solving, and random combat out, the actual plot of the final chapter of the game is only like 15 minutes"
The Little Lulu Show,I would have liked a little more of the connective tissue between sections of the game. I think we probably could have gotten 12 or 13 episodes while giving us little asides during their trip to KC or the three month gap on their way to Colorado.
The Little Lulu Show,"The show doesn't need to be constrained by the game, as they showed with episode 3 (an example i liked) and introducing the Kathleen character (an example I liked less)."
The Little Lulu Show,By using the episodes to show more of a relationship between Joel and Ellie. 8 episodes so far and 2 of them were basically standalones.
The Little Lulu Show,"well they already added stuff into the show that wasn’t in the game, so they could’ve just idk, wrote more into the storyline.

i dont care either way but its not like they couldn’t have done it."
The Little Lulu Show,They could have easily flexed their writing chops and added more episodes. Develop relationships properly to have better payoffs instead of introducing a character and killing them off the same episode.
The Little Lulu Show,"Yeah, not two seasons, but I think 10 or 11 episodes would have been better. The quality of TLOU isn't in the Joel and Ellie story alone. It's that they exist in a lived in world. They spent an episode on Bill and Frank. Everyone loved it. It had a very limited connection to the game, outside of them existing in the game. They gave KC residents two halves of two episodes. They gave the DLC an episode. They opened with that couple living in the middle of nowhere. It's the world building naughtydog did that gave TLOU a foundation to tell a great story.

Give me an episode on ish and kyle getting people together, and their downfall... Hell, that's easily two episodes with ish writing on the wall to no go inside, and wandering off closing the episode.

I think they really missed the best part of the game by hiding an Easter egg for ish.


I also dislike how little time we spend with Joel and Ellie just talking, but I don't see how that extends episode count vs making episodes unbearably longer."
The Little Lulu Show,"Doesnt have to be just the game look at ep3 and the whole bill thing, couldve ran s1 to the end of the city or even joel getting injured if you want to add some story beats to the cannibal arc. Point being it doesnt feel like joel and ellie have the same relationship they had in the game, even abit forced at times, and thats not going to make me care when xyz happens in a s2 based on a game that hit pretty 'meh' to begin with.

And thats a mild take, imagine those that are still seething about xyz happening at all"
The Little Lulu Show,"The last ep could have been 2-3 eps easy. And with one episode left, it really doesn't feel like there's enough room to finish the story properly. (I hope to be proven wrong, but expect it to be rushed)

And theres a bunch of stiff that could have been in there, that just isn't.

There was easily enough content for 15-18 eps"
The Little Lulu Show,"Was thinking the same, but they can be angy and enjoy their subpar seasons 2 & 3, god forbid 4

S1EP3 best itll ever be"
The Little Lulu Show,"Well get ready for that with 2nd game, i could see two 8 ep seasons doing just fine for the first"
The Little Lulu Show,No one's reading all that. Don't watch if you don't like it🤷‍♂️
The Little Lulu Show,[removed]
The Little Lulu Show,"I played the game...and the fakeouts are very obviously fake outs, otherwise the story ends"
The Little Lulu Show,"That’s why I was having a hard time seeing people say ep 8 & 9 needed to be longer when they saw their run times 

Like, take out all the gameplay and combat and plot wise I can see how the creators said we don’t need a full hour"
The Little Lulu Show,Yeah. They did that entirely anyways. Imagine being ok with them not spending at least 1 episode on it. Or injected as 5 minute set pieces each episode.
The Little Lulu Show,"Kathleen was fine, I guess. I just find it weird that they spent two episodes with her, Henry, and Sam. Henry and Sam have an effect on Joel and Ellie, sure, but a lot of Ellie’s development comes from her time with David. We saw a lot of it, but something was missing. I don’t know what, but if KC can have two episodes, there’s no reason they couldn’t flesh out David & James more, or alternatively expand on what the ending is. 43 minutes is short to wrap it up, regardless of if there’s so much gameplay."
The Little Lulu Show,"It's both really, episode 3 was great but looking at the season as a whole it feels like each episode is an ""arc"" and it's missing some connective tissue. There's a lot of talk about how the game is about 14 hours anyway and they can use all that gameplay time to flesh out other characters, which is great, but it's during the gameplay that Joel and Ellie's relationship builds. The show is still really good but I think they could've struck a better balance with another episode or two."
The Little Lulu Show,"The rest of the game from this point is under 30 minutes even including all the gameplay, stopping to listen to the recorders, reading the notes, etc. So they could cut to an actual play through of all the remaining content and it would only fill half the time slot, being rushed isn’t a concern. (I checked a play through on YouTube for the actual runtime. 28 minutes from David’s death to the end credits.)"
The Little Lulu Show,"who says i dont like both of them? 

i just say that are the same story, with the same principal character."
The Little Lulu Show,That's why they're saying they would be funny post show behind the scenes bloopers. Not something seriously used in the show.
The Little Lulu Show,"8 could have been longer. We definitely missed out on David and Ellie having to fight off infected , that would have been a great 10 minute segment in the show as it was important in the game"
The Little Lulu Show,"Episode 3: universally lauded for all the extra material added by the show runners.

Episode 9: let's just rush through it as fast as possible because it was all gameplay."
The Little Lulu Show,"The show has fallen into the trap if ""its a zombie apocalypse with no zombies"" 

A brief aside where they encounter infected, like the tunnel section of the game, is kinda needed for world building.

That and a few more moments of actually showing us the relationship they've forged. (Including the DLC, instead of showing us in the present, was absolutely a mistep).

And a little more space to let the ending breath, and possibly even a moment to set up the next beat, wouldn't go astray.

But there's not the runtime for that now.

I dunno. I guess we all find our tomorrow night how they go with the finale."
The Little Lulu Show,"You say this as if this isn't an entire subgenre of content - a kid and a father / parental figure. You'll find a lot of other shows and movies like this, I think you're basing most of your opinion on the fact that Pedro acts in both and both are airing simultaneously."
The Little Lulu Show,"Craig Mazin has a podcast with Neil Druckmann where they explain that things like that are combat for the game. They work for the game. It would not necessarily translate for a show. Repeated infected would get old, fast. See: TWD. 

I also would watch the show for what it is, and not always compare it to the game. It keeps the core story but does its own thing

I’m grateful for Craig and Neil’s adaptation/translation"
The Little Lulu Show,Both episodes were very highly reviewed. Episode 8 has the second highest user score of the series and received largely positive critic reviews. It’s not like it got trashed
The Little Lulu Show,"I never said that at all.

And the scene I mentioned isn’t repeated infected and a slog of a scene. 5-10 minute scene of them fighting off a hoard would have absolutely worked on the show."
The Little Lulu Show,"The combat section with David was what causes him to eye her. How the fuck David saying Ellie has a ""violent heart"" even makes sense when he and the audience didn't see her engaging in violence in the show?"
The Little Lulu Show,Lol I stopped caring after they revealed why John killed himself and thought there was only like one more season. Did they have any other interesting plots since then?
The Little Lulu Show,"Lol. This show is so insanely bad it's like watching a car crash. I kind of enjoy the hate watch, but I hope the entire cast is killed off."
The Little Lulu Show,"Damn, not what I wanted to see at all.."
The Little Lulu Show,"Too many sci fi / horror tv vets on the bench, bring on the ghosts. If they had ghosts they’d be doing Ghosts numbers"
The Little Lulu Show,"I watched a couple episodes of the first season years ago. It's total tragedy porn, Ron Livingston is a character that committed suicide and is barely in the show and it seems like everyone is fucking each other and gets cancer? lol"
The Little Lulu Show,Just imagine that every character in the show has lived through every possible life tragedy in the span of a few years - that’s pretty much what this show is like.
The Little Lulu Show,Newest wheelchair Jimmy plot dropped
The Little Lulu Show,Why did he kill himself?
The Little Lulu Show,This show didn’t know what it wanted other than being a “This is Us” knock off then totally going off the rails.
The Little Lulu Show,"100% agree. I swear the writers have no idea what they will write for the next episode until it's finished filming. There are plots that go nowhere, twists that make no sense and terrible dialogue."
Littlest Pet Shop,It was a really good show. Belonged on a much better network than the HUB.
Littlest Pet Shop,Curtis and Paget were great. The best thing about this show to me though was that Dan didn't always lose. I find when the protagonist is treated like Donald Duck it makes me feel frustrated and lose interest.
Littlest Pet Shop,"The episode '**New Mexico**' was my introduction to the show and it has been one of the most memorable episodes in kid television.

It's just so funny and insanely weird."
Littlest Pet Shop,"Great show, and good timing considering I just started a Prime trial."
Littlest Pet Shop,I'm glad to hear that it's on streaming somewhere. It's one of my all time favorite shows
Littlest Pet Shop,[https://vimeo.com/272225597](https://vimeo.com/272225597)
Littlest Pet Shop,"This made me happy. Was just gonna buy the season 1 dvd, which is 5 bucks on amazon. But I’m glad the other seasons are on prime. I know what I’m binging."
Littlest Pet Shop,"Late, but it's also fully available on Tubi 100% free (no paid sub or anything needed).  
Just started watching it and it has this mood I've been looking for for yeaaars, just the whole aesthetic of the show is a breath of fresh air.  
Nice to watch something and not have messages, lessons, etc shoved in.  
As Korvo said: ""Sometimes you don't need a lesson at the end of the chaos to have a good time."""
Littlest Pet Shop,"I’m an adult watching it again haha it’s hilarious, but of course fits a certain demographic"
Littlest Pet Shop,"The Hub as a concept was a good idea for a channel IMO, but Hasbro owning part of it scared away other toy companies from buying ad slots. Combine that with the fact that it's deep cable not on a lot of packages and you can see why the economics were never going to work.

Besides this show, I'm grateful it also gave us The Aquabats! Super Show, one of their only other TV-PG non-toy commercial shows."
Littlest Pet Shop,Def not a kids show.
Littlest Pet Shop,What kind of pet shop is filled with rambunctious yahoos and hot jazz music at 1:00 in the morning?
Littlest Pet Shop,"the dank, THE DANK"
Littlest Pet Shop,I totally forgot about the monkey knife fight!
Littlest Pet Shop,"lol may as well say that he stole the character of Erran Morrad from that Adam Sandler Zohan movie, they're both Israeli commandos! 
  
You're right, both of them are satires of politically correct ""do-good"" liberals, though the type that SBC satirizes through Nira Cain are way more prevalent now than they were when Mike Judge did The Goode Family. "
Littlest Pet Shop,"ACT 2

From the adjoining dorm rooms, we SMASH CUT to...

Sloane, head down on a table. Zoom out and we find the new Freshman orientation/hall mate posse sitting around her at the honorary campus diner. Everyone is trying to convince Sloane that her life is not that bad. Clearly it is that bad. Each tells anecdotes of when they were embarrassed, except Gary. He keeps his cards close to the chest. Eva, ear hustles from her ostracized booth.

A passerby drops a couple of fliers for a bar party in the middle of the circle of friends. Sloane smiles at the prospect of going to a party, only to be deflated by the “must be 21 to enter” disclaimer. Dejected. “It's our first night! We have to go out.” That's when Julia presents the holy grail of party-going minors, a fake ID. Fuck it. Let's do it. They scoop up one of the fliers—Eva gets the other.

CT Stacey and Ed sitting quietly on their beds, pushed together to make a King. Why not be comfortable if we have to stay? Ralph makes weird faces when he hasn't reached full disclosure, like now. It's been his Tourette's-like symptom since childhood. Stacey notices, calls him out, but immediately regrets that decision. ""Since you guys can't work, the only way you can afford your miscellaneous bills is...if Sloane works. Your accounts look pretty bad."" Ed and Stacey's faces slowly light up. Sloane has to pay our bills?? This is actually great.

Sloane flies into the room with newfound energy—let's make a deal.

Step 3: BARGAINING

In the middle of her plea, there's a KNOCK at the door. Fe Fe gets quickly tucked away. It's the RA, Santos, making his welcoming rounds. Even her bargaining doesn't keep Sloane from noticing his good looks, until her dad opens his mouth again, that is. And when he does, Santos gives Sloane a full once-over. Mom saw it. Daddy didn't.

Santos is aware of the family's situation. He tries to encourage acceptance by coming to tonight's blast-off party. In this very moment, Ed realizes he is in friggin' undergrad, finally. ""Party?! Let's do it."" Sloane pivots out, Eva saunters in. ""I'm so glad there are some parents around. I lost my leg to a shark when mine weren't watching me carefully."" Awkward. ""Maybe you guys would like to go to this party—we’re all too young to get in. Give you a little space from your daughter."" Surprisingly, they didn't see her horns sprouting.

THE CLUB is massive, multi-floored, converted warehouse. Like soldiers on the front line, the gang strategizes on how to get past the BOUNCER. Nerves build; they see the line wraps around the building. Little does Sloane know, the plan is for her to go first. Jamanda and Julia fall back just out of Sloane and Gary's earshot. ""She's a friggin' supermodel and the only way we're getting in with these crap IDs!"" Julia knows they're in for a hard sell. They team up on her.

CT the bouncer holding Sloane's ID. Her crew stands semi-confidently behind her. The bouncer looks at them, licks his thumb and rubs the license. Passes that test. When is your birthday? Easy enough. ""What year?"" Crap! Only one shot left, womanly persuasion. It actually works—the bouncer is mesmerized. Gary pulls up the rear, only breaking away from his texting for a moment, and gives the bouncer a “good game” slap.

The foursome follows the biggest herd to find...Sloane's dancing parents. Life is officially over. Gary drapes his arm around her shoulders in support and they all move Sloane upstairs.

They make a pact: it's an all or nothing night. Sloane is more in than the rest, having just been shot dead for the umpteenth time today.

MONTAGE

Whiskey slaps! Beer pong. Belly button shots on the bar. Sloane dancing on the bar...she so into it that she's closes her eyes.

MEANWHILE, A Clockwork Orange style, under-aged drinking raid filters into every room of the club. Ed and Stacey keep grooving as people are escorted out. They actually chuckle and raise their drinks. Ha! The cops don't even pause at their old asses.

Upstairs, Jamanda and Julia dance, laughing hysterically, watching Sloane get loose. Julia signals to the ladies restroom and Jamanda nods to join her. They’ve checked out just as the campus police flood their floor. Gary, for whatever reason, has a stick on mustache and soul patch in his pocket. He gets into disguise and posts up on a wall, sipping his drink. Cops pass right by him. Everyone else flees by any means necessary, stairwells, back doors, windows—including the bathroom window that Jamanda and Julia jump out of.

Everyone, that is, except our Sloane, who is dancing unaware on the bar by herself. She's all alone and completely screwed. We see the now empty room from Sloane’s POV, save a multitude of cops watching her dance. Kill the music and she opens her eyes.

CT the SOUND of captivity: Fishwell University’s drunk tank doors close on Sloane's holding cell.

Step 4: DEPRESSION.

Yeah, those are real tears.
"
Littlest Pet Shop,"ACT 3

Sloane stands before a judge in campus court, still in last night's party clothes. Unbeknownst to her, Ed and Stacey sit in the back of the room—they got wind. The judge lectures Sloane on proper collegiate behavior and how she’s off to a bad start. He's letting her off easy by not informing her parents. “Instead, you’ll be useful to society. You are hereby ordered to get a job.”

Stacey, the worried mom, is late to catch her husband's enthusiasm. He nudges her. His eyebrows attach to his hairline. This is it! What?? OH! Now they don’t have to tell her to get a job; she has to get one anyway. Perfect. They tiptoe out of the proceedings.

By the time Sloane gets back to the dorm, Stacey is flipping through the course catalog, lounging on her now dressed bed. She cuddles with her mom, without telling her what happened. Stacey receives it and asks for Sloane's school supply list. ""Mom, I don’t need glue sticks. I just need books."" Fine. Go get your schedule.

Step 5: ACCCEPTANCE.

Sloane decides not to argue it right now. Gets the schedule and drops it on her mom's beat up dorm desk. Ed pacing nervously, OUTSIDE of the dorm room dialing on his cell. ""Ralph! This is all too real. I was terrible in school, you know that. We're going through this class catalog and everything, literally, seems like rocket science.” CT Ralph, eating per usual. ""Dude. You're like fifty. Play to your strengths, wing it. Or take Sloane’s classes and copy her work, whatever.” Ding, ding!

INSIDE Stacey’s at her desk, giving in to worry also. The course catalog looms next to her. She gets on Skype. Needs advice. ""I’m used to being the room mom, not the mom in a room. What am I doing here? I don’t know the first thing about taking or picking classes!” We now see that she is venting to Ralph. ""Stace, cool out. Just piggyback Sloane’s classes. Maybe you’ll get super close or something."" He shines a light brighter than the sun on her life, originality has no place here. Zoom in to the course catalog next to Sloane’s schedule.

A load off, Stacey gets back to unpacking. She opens the “For Dummies” box and inside, her brag book—a bittersweet moment. Ed creeps in and wraps his arms around her. “No one can touch you with degrees or professional experience here.” She rests her head on his shoulder. He notices Slone’s schedule on Stacey’s desk. Reaches while she buries her head.

CT Sloane exits her room for a stroll. She unleashes her hair from a bun just as Santos appears, “like the hair.” Shower-capped Eva peeks out just then, and rushes back in for beautification. Sloane decides to use her newfound womanly prowess on this crush, regardless of mom and dad still living with her. She’s still awkward at it, but determined. Gets rewarded with a pleasant exchange. By the time Eva comes back, Eduardo is gone and Sloane is walking away, smiling big. Through the threshold of her dorm room and MATCH CUT TO HER FRESHMAN ENGLISH CLASS, same smile...until Ed and Stacey wave at her, signaling the empty seat between them for her to sit in. AGAIN?!

Step 1...

Pretty Little Liars,What does this have to do with Andor?
Pretty Little Liars,"So is this technically not Original Sin season 2, or can shows just change their name now?"
Pretty Little Liars,"It’s season 2, they just changed the name.
This is a trend that’s starting to be a bit more common. Stargirl did it, so did American Horror Story"
Pretty Little Liars,I'm sorry. I didn't realize Andor is the only television series that exists.
Pretty Little Liars,"I grew up with the OG and eventually come to hate the show but I’ve been really enjoying this show.

It’s not peak HBO/peak TV but it’s still pretty fun. 

I just hope it doesn’t turn into the mess that Riverdale became."
Pretty Little Liars,I enjoyed this show but I'm shocked to see it's getting a second season.
Pretty Little Liars,"Fans of the original series and fans of horror movies/shows should definitely give this one a shot. Not a perfect show, but definitely a fun watch!"
Pretty Little Liars,"just finished the first season last night and although it's not excellent writing and the dialogues can be awkward/unrealistic, I quite enjoyed it! it's mindless fun and the group dynamic between the girls is cute. Will watch the second season!"
Pretty Little Liars,I am addicted to this show. It is campy and silly but also a great homage to slasher horror and is enjoyable. Which is all I can ask for in a show these days
Pretty Little Liars,Love this 🙌
Pretty Little Liars,"Fuck yeah, my fiancé and I love this show"
Pretty Little Liars,"This show is terrible, sorry, but it was one of the worst shows i ever watch, and I watch a lot...
The only way this show can become better is if embrace the slasher part, everyone in this show is so unlikeable."
Pretty Little Liars,Why? Season 1 literally wrapped up everything.
Pretty Little Liars,I'm shocked hbo will greenlight this type of show. This is very CW or NBC. Maybe they are targeting the teen market
Pretty Little Liars,"I started watching when it was on netflix. I read episode recaps to understand the story. I made it to Season 2 and halfway through it I lost access to my buddies Netflix account. My old iPhone I had the app on stopped working and I didnt see my friend for a long while. By the time I had another friends account, the show was already off.

But just with 2 seasons, I realized how quickly so many characters drop off and dont return. 

Does the show drop off? Because at some point the missing girl returns and the story shifts atleast from what I gather. I've been lazy on picking up where i left off so yeah."
Pretty Little Liars,"Honestly, if you don’t watch the last minute, it certainly works as a mini series. But the last minute does imply a continuation, but doesn’t leave too much space for further story"
Pretty Little Liars,You should watch the gossip girl reboot...
Pretty Little Liars,"SpookyTupperware, i agree w/ you 100%."
Pretty Little Liars,Not based on the last minute.
Pretty Little Liars,It’s not HBO. It’s HBO max. This show would never be an HBO show.
Pretty Little Liars,I can see that. I just figured it was a cheeky little horror nod since things wrapped up well enough.
Pretty Little Liars,"Yeah I’m actually a bit annoyed that they’re doing another season, they really don’t need to. But I suppose as long as it’s good that’s all that matters"
Pretty Little Liars,No cliffhangers or things that need to be explained happened in the last minute.
Pretty Little Liars,"""This show looks terrible. Who would watch this?"" asks mid twenties male."
Pretty Little Liars,"A popular guy in my Highschool posted Facebook status that contained a major spoiler about a PLL major event or finale, intentionally trying to spoil the show before it aired. Not sure how he knew the spoiler but it ended up being true, and the dude was near crucified at school the next day by the female population."
Pretty Little Liars,"Wow, this actually looks good"
Pretty Little Liars,"I just hope they have a better explanation as to how A pulls of their feats than the original A from PLL, who was revealed to do all of these magical acts through having Super ADHD."
Pretty Little Liars,I might check this out? I enjoyed PLL early on but bailed by season 3 or 4
Pretty Little Liars,I feel like Charlie Brown and the football but it could be good.
Pretty Little Liars,WMD coming for that Prime video teenage girl audience hard
Pretty Little Liars,looks a lot like Riverdale
Pretty Little Liars,So glad they cancelled Raised by Wolves.
Pretty Little Liars,[removed]
Pretty Little Liars,"I like the idea, I just don't like the showrunner. I mean, no way the same showrunner as Riverdale can do a good show lol"
Pretty Little Liars,"Gonna be hilarious, can't wait!"
Pretty Little Liars,I’ll give it a fair shot. Maybe the creator getting all his other pilots and shows canceled has inspired him creatively. And as a plus the time slot lead out won’t be the 800 Club or whatever that ABC Fam nonsense was
Pretty Little Liars,"I mixed this up with *Big Little Lies* and got so fucking confused.

That said, it's not exactly an HBO kind of show."
Pretty Little Liars,"""This show looks terrible, i can't believe i'm going to watch this"" - me, a 32 year old male"
Pretty Little Liars,[deleted]
Pretty Little Liars,"""this isn't for me, therefore it sucks"""
Pretty Little Liars,Well…that’s one way to get the ladies at school to notice you lol
Pretty Little Liars,"They were books first lol, that’s probably how he knew. In fact, having only watcfed half of one season, I can guess what the spoiler probably was cuz the A reveal is in the books but the show changed it or something (a lot of people in my high school were into it)"
Pretty Little Liars,Which A was that? Off the top of my head there were like 3 major ones.
Pretty Little Liars,"Bailing the original after about season #4 was the right call, FWIW."
Pretty Little Liars,"I quit at season 4 too, and it was the first show I ever quit. haha it released me from the shackles of being a completionist. I'm definitely gonna watch this one though."
Pretty Little Liars,"Warner Bros TV were always the kings of the YA female crowd. It is just that now they might be putting some of those shows on HBO Max. 

Amazon is definitely trying to push into the market. Not that it seems to be going well for them with Panic and I Know What You Did Last Summer already cancelled and no word about a third season of The Wilds or Alex Rider. Even The Summer I Turned Pretty is not generating much buzz despite being renewed in advance for a second season. Next up targeting the YA female crowd is Paper Girls!"
Pretty Little Liars,"You mean, Netflix audience right lol"
Pretty Little Liars,Same showrunner
Pretty Little Liars,"How is Big Little Lies? I've read the book, and don't know if it's going to make me upset, i.e. be nothing like the book."
Pretty Little Liars,I'm a straight male and I already know I'll be watching this with my fiance lmao
Pretty Little Liars,Its different than the books.
Pretty Little Liars,"Summer I Turned Pretty not generating enough buzz? it is the most talked about show on TikTok and just recently hit #1 on prime, even Lizzo did a whole thing on there where she binged it, it’s a summer hit"
Pretty Little Liars,"IIRC, the first season was pretty good."
Pretty Little Liars,"First season was amazing, some of the best editing and cinematography ever seen in a TV show. The second season holds up well, still a very good season of TV, but not quite as mind-blowing."
Pretty Little Liars,"I did a rewatch of the original PLL show about a year ago, and my husband absolutely got sucked in and needed to know who A was"
Pretty Little Liars,Not the first A reveal
Pretty Little Liars,it most likely was the second A reveal then. i was only a kid back then but i remember how big the hype was
Pretty Little Liars,I’m already looking forward to a handful of youtube channels that will surely have something to say about after it comes out. The Gossip Girl reboot video essays were hilarious enough!
Pretty Little Liars,Ten more seasons of everyone in town taking a turn being A 💀
Pretty Little Liars,I always confuse this with Big Little Lies
Pretty Little Liars,"Hopefully this will be better than the Gossip Girl reboot. Also, this being on HBO Max, will A be a killer?"
Pretty Little Liars,Is this a reboot that basically starts over or a continuation?
Pretty Little Liars,"The creator of this new Pretty Little Liars series is the same guy who created Riverdale, the most insane show to ever hit Television (that's not an exaggeration). Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa should not have been handed a property as massive as Pretty Little Liars, even *if* the original was quite a bad show (if you don't believe me, check out YouTuber Friendly Space Ninja's video on it). RAS is going to fuck-up this new iteration of the show so hard."
Pretty Little Liars,Do you know Friendly Space Ninja?
Pretty Little Liars,I didn't realize that until you mentioned it. Totally was thinking it was that show
Pretty Little Liars,"It’s been described as “new town, but set in the same universe”. So, much like the Gossip Girl reboot, they’ll probably mention “the same thing happened in Rosewood, Pennsylvania” and maybe throw a couple of minor characters from the original show. It’s being made by the guy that made Riverdale and the PLL creator was angry that it was being made without her involvement, so I doubt any key characters will be involved."
Pretty Little Liars,I think I read an interview about getting original cast members to have cameos so probably more of a reboot with very minor references. That’s just my guess.
Pretty Little Liars,"One of my favorites. He practically took down Emily in Paris, didn’t he? And his Gossip Girl 2022 review was hilarious. 😂"
Pretty Little Liars,"yup, and both HBO..."
Pretty Little Liars,With the Riverdale guy I wonder if they’ll have magic involved. Ravenswood was in the same universe and they had magic and reincarnation and all kinds of weird shit. But it was never really mentioned in proper PLL.
Pretty Little Liars,"Ugh, Riverdale and Sabrina were rock bottom and the PLL franchise doesn't have much room to lower the bar."
Pretty Little Liars,"Oh the Riverdale guy can do mysteries a bit better than Marlene. Also he dosen't approve of adult/underage kids relationships.

Either way this will be hilarious! Gotta grab some wine!"
Pretty Little Liars,Dude you should watch his Riverdale video. It's one of my favorite pieces of critical media I've ever watched.
Pretty Little Liars,Her and every other person we've seen on the screen
Pretty Little Liars,"Y’all should see romance Korean dramas. 


They blur the actors skin to the point that you would think it’s a 360p YouTube video.

I watched a Netflix show called My Name and I thought the detective was a good actor. I googled him and he had another show airing at the same time called Yumis Cells. I burst out laughing in the first episode when you see how much makeup and after effects they put on his face."
Pretty Little Liars,Pink Gel Fluorescents like Jenna Maloney uses.
Pretty Little Liars,"This has real ""supermodel tells Vogue she was super-nerdy in middle school"" energy."
Pretty Little Liars,news at 11
Pretty Little Liars,"I am shocked. Shocked! Well, not that shocked."
Pretty Little Liars,i feel bad for Lucy for going through that. i grew up having terrible acne so i know how bad & insecure i felt dealing with that for all those years.   i know having acne is not THE most horrible thing a person can have happen to them and i know so many people in the world have things infinitely worse than i did with my acne but being a young teenager with bad acne (and the teasing that often accompanies having acne from classmates) is still pretty traumatizing/upsetting.
Pretty Little Liars,Don’t care if she has or had acne. She is so fine.
Pretty Little Liars,"Yea that’s what lighting is for usually, Lucy"
Pretty Little Liars,She didn’t even get past the first word of the title.
Pretty Little Liars,Doesn’t matter. She’s absolutely breathtaking either way
Pretty Little Liars,"why is this a bad thing? no one wants to see acne. if i could have special lighting follow me around, i’d do it too."
Pretty Little Liars,[deleted]
Pretty Little Liars,Well done.
Pretty Little Liars,Now I'm curious to see photos or videos that don't hide her acne.
Pretty Little Liars,"The actress in the recent Texas Chainsaw Massacre movie was also in the movie Eighth Grade. In the former, they tried to cover it up but I guess the budget wasn't high enough for Lucy Hale lighting, so you can still see her acne. In Eighth Grade, they didn't hide it to make the character realistic.

It's really kind of amazing what Hollywood makeup and lighting magic can do to make people look great."
Pretty Little Liars,Just slap some more makeup on top of your pores.
Pretty Little Liars,"I always noticed it with Supergirl on The CW. Everyone would look fairly normal, but Cat Grant (Calista Flockhart) always had this really intense bloom filter applied and it was pretty damn stark"
Pretty Little Liars,[The female lead's face in this Netflix trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJpPCkFHitM)
Pretty Little Liars,I loved her in The Rurra Jurra!
Pretty Little Liars,"Life was so hard, I wasn’t allowed to have Louboutins until I was 18."
Pretty Little Liars,Next you'll tell me they use makeup too
Pretty Little Liars,"agreed, but having seen her story posts of like “acne on fleek” when she has one red mark pimple on her forehead…those feel tone deaf. it makes me question her definition of acne, because that’s definitely not cystic acne at. all. but then again, maybe that’s post skincare"
Pretty Little Liars,You absolutely CAN change the lighting on set. That’s why there’s an entire team of people doing that….
Pretty Little Liars,"PLL was also shot with ~2010 era digital cameras and mastered in 1080p, I’m sure the new Texas Chainsaw movie had much more detail in each frame"
Pretty Little Liars,"I've only seen bits of that show, but there was so much soft focus on Calista's character you would swear she was dead and the lead was imagining her as a ghost."
Pretty Little Liars,god that was distracting
My Little Monster,Bronys have really put a “stank” on the MLP brand.
My Little Monster,"Can only speak for myself of course but, I only knew about the show and the “brony” sphere from youtube videos, I didn’t even know what network the show was on and never saw any ads, even though I was still pretty frequently watching cartoon network, nick, disney, and a channel surfer when bored. I was 14F when it came out. 

I will also say that the shows you mentioned, while not my favs, are all very original ideas. My little pony is a show that was based on a thirty yr marketing scheme of toys and such."
My Little Monster,"My daughter loved it. She watched all the episodes, all the movies including the ones where they become “human”… and I always thought it was a solid show. 

My wife came home and found me actually paying attention to the show and I was like, “honestly, it’s far better than most of the other kid’s content out there and this is legit entertaining in its own right”."
My Little Monster,"The Bronys didn’t help, I can show off Adventure Time and Gravity Falls and Steven Universe shit and not feel weird, but if I were to wear anything Pony related I’d be concerned people would confuse me for a Brony.

But I think it was also just too cutthroat. They kicked Lauren Faust out early seemingly because she wanted to to be a show first and a toy commercial second. And then they did those godawful human version of all the ponies going to a high school movies that really screamed “none of this matter, all the rules will change whenever we think we can sell you more toys because of it.”"
My Little Monster,"I'm not saying furries and MLP are linked, but both are loved and hated in much the same way."
My Little Monster,"Jenny Nicholson released a superb deep dive [report](https://youtu.be/4fVOF2PiHnc) on FiM and the subculture impact on YouTube.

You might want to have a look."
My Little Monster,"It is very difficult to assess the ""impact"" of any show without a concerted effort to either interview and collect data from fans (and in your question, non-fans). This usually requires some level of academic research and funding interesting, which MLP:FIM never really got to the level of say, ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"".

However, we do see some cultural critics pointing to the idea that MLP:FIM, while driven by commercial interest (selling toys) targeted at girls was able to expand to a dual audience (men) through more hard fantasy and even hard sci-fi plot lines.

Contrast this to, say, The Powerpuff Girls which used similar ideas, but still had a primarily male audience, and did not achieve MLP:FIM's dual audience success.

The most obvious outcome of the success of MLP:FIM is DC Super Hero Girls which follows the MLP:FIM archetype, again, attempting for a dual audience.

But overall, MLP:FIM I would say is part of a trend (or maybe started the trend? Reinforced the trend?) of ""girls programming"" that treats its audience more seriously, more maturely and appeals to both boys and girls. Other examples of this are Miraculous (super hero theming) and even Barbie: Life in the Dream House (essentially a parody of Barbie which seems to inform the upcoming Barbie Movie.)

How much of this came from MLP:FIM and how much was just MLP:FIM being part of a trend? Hard to say. But if you look at the timeline, MLP:FIM preceded many of the other examples I cite here.

My Little Monster,Never heard of it.
My Little Monster,The what now?
My Little Monster,"The biggest impact in my opinion was the absolute vilification of men enjoying children's targeted shows. The brony community became more famous than the show.  MLP only achieved popularity with girls aged 4-12...and men. Boys around that age hated the show and it just never achieved popularity with women. 

For the non animation community, it was jarring to see men express fawning interest of a young girls show on the local news. I remember being shocked to see the segment because it mentioned 4chan and at that time 4 chan was still kinda underground.

For the animation community, the brony subset were treated like pariahs because their fandom was out of control. Subset members were never able to completely shirk off the now public pedophilic association. Not to mention as the brony community became more mainstream, explicit MLP context exploded.  Look up 2010s YouTube as bronies were the butt of pedophilia jokes. It was that bad. 

The show's inability to gain dual gender viewership and the ever growing negative connotation of bronies publicly ruined whatever impact it could have had within the animation community.  I forgot to mention that MLP never could secure an overlap with another fandom to help its adult fans. You mentioned steven universe, adventure time,and gravity falls. All of those shows have overlapping fans. All of those shows appeal to multiple genders. The 2010s we're heavy in overlapping fandoms. Remember the Tumblr days of Superwholock? I can't name any shows that I would put in the same category of MLP due to its fan base."
My Little Monster,"Honestly I just don’t get the appeal. I’ve watched a few episodes. It’s mediocre. To me it’s identical to anything else that came out around then with young women as the targeted demographic. It’s a bright goofy show about toys, to get children to ask their parents for toys. I mean that’s okay, that’s what most kid shows are. I just don’t understand why this particular show sucked up so many adult men. It’s strange. And there’s something to it that we just haven’t quite cracked yet. A common assumption is they’re pedophiles, I don’t think that’s quite the case. Others say it appeals to people with autism, there’s evidence to back it up, but that seems more like correlation than causation. Ive also heard people say it’s a joke but I don’t believe people are spending thousands of dollars on conventions and plane tickets as a joke. I feel like there’s something else about it that made it take off so hard. Something that separated it from the Barbie shows or the bratz movies, despite the fact that they’re essentially identical. (From the perspective of a non fan) 

The impact is has made for me personally is that it is an enigma. It’s like if one day adults just started losing their shit for coco melon. It makes no sense to me, but I’m pretty fascinated by the whole situation. I don’t care that people are bronies but I personally don’t want to hang out with them. I like plenty of shows for kids. Adventure time, regular show, spongebob, drake and josh, Jake long, etc. and I know my friends watch them too. However, I’m not going to drake and josh con. I’m not buying over the garden wall jackets for 80 dollars from hot topic. I’m not going to wear a hat like finn’s to school everyday. It’s strange to make a children’s show your entire identity. No it’s not a crime, but it’s weird. I feel like the bronies know it’s weird, that’s part of why they do it. I’m not trying to be a jerk but most people will always see it as weird. Bronies made sure of that. 

Also my niece used to talk about it constantly and she says they ruined the show when they made the main character a unicorn."
My Little Monster,The cartoon was not watchable
My Little Monster,"MLP along with Adventure time essentially laid the groundwork for 2010s animation, MLP was without a doubt the biggest cartoon of its time from 2011-2015, but it did fade in popularity after that but retained a dedicated and active fanbase. 

Also the term cultural impact makes me roll my eyes after the Avatar discussions lately.

  
Like one simply needed to walk around a mall in 2014 to see how massive MLP was, with all audiences."
My Little Monster,"I'm a brony so my answered is a bit skewed but.
I think it really paved the way for kids shows enjoyed by adults. Yeah there where some before, but this one was in the unique position of coming out 2010s.
The early 2010s where weird, the internet was growing, internet culture was growing aswellm but also was it getting easier to watchs. The first 3 seasons of mlp you could find the episodes in full uploaded to YouTube, just there. It wasn't hard to find them. Before that you had to look at shady sites where you downloaded the show. Alot of people wouldn't do that."
My Little Monster,"It ruined its own impact by being ruined forever once Lauren Faust left. And G5 is the worst show of all time and is humiliatingly grasping onto relevance by constantly making shitty references to G4, but nobody cares. I don’t see it lasting beyond Netflix’s original order. After that MLP cartoons are *dead*. It’d be remembered so fondly if they hadn’t fucked everything up!"
My Little Monster,"I mean the name itself implies that it's targeted for kids and girls at that. Soo the immediate impression is always going to be, dudes a creep."
My Little Monster,"Nah, few bad apples, but the stank came from insecure men calling bronies pedophiles, homosexual slurs and the like, maybe you don't remember well, but the way the average person treated a brony after say...2012 when bronies weren't everywhere is the kind of bigotry that gets people cancelled like nothing today, it was simply a more toxic time."
My Little Monster,"A show which celebrates friendship, how overcoming differences/conflicts can deepen friendships, and how friendship and social support can help one get through stressful times. I’m definitely ok with my kids watching it."
My Little Monster,Yea.  Had a daughter in the target demographic at the time it was on.  Watched a lot of kids content during that time and it stood out with having a decent story.  Been a long time now so can’t really say what was unique about it and have no desire to rewatch but it was a good show for what it was.
My Little Monster,I was 50+ when my daughter was deeeeep intonthe whole MLP world and thoroughly enjoyed the Equestria Girls movies.
My Little Monster,"So...many...bodypillows...

It was an uncomfortable but still interesting watch."
My Little Monster,"I have to say, this is a very will thought out answer."
My Little Monster,"I heard about it and didn't really understand what a Brony was at the time, but I knew of Adventure Time and similar shows, thought it would fall into that category of cartoon based on reviews people were throwing out at the time. It took me about 2 episodes to realize it was literally just... A show about ponies for kids.

Also when the core audience is a split of children and adults on 4chan... Nothing good is gonna come of that."
My Little Monster,"> Like one simply needed to walk around a mall in 2014 to see how massive MLP was, with all audiences.

Unlike other kids shows at the time, MLP’s market was (after a bit of time) and adult demographic that was full of die-hard fans that could 1.) Afford merch, and 2.) Wanted every piece of merch they could get.

Just because something is prevalent in stores doesn’t mean it’s “culturally relevant.” By all means, most people had no interest in show simply because of the culture surrounding it.

I myself stand to think that the show is probably a good one and is probably (maybe?) Adventure Time-esque in quality, but I have literally 0 interest in watching it because of the stigma. I think that at the end of the day, this was the zeitgeist the show had (and even if people were unaware of Brony culture, they likely associated it as an overly cutesy show for little girls) and thus it wasn’t really in a position to gain ground."
My Little Monster,"The show peaked in ratings during season 4, and had the biggest fan events during season 5, so clearly ditching Lauren didn't damage the brand that much"
My Little Monster,"Uh I think 90% of the stank and mistreatment probably came from the fact that the ponies (including young looking ponies) got sexualized by weird people and those perverts took up more and more space in the fandom until they scared off the rest of the normal fans and kids, so it became a self perpetuating problem"
My Little Monster,"I love all the downvotes, indicator that people will resort to negative dismissal instead of just admitting that they were probably the asshole 10 years ago buying into misconceptions or misinformation and generalized a group of people based on nothing but a show they liked and what a few people who also liked that show did."
My Little Monster,a few bad apples spoils the whole batch.
My Little Monster,"This is ultimately why I hate discussions around cultural impact, its nigh impossible to find an objective to the goalposts can constantly be moved.

Look at Avatar (Cameron), people say it has no cultural impact due to reasons such as, no memes, lack of internet activity and discussions regarding it, and lack of popular common merchandise

MLP: FIM comparatively has, millions upon millions of memes, tons of internet activity and discussions even now (albeit massively less than when the show was still airing and in it's peak) and tons of merchandise for all ages from toys to clothes to school supplies. 

A massive youtube scene both official and fan wise, with fanmade song ""Discord"" having 65 million views and tons others reaching to 10M and beyond, fan animations such as Snowdrop having 20 million views or Lullaby for a princess with 51 million views. On the official content ""Welcome to the show"" from the second Equestria Girls movie has 338 MILLION views for its oldest upload, with another upload having 138M views  
and of course tons of other official content reaches into 10s of millions of views even into the later seasons

Surges of conventions with the most prominent reaching double digit attendance a few times for such a specific niche show.

So where is the line of it having no real impact besides popular merch, popular on the internet, popular with fan content and official content, and being the talk of the internet for both good and bad for nearly a decade?"
My Little Monster,Yes it did.
My Little Monster,"As someone who was actually in the Fandom
No, not really
Obviously there was a porn problem, but it was aboalutelt not a majority or even discussed in any of the sites or circles I used, maybe on 4chan it was

Seems more like people just grasped onto it as a reason to demean others

Look how much Pokémon or Animal Crossing porn there is...or actually don't. But it's there, and yet they are considered demented perverts"
My Little Monster,"...is a fundamentally problematic saying when you're talking about individual human beings.

Calling people, Mainly teens and young adults slurs and telling them to off themselves isn't suddenly justified because you heard some of them were drawing porn or that you personally thought they were weird.

You as in general people, not you specifically"
My Little Monster,"“Cultural impact” isn’t always positive. I don’t think that the show was ultimately viewed as anything more than a kinda awkward thing that only the fanbase wanted anything to do with.

I suppose it entered into the cultural Zeitgeist sure, but at the end of the day, it was a relatively niche thing tied to a weird corner of the internet that a lot of people wanted nothing to do with."
My Little Monster,"Adult male MLP fans literally all had autism. This is not me using autism as an insult, I unironically believe if they academically studied it they would struggle to find non-autistic adult male MLP fans.

MLP was an incredibly appealing world for autistic people, because the key theme was friendship and the messages near universally was “if you are nice to people, they will be your friend, and if they aren’t your friend after you are nice to them then something is wrong with them, not you”. This isn’t true, you can be nice and still be an incredibly annoying, or even repulsive person to be around, but autistic people have huge trouble understanding **why** people might not like them, so MLP was perfect escape fantasy in the same way Scott Pilgrim or Fight Club might be for other people.

The stink was because it was a community of almost exclusively autistic men, and pretty much identical to 4chan if 4chan decided being nice was better than being a meanie. Oh yeah and it literally started on 4chan."
My Little Monster,"Maybe, but within the broader ""niche"" of western animation, it still is among the top, search trends while not infallible or even super reliable show MLP with a steep lead over the 2nd biggest of the 2010s, which was adventure time in the U.S. As for Worldwide it is much closer with MLP still in the lead and AT close behind (both of which far beyond the other options.

That extends to today where its avg interest is still higher than these other shows (AT, Steven Universe, Gravity falls, etc) all ended for years now"
My Little Monster,"This is arguably one of the most ridiculous things I have ever read, and is peak redditor (since we are generalizing here) thinking they have anything near the ability to diagnose MILLIONS of people based on a show that they had a shared interest in. You do realize that many many many people liked MLP not because and absolutely not solely because of the theme of friendship right? A lot of people liked it for the same reason adults to this day enjoy Disneys animated films, because they are lighthearted simple escapism in an enjoyable universe with engaging although no overly complex characters and stories.

It is really that simple, but instead of simple acceptance you reach into this insane idea that It attracts exclusively autistic adult audience for these reasons you made up, reasons that aren't even true which is the funniest part.

MLP even at the simplest point of its storytelling (the first season) never once said that as long as you are nice everyone will be your friend and ABSOLUTELY never went with the ""if they are not, it's with them, not you"" that is just made up drivel.  


I liked MLP for the same reason I enjoyed Gravity Falls, or Owl House, or Steven Universe for a time, because I thought it was a well made animated show, and I love the medium of animation."
My Little Monster,Are you autistic?
My Little Monster,"No, fantastic response though."
My Little Monster,"Your posts are all about video games, hypothetical matchups between 40k characters and superheroes, and you haven’t noticed that the Brony fandom is extremely autistic, so I’m going to go out on a limb and guess that either that’s a lie or your mum just never got you tested."
My Little Monster,"You felt the need to check my profile and want to diagnose me with some kind of mental illness? 

Reddit is an extension of my free time,specifically the free time I spend inside and not going out with my friends or family.  I like spending that free time with video games, films, tv shows, books and yeah vs matchups are fun lil comparisons to make between characters. It's silly but fun, in the same way any entertainment is.

Seriously you think you are clever? You are an ableist piece of shit trying to pretend you aren't using autism as an insult while using negative connotations to then accuse me and others of being autistic.

I didn't ""notice"" the brony fandom is extremely autistic because I actually knew a bunch of them, not got my information from cringe compilations like you seem to have. Some definitely seem to be autistic of the ones I meant, or display some other kind of developmental disorder, but the majority I met were just...young adults who seemed perfectly devoid of anything.

Look inward, you're an asshole."
My Little Monster,"Fresh Prince and its not the ""Why He Dont Want Me Man"" scene

its actually a performance from Alfonso Ribiero after Will is shot and Carlton is ready to go get revenge. [This scene](https://youtu.be/rJ31eBipr_g) and the weight of it always stuck with me.

a shame to be typecast because Alfonso is an incredible actor"
My Little Monster,The episode of Roseanne where Jackie’s boyfriend is discovered to be physically abusing her.
My Little Monster,Ted Lasso telling the story of his dads suicide
My Little Monster,"Rob McElhenney as Mac in “Mac finds his Pride”. 

THe character started as a womanizer, before eventually coming out of the closet after about 12 seasons. In the episode I’m talking about, he decides to tell his imprisoned father that he is gay, by doing an interpretive dance for the whole prison, as well as Danny Devito’s character. 

Anyone familiar with the show might be waiting for the joke, but there isn’t one. He and his partner do a five minute uninterrupted dance, in water, representing the storm swirling inside the character, as a catholic man coming to terms with his sexuality. It’s really beautiful and powerful. 

Iirc Rob spent the better part of a year training and practicing for it. It’s pretty surprising coming from a show with an episode called “who pooped the bed”.

My Little Monster,the parts of the office that show Michael’s more honest or serious sides are part of what makes it special in my opinion. steve carrell was excellent at making this annoying buffoon sympathetic at times. he was actually an empathetic and kind person at heart lol
My Little Monster,"Fun fact about the Fresh Prince, that scene was based in reality. Will Smith never met his father, and the line above was unscripted, as was the hug with his uncle.

Lmao nope, Will Smith knows his parents and has a tumultuous relationship with a father that very much raised him. The story above is posted fucking *everywhere* online though, despite being patently false and racially stereotypically. Gotta love the internet."

My Little Monster,Ricky Gervais is a really good actor. His monologue at the end of Extras is amazing.
My Little Monster,I love how you corrected yourself.  You were all coming for yourself in your own comment.
My Little Monster,Blackadder Goes Forth is the gold standard for this
My Little Monster,"Yeah. He just walked out of the room when he heard about it. Came back with a sore hand and bruised knuckles.  Cops picked him up and on the way to the station they stop at a light and he looks over and sees his kid's school principal who he had to meet with earlier to discuss the kid's bad behavior at school.  He smiles at him and waves with the handcuffs on lol.  

One of my favorite scenes that takes place while the credits are rolling"
My Little Monster,No? I've known the Smith thing since I was a teenager.
My Little Monster,now book a therapist for sessions and start watching Neon Genesis Evangelion.
My Little Monster,Now go watch Monster.
My Little Monster,"If you’re into philosophy/politics or want to watch the best space opera, then watch Legend of the galactic heroes (not the remake, the new one sucks)"
My Little Monster,AOT was also my first anime ☺️
My Little Monster,"If you're enjoying Vinland Saga, you should check out the author's other work, Planetes. It's about a crew of astronauts picking up space debris in a future where spaceflight is still fairly new and not exactly high science fiction, but also advanced enough where orbital debris has become a serious concern. Like Vinland Saga, it's very character focused and follows a ragtag group hanging on the bottom rung of the corporate ladder.

+1 on Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood, as well. It's faster paced, and action oriented, but like Vinland Saga, the best part of it lies in the characters and their journey. Personally I like at how adeptly the author manages to keep the main characters and side characters moving in separate circles throughout the story and unwinding different parts of a greater mystery on their own.

If you like AoT, I might suggest Gundam as well, though that can be a very long road to go down since it's such a long-running franchise. I would suggest Gundam: Thunderbolt to experiment with, since despite being part of a larger canon, it's short and self-contained story about two soldiers on the opposite sides of a nearly-finished war, fighting over the remnants of a destroyed space colony."
My Little Monster,how anime/manga depicts feelings in the most earnest ways is one of the reasons why I've been loving them for 30 years. When I read Video Girl Ai at 17 it nearly destroyed me
My Little Monster,"I'll never understand how something mid like AoT gets such a passionate fanbase.  
If you want something truly amazing try FMA: brotherhood."
My Little Monster,I've felt that way too. Then I think of shows like Fairy Tail exist and I remember all other anime has been drained of artistic value by association.
My Little Monster,"I want to watch ""MONSTER"" for a long time. but +60 series is a lot for me 😮"
My Little Monster,"Wow, I love Planetes and not a big anime guy. So I'll probably try and watch Vinland now.

I will also recommend Wings of Honnemaise (sp?) for a movie if you enjoy Planetes."
My Little Monster,"Love Vinland Saga and decided to give Planetes a try and very much enjoyed the first episode. Being a sci-fi nerd and a lover of good animation i think i'm gona enjoy this one.

+1 on Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood. Great show."
My Little Monster,"+1000 for Fullmetal. It's an annual re-watch for me. AoT is a bimonthly re-watch for me. Yep, I just like it that much, lol.

I tried to get into the Gundam franchise but instead of starting out with the mainline series, I watched Iron Blooded Orphans first and it was fucking awesome. I couldn't really get into the other series though but IBO was fantastic."
My Little Monster,"Great suggestions, thank you! I hadn’t heard of Planetes and that description sounds like something I’d enjoy a lot, thanks for that one especially, if it has a similar standard of writing to Vinland I’ll be very pleased."
My Little Monster,"AoT does have its flaws, especially when it comes to character writing; I think Eren’s development is terrific and while I thought he was a bit boring at first, his character goes places I never even thought of. I would have liked to see more from Mikasa and Armin though, especially Mikasa. The rest of the Scout Regiment can be kind of one note, but Jean had good development though and Reiner became one of my favorite characters in the show once you learn about his conflicting loyalties. I kind of forgive it though because the constant twists and set pieces are absolutely incredible; the basement reveal, the Shiganshina fight, about half of the episodes of season 4, etc. were all fantastic. I like how morally grey it all becomes and I think just because it was the first anime I sat down and really watched it hit different for me. 

I’ll definitely be checking out FMA: Brotherhood at some point, I know it’s really highly regarded."
My Little Monster,"I liked AOT more than Fma ( first 2004 ) 

AOT is the best"
My Little Monster,The first opening lives rent free in my mind
My Little Monster,Because they talk like you with phrasing such as 'If you really want something amazing..'
My Little Monster,Possibly the worst ending ever. By the end of it I was so grossed out by the nationalistic and facist themes and subtext of the story. The author is pro genocide with his reverence for mass murdering generals and sweeping all the atrocities of japan under the rug. If thats how he feels then keep it out of your art or it can't be separated.
My Little Monster,Watch both series and compare them lol. It's like comparing fine dining to McDonalds.
My Little Monster,"This is a problem with you not understanding the manga lol, not the manga itself."
My Little Monster,No its about Isayama´s incompetence. You can go [read up](https://www.polygon.com/2019/6/18/18683609/attack-on-titan-fascist-nationalist-isayama-hajime-manga-anime) on all the facist themes and subtext.
My Little Monster,"Lmao y’all are delusional. There are fascist themes in aot, but that doesn’t mean isayama is endorsing those themes. He’s showing how fascism arises and what situations lead to fascism. AoT fanbase is easily the worst anime fanbase lol"
My Little Monster,"He even apologised for the ending. Theres no need to defend it, not even the author himself is.

And Griffith is not a racist but that doesn´t erase the fact that he made Birth of a Nation which is a racist movie. He even followed it up with Tolerance but the damage was already done. Whether deliberate or plain incompetence thats whats being portrayed.

Isayama is super nationalistic, and denies korean genocide. Even names one of the good guys after generals responsible for these atrocities and crimes against humanities. Says thats his hero. Imagine naming the mentor in your story after Goebbels and honor that character."
My Little Monster,"He did not apologize for the ending lol. And again, portraying fascism does not mean you support fascism. What a dumb comment lol"
My Little Monster,"Yes he [did](https://www.dexerto.com/anime/attack-on-titan-creator-apologizes-for-controversial-ending-im-really-sorry-2001344/). If you don´t have any arguments to defend it, then why even comment?"
My Little Monster,Him saying sorry has nothing to do with fascism lol. He’s saying sorry bc he knows some fans will be upset.
My Little Monster,"Its not about whether you portray facism or not, its *how* you portray it.

He´s sorry because he´s not sure he did it right. Its literally in the link but you couldn´t even bother to read it. This pointless, have a good one."
My Little Monster,"There’s literally nothing in the link that says he portrayed fascism the wrong way lol. Please quote me where he said that.

And he portrays it just fine, only the illiterate think he’s supporting fascism lol"
My Little Monster,"TV was cheaper, they had less time to prep, they pumped out 20+ episodes a year. It was more disposable and less lucrative for the actors. All that means it's going to be viewed as lesser."
My Little Monster,[deleted]
My Little Monster,"I’m not going to read all that, but the primary reason tv work once hindered an actor’s ability to work in movies is that tv requires the actor working specifically on that job for 8-9 months. That’s still the case for regulars in these high budget fantasy shows. It’s kind of hard to get into movies when you’ve got 2-3 months available to shoot and films take anywhere between 2-6 months to shoot on average."
My Little Monster,"I’m not going to read your whole post, because you wrote an essay instead of asking a question, but here you go:

Tom Hanks was a television star, even though the show he had a lead role in only lasted two seasons.

Bruce Willis was a massive television star.

Michael J. Fox was a television star.

There were a bunch of television stars who made the jump to movies because when movies were star driven, the money in movies was much better.

The people who stayed in television had no movie star power, which back then was defined by the ability to get people in the theatre in the first extended weekend.

So the answer is simple, many television stars became movie stars, and did not go back to television because back then, movies paid better."
My Little Monster,"As a rule, the US didn't just treat TV acting as lesser, but the whole medium of television. It's kind of what Newton T. Minow was getting at with *Television and the Public Interest*; he had the belief that television had the *potential* to be brilliant, but that it was rarely exercised in the US, particularly after the death of the television play.

Meanwhile, as mentioned in one of the replies in your original post, in places with less commercial pressure, television could and often was treated with more seriousness and respect. For example, in the UK, the television play format persisted well into the 1980s, with some pretty big names involved such as Ken Loach, Dennis Potter, Nigel Kneale and Noël Coward, but US audiences of the time might have found a formula where they were adapting scripts by Jean-Paul Sartre to be a bit stuffy.

Further afield, other European countries gave a certain amount of credence to highbrow directing on television; Germany had Rainer Werner Fassbinder with *Berlin Alexanderplatz*, Poland had Krzysztof Kieślowski with *Dekalog* and Sweden had Ingmar Bergman with, among others, *Scenes from a Marriage* and *Fanny and Alexander*. As a result, I get the impression that there would have been less of a stigma around transitioning from television acting to the big screen.

I kind of feel that the perspective that *The Sopranos* invented quality television comes with a certain amount of cultural myopia when other countries were straight-up putting art cinema in a television form onto their screens, but it did have a big enough budget that it was hard to ignore. That said, one could assert that David Lynch was there first from a US perspective, transitioning from an already pretty notable cinematic directorial career into television."
My Little Monster,Times change.
My Little Monster,[deleted]
My Little Monster,"In the US. When you sign up for a show you sign up for 7 seasons of a show. Because the TV studios own you for this period of time, it can definitely effect the career of a rising star or a movie star would be reluctant to go back to being shackled to a such a long contract.

Michael J Fox is one such example, the producers wanted him but they couldn’t get him because he was contractually obligated to Family Ties. It wasn’t until later they could get him. 

Pierce Bronson was offered Dalton’s James Bond but also couldn’t take the role because he was on Remington Steele at the time.

Even with these limitations there are a plenty of people that went on the great success after being on TV back in the 80s. 

Will Smith is probably the biggest example of someone that got super star fame and awards. 

The difference you are seeing now is that an actor can go to television and back because the contracts of many cable or streaming series doesn’t require the massive 7 year contracts that are required of older network shows."
Sid the Science Kid,Mr. Wizard!
Sid the Science Kid,Bill Nye mainly because of the 90s song parodies. I went down the YouTube rabbit hole and watched a bunch of them a few years ago and even as an adult I think they’re amazing
Sid the Science Kid,"I'm going to have to go off the board and say Mr. Lizard. /s

https://youtu.be/MM1S27fPUQY

Actually, I'm old so it's Mr. Wizard (Don Herbert) for me."
Sid the Science Kid,"Beakman's world. Never cared for Bill Nye, even then I thought he was too arrogant. I loved Beakman's explanation of viruses and how antibodies work."
Sid the Science Kid,I grew up with the Mythbusters.
Sid the Science Kid,"I didn't have any of that new fangled stuff. I had:

1. National Geographic

2. How and Why Wonder books

3. Chemistry and electronics toy sets that are now all banned."
Sid the Science Kid,"Oddly enough, Bill Nye is less educated than Dolph Lungren."
Sid the Science Kid,Bill Nye
Sid the Science Kid,"Of the two, Beakman. But Mr. Wizard was the best."
Sid the Science Kid,This is the correct answer
Sid the Science Kid,Not even Mr wizard?
Sid the Science Kid,"I don't know why you're getting downvoted, you're absolutely correct"
Sid the Science Kid,"> Mr wizard

According to Wiki, I'm too young to have seen the broadcasts, and too old to see it on Nick, that's assuming I had access to cable, which I didn't until '85."
Sid the Science Kid,Yeah it's weird. People get mad rather than accept the truth sometimes.
Sid the Science Kid,Apparently that fun fact wasn't as fun to them as others.
Sid the Science Kid,Rocko's Modern Life had the main character work at a sex phone line. The sheer amount of adult humor they snuck in was absurd.
Sid the Science Kid,Johnny Bravo was pretty wild.
Sid the Science Kid,"*Animaniacs* felt like wall-to-wall grown-up jokes at times - not just dirty jokes (like the infamous >!“finger Prince”!< gag), but also lots of references to media and celebrities that adults would probably be most familiar with. One episode had a Martin Scorsese reference inside of a *West Side Story* reference inside of a *Goodfellas* reference, for example."
Sid the Science Kid,IIRC Rugrats hinted at the Grandpa being eager to get the kids to bed so he could watch porn.
Sid the Science Kid,"Arthur had a Deep Throat (Watergate, not the porno) joke that twenty years later I still think about. 

Who was that joke for? How many people under 40, let alone children, would have caught it when it first aired? It wasn't dirty but it was definitely a joke for the parents watching.

Edit: Arthur also did a Howard Dean yell at a pep rally. It turned people against him."
Sid the Science Kid,"Helga -- ""Arnold, you make my girlhood tremble""

Old school nickelodeon shows were a trip lol"
Sid the Science Kid,"What about Ren & Stimpy (I’m showing my age now) I loved that show growing up but how it actually made it to television, in Nickelodeon’s prime time, is baffling."
Sid the Science Kid,Bluey is pretty great.
Sid the Science Kid,"How is Chowder not here. A lot of jokes that flew right by kids’ heads, including Schnitzel’s “joke”

https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=g_mrSn3PGwM

Translation: “She wanted the finger, so I gave her the whole fist.”"
Sid the Science Kid,Probably Teen Titans Go. I'd wager most people who hate it have never actually watched it.
Sid the Science Kid,"spongebob and sandy did an awful lot of ""karate"" in those episodes. Adventure Time is also a great example with jake explaining finn the different ""tiers"" of a relationship."
Sid the Science Kid,"Maybe not the “best” but:
The Tick,   Cow & Chicken"
Sid the Science Kid,"Cow and chicken

“Oh doctor I would be happy to squirt for you!”"
Sid the Science Kid,"Lots of 90's Nickelodeon content fits this description, but two recent(-ish) examples that I really enjoyed were *Gravity Falls* and *Over the Garden Wall*."
Sid the Science Kid,"Rocky and Bulwinkle. And all the shows included. 

Bugs Bunny."
Sid the Science Kid,How about that Scooby Doo series that had a series long Twin Peaks reference
Sid the Science Kid,"Ren & Stimpy ( was that even a kids show? my kids got me into it ) had stuff that I've only found out recently is in highfalutin' philosophy stuff. Mainly, ""Stimpy's Invention"" hangs on the nail of Lacanian surplus enjoyment. But a lot of cartoons punch way above thier weight."
Sid the Science Kid,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2LZjMsT1cA
Sid the Science Kid,Peewee’s Playhouse. That’s why so many adults loved that show.
Sid the Science Kid,Regular Show easily
Sid the Science Kid,"""See you next Tuesday, Mrs. Puff!"""
Sid the Science Kid,Adventure Time!
Sid the Science Kid,Fairy Odd Parents in it's early years had plenty of adult jokes that went over my head (George Bush taking a trip to Escalator Land for example.) I'd almost say for that era of Nick it was up there with SpongeBob for shows that had jokes adults and kids can enjoy.
Sid the Science Kid,"Early 90s Nick cartoons had some absolutely wild stuff.  In hindsight it's crazy that my parents let me watch that but not the Simpsons, which was far more wholesome."
Sid the Science Kid,Spunky fucked a mop with sound effects indicating that he orgasmed!
Sid the Science Kid,"""Oh baby, oh baby, oh baby.""

And the phone sex line was in the very first episode."
Sid the Science Kid,You can’t forget the Chokey Chicken!
Sid the Science Kid,"Oh baby, oh baby, oh baby"
Sid the Science Kid,"Yes. This∆∆∆∆. The Good Pigeons , take on The Good Fellas"", Godfather. I felt like it was geared toward ppl who watched Warner Bros cartoons as kids."
Sid the Science Kid,I loved Animaniacs until my mom saw a Hello Nurse short and made me stop watching.
Sid the Science Kid,"There was a Pinky and the Brain with caricatures of Saul Bellow and Chi Chi Rodriguez. Because that's what kids like, writers and golfers..."
Sid the Science Kid,"Not just any porn, horny alien porn called Lonely Space Vixens."
Sid the Science Kid,"Arthur had a lot of quasi-adult humor sprinkled in. One episode had a South Park parody that even had a “they killed Kenny” joke. God, Arthur is *good.*"

Sid the Science Kid,"Vasectomy, hangovers, giving birth, Stumpfest. 

Should be number one."
Sid the Science Kid,"I don't hate, but I tried some episodes and didn't work for me...

But I love Gumball."
Sid the Science Kid,Wait… thats what Karate was? Oh nooo
Sid the Science Kid,Cow & Chicken was going to be my answer as well.
Sid the Science Kid,"While I love Over the Garden Wall, and it absolutely can be enjoyed by kids and adults alike, I can't really think of any 'adult' (as it's used in this context) jokes from it."
Sid the Science Kid,"Including of course Super Chicken - ""You knew the job was dangerous when you took it Fred"""
Sid the Science Kid,"When any religious idiots would criticize the Simpsons around me, I’d always point out that it was one of the few tv shows that actually showed the main characters attending church and featured the local reverend as a named, recurring character. 

That always dumbfounded them."
Sid the Science Kid,Sounds like the mop also got quite spunky.
Sid the Science Kid,SPUUUUUUUUUUNKY
Sid the Science Kid,Or Jackhammering jokes!
Sid the Science Kid,Just FYI they were the Goodfeathers.
Sid the Science Kid,Considering they animated Brain reciting the Orson Welles commerical breakdown nearly word for word...animaniacs had some strange ideas of 'for kids'.
Sid the Science Kid,"""Hey, you squished Buster! Hey come out!""

And then the evil aliens refuse to eat Arthur, because he's too high in cholesterol. 

""The earth is saved!"""
Sid the Science Kid,Deap Throat was identified in 2005. That might fit the timeline.
Sid the Science Kid,"Yeah, OtGW is a very child friendly show, which makes sense since the idea is to look at death through the lense of a child."
Sid the Science Kid,There is and episode where Homer stops going to church and is smited
Sid the Science Kid,And it doesn't insult their faith only their hypocrisy.
Sid the Science Kid,Beautiful username.
Sid the Science Kid,There ya go. Had the Godfather pigeon and all. And the one alpha that I swear was Jo Pesci
Sid the Science Kid,Thank you!  You're the first person to notice or mention the reference.
Sid the Science Kid,There’s also the Ray Liotta/Henry Hill pigeon who starts out every Goodfeathers short with an “As far back as I can remember…” voiceover.
Sid the Science Kid,Oh damn yes I remember that now. Shiit was epic
Sid the Science Kid,This is from Season 3 Episode 4 for anybody curious.

Sid the Science Kid,Chop chop!
Sid the Science Kid,Chop chop!
Sid the Science Kid,This show stinks of thinking about Tony.
Sid the Science Kid,"My favorite sketch is the one they did in a subsequent episode. An older man with a grinding wheel is walking down a suburban neighborhood. It’s a nice Fall day. Dave as the axe murderer stops him and chats about life in general as the latest axe murderer victim dies in the background. 

Very low key sketch in many respects"
Sid the Science Kid,30 Helens agree.
Sid the Science Kid,Where is he? What is he doing?
Sid the Science Kid,It's a fact!
Sid the Science Kid,What is he thinking? Is he thinking of me? Will he ever return one day?
Sid the Science Kid,"Because of a law passed by the US putting [regulations on children's TV shows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulations_on_children%27s_television_programming_in_the_United_States) during the 90s.  The real effect of this wasn't quite a thing until the late 90s and got solidified shortly after in the early 2000s as all the broadcasters were on board and business models had changed.

Basically, children's TV was a free for all of all types, local, national, acquired overseas content, lvie action, cartoons, just bonkers and go crazy with it.

This lead to tons of kids programming on broadcast since it did pretty well, especially in certain hours, like before school and saturday morning.  Animation became the go to here, for lots of reasons, but they aren't important.

So while the 80s and 90s were absolutely filled with all types of childrens animated shows, some good, bad, for younger kids, or teens, experimental or classic -- lots of options and the ratings were good so things were good, keep watching! Its doing great, we can take chances, and we can invest in this.

But then in the mid-late 90s a law passed earlier was more cracked down on-- it forces broadcast networks to make a certain amount of 'Educational & Informative' (called E/I) content, airing roughly 1-2 hours per day.

So this content can be anything, but it was mandatory conent, and most cartoons and stuff didn't meet its needs. Instead you'd often just purchase some shit syndicated show (like some guy with animals, or an educational cartoon). And really the only place for this, was the same time as kids TV.

So you basically cut out a big chunk of kids TV every single day.

Lots more happened, but it gets technical and less ELI5... but suffice it to say, a lot of content in kids areas got pushed out or FAR more highly selective for the same time slots, and thus, the boom shifted away from kids animation on broadcast networks more to cable nets that could content with lower ratings and more niche content. Broadcast just didn't need to recompete to regain that audience, it wasn't worth it."
Sid the Science Kid,">What happened to high quality TV-Y7 cartoons that could be watched without cable?

They're still around, they just aren't being marketed to you."
Sid the Science Kid,Changes to laws in the late 90's made kids programming far less profitable.  In addition sports programs turned out to get just a good of ratings and are far cheaper to produce.
Sid the Science Kid,"On Saturday mornings we used to get up and watch the Saturday morning shows that were for kids, some of these shows went on into the afternoon especially in the 80s.

In fact, Saturday Telly was a big event for all in the 90s in the UK. The Saturday cartoon shows with live action studios would have adult themes running through them with 'wink, wink, nod, nod' bit of blue for the dads jokes running through them.

From 2pm onwards, it was likely you'd be outside playing with your mates, then back in to watch Baywatch, You Bet, Gladiators then bed. Dad's would be glued to the telly for the slow motion boobies, and mums didn't seem to mind because they had the Hoff to stare at. 

Now kids get up and it's straight to an online game, content on the internet and everyone in the family is largely doing the same. I'm not critical of this, times change, but that's why you don't have the kids shows of the 90s etc."
Sid the Science Kid,People seem to have missed also saying that channels also began popping up that were literally just cartoons. Most of those quality shows went there.
Sid the Science Kid,YouTube. Kids will still choose to watch shitty minecraft let's plays
Sid the Science Kid,"Simple answer: Kids prefer YouTube, Netflix, etc and nearly everyone has high-speed internet now. Cartoon Network, Nickelodeon, Disney, PBS, etc are all available on one streaming service or another and those are getting new shows all the time, but maybe not as often.

It's not as financially viable to air a show on TV these days, not like it used to be. The commercials that keep these shows on air are not getting the viewership they would if they just advertised online."
Sid the Science Kid,"There has never been more variety in children’s programming across streaming and cable and without the advertising inherent with broadcasting.

Broadcast were fighting a losing battle."
Sid the Science Kid,[deleted]
Sid the Science Kid,"You download Gargoyles, Swat Kats, and 2 Stupid Dogs. What more do you need?"
Sid the Science Kid,"There are other real reasons for this happening people laid out, but part of it is that...the prevalence of ""kids"" media in whatever forms are available is a generational trend that ebbs and flows. Not to say there wouldn't always be something kid-friendly, just how bigger picture trends shake out. 

90s parents were bigger on ""subversive"" entertainment where the appeal was pushing boundaries they'd realistically not want kids in on. But my parents would scoff at a fellow adult watching Pokemon with their kids. This era's been more about legit ""fun for the whole family"" content like Marvel, etc."
Sid the Science Kid,"In addition to the legal changes, it was a cost savings measure. Animated shows are expensive, live action educational shows like ""Jack Hanah"" and similar ""critter"" based shows were much cheaper to produce. There has also been a shift in entertainment consumption since the 90s. Young males, the target audience for many of these shows, are much more likely to be playing video games on a Saturday morning than watching TV or streaming."
Sid the Science Kid,Adult centered commercials paid more moneh
Sid the Science Kid,I've really only noticed educational cartoons for children that are younger than six or seven years old. Am I just missing the ones for older kids?
Sid the Science Kid,"It was also the end of the era in which most children watched their cartoons in Saturday morning, because broadcast television was becoming less of a big deal and there was always cartoons on one of the cable channels."
Sid the Science Kid,"One interesting thing is that Where in the World Is Carmen San Diego was part of the 90's push for educational content, but unfortunately it disappeared because the information given by the show would quickly get outdated. There are some episodes where they actually had to put up a disclaimer,"
Sid the Science Kid,So did a show like Hysteria fall under the E/I category since it was educational ?
Wild Kratts,"She served as an executive for Nickelodeon and Cartoon Network both, and both runs were during some of their best years. I have high faith in her selecting quality projects for kids."
Wild Kratts,"Man...I'm not saying it's a bad show but the wild kratts drive me up the fucking wall. They have access to multiple pieces of completely ground-breaking technology and make the DUMBEST GODDAMN DECISIONS with it. Like they were studying ~~grizzly~~  black bears and ~~one of them activates into a bear to get into a salmon-fishing competition with a real bear~~, they track two bears catching fish to see who gets more, and one of the brothers gets into a salmon-sized boat that looks JUST LIKE a fucking salmon and SWIMS INTO THE EXACT AREA WHERE REAL FUCKING BEARS ARE TRYING TO CATCH SALMON and QUELLE FUCKING SURPRISE, a bear catches this fucking miracle of technology and tries to EAT IT.

Sorry. I've been carrying that around for a while.

Edit: mis-remembered a few details. The point still stands."
Wild Kratts,Odd Squad is awesome.
Wild Kratts,Dinosaur Train sounds like a badass metal band
Wild Kratts,Grownnnnnn ups come back.
Wild Kratts,My 2 year old loves Daniel Tigers Neighborhood.... and I love getting the little reminders of Mr Rogers. So she’s a-ok in my book and I’m happy for her success.
Wild Kratts,Odd Squad FTW
Wild Kratts,"Dinosaur Train is pretty fun for my oldest, but I really like Wild Kratts and love Odd Squad. I just turned 36."
Wild Kratts,"If she's also responsible for Pinkalicious, my 3 year old may have single handedly secured the promotion for her."
Wild Kratts,"I had some friends shit on Daniel Tiger as ""it wasn't made by the Roger's estate"" a few years ago. So I assumed it was shit.

Flash forward to me having toddler and I am realizing it's the best show on TV to teach kids how to be a decent human being. (t also makes me realize the kind of behaviors I need to exhibit as a parent, too)

Just because a piece of media is made outside the legacy of a prominent figure doesn't mean it can't be amazing."
Wild Kratts,"My 3 year old loves all of those shows.

&#x200B;

I approve."
Wild Kratts,"Daniel Tiger is great. Wholesome, with lots of teaching moments for both kids and adults."
Wild Kratts,All my favorite shows
Wild Kratts,"Odd Squad is great, and Wild Kratts is good enough.  My kid likes them both, but even I, as an adult, somewhat enjoy OddSquad."
Wild Kratts,Odd Squad rules.
Wild Kratts,Good! She’s great! And give PBS funding too!
Wild Kratts,"PBS Kids is the only subscription service my family pays for. My boys enjoy all these shows. Actually, my wife and I do too.
 
Based on the shows listed and Linda’s overall track record, I’m looking forward to what’s coming next. It should be great."
Wild Kratts,Who made Paw Patrol? ...'cuz they need to be exorcised and sealed in a floating tomb of holy water
Wild Kratts,/r/danieltigerconspiracy
Wild Kratts,Good! We need moar Dinosaur Train things! My youngest who isn’t even born yet will give me an excuse to watch it again.
Wild Kratts,Molly of Denali is my jam
Wild Kratts,She knows what to do
Wild Kratts,I miss just old school Mr. Rogers
Wild Kratts,We did most of these with our son. I hope for all the best things for her:)
Wild Kratts,"Idk what odd squad is, but the rest are pretty good. Dinosaur Train is something I would want to dislike, but I’d stick up for it if some other show was bullying it."
Wild Kratts,My son and I have some good memorable times watching Wild kratts 🤙🏼🤙🏼🤙🏼
Wild Kratts,She deserves it! I have a 6 and 5 year old boys and they grew up on those shows! My wife and I ended up liking them as much or more as our boys
Wild Kratts,"My kids like most of the above shows, but for me, **Peg + Cat** is where it's at."
Wild Kratts,Congratulations Linda!
Wild Kratts,"The Kratt bothers are still around? Damn, I didn’t know they were still making shows. I still remember Kratt’s Creatures and Zaboomafoo."

Wild Kratts,"Lol, saw the thumbnail and I was like why is Weird Al associated with this?"
Wild Kratts,I was hoping that satan Caillou was not on her resume and am greatly relieved
Wild Kratts,Those are the four shows that my kids like.
Wild Kratts,bring back zoom
Wild Kratts,Dinosaur train. Dinosaur train.
Wild Kratts,"Basically all the best shows.  I’m not young anymore and I still think they’re all awesome.

....Now the dinosaur train song is stuck in my head.... damnit"
Wild Kratts,"Oh no, not Odd Squad."
Wild Kratts,"I watch all this shit all morning before getting the kids ready for school, and I love Nature Cat!"
Wild Kratts,"I watch dinosaur train after the kids go to sleep, no shame."
Wild Kratts,The first time I watched Dinosaur train like 9 years ago I was half asleep half dreaming with a screaming 3 month old in my arms and I thought I was hallucinating. My son and I still sit down to watch the time traveling dinosaurs because it’s something we shared and it’s completely bonkers. And the equally bonkers odd squad is one of the strangest funniest shows I’ve ever seen.
Wild Kratts,Of course the promote a woman since in todays world if you promote a man you are sexist and oppressing.
Wild Kratts,Hopefully she can bring it back to level of 90s PBS
Wild Kratts,"Why doesn't Daniel Tiger wear pants?  Or his dad.  Everyone else seems to wear pants, dresses, or skirts.  Daniel wears PJ pants and snow pants, but most of the time he's out there freeballing it.  Why?  This is a show that deals with serious issues like the potty and dealing with strangers.  Daniel should be wearing pants."
Wild Kratts,Wild Kratts depict predators as malicious animals. Total bullshit and misleading.  Daniel Tiger’s Neighborhood is mindless garbage.
Wild Kratts,"Look I know I'm biased because I'm an adult and I wasn't raised on any of those shows, but they all pail in comparison to their predecessors. Kids really have to settle for Daniel Tiger and Wild Kratts when we were getting Mr. Rogers and Zoboomafoo? Give them some good shows. Odd Squad is the only thing listed there that didn't make me roll my eyes and that's because I only know it by it's name."
Wild Kratts,Daniel Tiger would make a nice rug tbh.
Wild Kratts,If both my kids are indicators her track record is phenomenal
Wild Kratts,That's a lot more relevant to the new position than shows she's directed. Makes me more confident.
Wild Kratts,It makes me miss Zoboomafoo.  But I do love the Kratt Bros so we still watch Wild Kratts.
Wild Kratts,"I thought Wild Kratts was live action for a second so I was majorly confused until I looked it up... ohhh


https://youtu.be/Vqj-r83ywUc?t=1170"
Wild Kratts,LMAO so mad that the French came out
Wild Kratts,See you on the creature trail!
Wild Kratts,"I was about to be mad at first, and by th he end I was rolling. I can totally relate"
Wild Kratts,"I think we made a lot of good progress today. Wait here please, and we'll schedule your next appointment."
Wild Kratts,"If they really want to perform a Creature Rescue, they’d shrink herds of cattle, put them to grange for a month on a half acre, then bring them back to size. No more clear cutting the Amazon."
Wild Kratts,"You definitely have kids and have been watching Wild Kratts with them. That one is definitely not my favorite for the reason you stated, so it's usually when I tune out a little and read."
Wild Kratts,"Honestly, that sounds hilarious."
Wild Kratts,I have similar feelings about Vampirina. That show seemed so cute at first but now its permanently banned in our house because it pisses me off so much.
Wild Kratts,The Kratt brothers when they appear on the show in the real look bizarrely different than their young and spry animated counterparts. I feel like they really dropped the ball on more accurately portraying middle aged dudes.
Wild Kratts,"How did they react to it, being their fault and all? Maybe the point of it was to teach kids not to get angry at animals for behaving as they obviously would and to act accordingly around them (i.e do not become salmon shaped in front of a bear and then put it down when it attacks you)."
Wild Kratts,"This happens all the time on this show. 
My problem, though, is how narcissistic it is. Chris and Martin Kratt create, write and produce a show about themselves. They give the main characters their names and have them always out in the wildest landscape, seeing amazing sites, saving the environment, with the most amazing tech especially built for them. With the people essentially following them about driving them about and inventing things for them.
The way they talk about how they love to see animals fighting each other. Some of this just weirds me out."
Wild Kratts,"Odd Squad is one of the weirdest shows I've ever randomly seen. [Like full on Adult Swim level weirdness.](https://youtu.be/XdENWz0zIus)


I guess spoilers for a kids show: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15HHeaULkIk"
Wild Kratts,Love me some Odd Squad!
Wild Kratts,"that show is fuckin wild man, spy kids meets scp foundation."
Wild Kratts,"I love the cop show parody jokes that only adults would get. I love all the weird quirks they bring out of each character, like how Agent Otto eats soup weird.

It's a house favorite."
Wild Kratts,"Odd Squad is the goods. Actually, if anyone involved is reading this, there’s a little girl I love named Oswin and she soaks up everything about each episode. Almost five years old and a huge fan.She’s able to follow the math concepts but she’s studying the humor too. 

Anyways, what I’m saying is  “O” names are cool and if she ever heard her name on the show? I think she would run squealing through the house for at least half an hour. Just tossing that wishing coin out into the internet wishing well. (That said, I have no clue when this show was made or if new episodes are even being produced)"
Wild Kratts,I’m super impressed by their set designs. Always wondered how they got the budget for it.
Wild Kratts,My kids love it...almost as much as my wife and I do. If this was on when I was a kid I’d be downright OBSESSED with the show. As an adult though I’m equally impressed with the performances they get out of the kid actors as I am with the writing/world building/sets/etc. They must pick just the right kids and then have people on set working absolute magic with them.
Wild Kratts,"Odd Squad is this generation's MathNet, basically."
Wild Kratts,"Odd Squad pisses me off. You notice, all the competent characters have to be attractive. The fat kid is, surprise surprise, an idiot who calls himself Potato. Only attractive girls can lead in the show. The less attractive girls are nerds, dorks, etc. Pretty pathetic stereotyping if you ask me. It's the only PBS Kids show I won't let my kid watch.

Edit: guess I found where all the incels went. Touched a nerve, didn't I?"
Wild Kratts,It’s also a metal concept: a train filled with dinosaurs run by velociraptors that travels through time.
Wild Kratts,"Dinosaur Train, dinosaur train, Dinosaur Train, dinosaur train
we are going to riiiiiiiiiiide the Dinosaur Train!"
Wild Kratts,[Dinosaur Warfare](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hUUaMD2l7Ms)
Wild Kratts,"When you have to go potty *STOP!* -- and go riiight awaaay.

We just started potty training our little one and this show has been a major help."
Wild Kratts,"When something is new, holding a hand can help you"
Wild Kratts,My wife works graveyard at a hospital so I sing this to our 5 y/o almost every night. Some nights are harder then others for her.
Wild Kratts,"God-tier public transportation and for some reason Daddy Tiger and Grandpere don’t wear pants, but Mama Tiger does."
Wild Kratts,"Can Blue fish play, tomorrow?

No... Blue fish cant play anymore."
Wild Kratts,Daniel Tiger's Neighborhood acts like they are teaching kids but they are low-key incepting ideas on how to be a good parent.
Wild Kratts,"My two year old demands “the kitty show” daily.   I feel like bad parent letting her veg in front of the tv but it buys me so much time for chores and self-care!  Plus, it’s educational and not horribly annoying to listen to.   

We’ve started teaching daddy the cleanup song and will probably hit others as we go."
Wild Kratts,"I was not aware of Daniel Tiger's Neighborhood until my son was born, and so far removed from Mr. Rogers Neighborhood that I didn't even realize what I was watching until the end (I didn't hear the opening theme).

I actually teared up from the flood of childhood memories that came back while I held my infant son. It also comforted me to know that he will have exposure to the same quality material I did, if not better than what I watched back in the 80s/90s."
Wild Kratts,"Coming from a masculine household and not being able to properly convey my emotions, DT and my daughter have helped me tremendously"
Wild Kratts,My sons a year and a half and loves the show. It’s really good imo.
Wild Kratts,Hell yeah...
Wild Kratts,Wild Kratts is great. Family favorite here too. PBS kids app could use some help though. I’d pay for content on it.
Wild Kratts,"pinkalicious is the female caillou, and i fuckin hate caillou."
Wild Kratts,"I'm not sure I'd say it's outside his legacy. I mean would you rather a show be made by the guy's estate or by [his production company](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Rogers_Productions), including many of the people who worked with him?"
Wild Kratts,I can only watch so much of it because I miss Mr. Rogers so much somedays
Wild Kratts,Disney
Wild Kratts,What the fuck did I just walk into
Wild Kratts,A way for adults who are forced to watch kids' shows to derive entertainment from it
Wild Kratts,"My god, thank you for this. Now I have to dig up the outline for the YA action adventure I almost wrote as a sequel to Jim Henson’s Pajanimals."
Wild Kratts,Cheers!
Wild Kratts,"I grew up watching Mister Roger's Neighborhood, and I firmly believe that he would be rather disappointed with the spiritual successor to his show. Many who loved his show may remember his prominent display of the yellow traffic light as a reminder to ""slow down."" The frenetic pace of Daniel Tiger sells out on that point completely, electing instead to cater to over-stimulated i-pad children just to stay competitive. I think this show would fall closer to the TV that Fred Rogers ""hated"" when he struck out to do something better.

I low key fucking hate Daniel Tiger"
Wild Kratts,Same. My 2 year old loves it and I’m fine with her choice
Wild Kratts,You can watch some episodes on the PBS Kids app.
Wild Kratts,Odd Squad is like “what if the MIB or SCP Foundation was only run by kids and they learn math and stuff while trying to contain weird aliens in Canada”. It’s legitimately good.
Wild Kratts,All of those shows are still on demand via their website. My 3yo enjoys Daniel *and* Mr. Rogers.
Wild Kratts,Odd squad has some good jokes even for adults.
Kill la Kill,Whenever people say that Band of Brothers is the most realistic war show i always think about Generation Kill. No heroism or glorification of war but a bunch of children running around clueless with no leadership just trying their best. Spectacular writing and performances elevate this to one of the best mini series HBO has ever done.
Kill la Kill,>Y'all lookin like a bunch of Elvises. Trim those mOOstache hairs.
Kill la Kill,Fun fact: Rudy Reyes was portrayed by Rudy Reyes.
Kill la Kill,At least my mom took me to Nascar!
Kill la Kill,“Wake up Trombly… you’re missing the invasion”
Kill la Kill,"It is such a great mini-series.  Ed Burns and David Simon were on a roll in the 2000s.

The only thing I never really understood was the final scene when they are watching the video the guy made of Marines on his laptop.

Why did all the characters stand up and leave the room while it was playing?"
Kill la Kill,"Hey reporter, if you lay face down when the tanks go by it makes your cock feel fucking amazing!"
Kill la Kill,Anything David Simon linked is a masterpiece in my opinion.
Kill la Kill,"Totally agree, great watch for anyone who hasn’t yet."
Kill la Kill,"Which means the series is now 15 years old....alongside the HBO John Adam's mini-series: The years grow wings and fly away...

Highly recommend the book too: Think it was from a Rolling Stone journalist. Wonder if he did anything else?"
Kill la Kill,"oh wow looks like the real Ray Person is/was active on Reddit, he's got some interesting comments in /r/generationkill 

https://www.reddit.com/r/generationkill/comments/2wkoiw/why_does_ray_get_upset_in_the_last_episode_when/cp6h87y/"
Kill la Kill,"As the great warrior-poet Ice Cube once said, ""If the day does not require an AK, it is good"""
Kill la Kill,"Rudy Reyes is a host on the new show  ""Special Forces: World's Toughest Test""

Haven't seen it, but I assume he looks amazing."
Kill la Kill,Amazing series and introduced me to Alexander Skarsgard. So many amazing people portrayed in that show.
Kill la Kill,"Probably one of my favorite shows up there with the Band of Brothers, I rewatch them every year. It also got me to read the book from Evan Wright which was also an amazing experience. 

Jason Lilley also runs a YouTube channel, he recently did a video on Generation Kill

https://youtu.be/56XPak0tpDc"
Kill la Kill,"It's awesome but felt like a snippet compared to BoB due to the much shorter timeframe.

Heard it was pretty accurate and was shocked by how incompetent many of the officers were considering they are supposed to be professionals. Expected them to figure out training and selection after so many wars by then."
Kill la Kill,"Thank YOU, Sgt."
Kill la Kill,"For me, it’s a three way tie between Season One True Detective, Season One Killing Eve (I’m dying on that hill), and this series.

But just because my life experiences have most closely followed Generation Kill (granted, I was never Marines much less infantry), it’s got to have the upper edge."
Kill la Kill,"Another fantastic show to watch is Unsere Mütter, unsere Väter (I think the English title is Generation War? Otherwise it translates to our mothers, our fathers): https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1883092/

It’s a German show which follows a group of friends in Nazi Germany leading into WW2 who promise to meet up by Christmas. One of their friends is Jewish.

They are all *completely* broken by the end of it.

It’s an important reminder that, despite the horror, at the end of the day, the people fighting these wars are basically kids who’ve barely finished school/university and have been brainwashed or forced into horrific situations because of someone else’s greed for power."
Kill la Kill,Ziggy from The Wire was just such a good character in this
Kill la Kill,Evan Wright (author of Generation Kill/Beaver Hunt scribe) is posting tons of cool pics on his twitter! https://twitter.com/evanscribe
Kill la Kill,"Linked below by someone else, so I don't want to steal anyone's reddit valor, if you will, but I thought you might be interested in it (the actual Ray chimes in on the series):

https://www.reddit.com/r/generationkill/comments/2wkoiw/comment/cp6h87y/"
Kill la Kill,"The scene where they realize how accurate Trombley was shooting from a moving vehicle and that despite what he was shooting at their glad he’s on there side sticks with me.  Morality changes when one’s own life is at risk.

Excellent book too."
Kill la Kill,">Whenever people say that Band of Brothers is the most realistic war show

People who claim this don't really know what they're saying. Band of Brothers tells a very engaging and compelling story, true story at that, and one that should have been told

But when it comes to showing war's brutality and horrors it only scratches a surface.

Saving Private Ryan opening, majority of The Pacific and Generation Kill to some extent are doing a much better job at this aspect.

Omaha beach chaos, Sledge's trauma and Generation Kill's portrayal of military competence and decision making should be shown to any war-hungry or trigger happy person, or anyone who generally glorifies war"
Kill la Kill,PowLICE that moUStache!
Kill la Kill,Props to that dude. He had survival shows after GK and is in modern warfare 2. He is making the most of his beautiful self.
Kill la Kill,You mean *beautifully* portrayed.
Kill la Kill,"""Not everyone is lucky enough to have been raised in a whiskey tango trailer park by a bow-legged female whose sole qualification for motherhood is a womb that happened to catch a sperm of a passing truck driver."""
Kill la Kill,"one of my favorite lines, along with ""Puerto Ricans are just tropical Mexicans"""
Kill la Kill,"Because they didn't need reminders of the shit they've done in the last few weeks, that the video guy was seemingly proud of."
Kill la Kill,"Because watching all the bad shit all at once took away any sense of fun and humor they might have still had about the whole thing. It gave them perspective on what, at the end of the day, was really not such a great thing to have happened."
Kill la Kill,"> Ed Burns and David Simon were on a roll in the 2000s.

My midspicy opinion is that they are still on that roll. We Own This City was a bit quiet but really good, and much of what Simon has made after the heavies was top tier as well (Treme, Show me a Hero, The Deuce)."
Kill la Kill,"Still feel like 'The Plot Against America' is really underappreciated, especially considering the political climate of the last ~8 years.

I don't know anyone that has seen it but to me, it was tremendous."
Kill la Kill,"Every American should be required to watch John Adams. Well, except for that scene with Sarah Polley. That gave me nightmares."
Kill la Kill,The Lakers beat the Supersonics!
Kill la Kill,"> Special Forces: World's Toughest Test

the show looks like it's 100% propaganda but Rudy is looking great"
Kill la Kill,"The show was based on the writings of the ""reporter"" Evan Wright and he was only with the unit for barely a month. BoB took place over 3 years, from their training starting in 1942 until the end of the war in 1945. I do feel like BoB could've been longer even. There were quite a few events from the war that were never touched on in the series."
Kill la Kill,"Have to caveat, USAF here and more on the O side than the E,

But this is the most frighteningly accurate depiction of officers, only maybe rivaled by the movie Office Space.

I don’t mean that as a joke."
Kill la Kill,"Wow, worth the read, thank you"
Kill la Kill,"> Excellent book too.

I think the book shows the leadership, Godfather especially, in a harsher light than the show does.  Book Godfather comes off as aloof and disliked by his troops.   The show made it feel like Godfather was cool but middle managers like Captain America and Encino Man were the real problem"
Kill la Kill,GROOOOOOOOMING STANDARD!
Kill la Kill,Who is he in mw2?
Kill la Kill,"Damn, I knew that character model in MW2 looked familiar."
Kill la Kill,It's not gay to think Rudy is hot. We all think he's hot.
Kill la Kill,Even he left. Trombley is the only one that stuck around.
Kill la Kill,ok diggit
Kill la Kill,I agree with all of that!
Kill la Kill,">'The Plot Against America'

this is one Simon series that I didn't finish, I need to get back to it"
Kill la Kill,I'm low-key terrified to watch that one.
Kill la Kill,It wasn't as good as it could have been. It really fizzles out in the end Imo.
Kill la Kill,"I was really disappointed by that one, just wasn't as compelling to me as their other projects"
Kill la Kill,He is a beautiful man.
Kill la Kill,"The Pacific suffered from being stretched out over too long a period of time for the number of episodes for me, whereas BoB seemed to fit just right based on what they covered. The Pacific was still really good but it just didn't quite hang together as well; BoB showed a natural progression of men through the company's time in the war, whereas TP seemed to dot around more."
Kill la Kill,"Yes, I like how he said something like, ""Most of us are normal sized dudes,"" and then talks about how he could get the best of Rudy Reyes."
Kill la Kill,The real Sgt. Sixta was all about grooming.
Kill la Kill,Operator Reyes. He is a character model you can choose in the multiplayer.
Kill la Kill,"For those who don't get the joke: The real Sgt. Major John Sixta is currently serving ten years in prison in Arizona for sexually assaulting a 12 year old girl. 

When he completes his sentence next year he'll be sent to California where he has a 30 year sentence for sexually assaulting a *different* 12 year old girl."
Kill la Kill,"I don't suppose you could add a brief few sentences/words selling us on the series and why they're worth a watch and what makes them special? To me, I just see a laundry list of titles and genres honestly. 

Knowing the animation studio and year released is pretty much meaningless for knowing the quality of character development and plot depth."
Kill la Kill,">Flip Flappers  
Land of the Lustrous  
Mawaru Penguindrum  
Noragami  
Showa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu  
Tanaka-kun is Always Listless  
Tsuritama  
Yona of the Dawn

Aaand you have great taste! Guess I'm gonna need to take recommendations off the rest of this list."
Kill la Kill,"> Blood Blockade Battlefront

I was confused for a second there, then realized thats the English name for Kekkai Sensen."
Kill la Kill,"Konosuba definitely should be on here for it's hilarious subversion, wherein everyone seems nice but are terrible people"
Kill la Kill,My Hero Academia is also really excellent.
Kill la Kill,"I think you can also add Megalo Box to this list. While the ending wasn't as good, rest of the show was still great, and might actually suit most of the audience here. The old school animation and design, etc. "
Kill la Kill,"Next time I would include Animes that would appeal to Western Taste. Most of these will not be appealing for the general audience. 

Some good animes for the Western Taste (2010s only):

One-Punch Man (Action/Comedy. An overpowered dude that is a hero for fun).


My Hero Academica (Action/Coming of Age story. A weak powerless boy gets the most powerful superpower in the world and his tale to master this power without breaking everything in his body using it.)


Psycho Pass (Thriller/Crime. Dystopian Future where police kills everyone who has a hint of mental instability)

Parasyte (Thriller/Horror. Dude gets infected by an alien parasite but the infection doesn't go as planned.)

Edit: Forgot to add that these all have English Dubs. Most of the list above do not.
"
Kill la Kill,"Gundam: Iron Blooded Orphans
Is a great one, its serious, the animation looks great, it does get dark because it deals with children piloting the mechs"
Kill la Kill,"First, thank you putting this list together and trying to offer more exposure to an entire medium/format/genre (Japanese animation) that is, imo, underappreciated in the west. Now, on to a few thoughts/opinions:

When people actually ask for recommendations, it's best not to overwhelm them with options else they might feel overwhelmed and give up. If they get a response of ""Evangelion, Cowboy Bebop, Samurai Champloo, Death Note"" then they already have ~100 hours of watching ahead of them and those are totally fine options. 

There's a lot of comedy and slice of life on this list. While more variety sounds better on paper, I don't think those genres work as well as others with a language/culture barrier. They're usually more character focused and thus body language, dialog, inflection, dialect, translation, nuance, delivery, inside jokes, locality, animation style, etc. become more important. The usual Cowboy Bebop recommendations are generally more serious, conceptual, sci-fi, psychological, seinen, action, mystery -type series that show off what ""adult"" animation is capable of which result in more ""wow!"" experiences (and western media ""borrowing"" from them). The unfortunate ""anime stigma"" in the west is that anime is perverted and characters look/act like 12yo children (which westerners already have in the form of youth-targeted cartoons). So, while I personally really enjoy something like Kill La Kill, I don't think the over-the-top action, ridiculous plot, and easily misinterpreted sexualization would be a good starting point/leave a good first impression for the uninitiated. 

This list is great for those who have already watched most of the popular recommendations for westerners and want to branch out a bit more. That said, new fans should keep in mind that they'll probably dislike 95% of all anime produced. I've watched 300+ series and I wouldn't go anywhere near some of the stuff on this list. And that's OK; it's common with most hobbies/interests. Find what you like, look for more, have fun with it, share your experiences!

For reference, my favorite TV (top 10, random order):

Kill la Kill,Panty & Stocking with Garterbelt
Kill la Kill,"I was kinda hoping you would list [Uchuu Kyoudai](https://myanimelist.net/anime/12431/Uchuu_Kyoudai ) or Space Brothers in English.  Pretty good slice of life/sci fi about becoming an Astronaut.   Here is the [trailer with English sub for it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciS3fDqT1Vw )

Another series maybe not considered in the past decade is [Hajime No Ippo](https://myanimelist.net/anime/263/Hajime_no_Ippo ) even though the 3rd season (Hajime No Ippo: Rising) came out in 2013/2014.  Its a great sport/slice of life/comedy series."
Kill la Kill,Needs more Jojo
Kill la Kill,"i like cowboy bebop, ghost in the shell, FMA, samurai champloo

basically anime that does not rely on anime troupes and tells a great story, what would you recommend from this decade?

edit: action oriented is a plus"
Kill la Kill,I'd like to throw a shout for Terror in Resonance too. Great show
Kill la Kill,"Barakamon and Girls' Last Tour are two of my absolute favorite shows, and I'm pretty happy to see them make the list. Sora no Woto is up there too.

Those three are all slice-of-life type shows, a genre that can be pretty hit or miss, but these three do a great job of building a world (or a town, as in Barakamon) and making you keep watching because you're interested in that world, and the characters, even if there's no overreaching plot trying to tie everything together. They aren't necessarily exciting, but they're thoroughly enjoyable. And sometimes you just need a nice calm show like that."
Kill la Kill,Kind of a weird post. I'd expect at least a sorry description with each show. A genre doesn't really cut it.
Kill la Kill,"**Sora no Woto** is surprisingly good. Definitely not what I expected. It's part slice of life, part post-apocalypse, and also an anti-war story. And the music is fantastic. Occasionally feels like **Kino's Journey**, but somwhat less bleak. 

***
**Showa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu** is a slow burn, but is an exceptionally good period drama set in the post-postwar era where the Japanese economy was beginning to pick up again. One of the popular forms of entertainment was a style of traditonal comic storytelling called Rakugo. In an era where not many had televisions yet, they were often broadcast on radio. 

A recently released convict approaches one of the masters of this artform to become his disciple after having only heard his radio broadcasts in prison. Drama ensues. Lots of dialogue as you may expect. **Joshiraku** is a much less serious take on Rakugo, if you like terrible puns and Japanese cultural references you won't understand, this is for you. 

***
**Natsume's Book of Friends** is really one of the most heartbreaking yet heartwarming series I've ever seen. Main character is the only person who can see the denizens of the spirit world, resulting in him being ostracised by almost every human he meets due to his reaction to heir presence, but returning to his grandmother's hometown changes that, for better or worse. Partly episodic, but with some overarching plot. For another contemporary fantasy series that's kind of similar, try **The Ancient Magus' Bride**. **Mushishi** is also excellent and has a similar spirit detective vibe, but much more serious. "

in the vein of Mirrai Nikki, Madoka Magica, Shinsekai yori"
Kill la Kill,"My anime background is just the classics and most well known (DragonBall, Naruto, Bleach). Right now my only base for anime is Netflix. I've watched Attack on Titan, Tokyo Ghoul, Full Metal Alchemist Brotherhood, Sinbad, Death Note and One Punch Man, and currently I started watching Sword Art Online. 

Do you recommend it? Based on my viewing history and the Netflix catalogue what would you recommend I watch next?"
Kill la Kill,I would say you’re missing Jojo’s Bizarre Adventure. Besides being awesome it’s a cultural touchstone in Anime that is constantly referenced and parodied. I would argue it’s a must watch show
Kill la Kill,"\>K-On!  


My. Fucking. Man. The best taste."
Kill la Kill,"Devilman crybaby is also a good anime, gory , but good."
Kill la Kill,Add in wotakoi: love is hard for an otaku. It's a really good romance comedy that deals with adults instead of the regular HS ones
Kill la Kill,No love for Welcome to the N.H.K.?
Kill la Kill,"I'm someone who haven't watched a lot of anime since about 2008 or so, so I'll check out some of these, thanks. 

That said, I feel like the medium has definitely changed a lot since that time. So many shows now have either very strange animation styles (Kill la Kill, Made in Abyss, Devilman Crybaby...) or these strange formulaic stock characters everywhere (at least I don't remember people talking about tsunderes and moes and I don't know what back in the day). I'm sure there's a lot of good stuff once you get past these things, but in most cases nowadays I don't get further than some weirdass synopsis before I sigh and re-watch Black Lagoon or Claymore instead. And I'm someone who, despite not immersing myself into the anime/""weabo"" culture, has after all read and watched quite a lot of manga and anime in my time, and someone who likes 'weird' stuff Evangelion or Gantz.

I think that's the reason why Attack on Titan has been such a hit here in the West, despite imho not being that good of a show (it seems to go for repeated 'shocks' over telling an engaging story). It has a pretty 'realistic' and good looking animation style, characters that for the most part look rather normal, and though the premise is a bit strange it's very straight-forward once it gets going."
Kill la Kill,"Recently saw Made in Abyss because a lot of people have been raving about it.

The main characters are a girl of 14, and a robot that looks like a boy of about the same age.

I would like it a lot more, if there were not shit like recurring ""jokes"" where people look down the robot boys pants and exclaim that he has a penis. 

Like often when people were recommending it, I'd see em specify that it was not for children, and I kinda assumed that was because of horror elements or something. Like god dammit Japan."
Kill la Kill,"Ummm...My Hero Academia?

It's an amazing shonen series with much better pacing, animation and characters than a lot of its contemporaries."
Kill la Kill,"Another one I’d absolutely recommend if you’re looking for a more light hearted/comedic take on anime is “The Devil is a Part Timer”. 

Really funny, great story and quick watch. Premise is pretty simple, Devil comes back to earth and tries to take over the world...by working in fast food. 

If I’m not mistaken it’s still on Netflix, highly highly recommend."
Kill la Kill,Parastye -the maxim- should 100% be on this list. 
The Legend of Korra,"10 years?

**fuck you**

I’M NOT OLD."
The Legend of Korra,I wish Nickelodeon had more faith in this show. Not knowing if every season would be its last or if the episodes would even air hurt this show. It most definitely found it's footing by it was fairly obvious that Nick did not care for it
The Legend of Korra,"Say what you will but ZAHEER was one of the best characters I've seen in an animated show ever. 

Not only does he have a very undestandable and clear reason to be doing what he's doing (attemtping to end monarchical tyranny and the supposed status quo brought by the neverdying Avatar), but he has an awesome team who care for each other and clearly have a lot of (badass) backstory of fighting oppression Zorro style.

PLUS: Dude is so freaking badass he learned how to fly. 

Kuvira was also very interesting and the ascension of the fascist Earth Empire was a very cool (if a bit disappointing at the very end) plotline."
The Legend of Korra,"LoK had a lot of flaws that never made it great on the level of ATLA. Particularly it's bizarre pacing and storylines.

It's a shame that they never did a season set in the Fire Kingdom. Wished that S4 was about Kuvira invading the Fire Kingdom as Bryke originally wanted."
The Legend of Korra,I liked it.
The Legend of Korra,"> ""By allowing Korra to be flawed, vulnerable, and weak at times, the show made her incredibly strong,"" adds supervising producer Lauren Montgomery. ""A big misconception in animation and media these days is that a female character needs to be smarter and stronger than anyone else to be strong, and Korra's imperfection and character arc is what makes watching her rewarding."""
The Legend of Korra,What the fuck 10 years?… shit..
The Legend of Korra,"Season 1 and 3 prove that it could've been better than the original series if they weren't fucked over.

Yeah season 1 ended with Korra randomly getting airbending but that's the same as Aang and Energy ending, they both suffer from their endings.

Season 2 had so so so much potential in those first two episodes but they made Unaloq go full villain chasing power instead of keeping him as an (extremist) rival spiritual teacher vs Tenzin. I mean it should've been obvious to her at the end of episode 2 that Korra was lied to..

Also I loved the Asami and Korra relationship, shame they had to be subtle about it. (Asami in general was great) But it makes the scene with Mako so much funnier in retrospect as he's acting all awkward around his two exes, not knowing they've been going out for a month or so.

And god the animation was beautiful."
The Legend of Korra,Book 3 of Korra is imo the best season of both shows and one of the best seasons of TV ever
The Legend of Korra,"If anyone hasn’t heard it already, the original hosts of the Republic City Dispatch podcast reunited recently for a retrospective series that was pretty amazing."
The Legend of Korra,"I really want to enjoy this show but it's just not good. I've watched it like 4 times maybe more (ATLA is my favourite show). I saw it when it first ever released so I watched it both weekly and binged watched it too. There's aspects of it that I do like but instead of feeling like one incredible cohesive story it feels like a mish mash of ideas, throwing things at the wall and making stuff up as you go.

Korra in S1 and S2 is fairly dislikeable but that's fine (a flawed character makes for an interesting one) but the issue is her change in character when we reach S3 didn't feel natural it felt like the writers just pulled a 180 to make her more likeable instead of putting in the effort to actual develop her properly into becoming a more likeable person.

The supporting characters are also dreadful: Mako has no personality, Bolin isn't funny and his stories are boring, Asami is barely even a character she gets side-lined 24/7, Jinora is a walking D.E.M, Ikki and Meelo are annoying. The only good main characters were Tenzin and Lin (other characters like Zaheer, Kya and Bumi are good but they aren't there all that much). The characters in a story are the most important thing for me and that's where TLOK completely fumbled.

I will say the music, art, animation, action and voice acting are all top-notch though."
The Legend of Korra,"I fucking hate this show. People kept saying it will be better every season so hate watched this waiting for it get better. But the season finale was the worst. Right after how I met your mother. I knew something was up when asame(?) Voice kind of got softer but Korra and asame getting together in the final scene just came out of nowhere for me . It wasn't that it was too different from Avatar, but all the characters had no depth except from Korra. The series could've been better with an overarching villain. So, anyway this is just my opinion and I know I am in the minority. So,if you like the show, good for you."
The Legend of Korra,"Fuck this. 

Did I ask to feel ancient…"
The Legend of Korra,"I didn't think it was as good as The Last Airbender, but it definitely didn't deserve all the scorn from ATLA fans. I found it an overall enjoyable series"
The Legend of Korra,Fuck is this how getting old starts?
The Legend of Korra,"10 years jeez that went quick

Still a bit naff tho"
The Legend of Korra,Can we finally get the fire nation comic we were promised so Mako and Bolin would get character development
The Legend of Korra,I don’t care what anyone says. This show was fantastic. The fight scenes from the last season are incredible.
The Legend of Korra,"Mmmmm… prolly gonna get mad hate for this, but disagree. I enjoyed the first one because Aang made mistakes, but learned from them. Korra made the same mistakes every time, and when her friends tried to tell her that, she would throw a fit and say that everyone is against me, then do it anyway and get everyone hurt. She never learned or grew… boring character… enjoyed the series, but she was my least favorite character."
The Legend of Korra,"When I first watched this; I had no idea about much of the Avatar series or lore. I just knew that Aang was a big deal and he was the legendary hero that would save the world, but he was just a child. 

Even with the little lore I had, I still loved this show and I found myself getting very emotional when Aang would make an appearance. 

I’ll never forget when Korra loses all but her air bending in season 1. She’s defeated, exhausted, alone and at the very worst point in her life. Her friends and family offer to console her, but the grief is too much and she needs to be alone. 

We think that it’s Tenzin who goes to console her; but it’s AANG! His spirit, along with every single avatar, heal her and give her back her bending. 

I’m just amazed that Aang, who I barely know; is able to make me feel this sense that everything is going to be ok. And with him there, Korra would be ok and she’ll grow the strength to get thru it all."
The Legend of Korra,"Since when did we all get so old? I still feel like Toph. Depressed,  but like Toph!"
The Legend of Korra,"To quote the article “avatar, the legend of Korra still fucks”"
The Legend of Korra,"Good show, wish the behind the scenes wasn't hectic with Nickelodeon showing their lack of faith in it, which definitely affected the story telling.

 I'm still waiting on the followup show. One day, we'll get a new Avatar."
The Legend of Korra,Solid show
The Legend of Korra,My family watched it all for the first time throughout the last year. We thought it was great! This show deserves more respect.
The Legend of Korra,I loved the show. It took concepts from the original and expanded on it. My favorite parts were the thin line between good and evil. Like you could understand why the villains went so extreme.
The Legend of Korra,This show was such a disappointment. My biggest issues were the character writing and americanization with republic city which didn't feel organic to the world that was introduced in ATLA. At least it has its fans but I wish could be on of them.
The Legend of Korra,"I thought this show was great. Had a couple of seasons I thought could have been better (season 2 and 4 come to mind) but I thought the sequences and art style was brilliant.

Also, I will die on the hill that LoK had the best villains of the franchise in Zaheer and Amon. While the Fire Nation, Azula and Ozai are fun as villains but they fall under the mustache twirling villain type that revels in being the bad guys. They know they’re evil and relish every opportunity to kick the dog. Felt like Zuko and Iroh were the more compelling characters from the fire nation than Azula or Ozai.

With Amon and Zaheer, you had individuals who had legitimate concerns with oppressive entities (Amon and the equalists with the mistreatment of nonbenders by benders and Zaheer and the red lotus with oppressive and corrupt governments causing suffering). The problem was that their solutions were extreme and led to them being just as bad, if not *worse* than those they were fighting against. But they were individuals convinced they were righteous and not evil. They were near perfect examples of the “he who fights monsters” trope.

I also love how each them explored their aspect of bending. Being able to bloodbend at any given time and being able to use it to strip others of their bending using a technique mimicking the Avatar’s is brilliant. And finally getting to see the dark side of air bending was exhilarating. You get the feel that if the nomads weren’t pacifists, they’d have the whole world their bitch. The scene where he kills the Earth Queen was my favorite in the whole franchise."
The Legend of Korra,"Probably gonna get some shit for this, but I cannot stand Korra as a character. Drives me insane, watched the first season and maybe half of the 2nd and had to stop...

Glad people like it though, I do love the Avatar universe and wish there was more to experience."
The Legend of Korra,"Times goes flying, I remember watching the ending like it was yesterday and being hella confused. 

I skipped the entirety of season two (doesn't seem I missed much),I enjoyed the third season a lot but the last one was hella goofy. 

I feel like they forced all her romances as she didn't had chemistry with anyone. Really loved the character designs in that series, absolutely hated that dude that fast talked. 

Fairly Mediocre kids show with amazing animation and character designs."
The Legend of Korra,"Inconsistent from season to season but I still love it. However, nothing touches ATLA"
The Legend of Korra,That second season with all the spirits n stuff was ace.
The Legend of Korra,Have in been putting off watching it this long?
The Legend of Korra,Hard to believe it’s already been ten years.
The Legend of Korra,After that First avatar arc half through season 2 Legend of Korra really took things to the next level.
The Legend of Korra,"Amon, Zaheer and Kuvira are great villains. Also, Varrick is one of my favourite supporting characters ever."
The Legend of Korra,I loved the legend of Korra and I don't know why some avatar fans reject it. It certainly is better in some aspects.
The Legend of Korra,Yup. Still sucks. Case closed. Let's move on.
The Legend of Korra,10 years later and the ending still made no sense
The Legend of Korra,"I really loved a lot of the ideas this show had in concept, but the execution and writing was just not on par with the Last Airbender and the cracks were apparent in the first season and just got worse as the show went on and the studio pulled more and more shit on them."
The Legend of Korra,"The only good part of the season was the first season till the main villains identify was revealed, everything after that was shit

Also I do not understand why season 3 is so well liked"
The Legend of Korra,Korra was a ho tho
The Legend of Korra,10 years since this dogshit came out ?
The Legend of Korra,"One of the only shows that I think could use more episodes every season. It barely gave the Krew to really ""click"" the way ATLAs did."
The Legend of Korra,"Such a disappointment as a sequel to the original. Writing made no sense. It's like to be silly like the original, but tryed hard to address some serious topics at the same time. Completely disregarded their own setting and world rules."
The Legend of Korra,it sucked
The Legend of Korra,"Sure the show has flaws, same as any other, but Korra is an amazing protagonist and has one of best character arcs I’ve ever seen. Great, great show."
The Legend of Korra,"First two seasons are on Canadian Netflix

But not the last two

Like excuse me I'd like to continue this series legally"
The Legend of Korra,So you feel even older ATLA released 17 years ago.
The Legend of Korra,"Was when I started college. 

Jesus, my back suddenly hurts.

And suddenly I have the urge to wake up at 4am to catch the early bird special at my local diner."
The Legend of Korra,"It might have started 10 years ago, but it didnt end 10 years ago"
The Legend of Korra,"They had so little faith in the show, [but now to survive in the streaming age they must rely on Avatar (Korra especially) to compete](https://i.imgur.com/nUArYd5.gifv)."
The Legend of Korra,">Not knowing if every season would be its last or if the episodes would even air hurt this show.

This is only partially true. [Here is Bryan Konietzko's tumblr post about it.](https://bryankonietzko.tumblr.com/post/27078349740/im-sure-this-meme-is-dead-by-now-but-it-still) The show was picked up for Book 2 during production of Book 1 and they knew they had Books 3 and 4 before Book 1 had finished airing.

Later Nickelodeon did cut the budget for Book 4 which caused the clip episode and a somewhat rushed ending (really the lack of an epilogue) but a huge chunk of the series was crafted with the knowledge of how many episodes they had to work with."
The Legend of Korra,"I’m kind of torn. On one hand I wish the show would have focused more on Amon and the anti-benders because that was an amazing plot line. On the other hand, the lack of a consistent season and plot gave us some Kuvira. I kind of feel like the inconsistency and uncertainty really allowed them to run wild with creativity.

One things for sure, the world they built for Legend of Korra was amazing and definitely deserved more seasons."
The Legend of Korra,"I truly do believe that had Nick told Bryke from the beginning ""You have 52 episodes. Go crazy"", this could have been superior to A:TLA. I mean much of Book 3 is just as good as the best of A:TLA. Had they been able to plan out a story from the beginning rather than have to essentially come up with four mini stories they really could have done something special. Hopefully with the new shows they're making with Avatar Studios they'll be allowed far more freedom. I mean this is why Books 3 and 4 are nearly universally regarded as the best ones. They were made at the same time so they were planned together and very closely connected.

Ironically, the same factors that have led to the creation of Avatar Studios recently were the ones that led to how Nickelodeon initially treated TLOK. For years Nickelodeon has had a business model that it has been wary to venture out of. Air shows that appeal to children who buy toys. This has led to them cancelling many great shows in their prime that stray outside of this demographic, like Invader Zim, which appealed primarily to teens and young adults. You can't exactly air commercials for the hot new toys when a bunch of 15 year olds are watching.

TLOK received critical acclaim and it did have a dedicated audience, but that audience was not in Nickelodeon's primary demographic (again, it appealed primarily to teens and young adults). To make things even worse, they aired new episodes in Books 2 and 3 on Friday nights, when this demographic was likely out at parties or social events. I distinctly remember my sister and I staying home to watch the Book 2 finale rather than going to a party we were invited to. Obviously this was not sustainable. The show's main demographic simply *could not watch it when it was airing every single week*. Book 3 aired in the middle of summer and my sister and I just could not watch the episodes when they first aired because we were out doing stuff. By Book 3 the ratings were collapsing so they shoved it online. They gave the creators a short leash because while TLOK was critically acclaimed, it simply wasn't making enough money for the network.

But now it's been eight years since then and everyone knows that online television is not only a viable way to put out content, it is in many ways superior to traditional television. I mean when TLOK was forced onto the internet it was 2014. Netflix had like two original shows at that point. It was a fairly novel concept at the time. Now everyone and their mother is making a streaming service and pouring millions of dollars into content for it. Nick learned years ago that Avatar's audience is better suited for online releases, so they're finally capitalizing on that."
The Legend of Korra,"I agree with you 100%. But overall, their lack of faith gave us THREE amazing villians (not counting that anti avatar guy), and a fleshed out and mostly ""real"" feeling avatar/protagonist, AND a much more explored world.  


And, personally speaking, my favorite scenes or moments, were with Korra learning to deal with her trauma. A very real and not so ""happy go lucky"" look, at how life changing it can be."
The Legend of Korra,"In retrospect, it's funny that the fandom tends to blame Nick. I do agree with that sentiment, I know it's a big factor. But after a decade, maybe it's time to shift that a little to realize that Michael and Brian kinda fucked it up too. They should've known the limitations imposed on them. And I gotta say, some of their new ideas in that first two seasons, especially season two in general, are just incredibly mediocre and lame.

So Nickelodeon sucked at handling this show, and Michael and Brian didn't make their own situation any better too."
The Legend of Korra,"I always felt this show had great potential, be it to surpass AtLA or to pave the way for something new. I believe the latter occurred in spite of how it was handled by Nickelodeon based on shows we’ve seen come out since."
The Legend of Korra,"""Let go your earthly tether. Enter the void. Empty, and become wind.""

That stuck with me for ages."
The Legend of Korra,"Totally agree. Henry Rollins was such a surprising choice, and he did an incredible job."
The Legend of Korra,[deleted]
The Legend of Korra,"Not really, he is just an anarchist and he is not at all justified in hating the Avatar either, considering it has also kept nations in check. Hell the very absence of the Avatar led to terrible things not even 50 years before Korra started."
The Legend of Korra,He was pretty cool. Disliked how he just mastered the art of flying when I think not even Aang did
The Legend of Korra,"My favorite season of the entire show. That finale and when those horns kick in during the flying chase, mwah *chef’s kiss*"
The Legend of Korra,"As much as I love season 3, it was quite an excruciating experience because I had to power through season 1 and 2 lol"
The Legend of Korra,"I never knew that. Sounds pretty dope, and I never realized til now that S4 was perfectly set up to take place there (S1 was Republic City/Air Temple Island; S2 was the Water Tribes; S3 was the Earth Kingdom). Missed opportunity. Hell, there's even the dichotomy of the Earth Kingdom making territories within their land just like the Fire Nation did to them."
The Legend of Korra,"I still hold that a lot of these problems at its root is way more on how much Nick did the series dirty and for much of its production they were under (and for a lot of it, with some solid reasoning) the assumption that nick will cancel it right there and then so they continuously baked in ""stopping points"" in case it did just end but then it effects the ability to easily have the same level of a ""grand-arc"" that ATLA does."
The Legend of Korra,"If you want a story set in the Fire Kingdom I highly recommend reading the Kyoshi books. 

~~Also Kyoshi>>>>>>>>>the other avatars~~"
The Legend of Korra,"LoK was not as good as ATLA but nothing is that good. I really enjoy Korra though, I think it's just important to not compare it too much to ATLA and see some of the strengths it has. I will say the bending is sometimes better in LoK (probably because a lot of the characters are experienced masters) and parts of Season 3 are probably better than most of ATLA. It is a great show!"
The Legend of Korra,Still waiting for one of the comics to be set in the fire kingdom
The Legend of Korra,"Unpopular opinion, but I honestly prefer it to Avatar. I think it has higher highs, but MUCH lower lows"
The Legend of Korra,I loved it.
The Legend of Korra,I named my very first puppy after Korra and she’s the best pup ever.
The Legend of Korra,It’s much more interesting to watch characters grow and learn and change than to just “realize” they’re powerful and magically gain prowess.
The Legend of Korra,">""A big misconception in animation and media these days is that a female character needs to be smarter and stronger than anyone else to be strong, and Korra's imperfection and character arc is what makes watching her rewarding.""

The thing is Korra knew 3 bending arts as a child and Korra was randomly given mastery of the avatar state in S1's finale."
The Legend of Korra,">Korra's imperfection and character arc is what makes watching her rewarding.

Hence why season 3 is so well received and why Korra alone is so fucking good."
The Legend of Korra,"They can say this all they want, but one of the most frustrating points of LoK for me was Korra going through all this development and then still getting her ass kicked. Halfway through every season she's tossed around by the antagonist without fail and it truly felt like the only important fights she ever won were the final moments of the final fight of the final episode of the season. It was beyond frustrating when she goes through this huge character arc just to be beaten up by by the antagonist (Kuvira this time) halfway through season 4 AGAIN and I wanted to drop the show right then despite being so close to being done."
The Legend of Korra,"I thought Korra was a pretty cool character, and an interesting opposition to Aang. Him being the reluctant Avatar, to her being beyond hyped but both struggling with what that role means to them and their place in the world. I just prefer Aang because of his pure goodness and the overall tone of his story."
The Legend of Korra,I think this is spot on. I liked ATLA's supporting cast better but found Korra a vastly more interesting primary protagonist.
The Legend of Korra,"I know that the finale has problems, but the first half of season 4 is also fantastic."
The Legend of Korra,"How are season 1 and 3 better than the 3rd season of the original? 

They weren't subtle, they literally just made it up at the end that is the only Korrasami moment in the entire series, 5 seconds at the end of the final episode. To pretend they always intended Korra to be in a relationship with her is nonsense. 

The animation was all over the place."
The Legend of Korra,"While I disagree with any Korra season being higher than any Last Airbender season, I will say season 3 of Korra was awesome. I hate watched the first two seasons and thankfully kept with it to get to a point that was actually good. Your opinion is valid but I disagree."
The Legend of Korra,I agree book 3 of Korra was the best in the entire avatar series. i was on the edge of my seat the whole season. This is coming from a guy who watch Avatar when it premiered in 2005.
The Legend of Korra,">instead of feeling like a cohesive story…feels like a mish mash…

Because that’s what it was initially? It’s pretty well know that Korra was originally supposed to be a one shot mini series. But after season 1, they got an order for season 2. During season 2 they then got the order for 3 and 4."
The Legend of Korra,"Aang also repeated mistakes such as being too avoidant with his problems. Sure, he grew as the series went on, but this was something we saw for the majority of the series. Both he and Korra had issues they came to terms with immediately and over time."
The Legend of Korra,"That happens only for season 1 and that’s her character arc in it. 
 
By season 4 she’s a completely different person and she doesn’t do the thing you say as far back as season 2.

This is like saying Sokka is a sexist because of the way he acted in season one…"
The Legend of Korra,I wonder if being secluded and treated like a walking God by the white lotus had any impact on how a child develops to a teen…
The Legend of Korra,The subtext of that scene also makes it even better. Having lost her bending Korra feels like she’s failed as an avatar and there’s an assumption that she’s considering suicide in that moment in order to reset the avatar cycle. This and the moment at the end of season 3 are so bloody good.
The Legend of Korra,"I feel like Toph, but as an old lady.

EDIT: now that I think about it, old lady Toph has more energy than me probably"
The Legend of Korra,I didn’t dislike Korra but her arrogance certainly makes her more dislikable than Aang early on but her growth and how she faces the shit the show puts her through really makes her a fantastic character by the end of the show imo.
The Legend of Korra,I think it's nice to have some shows in your back pocket that you know you could watch any time.  It's insurance against a lull in entertainment.
The Legend of Korra,~your mom to your 10th birthday?
The Legend of Korra,Or if you want to feel *even* older... Batman: TAS was released 30 years ago.
The Legend of Korra,"Okay now this is crazy to me! The gap between ATLA and LoK felt MASSIVE, like I remember feeling incredibly hyped for Legend of Korra and thinking back how ""long ago"" ATLA was released. And now... 10 years since Korra? No way. That's insanity!"
The Legend of Korra,"Fuck, my mind first thought 

""That can't be true, I would have been 4 at the time""

and then

""oh... ... I'm not in my 20s anymore"""
The Legend of Korra,fuck you more!
The Legend of Korra,"I think early bird specials are for dinner, not breakfast.  They usually start at 4PM, not AM."
The Legend of Korra,"I think the biggest problem with the series was that it wasn't particularly... going anywhere.  ATLA always had the ever looming presence of a reckoning with the Fire Nation and each season finale was both itself a climax as well as further building on the suspense of the final confrontation.  Aang was behind the curve and rushing to master all four elements so each time he learned a new one the viewer *knew* they were one step much closer to the series resolution, it built suspense.

Korra tried to be more about teenage self discovery and threw out the meaningful looming Big Bad from day one.  So we ended up with a format that could feasibly run just like any other meandering never-ending teen drama as she awkwardly dated her way through the entire cast while the conflict was watered down to a series of season to season mid-bosses with no meaningful overarching goal to achieve beyond some vague notion of Korra building self confidence in a world where the Avatar was less and less relevant.

By turning it into yet another teen drama about self discovery they took away what made ATLA so *good*, and even the continued excellent world building can't carry a series they damned to mediocrity from jump.  It's such a powerful IP, but ""stereotypical teen drama"" is the one story that *doesn't* take advantage of any of that."
The Legend of Korra,Don’t forget that they premiered episodes of season 4 on the Legend of Kora website all but telling the world that they were no longer interested in making Avatar branded content.
The Legend of Korra,Also note that season 3 and 4 (IIRC) were booked out right (and together also if I thought) while much of the production and planning for season 1 and 2 were vague on even how many episodes they could get and was often hectic.
Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt," UNBREAKABLE!

 *they're alive dammit!*"
Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt,Tbf it is years since I watched this show and the theme still randomly jumps into my head and puts a smile on my face
Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt,Cool facts: Jeff Richmond is married to Tina Fey. He also wrote the 30 Rock theme song.
Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt,AHHHHHH….IT WAS FINALLY OUT OF MY HEAD !

Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt,I always thought the music from seasons 2 and 3 was absolutely beautiful.
Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt,That and Titus singing the folk song in Japanese as a geisha worked incredibly well in spite of sounding rough on paper.
Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt,also did all the girls5eva songs!
Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt,"This song was stuck in my head yesterday and I thought about how stoned I was the first time I watched this show. Good times and a great intro.

But now it’s stuck in my head again"
Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt,"tune is really catchy, yeah."
Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt,The second time I did Kimmy vs. The Reverend I skipped the theme song... and was rewarded.  I do it every time I play that special now.
Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt,Isn't it just a rip-off of [schmoyoho?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMtZfW2z9dw&vl=en)
Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt,"No. Fuck this song. And fuck them for doing what news channels do which is find the most uneducated sounding black person in the vicinity to get a comment so everyone can laugh about how dumb the person came off. Crazy part is I actually enjoy the show. But fuck this intro.

Downvotes incoming..."
Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt,It's a miiiiracle!
Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt,OoooOoooooooo *dammit!*
Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt,"My brother always heard that line as

UNBREAKABLE!

*alright, Kimmy! It’s a miracle.*

If one listens for that without the subtitles, I can hear how one could hear something like it."
Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt,“Females are strong as hell”. That and the pinot Noir song
Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt,"♬*Married, Liz Lemon got married*♬ 

♬*And made up this song*♬

♬*do do doot do do doot doot doot*♬"
Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt,"> He also wrote the 30 Rock theme song.

Not just the theme, he did the superb score for the show as well. Also was a producer on the show, which is like a composers dream. Imagine being the one responsible for giving yourself notes!"
Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt,He also composed the Mean Girls musical
Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt,👂🐛 nice and snuggly again for another year.
Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt,And the daddy's boy's daddy's daddy~
Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt,I want to watch the full play
Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt,[They were involved.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WYNbp0u8WjA)
Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt,🎶Females are strong as hell🎶
Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt,"Oh the score is amazing I agree, but the 30 Rock intro is also and EARWORM. I can’t stop that one"
Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt,"> Also was a producer on the show

Because his wife was the showrunner"
Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt,…and that’s where it ends. In the middle of a musical number. Everyone in the crew became so disgusted with what they were doing they all simultaneously walked off set and refused to return.
Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt,You can do anything for ten seconds...
Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt,"So weird what was once Netflix's flagship comedy, being made nearly 2 years after Arrested Development, is basically going out with not nearly as much buzz as it started out with."
Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt,"Sad day, no more of Titus' literal metaphors.  At least I got 6 more episodes to watch.

""Much like Icarus, a friend of mine who once put too many things in his closet, I put too many things in my closet."""
Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt,Did she break?
Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt,I’m so sad it’s over. Oh well. Six episodes to look forward to. 
Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt,I'm about to go lemonade on this thread.
Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt,"That's gonna be a, you know, a uh uhhhhhh... Fascinatin' transition...



#DAMMIT"
Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt,"aww, man. it’s ending? :( well, atleast we get 6 more episodes, i guess"
Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt,Can't wait to see The Punisher Jon Bernthal doing some comedy again (but I think it's only one episode).
Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt,[deleted]
Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt,"Watched the whole thing. I enjoyed the hour-long episode more than I would have. 

I don't think I completely understood how Tina Fey structured the ending, but I think it'll probably be a lot more clearer if I rewatch the show to see how the characters have developed overall. 

"
Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt,I have only ever watched her in The Office. is this show good. I keep seeing it on netflix and just never watch it.
Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt,"So, two Unbreakable sagas have ended this year."
Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt, I was in the show for the final few shots and I can see myself! Fuck yeah
Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt,And I am delighted.
Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt,What a flippin shame. I loved the energy of the show. There wasn't a single episode in which I didn't laugh a lot.
Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt,"This show has more hilarious, well written jokes in some episodes than most other shows do in an entire season, along with some of the funniest characters I’ve ever seen. For some reason, it doesn’t seem like it has that big of an audience (at least not after the first season).

Taste is subjective, and there’s more to a sitcom than funny jokes and characters, so I’m not criticizing anyone, but as far as my personal taste goes this show is criminally underrated."
Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt,The show is dead- damn it!
Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt,"It's a shame, one of the best shows on television. I am equal parts happy and sad"
Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt,not surprised... i didnt realize they made more than 2 seasons.. i got a few episodes into season 2 and got bored.. i did enjoy season 1 though.
Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt,I watched an episode of The Punisher right before Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt. Seeing Jon Bernthal on the thumbnail made me laugh *really* hard at 11:30 pm.
Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt,[deleted]
Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt,This was a great show! Sad to see it end.
Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt,Aww man I didnt know it was ending. This show is hilarious. 
Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt,Wait. Kimmy Schmidt is cancelled too? First Daredevil and then all the other marvel shows. What is netflix doing to me?!
Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt,[deleted]
Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt,Does this mean arrested development will be out soon
Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt,Pinot Noir....Rosanne Barr hahahaha
Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt,"Anyone else find it so bizarre we’re not really hearing about this? This show was HUGE and it’s kinda just going away silently. Shame. 

F. "
Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt,"I might finally start watching it.

My wife watched it and kept saying how good it was.
Then, somewhat suddenly, she said it started getting bad.  Not even sure if she finished wherever she was at in the series."
Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt,"Season one was great, season two was ok but then it got weirder and made no sense. I’ll watch the rest of the episodes but I’m glad it’s over! Ellie can do much better! "
Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt,"""Final"" episodes? It's about to die? Dammit! This show was a miracle, unbreakable, but it's about to die? Dammit! I thought that this show was strong as hell, unbreakable, but it's about to die? Dammit! This show was a miracle, unbreakable, but it's about to die? Dammit! Finding a new show is going to be a, you know, a, fascinating transition.

Dammit!"
Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt,"Season 1 is Amazing. Emmy-worthy. Season 2 is good. Season 3 dropped the ball.

Titus FTW"
Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt,"Is this show worth watching, like overall is it funny? I liked her in the Office."
Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt,"Is it good? 

I loved the first season, but stopped watching halfway through season two  - it was pretty bad. "
Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt,I couldn't get past season 2. Which means there's now 4 Netflix shows I've stalled it on during their 2nd season. 
Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt,TITUS NEEDS HIS OWN SHOW!!!!
Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt,Shame.. such a good show..
Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt,"So do I watch this first, or Glass? "
Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt,"I thought this show started out really well, but I couldn't stop watching at the super racist Asian characters it introduced. It was just so grating on a show that was already at it's limits on that front."
Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt,I've only seen ep 7-9 so far. Episode 9 is almost an hour long.
Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt,"This show was only getting better, despite loud opinions to the contrary. I can’t believe it’s gone so soon. "
Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt,"Awww, that sucks. I love this show. "
Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt,[I'm not overreacting. I'm lemonading!](https://youtu.be/sUYXk-QcXZ0)
Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt,I love this show...will miss it
Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt,Is the movie still happening? I might wait a while to start this because I don't want it to be over. 
Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt,Now give Titus and the son from Schitts Creek a show. Those 2 are the highlights of their shows. 
Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt,"I am just rewatching the first episodes of this season, Titus remembering when he was a bully and in the closet and then slowly revealing to Carol ""... because *I am* gay"" was hilarious"
Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt,The final 6 :(
Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt,I'm really gonna miss Titus.
Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt,We had best get a Titus spinoff. Nonnegotiable. We WILL get it.
Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt,THE VENGABUS HATH COME AGAIN
Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt,"Is this overly political?

I found the first half of Season 3 overly political. Every other joke was something related to American politics, which simply does not work for people in Europe. I didn't know half the people they were chatting about.

If I don't get 75% of the jokes, it ain't a watchable show."
Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt,I’m really going to miss this show. Titus is a national treasure.
Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt,"Wait, final?"
Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt,I was never able to get in to this show. Gave it a few episodes but just couldn’t do it. 
Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt,"Did it get any bearable? The last season has been horrendous to watch.

&#x200B;"
Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt,Nice ad. Thanks Netflix marketing team.
Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt,I forgot that show existed 
Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt,"The show is funny for the most part but I did feel like the last season was kind of misandrist in some of its content. Kimmy's book about how ""all boys are born with a monster in them and they have to learn to control that monster"". I'll be honest that's pretty offensive thing to say. I could see if they used this to examine the source of this feeling with Kimmy but they present it as this very positive expression. I just feel like it's become this acceptable thing to perpetuate misandry under this guise of being progressive. I'm a liberal but these broad comments are bigotry, just because you feel like it's okay to punch up it doesn't mean it isn't perpetuating hate."
Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt,[deleted]
Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt,wasn't there supposed to be a movie?  
Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt,"Now I can relieve some stress and masturbate furiously, thanks Kimmy."
Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt,"The last 6 were so bad, I'm surprised they made another 6.  Did Tina Fey remover herself from the writing staff?"
Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt,I will not be watching it. I was a fan of the show until I was told that every boy has a monster in them. Great message 👍
Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt,Just finished watching! 
Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt,Wiggle wiggle wiggle
Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt,This makes me happy and sad at the same time
Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt,"This kind of feels right. UKS always seemed like a show that had to end at some point, a story that couldn't prolonged indefinitely. "
Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt,Wonder what Tina Fey will make next? 
Justin Time,"Okay, Hopefully this will be a entertaining and informative kids show."
Justin Time,Those little shits look adorable
Justin Time,I think the anticipation has already evolved into decimation for *Velma*.
Justin Time,"Succession, Barry & True Detective"
Justin Time,"The Last of Us so far is shattering expectations and could very likely end up on my best of TV list of 2023 if the remaining episodes are as good as the first 3. HBO is on track to having the best television output again with the fourth seasons of both Succession and Barry out this year. The White House Plumbers and Love and Death have potential with great casts. Hopefully True Detective has their best season since the first. Reservation Dogs S3 hasn't got a release date, but if it comes out this year it'd definitely be one of my most anticipated shows. Season 2 was my second favorite season of television in 2022 behind Better Call Saul Season 6. It was a perfect blend of humor and heartfelt drama."
Justin Time,Justified: City Primeval.
Justin Time,"1 Only Murders in the Building

2 Succession

3 Ted Lasso

4 Yellowjackets

5 True Detective"
Justin Time,"I mean... 3 of these are already out...

The Idol (HBO) is *thee* one that's missing."
Justin Time,Masters of the Air.
Justin Time,Severance (Season 2)
Justin Time,"I'm really looking forward to The Three Body Problem. Just finished the books last week and am watching the Chinese version on YouTube

But I'm also really wary about how it will turn out lol

The Chinese version is going into the books hard. 30 episode series.  And it's kind of showing the flaw with that as some parts really drag. But there's a ton to cover and they're really doing it justice, for better or worse.

The Netflix version already seems very different as they're having an international cast (kind of seems like an obvious choice if you're adapting a Chinese book with almost all Chinese characters into something you're hoping will be an international hit) but the casting is concerning. Benedict Wong is a great addition but if he's playing Wang Miao and not Da Shi it'll be a serious miscast.  But other sources say he is playing Da Shi and the guy who played Sam on GoT will be Wang Miao (which I also think is bad casting).  

Also, I don't see how they'll shove this book into a bingable series for mass audiences. So much of it is just narration explaining scientific theories and concepts. Most of the characters can be very wooden, especially the main ones, as I guess they're more meant to represent concepts than actual people.

Should be a trip. Especially if they start doing books 2 and 3.  Book 1 is kind of a detective mystery thriller. The other two are wild with different dimensions and huge passages of time."
Justin Time,"Like a year ago, I definitely would have said Ahsoka, but I don't have much hope for Star Wars shows after Boba and Obi. Out of these, probably The Last of Us. Probably gonna start watching it when all or most episodes are out."
Justin Time,Mostly the same as the other replies but I would include season 2 of Yellowjackets.
Justin Time,Succession might be the best show in TV and it's back I think in March so that's the one.
Justin Time,The hate makes me want to watch it but I don't subscribe to that service so...
Justin Time,Funnily enough it was a hit in ratings for HBO max.
Justin Time,*Hopefully* that comes out in 2023.
Justin Time,"I gave it 5 minutes, it truly is as bad as everyone is making it out to be.  It is trying to way to hard to be edgy and call out Hollywood and society in general."
Justin Time,Wonder if all the bad publicity actually made people go watch it to see if it's actually as bad as everyone says it is.
Justin Time,Of course.There is not much that Reddit loves more than pushing a shitty show by hate watching it.
Justin Time,The first series was at best OK. We stopped watching the third episode of S2 as it was going nowhere. The discussion threads in /r/tvplus also show that no one continued it far past there so I have no idea why this would get a third season.
Justin Time,Just realized Justin is his nephew
Justin Time,"Spoiler:

>!After watching the end of Season 2 I'm surprised there is even going to be a Season 3. I have no idea where the hell they are going with this show. I literally just sat there looking at the credits like ""WTF"".!<"
Justin Time,They made a tv show of a book and aren't getting to the book's story until season 3? Fuuuuuuck that.
Justin Time,This is the best show on Apple TV that seemingly nobody is watching.  I see countless discussions about what to watch on the service and this show never comes up.
Justin Time,In 2 seasons they haven't left USA yet? What is this show about then lol?
Justin Time,"I like it a lot and I hope they renew.

It can be boring and a bit ridiculous but I find it compelling regardless. Probably just the Justin Theroux effect."
Justin Time,I turned it off when the weird scene happened with the dad wetting his pants and never looked back
Justin Time,I just watched the first few episodes last night and there were atleast 5 people with the last Name Theroux in the opening credits.
Justin Time,"And, Louis, is his son"
Justin Time,"Well I'm glad I didn't bother with season 2. I already felt constantly dragged along on season 1. It was entertaining and I was enjoying it but I wanted some answers on why they were running and they just gave us nothing, it was so frustrating."
Justin Time,[deleted]
Justin Time,"I’m usually switched on when it comes to tv, but I’m surprised there has been no talk of this show. Heck, I just assumed that the first season flopped given the middling reviews and complete lack of buzz. 

That negative review of season 2 and of Peacock’s Last Light from Collider make me think that Justin Theroux and Matthew Fox really needs a more ambitious and creature writer like Damon Lindelof because their new stuff isn’t in the same league as Lost and Leftovers."
Justin Time,"They’ve left the USA (Early first season), but are making their way to South America."
Justin Time,Pretty sure they >!cross the USA/Mexico border in the second episode of the first season!<.
Justin Time,Get outta here with your false spoilers.
Justin Time,"I'm much more interested in what Allie was into with his forecasting system than anything else. If we can get more of that in a season three, I'll be happy."
Justin Time,[deleted]
Justin Time,Why not watch both?
Justin Time,Is the title of the show a spoiler?
Justin Time,"Lol, I wasn't paying very much attention.  I just saw Theroux over and over again."
Justin Time,"Post more threads like this for sure. Always fun to read about some of the lesser known and hyped shows that are due in 2023. I was aware of some of these shows but I had no idea stuff like Mrs Davis and The Consultant were in the works. 

You do a decent job of selling all the shows on that list and that is often more than can be said for the distributors themselves!"
Justin Time,"This is really cool, I've seen some of these where the ""why you should be excited"" section didn't do much but you made me genuinely excited to watch a lot of these, thank you!"
Justin Time,The Curse is going to be fucking bonkers but it's going to be on Showtime so I won't ever see it
Justin Time,Warrior season 3 HBO Max
Justin Time,"There's a non-zero chance that Brit Marling's show is actually season 3 of The OA in disguise, knowing how creative she is."
Justin Time,"Fantastic write up, love the format. Already knew about many of these, but the 'Why should I be excited?' would for sure sell me on these shows otherwise. Specially the mention of showrunners, writers, and directors and previous shows, since is really common for people to look for new shows based on previous ones they've liked.

I personally I'm most excited for **The Fall of the House of Usher**, as a Flanagan superfan that recently watched **Midnight Mass** and loved every second of it and **Retreat**, ever since **The OA** cancellation my heart longs for more Brit and Zal storytelling.

I'll add **The Consultant**, **Mrs. Davis** and **The Curse** to my list, all seem like great projects."
Justin Time,Interesting that there's no mention on IMDB or the show's poster that Shogun is an adaptation of an incredibly popular book by James Clavell. You would think they'd want to let people know to draw in that audience
Justin Time,Woah the guy who made counterpart is making a shogun adaption?? Holy fuck I am extremely excited for that. Counterpart is one of the coolest shows I’ve ever seen and definitely the most unique spy thriller show.
Justin Time,Well now im interested in Time bandits
Justin Time,Nice to see a list that isn't just posting all the blockbuster shows
Justin Time,The ending to the time bandits movie was so messed up it still bothers me to this day ever time I think about it.
Justin Time,Most interesting is mrs davis
Justin Time,Really looking forward to the Apple + shows.  Mrs American Pie and Time Bandits.
Justin Time,"I started watching Willow and was thinking how cool it would be to have a Time Bandits TV series, so happy to see it on the list. The rest of the shows don't really interest me much at this stage, going by the descriptions. Could be some gems in there but nothing I can see right now.

Thanks for posting though."
Justin Time,"Not excited by any of those, but thanks for the post.

Hopefully something piques my interest in the next one.

I have almost nothing to watch at the moment and struggling to find new stuff."
Justin Time,"Or I can not access the streaming service or I dont have that service or Is not interesting enough. Or all reasons to once in the mayority of times.

But your work is interesting."
Justin Time,Looking forward to Shogun. Anything with Samurai Warriors & Japanese Culture intrigue me.
Justin Time,"Echo (Disney+) 

Agatha: Coven of Chaos (Disney+)"
Justin Time,"> Shōgun, set in feudal Japan, charts the collision of two ambitious men from different worlds and a mysterious female samurai.

That... Is not the plot of ""Shogun"""
Justin Time,None of these sound interesting.
Justin Time,How about some foreign shows?
Justin Time,"Great, more of the same shitty shows for white, middle-aged, alcoholic moms."
Justin Time,Only the curse sounds great on paper
Justin Time,"They pretty much all sound good, but really excited for retreat, shogun and the curse because of whose attached"
Justin Time,I try to keep on top of new stuff but there's a couple of things I'd not heard of that I'll likely read more about/check out
Justin Time,Only one I knew about was House of Usher. I'll definitely check out the shows from ''Servant'' and ''The OA''s creators as well as the one from Lindelof.
Justin Time,Honestly I had never heard about any of these shows before reading this. Definitely looking forward to a few of them.
Justin Time,"If Damon Lindelof hadn't already sold me on Mrs Davis, ""Betty Gilpin as a nun battling artificial intelligence"" definitely did"
Justin Time,Agreed. Excellent thread and now I have shows to be excited for. I’m pumped.
Justin Time,"To be fair, most of those shows just haven't started their marketing campaign. The important thing for the distributors is that people know about it when it releases."
Justin Time,"Same. As someone who loves House Hunters International *and* Emma Stone, I feel like this show was basically made for me but I have no clue if Showtime is even a thing here? And if not, where can I watch it?"
Justin Time,It's really not that hard to watch a show on a channel you don't have c'mon.
Justin Time,Paramount+ and Amazon Prime have deals on Showtime frequently. If you have Prime go sign up for their 1.99 a month Black Friday deal and watch Yellowjackets. At least if you're in the USA.
Justin Time,"Please God, I'd do anything for this"
Justin Time,we can only hope.
Justin Time,It was evil.
Justin Time,Shogun doesn't interest you?
Justin Time,What do you like?
Justin Time,Read the book. It is a masterpiece.
Justin Time,I'm pretty sure at least 2 of the 10 are foreign.
Justin Time,"There was one on the list, but I’d love to see more options too. There are some great shows out there we  Americans miss out on until someone like AMC+ or EPIC+ buys the rights. *This is Going To Hurt* was my favorite show this year and no one saw it."
Justin Time,You need to get out and experience the world more.
Justin Time,"Indeed. I read through the list and perhaps *Time Bandits* might work, assuming Jemaine can successfully reign in Taika still.

Also I don’t like the Horror genre but Mike Flanagan can probably pull off a big win."
Justin Time,"Yeah, only one of those seemed even remotely interesting"
Justin Time,For real…. but latter day snarky soap operas seem pretty cheap to churn out.
Justin Time,"I’m not criticising the networks for not promoting these shows that are probably not due until well into 2023. Most will ramp up marketing a month out from the release date. 

I’m just saying the OP’s article here has done more to hype and hook me for the shows on this list than the majority of marketing I’ve seen for any show released in the last two or three months."
Justin Time,No.
Justin Time,"It's difficult to imagine it being better than the Richard Chamberlain mini series, but I'm still looking forward to it"
Justin Time,"I'd like a new sci-fi show.

Finished up Star Trek DS9 recently and trying Battlestar Galactica but struggling."
Justin Time,no what ?
Justin Time,"The first season of battlestar is a bit of a slog, but it gets really good in season 2. The expanse is really good if you haven’t seen it."
Justin Time,"Yeah DS9 was the same.

Looking forward to BSG getting better.

I'll add The Expanse to try next, thanks for the recommendation."
Justin Time,"I thought solar opposites was great, especially the last 2 episodes."
Justin Time,Did you watch House of Cosby’s?
Justin Time,"I had the opposite reaction. LOVE Rick & Morty, think that Solar Opposites sucks. Sure, had some stuff that made me chuckle...but the show just seems forced."
Justin Time,[deleted]
Justin Time,I'm finding it beyond difficult to get through SO. It's jarring with all of the voice acting.
Justin Time,"Solar Opposites is great and very hard to not compare it to Rick and Morty. I felt like something was missing, and I chalk that up to Dan Harmon not being involved. That shouldn't matter anyways because this is a component show in its own right."
Justin Time,"Rick and Morty is good because Dan Harmon is there to reign in Roiland's creative freedom.  Roiland can't keep up with the content production you get from basically any other sitcom.  Rick and Morty just started season 6, and have produced 19 hours of content thus far.  In the same amount of time Family guy has produced 57 hours and 40 minutes of content."
Jericho,*The Good Guys* with Bradley Whitford and Colin Hanks.  Only lasted one season and ended ten years ago and I still periodically wonder what Dan is up to now.
Jericho,Pushing Daisies
Jericho,"Dead Like Me, would be the best revival of all times."
Jericho,I'll add Better Off Ted to the mix.
Jericho,"I liked the show Kings with Ian McShane, Sebastian Stan and Macaulay Culkin"
Jericho,"Utopia (UK version) it left us with a major cliffhanger ending that haunts me to this day. Also Humans, for the same reason"
Jericho,"Terminator: Sarah Connor Chronicles. 

They finally take the franchise in a new and interesting direction, and then they just kill it off."
Jericho,"Almost Human, easily. With an excellent cast and wonderful visual effects, it immediately drew me in with it's sci-fi aesthetic. 

Unfortunately, it suffered partially from Fox doing that stupid shit they do where they air episodes out of order so the developing relationship between characters was all over the damned place."
Jericho,"Deadwood.

It's excellent as it is, but would be widely held up alongside the all-time greats of television if only it got another season or two to wrap things up properly. As much as I like Brian Cox as Langrishe, that theater troupe thread is pretty much all setup, uncharacteristically so, for a later story that never materializes. It feels like dead weight. And while I appreciate the movie, it's too late and too short to even begin filling the void of those missing seasons, more like a chance to check in on the characters one last time than a resolution to what was left undone."
Jericho,Dirk Gently
Jericho,"Terriers. I still miss its soulful, low-key charm. Even though it ended prematurely, it's a great watch and ends on a suitably bittersweet note that actually works kinda well as a series finale."
Jericho,"Definitely anything Bryan Fuller: Wonderfalls, Dead Like Me, Pushing Daisies and Hannibal

And I really liked Prodigal son. :("
Jericho,"Got two:
“Life” which showed on NBC and starred Damien Lewis.  Second one was “Patriot” which is on Amazon Prime.  Both only lasted two seasons.  They were so good but never found an audience."
Jericho,The Brink. It’s one of the funniest shows I’ve ever seen and has an all star cast. It only got cancelled after 1 season because HBO decided to invest heavier in Ballers (football entourage with The Rock).
Jericho,"Jericho was a great show. I heard it got picked up later by some cable network, but I never saw that second season."
Jericho,John Doe. Don't know if anybody but me remembers that one.
Jericho,"The Last Man On Earth.

Just one more season is all I wanted."
Jericho,Freaks and Geeks. its so good :(
Jericho,Party Down
Jericho,The Mick was amazing. Kaitlin Olsen is one of the funniest people on TV
Jericho,Constantine didn't finish it's first main arc.
Jericho,"Counterpart,

It had an amazing cast jk Simmons is great. They story just kept getting better and better. Only lasted 2 seasons..."
Jericho,"Show called Awake starring Jason Isaacs. He was a police detective that kept flipping between 2 parallel lives after a car accident with his family. It was just getting good when it was axed.

Also really liked Life and Trauma."
Jericho,Santa Clarita Diet
Jericho,Journeyman.
Jericho,"Hannibal. 

Venture Brothers & Metalocalypse. (But, thank you HBOMax.)"
Jericho,"Carnivale.   6-year story canceled after 2 years by HBO for being too expensive.

Such a waste."
Jericho,Young Indiana Jones - cancelled with half a season in the can and unshown on US TV in series form.
Jericho,Life with Damian Lewis. That was such an underrated show.
Jericho,HBO's Rome. Was meant to be three seasons but the BBC said they would drop out after the second season and what was supposed to have been covered in seasons 2 and 3 all got crammed into a second final season that was a bit of a dog's breakfast as a result.
Jericho,"Carnivale - hands down. The end of the second season was... spectacular and to see what might have come next. I can't even imagine. That was a show very, very ahead of its time."
Jericho,Firefly
Jericho,[deleted]
Jericho,Terriers. Great buddy cop show on FX. Solid writing and a great cast
Jericho,The Grinder was hilarious.
Jericho,"How far back do you want to go?

* Warehouse 13
* Dark Matter
* Stargate: Universe
* Star Trek: Enterprise
* Firefly (as mentioned countless times already)
* Travelers
* VR.5
* Midnight, Texas
* Max Headroom
* Alien Nation
* Torchwood"
Jericho,I had a friend rave about Jericho I watched it and understood why but also completely understand why it got cancelled. Talk about a slow burn. The first three quarters of the show we're pretty boring then it went from 0 to a 100 real quick
Jericho,Stargate Universe. Show just hit a good stride in season 2 then the plug was pulled. The ending of season 2 was well done for a possible return but alas it never happened.
Jericho,Lodge 49
Jericho,**Almost Human.**
Jericho,Pushing Daisies
Jericho,"Forever - not the 2018 show with Maya Rudolph, the 2014 show with Ioan Gruffudd (Mr. Fantastic). Great show about an immortal who helps solve criminal cases while trying to learn more about his own immortality. I'm still so salty it was cancelled after the first season.

Playful Kiss,here's a [good read on Total Drama Island](https://www.reddit.com/r/HobbyDrama/comments/uptttz/animation_the_tragedy_of_total_drama_reunion_how/) from the r/HobbyDrama subreddit
Playful Kiss,This was a great read.
Playful Kiss,"That was quite the word vomit, and I remember Teletoon fondly as a kid watching it on weekends during sleepovers at friends places. How are you going to write all that and not mention some greats like:

-	Roughnecks (Animated Starship Troopers)
-	The Oblongs
-	Undergrads
-	Mission Hill
-	The Critic
-	Tripping the Rift

And some weirder ones like Home Movies, Quads!, and god knows what else I can’t quite remember. I do recall Cybersix being a little over my head as a kid though and thought the main character was actually a dude for awhile lol.

Edit - I also rewatched the entirety of Roughnecks recently and it actually holds up pretty damn well. The voice acting is done well, and even though the CGI is from that era, it was really well done. I had never seen it all the way through when I was younger due to missing episodes and their infamously bad release schedule, but it was well worth the time to watch. The last season got cut short and it could have ended more cleanly, but I still enjoyed it thoroughly even after all these years."
Playful Kiss,"I was there for the silver age. 

I really liked Delilah and Julius. 

And one I didn't see mentioned later on was Detentionaire. Came in 2011-2015 and was pretty good."
Playful Kiss,"I remember watching Undergrads and Clone high on Teletoon, you mentioned so many shows I totally forgot about....What a loss, but it was time."
Playful Kiss,Teletoon was such a big part of my childhood. I used to watch scooby doo every day after school.
Playful Kiss,Neds newt was the shit. You missed Dragon Ball
Playful Kiss,"Omg I forgot about Megababies. The theme song immediately started playing in my head. I LOVED Braceface and For Better Or For Worse! Ugh I grew up on Teletoon, from the mid/late nineties till about 2004. This post was so nostalgic."
Playful Kiss,"This post was a huge nostalgia trip for myself. Just thinking back there are so many shows that I enjoyed that actually were Teletoon originals and I just didn't realize it - it's kind of amazing! Teletoon circa 2005 through 2009 was my favourite period, mostly because of all the cool action-adventure shows that premiered in that time. I loved watching Chaotic, Bakugan, Spider Riders, Atomic Betty, and Skyland. I did also enjoy 6teen, the first season of Total Drama Island, and Johnny Test, but I never watched them consistently. From their earlier blocks, I will always have a soft spot for The Tofus, What About Mimi, What's with Andy (though admittedly I mostly watched the Romanian dub for this), Rescue Heroes, Maggie and the Ferocious Beast, The Kids from Room 402 (mostly the Romanian dub again)...and the theme song from Flying Rhino Junior High will still occasionally get stuck in my head :P 

I just hope that all these shows will be made more accessible for more folks to enjoy in future and not get put into an inconspicuous vault/removed from streaming without warning."
Playful Kiss,I just bought the entire Redwall book series. 20+ books. Hoping it gets another shot at the screen because it's prime for adaptation imo

Playful Kiss,"What if Louis thought they did? He states that he misread people a lot back then. It seems to me that both parties could be telling the truth here. 

Obviously, pulling your dick out and masturbating is against most workplace and social codes of conduct, even when given consent. I'm not saying that he shouldn't face some kind of action, ot lose out on some roles, whatever. 

But the extent of vilification he's receiving, I think far outweighs his crime of being a horny weirdo who masturbated in front of people a few times. I think we are crossing into a realm where we are abdicating women the ability to deal with awkward shit that I think hearkens back to old fashioned ideas of Feminine innocence and fragility. 

Now, if there comes evidence that Louis fucked with people careers over this kind of stuff or did something more aggressively out of line then that's another matter.

 But, honestly, I think we should just be laughing at the dude and moving on to actual predators, instead of finding enjoyment in a man's livelihood going up in smoke over some awkward shit he did years ago. "

Look, dude. I was one of the people who defended Louis when the only ""proof"" we had was a blind item from Gawker. In this case he only explained himself after the accusations from people came out. Previously he declined to even comment on the rumors. Also, considering he attempted apologies to a few of the victims it seems clear he knew he was in the wrong.

>Now, if there comes evidence that Louis fucked with people careers over this kind of stuff or did something more aggressively out of line then that's another matter.

While this is just one side of the story, I implore you to read their side from the original NYTimes article:

**Soon after, they said they understood from their managers that Mr. Becky, Louis C.K’s manager, wanted them to stop telling people about their encounter with Louis C.K. Lee Kernis, one of the women’s managers at the time, confirmed on Thursday that he had a conversation in which he told Mr. Becky that Louis C.K.’s behavior toward the women had been offensive. Mr. Kernis also said that Mr. Becky was upset that the women were talking openly about the incident.**

**Mr. Becky denied making any threats toward the women. “I don’t recall the exact specifics of the conversation, but know I never threatened anyone,” he wrote by email on Thursday. Ms. Halpern and Robert Schroeder — Ms. Goodman and Ms. Wolov’s agent at the time — said that the pair told them that they felt they had been warned to stop talking.**

> I think we should just be laughing at the dude and moving on to actual predators

Someone forcing others to watch/listen to them jerk off are ""actual predators"".  I acknowledge that it's not ""as bad"" as Spacey and Weinstein accusations but let's be clear.....even if it's not ""as bad"" as other it is still ""bad"". Bad meaning ""not good"". 

You're defending someone who admitted to using their power over others (being higher in status than them on the projects they worked on) to get his rocks off. I loved Louis CK's comedy and contribution to pop culture (Pootie Tang, his shows, his standup, etc.) but when it comes out that someone crossed the line with others and had people defending/shielding him or at the very least were aware of rumors (Aziz Ansari refused to comment on ""rumors"" about Louis in an interview, Michael Schur had heard about rumors while they were having him as a guest star on Parks & Rec) it becomes clear that something was wrong.
"
Playful Kiss,Is he a child???
Playful Kiss,"Im defending him to the extent that I think the reaction to his actions are overzealous, not that he did nothing wrong. Which, I think I made clear in my original post. 

I don't see evidence of him ruining careers in the section of text you've posted. Is it so strange for him to request that they stop talking publicly about an embarrassing incident? 
I understand that his response talks about abuse of power, specifically his position as being admired by these women. I'm just afraid that if the standard for sexual predation is: ""attempting to sleep with women who admire you"" I think we are in for a long, cold, puritanical winter in Hollywood.

Once again. Never said that he did nothing wrong. My stance is that what he did do, as I understand it, should be a near non-story.

Playful Kiss,upside pineapple!!!!!
Playful Kiss,I did not read the books before so I am going strictly off of the show. I am Team Conrad. I love Jer but I just got the best friend vibe. I didn’t sense any chemistry at all between them even when he admitted his feelings and when they made out. I actually thought he might end up with Taylor. I thought Belly and Cam had more romantic chemistry than J and Belly. I think Conrad and Belly have loved each other for a long time and they belong together.
Playful Kiss,"Honestly, I kinda was not rooting for her by the end. Her crush of an older guy who made her give up something with Cam, whom she actually had things in common with and seemed to get her better than either brother. She then almost kisses Connie and then makes out with his brother knowing that is going to not only upset her brother (see her freakout about her brother with Taylor) but also Conrad. She then half heartedly leaded Jer on but moves right back to Conrad. How is that supposed to make Jer feel?"
Playful Kiss,"I assume this show doesn't really fit Reddit's demographic since not many people seem to be talking about it either. Seems to be getting much less discussion than *To All the Boys I Loved Before*, but that might be because more people are likely to find stuff through Netflix. 

I never read the books either. 

- I never got the vibe that Jeremiah had a crush on Belly either. It's kind of disappointing there wasn't at least one platonic mixed gender relationship. I get they're all teenagers and hormonal, but I got bored by the love triangles before the series ended. 

- The Belly/Conrad thing was telegraphed so hard. Conrad just irritated me for most of the series, but I've never liked the ""dark, mysterious, brooding love interest who can't communicate his feelings."" 

- I didn't care that much about Belly ending up with either brother at the end. I guess in rom-com world one of them has to end up with her because the ending where both of them reject her because they don't want to ruin their brotherly relationship isn't satisfying to teen audiences.  

- I liked the relationship between the two moms. 

- Mixed feelings about the ending. I guess it's supposed to be a feel-good ending, but I don't think a lot of American TV shows and movies do a good job dealing with death and end-of-life choices. That's probably too much to expect out of a rom-com though."
Playful Kiss,"So I'm watching this and I actually kind of can't stand Belly? Honestly, she just strikes me as a really crappy friend and sister. I especially don't like how she acts toward Nicole, all friendly but low key pursuing her boyfriend? Then she brings Taylor to a party where she doesn't know anyone and basically ditches her right away and then shames her for making out with her brother. The line about ""he actually really likes one of the other debs"" struck me as very classist.

I liked the revelation that Jeremiah was bi and wanted way more exploration of that."
Playful Kiss,"I genuinely cannot stand Belly. Just for context, I haven't read the book so I'm basing this completely off the show. Belly continuously goes back and forth between Jeremaiah and Conrad having no regard for the fact that they're brothers and that if their ""love triangle"" goes wrong that it could effect so many other people. Steven points this out but she just deflects saying that he's trying to control who she dates. She leads on Jere even though she never had feelings for him and Gigi did. She assures Nicole multiple times that nothing is going on between her and Conrad. The show completely glosses over the fact that Conrad was leading Belly on while dating Nicole. Taylor also says that Belly is always self absorbed in her own story. I just think she's a genuinely unlikeable character."
Playful Kiss,"Did book 1 differ greatly from the series? I just picked up book 2 and 3 and wanted to start from there. I’m trying to avoid any spoilers.

Absolutely enjoyed the Prime series. But from what I’ve seen online it looks like they created a bunch of new characters and added in storylines."
Playful Kiss,I made a podcast episode where I talked about how the ending low-key ruined the whole show for me feel free to listen [https://anchor.fm/isaac-rant5](https://anchor.fm/isaac-rant5)
Playful Kiss,It also annoyed me that Jer only starting showing romantic attention after he saw Belly and Conrad almost kiss. Seemed more like jealously.
Playful Kiss,"I feel that. Belly from the book series was not this boy crazy. Yes there was a love triangle, but it wasn’t to this degree. The drama in this first season was probably spread out over 3 books, if that gives any indication. It was actually a much quieter book that probably would have been called boring had they done a genuine adaption, but I feel like they went too much the other direction. I feel it will probably resonate more with a younger demographic?"
Playful Kiss,"Yes! I get it, I was so over the love triangle. Especially because it’s brothers. And I get he had a lot going on emotionally, but I just don’t feel like we saw enough of his character beside brooding to be yay Conrad. I mean, I enjoyed it, but I had a lot of mixed feelings about things, too."
Playful Kiss,"Haven’t read the books either but I will say we don’t get to see much of her character outside of the whole love triangle thing. I hope future seasons develop her character more so she’s not defined by/taken up by this triangle and has other things going on.

I get that these love triangles and quadrangles are standard for teen dramas/ YA stories, but it wasnt believable to me that Nicole would spend any time with Conrad when he gives her such mixed signals and is unavailable. Like it’s clear she just there as an obstacle between the main ship."
Playful Kiss,Yes book one is a lot different and gives a lot more history and back story with Belly and both brothers. I HIGHLY recommend starting from book one! You won’t regret it :)
Playful Kiss,Are you blind? Jeremiah was interested in her since the pilot.
Playful Kiss,"It's at least better than the *After* series, but she did still end up with the brooding guy, so :/ . I actually haven't read any of Jenny Han's books, but do they always have this type of love triangle? It seems like ""To All the Boys"" had a similar structure as well. At least there was a little more variance with seeing her brother's relationship and her mom trying to put herself out there after divorce though."
Playful Kiss,"The reviews on Book 3 on Goodreads are wild. I wonder if the TV series will really go there if the show seems to be trying to be more ""progressive."""
Playful Kiss,You ***forgot*** UNCLE IROH!

Playful Kiss,"This is very interesting! Not exactly something I would have expected to see on this particular subreddit (is there a subreddit for categorizing speech patterns?) but interesting nonetheless.

  Did you come up with these statement categories yourself, or are you drawing on some pre-established category system? I think your conclusions look fairly sound based on the examples you provide, but I would say the criteria by which you sort the statements could use refinement. The difference between 'binary quality' and 'non-binary quality' doesn't really look like a measurable difference at all to me (why, for instance, is 'very tough' given as an example of a binary quality, whereas 'very annoying' was given as non-binary? Is it solely the sentence structure that defines which of the two it is, not the descriptor?)

  You've got me thinking about this and I didn't expect to think about this today (or any day), so that's a win."

A more or less popular subreddit for ""categorizing speech patterns"" would be like literal heaven to me!

> The difference between 'binary quality' and 'non-binary quality' doesn't really look like a measurable difference at all to me (why, for instance, is 'very tough' given as an example of a binary quality, whereas 'very annoying' was given as non-binary?)

Could you give examples of problems with other distinctions? The ""binary/non-binary"" one turned out to be the weakest in this analysis.

You're right, if we're comparing specifically ""very tough"" and ""very annoying"" - they're the same. I was thinking about something else, but the fishing example of ""binary"" is probably not very good anyway. 

> Is it solely the sentence structure that defines which of the two it is, not the descriptor?

The category of a description is never truly defined, it depends on the context of other descriptions. *(the fishing examples skip that)* I made an illustration about this: [here](https://i.imgur.com/FBSGtbk.png).

Circles are like quotes. Colors are like categories potentially applicable to those quotes. Any particular circle can be just a mess of colors, but when you check a **group** of circles - you may notice the color that pops up more often than others. In the upper line it's **red**, in the lower line - it's **green**.

A weirder illustration, with trees: [here](https://i.imgur.com/EI5st53.png). Upper pictures emphasize tree trunks in a special way (compared to the lower ones), even though tree trunks are present in every single picture. Elements of the trees are the same, but you pay different kinds of attention to them. It's a weirder illustration, but I like it more than the color one: I like to think about my categories as ""attention patterns"".

> You've got me thinking about this and I didn't expect to think about this today (or any day), so that's a win.

I don't know how to objectively test the idea by myself (I'm not a programmer, I don't know a cheap way to generate many speech tests), so I want to get people interested in this topic by posting analyzes.

I think that categories like this can be applied to the speech of real people... and if speech patterns exist, people should know about them.

Do you think there's a way to share something like this with linguists or machine learning people?"
Playful Kiss,"I don't have paramount+, but do they combine multipart episodes to one? That cutting out 6 episodes sounds about right."
Playful Kiss,"ATLA has 61 episodes. They probably just combined The Day of Black Sun episodes (+1), The Boiling Rock episodes (+1) and Sozin's Comet episodes (+3).

56 + 5 = 61 episodes."
Playful Kiss,"> Circles are like quotes. Colors are like categories potentially applicable to those quotes. Any particular circle can be just a mess of colors, 

Ah, so what you're saying is that they're not intended to be mutually exclusive descriptors. That may be where I was seeing ambiguity; I understood the categories to be akin to dividing lines, not independent 'applies / does not apply' assessments. 

  Knowing this, I don't think I have any further individual instances to point out in the quotes you categorize; any discrepancy between my evaluation and yours is likely to just be a difference in judgment, not an objective difference. (Which one could say means the system needs further refinement? Generally, the purpose of rules for quantifying something is to allow different individuals to reach consistent conclusions over different sets of data by applying consistent judgment criteria.)

  I'm not a programmer either, but in any case, to use a program for this you would almost certainly need to be able to express your qualifying criteria in pure logic such as (If word = Verb And location(word) = 3...) or something along those lines. So you would first have to do that, and to do _that_ you would probably have to do a really deep dive into the theoretical construction of the English language to understand what strictly quantifiable constructs and patterns correlate to your definitions. And the English language is an contradictory bitch, so _that_ is probably where this spirals into impossibly complex territory perhaps better approached by machine learning or something.

  If I had infinite free time I would try it myself, but I most certainly do not so that's about as far as I can speculate.

  As for where you could share this: Hell if I know! I'm an amateur writer of fiction and a Material Engineer. The former is why I'm interested, and the latter is where I got enough programming experience to begin to speculate on what you would need to approach programming something related to this, but neither mean I'm in any way involved in or even aware of a relevant field. Maybe look for groups of hobbyist linguists? That might be something that exists."

I think there're problems if we disagree about whole groups of quotes. If you look at a bunch of quotes of Katara and a bunch of quotes of Aang and don't see how they gravitate towards different descriptions - I didn't reach my goal. But if we agree, you can say that the rules are consistent for groups of quotes.

> And the English language is an contradictory bitch, so *that* is probably where this spirals into impossibly complex territory perhaps better approached by machine learning or something.

I agree and think that maybe even without language contradictions such approach could be still impossible: you need to analyze the quotes in context of each other + you may need at least on some level understand the actual ""meaning"" of the quotes.

But by testing I meant this (sorry for not clarifying): you could use a program to take, let's say, random redditor's quotes and generate a test for a human. A test can give you **N** sets of quotes and ask you what sets you're sure don't correspond to a single person. (If speech patterns exist you should be able to do that.) If you can solve those tests and teach others to solve them, it won't prove the idea outright ('cause personal information can get into samples and serve as a hint), but should spark more interest in investigating the issue further. It also won't be testing my particular descriptions, but the general idea that distinct universal speech patterns exist. The idea that you can tell apart the speech of people you don't know.

I can ask a friend to make **1** test for me, but what if I need **50** tests to do a little bit of training? 

> but neither mean I'm in any way involved in or even aware of a relevant field. Maybe look for groups of hobbyist linguists? That might be something that exists.

I see... thank you for the idea about hobbyists! I myself heard about [Stylometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stylometry) (but it's usually not about **universal** patterns, as I understood) and [Discourse analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discourse_analysis).

As I've wrote about the tests I started thinking... maybe it's possible to get people interested in creating a ""speech tester"" just for fun? I guess it can be funny or interesting even if you don't believe in the patterns, since anything can come up in random quotes (funny, thoughtful, important or sad)."
Playful Kiss,"However different our tastes may be, I think it's great how you always seem to put such a lot of effort into your writings.

>Shows categorized based on originality, creativity and innovation

It's not easy reconciling the above with some of your actual ratings: *Firefly Lane* (just as an example, I haven't seen it) you give a 6.8 - a rating you subsequently explain by calling the show ""forgettable"", and by saying it ""does nothing to stand out"".

So... How can a show seemingly so wholly lacking in originality, creativity, and innovation *measured by those very same categories* still get a 6.8? Shouldn't it be more like, I dunno, a 2? Or do you count up to 100? How exactly did you arrive at the (very precise!) number 6.8?"

Playful Kiss,"*This is a long-ass post, but I didn't wanna split it.*

**THESE WERE OK...**

* [Dom](https://www.reddit.com/r/television/comments/nzwljg/dom_amazon_has_an_interesting_crime_and_drugs/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) (Amazon) - **7.5**

Dom is a very hard series to label '*good*' or '*bad*'. It certainly holds your attention throughout, with it's emotional stories about addiction, exciting burglary scenes, intriguing drug busts operations and gorgeous locations, but it's all so disjointed and incoherently written.

&#x200B;

* [Pørni](https://www.reddit.com/r/television/comments/nxg85s/if_you_like_better_things_youll_like_pørni/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) (Viaplay) - **6.0** \[DNF\]

Porni doesn't do too bad at accomplishing what it sets out to accomplish. It's a very genuine and relatable series about motherhood, there just isn't anything here that makes it stick out. Not the plot, not the characters, not anything really.

&#x200B;

* [Mare of Easttown](https://www.reddit.com/r/television/comments/npc6zj/great_performances_and_characters_saves_mare_of/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) (HBO) - **7.0**

Mare of Easttown is by all means a well put together series, my issue is there's not an ounce of originality to be found here. It's too typical a '*whodunnit*' detective mystery-drama, in the same style and execution we've seen a million times already. The performances and character work act as saving grace, but at the same time its not like we haven't seen character work or emotional weight of this magnitude before.

&#x200B;

* [Genera+ion](https://www.reddit.com/r/television/comments/murgmw/generaion_hbo_max_feels_like_a_cheaper_version_of/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) (HBO) - **7.5**

Genera+ion does have potential, but so far, besides it being more LGBTQ+ centric, hasn't branched out beyond being the average teen show. They do have opportunity to make some audacious and daring decisions here with a very strong group of characters, whether or not they will capitalize, we'll see, but Genera+ion definitely needs something to stand out. Crazy enough the best episode here so far is the one directed by Lena Dumhum. From her 'Girls' days she's always been a master of making great episodes that are literally about nothing.

&#x200B;

* [¿Quién mató a Sara?](https://www.reddit.com/r/television/comments/mtdlo4/qui%C3%A9n_mat%C3%B3_a_sara_netflix_is_absurd_illogical_and/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) (Netflix) - **5.7**

This one falls into '*so bad it's good*' territories. A series that's bat shit crazy, overly dramatic and unpredictable in the sense that the writers don't give fuck all about consistency, cohesion... or logic. Mexican telenovela at its finest.

&#x200B;

* [WandaVision](https://www.reddit.com/r/television/comments/lzrqhu/2021_series_writeups_9_wandavision_disney/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) (Disney+) - **7.7**

The most creatively ambitious work the MCU has put out so far, but not fully committing to its more ambitious ideas lead it to falling into familiar 'formulaic superhero' territories by the end of it.

&#x200B;

* [Behind Her Eyes](https://www.reddit.com/r/television/comments/lmsyhk/behind_her_eyes_netflix_is_either_baffling_or/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) (Netflix) - **7.2**

A psychological-thriller that's fascinating... baffling... and bat-shit crazy! I'm not sure what to even say the premise of this is. What starts out as a 'unconventional love-triangle', develops into something so... left-field. The writing is more in line with a soap-opera, but it's one of the most unpredictable stories I've ever seen if you ask me.

&#x200B;

* [3 Caminos](https://www.reddit.com/r/television/comments/l78f1c/3_caminos_amazon_prime_is_wonderfully_ambitious/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) (Amazon) - **7.0**

Following a group of friends from the year they met while *walking the camino*, to different period in their life throughout the years where they would walk it again and again, 3 Caminos is centered around the Camino de Santiago and feels very much like an advertisement for the ""spiritual"", ""life-changing"" walk. Apparently it's funded by the European Tourism Board, and that will put things into perspective when you watch it, but besides having to hear the word ""Camino"" over and over again the series does have its upsides. Its stunning visuals and scenery for one, also its very calm and tranquil atmosphere, plus the feeling you get at the end, like you've just finished watching something very profound, meaningful and life-changing... even though you haven't."
Playful Kiss,">Inspired by the true life story of Christiane F., unlike the 1981 film Wir Kinder vom Bahnof Zoo takes a more stylistic approach, modernizing the 1970s with contemporary music, glossy visuals and unexpected surrealism as it tells the tragic story of kids on drugs.

Not with you on that. But, I read the book for at least 5 times, and maybe find it hard to separate. Still, I feel its a bit a case of many overwritten drama shows. In the book - which I found a much tougher read today as back then when parents and teachers used it as anti-drug-pamphlet - there is foucs on the social background, but still I got more the sense that a lot of this teenagers where hapless kids that were overwhelmed by what happened. Got shocked how easy it was in the 1970ies to go to the center of Berlin as a John and buy teenage junkies for sex.

With you on ""Yasuke"". Generally I am not fond of the trend started by Castlevania to make this super short anime series. I wished ""Yasuke"" had some filler episodes. Too crammed with everything they could pull out of their minds."
Playful Kiss,"Following the list:

Invincible is absolutely a 8 from me too.

On Wonder Egg right now, looks atleast a 8 so far is in itself its gonna be worth it

Playful Kiss,Save
Playful Kiss,Does anyone know any shows that is like Dark?
Playful Kiss,I recommend Scenes from a Marriage on HBO. Its very well acted and well written.
Playful Kiss,Of those i have seen probably invincible.
Playful Kiss,"Oh that's because the 'rating' I give when I *review* a series, isn't just '*how I feel about the series from 1-10*'. Well... it is and it isn't. Originality, creativity and innovation are still the basis of my ratings and the determining factors as to whether or not I like something... but I still rate all the essential elements, then use the average as the final score.

Hopefully this makes more sense.

    > Firefly Lane:
    Originality/Creativity : 6 
    writing (plot & cha): 7 
    writing (dia): 6 
    acting: 8 
    visuals/cine: 7 
    prod.: 7 
    rating: 6.8

I don't post it like this because it makes more sense in my head then when shared lol. Rating the visuals, acting, writing etc. individually then using the average as the final score allows me to work out how good i thought something was overall without thinking about it directly you know.... I also remove 1.0 point whenever I don't finish something. It might sound weird... but Im just glad someone cared enough to ask. lol."
Playful Kiss,That's because you haven't seen Wonder Egg Priority yet. 😉
Playful Kiss,Kate Winslet was just phenomenal in that. Some of the finest acting that I have ever seen. The rest of the supporting cast were all really good also.
Playful Kiss,Is it too America centric?
Playful Kiss,"For all Mankind is a hidden gem, if it were on any other network it would be massively popular. Fantastic show."
Playful Kiss,many words written
Playful Kiss,Yea... that's what I'm doing here.
Playful Kiss,"mmmm,,,,, this actually looks interesting. Doubt I'll have time for it though. And yea it's a 2021 release."
Playful Kiss,"Mare of Easttown at a 7/10? Id give it a 9.5, its one of the best crime mystery shows in awhile, and Kate Winslet alone makes it worth watching"
Playful Kiss,"I agree 100% with MoE when I was watching it i felt like I watched this thing 100 times before, not a bad show but I will say it’s one of the most overrated shows of 2021"
Playful Kiss,"WandaVision was more than okay, but IRYO."
Playful Kiss,"> Not with you on that

On what exactly, that I called it stylistic, that I listed it under ""outstanding"" or both? 

Probably a case of separating book from adaptation as you said. I haven't read the book myself but according to several reactions I've seen from people who like both (and the disclaimer at the start of each episode emphasizing that it's merely ""inspired by"" these events), you're suppose to take the series as its own thing. There are new characters, their relations are different and none of their backstories (besides Christiane's) are the same as in the book/film apparently. 

Taking the series for what it is I thought it was pretty great. The concept of modernizing the 1970s with a surrealistic approach is fantastic and something we haven't seen before. And out course it's still one of the most daring things on the TV platform to the point where it isn't even available for U.S. viewers on Prime (or at least it wasn't). Plus it still packs an emotional punch showing the consequences of drug use.... I fucks with it. lol."
Playful Kiss,"what does ""as a John"" mean in this context, american?"

Skip the OVA special. 😖"
Playful Kiss,What? 😐
Playful Kiss,"* The Rain

Playful Kiss,The OA
Playful Kiss,Ehh idk if I'll have time for it to be honest. I feel like the original is enough.
Playful Kiss,"Indeed, (6 + 7 + 6 + 8 + 7 + 7) / 6 ≈ 6.8, but why don't you weigh ""Originality/Creativity"" more than the other categories? After all:

>Shows categorized based on originality, creativity and innovation (as those are the 3 main factors I look for in TV shows)

And what exactly is ""prod.""? Direction? Editing?

Also: no category for scoring/music... Have you no decency? Or actual hearing loss?

>I also remove 1.0 point whenever I don't finish something

Why not just subtract 1 point per unwatched episode - this way you can get into negative numbers when something is *really* awful, especially when rating 20+ episode network nonsense..."
Terror in Resonance,"The entire soundtrack was released a day before the first episode aired, and it's beautiful. As expected with Yoko Kanno. The first episode also had me hooked. I'm very excited for this show."
Terror in Resonance,[I ended up uploading the snowmobile chase scene because it blew me away.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LVOlbmytNc) One of the best opening scenes I've seen in a long time. 
Terror in Resonance,"For this season, Terror's OP is really good, but I also like the [OP to Aldnoah.Zero](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whB2mkTct9w) and it's soundtrack too. Warning, the OP has something that is a spoilers for the second episode.

There's also some major Kira-Athrun vibes between Inaho and Slaine."

Terror in Resonance,Big Sam emerges from the well.
Terror in Resonance,The only thing I know about Bolton is the strid and that is already quite real and horrifying
Terror in Resonance,Will be shown on BBC 3. So a 90% chance of it being hot garbage.
Terror in Resonance,"I've been to Jarrow once, northern horror indeed"
Terror in Resonance,"Different Bolton unfortunately, this Bolton is just a shithole."
Terror in Resonance,"If you ever get a chance do a tour of the WB set in Burbank CA. Hopefully you will get a chance to see one of the sound stages that has a show that is not shooting so you can see it.

It is just incredible what they manage to do in sound stages."
Terror in Resonance,"It really blew my mind how many completely different atmospheres and aesthetics and colors they managed to get out of mostly one set, in an almost completely arctic white environment. From the sickly orange-yellow fog to the aurora.

This show was something else."
Terror in Resonance,"Similarly, I was shocked to learn that 1899 was shot pretty much entirely indoors against an [LED backdrop](https://techcrunch.com/2022/02/10/dark-bay-1899-virtual-production/). It gives the show a very specific vibe that makes total sense within the context of the show."

Terror in Resonance,"This is such a weird coincidence. I'm literally in the middle of a rewatch right now, just started episode 5. Haven't watched it in 3 years. Such a great show."
Terror in Resonance,I....am not. It would have been virtually impossible to make that show in real arctic like conditions.
Terror in Resonance,"I absolutely loved the first season of the show but honestly it kind of took away from the atmosphere and immersion once I found out it was all filmed indoors. I know it’s probably too much to ask and a logistical nightmare, but it would’ve been incredible if they actually filmed somewhere cold and remote."
Terror in Resonance,"It was much more surprising for me to learn that the Arctic scenes were shot on a beach in Croatia, lmao."
Terror in Resonance,That show/season was incredible. I'll never forget the haunting moans coming from Stephen Graham's character after his incident. I am starting the blur it with The North Water though...so maybe need to re-watch both!
Terror in Resonance,"It worked very well.  

Early Mandalorian has a few moments where it was obviously a stage of some sort and the actor had no idea what was going on around them.  They are learning to use it right."
Terror in Resonance,"The entirety of the film beyond one character is CGI, so that's not surprising. I doubt they even use any actual set-ground in the final movie."
Terror in Resonance,The North Water did just that. Colin Farell apparently jumped into the Arctic waters to test his mettle: https://www.radiotimes.com/tv/drama/the-north-water-filming-locations/
Terror in Resonance,"Plus, like.... you can tell, the outdoor shots don't look like they are outside at all"
Terror in Resonance,Breaking Jarred Harris or Ciaran Hinds' legs on the slippery ice is not a thing that should happen.
Terror in Resonance,The Tom Cruise method of film making.
Terror in Resonance,Have you seen The North Water? They filmed some parts of it further north than any scripted show before. Really solid and reminded me a lot of The Terror throughout. That genuine cold environment is hard to fake but they did a decent job. If the terror had been filmed outdoors in location that wouldve been perfecto
Terror in Resonance,"So before you found out, you thought it was not filmed indoors? That’s a fucking stupid reason."
Terror in Resonance,"Watching North Water now, there are a lot of similarities to The Terror S1, and if you like one you’ll probably like the other. 

But to me The Terror is clearly the better of the two."
Terror in Resonance,The Batman and Fabelman use the screen-wall tech in ways I am sure 99.9999% don't clock
Terror in Resonance,"Boba Fett (Mando) episode where they have a 'one-take' with Mando travelling across the city has been the best use of the volume I have seen, now they have mastered it."
Terror in Resonance,Also The Thing was shot outdoors in British Columbia
Terror in Resonance,Its a fantasy show - I think its better to have been shot in a studio then documentary style
Terror in Resonance,"No shit.

We had an MP murdered in broad daylight by a far right terrorist and everyone treated it as no big deal. 

If Boris was to lose an election, I wouldn't be surprised if a more successful recreation of the Jan 6 insurrection occurs"
Terror in Resonance,"Don't know the situation in the UK that well, but here in the USA, the right-wing violent types self-identify very clearly.  


They are the ones with Swastika flags, Trump hats, Confederate flags, semi-auto weapons, some which might have been illegally converted to full auto (one can't tell by looking), and they tend to yell slogans last heard at Nazi rallies, often chanting in the original German  (""Blut und Boden"" - ""Blood and Soil"", ""Jews will not replace us"", etc), and sometimes even engaging in Nazi salutes.

I honestly did Nazi that coming."
Terror in Resonance,"Eh I don't think it really means anything. Its just the writers wanting to subvert or play with audiences expectations in the hopes of creating a more interesting story.

I can point you to plenty of examples from British TV that ""took far right terrorists seriously"" if you like."
Terror in Resonance,"First off, in thqe show Slow Horses (which was exellent) the ""cooperation"" was coerced. They (the right-wing groups) would have lost credibility and become paraihas if they had not stop the plot. That was the reason why they tried to shut it down. Leadership involves taking into account public opinion with big picture activities like this show was demonstrating. The fact that the kidnappers were all involved in the kidnapping clearly demonstrate that each of the characters were not ""good guys"" and had personal issues. Some were sold on ""just going to scare"" idea and went along. Learn psychology and read about how extremists work. Often those not fully commits (to any cause) get roped in using this method and are stuck once they hit the point of no return. Even though the extremists did not want to kill the guy, they still stuck with it when greed was introduced (and the crazy guy pushing them all further down the road of martyrdom). So, no there were no good guys. 

False flag operations happen all the time by various groups, on all sides of any situation. A great recent one for the left in the US could be when Jussie Smollett lied about being attacked and blamed white males. I am sure with 5 more minutes of Google searching, I could find one committed by right wing, Islamic, Jewish, Whitestone Nationalist, Irish Catholoc, etc, etc. Your own political ideology really shows through here. Everyone sees what they want to see. Have fun in life believing that all Leftists are good and Right wing are evil and terrible. Sure to work out well for you."
Terror in Resonance,">This gives him vaugley left anti war motives 

What a weird take. Just because the motive wasn't what you thought it was, doesn't automatically excuses right wing terrorism, or even moves that character towards the left. 

That's some really misplaced binary thinking here. Terrorism is terrorism. Period."
Terror in Resonance,"What far right terrorism has there been in the UK that makes it's use as a plot in these two shows an attempt to ""weirdly"" downplay it?"
Terror in Resonance,[deleted]
Terror in Resonance,I somewhat disagree about *Slow Horses*. It is abundantly clear that the fascists are a threat even if the MI-5 second chair is trying to infiltrate and exploit them for political gain.
Terror in Resonance,">If Boris was to lose an election, I wouldn't be surprised if a more successful recreation of the Jan 6 insurrection occurs

This is absurd. Boris has given no indication that he would reject the results of a democratic election."
Terror in Resonance,">I wouldn't be surprised if a more successful recreation of the Jan 6 insurrection occurs

Bring it on! Plenty of people still remember what happened the last time the fascists tried to march through London."
Terror in Resonance,"“Far right”

That’s a funny way of spelling radicalised Muslim."
Terror in Resonance,"I really appreciate that you combined a valid, unarguable point, both educating and informative with an entertaining pun. Well done Internet stranger, you’ve got the perfect BBC triad. +500 points to you."
Terror in Resonance,"The reality is that the far right in Britain is essentially
dead. There are of course a small number of extremists who pose a violent threat to society but these are a tiny minority even amongst the declining far right. Even amongst the far right, their spokes people are careful to avoid saying outright racist things and use dog whistles to attract their followers. You wouldn’t see them using nazi salutes or carrying swastikas as they are generally the sons and grandsons of men who fought the Nazis. 

There was a time not long ago when the far right used to march in the streets but you don’t hear of these marches anymore. 

There are still many racists in Britain( like every country) but it’s no longer in the public eye.

Antisemitism isn’t something the British far right tend to engage in. The religion they dislike is Islam. Most people never meet Jews in their daily life so there is little interest in attacking them. The antisemitism tends to come from the left in Britain as many struggle to differentiate between Israel and other Jews. Britain’s major left wing party (Labour) have had a number of legal issues due to antisemitism within the party."
Terror in Resonance,"Don’t think it should have to be pointed out to you but from that second from last sentence it looks like someone has to:

The far right, as in Nazis, fascists, and white supremacists, *are* evil."
Terror in Resonance,"Yes, he's a terrorist. His motives, whatever they are don't absolve his actions. I'm sorry you got the impression that I think it's OK. My point is that that the right wing terror was perpetrated by someone who was not far right."
Terror in Resonance,Jo Cox' murder.
Terror in Resonance,Finsbury Park mosque attack.
Terror in Resonance,This is exactly my point. Except I believe this is wrong and bad. I'm glad we agree on what the messaging is.
Terror in Resonance,Garage threatened do exactly that if he lost the brexit vote
Terror in Resonance,The battle of Cable Street still is one of the few British historical moments I can be proud of.

Terror in Resonance,"No he meant radicalised conservatives, especially white conservatives."
Terror in Resonance,"Oh, don't worry, they hate Isalmic folks too.  They hate black, brown, yellow, freckled, and educated or cultured white people.  They hate anyone who is anything other than straight.  They even hate people who worship in SLIGHLTY different ways, such as Catholics, or anyone who is not an evangelistic type."
Terror in Resonance,"Did not say FAR right. Said right-wing. Which often includes conservative, some religious, some constitional advocates, etc. The FAR-anything, on any platform, is usually the extremists. If you think all right-wing (to include center and moderates) are evil nazi extremists then you are also part of the problem and effectively a Nazi of a different type."
Terror in Resonance,"You think a one incident from a lone wolf six years ago means that TV shows in 2022 not using right wing terror attacks as plots is an effort to ""weirdly downplay"" it as a threat?"
Terror in Resonance,"> You think one incident from a lone wolf five years ago means that TV shows in 2022 not using right wing terror attacks as plots is an effort to ""weirdly downplay"" it as a threat?"

"Its Okay, Thats Love",You watched nine seasons of a show you hated? Why?
"Its Okay, Thats Love","Being in the same genre =/= being of the same quality. 

The Last of Us is a great show so far, full stop. Wonderfully written/acted/paced/etc. Regardless of genre, it is just an incredibly high quality show. 

Will they fall prey to the same traps TWD did in latter seasons? Who knows? Who cares at this point?"
"Its Okay, Thats Love","The best way I can put it is ""focus"".

With most of the later Walking Dead episodes, the focus was a little scattered. You'd get a conversation here, a conversation there, a little action, but it felt a bit all over the place without any cohesion in the narrative or themes. It was a bit like a soap opera. The best episodes were the ones that would focus on something in particular. For example, there was a whole episode devoted to Eastman teaching Morgan how to fight with the bo staff. Those were the most engaging episodes.

That's what The Last of Us is doing right. It's focusing episodes around specific things that build up to something and not just scatter shot something resembling a narrative."

You need to go outside and breath in some fresh air."
"Its Okay, Thats Love","The problem with the Walking Dead wasn't really the plot itself. The problem was that it was stretched to 16 episodes per season with 8 episodes of plot because the network is greedy and strung it out for money. The problem was that the writing was painful with an acting core which really wasn't that good after they killed the best off in the first couple seasons. The problem was they were began trying to write dialogue and interweaving storylines like game of thrones in later seasons and failed miserably. 

TLOU will tell a complete story in one season. It's in the setting up stage. Still, the acting is much better and, when you know how this story ends, the smaller moments will mean a lot more to you on rewatch. If you don't like the payoff as the end of the season, feel free to have this take. As of now, you have to trust that the ride will be worth it."
"Its Okay, Thats Love","Spoiler, Joel doesn't get flown away in a helicopter.

I'm calling it now."
"Its Okay, Thats Love","The entire story of TLoU is out, just look it up and decide for yourself?

This is nothing like the Walking Dead. The Last of Us isn't going past 3 seasons."
"Its Okay, Thats Love","In The Walking Dead there never seemed to be a real overarching goal other than to survive and find and keep sanctuary. The main group would accomplish this until a new antagonist was introduced and the group had to fight them off or go somewhere else and start over.  


We are only a few episodes into The Last of Us but its already apparent what the goal is: Deliver Ellie to the Fireflies so they can hopefully research her immunity to find a cure. People that played the game will know what happens but at least an end goal is apparent and attainable. At this point its impossible for the show to go 9 seasons. It will not end up like the Walking Dead.  


I do think that there were characters introduced that gave me TWd vibes. Kathleen for example. Hopefully next episode will add some more context."
"Its Okay, Thats Love","Episode 4 is not a victim of this because Ellie/Joel character development is the story, and it unfolds beautifully with each episode.

And I won’t be the same because it’s:
a) a great existing story adapted beautifully 
b) showrunner is one of the best working on TV currently 

I wouldn’t worry if I were you"
"Its Okay, Thats Love",Well for starters HBO has decent writers and directors and they aren't going to make 20 episodes per season where basically nothing happens for 90% of the time. It will be 2 or max 3 seasons and they'll wrap it up.
"Its Okay, Thats Love","""hate watched the last nine seasons""

Who has the time to watch a show you don't like? I don't get it, but you do you."
"Its Okay, Thats Love","At some point people should probably learn the zombie genre is about character interaction primarily and almost exclusively. 

Apparently 11 years of twd wasn't enough. Maybe a few years of the last of us will be"
"Its Okay, Thats Love","I read the Walking Dead comic and played Part 1 of the Last of Us. 

These two shows are similar in their early seasons. Let's be real, we only got 4 episodes of The Last of Us. Most of those episodes had very little zombies. Which is fine, that's the point of these shows, to explore the human condition in a zombie plague. 

I loved the Walking Dead until they started being cowards. They wouldn't kill the big characters, they were afraid of losing viewers. That was the downfall IMO. Darryl needs to take the bat. That would make people watch, why? But everyone loves Darryl? Yeah but you have 3 seasons of Negan being alive and well. The crew could be after him for revenge. Anyways, that's not the point. 

The Last of Us has the same thing going for it, but now the creators have said they would stick to the game...ok we will see. But the few episodes we have seen, yeah this is going to be good if they keep it up. Milk it? 

Tell us the story of Joel in a spin-off. The 20 years that's missing. I'm watching every night."
"Its Okay, Thats Love","I agree, comparison with TWD is inevitable. I asked myself the other day, is it really different? I see similar situations plot wise. TWD used to be huge, now The Last of Us is huge."
"Its Okay, Thats Love",Yes they are very different
"Its Okay, Thats Love",Yes walking dead was stretched out garbage
"Its Okay, Thats Love","The Last of Us has a much bigger budget, and so won’t be forced to keep characters in one place for entire seasons at a time due to not having the money to build multiple big sets.  

Also, they won’t drag this show out longer than they need to.  The first game is the first season.  The second game looks set to be seasons two and three.  By that time, the third game will probably be out and they can go from there.  Unlike most networks, HBO historically has not pressured their creators to extend shows past their creative vision."
"Its Okay, Thats Love","Here's why your concerns are unwarranted

(1) The show is only going to run for three seasons. Hence it won't become stale and repetitive.

(2) The main cast is small. Literally two people. That may change in the future but I doubt it will blow up and become bloated like TWD. Joel and Elle should be in every episode and not disappear an come off as guest stars of the their own show."
"Its Okay, Thats Love","Conceptually, they aren't that different.  I don't agree with the people making strained arguments for how they're totally different.

They're primarily about genuine character relationships/interactions under the stress and tension of a post-apocalyptic world.

It's the execution that is potentially quite different.

At least in my case, I just grew tired of TWD and stopped really caring.  After a while, it just felt like ""why am I watching this?""  ""What's the point?""  As for how I got there, I would say the show led me to that point with its writing.

At least so far with The Last of Us, I still care.  In shows like TWD and The Last of Us, it's pretty important that you care about the characters.  It's the difference between character driven stories and plot driven stories.  You need good characters to be a character driven story.  What I think The Last of Us has done well so far is establish characters quickly with enough development while making them likable.  It's okay if the episodes are development heavy if you actually care about the characters just as much as their journey / the plot."
"Its Okay, Thats Love","TWD and Last of us are very very different stories. That they both have 'zombies' is almost inconsequential. I want to avoid saying more due to spoilers, but I'll say the TWD is a zombie story, even the comics. The Last of Us is not a zombie story, zombies just exist in the story."
"Its Okay, Thats Love",This post reminds me of the r/overwatch subreddit where they pour hundreds of hours into a game they don’t enjoy and come on Reddit to let people know as if they give a shit lol
"Its Okay, Thats Love","
But what do we have in the Last of Us?  Episode 2, they got slightly further. Episode 3, excellent character story but at the end the only development was the acquisition of some more guns (Walking Dead haters would have downvoted the episode into oblivion).  

Just to prove you wrong I hate the walking dead and I loved episode 3.

But genuinely, you seem to have missed the entire point of The Last of Us. 

The show isn’t *about* the apocalypse. It’s about the people in it, and how they find each other and form strong bonds and connections in a world that tries its best to destroy every last ounce of hope. Joel even states multiple times throughout the first four episodes that he doesn’t really fear or care about the “zombies”. It’s the people he fear. Hopeless people who will do anything they can to survive one more day. 

> Episode 4, we got a little further.     

You watched four episodes of the show, where the main plot point is “get Ellie from point A to point B and you complain that they’re….. getting further to point B?

> I'm just curious, me and the rest of the world hated the last 9 seasons of the Walking Dead because of the overabundance of character development and the lack of plot development.  

I hated it because it had little to no character development, relied on self grandiose characters and little to no plot, shocking scenes for the sake of shock and a near mindless attitude towards where the plot was going. 

> Four episodes in and The Last of Us has already become a victim of this.    

You aren’t watching the last of us if you think this. 

> How many episodes until Joel gets flown away in a helicopter and we never hear from him again?     

If you don’t like it, don’t watch it. I genuinely do not understand why you would bother watching a show that’s clearly neither meant for you, nor one that you’re able to “get”. Which is fine, but you don’t need to make a point out of it. Just stop watching."
"Its Okay, Thats Love","I think the difference is hope.  What do the characters in Walking Dead hope for? Just another day? 

In Last of Us, there is hope in a cure. And I think that’s what keeps them going in a different kind of way"
"Its Okay, Thats Love","I agree 100% about Walking Dead:  It stopped being scifi or even horror and became just an endless survivalist slog.  I have not been interested in \_The Last of Us\_ because I am so turned off by the whole genre now, but I've heard such good things about it that I have been on the fence about trying it..."
"Its Okay, Thats Love","I can't hate watch nine episodes, let alone nine seasons. Hot damn"
"Its Okay, Thats Love",It’s very intricately different… lol
"Its Okay, Thats Love","As someone who’s played the games, keep watching."
"Its Okay, Thats Love","Yes, unlike The Walking Dead, The Last of US is great."
"Its Okay, Thats Love",">I'm just curious, me and the rest of the world hated the last 9 seasons of the Walking Dead 

Rest of the world did not hate the last 9 seasons lol

>because of the overabundance of character development and the lack of plot development.  Four episodes in and The Last of Us has already become a victim of this.

I get the feeling you don’t understand the point of these shows. It would be best to stay away from them."
"Its Okay, Thats Love",TWD was never a good show. Boring characters and absolutely terrible writing.
"Its Okay, Thats Love",The walking dead in later seasons had a young black woman who somehow kept a perfectly managed fade in the middle of the fucking wilderness and apocalypse. the attention to detail makes a world of difference.
"Its Okay, Thats Love","The difference is The Walking Dead is a soap opera, that's what Kirkman set out to create, it's about communitys and the injection of drama into them, TLOU is a character study, it has communities but they aren't the focus, rather the journey of a few characters is.

Now I love TWD comic but it's very true that it got into a routine of find a community, destroy it move to the next, with each arc it becomes a look into these communities how they form and what it takes to tear them down, TLOU is different in that each game is the arc, there's a journey across the country but its not about establishing and destroying communities, it's about fostering a bond and then raising a question, exactly how much does that bond mean?

I think the set dressing is going to feel similar, because it's post apocalyptic zombie adjacent, if you spend all your time trying to create something unique in that space that makes sense there won't be time to focus on the elements that make it good, so yes there's different communities around the world but how the narrative interacts with is different because its not the soap opera that TWD set out to be."
"Its Okay, Thats Love","What a shit title and take.

>Vince Gilligan could've solved these issues in two episodes.

As a Breaking Bad fan, I cringed when you mentioned Vince.

>me and the rest of the world hated the last 9 seasons of the Walking Dead because of the overabundance of character development and the lack of plot development.

And you think it got 9 seasons beyond your taste because people hated it? I loved TWD, though I hate almost everything post-Rick, and he was there until Season 9. I did not hate the character development at all... I still don't understand why you feel so entitled to claim the world shares your opinion? It seems to me you're just a Left 4 Dead fan who wanted a Left 4 Dead show...

>Episode 3, excellent character story but at the end the only development was the acquisition of some more guns

Tell me this is satire...

>How many episodes until Joel gets flown away in a helicopter and we never hear from him again?

This is satire, isn't it? This happens in the next episode. Ellie then goes around girl bossing people left and right until she meets a Brother in Christ that straightens her up. /s"
"Its Okay, Thats Love",TWD has more interesting characters.
"Its Okay, Thats Love","Can’t say I understand hate watching at all, but personally I don’t like the walking dead and am loving the last of us."
"Its Okay, Thats Love","You are not wrong. The Last of Us is a good show, as TWD has been for several seasons. And there's nothing extraordinary about TLoU, other than an efficient marketing machine. Again, it's a good show, nothing new or surprising. It's not a demerit, actually. Perhaps this sub has been watching little TV for the last 2 years and being surprised by anything."
"Its Okay, Thats Love","Um, zombies currently aren’t the focus? Walking Dead had just an endless supply and they were all over just about every episode."
"Its Okay, Thats Love",Feels exactly the same. Will stop after the first season like walking dead.
"Its Okay, Thats Love",I love comics (Invincible and Saga are 2 of my favs) but the last of us game is so much more popular are reached so many more people.  Had HBO picked up TWD and cut all the fat that AMC/Gimple bloated TWD with I believe it would have been a completely different show.  It’s almost as if two great stories can vary wildly in quality when brought to screen by different producers.
"Its Okay, Thats Love","I've hardly seen any zombies/mushroom people. So yes, it's different."
"Its Okay, Thats Love",yeah
"Its Okay, Thats Love","Why did you ""hate watch"" *nine seasons* of a TV show? I don't think you hate it at that point."
"Its Okay, Thats Love","The Walking Dead would have benefited from a 8-10 episode person season format. Regardless of what people say, imo, was good up until the end of season 6 when they ended it with Negan killing someone and us not knowing. The Whisperers made it interesting again too. So they could've cut a lot of filler episodes and the show would still be considered one of the better shows of the last decade. Also, HBO just cranks out great content. The Walking Dead almost was going to be on HBO too. But we may not have gotten GoT."
"Its Okay, Thats Love",It’s similar to well-written episodes of TWD from the early seasons before it became silly and even more over the top
"Its Okay, Thats Love","Gave up on Walking Dead at around season 6/7. 

My wife pushed on through to the end and now wants me to start on TLoU, and I gotta say I am just not interested in the LEAST.

I didn't play the game either, even though I'm a video game guy. I am just sick to death of the genre."
"Its Okay, Thats Love","I’ve just been reflecting on this. If walking dead was about the main and his son just traveling around, there would be no difference at all. Actually one of the major failings of TWD was the large ensemble to track. Structurally and content wise they’re the same"
"Its Okay, Thats Love",I watched season 1 of WD and thought it was boring and uninteresting. None of the characters were developed. And the zombies were generic. The characters make or break story for me and I never connected with them. Last of Us is the characters. They are the most important aspects to the story.
"Its Okay, Thats Love","The game is, the tv show? Not so much. More gayness, but otherwise yeah it’s a case of wash rinse repeat."
"Its Okay, Thats Love",TLOU has 3 seasons worth of story. So it wont overstay his welcome like TWD.
"Its Okay, Thats Love","Well there’s only two games, without getting into spoilers - both have very definitive endings and make big, bold narrative choices. Mazin has said Season 1 is Game 1 and Season 2 will adapt Game 2. He also has said that he hates filler, and based on the first four episodes that seems to be true. I guess what I’m saying is this show is going to make big points and do them faster than most shows. I’d be surprised if the show goes longer than 3 seasons. At the most, it’ll be 5 if they end up releasing a Last of Us: Part III"
"Its Okay, Thats Love","I wound up watching TWD to find out (1) what caused the zombies; and (2) whether it could be cured.  Late on, this turned into watching begrudgingly, when I realized it was never going to happen. 

I got that from the 1st episode in TLOU."
"Its Okay, Thats Love","Because we know exactly where it’s going. The pacing feels right when you have a general sense of how much is supposed to happen, which is something TWD could’ve never had with its audience. 

There’s a huge amount of people who are watching this knowing what to expect - and wanting them to slow down to take time to maybe expand a bit more.

I can also understand the audience who haven’t played the games getting frustrated at the slower pacing, but I hope you get to see how this really builds out the world and develops the characters more than we’d typically see in this genre. Ultimately what made the game so successful in 2013 was it succeeded *despite* the genre. In a time where we had new “zombie” content everywhere the characters and storytelling really set this apart to win over people who otherwise wouldn’t have given it a second look.

Coming from a very recent game also gives the producers a huge advantage. We already know the plot, setting, characters, concept art, how things should look, how the characters should sound and behave. Hell, we even have most of the staging blocked out like it was already a movie. While it could be seen as limiting, to me this has given them so much relief to essentially turn in a “newer draft” of the script they’d already written. We get things expanded that needed clarification, adapted to slow or speed up the pace where necessary, etc. I think that’s just such a unique position to be in because other adapted works are working with much, much less material and have to spend so much more time creating the world."
"Its Okay, Thats Love",1 episode showing a high-quality character arc beats mediocre character arcs milked to death for 20 episodes a season.
"Its Okay, Thats Love",Episode 4 showed a lot. TLOU isn't about zombies. It's about Joel and Ellie. You are looking at the show wrong.
"Its Okay, Thats Love","Patience, young padawan"
"Its Okay, Thats Love","No one will have a conversation about the last of us 2 plot. I’ve tried. People either hate it, or love it to death. I do not like the story. If you’ve seen walking dead seasons 6-8. The last of us season 2 will be very familiar lol"
"Its Okay, Thats Love","They are very similar, and even the conceit of the plot of TLOU is not very original: ""Get immune person to someone who can science a cure,"" but I think the devil is in the details, it's crafted with extreme care and very high quality."
"Its Okay, Thats Love","Honestly, yes. They are different shows, and that’ll become more clear as it goes along."
"Its Okay, Thats Love","The rabid fans won't admit it, but this show will fall into the TWD pattern as episodes go on. The stories aren't carbon copy, but TWD had a great start as well. 

The fans will tell you TLoU isn't about the walkers or clickers, but what was TWD after a couple of seasons. TWD was about human condition and savagery. Guess what will happen in TLoU."
"Its Okay, Thats Love",To build himself up to hate another show and tell us all about it
"Its Okay, Thats Love","The show did a pretty good job at having 1-2 good episodes per season that would keep you coming back with a small amount of hope they might turn it around.  Usually the season premiere and finale were worthy, rest was trash."
"Its Okay, Thats Love","Yeah, that shit always puzzles me.

I also got to the point where I wasn't enjoying the walking dead anymore, but I watched like 3 or 4 episodes pass that point. I sure as hell didn't keep watching the entire thing. Why when there is so much else I can be doing?"
"Its Okay, Thats Love",This man is fueled on pure spite.
"Its Okay, Thats Love","I wonder if they really did hate-watch it, or they want hide the fact that they watched it so as to not go against consensus."
"Its Okay, Thats Love",Especially considering seasons 1-6 and 9-11 of Walking Dead are considered good to phenomenal tv. Maybe a sign one doesn’t like the genre if they hate watched the strong seasons
"Its Okay, Thats Love","Honestly, I liked the first few seasons enough that I thought it might get back on track at some point. By maybe season 8 it was more of 'well, I've come this far...' There were a few good episodes mixed in and the acting was always solid but they needed to take more chances in the writing room.  I had hope.  It didn't pay off."
"Its Okay, Thats Love","They won't, the story for the second game (what will be season 2/3 ) is very different from the first game.

It'll stay fresh because there will be things that take the focus away from just Joel and Ellie in season 2/3."
"Its Okay, Thats Love","In all fairness, TWD lost the creator in the middle of the second season and he took a couple key actors with him. 

I doubt that’ll happen here and I still don’t understand why TWD gained popularity after the obvious loss in quality."
"Its Okay, Thats Love","To continue with your point, the episode where Eastman teaches Morgan was great, but it was received horribly when it was released. Not because it was a bad episode, but because they put it right after a needless cliffhanger death fake-out, so it killed any pacing that the season had."
"Its Okay, Thats Love",But take off your aluminum helmet first...
"Its Okay, Thats Love","In fairness to OP, many of the old default subs are overrun with bots, marketing, and astroturfing accounts, plus they are good spots to do bot testing since the high volume of users, posts, and such, and are lightly moderated. A bunch of old bot makers used to use all the entertainment based subs to juice their bots and configure them and such.

Not saying OP is right here, and I do not think OP is right, but I get the sentiment. HBO however, hasn't ever really seemed to need to juice here, unlike Apple TV+, who may be the worst offender."
"Its Okay, Thats Love",That comment is hilarious.
"Its Okay, Thats Love",You don't think corps game the algorithm? Lol
"Its Okay, Thats Love","Trying to explain to OP that zombies are not the plot, just a feature in a post-apocalyptic setting: GIVE ME GOD OF REDDIT difficulty."
"Its Okay, Thats Love","> Well for starters HBO has decent writers and directors

I mean, TWD certainly had that for a long time as well.

I mean, the first two episodes were directed by Frank Darabont and Michelle MacLaren (who directed a bunch of Breaking Bad and Game of Thrones along with Westworld, Better Call Saul, and The Leftovers). S1 also had Ernest Dickerson, who directed a bunch of The Wire and Treme."
"Its Okay, Thats Love","Yeah. I don’t get how we’re this far in to the zombie genre and people still think the zombies are important. They aren’t. They’re a plot device to make people interact in a new way. No one cares about the zombies, we care about what people do in that situation"
"Its Okay, Thats Love","Respect the take. Also respect the flair. I'm 40 and grew up with Beavis and Butthead.  Was sad to find Do The Universe is on the one streaming platform I don't have.     
On a related note, told my co-worker today that I was going to buy the Last of Us and start playing it tonight.  I have an Xbox One and a Switch.  Didn't know it was Playstation exclusive.  Between that and the hundred hate messages I received because of this post, not a great online day overall."
"Its Okay, Thats Love","> At least so far with The Last of Us, I still care

You stopped caring for TWD in less than 4 episodes?"
"Its Okay, Thats Love",Nah TWD is definitely supposed to be about the characters more than the zombies. The writing is just horrible on that show
"Its Okay, Thats Love","TWD is not a ""zombie story"", especially in the comics.

""The Walking Dead"" are the people, not the zombies.

"Its Okay, Thats Love","This is super revisionist. TWD has bad seasons but trying to argue it was never good is simply laughable. 

The hate circlejerk has gone way farther here than expected. Its kind of asinine"
"Its Okay, Thats Love","You don't think The Walking Dead could've benefited from having Vince Gilligan in the writer's room?      
I always thought it somewhat hypocritical when people hated on the ""character development"" episodes for being slow despite the fact that most people originally liked it because it seemed like a realistic take on a zombie apocalypse.     
Life isn't always fast paced.  It's often boring and banal (not that I always want to watch it) but it helps add a bit of realism.  But I see Vince Gilligan as a master of conflict and conflict resolution (the Tuco problem eg.).  Had TWD taken lessons from him they could've stopped retreading old storylines and done something unique.  Jeffrey Dean Morgan is a solid actor but he certainly outstayed his welcome on the show.     
Your vitriol is potent, but as a fellow Breaking Bad fan, I cannot disrespect your opinion."
"Its Okay, Thats Love",Last of Us 2 at least makes sense in terms of what happened in Last of Us 1. Don’t know if you can say the same about helicopter…
"Its Okay, Thats Love",Well that's the reason for Reddit right?
"Its Okay, Thats Love","I also felt like they knew really well how to end episodes, lots of the episodes would end in a really compelling way that would make me forget how trash the first 40 minutes always were."
"Its Okay, Thats Love","What is this? Revisionism?

Season 2, with all the filler episodes at the farmhouse, showed how absolutely terrible the show was capable of being. And it previewed the rot lying ahead of us. They repeated the same terrible formula in season 3.

Half of season 4 showed how it was capable of being good after all, and then things just went from worse to worse.

Good to phenomenal? I don't believe so."
"Its Okay, Thats Love","Bots and astroturfing definitely can be a problem, but a negative post about a successful show isn't worth anybody's time.

Not even the time of an intern who works for HBO Max.

Trying to boost the popularity of a show is one thing, but nobody cares a single person comparing a successful show with another successful show."
"Its Okay, Thats Love",Apple doesn't hold a candle to Disney's astroturfing. The Andor spam was fucking relentless for a couple of months
"Its Okay, Thats Love",*laughs in Amazon Prime*
"Its Okay, Thats Love",Exactly. Zombies are the backdrop.   But that’s not what makes The Last of Us work.
"Its Okay, Thats Love","Sure, the first season was good. That was like, what, 6 episodes? If you only watch that and ignore the other garbage seasons then sure, it was a good show."
"Its Okay, Thats Love","Hate messages are completely unnecessary but you definitely tried to throw something great into a box because you are unfamiliar with it. I'm not sure if I'd recommend playing the game since you haven't already because you will definitely know how the show will end. You will also appreciate every episode it takes to get there a lot more though. Completely your call but having played the game and knowing how it ends, this show is master class and I'm glad they aren't letting us binge it but damn I want to binge it just like I did the game when it came out. Bought it Friday night of release and had it beat by Saturday afternoon."
"Its Okay, Thats Love","I saw someone say the last of us show already had a far better legacy than twd... lol

"Its Okay, Thats Love","That's not what I implied.  Given the length of TWD, it would be a stretch to assume ""after a while"" would be in less than 4 episodes."
"Its Okay, Thats Love","Not really, even the comic its really zombie-centric most of the time. Its much more of a zombie survival scenario, then about the characters."
"Its Okay, Thats Love","Playing the game will spell out that this isn't just a Zombie show. It's about the relationship between it's characters, primarily Joel and Ellie. It's about them and their journey to help one another etc. TWD is just a gore-fest."
"Its Okay, Thats Love","I'm guessing you don't know TLOU story? Or TWD story. They are very very different.

Its like saying Star Wars and Star Trek are the same because they are both in space with laser guns"
"Its Okay, Thats Love","I may have misread your personality based on your post: you do seem like a reasonable person.

No, I don't think Vince Giligan would've made it any better. The Walking Dead (show) doesn't work around ""realism"" as such. It works around the Post-Apocalypse.

There are many stages for an ""after humanity"" story.

Apocalypse: Resident Evil, Left 4 Dead, Fear The Walking Dead (First season). It's all going downhill and people are running, trying to find a way to go back to normal, to stop it or to ""survive the night"".

Post-Apocalypse: The Walking Dead (S2-S6), Fallout (except for New Vegas). The world as we know it ended. Period. No going back (though they do try to in Season 1), only moving forward. This type of apocalypse is where people are trying to survive daily, trying to find a way to live that doesn't involve a nomadic life style.

Post-Post-Apocalypse: The Walking Dead (S7-S11), Fallout New Vegas. Time to rebuild societies. Humanity can survive daily without worrying too much about food, water, etc. The world isn't back on its feet, but it's back on baby steps.

&#x200B;

Now, the point is: The Walking Dead (show) wasn't necessarily ABOUT the post-apocalypse, but about how humanity, how society, would work IN it. You can see Shane losing his mind over the leadership, with Rick-Lori drama in between, as a ""character drama"", but it's actually something greater than that. It's about the rules, it's about what's right and what's wrong, it's about how society doesn't function the same way it did before (where killing was straght-up bad) yet you still need it to keep the sanity of the people.

Rick tries his best to stick to the old ways, and that's why so many people do him wrong. So many people choosing the ""easy way"" because, like Negan said in ""Here's Negan"", now 'Seeing Red' isn't a matter of what's wrong and what's right. It's a matter of what you can do.

The show constantly throws lots of drama that could relate to characters being characters, but it's meant as Food for Thought. In a similar vein to Walter in S1, handling the situation with Krazy-8. ""What choice is there? How could I handle this?""

Vince Giligan has a way of building up the conflict and such, but I don't believe he could handle a fantasy show where the conflict isn't in the characters but in the group.

I do love Breaking Bad way more than The Walking Dead, but, same as BrBa, I suggest you watch TWD not as a ""zombie show"" but as a ""re-construction and deconstruction of society"" show, where the main issue is not ""to kill or not to kill"", but ""where do we draw the line of what's right and wrong?"". (Everything after Rick went was kinda trash for me, though. I didn't like it)."
iCarly,Hilary Duff wants an adult Lizzie doing adult things.  Disney wants Hilary doing mom things for a kids show.  I don't see it happening
iCarly,"I know nobody cares about it but me, but can Disney write a proper ending to Phil of The Future, please.

It's a time travel show so the fact that it ended on a cliffhanger 15 years ago doesn't matter."
iCarly,"I'm upset that Amanda Bynes is mentally unwell, because an Amanda Show reboot would be fucking fire. 

Bring in the dancing lobsters 🦞🦞"
iCarly,Drake and Josh can’t happen cuz Drake is a crazy person. Zoey 101 was on the brink then Jamie is apparently feeding off her sisters censorship. I hope they bring back certain cast members of Victrious like the willing ones and Lizzie
iCarly,Let Lizzie Fuck.
iCarly,##LetLizzyMcGuireFuck
iCarly,Now for the Kenan and Kell reboot.
iCarly,"Interesting to me that whatever they did in the first two episodes wasn't family friendly enough. The Disney+ show ""Diary of a Female President"" - which I actually watched and enjoyed - addresses menstruation, being gay-curious, teen couples discussing touching each other, and other coming-of-age topics that could be considered ""not family friendly."""
iCarly,"I hope this continues with a break from 2024-2034 and picking up with iCarly as a middle aged woman heading up a digital studio, then another break from 2038-2048 and a 4th reboot with her at the head of a digital network like Netflix, followed by a 5th reboot when she's 68 years old and in a millenial-themed retirement home. 


I am zero percent kidding. Let's do this."
iCarly,Give me a Pete & Pete reboot/revival.
iCarly,I don’t understand why they haven’t done this already. Having an adult oriented reboot that follows Lizzie as she navigates her 30’s should be money in the bank.
iCarly,"I fucking loved the new Icarly reboot much more than I should have. It would have been better if Jeannette joined in, but I get it."
iCarly,[deleted]
iCarly,Can we just bring back salute your shorts
iCarly,"Gordo crushed that Lizzie probably dumped shortly after starting high school. He became a successful tech entrepreneur , has one asian gf after another, but secretly desires Lizzie. 

Tudgeman became ridiculously handsome and Lizzie ends up with him. 

Lizzie went into advertising, ended up with Tudgeman

Miranda became a dancer, mostly in music videos, then transitioned into choreography. no successful personal life. 

Lizzie's brother enlisted in the army, had great aptitude, was recruited by the CIA, then became a mercenary hitman - his latest target : Gordo. 

Kate got knocked up in college, moved back home, remained a townie. 

Ethan became a model then was on a hit tv show briefly before being written off and never recovered. His accountant stole most of his money. Ethan now works in a surf shop."
iCarly,They need to talk to Shia Labeouf about an Even Stevens reboot so we cld get Beans his own spinoff
iCarly,So how did Miranda Cosgrove stay so level-headed and scandal free after iCarly?
iCarly,I had the biggest crush on her
iCarly,They’ve already reskinned what that show was supposed to be into the how I met your father reboot
iCarly,they wouldn’t do the lizzie mcguire show because disney thought it was too grown up. i really hope with the direction paramount+ is going influences disney+
iCarly,I think Hillary Duff is going to be the star in a How I Met Your Mother spin-off “How I Met Your Father”.
iCarly,I agree. I haven't really watched the new iCarly show but I've seen clips and it's exactly what I want from these shows that are being brought back.
iCarly,"Let Lizzie fuck 

I wanna see an adult Lizzie"
iCarly,"Me too, Hillary Duff got a whole bakery in the basement🍑"
iCarly,I want “You can’t do that on Televison” and mother fucking “Wishbone” rebooted. Except Wishbone is a Bull terrier who does bully spins when he catches the murderer. Yeah adult Wishbone CSI. 😉
iCarly,"I don't have a good place to put this, so I just want to let everyone know that Hilary Duff wrote a series of young adult novels and they're awful.

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elixir_(Duff_and_Allen_novel)"
iCarly,"🎶Rob Iger, bring all my bitches back🎶"
iCarly,Let lizzie mcguire fuck.
iCarly,That would be so sickkkkkk
iCarly,We need an Alex Mack reboot
iCarly,Can we get a middle aged Clarissa Explains It All? Or maybe a Salute Your Shorts?
iCarly,Lizzie McGuire a Brazzers production
iCarly,Doesn't Boy Meets World have adult themes? They did muck up Girl Meets World though. Boy Meets World is an excellent example of what to do when they start growing up in college.
iCarly,"Fuck it, give me Holes 2 with Shia LaBeouf"
iCarly,What about instead of reboots they just MAKE GOOD FUCKING SHIT AGAIN jfc
iCarly,Adult Pete and Pete please
iCarly,Give us what we all want: an adult Even Stevens reboot. That show was always better than Lizzie McGuire.
iCarly,"Both of them were very interesting on Whitney Cummings' *Good for You* podcast. Really didn't expect to like them after tbh.

[Ep #47: HILARY DUFF | Good For You Podcast with Whitney Cummings](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kR3gCyr7IdE)

[Ep #41: MIRANDA COSGROVE | Good For You Podcast with Whitney Cummings](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yb6OWBE9uiY)"
iCarly,Unfortunately it looks like adult TV is “let’s get drunk”
iCarly,I’m distracted by the fact that Miranda Cosgrove feels the need to Facetune herself.
iCarly,"Dan schnider, bring all my bitches back"
iCarly,"I *really* want a Ned’s Declassified School Survival Guide reboot, pretty fucking please."
iCarly,Here I was hoping that the remake craze was phasing out...
iCarly,We need a drake and jo.... oh wait
iCarly,I guess no one has new ideas for shows anymore. Lets just reboot everything.
iCarly,"Haha 80% of all content is not OC

How innovative of crapitalism, selling us nostalgia ad finity"
iCarly,"Meh, it would be like the full house reboot or the iCarly reboot. 

A “oh my god I loved this when I was a kid” sort of thing - watch half of one episode…and turn it off because it’s not interesting"
iCarly,That so raven did well. Not sure why they want to curse and add sex so bad.
iCarly,They got a few seasons out of girl meets world. Don't know what they are so hesitant about.
iCarly,Too bad Sam won't be back too.
iCarly,I think the acting in the new iCarly by Miranda Cosgrove is not has genuine. Am I the only one that believes that? I turned tht shit off after the first episode. Sam the character should have came back but I respect her decision to stop acting.
iCarly,Who the fuck is the market for this shit?
iCarly,Lol you don’t tell the mouse what to do
iCarly,"""Adult"" version?"
iCarly,iHorny
iCarly,Wish they would stop with the reboots
iCarly,"Who even wants this?  The whole point of the show was about a girl figuring out the transition from child to teenager.  The problems Lizzy had could be portrayed in a light hearted way because teenage girls typically made mountains out of mole hills.

What hyjinks is adult Lizzie going to go through?  Trying to buy a house in a bubble market while cartoon Lizzy reminds her of rapidly growing inflation rates?"
iCarly,No Jeanette McCurdy so thats a no from me dawg
iCarly,Adult reboot?? Why? No one is looking for this trash
iCarly,Oh god please no...
iCarly,Fuck Disney+. Put that on HBO Max. Plz.
iCarly,Miranda lookin fire in that pic tho
iCarly,They are beautiful ♥️
iCarly,iCarly is still around?
iCarly,">She explained that she had around ""50,000"" hours of calls with the cast

Really? 50,000 hours is almost 6 years 24/7 on calls."
iCarly,Sadly Disney is the most that is run by out of touch puritans (which make me worried for She-Hulk and X-Men). Though there a lot of out of touch puritans in the industry with some of them being pedos.
iCarly,How about no.
iCarly,……please no
iCarly,I will not let my kids watch unless Lizzie is literally a nun!!!
iCarly,"I doubt it ""prostitots"" are Disney's bread and butter."
iCarly,i dont understand the need to make adult versions of kids shows
iCarly,Doubt it new I Carly ruins the old show
iCarly,[deleted]
iCarly,Your time was 20 years ago. You’re both irrelevant now just fade into oblivion pls zzzzzzzzzz
iCarly,"This is why I hate mcu having rights to most everything marvel now..

The will never be able to top the Netflix marvel runs.+

Also why I didnt enjoy the last avengers flick as most did.. because that was not THANOS.
Thanos would never shed a tear. Thanos wants everyone and everything dead.
He started as a child killing small animals to impress his imaginary gf..who was actually death..he eventually killed his own mother and father and his entire home planet. He is a insanely powerful serial killer.

Disney could never do thanos justice.

What Disney does right is stuff like the mandalorian because its from scratch made to fit cannon.

Meanwhile marvel stuff mostly  they destroy the relatively to the actual source especially when it comes to villains.

I mean if they wont do a show like this how the hell can we expect them to do justice to certain characters in the future. 
Loki was okay but he is a character you can play with like that.

I think eventually they will end up hurting themselves as far as comic related stuff goes..

And losing out to shows like invincible..and the boys that stay true to the creators. 

Unless they spin off an additional service for more money with more adult orientated content which is something they have done before."
iCarly,No way! I wouldn’t even call Hillary Duff an actress because her ‘acting’ is so horrible. I mean male your skin crawl bad. It almost ruined gossip girl for me. Now I can’t stop thinking about it.
iCarly,Why wouldn’t they? It’s easy money
iCarly,Yes plz
iCarly,Or have Hilary duff do some sort of original programming.
iCarly,Weren’t they supposed to?
iCarly,Why would it? It’s not like the Icarly reboot is a big success.
iCarly,Hellooooo eyebrows
iCarly,I remember loving Lizzie McQuire as a kid. It truly would be a trip to see a grown up version now. I’d watch it
iCarly,Where’s that crossover
iCarly,I'm pretty sure Brazzers already did.
iCarly,They already said no :/
iCarly,Take my money Disney+
iCarly,Plz no
iCarly,"She had 50,000 hours of calls?? That's nearly 6 years straight of being on the phone....

Edit: a word"
iCarly,"Sounds to me like she wants a taste of that sweet, sweet nostalgia money."
iCarly,It's probably not going to happen for a long time unless How I Met Your Father gets cancelled.
iCarly,"""Celebrity hope something will happen"" isn't news."
iCarly,I have really liked the icarly reboot. It’s funny and cheesy but very perfect for a reboot for adults.
iCarly,THIS THREAD IS SENDING ME DOWN MEMORY LANE OMG
iCarly,"Can we bring back cousin skeeter but with no puppets!? And we're  all clamoring for 100 deeds for eddie McDowell but with no dog. Hey can we do a live action kablam for 30 year olds? Hey let's do alex mac but she doesn't turn to silver puddle, shes just an older millenial doing adult stuff, ya know!"
iCarly,Would love updated salute your shorts. Also revised format and updated are you afraid of the dark. I know they technically did reboot but the format isn’t at all the same.
iCarly,Who cares? Your career was at a standstill so you went back to the lowest common denominator
iCarly,"Well, now that she’s signed on for “How I Met Your Father”, I doubt any of that will take place sadly.

Still excited for HIMYF… I hope it’s the “adult girl learning the adult world” type of show she wanted for the Lizzie reboot."
iCarly,Hilary duff ahh she was hot !
iCarly,The iCarly reboot was actually good! My friend and I loved it
VeggieTales in the House,"thats the craziest shit ever, i watched them on vhs when i was a kid"
VeggieTales in the House,Phil Vischer recently put out a pretty good video explaining [the basics of white privilege.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGUwcs9qJXY)
VeggieTales in the House,"Why does this seem to bother some of you folks? I mean, whats wrong with black talent portraying black characters in animation?"
VeggieTales in the House,"Do people not know that DarthVader who is white is voiced by James Earl Jones a black man? Why didn’t people go after him for voicing someone outside his race?

Or how Kevin Michael Richardson voiced Joker in the 2004 Batman who was also white (not just bleached skin we do see him before the chemicals and he’s a white guy)

The whole point of acting is to be someone else. People shouldn’t prevent actors from playing characters simply based on race"
VeggieTales in the House,"it feels regressive, to me, to require that the ethnicity of the cartoon match that of the actor voicing it. Isn't it easy to imagine a white nationalist making this same demand--'whites should only voice white characters'

I also wonder if this would lead to less diverse casts. Jenny Slate and Allison Brie were 2 high profile examples of white actors voicing non-white characters. I'm guessing that the creators of those shows were more invested in having those actors than they were in those characters being non-white."
VeggieTales in the House,Maybe because it’s a fucking vegetable?
VeggieTales in the House,"Another way to write this headline 
“HBO had the biggest hits on TV for 2nd consecutive year”"
VeggieTales in the House,"HBO needs to teach their movie counterparts (WB) the importance of screenwriters, because they’re the ones responsible for delivering quality! HOTD and TLOU are so damn good!"
VeggieTales in the House,Maybe this will make execs notice you should be hiring writers who love your ip and not writers who hate it/just use it as a vehicle for their own shit ideas.
VeggieTales in the House,"Sony to Neil be like ""please make part 3, we have consoles to sell & more money to make!"""
VeggieTales in the House,"I knew it!

&#x200B;

Second season, just like Dragon, is gonna be huge, man HBO just doesn't miss."
VeggieTales in the House,"Well deserved.

I for one am so happy they didn't mess with the story.  Too many adaptations just do lip service to the source material and end up being completely different.  This just upsets the existing fanbase, especially when the adaptation is bad to boot.    Here they had a stellar story and didn't mess with it often recreating scenes that were near identical to the game.    It was so awesome seeing it come to life without significant changes other than cutting things for brevity.    

Here's hoping they do the second game similar justice as it's story is just as worthy of being adaptated straight up though I can see how they might tinker with way they tell the story in that they'll show the stories of the dual protagonists at the same time rather than separately."
VeggieTales in the House,"Discovery really underestimated HBO, I hope this means that they aren't going to try and control more in the merger and still take risks on shows."
VeggieTales in the House,"You know what's the best feeling in the world after every good news about this show? 

It's knowing that the salt mine that is The Last of Us 2 subreddit are seething with hate. Absolutely love it. 

Good news. Can't wait for season 2."
VeggieTales in the House,"HBO needs to pick up the Witcher man, which they won’t do because they have Westeros, but I still dream of what could have been"
VeggieTales in the House,"TLOU is a rare example of a big production team having respect and understanding for the source material. Most of the time, Hollywood follows the business model of  taking a generic script and sticking a known IP in it to gain publicity (see- Halo TV)."
VeggieTales in the House,"I played the game a couple times. Once on ps3 and then ps4. But I didn’t it so long ago I was able to watch the show and not know exactly what was going to happen scene to scene or what was change or the same. The game definitely has you feeling more attached to Ellie and Joel together as you play as Joel and it’s your job to keep Ellie safe. So some of the stuff in the show didn’t hit the same. Also, I found when I played the game I sided with Joel almost fully. Like he was doing the the wrong thing for the right reasons. But being removed from controlling him and watching it play out on a tv show, I feel I got the intended effect. And it definitely makes Last of Us part II more obvious how that plays out."
VeggieTales in the House,"Damn. This is impressive.

Imagine how Halo show could’ve been if they actually respected the lore."
VeggieTales in the House,The writing has been superb.
VeggieTales in the House,"I liked TLOU wayyy more than HOTD and I’m saying this as someone who loves GOT and who didn’t play the TLOU game.

TLOU felt way more streamlined and easier to follow. Maybe it’s like not really comparable as they’re different thematically and stylistically, but I remember numerous times during HOTD being like “who’s that guy again?” Or “why are they doing this again?”

TLOU is solid storytelling and great acting. Coming into it with no background, my wife and I thoroughly enjoyed ourselves far more."
VeggieTales in the House,It’s a copycat industry so be on the lookout next year for the newest video game adaptation series: Turok Dinosaur Hunter on Showtime
VeggieTales in the House,Praise Druckmann. Well deserved achievement. It goes without saying that TLOU Season 1 has probably surpassed viewership records for Game of Thrones Season 1 when it first aired as well
VeggieTales in the House,"It’s a good show. The ending felt rushed and a bit of a flop for my wife who didn’t play the games. I think they could have done better with Joel thinking about everything, slap in a ton of flash backs and actually show the action more. 10 more minutes would have been great."
VeggieTales in the House,This is the way.
VeggieTales in the House,It’s because House of the Dragon didn’t cast Pedro Pascal
VeggieTales in the House,So for the fifth straight year some very vocal people who told me a show or a movie was going to bomb for being too woke were wrong? Say it ain't so....
VeggieTales in the House,"They really have to stretch. HOTD still had more peak viewers, but to make TLOU look better they have to go to ""full season viewers"".

Isn't it enough that TLOU did good? HOTD had almost 2 million more viewers on air date."
VeggieTales in the House,"I must applaud the show's comittement to the source material, but the execution left me wanting. I didn't enjoy it nearly as much as HotD.

Ellie not being able to swin paid off with her nearly drowning while trying to reach the hospital near the end of the game, but that was cut from the story. Instead we got a flashback, which explains why Ellie is immune, which undermines why it has to be Ellie that needs to die in order to produce a cure. 

Action setpiece, tense sequences where you sneak past Clickers, or move through spore-filled underground tunnels (which wouldn't work anyway, given how they changed the cordiceps), the show could have used more of those."
VeggieTales in the House,House of the Dragon season 2 and Last of Us season 2 are going to pull huge numbers is what you're telling me. HBO wins on both counts.
VeggieTales in the House,"While the show has been strong I feel like they’re making changes to make part 2 make more sense. So much deconstructing of Joel as a strong survivalist. Too much Ellie making jabs at Joel and not enough of Ellie and Joel bonding. It took 6+ episodes before we got any survival bonding. This show feels rushed and it feels like Druckman is changing so much just to make part 1 make part 2 make sense. Part 2 made so little sense vs part 1. 

I haven’t hated this but as I went through this show it got worse and worse imo. I am not looking forward to the less well received part of the Last of Us getting more love. This first season has felt rushed in ways."
VeggieTales in the House,"Great HBO, now do oryx and crake!"
VeggieTales in the House,HoTD > TLoU
VeggieTales in the House,"Don’t care, HOT D still better 👍

TLOU was pretty good but it didn’t really blow me away. A nice 7/10 show, maybe 8. Was never gripped like I was watching my Targ friends weekly"
VeggieTales in the House,"Kid asked me why did Marlene task a single man to deliver Ellie across the country when she managed to teleport there before them with a big armed crew?

I didn't know what to say"
VeggieTales in the House,"Man, I really hope HBO picks up a good Sci Fi IP. That would be the ultimate trio.

Bring back FIREFLY please"
VeggieTales in the House,"Its almost like HOTD becoming popular brought in more viewers for this show to do even better  🤔

This is why making well written content matters."
VeggieTales in the House,Bring back WestWorld!
VeggieTales in the House,"I never played the game or seen anyone do it.
So i didnt know what to expect when i started watching this series.
After the 2 first episodes i pre-ordered the PC release for the las of us, after 5 episodes i jumped on youtube and watched jacksepticeyes playtrough of the last of us 2.

I don't know why i never bothered earlier, but goddamn this is some good shit."
VeggieTales in the House,God I Hope so
VeggieTales in the House,Well deserved. The Last of Us is the better show with better source material and audiences clearly agree with that sentiment
VeggieTales in the House,How the hell?
VeggieTales in the House,"Unpopular opinion but to me this show was way overrated. Boring, characters making dumb decisions, like walking around unattentive. I enjoyed Raised by Wolves and From much more."
VeggieTales in the House,"As an experiment in turning a video game into a show, I thought The last of us was really great sometimes. The last episode however, did not work for me at all."
VeggieTales in the House,Pascal Power.
VeggieTales in the House,Now get the rights to Red Dead Redemption. Adapt the 2nd game first and then the 1st.
VeggieTales in the House,"The most overhyped tv show I've ever seen. Just wait, it's not even going to be close to House of the Dragon in terms of award nominations"
VeggieTales in the House,I'm happy these two shows got made but at the same time it makes it hurt even more seeing things like Wheel of Time and The Witcher with c tier writers with no respect for the source material.
VeggieTales in the House,"And people try to say that hbo is the worst streaming platform. HBO is by far the highest standard when it comes to making quality content, it’s not even close."
VeggieTales in the House,Is the season over yet? Can I pay for one month of HBO and watch it all at once?
VeggieTales in the House,if only they did halo correctly.
VeggieTales in the House,"hey, i didn’t have time to follow the show this last month, was it good?  did it feel like a video game movie addaptation?"
VeggieTales in the House,[deleted]
VeggieTales in the House,It was pretty lame compared to HOTD.
VeggieTales in the House,Its a much better show so thats great
VeggieTales in the House,Good
VeggieTales in the House,"Excellent, TLOU was so much better."
VeggieTales in the House,"Why does anyone care about this kind of thing? If it’s good it’s good, do we really need to know who’s watching which more?"
VeggieTales in the House,"It's a bit like comparing the heights of new NBA players to Minut Bol.  They are all frigging giants.

I'm just impressed that HBO has managed to keep its quality > quantity in an era that seems to be all going the latter (at least in terms of it's original scripted content, not so much the streaming service licensed content)."
VeggieTales in the House,The nice part about The Last of Us compared to House of the Dragon is that you can see things on your TV screen when you watch it.
VeggieTales in the House,Good. It was better.
VeggieTales in the House,"Well deserved. 

Craig Mazen does it again"
VeggieTales in the House,"Well deserved. Great casting, even greater writers."
VeggieTales in the House,Deserved. It's a better show.
VeggieTales in the House,"That’s crazy, as HotD was loads better, imo. It even came from the public falling out that was Got season 8."
VeggieTales in the House,"No surprise. HOTD was a pretentious, often boring disappointment. TLOU wasn't perfect but at least met my high expectations."
VeggieTales in the House,I honestly didn’t like house of the dragon but loved TLOU but that’s just my opinion
VeggieTales in the House,Was it really THAT good???
VeggieTales in the House,"Hype is a powerful thing.

I watched it all and thought it was okay. The game is superior."
VeggieTales in the House,"Almost as if respecting the source material has its pay offs. While HOTG’s been doing great job at sticking near the source material, the fuck up that was Game of Thrones season 8, has tarnished the brand’s reputation. IMHO."
VeggieTales in the House,My favorite thing about The Last of Us is that there were no late night misunderstandings that dropped the entire European country into a bloody war and made a family slowly kill each other over the course of decades which resulted in one of their descendants losing it 270 years down the line and burning a city down :)
VeggieTales in the House,"That's because ""The Last of Us"" wasn't a mediocre show trying its damnedest to ride the hype of a show that came out ten years ago."
VeggieTales in the House,Now let's get them to do an Uncharted series on HBO. Can Craig do comedy?
VeggieTales in the House,Good. Screw Game of Thrones and everything that spawned from it in the cinematic spectrum. They did us so freaking dirty with that last season.
VeggieTales in the House,"I couldn't finish HotD, got to episode 5 dragging my feet. I watched TloU every Sunday night, it was a better show for me personally, but I think my opinion is from a biased perspective, I played the game, but never read the story about HotD so felt less invested"
VeggieTales in the House,It's a vastly better show
VeggieTales in the House,Not surprised.  House of the Dragon was awful
VeggieTales in the House,I dropped off hard with House of Dragons. I got to episode 8 and just forgot about it.
VeggieTales in the House,"This season felt so rushed

Episode 3 spent too much time away from Joel and Ellie. That episode being longer than the finale is a shame

The lack of infected is a damn shame

Walking dead season 1 was much better"
VeggieTales in the House,"HoD sucks donkey balls.
That’s why."
VeggieTales in the House,"I didn't care for house of the dragon. Just didn't grab me. I feel like the only one. On the other hand, I loved TLOU."
VeggieTales in the House,Not watching any gOt spin-offs as revenge for season 8
VeggieTales in the House,I couldn’t get into either show. I think I’m over GOT and zombie type shit. I’d like to see more dramas about real life again. Plus that girl in The Last of Us just makes me want to turn of my television.
VeggieTales in the House,It was better.
VeggieTales in the House,It's worth pointing out that HotD went up head to head with NFL football
VeggieTales in the House,"fuck that game of thrones lite boring ass bullshit

this isnt even close"
VeggieTales in the House,HotD is the definition of mid and I'm tired of holding my tongue
VeggieTales in the House,This always ends each episode with a “OH NO!’ It’s always a long week until the next episode!
VeggieTales in the House,"Loved both.  HBO is back, baby."
VeggieTales in the House,"I can't watch shows like these. I have the attention span of a gnat and I get bored, really bored."
VeggieTales in the House,"Yeah, because house of the dragon sucked in comparison"
VeggieTales in the House,"If it keeps sticking close to the games, it’s going to jump from Game of Thrones Season 1 to Season 8, in only two seasons. I am a fan of the games, but The Last of Us Part 2 is a narrative dumpster fire."
VeggieTales in the House,What’s the appeal of the shitty incest show? Are people really that degenerate?
VeggieTales in the House,…. Because it is FUCKING AWESOME
VeggieTales in the House,Can’t wait for season 2
VeggieTales in the House,Fucking Obviously
VeggieTales in the House,"I’m still not really healed from how the last few seasons of GoT went, and House of the Dragon seemed played out by the time it started. I needed more substance than watching a show that uses soft core porn as it’s backbone. The Last of Us was one of the best shows I’ve seen in a while."
VeggieTales in the House,"Of course it did. It's a much better quality show. 

George RR Martin is done. Dont care about that man and his little universe anymore."
VeggieTales in the House,It was better than house of the dragon but doesn’t even compare to the game.
VeggieTales in the House,HOTD was awful. Just a politics show for the casual viewer.
VeggieTales in the House,Not bad for a show that is so boring.
Lilyhammer,"It would have been hilariously embarrassing if they lost their first ""Netflix original."""
Lilyhammer,To think my tiny Norwegian town has an unofficial Sopranos spinoff made by Netflix is so fuckin bonkers lmao.
Lilyhammer,"I'm not a big subtitle guy, but I loved this show. Ended with a lot of open plot lines. Really wish it had got one more season to finish everything up."
Lilyhammer,"Just when i thought i was out, they pull me Back in"
Lilyhammer,You’re only as good as your last envelope.
Lilyhammer,I'd like to lick a lemon lollipop in Lillehammer.
Lilyhammer,We did it! I guess...
Lilyhammer,Is the show any good?
Lilyhammer,"I watched the first season years ago. I liked it but never finished it.

When they said it was going to go away, I went back and binged it.

It's good. Weird, but good. And despite what others have said, there really arent any open plot lines aside from a general ""what do they do next?"" Also, Netflix didn't really cancel it; its production was pretty complicated with multiple, overlapping jurisdictions.

It's no Sopranos, and sometimes the writing is...a little off, but it's a fun show. I think it gets much better season 2, but mostly it's getting used to the language barrier in season 1."
Lilyhammer,Just when I thought I was out...
Lilyhammer,This was actually a really good show. Really hope they decide to bring it back for another season or a special?
Lilyhammer,Tulsa King crossover time
Lilyhammer,Love that show
Lilyhammer,He made him an offer he couldn’t refuse
Lilyhammer,This is a good show.
Lilyhammer,It was Anti-Norwegian Discrimination
Lilyhammer,Gabagool… ova here
Lilyhammer,"Just binged it again as it was gonna be removed. 

Well played Netflix, you bloody got me.

Great show though, shame about the slightly rushed ending."
Lilyhammer,"I have so many weird connections to this show. I live in the same town as SVS in Jersey. I actually dated a girl who lived next door. Also my grandfather is from Norway, and now for some reason, my cousins keep posting now about knowing Little Stephen…

One was in NYC recently and Van Zandt took him to meet the drummer from Sonic Youth. I have no idea on the connection outside the fact my cousin is Norwegian."
Lilyhammer,Brilliant show!
Lilyhammer,I wanted to see more seasons... it was a weird quirky and funny show.  I enjoyed it.
Lilyhammer,Most slept on series. One of my favorites
Lilyhammer,Criminally underrated show.
Lilyhammer,I straight up forgot about this show. Season 1 was great.
Lilyhammer,I rmeber watching this show cuz it was the first original and boy did it suck lol. There was nothing to watch back then.
Lilyhammer,"If you like a series with an ending, don't watch this one. It didn't end, it just went away. I was looking forward to the second season, which never happened. I can't recommend investing your time on this one.

EDIT: oops, three seasons. Still stand by the rest of my comment. It needed an ending."
Lilyhammer,"I had tried to watch years ago but didn't like it. Once I heard it was going away I binged it.  It seemed very homophobic, if it was trying to be tongue in check the lead isn't skilled enough to pull it off. I just kept watching it because some of the actors & actresses are in Norseman which I find very funny.

I wish had been better because the concept is really cool. The best part of that show was the guest stars. Especially his brother in the last episode."
Lilyhammer,"I saw like the first 2 episodes and then never watched it again, is it good?"
Lilyhammer,"Well November 30th, netflix will look like a waste land. Then are losing ALOT of shows and movies."
Lilyhammer,"Damn, I'd just binged the whole series in expectation of it going away.  Oh well, no regrets, still enjoyed it."
Lilyhammer,Oh good I had this on my list.
Lilyhammer,"Just when i thought i was out, they pull me Back in."
Lilyhammer,Very allegorical
Lilyhammer,"Yet, if House of Cards has the same issue no one will care."
Lilyhammer,"also their shitty looking low budget mega sleeper hit. the pilot even had that fuzzy cinematography synonymous with the shittiest budget indie movies.

edit: for people who didnt get what i said, i'm saying the show is good."
Lilyhammer,Fun Fact: lillyhammer is Not available on German Netflix. You can onlx Watch it on Amazon Prime through a channel
Lilyhammer,That’s how the entire state of New Jersey has felt since 1999
Lilyhammer,Its a tiny town that hosted the Olympic Games though
Lilyhammer,I am literally fatigued of having this conversation about Netflix shows on this subreddit. SO MANY are cancelled too soon. Gives me whiplash.
Lilyhammer,You're gonna make that same stupid joke every time that comes up?
Lilyhammer,Looks like someone's a little lost
Lilyhammer,I had been meaning to get to it and finally did when I saw it was being removed.  Binged it all in a week.  Really a lot of fun.  Not a great show.  But a fun one.
Lilyhammer,"If you've watched The Sopranos or like culture-clash stuff, yes. It's hilarious."
Lilyhammer,"First two seasons are great, and wraps up the initial story neatly. The third is a bit more controversial and ends with a lot of loose ends."
Lilyhammer,Yes. Yes it is.
Lilyhammer,It’s a great show and very unexpected and underrated
Lilyhammer,"If you like Sil from Sopranos and want to see him in a fish out of water environment, this is the show for you."
Lilyhammer,Yep
Lilyhammer,It’s great
Lilyhammer,It's okay
Lilyhammer,I like to think of it as a dramedy version. Still wish it had more episodes in it because it easily had 2 more seasons to run
Lilyhammer,It has three seasons.
Lilyhammer,"Gay Elvis? What's next? Straight Liberace?

I love this cheeky show."
Lilyhammer,"Italian American in a foreign country. it's so good. still unique. it's ridiculous, hilarious. and at least to me, I don't think any characters are annoying."
Lilyhammer,Why specifically...? Im out of the loop
Lilyhammer,"Came here for this quote, thanks"
Lilyhammer,The sacred and the propane
Lilyhammer,[The plan: frame Steven Van Zandt for serial sex crimes to justify losing his show.](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E4sb8jIX0AMeHO-?format=jpg&name=small)
Lilyhammer,"It was such a great series for the first 2 or 3 seasons. It helped Netflix rise up. But even before Spacey was removed, the show jumped the shark."
Lilyhammer,[removed]
Lilyhammer,Even weirder when you’re a New Jerseyian with Norwegian roots.
Lilyhammer,"""Really wish it had got one more season to finish everything up.""

That could be their official slogan."
Lilyhammer,"More shows got cancelled on regular networks way before Netflix was even a thing.

People acting like this is a new thing."
Lilyhammer,Glow comes to mind.
Lilyhammer,It's the primary reason I refuse to start any new show on Netflix. Archive 41 (or whatever number) absolutely ruined Netflix for me.
Lilyhammer,[deleted]
Lilyhammer,Mindhunter…. Whateva happened there.
Lilyhammer,Tbh the show would have been better if it had one less season rather than one more. It was all wrapped up quite neatly after the second season.
Lilyhammer,"Dunno why you're being down voted....this is also a Sopranos quote

Frankly I'm depressed and ashamed"
Lilyhammer,"This is the correct answer. It's fun, but it's not especially *good*."
Lilyhammer,"I find Tulsa King, which just started airing on Paramount+, to be very similar to LIlihammer so far.  However, Terrence Winter is the showrunner, so I have high hopes and so far haven't been disappointed.  Only two episodes in though."
Lilyhammer,Do *you* like skateboarding?
Lilyhammer,A show I wish was on Netflix so I didn’t even to stream it illegally in the uk
Lilyhammer,I actually crashed my Scion TC going 100mph
Lilyhammer,"It really escalated too quickly. They had him move from a >!party position in the House!< to >!Vice President!< in one season. And then >!President!< in the next one. The fun was watching him try obtaining power. Nothing really interesting about already being there.

Silicon Valley could go for so long because they would reset to a version of status quo by the end of each season."
Lilyhammer,"That was real? I saw that movie, I thought it was bullshit"
Lilyhammer,>	SOUTH jersey
Lilyhammer,Yeah. It’s basically three chemical plans and a interstate though.
Lilyhammer,"They did, but they left the sets up after the show ended, and now squatters live there and roleplay being New Yorkers."
Lilyhammer,As a huge GLOW fan this hurts so much.
Lilyhammer,"Networks generally handled it better, be fucking real. There are a few exceptions, but the big 3 networks generally handled it far better."
Lilyhammer,Still not over the cancellation of My Name is Earl all these years later
Lilyhammer,"> i read once it's cheaper for netflix to produce the first season of a new show than multiple seasons of a current show. 

It's cheaper and also generally has more of an impact in terms of subscribers.

Apple announces something like Severance and a lot of people are now paying attention to the platform and will potentially subscribe to check it out. Apple announces the second season of Severance and now only the people who liked the first season care, with that number typically decreasing year-over-year. 

For many this is not actually the problem, it's shows having narratives that extend beyond what what Netflix typically does. This is why I have no faith in the One Piece adaptation. Unless the goal is to do the first saga, there are still nine more sagas to catch up to current and there is no chance the series lasts that long. A lot of other series shoot for five or six seasons, despite only five series last that long and those five include The Crown, Stranger Things, Orange is the New Black and House of Cards. People would be a lot more receptive if shows went for two or three season stories over what we saw with The OA where a lot is teased, but nothing explored."
Lilyhammer,"And still it was Fincher's decision to stop making Manhunter, not Netflix."
Lilyhammer,Can you imagine that? A television subreddit not knowing Sopranos quotes?
Lilyhammer,"It's more a The Godfather quote.

That was the whole point of the scene, to make a reference to the Godfather."
Lilyhammer,"I dunno, I thought it was good. Wouldn't exactly call it great but I really enjoyed it."
Lilyhammer,Watched the second half of the latest episode last night.  Seemed like it could be fun. Hoping my YTTV records a replay of the first and second episodes soon.
Lilyhammer,What that means?
Lilyhammer,[deleted]
Lilyhammer,"They were trying to map it to the original series:

- >!In the first series of both, Frank is the Whip!<
- >!In the second series of both, Frank rises to the position of chief executive!<
- >!In the third series of the UK series, Frank spars with the King and is ultimately assassinated; the US series keeps the assassination _attempt_, but that's kinda it!<"
Lilyhammer,"I think the pacing was fine with him moving up the ladder, they just didn't have enough of a story to make it worth 6 seasons, they should've just had it wrap with three or four with him ultimately failing to keep power. All the stuff with using martial law to rig elections was just silly."
Lilyhammer,I think that it should have ended with >!him getting what he wanted. Leave it on a high note.!<
Lilyhammer,My favorite line in the series.
Lilyhammer,He killed eighteen Czechoslovakians. The guy’s an interior decorator!
Lilyhammer,"No,

They really didn't.  You'd get a cancellation in the middle of your run, or they'd cut your production numbers back from 22 to 18, or 16, while you were already in production making wrap ups impossible.  Or they'd cancel you after the last episode was shot allowing for no actual finale, or they'd cancel you during the summer after a cliff-hanger, or they'd cancel it 8 episodes in without even completing a season so you get no wrap up at all.  Shows are now purchased a season at a time.  You have a beginning middle, and end, and if you're doing a cliffhanger, it's because you know you're coming back.  Otherwise they just wrap it up."
Lilyhammer,"Yeah I feel bad for the show creators. Netflix probably promises them a bigger budget than the other services but then pulls the plug on nearly all of them unless it's The Crown or Stranger Things.

I wonder if there will be a point where people who land their deals with them will re-write their opuses to be 2 seasons max"
Lilyhammer,Fuckin parakeet
Lilyhammer,You must’ve been the top of your fuckin’ class

Secret Garden,"Elia Kazan makes me feel like naming names.

Secret Garden,"Just like the actual show, I didn't make it too far into your review. But you did give me an unintentional snort-laugh.

> In fact, he is a genuine wine somalian.

David Schwimmer wouldn't be able to play a convincing Somalian. He might, however, be a passable sommelier."
Secret Garden,"I don't know if you wrote about this because that's too much reading for me right now, but do you remember that flashback scene of Schwimmer's wife being hit by the car? I have no fucking idea what was going through their head when they did that scene because its supposed to be sad, but it was just flat out hilarious.

There was also another scene where the Schwimmer's son almost gets hit by a car and he literally just sits down right in the same spot and starts drawing his dead mom. 

This show was fucking stupid."
Secret Garden,I appreciate your review in lieu of viewing a show that I was passively curious about. Funny and fairly succinct.
Secret Garden,">Dion is also in good with his public defender, Marissa **(played by E.E. Cummings)**. You can tell by the way he's fucking her on a table two minutes into the Pilot episode.

To be fair, E.E. Cummings is [pretty dreamy.](http://www.litkicks.com/sites/default/files/eecummings.jpg)"
Secret Garden,It wasn't bad it just tried to do too much.  Every character had some sort of lie they were telling someone else.  Half the characters were doing illegal shit. Its like people don't understand that Breaking Bad didn't start at the fifth season.  You have to build up to that shit.  I honestly have the same issue with Ozark. 
Secret Garden,Has no one else noticed this was written by Vargas?
Secret Garden,"I remember when this was announced I was pretty hyped. I had hope for this being AMC's next great TV show. Then the premiere happened, with the 40 something metascore and the barrage of bad reviews from both critics and viewers and I never bothered checking it. "
Secret Garden,[removed]
Secret Garden,"Worst Show I ever watched to Completion: WEEDS. I watched all 6 or 8 seasons and i started hating it after season 1. I mean i didn't love season 1 but the hate was real after Season 1 and every twist and turn just made me angrier. It's one of the worst shows I've ever watched much less to completion.

I think the only reason I watched it was an NPR Fresh Air interview about the Banana thing it sounded interesting and it kinda was but           it hoenstly wasn't worth season after season of DerpFace McGee. It made me hate R.E.D. 2 Because i couldn't see the female lead as anything other than nancy botwin."
Secret Garden,The somalian thing in this review is more entertaining than the actual TV show...
Secret Garden,"From now on, I'm referring to all sommoliers as ""wine Somalians""."
Secret Garden,"Because I don't know anything about wine, I figured that's what they were called. :("
Secret Garden,"""I'm the the maitre d' now."""
Secret Garden,this is random af but did you all know there are water sommelier's? 
Secret Garden,"Hello, I am a genuine wine somalian."
Secret Garden,"Oh man, do you have a link to the scene with his wife?"
Secret Garden,Ozark is my favorite show of the year next to Dark. I loved it...
Secret Garden,"> A “somalian” has dengue fever and makes his living in small inflatable boat.

you know Somalians are people right? like they exist beyond the realm of TV news footage. Like 1/3 of my sister's friends are Somalian not cool dude."
Secret Garden,Wine pirates.
Secret Garden,"Don't be sad about not knowing about wine.  Nobody knows everything.  You don't need to be a douche to enjoy wine (yes, statistics seem to disprove this theory though!) but for a bit of a look at how complicated wine can be but in a really entertaining way check out Somm on Netflix.  About four people trying to achieve Grand Sommelier status.  I enjoy wine, know what I enjoy, try to keep the douchiness to a minimum, don't do tastings, etc. and found this doco fascinating.  The knowledge these guys needed was phenomenal, but they are the Michael Jordans of wine."

Secret Garden,"Sorry, that was the only one I found. Honestly, it wasn't as funny as expected, just bad.

The episode is on Hulu if you have it, though I don't know what you would start."

Secret Garden,"Hey, no need to apologize man. Thanks for finding the scene."
Secret Garden,"A year after we were first married,  My wife and I lied our faces off to get on our favourite tv show called ""Newlywed Nearly Dead"". It was a show filmed in and around Ontario Canada,about newlyweds who were having a rough go in their first year. Some relationship expert comes in, gives you each little task to fix your marriage.
   We just made up a bunch of stuff about each other to get on the show, had lots of fun filming for 4 weeks, and then they payed us 1000$.  

 I think our episode is hilarious.

Secret Garden,"Working on TV right now, Jason Bateman show..just wrapped an all nighter"
Secret Garden,"Me, three times. Once in the crowd at a sports event and twice in the local news because I happened to be walking by and ended up being interviewed (by the same guy both times)."
Secret Garden,"Been on MTV (interviewed on the street in NYC, said something funny they used and long lost friend got in touch). Same thing happened with local (L.A.) news at a restaurant opening. Both times, for months later I had people mention it. 

For awhile a lifetime ago, I did extra work and was on a couple dozen TV shows and a few movies (***Last Action Hero, In The Line of Fire***).

A rather bizarre/macabre story is from the week long night shoot on ***Last Action Hero*** in Culver City at the ""Munchkin Hotel"" where the opening scene of the film within a film was shot. They had all these fake police cars in the street with their emergency lights going. 

Suddenly there was this commotion when a car arrived and soon *actual* police & an ambulance arrived. Later that night the sad story trickled down to us: three guys had gone to do a drug deal, it went bad and one got shot in the stomach. His buddies were trying to find an ER to take him to, saw all the police emergency lights and hoped the ""police"" could save their friend. He died and there was an ER close by they might have gotten him to in time had they not stopped at the set. 

Incidentally, this was one of two times I was near the aftermath of a bad drug deal. Another time on a nearby freeway I saw two guys jump out of car on an on ramp and run away. I circled back to find another would be Samaritan and a CHP officer. Seems the guy in the back seat shot the driver and then he & the passenger ran off. Cop seemed to think the driver would live. "
Secret Garden,"Once I was just like, delivering adult balloons and non alcoholic cider and this strange guy named Chris asked me to take a seat, over there. "
Secret Garden,I got slimed on Nickelodeon
Secret Garden,Was on the news when I was about 13-15 somewhere around that age I'm 25 now. Was attending a protest in Orlando some years back it was against scientology and there bogus ways. Happened in May was pretty cool seeing myself on the news later that night.
Secret Garden,"Hello fellow Aussie. 

Was on a random episode of 'The Book Place', back in the early 90's. 

They had me jumping around trying to pop balloons. "
Secret Garden,"I'm an actor. I've been in a ton of those crime re-enactment shows for ID Network. While it's national TV, it's probably the lowest paying gig in town. I make a lot more money doing local commercials and industrials. Still, it's nice to have something for my out of town friends and family to see, even if it's sometimes pretty cheesy. "
Secret Garden,"I was on question time (uk politics show). I asked a couple of questions and had the politicians answering me directly. 

Good times. "
Secret Garden,"I got interviewed on the street for the news after the Red Sox GM got fired last year and they used a clip in the show. Then, there was another time when I went to a Red Sox game last year in Toronto. The people next to me were wearing Blue Jays hats and Bruins shirts (for whatever reason) so NESN showed them up close. I only found out because my friend saw people talking about those guys on Twitter and you could see me in the background of the screenshot.

Secret Garden,"When my mom was on Jeopardy back in the 90s, the local news station came by our house to interview us. We have it on tape somewhere but my mom isn't a big fan of rewatching it (she got second, still won a trip to Mexico). She had been selected in the same test rounds as the news station's anchor who was on the next night of Jeopardy so they interviewed us too. My big takeaway from her experience was that Alex Trebek is an asshole."
Secret Garden,I've been on and lost who wants to be a millionaire (while Cedric was the host)
Secret Garden,"Fellow Aussie as well.  When Fast Forward did a few episodes from Hamilton Island I got to drive the actors around for the week and ended up being an extra for a few skits.  This was when Peter Moon, Magda, Marg Downey, Jane Turner, Glen Robbins, Gina Riley etc were the cast.

Every last one of them were extremely friendly and professional.  Once the realised I did night audit and then drove them around all day they loaded me up with swag. Very tired but fantastic week.  Best part was actually chatting to one of the producers and discussing why FF was better than Comedy Company.  Some very good reasons I thought.

I got to be a step for Marg Downey to walk up onto a yacht.  Method'd the shit outta that scene."
Secret Garden,I gave a dollar to the Jerry Lewis telethon at my local mall. You got to walk by on live t.v. and drop your donation in a large glass tank. I loved the thought of being on live tv so much that my mom gave me an extra dollar to walk through and do it again...nailed it! Oh...a dollar was a big deal then...we probably spent our food money.

"
Secret Garden,"a little less than ten years ago, i was a PA on a show called ""clean house"" i think it was on the style network.  my cousin was a producer and she managed to get me the job.  it was kind of a home remodeling show, where they visit someone's incredibly messy house and basically clean it out and remodel at least one room.  but i worked on the special 2hr episode where they cleaned out and rennovated an entire house.  a house that had one their contest of ""messiest house in america"". the house was fucking awful and as a PA, they gave us all this shittiest jobs.  

anyway, one day a grip and one of the camera guys were just fucking around with the camera with behind the scenes stuff.  they did interviews of all the PA's when we were all on break just sitting around.  i managed to say something funny, something about how if you get lost in this town, you can always follow the smell back to the house.  the scene ended up on some compilation episode, like a special ""behind the scenes"" episode or something.  my cousin told me when it aired and i watched my big 5 second on-screen debut with a few friends when we were hanging out that night.  "
Secret Garden,"My fiance and her sister were on that Sharon talk show years ago to talk about Wilsons Disease, which both of them have. I almost didn't believe her at first until she showed me the old VHS her parents made when it aired. Make-a-wish got them on there and also took them on a tour of the studio that most normal people don't get to go. She talked with one of the producers for ER at the time, whom later worked on House and had an episode made about Wilsons that was eerily close to her life. I can't remember the name or season of the episode off hand."
Secret Garden,"Was on two game shows. Back around 1990, Donald Trump had a game show called Trump Card. Came in 2nd, got comped for an overnight stay at a Trump hotel and won $750.  Trump wasn't there.

Also on a game show called ""Inspiration, Please!"" In around 1999 on the Faith & Values Network. Came in 2nd again but protested the ""winning"" answer and won some money to let it go"
Secret Garden,"15 seconds of fame here. ""Diff'rent Strokes."" The show needed a bunch of kids for an episode with Boy Scouts. Guess they thought it was easier to hire real Boy Scouts, complete with uniforms. They took our badges/patches off and sewed on new ones for troops around NYC. I know I got paid, but I only got a few GI Joes out of it. Coincidentally, my family went on our first international vacation that year. Hmm..."
Secret Garden,"Jose Luis Sin Censura, a local show here in L.A. that was a Jerry Springer in Spanish. I was one of the people in the crowd selected to fight. The whole show, as you might imagine, is staged. All the guests of the show, for the most part, do not know each other. And the people in the crowd that ask questions and fight, are pre-selected before the show. 

MTV's Burned. It was only on for a summer. Premise of the show was to expose fake players or wannabe ladies men. We had an acquaintance that was perfect for the show. The casting company felt the same way and booked us for the show. He had no clue what was happening. He was just told by my brother that they were going to a party in Hollywood. My buddies and I drove to the offices of the production company and they drove us to the house where the party was to avoid him noticing our car.

The party is packed and the ratio is like 90/10 in favor of the women. Anyone in their right mind would've assumed it was a set up. They sit us in a bed room, give us headphones and we all watch and listen on the little monitors. He shows up with my brother and our job was to point out all his lies. The producer told me that after 15 minutes they had enough material to make multiple shows and could stop filming. He laughed because he said he's never seen someone lie that much. They film for about another 20 minutes. One of the girls he was talking to takes him inside the house and stands in front of the TV. The video they just recorded starts playing of all his lies. She confronts him about lies and whether he'll change. He's in-different. We come out and have a big laugh (though he wasn't happy at all). They have all of us do those interview confessional deals you see on reality shows. They make you do multiple takes until you show the emotions they want. Show aired a few months later. We no longer talk to him."
Secret Garden,"oddly enough I was on Dr harry back in the day, and he too crushed my dreams, by telling me my cat was pregnant, then telling me off camera to have it desexed and basically kitty abortion, when all was said and done cat wasn't even pregnant. "
Secret Garden,"Was walking along campus when I was asked to do an interview about my experience with AIDS education for the local news. It was only a small thing for a small city, but they used my overall opinion as the voice over for the wrap up at the end of the segment, which was cool. I was worried I'd look / sound bad on TV, but I did great! "
Secret Garden,I've been on 9 News Perth a couple of times

Secret Garden,"I used to work at a PBS station that did a yearly televised auction to supplement it's operating budget.  My boss told me that he needed a model for the green and pink wedding dress that had been donated from a designer store.  The main material of the dress was that sort of duo tone stuff this is white from one angle, but pink from another or when light hits it strongly.  The lace was light green.  So was the detailing that was all over it ... I don't know what it's called but imagine light green silly string in looping patterns.  I was then told that I would be fired unless I wore it.  The dress was too small for me by a good bit and I was sort of strapped into it.  Whoever bought it was likely got a bit of a shock when they picked it up and saw how tiny it was.  



I left that job not long after.  "
Secret Garden,"Was interviewed by a national tv station as part of their program which focused on schools because a friend and I had won the regional leg of a national quiz competition. Was 16 at the time, 26 now. "
Secret Garden,"I was on s2e1 of the listener. There is a chess scene at the start of the ep. In the scene you will see a guy taking bets and my line was ""I'll take that bet"" then I was to hand the cash over to the bookie. Problem was they had to do like 5 takes and i could only stay for 2 of them so i ended up getting replaced but after ""the listener"" wins all the chess games you can see me right in the front of the background.

Secret Garden,I volunteer for golf competitions and they were passing one in the golf channel and they followed one of the players I was with. I look bored as hell when they are playing.
Secret Garden,Does the background of the Today Show count?
Secret Garden,"I was interviewed about Brexit for a Japanese tv station, which was kinda cool (in English, just to clarify)."
Secret Garden,"I was on an episode of Cops. In the background at a protest March, did not get arrested.

Even better was getting my letter on Late Night With David Letterman's viewer mail in 1991. So I wasn't on TV but my handwriting and name were."
Secret Garden,"Everybody's been on the news at least once. I live in Baton Rouge and stuck my head out the window while driving past the news camera in front of the church where the police officers funeral was. But I've been on that news channel three times before. I was at a baseball game another time and because I was 10 and cute, the cameraman filmed me the whole time. You may not be an actor, but there's a chance that you were on tv somehow"
Secret Garden,"Can't say I've been on a regular program, but back when I was still in choir as a teen, we were a part of an event commemorating the 50th anniversary of the bombing of Hiroshima, which was broadcast live via NHK.  That same summer, a couple of us were also chosen to join an international youth ensemble that performed during a special church service in San Francisco.  The service was part of the UN's 50th Anniversary, and I believe was aired on C-SPAN, along with snippets on the various news shows (and holy crap were there ever a ton of newsies around the cathedral that morning, lol)."
Secret Garden,Also another Australian i used to work at channel nine in their news department so i was on of those people you see sitting behind the news reader. I worked there for about 3 months so i was technically on tv a bit.
Secret Garden,"Twice times I believe, once just was shown on TV at a football game as I was seated a little above the tunnel and was seen as the players came out pretty clearly. Then I can be seen in a interview for Carlton News many years ago as my parents are interviewed about the escalators on the tube stations were broken. I can be seen jumping up and down to get into shot during the interview. I'm essentially a TV star. "
Secret Garden,"I did a voice for Comedy Central's animated sketch show TripTank.








A few weeks before it aired, I was watching South Park, and it went to commercial, so I looked down at my tablet and wasn't paying attention. Suddenly I hear a familiar voice... and I realized that it was my voice in a promo for TripTank. That was an incredible moment for me."
Secret Garden,I threw a rock at Donald Trump's car. Turns out it was being filmed at the time.
Secret Garden,"I have been in the audience (with a speaking role in an episode I can't seem to find at the moment!)  for a CBC talk show that I had spent a couple of years interning for. Attendance was slightly lower during one day of filming, so I was offered to fill in as it's definitely a bit of a neat opportunity! 

[Here's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Y_CApNIzEs&feature=youtu.be&list=PL9DLSKu7q0q8RqBaBOC4_zi33UIBOzj4y&t=455) a clip from one episode and a [screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/r2xQz2c.png) from another - don't recall which episode the latter was part of. (I was the one in the dark grey longsleeve)

Thoroughly enjoyed the internship all the way through - learned a lot from everyone there. 
"
Secret Garden,I got on the local news for two seconds when I walked passed a firetruck on career day in elementary school when they were filming.
Secret Garden,I was on an episode of Cops once 
Secret Garden,"I was interviewed by local news once after winning a provincial speedskating meet, but that's it. My sister was an extra on the short lived Falcon Beach, though (if anyone remembers that bit of terribleness in the mid 00's)."
Secret Garden,Twice. Once at a student protest of a teacher being transferred during high school and again after my neighbor had a house fire.
Secret Garden,That was hilarious. How old is this?
Secret Garden,"I love how the ""expert"" totally fell for it."
Secret Garden,"That was really fun. Was everything made up? Even the chewing with her mouth open? Cause that really would drive me crazy. Either way, you guys seem like an amazing couple."
Secret Garden,How did your family and friends take it? 
Secret Garden,"This the prototypical reddit sentence: ""...payed us 1000$"""
Secret Garden,"More info please. I love Jason Bateman, what is this show?"
Secret Garden,Arrested Development?
Secret Garden,Can I have your autograph? 
Secret Garden,"One time a news crew had set up inside a small bookshop when Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows had just come out. I must have been the first person to enter after they had gotten there, because as I was paying they hurriedly started shooting, but I didn't think I'd be able to speak on camera so before they got to ask me anything I started slowly walking away from them raising my eyebrow sternly for whatever reason, perhaps thinking it would dissuade them from wanting to talk to me. The news broadcast still aired me walking away, but thankfully without the weird facial expression."
Secret Garden,what the fuck
Secret Garden,Were the drug deals associated with the increased presence of Hollywood types in the area? Heheh.
Gurren Lagann,"For whatever reason I went from Gurren Lagan to Kill La Kill thinking they were the same studio, but they aren’t, are they. 

I still feel like there’s a consistent vibe running through FLCL->Gurren Lagan->Kill La Kill->Cyberpunk: Edgerunners (and I’m sure I’m missing some stuff by virtue of not watching anime in 10 years.)"
Gurren Lagann,Watch Macross Plus
Gurren Lagann,One of my favorites.
Gurren Lagann,Space Dandy is great I remember it filled the Green Lagen hole back when it came out
Gurren Lagann,"I LOVED Gurren Lagann. If you want more epic mech anime, I recommend [Heroic Age](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heroic_Age_(TV_series)). It’s not as good as GL, but I liked it."
Gurren Lagann,Hiroyuki Imaishi who directed Gurren Lagan left Gainax and founded Studio Trigger and then directed Kill La Kill while Kazuki Nakashima wrote both shows.
Gurren Lagann,So Shikabane Hime(Corpse Princess) contains the mid point between Gurren Lagan and KLK. I would also Psycho-Pass is a step towards Edgerunners.
Gurren Lagann,Trigger’s had trouble living up to Gurren Lagan and FLCL but cyberpunk was great. Also add Inferno Cop to the list haha
Gurren Lagann,Most of mine stopped airing when I was under 10
Gurren Lagann,"It's actually a blessing.  You get to binge-watch an entire season in a few days while fans had to wait a week for the next episode.  Since you didn't pay attention during its run, you don't have to worry about people dropping spoilers each week between episodes.  Unless you watch or follow shows to be part of something trendy (e.g., Wandavision), you should consider yourself very fortunate to stumble on an old show that you enjoy."
Gurren Lagann,"Yeah, there’s a lot of great shows and movies that I catch up with many years later. It means I miss out on the conversation around them that happens when they are released. But there is just so much coming out all the time. Even 20 years ago it was more than I could keep up with. So, I don’t let it bother me."
Gurren Lagann,"I'm the same age as you and feel the same. I feel like the main reason would be we were too young when the golden age of TV was going on.

And right now there aren't many beat of all time shows on air.  There are a few amazing ones but they are just starting out, like succession, Ozark. Also BCS is pretty underrated, and it is for sure gonna be a classic like Sopranos in the near future."
Gurren Lagann,I bet you haven't watched Schitt's Creek yet. That should be next on your list.
Gurren Lagann,Thank goodness I found a post to relate to even though it is a bit old. I am really thinking about this when it comes to Pokémon because the final episode to have Ash and Pikachu as the protagonists will be airing next week as of the writing of this post. I honestly can't help but envy the people who kept up with the show since the beginning in 1997 or are up to date through means such as binge-watching.
Gurren Lagann,"Exactly. It almost feels more personal as an experience, like it's your secret little world away from reality. Or a secret time machine to the past."
Gurren Lagann,"I think the last season of Better Call Saul was actually really good, even if it borrowed a bit too much from Ozymandius. As someone who couldn't get into it for the first four seasons, I thought Season 5 was a step in the right direction, and I can see them planting the seeds for something remarkable in the final season. I have a feeling it's gonna be amazing.

Haven't seen Succession or Ozark but I'm looking forward to watching them soon and I'll let you know what I think."
Gurren Lagann,I'll check it out soon!
Gurren Lagann,Definitely looking forward to hearing your opinion when you do

Gurren Lagann,"Parks and Rec IMO has become the best sitcom since Arrested Development. Only thing is it starts off kind of slow, the first season in particular is a blatant rip off of the office. By the third season nearly every episode is wonderful, the cast may be the strongest currently of any show, and a mediocre episode is better than most everything else on. 

Party Down is also great, and it actually starts off perfectly and is a great show for nearly it's entire run. 

The Office U.K is a masterpiece, and should be watched by anyone even if you don't care for British comedy or Ricky Gervias. 

The Simpsons (1-9) is one of the greatest shows ever made. 

Mr. Show with Bob and David-greatest sketch comedy ever made.

Deadwood has the best dialogue of any show ever. It makes poetry out of profanity, cocksucker. 

Justified-probably the best mix of serialized drama and over-arcing story currently going on, with a great cast and is just a really fun show.

Gurren Lagann,Great picks Alan!
Gurren Lagann,Just finished watching the on Netflix Instant. Definitely was wishing there were more seasons. 
Gurren Lagann,Are we having fun yet?
Gurren Lagann,I CANNOT stress Fringe enough. It's one of my favorite shows on television.
Gurren Lagann,"Protip: start with the mini-series. Otherwise you'll begin 1x01 and then a ""previously on"" segment comes up and you'll be all like whaaat?"
Gurren Lagann,"I 2nd, 3rd, and 4th this.  You need to get Battlestar Galactica (the new one, not the one from the late 70's/early 80's) right this instant.  I hope you don't plan on having a life for the next few weeks.  It's going to own you."
Gurren Lagann,"I didn't watch this show for the longest time because, [](/s ""although I won't be the first to complain about being jilted by the end of Lost, the general consensus was negative about the end of BSG."")

Then the show ""Portlandia"" made a joke about how addictive BSG was. One miniseries episode later on Netflix and I think the only time I wasn't watching the show was when I was sleeping. For the next week straight, any free moment I got I was watching BSG--on my phone, at home, even at work. So yes, I think this show definitely needs to be recommended. [](/s ""Besides, I enjoyed the end!"")"

That's exciting, I had no idea."

Gurren Lagann,ha that's mental
Gurren Lagann,Deadwood should be on the top of your list
Hemlock Grove,"I only enjoyed the first season, but I may be an outlier."
Hemlock Grove,FilmRise has to have one the of the worst apps I have ever used
Hemlock Grove,I wanted to like this show so badly. It definitely had the best werewolf transition I've ever seen. And the worst British accent I've ever heard.
Hemlock Grove,"Hemlock Grove is a lot of fun, and still my favorite “Netflix original.” It deserves to live on Shudder."
Hemlock Grove,oh i can't wait to not finish watching that trash fire again
Hemlock Grove,"It was cancelled for a reason…

I watched it because it was one of the early Netflix originals and there weren’t many other streaming platforms around yet.

Season 2 was weird and bad"
Hemlock Grove,It is SO bad
Hemlock Grove,I didn’t know Eli Roth was involved in this series but maybe that helps to explain why it sucked so much
Hemlock Grove,"This show really went off the rails. Solid first season or so, and then it literally devolved into something put together on a dare, or else by someone who had to write, direct, and edit the whole thing by themselves while still being the manager of a busy highway Wendy's. After the vampire mom got a tongue transplant which for some reason caused her to speak with an American accent from then on even though it was in no way relevant to the plot, I completely checked out. Still, it was my initial exposure to Bill Skarsgard and for that I'm grateful."
Hemlock Grove,"I wish articles like this wouldn't refer to it as Netflix ""removing"". It makes it sound like they choose to get rid of it like WB"
Hemlock Grove,I love Famke Jansen but this show was total garbage. I quit it in Season 3 without finishing and I've never wanted to go back.
Hemlock Grove,"Why is is called FilmRise? It really makes no sense. Many of these streaming apps sound like 10 year old kids came up with the names for them....like Hulu, tubi, fubo, to name a few. Perhaps if they had more serious names like HBOMax, Disney+ and Netflix they would be taken more serious."
Hemlock Grove,"Bill Skarsgard as weirdo James Dean was fun in S1


The “Munch’s scream” special effect in S2 was so One Piece"
Hemlock Grove,Awful
Hemlock Grove,WHAT?!
Hemlock Grove,I feel like im the only person who like this show.
Hemlock Grove,"Bad story, terrible acting from literary every actor"
Hemlock Grove,"This was one of the first Netflix shows I started watching, still haven't finished it."
Hemlock Grove,"Same, thought it was an alright bit of schlock since I already like the genre but couldn't get into season 2."
Hemlock Grove,Loved the first season and the chemistry between the two leads then after that the show went completely off the rails
Hemlock Grove,"I liked the first and a little bit under half of the second season. Once the blood machine appeared, I was out. At least in my head. I sat through the rest of it just to see what happened. But it went from, ""Oh, this is a cool take on the myths,"" to, ""Did they mainline True Blood and Twilight? What the everliving sam hill?!"""
Hemlock Grove,"I've watched the first season twice.  I've tried watching the second season twice, and get bored with it about 2-3 episodes in."
Hemlock Grove,The first season is the only season that you need to watch. It’s predictable as shit but at least I felt that there was a story The last two seasons made me so incredibly angry that I wanted to chuck my phone across the room. So much wasted potential for that show. If you ever wanted a show that wastes great performances and so many loose ends watch this show
Hemlock Grove,Does season one feel self contained
Hemlock Grove,You are because every episode was equally terrible.
Hemlock Grove,The worst part is they have like **TEN** different apps.
Hemlock Grove,I also liked it. All these people saying how horrible it was don’t understand people have their own opinions. We like what we like. I wish it had just one more season to wrap everything up. Really wanted to see how the baby grew. *cough*
Hemlock Grove,"Seriously? This show was *horrible*! It’s just absolute trash. The only reason it’s even a mild curiosity is because of an early appearance by Bill Skarsgard which, I suppose, for a certain kind of audience is more than enough.

26% on Rotten Tomatoes, by the way.

There are a lot of good TV shows out  right now that can make you feel a little happier, smarter, sexier, funnier, more excited — or more scared, if that’s what you want. This is not one of them. Don’t let it kill 30 hours of your life."
Hemlock Grove,"Yeah this came out back when watching every Netflix original was a plausible thing to do, and it was the first indication that not every Netflix original was going to be worth watching."
Hemlock Grove,"Season 2 was fun for all the wrong reasons, Season 3 was straight garbage."
Hemlock Grove,Maintaining the illusion that Netflix actually owns anything.
Hemlock Grove,"Just out of curiosity, what phrasing would you prefer they *do* use, then?"
Hemlock Grove,IT MADE IT TO SEASON 3?!
Hemlock Grove,Nothing beats the UK TV channel named 'Dave'
Hemlock Grove,"I wouldn’t call it self-contained - A lot of plots are resolved, but they definitely are setting up season 2. 

That being said, I would have probably been happier stopping at season 1."
Hemlock Grove,"I wouldn't be surprised if there's more.  I haven't used it yet, but I've got the one for British TV shows installed."
Hemlock Grove,The soundtrack was awesome too.
Hemlock Grove,Sometimes watching bad shows and movies can be fun.  Something being bad can be the entertainment value.
Hemlock Grove,After the show left or basically any phrasing that doesn't seem to imply that it was a choice by Netflix to remove it when in reality it was a decision to not pay to have it stay
Hemlock Grove,"Australian streaming service ""Stan"" tho."
Hemlock Grove,Exactly. The show was terrible but I had fun watching it.
Hemlock Grove,Not paying to keep it is effectively Netflix removing it though.
Hemlock Grove,Not at all.
Hemlock Grove,"*For now, no official statement has been given as to a reason for the show’s removal.*

The licence has run out. That is the reason! Looks like the rights will revert back to Gaumont International Television who will likely put the series on the market. It will probably show up on Pluto or Tubi at some point or on cable channels."
Hemlock Grove,"This article connects it to HBO Max’s removal of content, but Netflix doesn’t technically own a lot of its originals. It’s why Daredevil is on Disney+ and Bojack was syndicated on Comedy Central for like a month, plus Narcos being on Tubi. This is probably different than removing content they own to save residual money. 

Still sucks, but… it’ll find its way somewhere I’d imagine."
Hemlock Grove,"It's an odd, discomfiting show, that's for sure, coming from a time when Netflix was figuring itself out with attempts at original programming. I recall being stunned it got a season 3. It was pretty no holds barred, where innocents were as relentlessly punished as much as the guilty, and it threw in mad scientists and Romani curses and vampires and murder and torture with equal abandon. I think I can say it was the weirdest Netflix show ever, but that's not meant as a compliment or a criticism."
Hemlock Grove,oh no i never finished that awful show.
Hemlock Grove,"> Netflix has quietly announced that is removing one of its first original series, the three season-long horror-fantasy “Hemlock Grove,” from its platform on **October 22nd** 


Guess that I've a month to finish the series."
Hemlock Grove,"This show had some incredible funny/bad dialogue

Someone calls a psychologist *Hannibal Lector for animals*"
Hemlock Grove,Pirating is archiving folks
Hemlock Grove,"Honestly this was one of the first Netflix originals I can remember watching, it wasn’t very good but me and my buddies had a fun time watching the first season so I’ll always have fond memories of this show."
Hemlock Grove,"Netflix probably doesn't own the show, it's the same reason the Marvel shows left and more shows will in the future"
Hemlock Grove,"Such a fun, weird ass show."
Hemlock Grove,That shitty show from like 10 years ago?
Hemlock Grove,That’s was a weird fucking show I watched only because it was one of the few Netflix originals around at the time
Hemlock Grove,"I have a month to watch it.  Is it worth it?  

Also, does this mean Lilyhammer is next?  I'm only half-joking.  I watched the first season of it when it dropped, many, many years ago now, and I actually really liked it.  Just had never got around to finishing it."
Hemlock Grove,I was surprised to know that it had been on the platform for as long as it had been.
Hemlock Grove,"The werewolf transformation in this show is so badass, the show itself was alright, not great but wasn't that terrible either."
Hemlock Grove,Well that sux. Guess I need to finish the series before it goes away now
Hemlock Grove,What color coffin would you like Netflix?
Hemlock Grove,"Netflix to horror series:  get off of my platform, you fucking kids!

Netflix to Cuties:  No, no, don't get up and leave yet, you fucking kids. ;)"
Hemlock Grove,"The first season was pretty good, but I can understand how they’d let the license lapse.

Knights of Sidonia was gone for awhile but it showed back up, this was a few years ago.

Anyways that’s my 2 cents"
Hemlock Grove,[deleted]
Hemlock Grove,"Never understood why netflix insist on ending series when 1 more season could have given it a ending. And then its longterm content, understand people not wanting to invest in a show that they know did not have a ending."
Hemlock Grove,"Does Netflix really even have good content anymore? I cancelled it as soon as they announced plans to include ads in a service I was paying for. I could get that with cable. I started using Tubi instead and found far more content worth watching. It was almost like watching classic Netflix, except I have to watch short well placed ads instead of paying for the service."
Hemlock Grove,"I never could get into this show, and I kinda wanted to because one of the ladies from BSG was on it."
Hemlock Grove,It wasn't even on Netflix where I live
Hemlock Grove,I never forgave them for killing the cat.
Hemlock Grove,"What about ""Lilyhammer""?!"
Hemlock Grove,I remember this show being super hyped up because it was their second Netflix original after house of cards which was a massive hit n
Hemlock Grove,"I don't know why it is being removed, but it isn't really a good show to be honest."
Hemlock Grove,"This is stupid.  Yes it’s a meh show but it’s a Netflix made show.


Removing it is idiotic"
Hemlock Grove,Yeah. Netflix didn’t negotiate good deals initially. Overtime they started negotiating “cost plus” deals where they pay a premium to retain longer term rights. Shows like house of cards aren’t even Netflix originals in every country.
Hemlock Grove,"Exactly. I can’t speak to how Netflix has been licensing content recently, but I worked for a producer who sold some Netflix Originals back in 2013/2014 and the license term at the time was defined as expiring ten years after the first episode of the last season has premiered. A lot of “Netflix Originals” that no one is watching any more and aren’t actually owned by Netflix are going to be exiting the service over the next few years."
Hemlock Grove,"> Gaumont International Television

Doubt they can succeed at a new service. Will likely shop it around to see if anyone wants it.

Guess Narcos is next.
Then F is for Family?"
Hemlock Grove,"That's especially the case with their early originals because that was before they were making enough money to finance stuff themselves.

Other examples:  
House of Cards - Sony  
Orange is the New Black - Lionsgate  
Marco Polo - The Weinstein Company  
Narcos - Gaumont International (same company as Hemlock Grove)"
Hemlock Grove,"yeah they partnered with everyone, to make more shows."
Hemlock Grove,Narcos has a whole damn channel on Pluto.
Hemlock Grove,Narcos isn’t on Netflix anymore?
Hemlock Grove,"You know, it had a really satisfying conclusion. I realize it's not for everyone, but for a respin of the OG, Vampire, Werewolf, Frankenstein's Monster tales, I found it original and enjoyable."
Hemlock Grove,"The first season and half of season two was fun. After that, it seemed like the writers went, ""Screw canon"" and did whatever came to their heads. And most it was bad. Not even campy fun bad. Just.....*bad.*"
Hemlock Grove,"It's a pretty bad show, but it is hilariously weird some times"
Hemlock Grove,"It's not pirating, it's data archival and redundancy."
Hemlock Grove,"Do you really need to watch Hemlock Grove again?

Like really"
Hemlock Grove,"I had a fun time hate watching the first two seasons, Season 2 in particular gets batshit crazy towards the end, but the third season felt like they went out of their way to make the most dull and boring season they could possibly produce.

Lillyhammer is legitimately great tho, I was bummed when negotiations for the fourth season fell through."
Hemlock Grove,"That’s my major memory about watching the first season and maybe half the second “the badass werewolf transformation” too!!   I think it remains the best I’ve seen before or after.
  I thought the show had so much potential when it premiered, and was disappointed to 
have to admit to myself , it was too much of a mess to continue watching it."
Hemlock Grove,Probably red
Hemlock Grove,"From what I recall, the only reason Hemlock Grove was renewed for a third season was to give it a proper ending and they still blew it."
Hemlock Grove,"Especially for a genre show like this, the cost of making another season will **never** be recouped by luring more eyeballs to the show. I guarantee you that they have the metrics and projections saying exactly this.

Hell, The OA was a much more acclaimed show than Hemlock Grove, and fans were surprised as shit when Netflix pulled the plug after 2 seasons."
Hemlock Grove,"They plan to end all their unfinished shows with deepfakes…. /s

That’s why the residuals for the living actors will be shit."
Hemlock Grove,"Um, the ads will only be for a lower cost version of the service.  Not the one (you're pretending at least) to be ""paying for""."
Hemlock Grove,"Hemlock Grove was a show with mixed/negative reviews that hasn't really gained any kind of cult following,if anything if they could go back and change their deal for this show specifically they would have payed less and have their streaming rights to it lapse earlier."
Hemlock Grove,No way in hell they are going to let Narcos go to any streaming service.
Hemlock Grove,"Most of Netflix stuff is still produced or co-produced by outside studios. That's why shows like Sweet Tooth, Lucifer, The Crown or Umbrella Academy get physical disc releases, because they're owned by other studios, sort of like how a show will be produced by Universal but aired on Fox, Netflix is just the ""network"" airing it. Only a handful of shows belong solely to Netflix, like Stranger Things and I think The Witcher and Bridgerton."
Hemlock Grove,Lilyhammer - NRK1
Hemlock Grove,It was fun until the dragon shows up
Hemlock Grove,"I didn't like how the werewolf worked with the .. grows under the skin, explodes out and then eats the skin. It felt gross LOL"
Hemlock Grove,Yeah it was dope actually.
Hemlock Grove,I'm glad it's not just me that felt that way. I thought the first season was great and entertaining but I was done near the middle of season two and never went back to finish it.
Hemlock Grove,My only lingering memory is that I loved the pediatrician character. And that it was gross. That's about it.
Top Gear,My heart dropped for a second there... Thought the hampster finally died.
Top Gear,"sad for Sue, but cannot deny I got mega anxiety for a moment here"
Top Gear,Rip Sue
Top Gear,[deleted]
Top Gear,Hammond seems to be aging harder than the other two. I don’t know if it’s lifestyle or accumulation of injuries but he looks to be on a fast track. I presume May will be last because of tradition.
Top Gear,I can’t be the only one that got worried that one of the current ones died
Top Gear,[deleted]
Top Gear,Oh thank god i was worried for a second
Top Gear,"Imagine living your life, getting achievements, gathering mild fame. Then dying, only for the top comment on a news thread to say ""thank god it wasn't this other much more famous person"""
Top Gear,Yeah. Though I’ve always figured Clarkson will bite it first.
Top Gear,comments like this remind me why top gear fans are the absolute worst
Top Gear,That's Sue Barker
Top Gear,"I don't even know who the current ones are, ngl"
Top Gear,She hasn't been on the show for 30 years. If you're willing to wait that long everything is cursed.
Top Gear,It’s almost like driving fast is bad for your health
Top Gear,"She did not die during filming, what are you on about?"
Top Gear,Wrong *Top Gear*
Top Gear,A woman is dead my guy tf is wrong with you
Top Gear,He is the oldest
Top Gear,Clarkson will probably punch the Reaper thinking he's a producer
Top Gear,"Last words being: “Hammond, you idiot!”"
Top Gear,Ya. But he's going to become one of those immortal old man farmers now.
Top Gear,Oh man it's this whole thread lol. What a bunch of douchebags.
Top Gear,[deleted]
Top Gear,THE CURSE OF THE DOORS!
Top Gear,It's more the suddenly not driving fast anymore that's the problem.
Top Gear,"Statistically based on the shows presenters, that's not true. As none of them have died as a result of driving fast."
Top Gear,"None of them died during filming, you twit.

They call a show “cursed” if a lot of deaths or accidents surround it. The movie Poltergeist for example."
Top Gear,Doesn't crash as much though
Top Gear,Blithering idiot.
Top Gear,Not even remotely.
Top Gear,"Maybe we should have the brakes removed from most cars, for safety :)"
Top Gear,That’s what “big car” would have you believe
Top Gear,"Why you calling me names? 

And How this movie is even related to Top Gear?"
Top Gear,Holy shit were you just sitting here? That took you 30 seconds to reply to something after I didn’t get back here for more than an hour
Top Gear,"Yes, I was browsing reddit at the time of your reply. 

Nice that you ignored everything I wrote just to write that I replied fast and downvoted me lmao."
Top Gear,"Sorry I forgot this is a default sub. It’s not often I interact with certain people and it’s jarring. I’d say I hope you understand but, well, I’ll just leave it there"
Top Gear,"
You write comments as if you ate all the brains and you smarter than everybody else but can’t reply to simple questions."
Top Gear,"I’m not interested in cars at all. I know nothing about them 

But I watched every week when it was Jeremy, James and Richard. I haven’t watched since they left"
Top Gear,Without the 3 original it will never.
Top Gear,"the cars on top gear were the side show, the real reason people tuned in was the friendship between Jeremy, Richard and James. you know they got along after the cameras were turned off. The show was the adventures of 3 genuine friends. Yes it was scripted we all knew it was  but there were genuine moments of friendship and as they would say "" Cocking about""

Even the people they introduced us to, Sabine taking of her belt to shave milliseconds off a cargo Van going around the green hell, it's wasn't for entertainment, it's who she was, it was genuine love of anything with wheels and an engine.

this is what the 3 amigos captured

and

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOB5u2zz7ug](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOB5u2zz7ug)

The current show is good enough, it's good, the group of guys is competent, but it's not the Top gear fans know and love, put it this way if the new show as on and the old one was airing on another channel I think most people would tune into the old show. 

I'm not knocking Chris Harris or the other guys , I'm saying when it comes to top gear they are the B team"
Top Gear,Just watch the grand tour
Top Gear,Thoroughly enjoy watching Chris Harris' other stuff on YouTube.
Top Gear,"Never.

Jezza, the Hamster and Captain Slow made the show what it was."
Top Gear,I think if it wasn't for Paddy the show now would be just fine. Not saying it would rival the other trio but even now it's watchable again.
Top Gear,"> Chris Harris from “my mate Chris quite likes cars?”

How to show you don’t really know what you are writing about. Harris is the only one of the three who actually has any place on the show, being a long standing car journalist having written for Autocar and Evo magazines, and having his own high quality output on YouTube. He’s also a pretty accomplished racing driver and actually knows how to drive properly."
Top Gear,"the trio made the show, this trash will never come close"
Top Gear,"I…. Didn’t know it’s still going….

Sorry, it’s the trio that made top gear great.  I loved it and I wasn’t even a big car fan."
Top Gear,"BBC caught lightening in a bottle with the banter and chemistry, Richard, James and Jez had, and it´s unfair to expect the new crew to recreate that."
Top Gear,"There is no top gear, only grand tour"
Top Gear,"They should have canceled after Richard, James, and Jezzah left."
Top Gear,Is there any article from Guardian that isn't full with nothing but negativity and bitterness?
Top Gear,"So much typical Guardian manure. 

The show is still fun. It isn't the same and won't be the same. 

Guardian seems to take the position that, somehow, BBC didn't damage the franchise when they decided to be PC. They did. Irreparably. They've done it to Dr Who as well. But the God's of PC rule, and the actual consumer suffers. 

There is a cost for being PC. And all the biased shilling articles so common in  Guardian can't fix that."
Top Gear,[removed]
Top Gear,You can’t force chemistry like the original blokes have.
Top Gear,Hate to break it to you. They weren’t the original three. It took them a few years to find that formula.
Top Gear,"Exactly so, and well said, too."
Top Gear,"I agree. Harris is the only person on the cast that I really care about. They could just give him all the time and it would be a better show. As is, the current incarnation just feels like they are trying to copy old Top Gear instead of letting the new crew find their own voice. It's not bad but the show just doesn't have that ""it"" factor the original had."
Top Gear,[removed]
Top Gear,And Clarkson on his Farm is also pretty fun
Top Gear,"Clarkson did not leave, he was fired by the BBC for assaulting a producer."
Top Gear,"You are getting downvoted into oblivion but I don't disagree with you. The original show felt raw, like the hosts really didn't give a fuck (note: read up on how James May was fired from Autocar Magazine).

This comparison is overused nowadays, but I feel like it applies to the two versions of the show. The original Top Gear was a little punk-rock, it had an edge and felt unique. The new version feels like the BBC got it's little paws on it and produced the major label-styled pop-punk version of the show where all the edge was sanded off for mass consumption.

The show is still good and fun but it isn't great, like the old series was. So yeah, compared to the old series the new version is a failure but it's also unfair to compare any show to the old series because it was one of those once-in-a-lifetime events and nothing could live up to it. Hell, even the Grand Tour didn't live up to prime-Top Gear."
Top Gear,"Oh do shut up. 

Blerrhhhh PC culture blerh blerh blerh wokeness bleeeeeererr, leftistssssssssss."
Top Gear,Unexpected Stewart Lee
Top Gear,"I think a lot of people use 'original' to mean when it was rebooted in 2002. Even those first couple of series were a bit dicey, empty rooms with dads around the edges. But it got going properly the year after James May joined after getting rid of Simon Dawe...who I'd completely forgotten even existed.

The old TG team went to do Fifth Gear - Tiff Needell, Quentin Wilson, Vicky Butler-Henderson. It's definitely more for car people, like the original Top Gear was."
Top Gear,"I got bored when it became ""light entertainment"" then moved to 5th gear (Tiff)/Doug deMuro/Chris Harris."
Top Gear,It's hilarious I really liked it
Top Gear,"I'm sure Clarkson feels extremely punished by going over to Amazon, getting more money dumped on his head, while he gets to watch Top Gear struggle to pull in half the viewers it used to."
Top Gear,"He wasnt fired, they just didnt renew his contract"
Top Gear,Agreed these whiny anti woke people are such snowflakes.
Top Gear,Jason Dawe
Top Gear,Okay? You were wrong and I corrected you mate. I don’t really care zero about the move or it’s supposed merits.
Top Gear,"Indeed.

Anyone know who the fuck Simon Dawe is, then?"
Top Gear,Works in the shop down the road.
Top Gear,Swears he's Elvis.
Top Gear,"Dead from cancer in case no one wants to read the article, however it’s very vague and doesn’t say what type"
Top Gear,"She had Steve irwin levels of enthusiasm and love for what she did, plus a huge infectious smile. She will be missed."
Top Gear,The ford transit van around the ring with a terrified hamster is one of the all tine great Top Gear segments.
Top Gear,Really sad. I liked her a lot.
Top Gear,This is such a loss.  Her personality was so intoxicating.  My wife always loved watching any segments she was in.  She drove any vehicle to it's absolute maximum potential like she was born to do it.
Top Gear,Half of me was shocked she was so young and half of me was shocked she was actually that old.
Top Gear,she could take a 2.0L transit round the ring faster than all the rich boys in their supercars
Top Gear,"Sad, this hit me harder than most celebrity deaths in the past months for some reason."
Top Gear,Awful :(
Top Gear,"The day angels learned to fear blistering lap times.

&#x200B;

RIP"
Top Gear,Queen of the Ring. Godspeed.
Top Gear,Such a sad thing. She was wonderful and a superb driver
Top Gear,"Holy shit. This heartbreaking. 

She was one of the most effortlessly charming people on the planet.

The Queen is dead. Long live the Queen."
Top Gear,RIP Sabine. Honorary Brit.
Top Gear,“I do that time in a van”. RIP
Top Gear,When obits withhold type of cancer it’s usually cancer of the “private parts”. Colorectal especially. I wish this would all be de-stigmatized so that people get screened.
Top Gear,"she was awesome and an inspiration to all, very sad."
Top Gear,"In my imagination, Death came for Sabine more than two years ago. She looked him in the eye sockets, smiled, and said ""I'll race you at sunrise every day for another day of life."".

Tuesday she suffered mechanical failure."
Top Gear,"I feel like everyone knew she was sick except me. So this all came as a huge shock. The same shock I have felt for only a handful of people. John Young, Christopher Hitchens and Steve Erwin. I wanted to meet them all. 

She will leave a legacy as well."
Top Gear,"Jesus man. My uncle died 2 days ago from Cancer and Now her, Before that dude from Black panther. WTF man. it's like Cancer is everywhere I look."
Top Gear,"We named our daughter after her. She’ll grow up surrounded by car jacks, spare engines and dirty hands, may she love it every bit as much as The Queen did."
Top Gear,She was always a joy to see on the show. RIP
Top Gear,I will never forget the episode where she outdrives all the other presenters lap times  around the Nurburgring driving a minivan. A minivan!
Top Gear,"Goddammit. Fuck cancer. 

I'm missing her face and skill and laugh already. 

Here's my favorite video of her doing what she was known for: crushing the ring.

https://youtu.be/qnJOC_dDXzM

I'm going to go hoist one for her, I hope y'all join me."
Top Gear,Never forget...she beat Clarkson in a Ford Transit
The Get Down,"I think this is the first time Netflix has cancelled a show after one season, right?"
The Get Down,"not surprised considering the absolutely mammoth price of it

is it worth checking out? does it feel complete?"
The Get Down,190M for 1 season. What a mess. Makes Vinyl look tame. 
The Get Down,"$120 million a season?  What the shit?!

[Here's a recent article about the most expensive Netflix original shows.](http://www.cheatsheet.com/entertainment/expensive-netflix-original-tv-shows.html/?a=viewall)  Reportedly, all five of the Marvel shows - *Daredevil*, *Jessica Jones*, *Luke Cage*, *Iron Fist*, and *Defenders* - were allotted a budget of $200 per season, or $40 million each.  *House of Cards* got $60 million per season.  *Marco Polo* got $90 million.

Why the hell does a show about teenage hip hop enthusiasts cost 3 times more than a show about superheroes fighting an army of ninjas?  The fact that it's more expensive than *Marco Polo* is especially egregious.  When you've got a show about high school kids in the 70's that's $30 million more expensive than a show about the Mongol Empire in the 13th century - a show that features a huge cast, tons of extras, exotic locales, and large-scale battle scenes - then you know someone's doing a shit job managing a budget.

I wouldn't be surprised if a key reason behind this cancellation is that Netflix execs were disappointed by how poorly Luhrmann handles someone else's money.
"
The Get Down,I think Netflix has reached the tipping point where they have invested so much into original programming that they will now have to be more selective about what shows they renew. My guess is renewals will now be decided by considering a combination of factors including viewer traffic/demographics and star-power attached to the show.
The Get Down,"Sad to hear, but knew it was coming. Just wasn't a huge hit in terms of social media, etc... which I assume translated into low viewership. That coupled with the huge budget it was probably an easy decision.

Loved the show though, it did a great job of turning a fairly dark/tragic subject about the birth of hip-hop turning it into a mostly fantastical musical about the hood, being a minority and self expression and growth. It wasn't perfect, but I really loved the shows style and flare for dramatic story telling all while being a solid musical that kept me watching.

Luckily it ended on a pretty clear note with not a lot of question left that really need answers beyond what anyone who watched can already guess, would have made this a lot harder for me personally. "
The Get Down,"I sort of enjoyed season 1, but it seemed like three different shows all struggling to be on the screen at the same time, and all failing. I wasn't going to watch Season 2. "
The Get Down,Lose money money lose money money lose money monneeeey
The Get Down,"I knew Netflix would cancel the get down.

But this show is great, and I love it.
Now I'm so sad."
The Get Down,"Too bad, the pilot was awful but it recovers quickly and culminates beautifully. A much better show than the first episode indicates 

edit: one of the best scenes of the show deserves mention (just wish it was in better quality):

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0SnTgwJyHw

really well edited"
The Get Down,"So....why was this show so expensive? I never watched it, but it doesn't seem very CGI intensive and none of the actors are particularly big names outside of certain ones and their meme status. How do they sink $120m+ into something like this?"
The Get Down,I thought it was good.. ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯ 
The Get Down,"I called this after the season ended. It's so damn expensive, and the show isn't the best thing I've ever seen. I love the show, but there's a lot better TV out there. But I will be sad we don't see any of those loose ends tied up"
The Get Down,"I feel like the get down had the same problem as Marco Polo. The center stage wasn't nearly as interesting as the stuff going on around it.

Marco Polo was filled with interesting characters, Marco just wasn't one of them. The Get Down was filled with interesting stuff about the birth of hip-hop, racial tensions, the need to get poor kids to realise they're the future, the terrible state of NY's poorer neighborhoods, graffiti culture and so on.

But I couldn't give a shit about the silly relationship drama, the 2-dimensional gangsters, Mylene's naivety and so on. 

I did really enjoy the contrast between that one actor's role as saxophone dad and his other more cynical role in mr. Robot."
The Get Down,An absolute shame. There wasn't anything else like it on tv or streaming. I hope we see the young cast members in more things in the future.
The Get Down,An alright show that cost 150+ million to make 1 season. I'm not suprised.
The Get Down,"This is a pretty big deal since they almost always do at least two seasons. Though the get down was two parts right? 

I never heard any rave reviews for it so didn't check it out. "
The Get Down,damn i actually really liked the show! now i really wanted to know what becomes of the characters. damn i hate this feeling of disclosure :( 
The Get Down,"Damn, I really enjoyed the first season of this. The music was great and this was probably my favorite Jaden role yet. It's pretty sad this didn't even get a second season considering Marco Polo did."
The Get Down,That's what happen when a show goes over budget. It cost $10 million an episode. And it was reported that even with that budget it went over budget.
The Get Down,"What a waste of money this show was for what was produced. Over a hundred and twenty million for 12 episodes. 

Jesus"
The Get Down,pretty much ended on its own anyway from what i remember of it
The Get Down,"....I just watched the second season a week ago. So I assume there won't be a third then?

E: so apparently the 2nd season is still the 1st season? I thought only Seven Deadly Sins would jerk me aroind that way."
The Get Down,For those asking season 1 was split into 2 parts. 
The Get Down,Good.
The Get Down,"It seems like everybody posting here missed the point of the article. The cost of the show was not what ended it. Baz Luhrmann's lack of interest is what killed it. It's a shame, I really enjoyed this one. Hope he hasn't chosen to do some unmemorable movie over this."
The Get Down,Dammit I liked this one. 
The Get Down,"I fucking love this show, this is a shame."
The Get Down,"More like The Let Down, amirite? Ehhhhhh?!


....I'll show myself out."
The Get Down,Probably my favorite show. And now its gone forever.
The Get Down,"If they aren't able to keep it on the production level of part 1, that's the only right decision. Part 2 was quite the disappointment."
The Get Down,"I didn't even realise Marco Polo had been cancelled. I really enjoyed that show, more so than The Get Down.

I especially enjoyed that Hundred Eyes mini movie."
The Get Down,The Get Down? How about The Let Down
The Get Down,So...can Marco Polo get a third season then?
The Get Down,I am glad. Grsnfmadtwr flash's story needs to be told better than what the Getdown tried to do. The Getdown was a mess. 
The Get Down,"What they should cancel is the annoying ""Because you watched (a movie completely unrelated to your original choice)""  bullshit. "
The Get Down,Not surprised.  That second part of the season was pretty bad.  I don't even remember if I was able to push through the whole thing.
The Get Down,How in the *fuck* did that show cost $120 million for 12 episodes?! That's a ludicrous budget. 
The Get Down,"Baz is the herpies of movie directing, and seeing his show get canceled really just made my day"
The Get Down,"All 3 fans of the show are pissed!

(it actually wasn't horrible but $120 million?)"
The Get Down,"Shame, I really liked a high production value/low episode count show for a change of pace. 

""He is the DJ that we call conductor, 'cause Shaolin Fantastic's a bad mother-"" "
The Get Down,"Hmm. I loved it  but honestly I didn't even think it was supposed to get s second season. It pretty much ended where it needed to, right before hip-hop became main stream ""thanks to"" the Sugar Hill Gang. They even allude to it in the closing text. It actually was an awesome complement to The Evolution of Hip Hop and that series also made me realize how true to the story The Get Down was.

Edit: spellings"
The Get Down,"So, this was basically all Bas Luhrmann's fault? I can whole heartedly believe it."
The Get Down,Cause is was shit... 
The Get Down,Ok. I didn't get through the first episode. 
The Get Down,I hope Bill Nye Saves the World is next.
The Get Down,I tried to watch this but just couldnt do it. 
The Get Down,I can't believe people keep giving Baz Luhrmann money.
The Get Down,Wait what. I could've sworn this show had 2 seasons?
The Get Down,"The Get Down was the biggest disappointment of the year. NY and hip hip in the 70s is one of the most interesting time periods with crazy interesting sub-cultures & characters and they made it a romance/fantasy, WTF. The guy from the Shield wrote it. The legit Shield writing in that dark violent period coupled with Baz on the musical choreography stuff while telling the actual stories. Mwah. That would have been the shit!"
The Get Down,[deleted]
The Get Down,The apocalypse is nigh
The Get Down,"I just hope Herizen Guardiola has a big career after this, that's all I want."
The Get Down,"This show can't possibly be more shitty than their other show, Between. Can it?"
The Get Down,... This was on netflix? I dont remember ever seeing it on there.
The Get Down,"I didn;'t mind it. The first half of the season turned out alright, it was a bit silly but had me engaged.

Started to watch the second half of the season, got to an animated segment and turned off. Read that there were a few of those and I don't think I'll ever finish it."
The Get Down,how could it possibly have been so expensive... a show that takes place in a real city... with real props....
The Get Down,Hopefully this is finally the golden nail in the diamond encrusted gold plated thrice-re-shot coffin of his career. 
The Get Down,"So if it's not his story, whose is it?"
The Get Down,"I really liked Part 1.  Part 2, I haven't been able to get past the second episode.  And those animated sections are terrible."
The Get Down,I thought there were 2 seasons?
The Get Down,"I really enjoyed this, but I'm happy that its over with. Better to let it end on a high note than drag it out. "
The Get Down,"Sad to hear, but not surprised. Really enjoyed season 1 and 2 was decent, but with a price like that it's not gonna roll."
The Get Down,"Can someone ELI5 for me, new episodes were released recently, I assumed they were season 2, were they just season 1 part 2?"
The Get Down,"Least surprising news ever.

Still, I liked the show so it's a bit of a bummer."
The Get Down,"Is it controversial to question if it was too niche? Despite all the advertising targeted at me the concept did not appeal, even the adverts were a turn off... hip hop in the Bronx is just not something I find interesting.  

The budget seems ridiculous... firefly was only $1 million per episode!"
The Get Down,It didn't help that the show wasn't very enjoyable. That's 120 million they could have spent on season 2 of limitless
The Get Down,the budget on this too ouch
The Get Down,"I hope someone else has the chance to pick it up, unlikely though.

I loved the show, and was really looking forward for a season two."
The Get Down,I watched the 2nd season of The Get Down.... How is it cancelled ?
The Get Down,Surprised to see this had a 190 million dollar budget considering I've barely fucking heard of it. 
The Get Down,Shit! One of my favorite Netflix shows. Sad. 
The Get Down,This was a great show! 
The Get Down,"Expected, but no less disappointing."
The Get Down,"I loved the show but I think you had to be into hip hop to really get into it. The story was kind of stupid and the acting was childish. It was full of such vivid colors and incredible music that I stuck with it. The second half of the first season felt more like a PG tv show until it wound down at the end, resulting in one of the weirdest and most unexpected episodes I think I've ever seen. Oh well. A very fun yet superficial show that cost entirely too much on a site that never cancels after the first season defied the odds"
The Get Down,"No surprise there. Couldn't quite figure out if it was a drama, a comedy or a musical. "
The Get Down,Part 2 sucked so bad but it wrapped up everything it could. Part 1 was awesome tho
The Get Down,"Well it was super expensive, not historically accurate, and romanticizes things that like, really aren't that romantic. I'm sure it would claim not to be doing that but with the style of its director that's just impossible to avoid. Seriously it's like someone said ""how can we hurry up the gentrification of the Bronx while simultaneously capitalizing on the success of glee, Jaden Smith, and white interest in hip-hop culture?"" But you know what someone ACTUALLY said? ""Yo The Great Gatsby was a good movie we should probably get that guy to make this and give him an unlimited amount of money"" and then you end up with Style Wars on Ice ft The Q continuum/Ed Koch."
The Get Down,I really need to watch this show... My grandfather is who the Jimmy Smits character is based on. Is it any good?
The Get Down,The saddest part of this is it will still show up on things to watch.
The Get Down,"Makes sense. It was super expensive and splitting the season in 2 was a dumb move. If they got it all in one go, less people would have fallen off. Alternatively it really could have just been a miniseries and wrapped after one season. It was a great show and I do love me some Baz Lurhman, but they really set themselves up for failure. "
The Get Down,Did people not like the get down? I thought it was really good. 
The Get Down,They shouldn't have split the first season in two parts. I actually enjoyed part 1 quite a bit and I would have continued watching the rest of the season if it was available. 
The Get Down,[deleted]
The Get Down,"they show didn't have ""it"". It was pretty boring tbh"
The Get Down,Ten million an episode? Is that the usual cost for a show?
The Get Down,"I really enjoyed this show. I'm in the minority, it seems. But the first season (it was split into two parts) did have a satisfactory ending."
The Get Down,No...... oh this hurts....
The Get Down,I really liked the show too. 
The Get Down,This show was so dope! It just got overshadowed with Stranger Things and Narcos on Netflix. No one I knew was watching or talking about this. 
The Get Down,"Disappointing, good show."
The Get Down,I've already seen 2 seasons of this show though?
The Get Down,Another Netflix show I tried and couldn't finish. It was like a parody of blacksploitation flicks that wasn't in on the joke. 
The Get Down,"""critically acclaimed""....yeeeeAH! Some unknown critic somewhere watched it and said,  ""Eh..it was ok."""
The Get Down,"I wanna down vote this but it's at 808. Fuck it, the show sucked ass."
The Get Down,This was an amazing show! Incredibly underrated! I'm actually furious
The Get Down,What a disappointment. I really enjoyed this show. One of the better Netflix originals in my opinion. Oh well.
The Get Down,"Huh.  I thought that was it anyway.  That last episode felt pretty final, much like the last episode of The Wire."
The Get Down,Good
The Get Down,Looks like Jackie blew most of the $190 Million on blow
LEGO Ninjago: Masters of Spinjitzu,You think that’s good you need to check out “Is It Cake?”
LEGO Ninjago: Masters of Spinjitzu,"Lego Masters is the single most entertaining and relaxing show I’ve seen in a while. It’s completely wholesome, and the content is rich.

After a long stressful day taking care of house, kids and work, my husband and I watch it to decompress, and it’s like an hour of therapy!"
LEGO Ninjago: Masters of Spinjitzu,I like this show. It's fun and doesn't take itself too seriously.
LEGO Ninjago: Masters of Spinjitzu,"It's almost the opposite of satire, it reimagines this format of show to be simpler, smaller, kinder, frankly better. I personally find its lack of reality tropes refreshing, its just a nice show, no sob story, no forced drama, no insults or pettyness. Will Arnett is a goofball host and the co-hosts hang around just enough to keep it serious. The contestants get the right amount of attention and they do try to keep things interesting about the builds."
LEGO Ninjago: Masters of Spinjitzu,"According to [this article](https://decider.com/2020/11/12/how-to-get-cast-on-lego-masters/), you have to submit an application to be on the show.   Part of it is filling out a questionnaire about your knowledge and history with Lego.   You also have to submit pictures of your best builds, builds with your teammate, and a video of why you would make a great contestant.  From there they pick whoever is they feel will make the best contestants.

Personally, I find the show to be pretty good, and it is going into its fourth season so I imagine it doing alright for the network."
LEGO Ninjago: Masters of Spinjitzu,Why all the hate for this show in this thread? It’s a fun family reality show. Go hate on TLC’s new one MILF Island instead
LEGO Ninjago: Masters of Spinjitzu,"I love LegoMasters. It's fun, Will Arnett is hilarious, and what they build is incredible. It's a breath of fresh air."
LEGO Ninjago: Masters of Spinjitzu,"I swear while at work with the TV on in the background I saw commercial where they used the term ""Bricked Up"".  Someone over there definitely is in on the joke."
LEGO Ninjago: Masters of Spinjitzu,"No way, Lego Masters is great (I'm literally watching it as I write this). It pokes fun at reality shows while avoiding the things I hate about reality competitions. There's no manufactured drama between teams, and the teams are actually usually really supportive of each other.

On top of that, the builds they create are *incredible.* I own a ton of Legos and I am consistently amazed at the stuff they build. As for who determines who is the best, it's subjective, just like who determines how someone is the best chef or baker."
LEGO Ninjago: Masters of Spinjitzu,"a very fun show! none of the nonsense sob stories or anything that tacky, it isn’t too serious and it’s fun to watch!"
LEGO Ninjago: Masters of Spinjitzu,"It's a fun show and I like that it lacks some reality tropes (eg. sob stories) but the show REALLY pushes the gimmick they've assigned each team. You two work in STEM-related fields? Ok, you're gonna wear lab coats constantly.

I believe they do take applications but they also reach out to a lot of builders on social media. I declined video chatting with a cast member but anyone I know who did it was told that the most important thing was a marketable gimmick. This isn't to say there aren't some amazing builders on the show--there absolutely are, especially among the final teams on each season--but the initial casting process is very much just about whether you and your teammate can be distinctive enough from other teams.

As for credentials for being the best Lego builders, it's obviously subjective, but if you do look up some of the work that some of the contestants have done in their own time, many of them have built impressive things. It's true, though, that there are a few teams each season who, while nice, fun people, seem like they were picked for the gimmick more than anything else."
LEGO Ninjago: Masters of Spinjitzu,"No joke, the Australian Lego Masters is infinitely more charming and enjoyable. Highly recommend."
LEGO Ninjago: Masters of Spinjitzu,"It is a bit meta when it comes to ""reality tv,"" but it's a pretty fun and wholesome show. It's basically like Great British Baking Show but with Lego. 

Hosted by Devon Banks."
LEGO Ninjago: Masters of Spinjitzu,The third season just finished and honestly it’s only gotten better over time. So many ridiculous jokes poking fun at the whole thing. They know we’re just here to laugh and see some cool legos.
LEGO Ninjago: Masters of Spinjitzu,My fam LOVES the show! Although we’re always saying “… What is Amy wearing??”
LEGO Ninjago: Masters of Spinjitzu,"I like the show but that said, season three had really weak builders compared to season one and two and it was disappointing. I hope they get really talented builders for the next season I really want to see amazing things I can't build myself not chunky brick built stick figures"
LEGO Ninjago: Masters of Spinjitzu,Are you new to reality tv?
LEGO Ninjago: Masters of Spinjitzu,I… really like Lego masters lol. The stuff they do is amazing imo. Will arnett is a cheesy as hell host and the jokes aren’t good but my wife and I have watched every season so far.
LEGO Ninjago: Masters of Spinjitzu,They keep asking me to be on! Should I go on for a season?
LEGO Ninjago: Masters of Spinjitzu,I like this show. Why the hate.
LEGO Ninjago: Masters of Spinjitzu,"It’s the only American reality competition show I follow.  Good-natured, good-humored and entertaining.  The builds are also pretty interesting.  Season 3 just ended this week."
LEGO Ninjago: Masters of Spinjitzu,I don't love Amy and Jaime but I love Will Arnett as a host.  The show can get cheesy but the teams are actually putting in a lot of work and I really enjoying seeing what they create.
LEGO Ninjago: Masters of Spinjitzu,"Man I love this show. The builds are *legitimately* impressive, especially later on in the seasons

You can really tell that all the contestants are legitimate lego people, because they're *definitely* not actors. They try and force it into like a reality show format, and everyone besides Will is so bad at acting, it loops around back to being great

Every time they do a ""ok now let's get a reaction shot of everyone laughing at Will's joke"", it looks like all the contestants are being held at gunpoint haha"
LEGO Ninjago: Masters of Spinjitzu,Australian lego masters is so so so much better
LEGO Ninjago: Masters of Spinjitzu,"What's the issue? It's a goofy reality competition show that doesn't take itself too seriously. They're building lego FFS. It's a fun family watch, if nothing else."
LEGO Ninjago: Masters of Spinjitzu,Yeah it’s ridiculous and that’s what it works.  Plus they build some baller shit.
LEGO Ninjago: Masters of Spinjitzu,They turned LUNCH into a show? I will have to discuss this during CLASS
LEGO Ninjago: Masters of Spinjitzu,"What a shite opinion lol, everybody is entitled to one, even if it is poorly described."
LEGO Ninjago: Masters of Spinjitzu,Most Lego content is satirical. It’s sort of the TV / movie niche they’ve carved out. I love how Lego Masters continues in that vein.
LEGO Ninjago: Masters of Spinjitzu,I love it! I started watching it last year with my kids. My oldest is really entertained by it.
LEGO Ninjago: Masters of Spinjitzu,"Love that show. Just really wholesome and really makes me look fondly at all
The time I spent building legos as a kid. It’s also awesome seeing the contestants push their skills. I will still always be blown away by the couple I think that had no real “engineering” design go into their bridge and they instead focused on aesthetics to compensate and they still built the strongest bridge. That was really cool to see."
LEGO Ninjago: Masters of Spinjitzu,"I'm on the current season and somehow, it just gets better!"
LEGO Ninjago: Masters of Spinjitzu,Season one is rough but entertaining. I’ve watched all 3 seasons and have enjoyed them all.
LEGO Ninjago: Masters of Spinjitzu,I love Lego Masters. I don’t know what the qualifications are but I do know a lot of the builders are really fucking good.
LEGO Ninjago: Masters of Spinjitzu,Lego Masters is a great family show!  Its good to celebrate popular hobbies that aren't physical.  I mean what people would you get?
LEGO Ninjago: Masters of Spinjitzu,"Sorry, but for me Lego Masters is the pinnacle of the ""reality"" television genre.

1. You get to see **amazing** Lego builds from ideation to creation! This is the primary draw for me. Some of the challenges are duds, but many are fantastic and creatively restrictive, forcing the contestants to come up with interesting solutions and builds.
2. All ""reality"" television isn't real. And this show is extremely well aware of that. The show *knows* it is a competition show about *building with Lego*. And leans hard into the *knowing* part.
3. Will Arnett is the perfect host for this type of reflective meta-comedy (see: BoJack Horseman/Arrested Development/Flaked). If you don't like that, then you won't like any of his parts of the show. I tend to really like most of his bits on the show."
LEGO Ninjago: Masters of Spinjitzu,"I watch it with my kids and we have a ton of fun. We are going to do a Lego building contest after this season and have them do themed mini builds. They are excited. My one gripe is how the teams obnoxiously identify with their hobbies or jobs. There is a Boston couple, a hockey couple, two nurses and two firefighters. And that is basically the extent of their personalities. The firefighter guys, for example, only talk about firefighting and all their builds are fire-themed. At one point this season there was a dog-themed challenge and they nearly crushed everyone getting the Dalmatian theme because “we’re firefighters.” It’s pretty innocent, but like come on, we get it already. The show just reduces everyone down to these simple little traits."
LEGO Ninjago: Masters of Spinjitzu,"I was super into it for the first season, but I hated the winning team so much that I never went back. The runner up team was 100x better than them"
LEGO Ninjago: Masters of Spinjitzu,Never seen the US version but the Australian one is so goddamn wholesome and fun.
LEGO Ninjago: Masters of Spinjitzu,The Australian version is the best!
LEGO Ninjago: Masters of Spinjitzu,You give them shit OP but look at the end of each episode.   They are pumping out works of art that I would have only dreamed about as a kid.
LEGO Ninjago: Masters of Spinjitzu,"My brothers were actually offered a spot on this! They prioritized finishing up school, but they had a number of builds features in magazines and a couple Lego-cons. I would have to imagine that’s how they got the attention of the talent scouts. Probably a similar situation with the rest of the contestants between actual applicants and people who are involved in the Lego community"
LEGO Ninjago: Masters of Spinjitzu,A lego show?? I gotta watch
LEGO Ninjago: Masters of Spinjitzu,"It really is like that. A lot of TV is like that now. 

Frankly, a lot of our **world** feels like a sick caricature at times"
LEGO Ninjago: Masters of Spinjitzu,"Love this show! It's creative, corny, and the contestants amd judges are genuinely likeable. Super nerdy, but what a fun show. We're up-to-date on the current season and are going to be bummed when it's over.
Btw...you want something fun? Check out ""Holey Moley"". That is hands-down our favorite. Absolutely hilarious."
LEGO Ninjago: Masters of Spinjitzu,"I love this show. But they present the teams like cartoon characters. On the current season, one of the teams is just “Canadians”. It’s a brother and sister that wear hockey jerseys that say “sports” and “team”."
LEGO Ninjago: Masters of Spinjitzu,"I love the Australian Lego master, US presenter was terrible the players were great, builds excellence.  I fast forward thru announcer parts"
LEGO Ninjago: Masters of Spinjitzu,My son is 12 and we love it. Not all TV is for all people.
LEGO Ninjago: Masters of Spinjitzu,"This show does everything right. Contestants aren't ""the best in the world"" in some cases, sure, but they do go through a vetting process to make sure they're not complete amateurs. For example, in season three (which I finished last night) there is a set of people who are both YouTube stars for lego. Like. Their YouTube channel pays for their lifestyle. And it's all about building lego. So I'd say they don't have a poor quality of contestant. Next, the show is high stakes without high drama. It's a lot of money, a trophy, and a bunch of Legos on the line, but none of the contestants or hosts create a dramatic atmosphere like you'd see in other shoes like this. It's wholesome, the contestants grow to respect and admire each other, and the twists or challenges continue to impress. I said to my fiance last night that I'd watch the show if it was just 5 groups of 2 making cool lego builds over and over forever. It's very good. If you can't handle how campy it is, you may not enjoy it, but if you can accept that it's silly, childish, and playful you'll like the whole thing."
LEGO Ninjago: Masters of Spinjitzu,"I watched the first season each week with my college roommates and neighbors, and we would always lose our shit at how awkward and uncomfortable it all felt. There was a duo that kept
yelling at each other, and we couldn’t tell if it was staged or not, but either way it was very weird."
LEGO Ninjago: Masters of Spinjitzu,"Lol I mean you’re so concerned about the credentials of participants….it’s a show about toys, maybe take a step back and think about it.


Fact is, it’s a fun show that doesn’t take itself to seriously. None of the participants take it too seriously. Why would they have a lowly “dad and son” combo that only build Lego in the weekend and aren’t professional Lego builders? I dunno maybe to give a healthy bit of diversity to the contestant pool and also show that being good at Lego is possible for anyone with an imagination"
LEGO Ninjago: Masters of Spinjitzu,Lego Masters has the hallmarks of a Jack Donaghy show if Kenneth ran 30 Rock.
LEGO Ninjago: Masters of Spinjitzu,I always though this was the Will Arnett show featuring Lego Masters.
LEGO Ninjago: Masters of Spinjitzu,When and where do they air “Lego Masters”? Is this a real thing? How has the internet not memed this to death??
LEGO Ninjago: Masters of Spinjitzu,Season 3 is bad
LEGO Ninjago: Masters of Spinjitzu,"I think the basic premise is give will arnett a stage and get out of the way so I’m guessing this is what he wanted. He’s the EP, star, and talent pool. I think it’s probably a question if that’s enough for fox to get a return and it seems like they’ve gotten at least a few seasons out of it"
LEGO Ninjago: Masters of Spinjitzu,Yes! Ugh. I have tried 3 times to get into that show. I just can’t do it.
LEGO Ninjago: Masters of Spinjitzu,"I could not even finish season 1. They spent way too much time on the builders drama and not enough time on the building of the actual pieces. I was going in expecting something like the great British bake off or holiday baking challenge, instead I got Lego Hell's Kitchen"
LEGO Ninjago: Masters of Spinjitzu,"My family and I have seen every episode, except, they like for me to fast forward through the entire show to the final reveal of everyone’s build. Its really the only bearable way to watch the show."
LEGO Ninjago: Masters of Spinjitzu,So many new game shows and reality shows feel this way. Masked singer? My 500 pound life. Milf island was basically foreshadowing.
LEGO Ninjago: Masters of Spinjitzu,I remember season 1. Wish I could hear that kid say “disco chickens and toupees” for the first time again.
LEGO Ninjago: Masters of Spinjitzu,"Jack would pitch “Lego Masterbators” where the contestants make erotic scenes out or Lego.

The judges are the boys from MILF island because that synergises backward overflow. Obviously."
LEGO Ninjago: Masters of Spinjitzu,I watch the Swedish and American versions and i find the American one has better judges and host (love Will Arnett) and the Swedish one has more talented builders
LEGO Ninjago: Masters of Spinjitzu,"I can only watch the show while actually building lego with my attention mainly focused on that, I once tried watching it on the couch when I was entirely focused on the TV and I think I got 3 minutes into an episode.

That being said, it's a great building companion show! The bridge episode in season 1 was so awesome, probably my favorite challenge of the entire series."
LEGO Ninjago: Masters of Spinjitzu,All they need is some gold.  Maybe in a briefcase.
LEGO Ninjago: Masters of Spinjitzu,"I’m pretty on the fence about Lego Masters, but this is definitely how I felt about Deal or No Deal; dumbest show ever IMO."
LEGO Ninjago: Masters of Spinjitzu,"I got to meet Manny and Nestor (father and son team) at a Brick Fest event and they were just awesome. I brought my kids and we shared anecdotes about building Lego with your family. 

Brick Fest Live, by the way is a total shady rip-off that hosts events in many US cities and is not affiliated with Lego in any way. Meeting these guys was cool but I don't recommend going."
LEGO Ninjago: Masters of Spinjitzu,Lego Masters is the best network show around right now (Ghosts is right behind it). I get so giddy when I see a new episode out.
LEGO Ninjago: Masters of Spinjitzu,"Ah,  LUNCH, yes I would agree too, thx for posting"
LEGO Ninjago: Masters of Spinjitzu,Such a great show.
LEGO Ninjago: Masters of Spinjitzu,One of the builders on that show has a youtube channel called “Cheesey Studios” and I absolutely love to watch it
LEGO Ninjago: Masters of Spinjitzu,Lego Masters is adapted from an Aussie tv show.
LEGO Ninjago: Masters of Spinjitzu,"IMO season one was good, but two just felt like it was missing something so I gave it up"
LEGO Ninjago: Masters of Spinjitzu,My coworker was on that show!  Not sure what season though.
LEGO Ninjago: Masters of Spinjitzu,I’d rather see a documentary-style presentation of actual pro lego builders than this basic forced drama bullsht for people with zero attention span
LEGO Ninjago: Masters of Spinjitzu,"Okayokayokay but I actually loved that show. It's *so dumb* but the contestants were a lot of fun and some of the stuff they made was awesome. 

9/10, would watch a second season. 10/10 if they changed out the host or idk, gave the man some acting lessons or constructive criticism."
LEGO Ninjago: Masters of Spinjitzu,"Is it.....cake? Love this show, the bakers, the judges...so much fun."
LEGO Ninjago: Masters of Spinjitzu,the host Mikey though makes me wanna jump in front of a train
LEGO Ninjago: Masters of Spinjitzu,Is It Cake is amazing
LEGO Ninjago: Masters of Spinjitzu,Is it Cake was decent actually. Check out Easy bake off though. That show is literal tv garbage
LEGO Ninjago: Masters of Spinjitzu,It’s so good. And I genuinely laugh quite a bit at the simple jokes. But I’m a big Will Arnette fan haha
LEGO Ninjago: Masters of Spinjitzu,"100%

Arnette is everything I want and more

I love that they got actual Lego Masters to be the judges instead of B tier celebrities that voiced a Lego character once. The judges are a bit spotty as TV personalities in S1 but they get a lot better and they really care about this work."
LEGO Ninjago: Masters of Spinjitzu,"One of the only shows I watch regularly with my 12 year old. The family loves to sit down and watch it together. We also like Holey Moley, but the jokes get a little more risque"
LEGO Ninjago: Masters of Spinjitzu,If you love Lego Masters please check out Domino Masters too! One of the coolest things I’ve ever seen
LEGO Ninjago: Masters of Spinjitzu,"For real, I love Lego Masters.  Of course it's cheesy - I thought it's also obviously self-aware of the level of cheese.

Ironically it does get a little serious when a build goes awry.

I think they cast people just by canvassing lego forums, etc.  Everyone involved is a pretty good builder given that this is all free building."
LEGO Ninjago: Masters of Spinjitzu,The Aussie one on Tubo is even more wholesome. It’s very uplifting and light. Hamish and Brickman are a very likable duo. I’m on season 3.
LEGO Ninjago: Masters of Spinjitzu,"I love how it doesn’t push drama or sweaty competition. They’ll joke about fake drama just for fun, but it’s never a dramatic, emotional mess. Everyone is so wholesome and lifts each other up while having a ton of fun."
LEGO Ninjago: Masters of Spinjitzu,Part of what I enjoy about it is that it pokes fun at the reality competition format
LEGO Ninjago: Masters of Spinjitzu,Completely agree. I find it very entertaining and fun. Will Arnett is the perfect host for it.
LEGO Ninjago: Masters of Spinjitzu,"No sob story, yes! I didn’t even think about it but AGT and the like became so unlikable because of it"
LEGO Ninjago: Masters of Spinjitzu,The dude committing so hard to his choice of subjects that he dove through the table this season was one of the funnier things I’ve seen in a long time.
LEGO Ninjago: Masters of Spinjitzu,Was there not a sob story though? I think a few episodes in there’s one that’s pretty on the nose
LEGO Ninjago: Masters of Spinjitzu,"The casting directors do also reach out to people on social media, so it's not just application-based (though it may vary season-to-season; I just know I was contacted for season three)."
LEGO Ninjago: Masters of Spinjitzu,"Their casting people also reach out to people who post pictures of their own Lego creations online. 

Having said that, there’s a HUGE emphasis on having teams that can be easily identified (i.e. The Doctors, The siblings, etc), it’s not emphasizing the Lego skills as much."
LEGO Ninjago: Masters of Spinjitzu,I wonder who will win!  Debra or Deborah?
LEGO Ninjago: Masters of Spinjitzu,I caught a chunk of the Australian one a few months ago and it was the most wholesome reality show I’ve ever seen. Just passionate people building and sharing their joy of Lego.
LEGO Ninjago: Masters of Spinjitzu,My kids love the show
LEGO Ninjago: Masters of Spinjitzu,"I'll wait for Seinfeld Vision, thanks."
LEGO Ninjago: Masters of Spinjitzu,"There's a sizable percentage of reddit users who seem to think tv shows shouldn't be fun. 

I don't know what the big problem is about a bunch of people who are good at building things with lego being on a show where they build things with lego and sometimes the things blow up."
LEGO Ninjago: Masters of Spinjitzu,I thought it was called MILF Mansion...literally sounds like porn.
Grace and Frankie,'The Dragon Prince' can be added to that list.
Grace and Frankie,"I love Disenchantment so I hope it gets more seasons.

And Sex Education is great. Keep it coming."
Grace and Frankie,"""You"" is missing - Got renewed for season 3
Should also be more specific that this list does not include any foreign language series, many of which are very popular (ie. Money Heist).  Also, you're missing their reality series, also which are very popular (ie. Selling Sunset, Queer Eye, etc.)"
Grace and Frankie,I'm still not okay with them canceling I Am Not Okay With This. And GLOW too.
Grace and Frankie,">Russian Doll - Pending. Doesn’t need a third season.

What?
It was pitched as a 3 season show. Hopefully season 3 comes a lot quicker though."
Grace and Frankie,I don't understand why this isn't a good thing? Shows shouldn't be dragged on forever.
Grace and Frankie,Netflix seems like it's giving up. Pretty pathetic when you boil it down like this.
Grace and Frankie,"Didn't realize ""Big Mouth"" had that many seasons already, I'm guessing they do more than 1 per year?"
Grace and Frankie,"by comparison..

Prime Video has 3: The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel(2017), Jack Ryan (2018) and The Boys

Hulu has 2: Wu-Tang: An American Saga, Ramy

Paramount+ has 1: Why Women Kill

Disnet+ has 2: The Mandalorian and High School Musical

Apple+ comes in strong with 6:  For All Mankind, See, Servant, The Morning Show, Truth be Told, Ghostwriter

depending how you want to define ""HBO Max originals"" (as its own service?) you could say that it has zero because there were no HBO Max originals before 2020

for reference: everything shown here except the first 2 debuted in 2019"
Grace and Frankie,The last kingdom is getting a movie to end so that kinda counts
Grace and Frankie,"Isn't Bridgerton a Netflix original that's signed on for multiple seasons? I thought they were committing to 8 seasons

>I’m predicting Witcher as it’s their most popular IP atm.

Nope, I'm pretty sure that's Bridgerton

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_most-watched_Netflix_original_programming"
Grace and Frankie,"The Witcher is definitely not Netflix’s strongest bit of IP. It is behind Bridgerton, Money Heist, Stranger Things, and Squid Game. It is the most popular show from that crop of shows you mention so it will probably stick around but I doubt it will get past 4-5 seasons. Netflix do not seem interested in long running shows nowadays. It might get a few spin-offs though like Stranger Things is rumoured to be getting. 

Netflix are not the only Network moving away from long running series. Fellow long term streamers Amazon and Hulu are not big on them either. Amazon have only 4 shows on the roster that started in 2019 or earlier (Jack Ryan, The Boys, Ms Maisel, and Modern Love) while Hulu also only have 4 shows (Handmaid’s Tale, Ramy, Dollface, and Wu-Tang). 

Disney+ seem to place a high emphasis on miniseries so I’d not bet on too many of their shows going past 3-5 seasons at most. 

HBO are the best bet for long running shows but even they look to be switching to a shorter season model. Euphoria, Succession, and Westworld are the dramas from 2019 or earlier and all likely have a season or two at best in them before they conclude. 

FX are fairly solid but are wrapping a lot of their 2019 or earlier shows soon. The exception to the rule at FX seems to be the anthology series. Probably because it is how they get to keep Ryan Murphy making shows for them! 

I’m not keen on the idea of shorter seasons but it does seem to be becoming the norm in the streaming era!"
Grace and Frankie,Witcher costs a fortune to make. I think Netflix is going to cut back on the overly expensive tv shows. They get more hype and attention with the docu-reality shows. Less high concept and pricey production for cheaper and easier reality.
Grace and Frankie,I was so angry when they cancelled Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance. One of the most creative shows I’d seen in years.
Grace and Frankie,"Dont 4get netflix has more shows in production currently.


Witcher spinoff and the avatar live action show are 2 to come to mind without putting much thought into it"
Grace and Frankie,What about Cobra Kai?
Grace and Frankie,Why do you not care about any shows that started in 2020?
Grace and Frankie,"You’re missing a lot I’m sure- Top Boy, You, The Cuphead Show, Arcane, Pacific Rim, Inside Job off the top of my head and there must be loads more

Edit- you said from the last decade... but that still includes at least Top Boy and You. And I think Last Kingdom is getting a film. And there’s Never Have I Ever which I think started last decade."
Grace and Frankie,"You missed Master of none, I think.  That is still sometimes airing new seasons"
Grace and Frankie,"Friends from College being cancelled hurt, despite its flaws."
Grace and Frankie,"This list is the problem with Netflix. They just don’t have any shows that make it past 2 seasons. I know Netflix often signs contracts for 2 seasons and it starts getting expensive past the 2nd season, but as a consumer, I am way less likely to give one of Netflix’s shows a chance now because they have cancelled almost every single show I have paid and enjoyed over the last 5 years. 

I’m incredibly happy to see shows like ozark and hopefully umbrella academy get a proper end, but unfortunately almost none of the shows you start on their platform get that treatment."
Grace and Frankie,You forgot I Think You Should Leave. First season came out in April 2019 and Netflix just greenlit Season 3 the other day!
Grace and Frankie,"Really hope Love Death and Robots goes for a long time.
There's so much potential with the amount of different teams putting together each story. There's an endless amount stories to tell."
Grace and Frankie,Yeah the dragon prince will end after 7 seasons but hopefully season 4 will come out at the end of this year or at the start of next year
Grace and Frankie,"Disenchantment apparently is getting a 5th season next year but I wouldn’t be surprised if that was its last. 

For me and my wife, the show has completely faded in terms of enjoyment. It’s not really funny anymore, and I don’t think groening does season long plots well at least from a comedy standpoint."
Grace and Frankie,I think “You” doesn’t count as exclusive to Netflix as it was a Lifetime series for S1
Grace and Frankie,Money heist is concluded though right?
Grace and Frankie,I don't think they are counting shows that started elsewhere before Netflix got ahold of them
Grace and Frankie,GLOW is down to covid causing too long of a filming delay. The creators were critical of NF for other stuff but defended them on that. Apparently all the cast got paid in full for the season too despite only filming a couple of episodes.
Grace and Frankie,I'm still pissed they cancelled Everything Sucks
Grace and Frankie,IANOWT was addicting from start to finish & they just threw it away. Sucks
Grace and Frankie,I'm still upset
Grace and Frankie,[deleted]
Grace and Frankie,Wasn't saying it isn't. Just like to make lists and thought it was quite interesting how few Netflix originals from last decade remain.
Grace and Frankie,No 1 season per year. They've been airing since 2017.
Grace and Frankie,Hulu also has Handmaid’s Tale and Dollface
Grace and Frankie,Would titans or pennyworth not count for hbo?
Grace and Frankie,Paramount+ also has The Good Fight!
Grace and Frankie,"Does Star Trek Discovery not count for Paramount+? I know it started on CBS ALL ACCESS, but if that's the case, Why Women Kill shouldn't count either."
Grace and Frankie,"Last Kingdom was never a Netflix original. BBC was the original owner, then they lost the rights after Season 2 because of budget, and low viewership, meaning Netflix swooped in, and became full owners in Season 3. Plus the show also technically ended so it wouldn’t count regardless in the context of this list. 

Destiny is all, the movie looks dope."
Grace and Frankie,"I believe Bridgerton came out in 2020, hence not being included on this list.  Otherwise, you are correct"
Grace and Frankie,"Shondaland wants 8 Bridgerton seasons but Netflix has only approved 4 so far (after S1 success), but then S2 did beat S1 which was a record itself so it might get more."
Grace and Frankie,"> [The Witcher] might get a few spin-offs though like Stranger Things is rumoured to be getting. 

It already has them. The Witcher: Nightmare of the Wolf (animated movie) is already out. The Witcher: Blood Origin (live action miniseries) is coming this year. A new unnamed animated movie and an unnamed animated series focused on younger viewers are officually in the making. A couple more spin-offs are rumored."
Grace and Frankie,Also the sandman. I’m really looking forward to that cuz it could be quite good
Grace and Frankie,Originally a YouTube red original. Netflix bought the rights to it.
Grace and Frankie,I do. I just thought it was interesting how few shows are left from 2010-2019
Grace and Frankie,"Top Boy was a Channel 4 (in U.K. original). It only became an official Netflix original in 2019. You originally aired on Lifetime, and only really became a Netflix original from Season 2 onwards. Cuphead Show, Arcane, Pacific Rim, and Inside Job all aired from 2021 onwards."
Grace and Frankie,"Master of None might have been silently cancelled. No updates in a year, and there didn't seem to be a need to tease a season 4."
Grace and Frankie,Yh it’s a shame I agree.
Grace and Frankie,"Good point, it has just been renewed, so now there are 13 shows remaining!"
Grace and Frankie,"Yeah - I can watch seasons 1 and 2 multiple times but season 4 was a hard watch for me. I wished they could have stuck with the charming alcoholic princess and her 2 sidekicks navigate fairy tale kingdom shtick that, for me at least, was the show’s selling point."
Grace and Frankie,But it's a Netflix exclusive now.
Grace and Frankie,I read an article this morning about the Korean version which said Spanish one was done.
Grace and Frankie,I just wish they could have put it on hiatus instead of outright cancel it.
Grace and Frankie,Right???  I saw serious potential for overlap between fans of IANOWT and Stranger Things.  And they left it on such a cliffhanger!!!  Gahhh!  I am not okay with it.
Grace and Frankie,"Season 2 wasn’t great, but they intend to make 3. Up to Netflix if they get renewed. https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/general-news/natasha-lyonne-why-russian-doll-will-be-3-seasons-one-writing-mistake-1229415/"
Grace and Frankie,Oh it is interesting for sure. Also reminds me I need to get into The Crown.
Grace and Frankie,"they are edge cases, depends on exactly how you are defining the criteria

>Pennyworth is an American television series that premiered on July 28, 2019, on Epix. In October 2021, the series moved to HBO Max for the third season.

>Titans premiered on October 12, 2018. The first and second seasons were released on DC Universe; the third season premiered on HBO Max."
Grace and Frankie,"Titans isnt exclusive to HBO max, i believe its on netflix in most international countries"
Grace and Frankie,"Fair enough, and I figured that's probably why it was left off. Thanks for the clarification."
Grace and Frankie,"I gotcha, just was wondering if you were losing hope in Netflix. I can definitely understand that with the end of an era of shows but there is a few in this new decade that are pretty great so far."
Grace and Frankie,"I don’t really understand the point of this post. You seem to have set an arbitrary restriction on the shows you include in order to criticize Netflix, but in reality they have loads of continuing and very popular shows. No one cares where You started, only who has it now and how good it is. Another weird anti Netflix Reddit post to add to the pile."
Grace and Frankie,"This would really suck. Season 3 was a big departure for the show, but season 1 and 2 are solid."
Grace and Frankie,"To be fair there was also a long silence between season 2 and 3.   
(Because Aziz was accused in MeToo stuff if I rememeber correctly).  
That's probably also why season 3 was basically a completely different show."
Grace and Frankie,"It is now, but currently being a Netflix exclusive doesn’t mean that it was exclusive to Netflix throughout its run, which is what OP was studying"
Grace and Frankie,"With a cast that big, it would have been astronomically expensive to put on hiatus and the show was probably just at the threshold of getting renewed as it was and couldn’t take the added expense."
Grace and Frankie,[deleted]
Grace and Frankie,"IIRC it had already been renewed and production had even started.  That said, I don't work in the industry, so what do I know?  I'm just a bitter fan that fell in love with the stupid thing lol.  I'll get over it... *eventually.*"
Grace and Frankie,"Season 2 wasn't as good as season one but it was still better than 90% of the other stuff on television. It wasn't like Dexter, it didn't go from a 9/10 show to a 3/10 show, it went from a 9/10  show to a 7 or 8/10 show. 


Also Natasha Lyonne created entertaining and interesting roles before Russian Doll and I'm sure she will after it's over, so not really a one hit wonder."
Grace and Frankie,"They did, but then Covid jacked up the cost way too high to justify the numbers it put out."
Grace and Frankie,"I mean come on, you gotta have the 9 to 5 reunion"
Grace and Frankie,"My wife loves this show and loves Dolly Parton, she may explode when I tell her this."
Grace and Frankie,"I will miss this show when it ends, one of my favorite shows on Netflix. Jane Fonda and Lily Tomlin are truly an amazing duo"
Grace and Frankie,"Dolly Parton was the first full first-last name combo my son ever said. Every night he says good night Dolly Parton after we read one, or several, of the books “she” sent us."
Grace and Frankie,FINALLY! I've been waiting since season 1 for this.
Grace and Frankie,"It’s about time!  My wife and I were hoping she would’ve played Coyote’s mother earlier in the run of the show, but at least it’s happening now"
Grace and Frankie,She poured herself a cup of ambition.
Grace and Frankie,Now we need Dabney Coleman to show up.
Grace and Frankie,"I’m excited for a finale season but I thought grace and Frankie ended forever ago? I love the show and Dolly, so I’m not upset, just confused"
Grace and Frankie,About darn time!!
Grace and Frankie,Anything with Dolly Parton I upvote; no need to read the article
Grace and Frankie,Delightful!
Grace and Frankie,Pete Davidson will have to update his rap
Grace and Frankie,Can’t wait to see this 🙌🏽🙌🏽
Grace and Frankie,Yes! I’ve been waiting for that. Love her 💕
Grace and Frankie,I swear I've heard threats of Grace and Frankie's final season from the second episode. I'll believe it when Netflix stops being traded on NYSE. (Because Jane and Lilly will never ever ever die)
Grace and Frankie,"Now they need Harvey Keitel for an Eagle's Wing reunion.

https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0079094/"
Grace and Frankie,"Oh man I have been saving this show for a monster beginning through end binge, after years of holding off Netflix plays this card??… well played…"
Grace and Frankie,Gotta watch it now
Grace and Frankie,"Bringing back the 9 to 5 reunion, I love it!!!"
Grace and Frankie,Literally just talking yesterday about wanting her to join for the final season. Super excited for this :D
Grace and Frankie,Not invited: Unknown Hinson
Grace and Frankie,We love this.
Grace and Frankie,Dollys bazookas never cease to amaze me
Grace and Frankie,And THAT is how you boost viewership.
Grace and Frankie,Finally!
Grace and Frankie,Love dolly 🥳
Grace and Frankie,Awh that’s great
Grace and Frankie,Do they refer to Dolly as a streamer in the article?
Grace and Frankie,I thought they already had their final season. Good to hear.
Misfits,"It's crazy to me that ""Guns for Hire"" was originally more ""action-y"", as it's definitely the stand out of the series for me and a big part of that is because of how dramatic and emotional it is.

Also I'm dying to know what Bowie song they temped in for the final sequence."
Misfits,This was really fun to see the process of making music for the show. I do think sometimes there was a bit too much of a song break in episodes but overall am very impressed with such an original soundtrack by a show. Wish we got more oc ghese from tv shows
Misfits,"I loved the very present music in S1, but since the tracks aren't bland that means taste of music is going to have a bigger effect on if you vibe with it or not. Like my friend hated the rap songs in one of the episodes, but I thought they were so good. 

In the end I think it makes for better art. Even if it's not for everyone, it comes from a place of inspiration and passion and the people who love it are going to love it even more."
Misfits,"It's also what Riot had been doing pretty well before this. I don't play the game anymore, but I'm still subbed to their channel because they make some great music (collabs and all) as well as some really great animated shorts. I think a lot of people were legit surprised they finally made an animated show since it had been speculated about for years."
Misfits,"I agree, I respect that they went for bold choices, they could've just picked more inoffensive music choices and not put in the tons of effort to try to make the perfect song for the major scene in each episode, timed to the visuals. But, going that extra way just shows how much they cared for the show, and even if each track didn't land perfectly for everyone, when it did land it made it all the more better."
Misfits,"Catching up on Interview with the Vampire. What a fantastic show, quality across the board, not sure why I slept on it."
Misfits,"just wanna say i look forward to these threads every week. i probably wouldn't have watched **extraodinary** if it wasn't for all the people that mentioned it! 

starting **poker face** now and watching **the last of us** weekly."

Misfits,"**Dark**

I am absolutely floored by this show. This is the kind of show that is so well-written, acted, and paced…its inspiring. I’m actually not sure what to watch next because this feels like such a one of a kind treasure. 

Like a lot of others, I decided to check this out after watching 1899 and I had been curious because I had heard great things. My God…1899 is like the person you go on a couple dates with who inadvertently introduces you to the love of your life. I’m bummed 1899 got cancelled but to be honest after watching Dark…I totally get it. The difference in quality is noticeable. I’ll definitely be on board though for anything these creators come out with."
Misfits,Just finished a rewatch of Patriot. What a terrific show that was done dirty by a bad name and no marketing. That show is double great.
Misfits,Is Parks and recreation worth watching? Need some really funny shows to watch.
Misfits,"**Cunk on Earth** - I'm dead inside and can't remember the last time a show made me laugh out loud this much. So many impeccable deadpan-delivered one liners. I wish I hadn't binged it all so quickly.


**Extraordinary** - Light hearted comedy with superpower twist. Was quite enjoyable and funny in some parts.


**Poker Face** - weekly watch. I like the non-commitment of weekly mysteries, superb guest stars, and Natasha Lyonne of course."
Misfits,"Tokyo Vice - OH yes. Love me some Michael Mann. Great atmosphere, locations, gorgeous cinematography and a very interesting story so far.
The Japanese cast is doing a phenomenal job and I find all the Yakuza stuff fascinating too. A very well made and different show. Plus this show has one of the best looking title intros I ever saw with great music as well."
Misfits,"Was able to knock out two mini series in 48 hours and both were very entertaining

* Under the Banner of Heaven: I slept on this one. If you like detective shows like True Detective or Mare of Eastown this one fits right in. Not as good as TD but still very very solid.
* Black Bird: Was really entertaining, however not without its flaws. I feel like some of the story telling devices they used were just filler (mob, guard, and the riot for example). While they did add tension I can't help to think they were struggling to find more filler to fill up the 6 episodes. I would have liked to see more of Larry in those times. Also a few instances of ""dead people"" with their eye lids moving. Other than than, really strong series and great acting. Worth a watch if you have 6 hours to spend. I watched all 6 in one setting so it was very entertaining."
Misfits,"I was gonna make a thread for this question but I was redirected here. what shows are a MUST WATCH when it comes to television? I've been on a spree of watching relevant, extremely influential shows that are highly loved and iconic. examples of the shows I've watched in the past year:

Breaking Bad, Better Call Saul, Game Of Thrones, The Walking Dead, The Office, Community, Black Mirror, Squid Game, Lost, Stranger Things... (I've watched the top animes and cartoons).

I'm not really looking for anymore comedies though. I know Seinfeld and all the other ones are so iconic but I'm looking for the more serialized shows. I've been redirected to the sopranos, the wire, mad men... any recs on where to go next or any other recs I should check first?"
Misfits,"Started watching vikings, currently at s3 and really enjoying it, I've slept on it for so long"
Misfits,"**Mayor of Kingstown** (**Paramount +**)

Great Crime / Prison System corruption show.

Jeremy Renner is a fantastic lead in this.  ( If you go along for the ride, the network of character relationships is a well-developed Web, and likely influenced by The Wire to an extent )"
Misfits,"Jason Segel is acting his ass off in the latest episode of Shrinking, I haven't laughed this hard in a minute. The whole cast is 10/10"
Misfits,"Lockwood and Co is a fun urban fantasy show.

Pokerface is okay, I'm not really enjoying the structure, but the actress is solid.

Interview with the vampire was fantastic. I can't wait for the second season. I didn't want to watch it originally because I really enjoyed the book, but they did it justice."
Misfits,"Mr Inbetween is the best show hardly anyone has watched.  

All Creatures Great and Small is a lighthearted wholesome veterinarian dramedy you didn’t know you needed."
Misfits,"This was a week of New Zombies vs. Old Zombies for me.  

Now, I'm a big zombie fan.  You all should know this.  I write about zombies all the time.    I've seen every zombie movie made since 1968's George Romero classic Night of the Living Dead and I watched the entire Walking Dead franchise.  And I'm about to watch it again.  

So for fun, nostalgia, I don't know, I started watching **The Walking Dead** again from Season 1 Episode 1.  Maybe I longed for the good old days of 2010 when the world was simple and our only real worry was the coming Mayan Apocalypse?  Maybe it's because it's on Netflix and I was too lazy to look for anything else and it popped up right after I finished Wednesday?  Either way, I started down that burned black highway into Atlanta and the Walking Dead franchise, and friends, it was like going to a reunion.  It was like seeing old friends for me.  Those first four episodes were really quite shocking!  Gore!  Violence!  The ""Hard R"" word!  I had forgotten how intense and fast paced that first season was while still making time for interpersonal conflict and resolution and character development.  Having watched the entire series already (parts of it twice) I can see in those early fresh-faced interactions, the harder, meaner characters some of them will become.  And, of course, we get to see those early friends we had just begun to appreciate fall to the virus or Walker bites or their own despair and folly.  I did not expect to be so swept up into this world again even after watching it as it aired and becoming so jaded by it.  If there's an age of innocence for zombie fiction, I think the first season of The Walking Dead was it.  

Even though they aren't ""zombies"" per se, I had to get into **The Last of Us**.  And I am so, so into it.  All you doubters on casting - you were wrong.  You were DEAD WRONG.  Pedro Pascal and Bella Ramsey are perfect here.  I don't care how close they are to the game characters - they are the perfect pair for the television version of this story.  

Nick Offerman and Murray Bartlett did not just give a great portrayal of two characters from the video game theirs was a great episode/mini-movie PERIOD. I love that this episode can stand alone as its own little story as well as provide impetus and resources for Joel and Ellie.   

Words were said the other day about Melanie Lynskey as Kathleen, the leader of a partisan outpost who took over a Federal QZ in Kansas City and to those haters, I say FUCK YOU.  Melanie Lynskey is perfect for this role.  She has a midwestern lady look.  Her face is gentle but she exudes authority.  Looking at this woman, you know you can't tell her no.  Pre-apocalypse you could not have told her ""No, I cannot fill in for Margie at the PTA booth at the basketball tournament on Saturday"" and you sure as heck would not be able to tell her ""No, I'm not going to hunt down the guy who killed your brother"" post apocalypse.  Her Kathleen works because she looks unassuming.  

Certain people underestimate the power of subtlety and coercion and Lynsky's Kathleen shows (in the brief bit we've seen her so far) that she has mastered that power.  She's a mild looking Kansas woman yet she commands a partisan force that controls a fortified Kansas City.  That is impressive because she didn't have to go full GI Jane or Linda Hamilton to do it.  She motivated with the force of her will and that makes her (I hope) a powerful and entertaining villain."
Misfits,"There are too many praises for Last of US already BUT I still need to praise the guest stars.

Ep 3 Bill and Frank are good but I think this episode Sam and Henry are just as good if not better.

All contenders for awards for sure."
Misfits,**Clarkson's Farm** Season 2-  really enjoyed this season.  Pretty amazing at the hell that he has to go thru just to provide food for folks that really want to enjoy his farm.  Very good season and Gerald is even more confusing.  Kaleb is a superstar.  Its a shame that shows like this dont get talked about much in fear of getting a downvote..  its not top tier by any means but its very heartwarming and funny and a very good look at country life and what it takes to be a farmer and feed us.  That local council that wants him to fail is so shameful.. so Jeremy says fuck em' and gets it done (sort of).
Misfits,I just watched the first 5 episodes of Normal People because I couldn't sleep and it seems like I picked the wrong show since I've cried through all 5 episodes. I really love the two main characters.
Misfits,"I finally gave **Euphoria** a try. It's an amazing piece of tv. Zendaya is fantastic, to say the least. But that show is heavyyyyyyyyy. It does take a toll into you. So much to relate. I'm really into it!"
Misfits,[deleted]
Misfits,"Loudermilk is funny and down to earth.

Lockwood & Co. was a good watch.

South Park new season premier was very south park"
Misfits,**Let the Right One In** - About a girl who became a vampire and her dad. I didn't expect to like it as much as I did. The cast and atmosphere were pretty solid. Finished S1 after it was canceled by Showtime. I hope someone else will pick it up.
Misfits,Really enjoying **Extraordinary** on D+
Misfits,"*The Night of*

Crime Drama limited series with Riz Ahmed, John Turturro, Michael K. Williams and a bunch of other great performances. I decided to watch it because Steven Zaillian (The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo) and Robert Elswit (great cinematographer) were involved and indeed the quality was high top to bottom. The big takeaways I got from this were two:

-They really went into the details of this world and the processes of the trial, the prison system and in general the judicial system, which isn’t that common and in general I love when there’s a clear feeling that the people behind something know what they are talking about and delve deep into it.

-It’s difficult to explain but something about this series felt different from the standard, run of the mill crime drama. It was probably a combination of the atmosphere, the editing, the performances and most of all the writing of the characters and also in the general sense of the word how the whole investigation was structured and how it unfolded, but yeah very peculiar-feeling show.

If you like the genre then this is unmissable"
Misfits,"One episode left of **The Bear** on Hulu and really enjoying it. I think it's pretty incredible how well this show seems to capture the chaos and stress of working in food service and how that stress multiplies when one is a perfectionist. I was quite surprised, however, just how many F bombs they drop in this show. Not that I care about that, but we're talking Deadwood-tier F-bomb usage."
Misfits,"The Outlaws: Just started it but seems promising.

The Mandalorian: watching it for the third time, getting ready for season 3, Amazing show.

Shrinking"
Misfits,"We are watching **1899** and it's pretty good so far!  I went into it blind, thinking it was a western drama, but I was way off 😆"
Misfits,I finished **The Sandman** and it was fine but it's the main character that steals the show. He is super *dreamy* and rather perfect as Lord Morpheus.
Misfits,"Finished third season of Six feet under, it's really a sad and depressing show but makes you want to value the people in your lives more."
Misfits,Does Banshee have a satisfying ending?
Misfits,"Halfway through **Vox Machina S2**. If you thought the first half of S1 was eh/juvenile and the 2nd half of S1 was just fine, you'll probably like S2. I gave S2E1 a shot and have been actually looking forward to new episodes. 

Biggest issue is just how many characters there are in the core seven, but I was happy that it seems like everyone is getting a focused character episode that fleshes out the less relevant members like Scanlan or Grog. Somehow Pike despite not getting much remains a big standout though... Ashley Johnson is p much outperforming everyone and I'm pretty surprised that she's really the core center of the group. 

It's still very simply a Macguffin hunt with characters developing along the way-- I've been watching their post-episode Q&As on youtube and they fully admit that's what they're going for lol. If you want something unpredictable that you haven't seen before or a deeply nuanced grey story I don't think you'll love this; watch Invincible instead. But there's a lot to enjoy about a classical, heroic journey because of the obvious passion the writers have for their own story so I'm sold on the ride, imo complaining about what it isn't when it's not trying to be the witcher or the boys isn't fair. It's more like an shonen anime than anything else. Speaking of which, this basically [keyleth](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ikGvLUbOuU).

We'll see if it ends well though haha. I think they're very comfortable with Amazon money and are in NO rush at all."
Misfits,"Just finished Utopia. *The British version

Where is Jessica Hyde??

It was batshit crazy and I loved it!"
Misfits,Started Legend of Vox Machina season two and wow it’s been pretty fucking great so far
Misfits,"I just started watching ""Silicon Valley"" last night and finished season 1.  I can't believe I slept on another HBO show.  I like it so far!"
Misfits,Succession on hbo worth watching?
Misfits,"I finished the leftovers. Yesterday I had two episodes left to go in S2. By the end of the day I had completed the series. Could not stop. 

The Book of Nora is one of the best series finales I’ve ever seen. Tears were shed"
Misfits,"I watched a Korean series called **Extraordinary Attorney Woo**, it was very good. The first korean drama with romance that I watched and I enjoyed it a lot. I am not usually a fan of a lot western romance films and shows so this was nice to see. I highly recommend it, the main character is very charming and she has great acting.

Every korean show I have seen has been good except **Money Heist: Korea** which I had to turn off after like 2 or 3 episodes."
Misfits,"I enjoyed **Lockwood and Co.** 

It probably helps that I have listened to the audiobooks several times. The show is pretty faithful to the books; IMO it captures their charm. I hope there will be a second season.

I'm on episode two of the first season of **Carnival Row**, really enjoying it."
Misfits,We are blessed to **The Last Of Us** and **Poker Face** in our lives.
Misfits,"Watching

* Poker Face - this show is intriguing because it's entertaining without being game changing or mind blowing, solely coasting on the absolute treat that is Natasha Lyonne and a whole bunch of incredible acting by weekly characters. I love it. 
* Reservation Dogs - Fuck. Yeah. Love. It. 
* The Last of Us - Pedro Pascal continues to remain handsome and mysterious"
Misfits,I finished the Americans last night and now I don't know what I'm going to do with myself. Absolutely outstanding. I remember hearing it was great but I didn't have access to FX at the time. I'm disappointed that I didn't get to go along for the ride by watching it in real time.
Misfits,Extraordinary. I really loved it and was completely delighted with where it went with its characters and plot. Funny and had just enough heart. I've watched it twice through already.
Misfits,"Slow Horses S01 finished! Great surprise, Gary Oldman is amazing in his role"
Misfits,"You season 4 i'm finding exceptionally awful. I mean, it's never been great TV but it was at least fun. Think it's time to put it out to pasture."
Misfits,"Wanna play Guess the Series?

I’m about halfway through the first season of an acclaimed, slightly older series. Two of the three lead cast members are super tall and probably 2 of the most gorgeous humans I’ve ever laid eyes on and the third has one of the best names ever bestowed to an actor (Scoot McNairy). So far it’s very bingeable."
Misfits,"Just finished Kaleidoscope (on netflix) lastnight.

It was... a bit of a letdown. Simple premise, being about a heist, but it didn't feel like it really built up. Heist movies are typically all about the build-up, but it felt like it was less than the sum of its parts.

Disappointing, because there are a lot of things to like. Generally good acting, I thought, and it seemed like it was on a good track. The last two episodes, though, it's like it just fizzled out. Was much simpler than I expected.

Not sure I'd recommend it to just anybody. There's stuff to enjoy there, but I wouldn't consider it a particularly good ""heist"" sort of story."
Misfits,"Finished **Brassic season 1** .  Watching with family. British comedy series about a bunch of small time criminals living in a small rural town. The best parts are the various idiotic crimes they get involved in - stealing ponies, pretending to kill someones fish, robbing the local strip club etc. But there is a load of relationship drama and whining over whether the main character's friends are going to stick around in the town that really detracts from the show for me. 7/10

Also finished **Babylon Berlin season 3**. Not as good as the story of seasons 1 and 2. In particular I found the main murder storyline with the movie to be a bit boring. But I really enjoyed the more political storyline with the conservatives, the military and the Nazis. I thought Wendt, the conservative/reactionary plotting to use the Nazis to further his  own goals, was done very well as a character. I don't know how to word it exactly but it felt like the show did a good job of using what the audience knows is going to happen in advance - like the conservative elites trying to manipulate the Nazis is going to badly wrong later, Kessler (Horst Wessel) >!is going to be shot!< the whole wall street crash.  8/10 but I might have a break with something else before watching season 4."
Misfits,"I am debating my next binge
Should I watch Mr. Robot or the Americans first? 

I am worried that if I think I know the twist of Mr. Robot it’ll get boring >!that Christian slater isn’t real!< but maybe that isn’t the case. This is on prime and only 4 season I believe

And the Americans has also been on my to be watched list and recently it was added to Hulu and has about 6 seasons 

Which do people recommend watching first?"
Misfits,"Omg, I just discovered Babylon Berlin has a fourth season (only 3 on Nflix Canada). I just found it on another platform. 

Ich bin sehr glücklich! Also, der schvanz ist nicht verboten 🥸"
Misfits,I'm two episodes into *The Travelers* (Netflix). Interesting time-travel plot so far. Gives me some *Continuum* vibes which are not unwelcomed at all. I'm intrigued.
Misfits,"I didn't hate it but with **Carnival Row** - its like they took a lot of disparate elements (western folklore, greek mythology, victorian steam punk, Game of Thrones, detective genre) and threw it into an AI program and let it come up with a story.  

i.e, rather incoherent and silly. I really don't understand the whole point of it but maybe it will become more clear in a 2nd season.

Also: those fairy wings are lame."
Misfits,"I watched the first two episodes of *Poker Face*, been enjoying it so far."
Misfits,"Better Things

Comedy-drama, amazing dialogue and acting, laughs and feels."
Misfits,"should i watch devs, legion, maniac, utopia uk or dark first?"
Misfits,"Watched *You* S4 part 1. It was fine, not great. I enjoy it for what it is though, which is something between trashy netflix shows and actual good TV. 

That said, I wish every single show would stop splitting seasons into 2. For some things it works, but there's just no reason to do it with an objectively mid show"
Misfits,"**The Last of Us** - Had very high expectations and they have definitely been met. Can't wait to finally play the game when it arrives on PC.

**BoJack Horseman** - My third time watching and I cannot describe in words how much I love this show and how much it means to me. It just encapsulates thoughts, feelings and behaviors I've had my entire life that I always though I was alone in feeling, until I watched this show. 

**Peaky Blinders S02E03** - Halfway through season 2 and I don't know if I want to continue. It looks so cool and stylish and I really like Tommy, but the way they chickened out of having any real consequences at the end of season 1 just left a sour taste in my mouth."
Misfits,"From an article suggesting programming like Happy Valley (an all-time favorite song returning for a third season) I started watching two great new series. 

First was The Responder with Martin Freeman about a troubled and possibly bent cop. Very intense. 

Then started watching Inside Man with David Tennant and Stanley Tucci (Netflix). What a find! Intriguing plot. And do I have questions.

To anyone who has seen the first episode. Please explain the payment being made to the politician. I didn’t get the reason behind it."
Misfits,"Just finished the first season of True Detective, really dug it. Especially being a cop show with more macabre elements The only issues I had was with some of the mumbled dialogue, had to rewind a few times."
Misfits,"Acapulco a spanish/english telenova 

It’s so wholesome and fun. Definitely recommend"
Misfits,**Clarkson's Farm S02**  going to binge it this weekend.
Misfits,Just finished The Bear - it was outstanding.  Very quick watch too.
Misfits,"**Justified**

I wasn't sold by the first 6/7 episodes but I kept going because I knew it was a good show, then I started season 2 and all of a sudden I got addicted to this show after the >!Bennet family!< plot. 

I'm currently on season 3 and I'm trying not to binge it too hard because I want to enjoy this one. I love everything about it, can't recommend it enough"
Misfits,Watching Harley Quinn the Animated Series. They make Bane and Detective Gordon these loveable losers it's so funny
Misfits,"Just started American Auto. It is pretty good. Funnier than I expected.
Also watching Poker Face, The Last of Us, and Vox Machina."
Misfits,Not into this season of You at all. Pretty lame.
Misfits,"I tried to quit Doc Martin after S7 but couldn’t—it’s just so ridiculously entertaining—although some of the couple’s situations are over the top, that’s what makes it pure escapism. They’re right to land this plane but not before S8 (I haven’t watched the rest"
Misfits,Any other great BBC crime series? I'm about to finish Giri/Haji and need more stuff to check out!
Misfits,Hey guys im trying to learn german and my way of learning includes burying myself into bunch of german content. Can you suggest any german speaking series ? Series like Dark and babylon berlin will be easier to find ways to watch rather than straight from german channels.
Misfits,rewatching suits and cant believe that show started over a decade ago. first season or two is great.
Misfits,"I got through the last season of the Walking Dead.  Like a lot of people, I used to be more into it 6-7 seasons ago, but I've been keeping the newer ones on in the background as I work.

It's crazy how much they stretched things out in this last season.  Honestly I couldn't tell you what happens in any given episode.  It's all just sort of blur.  Definitely did not need to be 24 episodes.  Especially when the season basically follows the same template other seasons have followed.

The ending is just sort of a wet fart.  Feels more like a season finale than a series one.  But then again with about a dozen spinoffs in the works, I guess it's not really a series one if you get technical.  This season would've been a lot better if they made it about rescuing Rick and his return."
Misfits,"2nd post about rewatching The Wire.. just finished my 4th rewatch (I rewatch every 2yrs or so) and my god it's just so amazing how a show can evoke such a great emotional response, greater than any other show I've seen (and I've watched them all), with PURE and simple storytelling and dialogue. No sappy music, no sappy monologues, in fact outside of characters playing music themselves there is literally NO theme music on the show at all (well except for the sumup at the end of the final episode of each season which is a trademark of david simon shows).

It's just amazing that even after 4 watches this show still manages to evoke such strong emotions (positive and negative) and reactions from me. Other than 2022's *the resort* I can't remember the last time a show made me cry -- and the wire manages to do it sometimes without even using WORDS, sometimes just a simple 2 second image in a scene can be so haunting and powerful... like when >!Duq makes his way to live in the homeless alley after looking back and seeing that Mike had left!<, that tore me up and it was literally just a 2 second glance"
Misfits,"**Cheers** - on the final couple of episodes. Can we please talk about how underrated Keene Curtis was? John Allen Hill has been one of the best recurrent characters on the show, so so so funny."
Misfits,"Last of us is pretty good still

Ginny and Georgia - so cringe. I'd still finish it

Shrinking - good

Extraordinary - Great"
Misfits,"Extraordinary is hilarious and the soundtrack is stellar

They must have a big budget for licensing"
Misfits,"Finished Rubicon, wish it had another season, it was really good.

Currently weekly watching The Last of Us, Ep 5 was fantastic.

Also watching Fauda, The Bureau, and started Counterpart."
Misfits,Can you recommend me tv shows like Extraordinary please?
Misfits,"Russian Doll on Netflix

Decided to check it out because im loving Nat Lyonne’s performance in Poker Face and this show was such a pleasant surprise! Great pacing, great performances, and it was very bingeable. Knocked out season 1 in a day and loved every second of it

Cant exactly speak for season 2 as i havent seen it yet, but the reviews online are pretty good"
Misfits,"**Reservation Dogs** 
Watched both seasons finally after having it on my watch list since it was announced. Enjoyed it even more than I expected. It's easy to connect with the characters, and has many surreal moments of humor that make it feel unique. I grew up in an area of Canada that has lots of reservations nearby, the lingo they use in the show feels very authentic. Lots of heart and the characters deal with grief in a realistic manner better than most shows I've seen. Definitely recommend!

**Reboot**
Sadly it's not more of the classic Canadian CGI cartoon I grew up with, no Bob or Enzo in sight :( But I decided to check it out knowing it's already cancelled and do not regret it. Have yet to finish the 8 episode season, but I already know I will miss this show. All the main actors are people I enjoy watching, the meta jokes, and the writing room arguments have been fun. Johnny Knoxville is someone I'll always root for as an actor. Judy greer really delivers on the comedy. Too bad it never got a chance to grow in a second season and maybe find its audience... Too late for that though."
Misfits,**The Last of Us S01E05** was the best episode of the season by far. Finally an episode worthy of the hype the show gets.
Misfits,I just finished the sopranos for the first time and im beyond blown away. This show has the best story telling and characters of any show i have watched before. What a show!
Misfits,"Just finished the Devils Hour, Ive had this on my list to watch for ages and never got round to starting, wish I'd started it much sooner. The last episode was really on point, 9/10 for me.

[Pieces of Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJwPc0MsbOQ&ab_channel=Netflix) to watch next, another one that looks really good which has slipped under my radar."
Misfits,"Just found out Prime has both seasons of Trial & Error, one of my all time hidden gems that was cancelled far too soon! 

I believe it originally aired in 2017 but has been ridiculously hard to find since it was cancelled so I was so happy to find it all in such an easy place. It’s super easy watching and is so so clever - it’s kinda like Parks & Rec vibes but if it took place in a criminal defense attorney’s office in another rinky dink small town. It’s very satirical and pays homage to a lot of real true crime stories, loosely following The Staircase Peterson case in S1 and The Jinx Durst case in S2 with lots of random true crime Easter eggs sprinkled throughout (including the podcast S-Town!)

Definitely a fun watch for most but if you’re a true crime junkie especially; you’ll feel like you’re in on the joke and get so excited when all the references hit!! So excited to rewatch - it’s the kind of show where there’s so many new jokes to be had in the second pass too"
Misfits,"I need for British modern fun shows like trying, and extraordinary"
Misfits,"Damn I missed last weeks thread. Trying to get one review in every week so I'll just make this a longer one. 

Let's start with **The Last of Us S01E05**. Latest episode was an absolute banger. I knew what was coming from playing the game and it still wrecked me. Ellie's >!traumatized scream after watching Henry pull the trigger!< was acted absolutely fantastic. I agree with people when they say Ramsey's Ellie isn't quite the game Ellie. But to be honest, I'm loving how she's coming at this character. She's fucking killing it IMO. And Joel with his >!hilarious monotone responses when they first meet Henry!< was so gd funny lol. 2nd fav episode so far.

**South Park** Fuck. Yes. No tegridy. Not even a mention of it. Just a brief shot of Tolkien at Credigree and the rest was the boys being boys and their hilarious antics. I hate to say this though, the last few seasons I've noticed the voices of the characters have become...I dno...deeper? Raspier? Trey and Matt are middle aged. I keep thinking they'll notice and adjust for the next season but it seems like its getting worse or at least not getting better. I wonder if down the road they will digitally fix up the voices or just hire new blood to keep the voices relatively consistent? Aging sucks sometimes.

**Severance**. What can I say about this show that hasn't been said? Fantastic music. Phenomenal acting. Tight, unique, poignant and interesting story that doesn't hold the audiences hand. Insanely good cinematography. The colour scheme, the lens selection between Lumon and outside. Is it ok to say Britt Lower is an absolute fox to watch on screen? She goes between trusting newbie learning the ropes and rebellious anarchist like it's nothing. Adam Scott always a pleasure. He's got such a fantastic range. 

**Poker Face** started out strong. The mystery of the week structure was interesting but I'm up to episode 4 now and they've barely continued with the overarching cat and mouse game with Ben Bratt's character and TBH that's what's unhooking my interest right now. Hopefully episode 5 continues that plot? Great casting though. Love the main actress.


See you next week!"
Misfits,"**Reservation Dogs** late but binged through two seasons. Amazing show, every actor nails it. Strong ensemble cast where no point a character feels wasted or one dimensional. Hilarious but handles serious moments great. I really like the episode focusing on the adults. Reminds me of Derry Girls on kids and themes of growing up in tough place. 

**Extraordinary** I never watched a trailer and being on Disney + I assumed it was a teen/family type ya thing. Nope it fits most with Misfits and Being Human. Loving it so far. Some powers for short gags are so good. Like the dentist where people generate a soundtrack for when they’re around and she’s scared of dentists (and it keeps changing).

**Lockwood and co** enjoyed the ya thing but helps it was Joe Cornish. What can be an issue with ya is the exposition on over explaining the rules of the world. I like how this drops key parts but lets the mystery of the world come out naturally and lets you work it out. The kids feel realistically written as kids dealing with responsibilities and being impulsive and screw ups. Vibes different from ya since it still feels grounded and a great soundtrack of 90s goth. 

**Winning Time: the rise of the lakers dynasty**. Stumbled on it by accident. I have zero knowledge on Lakers of basketball. But I like Adam McKay style and the cast. Really good so far, even without knowing the history I can follow."
Misfits,**Extraordinary** started off really funny and somewhere mid season got a little weird but pulled itself together by the end. 8/10. On to **Tokyo Vice**
Misfits,It's official. I've run out of shows to watch. I've seen everything that has been recommended to me (and that actually interests me).
Misfits,"\- I have just finished watching Succession S2. Brilliant acting, jaw-dropping plot twists, shitty but also loveable characters. Such a bonkers show!

>!Would you like to hear my favorite passage from Shakespeare?!<

>!Take !<

>!the fucking money.!<

\- this week's episode of *Poker Face* was brilliant, it was perhaps the best of the lot so far. Nathasha Lyonne is so magnetic. It's just so entertaining watching her unwrap how murders are committed.

\- *The Last of Us*. The silly jokes made me laugh more than they should have."
Misfits,"I see Poker Face is the second most mentioned show but it still needs more people to watch it, nothint short of amazing till now, its not the mystery its the rest of the things that make this show so good.

Also watching the last of us and happy valley (like them both as well)"
Misfits,"The Good 

-	9.6 - The Last Of Us
-	9.3 - Undone
-	9.3 - Slow Horses
-	9.0 - Poker Face
-	7.6 - Tulsa King 

The Bad

-	6.6 - That 90s Show

The Ugly

-	1.5 - Velma"
Misfits,"Finished S1 of Slow Horses and totally loved it. Gary Oldman is phenomenal in his role, and really looking forward to S2.

Rewatching Severance and my god it’s so good. Just finished episode 7 and I think it’s one of the best episodes out there.

Last of Us continues to be an excellent weekly watch."
Misfits,"You should watch **Lockwood & Co**. It's very underrated and it's actually set in a today version of England where it's full of ghosts. It's as if Harry Potter/Sherlock/Doctor Who had a baby with supernatural elements. Great world-building, character dynamics, humor, chemistry between the two characters and a really cool soundtrack. It's currently in danger of getting canceled so you could be saving it. Now is a good opportunity to watch you won't regret it."
Misfits,"**Extraordinary** - an irreverent British comedy with a fresh take on superpowers. I was laughing and smiling throughout. I see a lot of users post ""I was surprised, I usually don't go for that genre."" So if you're on the fence, give it a try, you might just be... surprised!

Also by now I'm sure everyone's using it, but if you aren't, get your backside on r/extraordinary_tv 


YouS4 - doesn't feel like You, but I still like it. Especially as a Brit, hearing Joe's stereotypes about us is funny

Jeremy Clarksons show s2 - pretty good. Jeremy does wind me up sometimes but Kaleb is a delight to watch"
Misfits,"I started Mr. Robot for the first time last night

Up next is gonna be the Americans"
