TV Show,Comment
The Good Detective,Rian Johnson is very hot right now and peacock has got a few surprisingly good shows. Leopard Skin was a trip that should have gotten more attention and Paul T Goldman is one of the best things I’ve seen this year.
The Good Detective,"Episodic Detective Show Revival?

There has never been a lack of episodic detective shows. There are always way too many on TV.."
The Good Detective,"Do they not work with the police?

There hasn't been a decent detective show I can think of for decades where they don't just work with the police.  Monk, Elementary, etc.

Whereas the 80's was all about private eyes and others solving crimes without working with the police."
The Good Detective,Natasha Leonne is the draw.
The Good Detective,They never really went away. The Law & Order revival is surprisingly good if you want that kind of thing. Perhaps a higher profile/budget version of that will emerge but also this show is on Peacock so who knows what kind of impact it will have. Looking forward to watching it though.
The Good Detective,Why not? I think it is nice to have a diversity of storytelling.
The Good Detective,It never went away on broadcast TV. Younger viewers just rejected the format for serialised streaming and cable shows!
The Good Detective,This show is different.  It works because of Rian Johnson.
The Good Detective,They also have Mrs Davis coming up and Damon Lindelof is one of the showrunners
The Good Detective,In terms of actual decent quality
The Good Detective,"without spoiling too much, i'll just say that the answer to this question lies in the setup for the show, and yeah it's closer to the 70's / 80's mystery shows."
The Good Detective,Rian Johnson is the draw.
The Good Detective,Natasha is the draw.
The Good Detective,Who was the draw for Glass Onion?
The Good Detective,I miss Alice. It's a pity they couldn't get her back for this.
The Good Detective,"Season 1 was good, season 2 was mostly passable, but seasons 3 and 4 were corny cliche-ridden rubbish IMHO. Hope it recovers with this movie."
The Good Detective,"kind of unrelated but Idris Elba produces EDM on the side and he actually has some BOPS

I love body shot"
The Good Detective,"The show never recovered after the first 2 seasons, don't know if I want to come back."
The Good Detective,"Hmm, how to leave a useful remark, without any kind of spoiler? Here goes...the writing of The Fallen Sun is as if a mis-matched team of adolescents thought it would be funny to take the post-it's they'd written of every half-remembered superhero pic and lotto-ball-bowl them—it is that coherent - sheesh. The first three decisions Luther makes or are made against him, as so wildly out of character, I had to stop the stream to check that I wasn't watching a parody. The pacing of the story build/development is as if they just raced to check every box 'yes'; yes,  we've covered a, b, c, etc. Illogical, nonsensical, VERY different vibe from 'Luther'. Whiplash inducing. If you like the Luther series - skip this."
The Good Detective,"Saw this in theatres. Absolutely loved it. It was a dark pulsating crime thriller with a great lead and a compelling villain. They don't make movies like this anymore. It wasn't exactly Fincher but the tone reminded me off Girl with the golden with the dragon tattoo.

If you can see it on the big screen, you should. Its miles better than the mediocre Marvel DC movies that are the standard these days"
The Good Detective,Perfectly cromulent.
The Good Detective,Went to shit after season 2
The Good Detective,"Can't wait to see this.

> released on Netflix

Oh, for fuck sake."
The Good Detective,Police are portrayed as useless.
The Good Detective,Stupid! Too many scenes were beyond pathetic and unrealistic. We couldn’t finish it! The writers were horrible.. Come on Idris you are better than this!!
The Good Detective,"The movie was horrible.  so predictable, horrible acting/script.  I'm so disappointed as I was really looking forward to it.  I know it was BBC, but it seems like almost every Netflix movie is a dud lately."
The Good Detective,You might want to finish the last episode of season five…
The Good Detective,Oh... Well at least I know this beforehand now.
The Good Detective,Great Villain and a great actress.
The Good Detective,"No duck face flapping all over the screen?  Couldn't have asked for a better denouement to Luther's story.  This makes me retrospectively like her even more as a character since now I know that the writers didn't wear out her welcome like a bad penny.

I'll refresh my memory on season 1 before I pick up and start season 2 blind."
The Good Detective,Can you just give us a rundown?
The Good Detective,"Can anyone else chime in with their opinions on this? I've never watched Luther but I like Elba. I'm wondering if I watch it, whether there's a point where I'm better off stopping."
The Good Detective,"I really enjoyed season 2, but the death of a certain character in that one really spelled the death of the show imo. It just wasn’t the same afterwards."
The Good Detective,"and he's not bad. Driss the Londoner was his nom de plume in clubs, not sure if he still uses it"
The Good Detective,"First comment I’ve actually agreed with, this film was so jarring it felt like one of those screen plays written by an AI, absolute shit do not watch this film"
The Good Detective,"Tamer, less gritty than Fincher. It was an ok film with some great moments"
The Good Detective,It's in theaters too.
The Good Detective,"There was an interview recently where they heavily hinted at bringing her back in a sequel, so I would say that scene was as ambiguous as it was supposed to be."
The Good Detective,You might want to watch the last episode before you watch this
The Good Detective,Sure thing Charles
The Good Detective,"Do you like police dramas with ever-more-ridiculous criminals? Do you like like individual detectives squaring off against masterminds that somehow entrap and kill entire SWAT teams, yet stop to taunt the detective? If yes, you’re going to fucking LOVE Luther. 

And I don’t mean this ironically. I enjoyed all seasons."
The Good Detective,"It's a police procedural set in a world that's intentionally a bit comic booky.

The character of Luther is not a good man. He has a strict absolute view on what is right and what is wrong. He is right, so anyone in his way is wrong. And anything he does to stop the villains in his life is right. Even if that's someone who isn't actually doing anything wrong.

The bad guys of the week aren't just normal detective show killers, to match Luther's self perception of himself as a hero, they're proper villains, typically quite cartoonish. 

The show presents itself as quite grounded but it doesn't take long before it shows its true colours, and it rubs a lot of people the wrong way if they went in expecting something different. 

It's a show that is more interested in being entertaining that realistic. 

The other aspect is a character that is introduced in the first episode called Alice, who is a fan favourite and an agent of chaos whenever she's on screen. She is not around for the whole show, so a lot of people perceive a drop in quality when she is not in a series.

In general it is a fun show to watch, with a unique approach to the genre, but it is a bit rocky at times. The good thing is that there really aren't many episodes, so it's an easy watch. The longest series was series 1 with 6 episodes."
The Good Detective,"I'm the same person from above, but it's a British show with typically British very short seasons, so it's not a huge time investment. Season 1 is only 6 episodes and that's the longest one. Season 2 is only 4 episodes. It's a steady progression downwards in quality IMHO, so if you find season 2 bad, you should probably stop there. I didn't learn my lesson until later, but unlike a show like Heroes\*, the time investment wasn't so enormous that I felt like I wanted a receipt at the end so I could collect those hours back at the end of my life and use them to watch grass grow or paint dry instead.

*\*Obligatory disclaimer that the writers' strike supposedly ruining Heroes is a viral internet myth. It is misinformation. The show was ruined because the writers were idiots; also note that the strike was between seasons 2 and 3, not between 1 and 2. Spread the word in every Heroes thread.*"
The Good Detective,"Nah just watch it all, season 3 is good, 4 is a step down but then 5 is better and this is apparently goodish"
The Good Detective,It's a [Batman show without Batman](https://www.escapistmagazine.com/luther-is-a-batman-show-without-batman/)
The Good Detective,"A lot of Luther is elevated by Elba’s performance, if you like him you’ll definitely enjoy it. Though earlier seasons are definitely stronger as the later seasons become burdened with trying to keep raising the stakes. Similar to Craig’s bond films, your suspension of disbelief gets called on more as the series progresses"
The Good Detective,"Yeah, good take...perhaps it felt so jarring because Sydney/Bing was hallucinating - heh, also, your comment helped me clarify what I actually felt slogging through the parts I did watch - annoyed. It was NOT Luther."
The Good Detective,"You're right, I never did finish it actually. Might as well start from the beginning before watching the movie. Thanks for the heads up."
The Good Detective,"I suppose it depends on how plausible we're talking. Are they well written villains? Is there a valid reason why they're able to do what they do? Or are we talking ""Sherlock season 3"" here?"
The Good Detective,"Those final two sentences really threw me for a loop, but points for internet comment originality. I am forced to like this comment.

I guess being a big fan of shows like Homicide: Life on the Street kinda disqualifies me from understanding the appeal of a show like this (unless Ruth Wilson is there to chew the scenery, I'll watch her in almost anything)."
The Good Detective,"5 is mostly trash but it’s still watchable because alice is in it. 

Once Luther leaves the force it became a very different show tbh and the whole police doing it by the book vs Luther’s methods is pushed to the background. Will be checking this out to see how they handle it."
The Good Detective,"Ffs just watch a couple episodes and make your own mind up. You say you're an Idris Elba fan, yet you haven't seen arguably his most prominent role?"
The Good Detective,"More Season One (consistently), if Sherlock was a normal detective. In addition, no character (other than Luther himself) has plot armour."
The Good Detective,"Enjoying an actor's work doesn't mean that I immediately run out and watch everything that they've ever been in. Considering the amount of high quality TV that's out there, I also prefer to know whether a show goes in the toilet at some point so I know when to stop watching. Do you also recommend that people watch every single episode of Heroes or The Walking Dead? 

But no, God forbid that we should try to discuss television in a television discussion forum. Why do we even have this review posted here anyway? Everyone should have to watch every single piece of entertainment for themselves to find out whether it's any good or not."
The Good Detective,"There's like 12 episodes of Luther lol if you're curious watch it, if not don't."
The Good Detective,Yes it was. And Suchet was the best Poirot
The Good Detective,I was never big into detectives or Agatha Christie but my mom loved Poirot and I used to sit there and watch this show with her because it was so good and Suchet was such a great Poirot.
The Good Detective,"Suchet is the only actor to ever have the blessing of Agatha Christie’s family and full support of her estate. They gave him unpublished books and unfinished stories to work with along character studies and background research with confirmation that he is everything she intended. To date, he’s the only one who has been welcomed with open arms to the family. According to the descendants of Christie, *he is Poirot*."
The Good Detective,"This is by far and away my favorite detective series. Suchet is a force of nature as Poirot. Honestly, I can't enjoy the new iterations of the character because of him. I mean, they did every single short story and novel, for better or worse."
The Good Detective,My mom introduced me to this show years ago and I now have a BritBox subscription solely for it. It’s just so good.
The Good Detective,"David Suchet shows us how he does Poirot's voice

https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=MZJpGq6W1bw"
The Good Detective,"Myself and the mrs constantly throw out his variously butchered idioms, his one about the ‘sleepy dogs’ especially."
The Good Detective,Ah Hastings
The Good Detective,"This is 100% my comfort rewatch show, it’s seemingly on a constant loop for me. Worth every penny of my britbox subscription."
The Good Detective,He is the reason why I cannot watch the new one. Its a parody in comparison to this man.
The Good Detective,This style of detective show is a true interactive experience as you try to work it out before Hercule.
The Good Detective,It's a really fun show to spot famous actors in smaller parts.
The Good Detective,Anyone going to mention Joan Hickson as Miss Marple? I can’t think of anyone who was more fit for that role. Her and David Suchet even met for the Agatha Christie centenary special.
The Good Detective,Suchet on a broadbean!
The Good Detective,I can’t bear to watch my of the Kenneth Branagh ones. It should be a crime to cast anyone else as Poirot while David Suchet is still working.
The Good Detective,"It set up the clues honestly, was careful and immersive, confident and charming, subtle, had one of the most faithfully written and portrayed versions of Poirot ever... Pretty much had everything going for it. No wonder it lasted as long as it did."
The Good Detective,It is truly remarkable to see an actor that dedicated such an enormous portion of their life and career to play a singular character. David Suchet is an example other actors should follow.
The Good Detective,"Imma let you finish, but allow me to offer Granada's Sherlock Holmes with Jeremy Brett for your consideration."
The Good Detective,"I began reading Christie as a child because my mother loved her so much, and we watched this show (and still do) along with Miss Marple.  It will always have a special place in my heart."
The Good Detective,"One of my favorite shows. Rarity in pacing, direction and acting."
The Good Detective,"I love this show. It was my first mystery series, I watched with my parents all the time. Still have some of the DVDs."
The Good Detective,"If you love this series and enjoy audiobooks, I highly recommend Murder on the Orient Express narrated by Dan Stevens. I knew Stevens was a good actor, but his version of Poirot is superb, sounds just like Suchet."
The Good Detective,The Art Deco scenography is so beautiful
The Good Detective,It also had a great Art Deco graphics intro and wonderful theme song.
The Good Detective,I'm looking to get into the Poirot show. What are the top 5 episodes I should watch first?
The Good Detective,"I have read the whole Poirot series, and agree that D. Suchet acting was on the spot, also, he matched the description well (egg-shaped head is mentioned way too often, though).  


Nevertheless, the quality of the series is inferior to Sherlock Holmes, unfortunately. The introduction of Poirot's brother is made with self-irony by the author, yet still looks like a cheap out of nowhere move."
The Good Detective,"Loved the show until they got rid of the side kick (Captain 'I say!' Hastings) and Miss Lemon. 

From there it went downhill and we quit watching."
The Good Detective,Columbo has entered the chat
The Good Detective,Because Suchet was perfect Poirot. It is that easy.
The Good Detective,I watched somewhere how he got into the character of poirot and apparently he has a special coin he used to help him get the right posture and uptight look he has. That and the moustache.
The Good Detective,I’m Benoit Blanc pilled and I do believe Benoit owes his existence (in part) to Poirot. I pay homage
The Good Detective,"He's the definitive Poirot. Like they should not try doing it with someone else for a long time

Jeremy Brett, to a lesser extent, is the classic Sherlock Holmes for me. Somehow, Sherlock Holmes as a character is more open to different takes / interpretations / incarnations, whereas there's just one Poirot"
The Good Detective,Harry and the Hendersons was here.
The Good Detective,I know what I am watching tonight
The Good Detective,"While Suchet was awesome, I will never get these ""whoevers family"" as the people judging how close anything is to what the author was aiming for. They're mostly just after them moneys, not authentic/close to books presentation."
The Good Detective,Where can one watch this?
The Good Detective,[deleted]
The Good Detective,SPOILER ALERT!!!
The Good Detective,"Suchet was fantastic and I can’t imagine another Poirot. However, the show is way too formulaic and a bit derivative for my taste.

Sherlock Holmes with Jeremy Brett. That’s the good stuff."
The Good Detective,"those were some great times when this show aired. trying to figure it all out before the end of the show. 

i wonder why we do not get a new kind of hercule poirot tv serie or miss marple show. but finding the right people for that is maybe just as hard in finding the new james bond."
The Good Detective,“Madame is mending the car!”
The Good Detective,"Absolutely loved it.

Finally watched Curtain a couple of years ago long after it aired.

I was ugly crying lol"
The Good Detective,Colombo was better! Downvote if you agree!
The Good Detective,Rian Johnson should adapt this instead of doing a derivative with more knives out stuff
The Good Detective,"I totally agree. Ustinov and Finneys takes were not bad, but different. The Branagh Orient Express felt like a modern take, kind of what Daniel Craig was for Bond (but not as good). 

Edit: Yes the Branagh-mustache was ridiculous, just as the complete Death on the Nile, but his Orient was quite ok imho. 

By the way : if someone happens to be in western germany, there is a small town called Hillesheim in the rural ""Eifel""-Area. You can easily enjoy nature there, but there is a [Hotel with crime themed rooms](https://www.krimihotel.de/) and solid german food (the food is good but nothing special). They also have crime-dinners and escape rooms.  [Here](https://www.instagram.com/p/CmFAf0FoaU5/) are some of my private pictures.

Also there is a [murder mystery themed cafe](http://www.kriminalhaus.de/cafe.htm) with nooks and tables decorated for various series of murder mysteries and a book store. [Here](https://www.instagram.com/p/BztBDHandFi/) are private pictures again."

Graceful Friends,"Great write up!


I'm not familiar with most of these, and I watch a shit-ton of TV and movies. I really like the effort, and the writeups are perfect in length.


Again, not knowing these a lot, is Severance the highest ranked English speaking show? (Nothing against non English speakers of course) 


Also, I'm guessing most of these are straight drama? Language and genre might both be useful things to put in parenthesis for anyone else unfamiliar.


Totally agree with the couple from White Lotus being great characters, I much preferred season 1 (which seems like a hot take) but those two, specifically the woman, were very interesting characters to me."
Graceful Friends,"How you pick what to watch? I’m overwhelmed with all these shows in Netflix and I always seem to pick the limited series or those talked about in reddit, especially regarding to the foreign shows or K dramas. There isn’t much write-ups or reviews in English."
Graceful Friends,I am glad and surprised Prisma is number one. Well deserved
Graceful Friends,"This is Going to Hurt: I'm a medical student and I thought I'd seen every medical show but this one is on my list now! I've heard that this show shows the reality of a doctor's life without all the glamor of medicine.

..................

I didn't like what 2022 television had to offer for the most part. One too many disappointments for me as well. I mean I watched a lot more shows than I did in 2021, yet struggled to find 25 new shows for this list. But I do think my top 13 here are genuinely great.But anyways, thanks a lot for reading, even if you just scrolled through this lol. Same time, same place, next year? ❤️"
Graceful Friends,"Neat list.  A lot of shows I've not seen.

A few shows from 2022 I'd recommend if you haven't seen em:

- Black Bird

- SAS Rogue Heroes

- The Offer

- Under the Banner of Heaven"
Graceful Friends,Recency bias but I just finished Yellowjackets and really had a great time watching it.
Graceful Friends,No Atlanta? Both seasons last year were incredible
Graceful Friends,Pachinko is the most slept on series of 2022
Graceful Friends,"1. She hulk
2. Ted lasso
3. Ms Marvel
4. Harley Quinn show
5. Lord of the rings
6. Spy x family 
7. Chainsaw man
8. Loki
9. Mob psycho
10. Hot D"
Graceful Friends,Which ones did you see? 🤔 amma take a wild guess and say The Bear and Severance?
Graceful Friends,"> is Severance the highest ranked English speaking show?

Yes. Even though Pachinko got a bit of english too. 

> I'm guessing most of these are straight drama? Language and genre might both be useful things to put in parenthesis for anyone else unfamiliar.

Yea. And yea I should probably do that next time."
Graceful Friends,"i just read the synopsis and glance at the preview a bit sometimes just to check visual/production quality. if it looks like something that could be potentially great, i check it out."
Graceful Friends,🙂💕
Graceful Friends,It’s great but it’s depressing.
Graceful Friends,"What other new anime from 2022 did you think were great? 

Anime for me in 2022 was, *meh* tbh. I didn't like Summertime Rendering much and Chainsaw Man hasn't gotten to the good parts of the manga yet. I was suppose to see Bocchi The Rock! before making this list, but ended up getting an ear infection so couldn't."
Graceful Friends,I'd count Yellowjackets as 2021 TV show.
Graceful Friends,on the other version of this list pinned on my profile.
Graceful Friends,"Nice! Do you often give the pilot a go before fully committed to the whole season? Any shows that you have given up midpoint? 


Like I tried to start Warrior Nun because the trailer seems fun and the lead actress looks very beautiful, also being afraid of it being cancelled (it indeed got cancelled then), but have given up after episode 6 or 7… cause the plot is very weak and the characters are laughable.


And then I tried to pick the ones that got high ratings in imdb, and started watching Extraordinary Attorney Woo and I do like it so far! Although sometimes being too cheesy at times, the acting is excellent and the stories are well-written. Highly recommended."
Graceful Friends,"Dropped Summertime after 5 minutes lol.

But personally, Bocchi the Rock is incredible TV and is my #1 show of any medium this year. And I'm not even usually into anime comedies. It's just that good, glad you're gonna try it! I'm an Attack on Titan fan after the massive story shift in Season 3, and S4P2 aired at the start of the year, although personally I don't like rating something that isn't an entire season.

Otherwise Chainsaw Man would be a decent pick even if, as you said, it hasn't quite gotten to what makes it special yet. Cyberpunk Edgerunners is one that would be worth watching and has near universal praise, and my other 2 shows to hit a 9 were Kaguya S3 (but it's not everyone), and Paripi Koumei, which I thought was an extremely passionate show but it might hit as a 7-8 for others. 

From your list I probably have to watch the 2 seasons of Tatami though. I had no idea it was well regarded I never looked into it!

Other than that though, yea there was a lot of meh. Spy Family went from potentially great to just average as it went on, LycoRyco got a lot of hype but was merely good not great (needed some writing cleanup). Personally though Dress up Darling was ok at best, and Gundam and To Your Eternity were massive disappointments"
Graceful Friends,Ignoring some great sequels I thought Chainsaw man was awesome even if it hadn't gotten to some of the good parts  of the manga. And I really liked summertime rendering (although I haven't seen the last few episodes). Lycoris recoil was fun. Spy X Family was great.
Graceful Friends,Oh my bad. I’m late to the party.
Graceful Friends,"> Do you often give the pilot a go before fully committed to the whole season?

I give everything at least 4 episodes before I decided whether it's working for me or not. Unless it's *reeeeeeeaaaaally* bad... then I quit after the 2nd or 3rd. But that rarely happens. That has only happened like 4 times in the past 3 years. 

> Any shows that you have given up midpoint?

A shit ton. 

> Extraordinary Attorney

I was suppose to watch this show too but unfortunately didn't have time for it. There are some great shows coming out of korea nowadays (3 are on this list too lol), but they require commitment with those lengthy episode counts and runtime. 

I recommend ""**D.P.**"" on netflix too if you haven't seen it. That's another outstanding one."
Graceful Friends,"> Bocchi the Rock is incredible TV and is my #1 show of any medium this year. And I'm not even usually into anime comedies. It's just that good

damn. guess i gotta hurry and check this one out now. lol."
Graceful Friends,"You should check out Kotaro Lives Alone, such a good show!"
Graceful Friends,"Heard good reviews about DP but I haven’t managed to watch it, with season 2 coming this year I may watch it soon!

For other Korean shows I watched My Name, Hellbound and of course Squid Game in 2021, which were all very good. Narco-Saints, The Glory and Somebody are shows I saved in 2022 but not started yet."
Graceful Friends,I did hear about it! I'll add it to my list thanks!
Graceful Friends,"I personally disagree on Season 3 being the best for Scrubs, Buffy, and Arrested Development (though I generally understand the argument for Scrubs and Buffy).

I seem to usually prefer Season 2s to more shows than Season 3s.

That said, I might add the following shows to the list of ""Season 3 was their best"":

A Series of Unfortunate Events

Castlevania (though I suspect I'm in the minority on this one)

Runaways

Star Wars Rebels

The Legend of Korra

Weird that most of these are animated since I don't watch that many animated shows."
Graceful Friends,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation.""  That's the season with my absolute favorite episode (""Yesterday's Enterprise"") and ended on the ""Best of Both Worlds, Part 1"" cliffhanger."
Graceful Friends,Succession - hopefully season 4 is even better
Graceful Friends,"Narcos, game of thrones ( close with 2 and 4. But I thought 3 was the best the first time)."
Graceful Friends,Farscape maybe? Haven't watched the show since it aired though.
Graceful Friends,"I wouldn’t say most of that list is definitive. 
My picks for best season of each:

Buffy - 5

Angel - 5

Parks and rec - 3

The x-files - 3

The sopranos - 5

Friends - 5

Cheers - 2

The Simpsons - 4

Arrested development - 1

Fresh Prince - haven’t seen

Will & grace - haven’t seen

Scrubs - haven’t seen

Malcolm in the middle - haven’t seen

Futurama - 3

House - 4

MASH - Final season"
Graceful Friends,1899
Graceful Friends,"Season 1 is establishing the concept of a show that gets people hooked. Season 2 is the ""difficult second album"" where shows panic to get more out and sometimes miss the mark, Season 3 is where they've figured out what works and what doesn't and are jn the flow, then after that a lot of the best ideas have been used up.

Doesn't always work like this of course.
Season 2 and 3 of community were pretty great, Season 2 was better rated but I preferred 3."
Graceful Friends,I agree with this. Often are season 3 the best and season 5 where the downfall starts. To add to your list; Entourage.
The Barrier,[This video of him describing how he wrote one of the iconic songs from the Twin Peaks soundtrack is a classic.](https://youtu.be/e-eqgr_gn4k) Even if you have no interest in Twin Peaks it's worth a watch.
The Barrier,"No wonder David said [""Today, no music""](https://youtu.be/J2FiFAuQOK8?t=22) during his weather update. I figured something was up, this just sucks. Thank you Angelo."
The Barrier,The Lynch/Badalamenti collaboration is one of the most beautiful and influential yet inimitable partnerships in the history of cinema. What a loss!
The Barrier,"This one fucking hurts, man."
The Barrier,Oh Angelo :(
The Barrier,Actually bought the soundtrack back when the show was on because I loved the music so much. RIP
The Barrier,"> ""All that we see in this world is based on someone's ideas. Some ideas are destructive, some are constructive. Some ideas can arrive in the form of a dream. I can say it again: some ideas arrive in the form of a dream."" - Log Lady

Thanks for translating your dreams and ideas into reality, Mr. Badalamenti."
The Barrier,His work on Lost Highway was amazing.
The Barrier,"An absolutely phenomenal composer. His music is really one of the most defining aspects of Twin Peaks and the rest of his discography is wonderful too.

Rest in peace."
The Barrier,"An absolute genius.

If you want to feel sad but uplifted, here's [The Danish National Orchestra](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtGL2Tqfdws) playing a medley of ""Laura's Theme"" and ""Falling"". It's gorgeous."
The Barrier,Ominous whooshing intensifies.
The Barrier,He was also the composer for National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation
The Barrier,Twin Peaks theme is one of my favorite pieces of music. Rest in peace.
The Barrier,"This one really got to me, his work with David Lynch is utterly amazing. His Fire Walk With Me theme is his magnum opus in my eyes.
I'll cherish his work for as long as I live."
The Barrier,"Oh man, he was an icon. Twin Peaks theme will forever be my favorite score for a movie."
The Barrier,"First Julee Cruise, now Angelo... Great loss. His music has been with me since childhood, through good and bad moments. Sad day."
The Barrier,"Sad to hear, RIP to a legend"
The Barrier,"RIP. Legend. 

What a master of mood and tone. From this https://youtu.be/VA6bVJ1vw_A (the Pink Room from Fire Walk with Me) to https://youtu.be/xk8Y-XxaAog (Lauren’s Walking from Straight Story). Two great movies if you haven’t seen them already."
The Barrier,"There are very few people who really inspire me with their music, but this guy's constant collaborations with David Lynch always, always blew me away."
The Barrier,Nooooooooooooo
The Barrier,This is awful.
The Barrier,"I love this video, so cool to see how two creative minds interact with each other to produce something beautiful."
The Barrier,I watch this every time I see it posted somewhere. It's truly magical
The Barrier,I knew something was up this morning. He wasn't his usual self
The Barrier,"Jesus, I don’t think I’ve ever heard him sound like this before."
The Barrier,The Twin Peaks soundtracks are my go-to nighttime driving music.  RIP Angelo
The Barrier,I have the Twin Peaks soundtrack on cassette from back then as well as a VHS release of his music but I can’t remember what it was called.
The Barrier,"Agreed. I like most of his work across the board, but the Lost Highway Soundtrack came out when I was 15 or so, and it still resonates with me deeply."
The Barrier,Nightmare on Elm Street 3
The Barrier,"The VHS was probably ""Industrial Symphony No. 1"""
The Barrier,If you pitched this write up to Netflix they would green light a season of it and hire you to write it. That’s the problem right there.
The Barrier,"A lot sausage making happens between when when a season outline is made and final episodes are available for viewing.  

Television shows are commercial products.  Showrunners and writers almost never have full creative control.  Particularly for streaming services, metrics often matter more than any subjective view of quality."
The Barrier,">why write for a Riverdale when you could write for Succession?

You could ask this about any type of job. I am a software developer, why don't I work for Google or Amazon?  I don't want to. I like where I am at now, and some writers of Riverdale may genuinely enjoy creating the absurdity that is that show. They've also had job stability working on a show that has lasted so many seasons.

But honestly, I also probably would not pass the interview process at either Google or Amazon if I tried. And most of the people who write for the CW might be competent enough to write teen dramas, but aren't going to get hired by someone seeking critical acclaim."
The Barrier,"The writers on CW are notoriously bad at their jobs, which sadly has been going on since early 2000s. If you want proof, look up the leaked script of Powerpuff Girls pilot episode"
The Barrier,"Arrow. The olicity pretty much brought down the show. That and they needed less episodes in a season.
 
But again this is CW the thread."
The Barrier,"Not only why write for Riverdale, but why be a staff writer at all unless you can't create your own show?   So writing staffs are filled with people either ""paying their dues"" or dead enders who can't do much else.  While show creators tend to create multiple shows, often using a formula if they are really cranking out shows in high volume like Dick Wolf or Greg Berlanti."
The Barrier,Yet people are still blaming GoT showrunners on reddit? Strange.
The Barrier,"They aren't bad at their jobs they just have to write and insane amount of episodes in a few weeks. That is the job they have though because CW makes content, not necessarily good content."
The Barrier,Weird thing is the Powerpuff Girls script was written by an Academy Award winner.
The Barrier,"How fucking dare you. CW was founded in 2006, hardly early 2000s"
The Barrier,Shame that it's audience will be limited cause it's on a subscale platform
The Barrier,"Trailer looked very generic. But oh well, Ted Lasso looked terrible through trailers as well. And Mike Schur shows get better by season 2 always."
The Barrier,Mike Schur is the 🐏 of modern day comedy
The Barrier,"Damnit was just considering signing up to Peacock for a month to rewatch Battlestar, now I gotta wait until this is over to watch this as well.

Wait!  No I don’t!  Stream All Episodes April 22!  Peacock does binge releases?  I’m suddenly much more interested Peacock."
The Barrier,"I like Mike Schur, but I don't like Ed Helms. I guess I'll give it a chance though."
The Barrier,Does anyone know if this will be streaming anywhere in Canada?
The Barrier,Any news on when we can watch this in UK?
The Barrier,Alright. I was going to watch it just because it was by Mike Schur (so far anything he seems to be involved with is great).
The Barrier,Peacock isn't badly priced. It's 4.99 monthly and sometimes I've seen it 4 months for $10. It's like one Starbucks coffee and if you use a VPN it'll block the ads too
The Barrier,Too bad it's on Peacock.
The Barrier,Its going to have a good international numbers though. Mike Schur shows are instant sells on Netflix and Prime globally
The Barrier,The Good Place was fantastic right out the gate.
The Barrier,That's a ram not 🐐 (unless you meant ram?) but I get your point 😂
The Barrier,"It depends on the series I think, but so far at least Saved by the Bell and Punky Brewster both dropped all episodes at once."
The Barrier,"That's cool, I much prefer binge releases. Signing up for one month to just watch this show then cancelling might discourage them doing more binge releases though, but they don't really have anything else I want to watch enough to subscribe for more than a month. I guess I could check out A.P. Bio since I like Glenn Howerton on Always Sunny."
The Barrier,*[Egg Helms](https://youtu.be/0KEIPWzDBpw)
The Barrier,On showcase & global I think!
The Barrier,I was just going to watch it because of Ed Helms but now that I know Schur is the creator I’m in x2
The Barrier,"While they’re on Netflix. This is a peacock original, I doubt Netflix will get it"
The Barrier,"As was Nine-Nine, but Parks and Rec, as well as The Office, didn't have the best starts."
The Barrier,"Hahaha wrong emoji, thanks"
The Barrier,"I don't find Aunty Donna funny either, so this did nothing for me."
The Barrier,"Peacock is not available internationally and is therefore sold to other streaming services.

Modern say syndication"
The Barrier,"Internationally, unless peacock launches, they will definitely have deals with other streamers. Every other streamer does this."
The Barrier,"I know it's a fine line, but the US Office was showrun by Greg Daniels, not Mike Schur, even though he was a writer on it."
The Barrier,But Mark Brendanawicz was wonderful..
The Barrier,Really Awesome Maker of comedies... I agree!
The Barrier,TIL. So USA Netflix won’t get it unless peacock flops like quibi did
The Barrier,You're beautiful
The Barrier,Almost certainly
The Barrier,Apparently the budget of the whole season is around $11 millions US. Which is around the cost of ***one (1)*** episode of the upcoming Netflix show.
The Barrier,30 episodes? jesus
The Barrier,We are all turkeys. So are you.
The Barrier,"I knew nothing of this going in, and haven't watched anything Chinese before. Episode 2 was mind-blowing in the best of ways."
The Barrier,"It is also worth noting this is available on Rakuten Viki in a lot of markets as well as YouTube. 

I’ve not had the chance to check it out yet but I absolutely will. Glad to hear it is a very solid adaptation and that they have plans to do the sequel books as well."
The Barrier,"Thanks for this, I was unaware I could watch it yet.  I saw your link as well.  I am pumped to watch this.

I have read through the boxset enough times that I actually just reordered it.  My friends think I am nuts for multiple reads for some reason."
The Barrier,"so much better than the CGI version, ""The Three Body Problem"" so confusing with three different TV shows and apparently a movie out there somewhere. I watched one episode of that and didn't continue, only started the first episode of this live action one, but wow that other one is bad."
The Barrier,"Honestly surprised at how much of the VR stuff they're doing and the production value of the CGI.  It's not amazing by any means, but it looks surprisingly good at times.  I believe in the Netflix version they'll be doing all those scenes with actors on a green screen.

I'm enjoying it quite a bit. It's so slow with the 30 episode run, and the cinematography and areas they film are so beautiful at times. It's nice to just turn on and chill and watch.  

Loved the books after reading them just over the past few months and I have serious concerns with the Netflix version as this does not seem like a book series you can really turn into a short, bingeable streaming show.  But they are going hard into the books on this version, for better or worse, and I don't imagine anyone else would do such a faithful translation to the screen."
The Barrier,"\>they recently announced they will also do the other books in the series. 

Hurray! I just finished the show, was hugely impressed. Hadn't seen any Chinese TV shows before.

30 episodes meant they got to take their time and include (almost?) everything from the book. Has been a few years since I read it."
The Barrier,"Going to have to check this out!  I just finished the last book in the trilogy a few days ago, and found them to be quite enjoyable.  Had no idea they were being adapted into a series, though (until now).  Thanks!"
The Barrier,"Definitely looking forward to binging it

I never read the books so it will be interesting to see the story for the first time"
The Barrier,"How did you watch it, it doesn’t appear to be out yet"
The Barrier,I'll have to give it a try
The Barrier,"It's great isn't it I'm! 18 eps in, loving how fleshed out and not rushed it seems. The story telling has been fantastic throughout but especially ep 14(I think) onwards."
The Barrier,"Not a fan of the book, it's extremely pessimistic. The ""solution"" to the problem in the first book is kind of comical. It's made out to be some incredibly difficult problem that an interstellar civilization couldn't figure out, but then, it's just answered pretty plainly.

Also the author is a horrible person."
The Barrier,"It's shot like a parody. You have to be paid to hype that trash so much, especially to suggest it will influence a generation."
The Barrier,"I got as far as ep 4 then gave up, it was progressing so slowly - an entire episode given over to our guy wondering  about the numbers appearing in his photos - I was dying of boredom. Maybe I'll give it another go and carry on at some point, IDK. 
Loved the books."
The Barrier,"Wow that's a pretty incredible difference, can't wait to see what take Netflix and co. will have on this"
The Barrier,"the real difference is that everything is expensive in Hollywood because of unions, production crews, filming location, taxes and etc...

so with 11 million dollars they are able to do something Hollywood would need like 50 million"
The Barrier,"There are some extremely long series (30-50 episodes) in both China and Korea for one season, sometimes with 70-90 minute episode run time in Korean TV where they can't show commercials so the episodes incorporate a lot of product placement versus 44 minutes in American broadcast TV with about 15 minutes for commercial breaks.
The upside is one knows in advance that the series will usually end with one season."
The Barrier,Yeah I'll admit that's a big draw to me; I love when writers have lots of runtime to work with. It (in the right hands) does the subject matter better justice and they seem to really have splurged on this.
The Barrier,The movie was terrible/not representative of the book  as could be expected for such a short runtime. The effects were ok but I’m not really there for that
The Barrier,"While Netflix might not be the best bet for the most faithful adaptation they're probably more likely to actually finish the story. Although they've said it's renewed waiting for 2nd seasons of Chinese shows is a nightmare, it could be 1 year, 5 years or even never. It's supposedly really popular over there so hopefully it falls more on the quicker end of the scale but they don't have a good track record."
The Barrier,"Agreed on all points. The CGI (>!mostly the virtual world scenes!<) is probably the worst part of the show for me. It is kindof surprisingly bad? Not bad, just not up to par with the rest of the show and certainly not excellent"
The Barrier,"A yes! Forgot the essential bit.

Here is the link to the playlist: [https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLMX26aiIvX5rFSYPXtcqda3tWd6pGVD5Q](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLMX26aiIvX5rFSYPXtcqda3tWd6pGVD5Q)

&#x200B;

Added tip: I found setting the subtitles to 150% works best"
The Barrier,Why is he a horrible person?
The Barrier,"I’m curious, have you watched full episodes to form this opinion?"
The Barrier,"i probably should've expanded but i'm surprised. it's hopefully a good thing because from what i've heard about the three body problem is that it would be hard to adapt to film but i don't know if that's a runtime issue or a ""this show gets weird and would be hard to translate"" but either way it's good the writers were given enough room to move. so long as it isn't bloat"
The Barrier,"It's weird because some stuff, like when there is a lot of smoke, it looks like a PS2 game.  But other times, when the CGI characters are talking, you can ""see"" the actors face in their CGI character. It's so weird.  I don't imagine they did mocap on the faces like Avatar lol

EDIT: It's also so weird to see >!the Trisolarians dehydrate. I always thought they'd just dry out into like a strawman. And later on didn't even picture them as human beings.  But in the show they lay down and just start flipping out with water squirting everywhere!<"
The Barrier,A point here is that the show is set in 2007. So it is representing things from 16 years ago. It's kinda funny that parts of it are practically a VW commercial. All the main characters drive those older VWs. Or maybe I just notice more because the main character drives the same Gen1 Tiguan I drove up until about three weeks ago.
The Duchess,"I wish Netflix was more picky with their shows, quality aside, seems like a waste of money shooting on all directions and just cancelling shows so soon."
The Duchess,People complain about netflix not picking up shows again but thats the reality of most shows on most tv stations.
The Duchess,Never heard about this show until now.
The Duchess,"Katherine Ryan has a very specific comedic style that not everyone gets. It is very over the top in your face and outlandish while also making fun of everyone which probably didn't translate well for most audiences. I loved the show however and found the undertones about motherhood and the bullshit of it all really spoke to me. The daughter hair cutting scene really got to me. 

You can be a shitty protagonist who makes shitty choices and still resonate with the audience on some level."
The Duchess,Oh dang. I enjoyed this show. I like her brand of comedy
The Duchess,"It was ok, I am not sad though. I think Katherine Ryan is one hell of a comedian she is also very open about doing as much as she can to sustain her life, so I think for her it is just a question of waiting for other projects to come."
The Duchess,">The six-part series launched in September 2020 but will not return. It is centered around the powerful and problematic choices of a fashionably disruptive single mom living in London. Her daughter, Olive, is her greatest love so she debates a second child with her greatest enemy — Olive’s dad.

Wow, that sounds fantastically dull."
The Duchess,I can’t say I’m surprised. I absolutely love Katherine Ryan but this show wasn’t very good.
The Duchess,Fuck why would they do that to me
The Duchess,This show was awful.
The Duchess,"That's a shame, i really liked it and would have liked to see more of the characters"
The Duchess,Why is it called The Duchess again? I watched this show when I was bored but I always found the title confusing. I don't even remember if the show mentioned why.
The Duchess,You could tell just from the trailer that this show was utter shit and heading for a quick cancellation. It is no surprise that the folks in charge of the TV programming divisions were sacked shortly before Netflix’s latest batch of comedy shows arrived on air. It has not been a good Q1 for Netflix overall but the comedy offerings in particular have really bombed and made little impact with viewers.
The Duchess,it is not bingeable for me
The Duchess,[deleted]
The Duchess,Unfortunately last I saw she hardly has a face anymore. Can't see how you can act well when at best you've only for your eyebrows to emote with.
The Duchess,"I would vote this the worst show I have seen in a long while- the Australian boyfriend? Oh. My. God. Did a more uncharismatic wooden character ever arrive on a screen, no-one was likeable! I only lasted 3 episodes…in the bin it goes!"
The Duchess,Yeah! Like why does Shadow and Bone have ads everywhere months and weeks up til it’s release but there’s like 20 other shows debuting at the same time that will never stand a chance?
The Duchess,">	doing as much as she can to sustain her life.

What do you mean by sustain her life?"
The Duchess,Premise is bland but the show was pretty good.
The Duchess,Her second daughter is called Duchess.
The Duchess,"95% of the Netflix shows are shit...

I watched this, it wasnt bad, it was like 6 episodes of 30 minutes.  The comedian was on another sketch type show on netflix so I can see how this show came about.  They obviously did zero promotion for this and it got lost in the madness that is their platform.

And some of the most popular shows are also utter shit, like Bridgeton or reality based shows like The Circle."
The Duchess,Exceptions can apparently be made.
The Duchess,Shadow and Bone probably cost 20x more
The Duchess,"They are trying to find their next Stranger Things.  The netflix model has always been about one or two big shows to keep people coming back.  It was Orange Is The New Black in the early days, then Stranger Things blew up.  These 'big' shows drive new subscribers in ways that small comedies like The Duchess never will.

The Witcher was supposed to be the next big break out hit, and it seemed to do well, but not the global phenomenon that Stranger Things is.  So now they're hoping Shadow and Bone might be the one, so they'll throw money at that.  It's not being talked about that much, so they'll probably move on to the next hopeful as soon as they figure out what that is.  Or maybe they'll pump their advertising budget into Witcher season 2 and try and force it into greatness."
The Duchess,"you know, work to have money to spent. Maybe i should have said ""fund her lifestyle""."
The Duchess,"That’s setting the kid up for playground taunting, for sure."
The Duchess,Just because you were one of half a dozen people who made it to the end of this TV show does not mean it was not utter shit and a massive flop. Trying to compare this to a highly successful show like Bridgerton is just embarrassing...
The Duchess,"Oh my apologies, it makes sense to me now when you say fund her lifestyle."
The Duchess,"I have no opinion on this show whatsoever, but who's made you the arbiter of deciding what is and isn't shit? I find it ironic for you to call the previous poster out for making a definitive statement while doing the very same thing, just with a different opinion. Even funnier because judging from your first post, you haven't actually watched the show unlike them."
The Duchess,"Well, just because you didn't like it doesn't mean it's shit."
The Duchess,"no problem, I just did not remembered the words to use at the time."
The Duchess,"I watched the trailer and then gave the show 10 minutes. It was utter shit, as expected from the trailer, so that was enough for me. The show being shit is a personal opinion. The dude had the completely opposite opinion. The show bombing and being a massive flop is backed by the little data we have showing it made zero impact in Netflix’s internal Top 10 lists and by the fact that the show was cancelled due to not being viable or worthwhile for Netflix to bother investing in a second season. 

I’ve not watched Bridgerton myself so have no personal opinion on the subjective “quality” of the show itself but given the reported record viewing figures for the platform and the fact that it got a quick second and third season renewal one would have to have their head planted firmly up their own arse to miss the fact that the show has been a big hit for Netflix."
The Duchess,All good mate :)
The Duchess,"That's all fair. Don't think they missed the fact that Bridgerton has been huge, though. They did say some of their most popular shows! Just didn't like it despite that fact."
The Duchess,"Oh he gave the show 10 whole minutes LMAO
That's his attention span!"
The Duchess,I think this may have been filmed in Manchester. I remember bumping into a film crew at one of the brewerys in Manchester and they said it was a netflix project with Katherine Ryan that they were working on
The Duchess,"I enjoy Katherine Ryan. 

I will give this a try when it comes out."
The Duchess,"Never cared for her on TV panel shows much, but saw her live at the Edinburgh Fringe a few years back as part of a late-night show and she was fantastic - absolutely brought the house down."
The Duchess,I really like Katherine Ryan so will definitely be checking this out.
The Duchess,"

> Katherine Ryan, fresh off her Netflix special “In Trouble,” came to us with an idea based on her life as a fabulous single mom living in London. Season 1 follows Katherine as she debates if she should have a second child with her estranged and troubled baby daddy. It is meant to be a Catastrophe-like single-cam comedy set in London."
The Duchess,Hope it's good katherine Ryan is pretty funny
The Duchess,love Katherine Ryan.  will be checking this out.
The Duchess,Can someone explain the title?
The Duchess,"I live near to the Shaftesbury tavern, it is opposite to a big housing state before Archway and next to crouch end"
The Duchess,This show is fantastic
The Duchess,That looks shit
The Duchess,Looks lame.
The Duchess,Is this funny?
The Duchess,"I've seen her on would I lie to you, Travel Man and Taskmaster and I do not like her"
The Duchess,[removed]
The Duchess,It is is crouch end
The Duchess,"Kathrine Ryan's been sort of just hovering at the edge of this sort of thing for the longest time. 

This doesn't look like my thing but I'll give it a go anyways because I would like to live in a world where Kathrine Ryan is coming up."
The Duchess,"I assume it's a bit of irony.  A fancy title because on paper she's an attractive, single, semi-famous comedienne living in the city which sounds all nice and hip but she's actually a bit vulgar."
The Duchess,Please stop posting
The Duchess,"Don’t get you knickers in such a twist! I was only being slightly harsh in my assessment of the trailer for The Duchess. It looks like an awful show. 

I do feel that, for better or worse, Netflix will have less incentive to make so many British shows from 2021 onwards. You disagree with that? I’m also of the opinion that Netflix should do a better job of informing people when they cancel shows. What is wrong with asking for a bit more transparency?"
The Duchess,"Yes it looks awful. No I'm not going to watch it. 

what I have a problem with is this 

""At least Brexit means there will be less stuff like this going forward at Netflix since they cannot use British stuff to meet those EU quotas any more.""

This is just verbal diarrhea"
The Duchess,Are you saying that the proposed 30% content quota the EU was trying to put in place for streaming companies never passed into law? All the reports I read last year made it sound like a sure thing.
The Duchess,Nothing but respect for a Taskmaster champion
The Duchess,No idea who she is but good for her!
The Duchess,Is she very popular in England? The times I've seen her she was good but seemed to be doing a Rita Rudner impression.
The Duchess,Who?
The Duchess,[deleted]
The Duchess,"She's a well-known comedian, panel show regular. 

&#x200B;

Use Google if don't know a famous person instead of commenting ""who?"""
The Duchess,Is she well received ? Haven’t heard of her before!
The Duchess,[deleted]
The Duchess,I adore her.
The Duchess,"I'm a fan of hers. At least on panel shows. I was actually surprised about the original question, because my question was going to be if she was big outside of the UK. All I know her from is panel shows."
The Duchess,"Yeah as a dual English/Canadian, I’m lost as to the appeal. And I love panel shows."
The Duchess,"There are a few stand-up shows floating around out there, two on Netflix. Of the three shows I've seen, I thought the earliest was pretty weak (inoffensive but also didn't really laugh at anything - about what you'd expect if you've only seen the panel shows), but the more recent ones were a lot sharper and I really enjoyed them.

But y'know, humour is extremely subjective, so your mileage may vary."
The Duchess,"Ye same and she gets onto a lot of panels and UK shows which bewilders me, far better female comedians on the circuits to bring in."
The Duchess,"The review is flawed, but the show really is a mess. I love Katherine Ryan's comedy. She owns sexuality, and at the same time she is super critical towards white privilege.

To me, the real issue of this show is that the elephant in the room is never really addressed, just casually brushed off: the extremely unhealthy relationship between the lead and her daughter. 

During one of the last confrontations, the show even seems to take the opposite side, under the ""my child my choice"" flag. Such lack of emotional boundaries and self awareness becomes too much, to the point of really not working anymore with the comedy.

This is a Fleabag kind of show. Where the comedy is there to express profound, deep mental distress. After a while, it's not even entertaining.

Not that all art must be entertaining, of course."
The Duchess,"I would probably hate watching that show (not a fan of just mean-spirited characters), but this isn't a good review. It looks like the reviewer was offended by offensive comedy, which is sort of the point."
The Duchess,"I want to watch it more now, honestly"
The Duchess,"I don't know if it's any good because I haven't seen it but the following excerpts from the review lead my to discount the reviewer's opinions:

>But would it surprise you to learn that the woman [an adoption case worker] Katherine calls dirtier than a dog and a purveyor of — again, for emphasis — “second hand crack babies” is Black, and that Katherine is white? If not, why not?

That's a weird way to shoehorning in racism where there may very well not be any. The implication is that a black actor can't be cast in the role of the adoption case worker because the crack babies line might be perceived to be about the ethnicity of the character/actor. Drug-addicted children do get put up for adoption. The character said they'd even take one of these children, with all their problems. The actor's ethnicity is not relevant here unless someone is looking to be offended and living the woke life on a hair-trigger. This is a British TV show (albeit one created by a Canadian) where we don't have to make everything about race in every occasion, all of the time (at least not at the time of writing). Ridiculous.

And:

> As someone who is a parent by adoption, it hurts me, deeply, to see a TV show take a long moment to appreciate what it represents as the craft of Katherine’s way with insults, ones that cut across whole swaths of people and experiences so mindlessly. It’s furthermore painful to watch stupid behavior, and stupid writing, treated by its creator as subversively intelligent. I, unlike Katherine, believe people who have been adopted, like my daughter, can do anything.

Sounds like the reviewer is especially triggered by this and has decided to take it all personally.

From the trailer I saw the show is probably not going to be something I'll watch. It may very well be dreadful, but this review isn't up to much either."
The Duchess,"Show was overall ridiculous, but, admittedly, had me LOL a few times. The main character is just way too unlikable. I don't know the last time I disliked a lead so much. And she's a terrible mother, seeing as she's really not a mom so much, as opposed to a lonely woman who has only her child to rely on. Poor Olive"
The Duchess,"The entire article is written in such an angry tone, that I'm having a lot of trouble believing this person ever even attempted to be unbiased while reviewing this show.

I usually like Katherine's comedy, so I'm gonna reserve judgment until I see this for myself."
The Duchess,I only know Katherine Ryan from her work on The Fix and I enjoyed her on that. So no review is going to make me not try out this show
The Duchess,Yeah this shows just crazy. The plot literally doesn’t make sense.
The Duchess,Well I'm definitely watching this now!
The Duchess,">To wit, when she calls her daughter’s schoolmate a “tasteless little ditch pig,”

If this means ""ditch pig"" is finally happening, huzzah!"
The Duchess,"I found it hilarious that she addressed “white feminism” in a few moments where it made for a good comedic retort and then managed to exercise a perfect example of white feminism. self sufficient creative making boob pottery (as a ceramicist this immediately was unrealistic) with a (light skin) black business partner who critiques her but somehow never draws the line with her selfishness, and then she verbally attacks one of the only dark skin black women in the show who is LITERALLY DOING HER JOB AS A SOCIAL WORKER because she suggests that her daughters behavior is out of line (it WAS). yes you can decry that its not directly racist and i dont think it was her intention to be so tone deaf about it but thats…also white feminism"
The Duchess,i enjoyed it
The Duchess,pretty fucking funny tho
The Duchess,[removed]
The Duchess,Yeah I got a bootleg Gilmore girls vibe from it
The Duchess,"Well I haven't watched fleabag but the relationship between the lead and her daughter really concerns me. No one addressing that. 
Just watched the show , really good initiative about single mother's life with a no help father but I can't get past the fact she lets her 9yr old decide what's best for them. if she wanna be with a guy or not, if she actually want or ready to raise another child or not. Even she doesn't realise what a good father means. Mother and father having a good relationship both present both providing is important. But a 9 yr old decides what's best. I just couldn't.... !!!!!"
The Duchess,It’s fantastic so far
The Duchess,[deleted]
The Duchess,"Ah yes, ""crack babies,"" a phrase with a notoriously race-neutral history. Do you live on planet earth?"
The Duchess,"Oh, abso-fricking-lutely. In Fleabag, the massive character work is evident. It comes from the stage play she wrote and performed herself, after all. It makes sense.

The issue I have with The Duchess is that her character is just too much for a drama. Comedy? Sure. Everything is exaggerated there. But if you want me to deeply care about the characters from a ""drama"" perspective, then her character's idiosyncrasies are just too much. It's absurd. 

I really like her stand up, as I love Nikki and Whitney Cummings. I just believe the show misses the mark because it stays between comedy and drama without really being neither. 

Character work might have helped. But I believe the issue to be in the writing."
The Duchess,"I didn’t even read the article, just came to read the comments as I’m on episode 4 of the show, and this review totally nails it for me. Thank you."
The Duchess,YES!! I kept saying it to my girlfriend!
The Duchess,I think it worth noting that while the adoption issue is a personal one for the reviewer the issue she points out is still relevant. If this is supposed to be a witty and clever comedy show then it should be called out for trotting out a harmful and tired trope.
The Duchess,Because art shouldn't connect with lives or emotions?
The Duchess,"Do you live in a state of constant outrage? You should know that stress chemicals have been linked to brain cancer, you're doing yourself no favors."
The Duchess,"> Do you live in a state of constant outrage? 

im quite sure most americans do, it seems so weird from the outside."
The Duchess,does the photo not exist in the internet?
The Duchess,I always chuckle when women make statements like these. Pretty much all you need to do as a woman to be 'good' at sex is to be willing and present.
The Duchess,"Apparently not: ""The photographs have never been officially released to the public""

The Idhun Chronicles,"It was a great series and one of my favorites. The first two seasons aired on ABC and didn't get the ratings they were hoping for. It was not a cheap show and filmed all over the world. I think viewers expected movie-like adventures (Harrison Ford did play Indy for one episode) instead of a coming-of-age story.  Family Channel took it over and aired the final four films. Lucas envisioned it as an educational project which could be shown in schools to get kids interested in historical figures. 

When they brought it out on DVD, they included a lot of supplemental material and reworked and paired the episodes into 22 two-hour movies. They added some new clips to make some episodes work together. The youngest version of Indy, Corey Carrier, had grown quite a bit by this point, so they digitally shrank him to make him look younger in the new footage. They dumped the series' George Hall as elderly Indy bookends and that was okay with me. 

In the fourth Indiana Jones feature film, Indy mentioned that he rode with Pancho Villa, a direct reference to the two-hour premiere of Young Indy. Most didn't get the reference but it made me smile that the show hasn't completely been forgotten."
The Idhun Chronicles,I really enjoyed this show back in the day. Not sure why Disney+ hasn't put this up on their service. Maybe they're waiting for this summer?
The Idhun Chronicles,"I just watched a video about this show over the weekend.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gmF0OacqeY&t=947s"
The Idhun Chronicles,"It’s such a fun premise for a series and the cast is great, so I can mostly forgive it for not being very good."
The Idhun Chronicles,"The books were great choose your own adventure, but I enjoyed the other series of young Indiana that didn't correspond to the show. Love how he'd just pop up somewhere new every book, Colorado, Ireland, the South, China, Russia, and giving young me a little taste of the area."
The Idhun Chronicles,"The best episode was the one in Prague. ""Just instal a phone at the new location, as simple as that"" .. or similary worded"
The Idhun Chronicles,"I'd rather see a ""Young Indian Jones"" movie than another old Indiana Jones movie."
The Idhun Chronicles,"I didn't like the first few episodes where Indy was a kid but when Sean Patrick Flannery took over playing teen Indy is when the show really took off.

Watching this show sparked my interest in WW1 history.

If you stalled out watching kid Indy like I did give the show another chance and skip to where he joins up to fight in WW1."
The Idhun Chronicles,"Could be a rights issue. The show was co-produced by Lucasfilm, Amblin Television, and Paramount Television"
The Idhun Chronicles,It’s on Paramount+
The Idhun Chronicles,Haven't seen that video yet and will surely watch it all! Thanks!
The Idhun Chronicles,"Indy's most frustrating adventure yet -- trying to get a phone installed in Prague and filling out confusing paperwork. There are tons of hilarious Kafka references in the episode. Franz Kafka is shown working at an insurance company and he takes pity on Indy. Kafka had already written Metamorphosis by this point but watching Indy, he's supposedly inspired to write The Trial."
The Idhun Chronicles,"That was a fun one. The whole bit was a take on the themes of Kafka's work, who he also runs into."
The Idhun Chronicles,I felt the same way. To be honest I never finished an episode with the first Indy. It did take off with Sean indeed. The WWI episodes were the best. The fact it has so much WWI content is what makes this series so unique. Great that it sparked your interest in it.
The Idhun Chronicles,I've got Paramount+ and haven't been able to find it. Just the movies. I'm in America.
The Idhun Chronicles,"Such a good series. When I was a young teen my dad took me and some friends to Six Flags and just let us loose while he posted up outside to read this. He got through like half of it that day. I think he had more fun than we did lol. 

After that I read it and understood."
The Idhun Chronicles,"I've been wanting this since I was a kid in the 80's! Hell yeah! Bring us weird, multiverse hellscape, psychedelic family melodrama!"
The Idhun Chronicles,Read those books in high school - early 1980s. Never though it would be produced!
The Idhun Chronicles,"I remember reading the first book a long, long time ago."
The Idhun Chronicles,"Loved the books as a teenager.  Like Game of Thrones on Acid.  Hopefully they can recreate the profound strangeness of the books.  A dynastic struggle across space and time for control over all-reality will require a decent budget.

Also, fingers crossed, they cast people with fencing experience because there’s a lot of swordplay in the books.  In-universe most technology becomes difficult to use the closer one gets to Amber."
The Idhun Chronicles,someone tell GRRM
The Idhun Chronicles,"> Stephen Colbert, a noted fantasy fan, has come on board to help develop and produce a series adaptation of Roger Zelazny’s The Chronicles of Amber.


> **Colbert, via his Spartina banner, will produce the adaptation alongside Robert Kirkman’s Skybound Entertainment.**


> 'The Chronicles of Amber' features two series of five books each – The Corwin Cycle and The Merlin Cycle – with a number of short stories and prequels also in the series.


> **It follows the story of Corwin, who awakens on Earth with no memory, but soon finds he is a prince of a royal family that has the ability to travel through different dimensions of reality, called shadows, and rules over the one true world, Amber.**



Sounds great, hopefully one day we will get 'Lord of Light' TV series as well."
The Idhun Chronicles,"The way my heart leapt into my throat. This was something my dad recommended to me before he went off the deep end, and to this day is still one of the best series I've ever read. I trust Colbert, famed LOTR nerd, to get the details right? Cautiously optimistic."
The Idhun Chronicles,"About fucking time.  I ran a dice-less Amber RPG campaign for several years, back in the 90's.  I'm glad Colbert has a say in production."
The Idhun Chronicles,"Oh, this could be interesting, but the endless series of underwhelming fantasy books adaptions taught me to not get my hopes up too much. So I'll wait for it skeptically, but I'll still wait for it."
The Idhun Chronicles,What a great series.
The Idhun Chronicles,"This series was my Bible when I was a kid. I *knew* Corwin and Eric and Random and the rest of the family like they were my own relatives. 

I trust Stephen to do this RIGHT."
The Idhun Chronicles,My favorite fantasy novel as a kid. So glad this is finally happening.
The Idhun Chronicles,YAY! This is going to be so amazing.
The Idhun Chronicles,Holy fuck that is awesome.
The Idhun Chronicles,"Looking forward to this,  but will be curious to see how they handle walking through shadows.  That is one of my favorite parts of the books, and a great concept, but won’t be easy - or cheap - to do.  It would be amazing if done well, but they could decide to just downplay it."
The Idhun Chronicles,"No way! I’ve read this collection like 5 times, no joke. An amazing and creative story RZ authored. Just hope they don’t F it up like Spielberg did with Ready Player One. That was trash"
The Idhun Chronicles,"No!

Fucking!

Way!

!
This series was one of the most mind-fuck stories I've ever read!
Best of luck to the show to pull off this extremely cerebral storyline."
The Idhun Chronicles,"Best of luck.

I'm not one of those ""It's unfilmable!"" guys but there's a reason a lot of really great Zelazny has remained unadapted.  All of his stuff is like adaptation hard mode. A lot of his big moments or plot twists hinge upon you not really having access to the visuals. It's a lot of prose fuckery.

Especially if they're going the series route, I imagine they're going to be taking a LOT of liberties with the source material.

But... if it works, they're geniuses. If it doesn't work, then it was obviously a terrible idea from the start. All sins are forgiven if it's \*good\*.

Anyway, I love (the first half) of all the Amber stuff. I'll be rooting for this not to suck. Good luck!"
The Idhun Chronicles,Remember him talking about this on the The Friendship Onion podcast. Might have to check the books out.
The Idhun Chronicles,"I love these books, but I have no idea how you make a series about them. They’re sprawling, complex, and the prose style is part of the charm."
The Idhun Chronicles,My mom brought the full set home from a garage sale. Read them all in like a week and a half in 8th grade.
The Idhun Chronicles,Such great books!  Fun role playing game too!
The Idhun Chronicles,"Pfft, I'm still waiting for an adaptation of Colbert's own sci-fi masterpiece: *Stephen Colbert Presents Stephen Colbert's Alpha Squad 7: A Tek Jansen Adventure*"
The Idhun Chronicles,Which character will be the Trump stand in?
The Idhun Chronicles,I wish Stephen Colbert was making it instead of Stephen Colbert
The Idhun Chronicles,The least funny man on tv is taking his lack of talent and applying it to other stuff
The Idhun Chronicles,[deleted]
The Idhun Chronicles,Which channel or streaming service?
The Idhun Chronicles,Played Amber TTRPG and the GM saw I enjoyed the setting and said I could usually pick up the books used. I remember loving the Corwin books but lost interest in the Merlin ones. I should revisit those one of these days.
The Idhun Chronicles,"I've asked/talked about this for years. I always thought the people I trusted most to be authentic and do a good job producing it would be Tom Hanks and Ron Howard. I'm excited and scared for this. I like Steven, but he lost a lot of major points for me when he talks about how good the Hobbit movies are. We shall see!"
The Idhun Chronicles,Another great series of my childhood just like deltora quest. I'd love to get them finally to read again on my old kindle but yikes...too expensive for me.
The Idhun Chronicles,The light bulb city?
The Idhun Chronicles,"My father has a book collection in the 10,000+ range. I would bet half are Sci-fi. How I’ve never seen them on his shelves is surprising to me."
The Idhun Chronicles,"I have been waiting for sooooo long for someone to finally do a series on those novels. That said, I worry this is going to be a hard sell for alot of people who have never read the series or know nothing about it."
The Idhun Chronicles,"We can’t fix the shattering with science and human hands. 

Only the first mover can."
The Idhun Chronicles,Some of the early ones were serialized in sci fi magazines of the time. I picked up a grocery bag full of them as a kid and devoured them. That’s how I got into the series.
The Idhun Chronicles,[deleted]
The Idhun Chronicles,"What the fuck, this cunt is a lunatic. No doubt there will be a vaccine dance and the villain will be a trump clone under this clown"
The Idhun Chronicles,Based
The Idhun Chronicles,"Yeah if they do this true to the books, it’ll be great!!"
The Idhun Chronicles,"Also read them in school, 2010 :)"
The Idhun Chronicles,"They've been on my ""to read"" list for, like, 30-something years."
The Idhun Chronicles,Are these the books with the dude that has a god hand and eye at one point?
The Idhun Chronicles,"I remember I read the first series of books during the lunch breaks in my first job after college, so that was... 31 years ago... yikes."
The Idhun Chronicles,except for that one time corwin figured out how to bring in AK’s
The Idhun Chronicles,"I think it could be a good fit for Apple TV, their shows have been beautiful so far."
The Idhun Chronicles,It sounds like this is going to be really hard to pull off. If he doesn't get HBO it's going to be a crapshoot. If he gets HBO I give it a 50% chance.
The Idhun Chronicles,Lol I just started reading the series based on his comments
The Idhun Chronicles,Knew I recognized the title from somewhere. Didn't GRRM take a lot of his inspiration for aSoIaF from this series?
The Idhun Chronicles,"To be fair, Lord of Light is a barely fleshed out treatise.  The last three chapters are basically notes.  It would take a *lot* of creative interpretation.  Don’t get me wrong, it’s one of my favorite books."
The Idhun Chronicles,">      
> 
> Sounds great, hopefully one day we will get 'Lord of Light' TV series as well.

Last time there was a rumored adaptation of it, it was actually the cover story for the CIA to extract people from the Canadian embassy in Iran.

And remember: Argo fuck yourself."
The Idhun Chronicles,Lord of light adaptation would be amazing!!
The Idhun Chronicles,"When Colbert was on Dominic Monaghan and Billy Boyd's podcast, they talked about different Fantasy/sci-fi books they also love and Colbert brought up the series, he is a big fan."
The Idhun Chronicles,"While agreeing you’re probably right to be doubtful here, there are two things that give me hope. 

The Chronicles of Amber are a complete story, so whatever gets made can follow from beginning to end. 

Stephen Colbert is a huge nerd and, based on his LOTR fandom, is likely to push the production to follow the original story instead of just making shit up and calling it Amber."
The Idhun Chronicles,I understand what you mean. I’ll even take mediocre in some cases tho. That Shannara show that MTV had briefly…. I would have like more of that. It could have gotten molded into something.
The Idhun Chronicles,"Me, too! And I ended up marrying a man named Gerard."
The Idhun Chronicles,"Glad I'm not the only one who was thinking that. I mean, most of the style of the book is just lost without Corwin's narration. (And later Merlin's, but same thing really.) Maybe they'll actually just bite the bullet and do a voiceover?"
The Idhun Chronicles,"There is one character who will almost certainly be it. It's been years since I read it, but I want to say Eric?"
The Idhun Chronicles,Colbert is hilarious. Maybe you just have a shitty sense of humor.
The Idhun Chronicles,Dude… Colbert is hilarious!  Have you ever seen the “vax-scene” bit.  It’s legendary!  Definitely better than Chris farley’s van down by the river.
The Idhun Chronicles,"I think something changed with him, I don't think it's a consequence of the format change or anything like that. The spark just isn't there. It's like a TV show has depression."
The Idhun Chronicles,You seem bitter
The Idhun Chronicles,"Wow. Show me on the doll where the bad comedian hurt you, buddy."
The Idhun Chronicles,He got TDS and lost his mind. Its never coming back
The Idhun Chronicles,He mocked stupid people putting themselves at risk for no rational reason.
The Idhun Chronicles,"Yeah, well maybe people shouldn’t be thinking they know better than scientists because they read a couple of articles on Facebook, it’s really hard for me to feel sorry for them"
The Idhun Chronicles,"I didn't read them in school, 2005"
The Idhun Chronicles,"I found mine at the back-est back of my school's library. All nine - was it nine?

At the time, it felt so ahead of its time, risky, and adult, I thought there was no way I'd ever see even a movie. But then budgets exploded and we are where we are."
The Idhun Chronicles,Quick and easy fantasy pulp fiction taken to the highest extent of the genre. Jump in and swim in the beauty of their nature you wont regret it.
The Idhun Chronicles,"That sounds more like Corum Jhaelen Irsei, with the Hand of Kwll and the Eye of Rhynn."
The Idhun Chronicles,No he has no eyes at one point.
The Idhun Chronicles,"I doubt it’ll be HBO, they just finished his dark materials which sounds kinda similar but it didn’t do very well"
The Idhun Chronicles,"Martin’s included little references to Zelazny in his newer world books, such as House Rogers of Amberly (a minor stormlands family), Qarl Correy, and the mazemakers of Lorath."
The Idhun Chronicles,"Not as such, but there are a lot of Zelazny references and homages in asoiaf.  They were friends a long time ago, before Zelazny passed away."
The Idhun Chronicles,"He took a TON of inspiration from Tad Williams Memory, Sorrow, and Thorn series."
The Idhun Chronicles,"Are yóu crazy, the ending was great, far from notes. It requires no interpretation, just copy the book as it is."
The Idhun Chronicles,"A “complete story” doesn’t prevent renegade writers from using the IP as a vehicle for their terrible fan fiction. Just look at how they butchered Wheel of Time. 

That being said, Colbert’s involvement is reason for hope."
The Idhun Chronicles,"Amber wasn't really a complete story given how many major plot threads are left dangling at the end. If the author hadn't passed away he had plans to get back into it.  And given how incredibly abrupt and anticlimactic the last scene is, coming off more like set up for the next arc, it's pretty disingenuous to pretend otherwise."
The Idhun Chronicles,"Probably being true to a story does not make a good premium drama. It is a start, but it's not enough to be optimistic over. It's all about who makes it and, of course, how well they execute."
The Idhun Chronicles,"I don't know, he is a partisan talk show host. All he does is try and make all democrats and their talking points sound good. Anything a conservative does he tries to make sound bad even if its something he praised a Dem senator for a year prior. Shit I'm a communist but he is so pro establishment it grosses me out.


I could see him trying to turn villians into trump and having fantasy characters endorea 2023 Dem party talking points as the morality of the book. Def don't see him changing everything to throw identity politics everywhere."
The Idhun Chronicles,"""The best of us all."""
The Idhun Chronicles,"Think of Zelazny as  akin to Raymond Chandler. They've done Chandler badly, and they've done Chandler well -- but it can certainly be done. The zip of Zelazny's dialogue will translate. The ironic egdes of the character will translate. If they do it well, it should still feel like Zelazny."
The Idhun Chronicles,One of my favorite things about the series is how much of the story is colored by Corwin and Merlin's narration. They're both very different in their thought process and it drastically impacts how the reader interprets the plot.
The Idhun Chronicles,"Agree to disagree. Say what you want about Eric , but he was legitimately concerned about Amber's well-being and was perfectly willing to risk his own life in a fight to defend it. He even had a chance to use his death curse on Corwin and didn't, instead setting it on the enemies of Amber. 

He was nowhere near self-serving and petty enough to be a Trump stand in."
Julie and the Phantoms,"unsurprising. the show came out last year in september, and there was no word of them making s2, both kenny ortega and the cast were basically all over social media making sure fans kept begging netflix to renew it.

it's weird it took netflix over a year to cancel it. maybe they just forgot the show existed"
Julie and the Phantoms,life isn't good on the other side of hollywood
Julie and the Phantoms,"""This is Netflix, you're green lit!""

6 months later: ""This is Netflix, you're cancelled!"""
Julie and the Phantoms,"That's surprising, it seemed like this show had a really strong fan base."
Julie and the Phantoms,"Aw, that's too bad. It was a sweet little show with a kind of 90's hopefulness to it that you just don't get on TV anymore these days."
Julie and the Phantoms,"Didn’t it take like 2 years and constant fan petitions before they announced this? Meanwhile Cowboy Bebop which went #1 in US got canned after 3 weeks? I know there’s data on all of us from Netflix, but of all the premium networks they’re the ones whose renewal strategy confuses the most."
Julie and the Phantoms,"Nooo, this was such a cute show. The music was also impressively good."
Julie and the Phantoms,"Well, that's a bummer. It was a cute, fun show."
Julie and the Phantoms,I don't get netflix's strategy at all. This was an adorable show for all ages that had a huge following
Julie and the Phantoms,"Nooo, I didn't thought I would like it but I really did!"
Julie and the Phantoms,My wife and I both really enjoyed this show! Sad to see this
Julie and the Phantoms,My wife and I actually really liked this show and the music too. They kinda left it on a cliffhanger of course.
Julie and the Phantoms,"Is the name inspired by ""Jem and the holograms""?"
Julie and the Phantoms,"When Netflix takes over a year to make an announcement, it's never great news. 

I hope the cast goes on to bigger and better projects in the future."
Julie and the Phantoms,Netflix cancels everything. I don’t even bother with their original series.
Julie and the Phantoms,"I honestly don't see Netflix lasting another 6 years in its current form.

Amazon / Disney doing it far better and can rely on other revenue streams.

Netflix is just destroying trust with viewers by cancelling shows etc. Why should I invest in any never project they make when there is a high risk it will get cancelled."
Julie and the Phantoms,Looks like some shitty Disney high school musical
Julie and the Phantoms,"There was some buzz on the show early on. It had a nice little rumble among the teens and young adult set on social media. I am guessing Netflix waited to see if it would build into something stronger. 

Guess it didn't."
Julie and the Phantoms,"Yeah no, this show was massively popular and most definitely good enough to get another season. 

The show had a million followers on Instagram which is very representative of the number of people watching. To compare to it’s direct competitor, High School Musical: The Musical: The Series, it has about 400K more followers on Instagram, and that show literally jumpstarted the career of Olivia Rodrigo, the number one pop star in the world right now. 

As well as this, the show has a 93% critics score and a 98% audience score. JATP was also nominated for 13 Emmy’s, and won 3 of them. 

The streams on Spotify has millions of streams, with the most popular song having 40M+ streams. Double that because Apple Music usually has the same number of streams. This show brought in MONEY. 

The cancellation is EXTREMELY surprising. It is one of Netflix’s biggest and most successful children’s shows and was doing objectively better than it’s competitor on Disney+."
Julie and the Phantoms,Cancel culture strikes again.
Julie and the Phantoms,"Cowboy Bebop had a massive budget, production delays, also was widely panned. I suspect it had a lot of people watch the first episode or two but few finished the series. This was likely a cheap production, but still largely unknown and unpopular. Its weird it wasn't cancelled a while ago, but Cowboy Bebop seems to have been a bomb.

And tbh, I don't really know how much value we need to put in Netflix's top ten. I'd wager that they're always going to pump up their bigger shows on the list."
Julie and the Phantoms,Did it have a huge following? I've never heard of it but I doubt I'm its audience.
Julie and the Phantoms,"I cannot comprehend how people on Reddit question why Netflix cancels shows. Unlike traditional tv which guesstimated their audience, and relied heavily on advertising, Netflix knows exactly how many people watch their show and most people discover Netflix shows on the homepage of Netflix itself, otherwise word of mouth is another big one.

If a show does not pull in people, Netflix know this without a shadow of a doubt. It's so weird reading this circle jerk every time some show on Netflix is cancelled. Every network cancels shows, but at least with these streaming networks, it makes sense, because they actually know with certainty how much these shows are worth to their platform.

Netflix also blitzes everyone else in sheer volume of content, so naturally there'll be a lot of cancellations. My only problem when a shows is cancelled is if there's unresolved story. No show should end its first season on a cliffhanger unless its already got a greenlight for its second season."
Julie and the Phantoms,"You think they’d cancel a show that’s bringing in/retaining subs?

Maybe they would if there was some extenuating circumstance beyond their control, otherwise if the metrics support keeping it they keep it. If not, they cancel it. 

Netflix is a tech company, even the newer steamers are being run more like a tech company than a traditional studio. Data data data. That’s what drives them."
Julie and the Phantoms,"the show was very disney, and that's probably why it didn't become something stronger(wouldn't shock me at all to find out ortega had pitched the show to disney and they said no, and then he managed to get netflix to do it). the disney shows also have strong followings, but they're not dedicated followings, so it doesn't grow into something big.

there's also some rumor that's been going around about how netflix wanted the show to branch irl, and do sorta what highschool musical, glee, hannah montana, big time rush did, where they have the actors go on tour in between filming the seasons, and because of covid, they weren't able to follow through with that, and decided to just cancel the whole project now that the omicron variant is threatening to make us go back to more restrictive measures"
Julie and the Phantoms,"it isn't surprising because it took them over a year to say anything about it.

kenny, the cast and the fans have been waiting for over a year to get news. no one knew the fate of the show. and at least to me, it took netflix way too long to make an announcement.

during the year between airing and cancellation, netflix released plenty of shows and announced their renewal within weeks, and the same for cancellations. young royals, aired, quickly got renewed, jupiter's legacy, aired, quickly got cancelled.

jatp aired in september 2020, a year and 3 months went by before an announcement of cancellation. that is a ridiculous long time to announce the future of the show. especially one that had creator, cast and fandom constantly begging fore renewal news. so to me, it wasn't surprising at all that the show got cancelled, because netflix went a long ass time saying nothing about it"
Julie and the Phantoms,"I suppose I’m biased because it was the first Netflix show I got into in ages, and it’s immediately canned. I’m grateful it made international content like Squid Game and my fave French sitcom The Hook Up Plan, but Netflix lives in its own bubble. Barring truly culture defining shows like Stranfer Things, most netflix things have been or are going to be quickly forgotten. 

It’s my personal beef with “content.” As much as CB took inspiration from its source material, it was one of the few things I’ve seen outside of a theater that didn’t feel so generic and algorithm driven. There was passion behind it, which I just don’t see in much Netflix content now."
Julie and the Phantoms,"This show was NOT unpopular, it has millions of followers, 40M+ streams on their songs, and won 3 emmys"
Julie and the Phantoms,"It might have died off a little now, but it definitely did when it came out last year. The main cast got over a million followers on instagram in a very short amount of time"
Julie and the Phantoms,">My only problem when a shows is cancelled is if there's unresolved story. No show should end its first season on a cliffhanger unless its already got a greenlight for its second season.

and even with that, I wouldn't blame Netflix for that, because as far as I'm aware, they don't tell the writers to end their seasons on a cliffhanger. Don't want the show you make to end on a cliffhanger? maybe don't end the season on a cliffhanger"
Julie and the Phantoms,"For me it's mostly the cliffhangers. If you make a season that feels mostly complete but with room to expand, that's fine.

But also I feel like they're only letting the top 1% through. I wish they'd give more of the shows that did decent but not amazing a second chance. A lot of shows don't find their footing until a couple of seasons in but by then Netflix will already have canceled it."
Julie and the Phantoms,"Because the reality that a massive center for the production of art is being run by tech-gurus saying ""hmm, it says a great complex line like 'Baby, I'll always love you if you don't break my heart' here would add 5,648.6 viewers 🤓"" is a dystopia so horrifying that it shatters the mind to try to truly comprehend."
Julie and the Phantoms,"People are questioning it because all of the publicly available data at the time of release pointed to this show being a huge success. Someone else summarized above, but the music streams got big numbers, the show won multiple awards, the Instagram following is larger than shows it competes within and the review scores are in the 90’s. 

After not hearing anything for a year I’m not surprised it’s cancelled, but I am surprised that it took this long to make a decision."
Julie and the Phantoms,"Having lots of data doesn't necessarily mean you are interpreting it correctly and having too much data can make that harder. It also doesn't mean you are collecting data on the right things. I'm not saying they were wrong to cancel this show. I've never even heard of it. Just that the fact that they have a lot of raw data doesn't mean they always make the correct decisions regarding cancellations, like some people argue it does.

The data would have probably told AMC to cancel Mad Men and Breaking Bad in the early seasons for example."
Julie and the Phantoms,Yeah well cancelling all their shows and leaving them on cliffhangers is eventually gonna catch up to them. I'm already done getting invested in Netflix shows
Julie and the Phantoms,That makes complete sense. I could see a tour coming out from this. Which could have become a huge thing that would have launched a merchandise craze. It was a potential gold mine. But that virus...
Julie and the Phantoms,"Ok so I just found out the real reason. The original creators of the 2011 Brazilian show wanted more money after their one season contract was lifted. They dragged this out for months and eventually when they got back, Netflix found it too expensive to purchase so they canned the show. 

However, the original show aired in Nick Brazil. The new show could be renewed on Paramount+"
Julie and the Phantoms,And all of that is fairly meaningless if it's a financial failure or people don't watch it. Apparently most people didn't finish the season which is a recipe for cancelation.
Julie and the Phantoms,"Cancellation after 1-2 seasons has always been common for shows that bomb hard, unfortunately, even in the cable era. It’s too bad that the Bebop adaptation didn’t work out, but if Netflix kept throwing money at bombs they’d go out of business pretty quickly."
Julie and the Phantoms,It was also pretty big on tumblr.
Julie and the Phantoms,"Not gonna get any disagreement on this. 

The counter I bet tech lead streamers would have is that they don’t care if they cancel the next Breaking Bad or Mad Men as long as they don’t keep a dozen other duds around hoping for a late boom. 

They’re happy to only stick with what the numbers tell them."
Julie and the Phantoms,"The hyperbole is strong with this one. 

Last I checked they had a cancellation rate similar or even lower than some classic networks. They just put out wayy more content so more stuff gets cancelled but statistically it’s the same. It’s so annoying seeing all the shit talk about Netflix when we’re all still there watching their new hyped shows anyways"
Julie and the Phantoms,"I don’t disagree. And not that consumers should have to think about this, but it’s worth noting we’re still in the Wild West phase of steaming. Things will “normalize” to a some degree. And there will be data on data on data, some of which will likely point to subscriber sentiment/behavior regarding cancellations. 

It’s also likely that consumer habits will evolve over time as well. Who knows we might end up with more limited series."
Julie and the Phantoms,Its the fault of the binge model. Cant write an ending before you know the show is ending.
Julie and the Phantoms,"Better yet is the amount of reality shows they’ve essentially doubled the past few years. Like, I don’t know anyone watching Twenty Somethings Austin but it’s on the charts!"
Julie and the Phantoms,"I don't think Netflix has been too crazy with cancellations, but I'll never forgive them for cancelling Santa Clarita Diet. I always get mad scrolling through Netflix and see it pop up..."
Julie and the Phantoms,They dont cancel all their shows though. They are renewing and finishing much more than cancelling which isnt different than other studious. Even recently Disney and HBO cancelled many shows too.
Julie and the Phantoms,"Do you have a source for that? I'm not doubting you, I just want to read it for myself."
Julie and the Phantoms,"All of that is very true, I just don’t see a lot of risk anymore."
Julie and the Phantoms,">It’s so annoying seeing all the shit talk about Netflix when we’re all still there watching their new hyped shows anyways

How on Earth is this a contradiction? We watch their new hyped stuff and then criticize them for cancelling them on a cliffhanger."
Julie and the Phantoms,"That may be true, I'm not American so I don't follow all the network cancelations. I just can't stand all the cliffhangers. Personally I haven't watched a new Netflix show since, well, JATP

(downvote me all you want.)"
Julie and the Phantoms,"Classic networks, typically, don't try to sell you on their back catalogue."
Julie and the Phantoms,">Cant write an ending before you know the show is ending.

Yes you can. It's pretty easy actually, Buffy managed to do an ending every season"
Julie and the Phantoms,Did any one checked for bots?
Julie and the Phantoms,My friend told me on Discord. I know that seems like really untrustworthy but I’ve known them for a while and I trust them to give me the right information.
Julie and the Phantoms,Making it was the risk.
Julie and the Phantoms,"> We watch their new hyped stuff and then criticize them for cancelling them on a cliffhanger.

Maybe the writers could just not end their shows on a cliffhanger?"
Julie and the Phantoms,"My bad for poor phrasing, the contradiction is how hard reddits hate boner is for Netflix but when something pops off the front page is flooded with discussions and memes"
Julie and the Phantoms,So what are reruns intended to do?
Julie and the Phantoms,Buffy had season endings not show endings.  Except when the network wanted people to think it was over and not just moving to another network. It even had the dawn cliffhanger and all the hints the years before.
Julie and the Phantoms,I absolutely agree.
Julie and the Phantoms,"To fill time. 

They don't really advertise reruns though. They primarily btry to sell the new stuff."
Julie and the Phantoms,"Yes, but most of the season endings could've served as show endings. The show could've been cancelled after a season without warning, and people still would've been satisfied with how it all ended. Everything was pretty much wrapped up by the end of a season.

The Dawn cliffhanger wasn't in a finale."
Julie and the Phantoms,"It starts with some pretty cringy moments in the first episode, but it honestly gets more sincere and mature as it goes on.  Plus the songs are boppers and just get better and better throughout the season.  Netflix Futures has been streaming the soundtrack on a youtube loop for the last week and I’ve tuned in randomly several times a day.

The band does all their own singing and playing.  They had to audition with their instruments.  There is a ton of BTS stuff on youtube from their choreographer and social media.  Shout out to the lead male randomly leading sing-alongs to Mamma Mia, Rolling on the River, and Backstreet Boys on set.

It’s nine half hour episodes.  If you like Kenny Ortega, you’ll like this."
Julie and the Phantoms,"simply amazing, kenny ortega never disappoints."
Julie and the Phantoms,"I'm 23 as well and I'm really enjoying the show. The songs are so good and it really reminds me of some of the early to mid 2000s Disney Channel shows that I loved growing up. 

Also I didn't expect to empty my tear ducts over a show aimed at young teenagers but damn that ""Unsaid Emily"" episode really got me."
Julie and the Phantoms,Thanks for the recommendation. I didn't realize it was a Kenny Ortega piece. I always enjoy his stuff.
Julie and the Phantoms,"It's great and we were lucky enough to get our band shirt on the series. It's worn by Luke throughout episode two!

Julie and the Phantoms,"I really loved it too, especially the Club scene. Song was nuts!"
Julie and the Phantoms,Any songs as good as I Don't Dance from HSM2?
Julie and the Phantoms,I'm almost 30 and loved it! The songs were great! I agree that the first episode doesn't do the show justice. Almost stopped watching but I'm glad I didn't!
Julie and the Phantoms,"Yeah, Unsaid Emily got me too"
Julie and the Phantoms,This looks cute! I'm in.
Julie and the Phantoms,"I came to r/television to see if anyone was talking about this. I’d freaking the cutest. Good songs, the right amount of camp and heart."

Julie and the Phantoms,I had was hoping OA would get a season 3
Julie and the Phantoms,Glow for sure bothers me. Daybreak was fun and definitely santa Clarita diet
Julie and the Phantoms,"Deadly Class isn't a Netflix show.

October Faction got cancelled though."
Julie and the Phantoms,"Kim's Convenience The last episode they put the lights out, that is not a ending?"
Julie and the Phantoms,"I'm not sure what you expect. From shows i've personally watched on this list, Altered Carbon, Luke Cage, Age of Resistance - they finished their current arcs. They might not have Big Finale, but they don't leave some main plots unresolved. Cage and Iron Fists were also cancelled due to Disney pulling their license. Glow got  kinda fucked and got cancelled due to increasing costs of production under COVID regulations. Mindhunter (i assume you mean Netflix production without  *s*) stalled production due to Fincher overthinking everything and moving to other projects.

A lot of best shows in history doesn't have Big Finale. They just... End, and the life continues after cameras are shut down. It doesn't make them in any way bad. Just not every story need Endgame as a finale to tie everything up in neat package. 

For clarity  i would recommend moving all non-originals on the bottom of the list."
Julie and the Phantoms,"My take: very few shows stick the landing. Most shows have to stop, because the audience lost interest, usually because the quality dropped far enough. Why should their finale be anything memorable/mind blowing now? If nothing sticks with me after a series ends, it might as well end on a cliffhanger. Of course I'm sad about premature cancellations of shows I'm currently watching, but it isn't the first and won't be the last time. And when I'm sad about it, then it means it at least entertained me enough to care."
Julie and the Phantoms,"I can't do a list, but I know for a fact that I Am Not Okay With This was cut off at a clifflhanger, but to me it still felt quite satisfying. I hope I helped a bit ^^"
Julie and the Phantoms,"Daredevil

The Get Down - it had an ending, but it was clearly very rushed and the fates of certain characters were never revealed

Dogs of Berlin - Netflix never announced a cancellation, but it’s been 2.5 years since it was released and the final episode was inconclusive"
Julie and the Phantoms,Crazyhead
Julie and the Phantoms,"If it’s not a Netflix Original, it’s not a Netflix show. Take them off the list lol. This thread…"
Julie and the Phantoms,"If you're going to put Iron Fist and Luke Cage on here, you could put all of the other Marvel shows (Daredevil, Punisher, Jessica Jones) on here too. Although I'm not sure they fit as neatly because generally all of the Marvel shows did have resolution to their season plots, just left some foreshadowing for the next seasons open."
Julie and the Phantoms,"I love this subreddits Netflix hate boner… how is this a “problem” for the service?  Networks have canceled shows forever, good and bad, the only difference here is that those mainly disappear from a catalog and Netflix has them there still.

This isn’t a new practice.  Maybe the idea of this thread isn’t a bad one, but it’s phrased in the same overly dramatic way anything about Netflix is posted here."
Julie and the Phantoms,Insatiable
Julie and the Phantoms,Friends From College.
Julie and the Phantoms,Iron Fist and Luke Cage.
Julie and the Phantoms,Hemlock Grove had an ending.
Julie and the Phantoms,Is altered carbon worth watching without a true ending? I was *just* about to start binging it.
Julie and the Phantoms,"I'd love someone else's take, but I wouldn't say Designated Survivor fully had an ending. Netflix took over in Season 3, and then cancelled it."
Julie and the Phantoms,"Thanks for adding Messiah, that show was shockingly smart"
Julie and the Phantoms,Everything ends brother
Julie and the Phantoms,"Probably Glitch Techs, but it still hasn't been officially announced as cancelled."
Julie and the Phantoms,It's Bruno does not fit on this list. The first season was very self contained.
Julie and the Phantoms,I think you'd be better off with a list of finished shows. That would be very short list.
Julie and the Phantoms,The Mist?
Get Organized with The Home Edit,Marie Kondo for white women
Get Organized with The Home Edit,So they just clean and put stuff in tubs and boxes? Revolutionary lol
Get Organized with The Home Edit,I’m a little disappointed so far? I find the girls kind of annoying and their organizing isn’t really special. They just make it a little neater.
Get Organized with The Home Edit,I'd like to imagine this is a secretly a pro unionizing documentary
Get Organized with The Home Edit,I'm loving this show so far! And it's such a relief that what they do is feasible and sustainable for many people. I find some Marie Kondo techniques a bit too much. Cleo and Joanna--the stars of the show--are actually talented but what they do is also practical.
Get Organized with The Home Edit,"I have watched a few episodes and they don't really get rid of much shit. They need to push people to cull more crap. The lady with her garage needed to dump all of that garage sale stuff. She obviously was never going to have a sale, just donate it and move on."
Get Organized with The Home Edit,"I take it as it is but it’s not really home/closet organising. It’s more staging/merchandising especially the way they constantly talk about “product”. 

I found it funny though, they made a production of wearing gloves and carrying Reese’s items in a certain way and then they put their bare feet in her shoes to take a photo."
Get Organized with The Home Edit,I can't stand how blonde girl is constantly pushed around by the brunette.
Get Organized with The Home Edit,"I haven't watched it but I agree with them on one thing, Labels change everything, those made stuffs so much easier."
Get Organized with The Home Edit,I agree with you! Everyone is hating on them but I have changed a lot of things based on how they organized. Yeah it cost some money for containers but I think I actually have a feasible system that is aesthetically pleasing.
Get Organized with The Home Edit,I get what you’re saying. But I’ve read that people on Marie Kondos show didn’t like how they were forced to get rid of things. I think it’s better to mostly work with what you have and go from there.
Get Organized with The Home Edit,"Yes, and they see these containers as ""investment"" pieces that could last a very long time. Less stress is priceless."
Get Organized with The Home Edit,"I can see a middle ground. When you have so much shit it is difficult to find a shirt to wear in the morning because you have shirts from the 5th grade cluttering up your closet you need to get rid of crap. If that makes people sad then they need some counseling for hoarding. But I don't see the point of getting rid of crap just because you don't wear it everyday, but maybe only use it once a quarter. I feel like as long as it isn't causing you stress or taking up precious real estate then keep it. For example, I have been cleaning out my closet. These sweatshirts have been sitting on a shelf , taking up precious space for 5 years, and I've never worn them. Why not put something on that shelf that I actually wear? They went to donation which freed up space for current clothing"
Get Organized with The Home Edit,"I understand that 100%. Although it’s funny, before Covid I purged a ton of t shirts because I don’t just wear t shirts often. At least often enough to need multiple drawers of casual weekend ones. Flash forward to working from home for 7 months and wishing I had more T-shirt’s haha. But I’m usually good about throwing things out (or donating where applicable) so I guess I don’t always have a ton of stuff lingering.

One thing I really liked about the show is how they stress that the organizing needs to work for you. So things like a “drop zone” make sense."
Get Organized with The Home Edit,"I loved Supernatural but I hate prequels.  I mean, Season 1 (and presumably the prequels then) a single demon was a powerhouse that needed several episodes or powerful containment rituals to get past.  They knew nothing of Angels, Leviathans, or any of the biblical heavy-hitters.  We're supposed to go back to a time when a single demon was like a season boss?"
Get Organized with The Home Edit,"I don't see how they are going to get all of the supernatural audience back with this. 

A large portion of them saw John as an abusive father and not a character they like. Others hated Mary and loved John

Honestly the reason none of the back door pilots worked is because the large parts of the supernatural audience were watching a different show. 

Some like the sandbox, some like the brothers platonic codependency, others love the idea of found family, or the main fandom ship. This is just not a fandom that would ever agree with each other on what they wanted to see and you're never going to get a large enough chunk of them back."
Get Organized with The Home Edit,"Goddamit Jensen stop wasting your career on this shit, you have so much more potential than making Supernatutal Season 30 or whatever."
Get Organized with The Home Edit,With the CW network being sold I do not see the point? Not like they are eager to order shows like this for HBO Max! This show will be gone by the end of the season along with the rest of the scripted roster at the CW.
Get Organized with The Home Edit,This is a gigantic waste of time. Let this universe die.
Get Organized with The Home Edit,Let this show die. Dear God.
Get Organized with The Home Edit,I just want a supernatural esque monster of the week show
Get Organized with The Home Edit,Still waiting on that Crowley spin-off.
Get Organized with The Home Edit,"The SCU started 3 years before 'Iron Man', so checkmate, Marvel!"
Get Organized with The Home Edit,So they are making a spin off of Supernatural with the title Winchesters and then they want to you the Winchesters as a tent pole for spinoff/universe creation? Why notated Supernatural the tent pole? It only had like 20+ season's
Get Organized with The Home Edit,I read this as “Daniel Ackles” and got so excited that he had a brother that is also very hot 😭
Get Organized with The Home Edit,I originally read this as The Walkers and thought it was an old western version of the Texas Rangers with a young Walker as a new Ranger. I dunno... that might be more fun.
Get Organized with The Home Edit,love Jensen but he should really hire someone to buy suits for him. Texans alright
Get Organized with The Home Edit,If they were going to do a prequel I wanted Bobby and Rufus. I'll still give this a shot though.
Get Organized with The Home Edit,Finally - I've been wondering about this! Can't wait to see what else they have in the works.
Get Organized with The Home Edit,Danneel punching above her weight. bravo.
Get Organized with The Home Edit,"Okay, but their parody of Paul Simon’s You Can Call Me All is one of the funniest and well done things I’ve ever seen."
Get Organized with The Home Edit,"I don’t see the point. Supernatural is done to death. I was done with it by Season 7. Granted, it had it’s moments after Season 5 finale but that was ultimately because of characters rather than plot. Crowley and Castiel kept me interested for some of it. A prequel with none of the favourite characters or interesting monsters makes no sense."
Get Organized with The Home Edit,The Yellow Eyed Demon was pretty powerful in the hierarchy of hell. He wasnt just a regular ol demon.
Get Organized with The Home Edit,"I like s1 bc most of ep just tell about hunting urban legend, such wendigo, house of horror, womam in white, bloody mary.

We need show just simple like that, not about war with demon and angel"
Get Organized with The Home Edit,I am just going to watch it like it's a different show. I imagine it's just a monter hunter shot as a  modern western and I am here for it.
Get Organized with The Home Edit,Sucks that this may get made but they scrapped Wayward Sisters. It had some characters that were like mainly Sheriff Jody Mills and her adopted daughter who was in 1-2 episodes iirc.
Get Organized with The Home Edit,"They basically over used dues ex weapons in 6-15. Angel Blades, The Colt. Time Travel. Basically the writers would just forget how to make somebody a credible threat towards the end of the season.

Lucifer even got downgraded to being a joke. If you watched Season 5, Lucifer was basically  scary (to a point), and a nonstop threat that the brothers had no way of stopping him. They also did the same with Gabriel. His end, and then he was brought back like 3x thus making his sacrifice completely pointless."
Get Organized with The Home Edit,">We're supposed to go back to a time when a single demon was like a season boss?

Yes."
Get Organized with The Home Edit,I liked the characters and their chemistry so much I pushed through the literal garbage tv.  Without them there’s no reason to bother.
Get Organized with The Home Edit,I think he likes the money.
Get Organized with The Home Edit,"What else would you have him do? He showed up in The Boys and another show, he’s done voicework for DC animated movies, he has these shows, he owns a brewery, and he has three relatively young kids."
Get Organized with The Home Edit,Yes! Listen to random Redditor #238! He knows how to make you successful! /s
Get Organized with The Home Edit,"Except for Walker. Apparently the show is cheap to make so people at Nextstar might keep it.

But yeah if I was an actor on a CW show
I would be looking to book my next gig right about now."
Get Organized with The Home Edit,They tried. CW didn't pick up any of the pilots.
Get Organized with The Home Edit,"Supernatural lived for ten years after it's expiration date because people loved the leads.  They tried twice(?) to make spinoffs while the show was running but neither of them stuck because people don't care that much about the world or people who aren't Sam, Dean and Castiel.

Even this I doubt is gonna work.  John and Mary weren't that popular to begin with, let alone AU/enormously retconned versions of them, which is why practically every article about this show is about Jensen Ackles rather than the show itself."
Get Organized with The Home Edit,I am pissed Wayward Sisters (Spin off with Sheriff Jody Mills) never got made. It had my interest.
Get Organized with The Home Edit,"LOL, he does have a brother that is also attractive!"
Get Organized with The Home Edit,The Walker prequel premiered last week.
Get Organized with The Home Edit,She knows how to get what she wants. It’s called being a manipulative narcissist. She ain’t special.
Get Organized with The Home Edit,"I get that, but even his minions required a ton of prep-work before fighting.  Once they introduced Angel Swords, the First Sword, The Colt, they just became as dangerous as the random mooks in a John Wick movie."
Get Organized with The Home Edit,"I got drawn in by monster of the week, i slogged through things like jack and the leviathans because I loved the brothers"
Get Organized with The Home Edit,I want him to hang dong in an HBO show.
Get Organized with The Home Edit,Yeah…if they keep any show it will be Walker. It is the networks top rated scripted show. The rest are toast.
Get Organized with The Home Edit,"I'm talking out my butt here, but it occurs to me that Walker might do well with older demos so it might be okay? Isn't Nexstar trying to go for older people who still watch network or something?"
Get Organized with The Home Edit,"Reminds me of people who say someone should make a new show in the Firefly universe. How many people actually watched Firefly for the 'Verse? I like world building more than the average person, but I was 100% watching Firefly for the characters because the 'Verse isn't particularly compelling.

I'd watch those characters in any fictional universe. A new show in the 'Verse would be a crap shoot on whether or not I liked the new leads."
Get Organized with The Home Edit,Me too
Get Organized with The Home Edit,"Yeah they hand waved it in later seasons.  The writers ""just kinda forgot"" that most of the stronger demons all had telekinesis and could just paralyze people."
Get Organized with The Home Edit,Oh they making a Thunder Gun series over there?
Get Organized with The Home Edit,"Power creep.  Same thing happened in Buffy The Vampire Slayer too.  Season one vampires were a real threat, but by the time Buffy is fighting literal gods towards the end a regular ol' vamp is just cannon fodder."
Get Organized with The Home Edit,"Too be fair they did run into a few of those over the years. They were just mostly dead or locked away by the later systems.

There's one released from a prison box in a season 14 episode who fucking wrecks them all instantly when he is freed."
Get Organized with The Home Edit,Didn't they tattoo/brand themselves so that they couldn't be controlled/paralyzed/telekinesis-sized?
Get Organized with The Home Edit,"Exactly power creep, yes.

Supernatural is live-action redneck Dragon Ball Z."
Get Organized with The Home Edit,The tattoo made it so they couldn't be possessed by demons.
Get Organized with The Home Edit,">Supernatural is live-action redneck Dragon Ball Z.

I'm never going to be able to unsee this."
Get Organized with The Home Edit,"Ah ok. Haven't watched in years, didn't quite remember what it was for"
Get Organized with The Home Edit,"Honestly, it was originally part of the charm for me once that clicked. Then it went completely off the rails (much like Dragon Ball Z)."

Get Organized with The Home Edit,"A) I wonder why this is only seasons 1-3?  Are they not able to bring the Netflix seasons somewhere else?

B) OTOH, how much will people really miss the revival seasons?"
Get Organized with The Home Edit,It seems like Disney is just going to do what the rest of us do and pretend seasons four and five don't exist.
Get Organized with The Home Edit,"I mean, it’s one banana, Michael. What could it cost? $10?"
Get Organized with The Home Edit,Wonder if they’ll act like the next two don’t exist and they’ll just not be available anywhere
Get Organized with The Home Edit,"Makes sense, it was on FOX originally and we get all the Fox shows on Disney in the uk under Star. I guess it’ll go to Hulu in the US?"
Get Organized with The Home Edit,Losing Netflix's seasons is not a huge loss tbh. I've seen them once and only because I loved the original seasons.

Get Organized with The Home Edit,God I hate streaming services. It really is the new cable TV.
Get Organized with The Home Edit,"- A streamer advertises that your favourite show is on their service. So you pay them money to watch that show.
- Later they decide that money isn't good enough and your favourite show disappears off that service.
- It reappears on another streamer's service and now you have to pay money to them as well.

= Piracy."

Get Organized with The Home Edit,I’ll miss the revival just for some of the jokes honestly. Not a lot… but some.
Get Organized with The Home Edit,A similar thing happened with the Defenders Saga. They all went up but in 1080p. They wanted to take time to get the conversions right.

Get Organized with The Home Edit,"The series was on-demand on Netflix for *a decade*. 

In the cable tv era, it would at best be having reruns on a niche comedy station at a weird time in the afternoon and bounced stations a bunch of times as the licensed get passed around."
Get Organized with The Home Edit,Take a hike
Get Organized with The Home Edit,Not that I disagree but Netflix is a monthly service and they typically give notice of things leaving at the end of the month. So you can always just cancel -- you aren't forced to keep paying after your favorite show disappears.
Get Organized with The Home Edit,Or in reality they didn’t own the rights to the show Disney does and they took the rights back when the contract expired
Get Organized with The Home Edit,"To be fair, you're essentially describing renting. You don't have to pay money to them *as well*, you're paying to rent the current library of releases - you can just cancel your Netflix subscription."
Get Organized with The Home Edit,At any moment you can cancel your subscription if you no longer want to keep it. You’re not a victim.
Get Organized with The Home Edit,I paid to stream something once so I should never have to pay again!
Get Organized with The Home Edit,Wow you really go for the jugular.
Get Organized with The Home Edit,Beads?!?!
Get Organized with The Home Edit,"I'm pretty sure the entire ff subplot was written to get the joke ""daddy's got to get his rocks off"""
Get Organized with The Home Edit,ANUSTART gets me every time
Get Organized with The Home Edit,The original cut of season 4 is pretty inspired and great. The recut and season 5 on the other hand are borderline unwatchable imo
Strangled,"SVU's most recent episode had Ice T referencing ""his old partner"" a few times. Said he went back to Baltimore after he retired. Great character."
Strangled,"Doesn't he hold the record for the same character being in the most shows? NYPD blue, law and order x 3, and wasn't there a Simpsons with him too?"
Strangled,RIP tremendous actor. Always made whatever he was in better.
Strangled,To think Munch was referenced heavily in this past weeks episode of SVU. And with high esteem.  Seems very fitting.
Strangled,"Is there any actor as famous for portraying the same character in so much *unrelated* media?

Richard Belzer played a Detective John Munch in *Homicide: Life on the Street, 30 Rock, The Wire, The X-Files, Law & Order, Arrested Development, Unbreakable Kimmdy Schmidt* and [so much more.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Munch)

Fun fact he's one of two characters based on Jay Landsman in *The Wire*, the real cop who showrunner David Simon worked closely with. There's John Munch based on Jay Landsman, the character Jay Landsman based on Jay Landsman, but also the real Jay Landsman is in The Wire as a cop named Dennis Mello lol."
Strangled,I've been watching old SVU a lot recently. Always loved it when Belzer would pop up on screen. Bring Homicide to streaming!!!!!
Strangled,"I'm an old timer and I remember when he was choked out by Hulk Hogan, hit the floor and split his head open on his own talk show. He sued Hogan and won."
Strangled,"Godfather of the original MCU - the Munch Cinematic Universe, albeit contained almost exclusively to television."
Strangled,"Another reminder that Homicide: Life on the Street is the best show not available on streaming or digital format. Before SVU Munch partnered with Ned Beatty’s character Stanley Bolander. 

Loved Munch’s encounter with the Lone Gunmen in X-Files."
Strangled,The comedian in Scarface!
Strangled,Homicide: Life On The Street still gets no respect.
Strangled,"Aw man, I loved the Belz. Underappreciated as a comic due to his success in dramatic roles. Really funny."
Strangled,Rest in Peace Belzer. The last episode of SVU had Ice T mentioning his character quite a bit.
Strangled,"Aw, man. Munch was my favorite, not least because of his ability to magically exist in every televisual universe simultaneously. May his memory be a blessing, in every single one of them."
Strangled,"“I've known Chevy Chase for so long, I actually knew him when he was funny!”

Richard Belzer"
Strangled,The glue that held the St Elsewhere connected universe together. RIP to a legend
Strangled,Finn and Munch are the GOAT TV cop duo. Better chemistry than Benson/Stabler. RIP to the legend.
Strangled,"Jagger Off!!

https://youtu.be/dKBo-glyYSw"
Strangled,RIP Munch.
Strangled,"Once in awhile, a celebrity death hits hard, and you’re not sure why. 

This is one of those.  

RIP"
Strangled,"RIP Munch, absolute legend

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_5NtaqONbU&list=PLAc63Rzp8QKThusgjqJGzguXK0D6vwFpC&index=8"
Strangled,"rest in peace to an absolute legend, munch was my favorite character in law and order"
Strangled,"Oh man, Belzer was one of my favorites.  I read his comedy conspiracy theory book multiple times in high school and legit loved his on screen chemistry working on SVU, not to mention Homicide and his various extra appearances as Detective Munch.  RIP sir."
Strangled,"RIP

I remember seeing him years ago in a bizarre 1970s comedy called “The Groove Tube”. I checked and it was his first movie role. He was also in Ron Howard’s “Night Shift” with Henry Winkler and Michael Keaton."
Strangled,He was the coolest guy in NY in his stand up hayday in the late 70s early 80s
Strangled,Damn. With all the talk about Munch in the last svu episode I was kind of hopeful that he’d have a guest spot. Dude played the hell out of that character.
Strangled,Nice tribute from Baltimore…. https://www.thebaltimorebanner.com/opinion/column/richard-belzer-homicide-life-on-the-street-law-order-special-victims-unit-death-VYJG57FHVNF4ZOW7OWMSF56E7I/
Strangled,"He was the crossover personified. As Detective Munch, he tread between continuities on television like it was nothing at all, first showing up on Homicide: Life on the Streets, then Law and Order, then Sesame Street. He was the glue that bound continuities together, and without him to provide that stability, I dread to think of what might happens to the Multiverse."
Strangled,"Never forget when Richard Belzner was choked out by Hulk Hogan on air, passed out and split his head from falling on the ground. Ended up suing Hulk Hogan for $5mil and settled out of court. Used the money to buy an estate in France which he named “Chez Hogan”. Legend."
Strangled,I really thought he’d be around for another decade. RIP.
Strangled,Now Munch and Lenny can sit around and crack jokes about each other and their exes uninterrupted. RIP
Strangled,"Fun fact: Because of Richard Belzer’s character John Munch making appearances or mentioned in other shows that would mean that Homicide: Life on the Street, the Law & Order series, the Chicago series, The X Files, Arrested Development, The Wire, Luther, and… Sesame Street would all exist in the same universe."
Strangled,"Munch , no! 
RIP 
Good night Sweet Prince."
Strangled,"Hogan did it, he finally killed him."
Strangled,"Man, that sucks. The Belz will be missed."
Strangled,MUNCH!
Strangled,Richard was always a welcome presence. Thanks for all the entertainment over the years
Strangled,"It was reported that his last words are, and I quote: “Fuck you, motherfucker.” Beautiful."
Strangled,"He never struck me as old because he also had that middle age ""been there, seen that, too cool for everything"" energy. Never thought about him getting up there age. I didn't realize he was in his late seventies. 

Him as Munch was the best. No matter where he showed up, he was always a highlight."
Strangled,"In his honor I’m going down to the docks tomorrow to ask every dockworker if they know what happened to Richard Belzer. Anything at all that could help me. 

I’ll leave them a card in case they think of anything."
Strangled,Did Hulk Hogan do it?
Strangled,It's crazy Munch got name checked for the first time in years in this week's episode of SVU. Rest in peace to a legend.
Strangled,Damn not my man’s Munch. Rest in peace
Strangled,"He was always the best scrapbook professor, RIP"
Strangled,"Some of yhe most raw, hysterical standup ever. RIP"
Strangled,PSA: apparently his last words were “fuck you motherfuckers”
Strangled,Rip. Great actor.
Strangled,"I knew him from Homicide. I didn't know he was a comedian. Saw him on 'the green room' and really liked his appearance. 

https://youtu.be/UXqmTgQy1YU"
Strangled,RIP.  I loved watching him over the years.
Strangled,"So this is how the Munchivsrse ends.  Rest well, detective."
Strangled,Fuck!  The Belz?  NO!
Strangled,Noooo. He was so great as Munch.
Strangled,RIP to a legend
Strangled,"Last weeks episode had so many mentions of him after nothing for how long. Seemed like a build up to a guest appearance, so sad."
Strangled,That’s too bad. Loved Munch and Tutuola. SVU wasn’t the same after he left and that duo got broken up.
Strangled,Nooooo! I love Munch!!! I am always talking about how funny he is. RIP
Strangled,Obscure trivia… Belzer was morning radio host in the early 70’s.  He co-hosted on WNBC in NYC with Scottie Brink until Imus came back from Cleveland in ‘77.   https://books.google.com/books?id=aNECAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA33&lpg=PA33&dq=brink+and+belzer&source=bl&ots=ldWkLGmhgt&sig=ACfU3U0hW-CqLKZnJYoRGmGJcThshFjSCw&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiko4__h6P9AhXslmoFHZFECDAQ6AF6BAg9EAI#v=onepage&q=brink%20and%20belzer&f=false
Strangled,"Fuck, :/. When I still lived at home my mom and I would watch SVU almost everyday. 78 is definitely getting up there but you never really think they’re gonna pass until they do.

I fear Ian McKellan could go any time now and it wouldn’t be all that early given his age as well.

Condolences to his family, dude is a legend."
Strangled,rest in peace man❤️❤️❤️ youre well loved
Strangled,"That’s all we get usually, 78 is a good life. It’s hard to believe we only get that many years here.

I took me 35 to feel like I’m prepared and in a good place. I can’t believe I only have 41 left."
Strangled,I used to see him on the upper west side walking his dogs back in the day. True and true new yorker.
Strangled,"I was recently thinking about him, wondering how his retirement was going and hoping he was enjoying it. R.I.P munch. May your conspiracies live forever"
Strangled,"He shouldn’t have made all those God jokes on Evening at the Improv in the 80s !

EDIT: why the downvotes? That was his signature bit in the 80s; telling a joke about God and then clenching his chest as if God just have him a heart attack in response."
Strangled,RIP. My favorite character on SVU
Strangled,You’ll be missed. Made everything a little more intriguing
Strangled,"He will be deeply missed, the world has lost another great soul"
Strangled,"Hulk Hogan finally finished the job, eh?"
Strangled,RIP another one of favs gone. Thanks for the laughs.
Strangled,Isn’t he the guy Hulk Hogan choked out and dropped on the floor?
Strangled,"One time, in the mid-90's I was on MDMA and buying clove cigarettes in a bodega in NYC and I said to the man in front of me, ""nice jacket!"" because it had gold epilates and it was Richard Belzer.  So, yeah..."
Strangled,I grew up watching Homicide life on the street.
Strangled,So great on Stern
Strangled,rip he was amazing :’)
Strangled,"The cornerstone of the multiverse, RIP legend."
Strangled,"Sarcasm and quips, great actor. Sad, rest easy."
Strangled,Didn't know he was a comedian.
Strangled,"Feels bad man. Loved this guy on SVU, and seems like he was a pretty cool guy off-set as well. Absolute Chad last words too"
Strangled,Never knew he was a comedian.
Strangled,"Rest in Peace, Richard. Only knew him from the wrestling issue, but seems to be that he wad a great actor on SVU, so have to check that out. 

R.I.P."
Strangled,"Goodbye, Munch! Rest in peace."
Strangled,And Munch was just mentioned on SVU Thursday night as having gone back to Baltimore and reporting The Waterfront bar.
Strangled,RIP. Loved the Belz!
Strangled,I first saw him on late night HBO stand-up.  Soooo funny.  I stopped watching SVU when he left.
Strangled,Man was absolute legend rip
Strangled,"I will always remember him first for *""The Wrong Guys""*. Fun little movie. Belzer was one of a pack of grown up Cub Scouts; which also included Louie Anderson and Richard Lewis. They all head back to a failed pack site to try and finish it as adults. They get mistaken gor the FBI by escaped convicts; which incide John Goodman (Duke Earl) and Ernie Hudson. Their childhood bullies show up to. Silly, but fun. And gave one of the most memorable lines that i actually got to bust out in the appropriate moment a few weeks back. I feel the only other person who has seen this other than me is one of my sisters."
Strangled,"RIP Richard Belzer.

I wrote a book a few years ago, a neo-noir story set in a close future NYC. In the last chapter, you have these two detectives piecing the puzzle together about the main character misdeeds, and I actually had Munch/Richard Belzer in mind.

The other one? Clark Johnson, of course. I loved the funny but clever vibe in Homicide. Belzer was great, one of the best deadpan comedians I might say."
Strangled,For some reason I thought he was already gone
Strangled,"He was a B, for suing the Hulkster."
Strangled,:( I initially thought it was Keith Richards... whew...
Strangled,"I met him walking down 72nd street and Broadway some years ago. He was chatting with someone walking their dog, and I waved and nodded as I walked past. He stopped for a sec and turned to me and and lit up with a big smile “Heyy, how are ya!” 

A chill and talented guy."
Strangled,[deleted]
Strangled,It was Myron’s Hydrocillator.
Strangled,Awww I loved him
Strangled,Loved his work.
Strangled,My first time seeing him was in Scarface as the emcee of the comedy show right where Tony is almost killed.
Strangled,"RIP Belzer, He will be Miss

one thing I wish is that they didn't diminished his role in the later seasons of SVU"
Strangled,did he die of natural causes?
Strangled,R.I.P.🙏🏽🙏🏽❤️❤️
Strangled,oh no man... the tv greats are dropping like flies now
Strangled,This just makes me sad.
Dead End,Didn’t even know this existed
Dead End,"To me, the most baffling part of all of this, and there are many baffling parts, is that I remember that Netflix at some point admitted that the vast majority of their users were just binge watching stuff like Friends or Grey's Anatomy.  You would think that would scare them as more and more classic licensed material gets pulled to go to alternate streaming services. What's going to happen to their userbase if 10 years from now their library is almost exclusively made up of unfinished shows, most ending on a cliffhanger?"
Dead End,"Man, Netflix’s promotional team is just non existent for anything that isn’t a guaranteed massive hit huh?"
Dead End,Because it was doing better than oddballs
Dead End,"Netflix? Cancellation? Two seasons? Animated show? 

Yep, that’s a bingo."
Dead End,Netflix just gets stressed out if they haven't canceled something in the last couple of hours.
Dead End,I like adult animation and I’ve never heard of this??
Dead End,I feel bad for my kids.  They really liked this one.
Dead End,I’ve watched other animated shows and this has never once shown up anywhere on my Netflix homepage. No idea about its quality but I bet most people just didn’t know it existed.
Dead End,Thats a shame. It was a fun show but hit on some heavy topics. Would have been nice if they had a chance to wrap up the stories
Dead End,"I love the paranormal, and I love amusement parks. I have never seen this even advertised to me on Netflix. This actually makes me feel anger, I would have watched this, this isn't even the shows fault. So many people in this comment section haven't heard of this either. WTF."
Dead End,Netflix should rebrand as a streamer for limited series; hardly any shows make it to a third season
Dead End,"Netflix: Is your show called Wednesday?

Showrunner: No?

Netflix: Oh, is it called Stranger Things then?

Showrunner: No, it's called...

Netflix: You're canceled!"
Dead End,Too many shows nobody knows about. Weekly release Netflix. You're losing too many American creatives
Dead End,"This is so sad! Such a great show, tackling hard topics like friendships evolving and the first time I've seen a Trans gay male lead. 

Barney was such a great character and so wholesome for today's children's shows. He was a kind person who just loved so much. I feel a little like I've lost a friend. 

Norma Khan was the first time I've seen my own story of realizing what Bisexual is and the excitement to finally understand what you've been feeling. 

I'm in tears, this show was so incredible. 
I'll deeply miss it. Thank you Hamish Steele for two amazing seasons, I'll always wish it was more."
Dead End,"Damnit, I really enjoyed this one, what a bummer."
Dead End,"Sigh…

It was fun while it lasted I guess."
Dead End,I didn’t watch the show but damn that art style is obnoxious.
Dead End,Ugh this show was such a a gem too. I was looking forward to more.
Dead End,"All these cancellations are why I just don't watch any shows until they're finished/on final season, with a proper ending and not cancelled on a cliffhanger."
Dead End,"It was decent, not great but still wholesome."
Dead End,"I saw it, it was ok. More pissed about inside job"
Dead End,I wish I didn't learn of this show's existence from its cancellation notice
Dead End,Never heard of it and it wasn't recommended to me on Netflix once.
Dead End,"Nah man, if Netflix is going to keep doing this bullshit they need to change their business model. Like becoming the place people premier the first season of their show and then at the end of the season Netflix sells the show rights to the highest bidder and even directs viewers to that service."
Dead End,"Huh, at least the title is accurate"
Dead End,">The series was praised for its representation of LGBTQ characters and held a 100% RottenTomatoes score. The show also led to an open letter from five Republican senators to the TV Parental Guidelines Monitoring Board over “disturbing” LGBTQ+ content.

You think this run forever just to spite its critics."
Dead End,Just say Netflix beside any title and we will assume it means cancelled.
Dead End,Make a list of what isn't cancelled at Netflix. It'll be much shorter.
Dead End,Think I read somewhere that Netflix stopped giving any fuck about animation. Seem to be true.
Dead End,People will be angry about this but I doubt those people even watched it. Although to be fair Netflix do a terrible job on promotion. Things just shadow drop into the depths of the menu screen and they expect it to do well.
Dead End,"What I find interesting is that all of these shows that are being cancelled I had never heard of until they were no more.

Maybe that is Netflix’s problem - they don’t believe in their content enough to promote it. instead they just expect us to just watch whatever comes up on the front page and when we don’t then its off to the Glue factory."
Dead End,I wanted to like this but got kind of bored
Dead End,Drop off is real. I remember Netflix shoving this in my face. My wife and I (28 & 29) got 5-10 into pilot and stopped watching.
Dead End,"Well that’s unfortunate, I thought it was a good show."
Dead End,Oh look people mad Netflix canceled a show nobody was watching besides the few people in the comments I’m shocked. It has only 2.3k votes and 6.9 rating on IMDb. Tired of all the complaining I see on here every time Netflix cancels a show that wasn’t performing well.
Dead End,Still can't believe they cancelled Inside Job after renewing it. It was so good and the ending was so sad ;(
Dead End,"""Netflix cancels show you've never heard of"" is so rote at this point you might as well have a daily headline reading ""Sun rose this morning.""

I just assume that Netflix has two massive bingo-ball machines running at all times. Every morning, one randomly greenlights something and the other randomly cancels something. And at no point does anything from the greenlight machine ever receive so much as a quantum of marketing budget or attention."
Dead End,"Art looks like standard CalArts style garbage.  No loss.

Companies like Netflix keep shoveling stacks of cash into the furnace of woke programming that appeals to 1% of Twitter who still won’t watch or pay for it.

Velma’s next for early cancellation despite the fact that any sane executive would have known from the start no one would watch it either."
Dead End,Netflix is not the place to watch series.
Dead End,I watched the first episode and am very surprised it got a second season.
Dead End,"I thought this show was surprisingly boring. It wasn’t especially funny, nor was it interesting enough to make some of its heavier themes/topics land. I also think stylistically it feels dated to the early 2010’s in a way that we’ve moved past since."
Dead End,Nooooo! We love this show in my house!!! I don't know if the comics have gone further though.
Dead End,more news: infinitesimally small niche group of fans of minor content are mad at netflix and are sure the c suite doesn't know how to run a business
Dead End,Weak character design
Dead End,"This one hurts. I adored this show, and its queer representation was ground-breaking."
Dead End,"One of these days, most likely some years down the road, we're gonna be watching ""Cancelled: The Fall of Netflix"""
Dead End,"Not really a surprise, I watched one episode and it was garbage."
Dead End,"So this was pretty big. One of the best shows Netflix put out, and it kinda popped off on Tiktok. Incredibly sad, especially with how season 2 ended."
Dead End,"I loved this show. Not only because of its main themes, but the low-key representation leading this series was really cool. This makes me really mad. Ugh, damnit. Part of me knew this show didn't have the popularity to keep it going though..."
Dead End,Strike three Netflix. I’m canceling my subscription
Dead End,I guess parents weren’t in a rush to show their kids all that “diversity.” Shit doesn’t sell.
Dead End,My 4-year-old niece will be very disappointed.
Dead End,"Good, the trailer was bafflingly boring"
Dead End,Nooooo
Dead End,I loved this show.
Dead End,"Aww, I liked this one."
Dead End,Noooooooooooooooossss
Dead End,"Netflix doesn't show me stuff like this - they're tracking what I watch to the point that I pretty much just get a few genres but no real choice. If I switch to Guest (or Hell, even my kids' account!!) I notice there's things I'm missing. I even created a second profile but I find their recommendations converging with my original profile.

I miss the DVD days. Granted, I'd always have a DVD or 2 stuck on top of the TV for a few months, but you could legit rate things and prioritize your selections. Now everything has an Netflix logo attached and I dig around for something to watch.

So now I look forward to visiting my parents and surfing the cable channels."
Dead End,I for one am blaming all of  Netflix’s animation cancellations on their dumb two part season bullshit because they release the first part of the season let it rot for a year and then when part 2 releases with little to no advertising they cancel it a short bit later and wonder why people are forgetting these shows.
Dead End,Netflix really need to get someone in who looks over the stuff being created lmao.
Dead End,"At this point, whenever I see a series cancelled, I just assume it’s at Netflix."
Dead End,God damn it Netflix! What the fuck?!
Dead End,"Has netflix ever thought about spending more than a couple knickles they found in the couch on marketing for their shows? 

Maybe they could avoid cancelling all these shows if people knew they existed in the first place and gave them a chance. 

Who am i kidding netflix doesn’t make smart choices"
Dead End,[deleted]
Dead End,"Tl;dr this thread: Netflix hate circle jerk

Like all you people are doing nothing but watching shows for 8 year olds and are mad you didn't see this one."
Dead End,It really feels like so shows lately start off in a form where I should be in the main demographic for them in they make a bunch of dumb creative decisions that make me have zero interest in it. I usually just chalk it up to the show being made for a different demographic than mine but like…..I’m a young dude who doesn’t want culture war stuff in my shows and wants to watch a lot of tv and can pay for it…..you’d think at some point it would make sense to cater to my demographic at least a little. I’m begging y’all to take my money.
Dead End,Literally never knew this show existed
Dead End,"Twice in a week I'm learning about Netflix animated shows because they've been canceled. 

Yet, here's the rub: I am subbed to both r/television and  r/Netflix yet I never saw a single post about any of them. Which goes to prove Netflix's decision to axe them when they didn't even get any buzz among the very audience they were intended for."
Dead End,Thought about checking it out.
Dead End,"Damnit Netflix, I liked this one
┻━┻ ︵ヽ(`Д´)ﾉ︵ ┻━┻"
Dead End,"Fuck Netflix. So sick and tired of them doing one or two seasons of a thing, and then canceling it before a story can end… Canceling my subscription"
Dead End,"At this rate, the news will be ""___ does NOT cancel ____"""
Dead End,Smh cancel culture strikes again
Dead End,I have never even heard of this. I have 2 kids that watch cartoons on Netflix. How did this not come up?
Dead End,"Fuckin hell, man"
Dead End,"Honest question, how am I supposed to get invested in ANY Netflix show from the beginning at this point?"
Dead End,Ugh… and just when I was starting the 2nd season today. *And* crossing my fingers after Inside Job.
Dead End,"Loved this show so much, so cute and personal with its topics. Guess it's time to pre-order the two comics"
Dead End,"Again, I look forward to when creators avoid Netflix like the plague knowing well that they’ll get cancelled if their stuff doesn’t break records from day one"
Dead End,"I’m genuinely very worried about the future of animation in the West.

Disney

Netflix

Especially Warner Bros

Everywhere you look, it’s going to shit.

At least Japan knows the value"
Dead End,Never heard of this show
Dead End,\*sigh\* ofc it was
Dead End,Great
Dead End,"Netflix's standards for what qualifies as a success are, simply put, unrealistic."
Dead End,Oh ffs
Dead End,Never even heard of this.
Dead End,It’s annoying. This was a good show
Dead End,Never heard of it.
Dead End,It isn’t terrible tbh. Just a snooze fest from time to time.
Dead End,WTF NETFLIX! This was such a good show and it ended on a cliffhanger that I really wanted to see how the story continued. I thought this show had a pretty decent fanbase. Netflix seems to be on a canceling animated shows spree. I’ve been disappointed in so many companies canceling or shorting a show. I guess one good silver lining is that I can get the comic books of this but idk if the show was going to stick to the same thing as the books
Dead End,"I used to be at least somewhat surprised by Netflix’s willingness to cancel shows, but then I remembered how many shows Adult Swim could green light and axe in a given year."
Dead End,"Everyone: Netflix has to pick up at least a few long term shows. 
Netflix: No."
Dead End,It was ok but it was missing something. Characters were not very memorable. Looked like too many other cartoons too. Also may be bad timing with such an influx of new cartoons.
Dead End,"Well, at least Netflix attempted to give it a chance."
Dead End,Noooo I loved this show! Norma reminded me of myself when I was younger :(
Dead End,Great show! I'm happy it got two seasons. A third would have been grand.
Dead End,My family real liked this show. I’m not happy about this.
Dead End,never heard of it till today.
Dead End,This had a second season?
Record of Youth,"I just binged this last night, very fucked up situation. The 3 episodes really take the audience on an emotional rollercoaster.

The documentary itself was really well made & I liked the subtle electronic soundtrack.

Idk if I'd agree that Larry is brilliant, I think he is just an asshole with an inherent knack for manipulating people by browbeating them into submission after lovebombing them. He's like an abusive partner, but more sociopathic."
Record of Youth,"It was a hard watch once it started to turn for the worst.

The fact that some of them weren't just intelligent but like top 1% intelligence is pretty insane.  Harvard and Columbia grad another Columbia grad. He turned their minds into mush.

Given his really unknown reason for having pretty legit political connections..not to mention his methodical brain washing and torture techniques..

Would not be surprised if he didn't at some point work at a CIA dark site or some shit.

Just find it hard to believe that he just
 naturally knew how to do that.. and that it would work. He obviously had done a job on his own daughter too. They didnt give much info on here so I done some research and yea.

The orchestration of it all.. getting so much money.. just reeks of some nefarious dark op in a third world country type shit


Also the fact he can't be analyzed. That is not natural."
Record of Youth,"Idk I think Isabella started changing her tune when she realized she was facing significant jail time. I don’t think she’s defending him as much these days. Her sentencing is on the 22nd. I think she plead guilty though, so she probably got a deal and will most likely get probation.

It was sad in the beginning when her and Felicia were both defending him really hard after he got arrested. You could see how broken and brainwashed they were."
Record of Youth,[deleted]
Record of Youth,Thank you for this recommendation!
Record of Youth,College coeds fall under the spell of the old man from Metallica’s “Enter Sandman” video.
Record of Youth,just watched it. what the actual fuuuuuck?! these poor people!
Record of Youth,Man that Felicia chick went from being a doctor to becoming a fucking lunatic. Very sad
Record of Youth,Larry most definitely was a Cia employee and he was high up in republican party. Which is why I feel when he got out of prison he felt so betrayed he tried to create an army to take down Bernie. The government needs to look into this guy ties to top republican officials
Record of Youth,"My takeaway from Larry is he is a good listener. 
He spent a majority of his ""sessions"" Just letting these ""forgotten"" Poor kids just talk to him. 

Then he would identify their insecurities, and core issues, and manipulate it. He would then allow their irrational brain to make up (coerced)fantasies and blame. 

Followed by love bombing and then taking it all back and blaming the victim cycle."
Record of Youth,Also believe that Bernie and Santos dad did know each other and Larry knew that. Back in the 80s Bish Sr. As head of cia and other Cia officials allowed cocaine into America for profit. Larry was likely a trained Cia intel officer and setup Santis dad to deal in new York under Bernies protection. Once he was arrested and Bernie failed to protect him he decided to to do all this as revenge. Betting even sending Talia to Santos to meet in first place. Classic Cia honey trap
Record of Youth,"He was also the most textbook perfect abusive partner to especially Felicia as well on top of it, when she explained their relationship in detail it really framed in my eyes how someone who was doing so incredibly well with her life ended up with all that. He was very all around an unreal sociopath"
Record of Youth,"That hits the nail on the head I don't think I could have described this man any better. I was really wondering how these students allowed this to happen. Watching the documentary you would have thought that this man had their families held hostage the way they were so agreeable. I just don't understand how the students didn't report this girl and her father the moment he started sleeping in their living room, I would have kicked this fat prick out of my dorm the moment he wanted to stay."
Record of Youth,"If you pay close attention, you'll see that out of the house of 7 students, he was only able to manipulate 3 - Isabella, Claudia, and Dan. (Santos was not a *clean* manipulation because of his desire to be connected to Talia.) So then we should focus on the shared characteristics of the people who fell under his spell. I'd argue that the ability to be manipulated has much more to do with a person's history of being forced to obey authority or give up agency. This is not an exceptional case - Larry is just an example of a person willing to use other people's weaknesses against them."
Record of Youth,"Only thing I thought was interesting in that scene after Larry has been a jail a bit, Isabella seemed more with it compared to Felicia, who honestly seemed like a dazed child. She didn't seem particularly out of it, just understandably worried her days of being Larry's little queen may have lead to a prison sentence."
Record of Youth,"I wonder if Isabella changed her tune and actually believes Larry is evil now, or is just putting on a show to get leniency."
Record of Youth,Anyone think it's interesting that Felicia faced no charges? Do you think she participated in the crimes and was granted immunity for testifying? Or do you think she did not participate in the crimes? The documentary didn't make it clear - they only showed bad acts by Isabella.
Record of Youth,thats the part that threw me !! they had such conviction about homeboy...
Record of Youth,This guy is way worse than any of those ppl.
Record of Youth,Success lies in the hands of those who want it.
Record of Youth,Yes! He def had ties to Giuliani and Trump (Larry was involved with Felix Sater and flew to Russia to deal with him). Sater was Donald Trump’s original conduit to Russia. Sooo much corruption.
Record of Youth,You sound like you're in Larryland
Record of Youth,"Where did this info come from?  You can’t just say things like this without some sort of verification. Santo’s dad was a CIA  backed cocaine dealer? C’mon. I seriously doubt that Larry was ever a CIA agent, there’s no way he would have been able to keep that quiet. He’s such a narcissist that he would have told everyone how important and special he was."
Record of Youth,"Relevant questions that the documentary didn't answer: 

1) what did the Rosario father do for a living? 

2) did the Rosario family have any documented contact with Kerik? (Felicia said yes but documentary didn't investigate)"
Record of Youth,"What about the idea that Felicia may have played a role of bamboozling the bamboozler??! I have a background in mental health and I know that anyone who has spent any time on a psychiatric ward has had their life threatened - IN PERSON - so the idea that Felicia, who completed multiple years of highly-competitive schooling and was in the 2nd (?) year of her residency psychologically broke in half and moved across the country after being threatened makes little sense to me. The speed of her brainwashing as well as how quickly she came out of it was also odd, as was the lack of evidence that she committed any crimes. Maybe the documentary just didn't show that footage, or maybe Felicia knew not to complete certain acts while under Larry's control? 

So yeah, Larry could've honeypotted Santos, but then Larry himself may have gotten honeypotted. Overestimated his abilities!

Sidenote: I found it super annoying that Felicia made claims about how easy it is to comprehensively manipulate a person's memory but provided no scientific or clinical evidence to back her claims. She is a highly educated professional so that was irresponsible of her and it was irresponsible of the documentary team to not fact-check her claims."
Record of Youth,He was her hunny bunny.
Record of Youth,This reminded me of the NXIVM Cult. I have no fucking clue how people can be so gullible. Lol.
Record of Youth,"You are absolutely right. This documentary was particularly interesting to me because I am of the same nationality as the three siblings (Dominicans). A big part of our culture consists on abuse (including physical) and respecting authority unconditionally. You can look it up, but around the 50s 60s ish the Dominican Republic had a brutal dictatorship. The Rosarios parents seem about my parents age and my parents grew up during this dictatorship. It impacted the culture in a way that Dominicans look up to authoritative people. I see it in my family, very intelligent people mostly comprised of accountants, doctors, nurses and lawyers and they have most fallen prey to some form of abuse or scam."
Record of Youth,"""Clean"" or not,.he was able to get Santos to defer any kind of critical thinking skills and to create a full dependence within just a few months. The relationship with the daughter was just an entry point just as much as depression or any other in thst Larry used."
Record of Youth,"According to my experience, Isabella is an accurate representation of what a traumatized person who identifies with her abuser looks like. The damage is on the inside, psychologically, and it's difficult to observe. 

Felicia acted more like a caricature of a traumatized person. All of her trauma is apparent in her behavior, her tone of voice, etc., but that is not the usual clinical presentation."
Record of Youth,The scariest part to me was knowing that she was a doctor and had other humans under her care at some point. Yikes.
Record of Youth,fair point
Record of Youth,"I’m not sure if it was a documentary on Hulu, or the one on Peacock about the same situation, but Felicia refused to take money from Claudia and didn’t wanna be a part of that even though she was aware that it was happening. Isabella, on the other hand was the bookkeeper. She would sometimes collect the money. She would also help launder the money, and she participated, or was at least present when Larry found out that Claudia was trying to escape his sex trafficking and tortured her. Larry and Isabella spent the night in Claudia’s hotel room while Claudio was strapped to a chair, repeatedly suffocated by having a plastic bag put over her head, beaten, dumped with cold water etc. in the audio clip, you can hear Isabella telling Claudia to stop being so dramatic and stop faking. During this night of torture, Larry and Isabella order food to be delivered to the room, sit down and eat, and then the torture begins again. It’s really sick and horrific and she definitely crossed the line into perpetrator. Felicia was not present for any of that."
Record of Youth,"What makes you say that? Keith Raniere harmed dozens of more people. He just came off as ""gentler."""
Record of Youth,"Read about Larry's background. You can definitely believe that there may be more to this story without siding in any way with Larry. He is absolutely a bad dude, but he had a lot of bad dude friends too."
Record of Youth,well played
Record of Youth,my biggest question is about Talia - wtf happened to her? she just brought him into their lives and dipped out?? how did we not get any follow up info
Record of Youth,"1. The nymag article explains they owned a travel agency and grocery store. 
2. Felicia was brainwashed just like others to say Kerik was involved. There is no proof of that."
Record of Youth,Did Felicia spend time in a psychiatric ward??
Record of Youth,Her giggling during that unnerved me greatly.
Record of Youth,"Ahhhhhh, makes sense!

Do you have any thoughts about Felicia saying that she met Kerik or that her family knew Kerik? Considering their family's history and that we don't know what the Rosario father did for a living, could that be true?"
Record of Youth,"Considering the suggestion that Felicia was completely under Larry's control and was sleeping in the same bed with him and Isabella, it seems strange to me that she would have the presence of mind to play no role in their primary method of making money? I also wonder how it could be possible that she wasn't involved in distributing drugs (e.g., adderall) to the group - including Claudia - considering her medical background?"
Record of Youth,He didnt use terrorist style torture tactics. Like pulling someone's tongue such pliers. Hitting them with hammers. All while force feeding adderall so they cant sleep for says until their minds turn to mush. I mean abuse is abuse sure.  Maybe it's because you actually see physical abuse in this documentary. The other group hid it a bit better.  All these manipulative bastards like to have cameras watching them tho. Scientologists keep theirs top secret. Kinda makes you wonder how bad it could get there.
Record of Youth,"Yeah, the left a lot out about Talia. For example, how did she and Isabella meet? Why did the documentary include a diagram that showed Talia sleeping in a bedroom with Isabella and her father? Was Talia involved in any encounters with Dan? I think the filmmakers said they didn't include info about her to protect her privacy - not sure why that same concern didn't apply to Claudia . . ."
Record of Youth,"Did Felicia say she was brainwashed into saying Kerik was involved? Because she was willing to say that Larry manipulated her memory involving her dress, but I don't remember her stating that she believes that Larry planted her memories of Kerik."
Record of Youth,"She was a psychiatry resident, I believe in her 2nd year. She should've been in psychiatric wards as well as other types of mental health facilities all the time. Since there was no indication that she was specializing in child psychiatry, then she would've been around adults with mental illness, which would've exposed her to all types of psychoses as well as personality disorders. A simple threat to one's life does not tend to shake anyone who has experience providing mental health care."
Record of Youth,"I don’t think it’s true. The Kerik thing was partly Larry’s obsession that Kerik was out to get him and also a reason to blame the parents. He needed to accuse the parents of something bad to keep the kids away from them and not trust them. 
I liked the documentary but I found it missing some information. The NYmag article explains: “They operated a small travel agency and a grocery store in Washington Heights and had saved enough to buy a home in the Bronx.”"
Record of Youth,Oh course their parents didn’t know him.
Record of Youth,"To be honest, I am unsure about that part, however, I’ve been reading more on this case and Larry overinflated small facts such as being in the army (he was only in the army 3 weeks. My guess is that he got people to harass Felicia and make her believe that."
Record of Youth,"She was under his influence, but in the documentary, she said that she had enough of herself still left to refuse that. There is also a recording which is played in one of the documentaries where Larry tells Isabella that Felicia is too weak to do what needs to be done, and Isabella offers to do it.  

Regarding the drugs, I was wondering if he was putting it in there food since he had locks on the refrigerators and told them that people were going to poison in their food so that’s why the locks were there  he basically controlled their meals and in the videos from wind Felicia is with him she’s extremely skinny, and when she gets out, she starts to gain weight back. so I wonder if he wasn’t solely responsible for slipping drugs into their food. I have no idea if that’s even possible. In the videos, she seems manic and not at all in control so I don’t know if she could have affectively distributed drugs, especially given her paranoia that she was being poisoned. 

It definitely seems like Felicia went off the deep end, but Isabella stayed very methodical throughout the situation. They responded differently to this horrible situation."
Record of Youth,"As far as I know, Keith Raniere did use many torture tactics - some practiced on dozens of people and others practiced on only 1-2. For example, Keith enforced sleep deprivation and calorie restriction on many members of NXIVM. I believe both of these practices have been used as torture tactics. He also carried out more extreme ones on specific people; for example, not letting a woman leave a small room for over a year, which I think could be considered to be solitary confinement as a form of torture. Keith also allegedly poisoned several of the women he was intimately involved with, which then developed into cancer. From a New York Post article -

“The deaths of Jeske and Cafritz, meanwhile, were attributed to cancer that developed after both women lived with Raniere in his Halfmoon, NY, home. Jeske died in 2014 at 63, Cafritz in 2016 at 57. Tests on another woman who spent time in the home and subsequently developed cancer revealed unusually elevated levels of ­bismuth and barium. Parlato believes they all had been ­poisoned. “Keith was handling their treatment. He was managing their diet. He was controlling the refrigerator,” Parlato alleged. Jason Kolowski, a forensic consultant interviewed for the documentary, said hair samples from the women revealed a “chronic ­exposure” to the heavy metals — and speculated that it may have come from rat poison.” 

I don’t know if these are technically “terrorist-style torture tactics” but it sure sounds like they could be, to me."
Record of Youth,So true! Also why did Talia leave the apartment? Did she cut contact with her dad? It’s also very interesting Talia was the one who found that dorm house for them. Did she do it knowing her dad was going to live with them once he got out of jail? Did her dad ask her to befriend these kids purposely? Was she dating Santos just to get him to follow her dad?
Record of Youth,"The thing to keep in mind with emotional abuse is that even the smartest person in the room can be taken down by a masterful manipulator, of which he was. His trend was that he seemed to prey upon those who had a lacking in their lives, he appealed to that need to be parented and cared for.   


He love bombed her in the beginning of their relationship and also he had connection with her younger siblings as well which I am sure they confirmed anything Larry said to her.   


She also mentions that during the time he was breaking her down she was exhausted with lack of sleep, this was a consistent tactic he used on all of them to break them down.   


Also keep in mind that this did not happen overnight, Larry was breaking these folks down over days, months, and years. He was really good at manipulating and making them all feel like he was their only source of help."
Record of Youth,She came out and said he manipulated her and planted untrue memories. The fact that she made up with her family implies she knows the Kerik thing didn’t happen. If she believed her parents were involved with Kerik why would she reunite with them? Why would she reunite with her siblings if she believed they poisoned her because kerik told them to. The whole thing is clearly a lie made up by Larry.
Record of Youth,Thank you for that context! I didn’t make that connection watching the Hulu doc. Starting the Peacock version now which has clarified different pieces of the story.
Record of Youth,"I think the fact that he's documented as only being involved in the military for 3 weeks is super interesting . . . that fact suggests that within 3 weeks he did something so disturbing as to be immediately discharged, or that within 3 weeks his involvement in the military was taken off public record."
Record of Youth,"So Felicia was manic, paranoid, went off the deep end, and believed what Larry told her, but she also felt comfortable saying no to him? And she had energy to bleach the floors and shovel dirt, but not go to Claudia's to pick up money?"
Record of Youth,"I knew of some of those situations..not all.

You don't normally see actual footage of it either ...which is why I probably overreacted a bit at the time.

Also since then with further research scientology is probably definitely the worst because of what they do to kids and families alone. With all the additional other stuff of the other 2 as well."
Record of Youth,"That's not how emotional abuse works - manipulation of this manner does not work on most people, even for a short amount of time. This is evidenced by the fact that Larry couldn't even manipulate most of the 19-year-olds living in the house. 

So you also didn't hear Felicia say that she suspects that Larry implanted the idea that she knew Kerik when she was younger?"
Record of Youth,You're welcome! I'll have to check out the Peacock doc too. I'm finding this whole thing so fascinating.
Record of Youth,"No. No one, other than Larry, knew Bernie Kerik. That’s what makes this story so batshit crazy. Why would Bernie Kerik conspire with nine year old Felicia’s parents to poison her and these other kids ten plus years in the future. The fact that some viewers couldn’t tell that the whole thing was made up by Larry is quite disturbing in its own right."
Record of Youth,"According to the documentary, yes. I mean I don’t know these people personally, I just watched two documentaries about the cult yesterday lol. It definitely seemed from the videos and recordings that Felicia was more unhinged and manic and Isabella was more methodical, calm and thus controllable. There were recordings where Larry would command Felicia to do something and she would scream “NO” and sprawl out on the floor- he broke her mentally for sure, but it seems like he broke her to the point that she literally couldn’t function. Her saying that she had enough of herself left to say no may just be how she recalls the situation."
Record of Youth,"I think Felicia as a victim grew to love Larry but she never changed her moral compass to be a bad person. Izzy on the other hand truly become his right hand person and in doing so, became evil herself."
Record of Youth,She said it was all lies. She clearly said that he implanted fake memories and lied to her. Why do you believe Kerik was involved? There’s zero proof.
Record of Youth,"I don’t know what your experiences are but that is how emotional abuse works. You find ways to love bomb the person and then you make them rely on you. If you watched the third episode, she talks about how he would break her down and she would panic, but he would also be the only one to build her up so she could only rely upon him. That is textbook emotional abuse. Also, she did talk about how the memories were implanted in her head. All of the kids talked about this. And there are others who were impacted and manipulated and emotionally/physically abused by him. Are you in support of what Larry did? Because it does feel that way"
Record of Youth,It really is fascinating. The Peacock doc introduces additional roommates/victims. 😓 And includes victim testimonies.
Record of Youth,"You're mixing multiple things together. The poisoning story is separate from the question of whether or not Kerik had any interaction with the Rosario family in the past. In the documentary, Felicia states that her family knew Kerik, and Felicia did not claim that Larry planted that idea (unless I missed a statement in the documentary that someone else can point out). 

Sorry to disturb you. Some of us are what they call ""active consumers"" and we get inquisitive when details don't line up. And just in case it's not clear - Larry is a bad dude regardless of whether Kerik knew the Rosario's. If Kerik did know the Rosario's though, it would make Santos' chance meeting with Talia a lot more interesting."
Record of Youth,"Felicia couldn't function and went along with all of Larry's insane ideas - including sharing a bed with Larry and Isabella and allowing her younger brother to hit himself every time she made a noise - but she knew not to collect money from Claudia? And if Larry broke Felicia to the point of not functioning, what allowed her to come out of it so quickly? And if Isabella maintained a better level of functioning, why did she not also come out of it quickly?  

In my experience, Isabella is what a traumatized person who identifies with her abuser looks like. The damage is done on the inside, psychologically, and is not readily observable in her behavior. Isabella appears methodical probably because that is part of her personality, and also because she sincerely believes that Larry is a trustworthy person who improved her life."
Record of Youth,"The documentary did a good job of showing her questioning some things, and not others as she was healing from this traumatic experience. It wasn’t an all at once thing where she decided everything he said was lies. It was a process."
Record of Youth,"A very important thing for people of all ages to understand is: you can ask questions about something that seems odd/ strange/ unpredictable to you without taking a stance about that thing's general qualities.

For example, you can question your country's president's decisions without making a statement about whether the president is an ""all-good"" or ""all-bad"" person. You can inquire about a friend's choices of behaviors in a given context if you think their explanation of their behavior doesn't add up - this doesn't mean you are making a general conclusion about your friend. You may watch your boss do something unfair to a coworker you don't like, and you can identify the boss' act as unfair while maintaining a dislike of your coworker. We all are capable of such complexity in thought - isn't it amazing??

It is ok to not believe everything you are told at face value, even stuff you are told on a really good, high-quality documentary. You can ask questions until you feel comfortable that you have the necessary information to draw a conclusion. It is also ok to realize that different people require different amounts of information before drawing a conclusion."
Record of Youth,Excellent.
Record of Youth,"Poisoning was connected as he once convinced F her parents poisoned him because of their connection to Kerik.

Can’t believe anyone would believe any of the families were connected to Kerik. And they just happened to later meet the guy obsessed with Kerik? Ok"
Record of Youth,"Human beings react differently to abuse. It seems like Isabella was his right hand person and stayed steady throughout. Felicia went off the deep end and maybe he couldn’t rely on her for stuff. It is interesting that Felicia wasn’t sentenced, it prob has to do with not being present when Isabella and Larry abused Claudia. Isabella also was the bookkeeper so clearly involved."
Record of Youth,She may not have cared about what happened to her but didn’t want to participate in literally torturing Claudia? What’s so hard about that to understand exactly?
Record of Youth,"This is all valid and true. I think my issue is is that it feels like you’re almost victim blaming these folks when in reality all we’re seeing is a documentary we are not seeing all of the information that happened to them in their situations. I also would strongly discouraged from saying that even someone with her schooling, and yours, would be immune to emotional and psychological manipulation and abuse. 

How these things manifest in peoples lives are going to be different. We can look at the information presented to us, but again, we don’t know the totality of it. I am more inclined to believe that she was able to be manipulated simply, because sometimes even those of us trained, let her guard down. It sounds like she let her guard down and the fact that he had had a history with the family probably also helped grease the wheels a little bit. He did do a lot of things that are textbook. We also saw in the documentary, the physical abuse that they encountered. 

As an aside, I do find it interesting that this seems to be the topic you were the most focused on. I’ve seen your user name pop up and a couple of different forms, but just solely about this. Is there a vested interest in this for you?"
Record of Youth,"I find it ironic that Felicia was so easy to be manipulated when she was still working at a hospital in LA despite that fact that she was studying to be a forensic psychiatrist, and all of Larry’s games were being played over the phone. The fact that she couldn’t recognize what he was doing tells me she picked the wrong area to specialize in."
Record of Youth,"Yes, I have a vested interest in making sure that people remain critical about the content that they take in, especially when the content is presented in a manner that results in the viewers sympathizing with a specific storyline. It should remain a rare occurrence that you walk away from any single piece of \*journalism\* with a feeling of certainty.

I also am committed to helping people remain vigilant about taking in scientific-sounding information when there is no accompanying scientific evidence. I find this especially egregious when it involves people who have the education to know better, as is the case with this documentary.

I feel the need to comment so much on this particular documentary because my background puts me in the position to understand the weaknesses in the documentary and I know most viewers do not have the same background. I'm playing my role pointing out things that are presented as ""true"" or ""fact"" and saying, ""what is the evidence behind that fact? Did they present the evidence? If not, then we should investigate whether that claim is accurate.""

The best quality documentaries reach the standard of investigative journalism. This documentary presents itself that way, but it did not meet the standard. People need to know how to think about that."
Record of Youth,"True, but the doc made a point of showing how she was in a grueling schedule and getting no sleep, etc. so very vulnerable. Plus she may have been drawn to this field since she had her own psychological issues to work through."
Record of Youth,"I think that’s just it. It is a documentary and we’re only seeing a slice of life with these particular participants. There was another story that came out last year about the same thing give a bit more background information. 

I think my reservations with some of your responses is that it seems as though you are unknowingly discrediting the victims, and potentially siding more with the perpetrator. When we have visual evidence, as well as corroborated stories from multiple people as to how he acts. What is there a potential for a gray area, yes, that could happen with any documentary. Would I go so far as to call what these victims have experienced as being incorrect no because again we are only getting a small portion of their life. I am inclined, based off of video and audio that was captured by Larry, to agree with the stories that they are telling.

I am not disagreeing that we shouldn’t be critical of the media that we consume, but I feel like with this particular situation there is enough evidence to corroborate to ascertain that the stories that the victims are telling are true. It does seem so wild to assume that someone like Larry could be as destructive, but again look at people like Manson , he had people believing him even after they had been arrested and even after they were put into prison. People can be that manipulative and people can be that destructive."
Record of Youth,"This is the scariest part of the entire documentary in my opinion. If a Harvard / Columbia psychiatry resident can be drawn in like that, I feel like it could happen to anybody."
Record of Youth,"Your reply illustrates the problem of not paying attention to the details. Have I ever suggested that Isabella's story was false in any manner? Or Santos' story? . . . No, I've only suggested that I found Felicia's story odd. My concerns are with Felicia's story as told by the documentary, and with the accompanying claims about memory manipulation. I, of course, do not know what the full true story is, but my education and clinical experience tell me that something about Felicia's story - as explained by the documentary - is strange.

At the very least, every viewer should understand that Felicia is a highly educated physician in training, and someone in her position should never make broad claims about memory manipulation without providing scientific evidence. Her choice to make those claims - and the documentary team's decision not to fact-check or speak with a single expert (and in fact they should've spoken with multiple experts) - was unscientific, unethical, and it implies broad consequences. Many people will walk away from the documentary believing that someone could comprehensively manipulate their memory within a short period of time - do you realize how problematic that is?"
Record of Youth,"I actually never said anything about you, saying that Isabella’s story was incorrect. From my responses, it was always from the viewpoint of how you viewed Felicia story. Another thing of note Felicia is and was trained as a psychiatrist. She mentioned several times in the documentary that she was doing her residency for psychiatry. So it would stand to reason that she would have some insight on what she’s talking about.

I also did a little bit more digging on my own, and found out that Felicia was studying to be a forensic psychiatrist. And one of the interviews she gave. She mentioned that she was under a great deal of stress with her residency, and that Larry would keep her up very very late into the night. She alludes to this in the documentary as well. Those two things alone can make someone, even the most highly educated, feel susceptible. She also mentioned that she knew of his relationship with her brother and sister, and how good they seem to be doing and she had met Talia and really liked Talia . So all of these things helped to keep her guard down even farther. She was being loved bombed and didn’t realize it and so if you add all of these things together, plus the gaslighting that she endured for about a decade it is not out of the ordinary for her to have been susceptible to what she was susceptible to.

Also, as far as your comment with cult experts, there are cult experts that are trained in psychiatry and psychology. And there is a Socioapathy for cult leaders, and how they target the people that they do wind up manipulating. I don’t know if what happened at Sarah Lawrence could truly be called a cult, but his actions were that of a narcissistic manipulator, who was able to manipulate multiple people at once. 

I don’t specifically know if the documentarians failed by not having experts to question peoples claims because it was more about hearing from these people and hearing their stories. If someone were that invested, it would be on them to do a bit more research, but all of the documented evidence is out there, and it was pretty well researched before it came out. as someone who is a big fan of the documentary genre, I didn’t see this is being unethical or problematic because they were just telling a story. I also did have the one advantage of watching another documentary that spoke a bit more about the facts of the case, and less about the victims retelling of stories. yes it was done in a very flashy way and we didn’t get 100% of every story but I think that’s just the nature of the genre in and of itself. We never fully gonna get the story from anyone participate because we weren’t there for their daily life."
Record of Youth,"Relatedly, people should be wary of input from so-called ""cult experts"" who have no research training or advanced education in our current understanding of memory. Anyone can call themselves a ""cult expert"" and make all sorts of claims - we should all demand that self-proclaimed experts provide scientific evidence to back up their claims.

For example, you may hear a cult expert say something like, ""anyone is susceptible to cult programming."" That's a big claim and it is a claim that is difficult to prove scientifically,. We should all learn to ask, ""can you explain the research studies that have demonstrated that anyone is susceptible?"" The person making the claim should be able to point to research studies that have used cult programming techniques on samples of people and found that the programming worked on all sorts of people with all sorts of personalities and background characteristics (the best case scenario would be a sample randomly drawn from a population). We should also all know that one study is never sufficient - replication is required in all fields of science, and more replication is better. Until you see that evidence, then you should withhold your conclusion about whether or not it is true that everyone is susceptible to cult programming. (This same reasoning also applies to the claim that anyone - especially any adult - is susceptible to control through emotional abuse.)"
Record of Youth,Sounds good.
Record of Youth,The filmmaker made a choice to tell the story through the lens of the victims’ experience. It’s a specific framework of storytelling. Not every documentary has to have experts and authorities weighing in. Another documentary on this topic can do that.
Record of Youth,Thank you! I personally appreciated this approach because it made it more impactful than experts talking about what happened to them

"Sister, Sister",*UPN intensifies*
"Sister, Sister","Seems like Netflix is targeting the ""make my kids watch this old stuff with me"" demographic."
"Sister, Sister","Sister Sister, YES!"
"Sister, Sister",Never knew how much I missed ya
"Sister, Sister",One on one used to be my shit. I could never get enough Kyla Pratt growing up.
"Sister, Sister",WE’RE THE PARKERSSSSS WE DOING OUR THING ITS A NEW TYPE OF SWING COME JOIN US
"Sister, Sister",Can we get Living Single? And Hangin w/ Mr Cooper?
"Sister, Sister","Adopted kid (now adult) here - loved LOVED LOVED Sister-Sister! Gave me hope I had a long lost twin. 


I didnt."
"Sister, Sister","Sister Sister was so good! It lost its way a little when they became ‘cool’ though.  I liked them being dorky.

I’d put it up there with Sabrina and Teen Angel."
"Sister, Sister","Sweet, love the classic UPN lineup"
"Sister, Sister","This is great news , most of these shows didn't even get a DVD release."
"Sister, Sister",No Martin? Fuck.
"Sister, Sister","I wanted Family Matters ;/ 

But I guess I have enough DVR'd on YTTV anyway"
"Sister, Sister",They need Smart Guy too. That’s a classic
"Sister, Sister",They're bringing th old UPN lineup out
"Sister, Sister",Justice for my wife and kids
"Sister, Sister","MO TO THE

E TO THE"
"Sister, Sister","Grew up watching this stuff, Ill probably ignore it with the rest of the stuff on Netflix as I rewatch starship troopers."
"Sister, Sister",Eyyyy!!! Put in Wayans Brothers and Jamie Foxx in there too please
"Sister, Sister","For all the 1990s-nostalgia we’ve been getting, one thing that was not joining along was the R&B/Black sitcom shows from the WB/UPN from that era. Never figured out why."
"Sister, Sister","I never realized how much I missed shows like *Moesha*, *The Game*, *The Parkers* and *Sister Sister* until this was announced. This is going to make staying at home a little bit more bearable as it will be very refreshing to be able to watch these shows on demand. I can't even remember the last time I've watched any of them. Great news!"
"Sister, Sister","I’m excited for this! I used to love Girlfriends, and never knew why it wasn’t streaming. Can’t wait to do a rewatch"
"Sister, Sister","Still no In Living Color, bummer"
"Sister, Sister",I feel like In the House should have been on this list.
"Sister, Sister",UPN is coming back
"Sister, Sister",Heeeeeyyyyyyy professa ogleveeeeeeee!!!!
"Sister, Sister","When I was a kid, I would watch One on One because i had a crush on Kyla Pratt. Didn't like the show at all. But I liked Kyla Pratt.

I used to watch the show Girlfriends almost every Sunday night too. Hated that show, but damn dude. I didn't have cable and there was nothing else on. This was before you could just find any movie or show online. Like a few years before that era started. All the other channels had were infomercials around that time or the news. I think I was in my first year of college or it could have been late high school, I can't even remember honestly. But just thinking about that show right now fills me with the opposite of nostalgia. it fills me with dread. I'm dead inside now days, but holy crap, those days were dreadful. I was failing my college classes. I didnt want to be in school. No direction. Everything just sucked until I started working with my friends.

I remember Moesha being alright. It would come on when i was in middle school and high school I think It'd be on after school and I'd watch it after Toonami was over or Dragon Ball Z was over. I remember it always being Sailor Moon then Dragon Ball Z then Reboot and then some other show I can't remember. But then when they started Gundam shows after DBZ, i'd just watch something else. Eventually they changed up to be Sailor Moon, Dragon Ball, and then Dragon Ball Z and some other shows I think. 

I saw glimpses of the other shows, but never watched them that much. i'm a black guy, but none of these shows ever appealed to me. The ""black shows"" that did appeal me were Smart Guy, Steve Harvey Show (the sitcom), My Brother and Me, Family Matters, the Sinbad Show, Good Times, Sanford and Son, Fresh Prince, My Wife and Kids, A Different World, Bernie Mac Show (i dont think this is considered s sitcom though?), Jeffersons, Waynes Bros, Jamie Foxx Show, That's So Raven, What's Happening, Hanging with Mr Cooper, Kenan and Kel, In the House, On Our Own, The Hughleys, and so many more. 

Every 90's kid needs to experience My Brother and Me. ALL the episodes are on Youtube. Download them for later because they'll probably be taken down. here's a random episode: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI1itsIg32Y It's made of pure 90's."
"Sister, Sister",Wow I’m surprised Netflix was able to get some of these shows. I guess we have to thank the streaming wars alongside the people for this one.
"Sister, Sister","I'm so excited for the game, but disappointed its only the first 3 seasons. Hopefully they are working on getting the remaining seasons that were on bet."
"Sister, Sister",Great news. Wish they could add Living Single too.
"Sister, Sister","Man I really wish they would have decided to put on Sister, Sister first but I'll take Moesha with no complaints."
"Sister, Sister",P.S. Check this box if you like Moesha[ _ ]
"Sister, Sister",MO TO THA
"Sister, Sister","I had a really bad vertigo episode and stupidly went to an urgent care (it's stupid because they didn't do anything for me and told me if it got worse to go to the ER), and while I was sitting in the waiting room trying not to vomit, a random woman was repeatedly playing the opening part of the Sister Sister theme song. Sister Siiiiiiisterrrr. It was stuck in my head for weeks."
"Sister, Sister","Girlfriends will be the first thing I watch 
Tracy Ellis Ross i need not say more"
"Sister, Sister","Add in Hanging with Mr. Cooper and In the House, and I'll be a happy man."
"Sister, Sister",Wayne’s Bros?
"Sister, Sister",Please please be WW
"Sister, Sister",[deleted]
"Sister, Sister",There is a God!
"Sister, Sister","I am waiting for the day Disney plus releases FAMILY MATTERS.

"Sister, Sister",Where’s The Smart Guy?!
"Sister, Sister",Moesha still needs a finale. Literally the worst series cliffhanger I’ve ever seen.
"Sister, Sister",YASSSSSSSSSS OMG there were so many good black sitcoms in the 90s early 2000s. i’m hype when i catch a random rerun. can’t wait to binge!
"Sister, Sister",Wish they would bring The Jamie Foxx show...
"Sister, Sister",Member-berries
"Sister, Sister",This is my childhood growing up in the 90s.
"Sister, Sister",Girlfriends was my show!
"Sister, Sister",I want my wife and kids
"Sister, Sister",What about The Parent’Hood?!?
"Sister, Sister",Mo to the..
"Sister, Sister","Netflix needs Living Single, Martin, Wayans Bros and In Living Color"
"Sister, Sister",These shows need a sub reddit page.
"Sister, Sister",Anybody see the irony of “The Parkers” going to Netflix!?!
"Sister, Sister",Looks like shows from 2004 Disney Chanel
"Sister, Sister",Was really hoping for Martin.
"Sister, Sister",Wish I had hulu
"Sister, Sister",No more grainy YouTube Sister Sister reruns!
"Sister, Sister",I was hoping it was going to say the share the same Cinematic Universe.
"Sister, Sister",But what about Mr Cooper? Who is hangin’ with him? I need to know!
"Sister, Sister",Still waiting on Family Matters...
"Sister, Sister","Where is ""Hangin with Mr. Cooper"" ?

Loved that show"
"Sister, Sister",Finally!!! Now add Fresh Prince and Martin.
"Sister, Sister",Omg yes!
"Sister, Sister",No “Hangin with Mr Cooper”?
"Sister, Sister","I just say I wrote it for your girlfriends, Kelsey Grammar."
"Sister, Sister",Best news ever
"Sister, Sister",But no fresh prince?
"Sister, Sister",Upn 9 hitters right here
"Sister, Sister",If they could re add fawlty towers I’d be happy.
"Sister, Sister",Sucks we can’t get martin

"Sister, Sister",The Game!!! So excited!!!
"Sister, Sister",GIVE US HOMEBOYS FROM OUTER SPACE YOU COWARDS!
"Sister, Sister","Homeboy in Outer Space?   Huh? Guys? Anyone? Hey, you're leaving without me! You're literally walking away from me! You are walking in all directions opposite of mine! Some are now jogging while others speedwalk! You're getting in your cars and flooring it! Oh my God, someone just jumped off a cliff! We're in a suburb, where'd the cliff come from?"
"Sister, Sister",I love Girlfriends and Half and Half. I'm glad they're finally streaming and on a popular platform.
"Sister, Sister","Oh, hey! Some Kelsey Grammar joints!"
"Sister, Sister","Is there any news for other territories? Canada specifically.

I only ask because they similarly announced last month that Kingdom (UK) was going to be added in July for the US. It's now going to be added to Canada in August."
"Sister, Sister",I’m gonna need Hanging with Mr Cooper to be added as well please.
"Sister, Sister",Still waiting on The Wayans Bros
"Sister, Sister",Wake me up when they get _Hangin' with Mr Cooper_
"Sister, Sister","One on One intro had me hooked a kid, loved the show too, half and half was good as well. Now...saved by the bell anyone?"
"Sister, Sister","Rachel True was my reason for watching Half and Half, so it looks like it’ll be time to revisit that show once it comes out in October. :)"
"Sister, Sister","All of these shows sound vaguely familiar, I'm fairly certain they were on a channel called Trouble here in Ireland"
"Sister, Sister",I had the biggest crush on T from the Parker’s !!! Still waiting on My Wife and Kids.
"Sister, Sister","Great....

How about they produce a decent comedy? Or pay for one?

B list movies/shows and crappy originals just give people more reason to shut off Netflix and tune in to Hulu/Tv/youtube"
"Sister, Sister",No thanks. Don't want any yelling coming from my t.v..  MmmHmmmm...
"Sister, Sister",Hangin with Mr. Cooper?
"Sister, Sister",WE STILL NEED MARTIN!!!! @netflix
"Sister, Sister","I thought the good ones were Different Strokes, Family Matters, the Hughleys, Living Single and Martin."
"Sister, Sister","Who the hell wants to rewatch Sister Sister, I'm so close to canceling Netflix."
"Sister, Sister",Ahhh yes the shows that came on the WB network after cartoons on weekday afternoons growing up. I usually changed over to Fox for Simpsons reruns.
"Sister, Sister","Oh man, Moesha and Sister Sister was my childhood and I’m white as snow."
"Sister, Sister","Sister Sister, Half & Half, One on One... god, they were so formulaic."
"Sister, Sister","Are these really iconic to the black community though? Or are they simply being added for the color of their skin and not the content of their show? 

Seriously asking because I've never heard of any of these."
"Sister, Sister",Why is that I read the first couple titles and immediately thought the article was gonna be about the lead actress dying
"Sister, Sister","Ah, when Monique was funny."

Growing Up,"I remember growing up with Boy Meets World. Cory Mathews taught me so much about everything. An example of one that's still on is The Simpsons. They've been running all my life, but they don't have the same level of growth. With Boy Meets World, they would be older every year, in a new school, new friends, and have new family members. A very unique period for television."
Growing Up,"Not gonna lie, really wish streaming services didn't have such short seasons and short runs in general. I didn't mind the ""filler episodes"" back in the day as I found they often added fun nuance and background to characters you often don't have time to show in new shows."
Growing Up,"Very true. I miss how it all used to work - excitement of autumn when all the new seasons would start. And waiting a week for the next episode, it really built up the hype. (God I’m sounding old haha)

And finding a good series where there’s 20 eps a season and like 5+ seasons….
Buffy was probably the ultimate for me. Obviously there’s a drop off in later seasons, but by then you love the characters and want to know what happens anyway."
Growing Up,"Sam and Dean for me.
At least we have Doctor Who, sorta."
Growing Up,"Knots Landing did this perfectly.  It ran on CBS for 14 years.  Each week was like catching up with the neighbors.  Given its longevity, the characters (and viewers) were taken through courtships, marriages, divorces, murders, deaths."
Growing Up,I grew up with Bud and Kelly Bundy
Growing Up,"My friends and I are getting long in the tooth (over 60).  We often talk about ""Thursday Night TV"" - the height of ""Seinfeld"" and other sitcoms.  I do miss the weekly ""well what did you think of last night's episode?"" on Friday mornings at work.  Not so much 'growing up' but weekly TV discussions were a thing between me and my co-workers.

I visited a dear friend recently that I worked with for years - we had many Friday morning discussions of the previous night's TV.  All we did was watch ""Seinfeld"" reruns and it was awesome due to the history we had with that show."
Growing Up,"This line kills me every time: “You're not being asked to do anything that none of us hasn't done before in our own kitchens in our own homes! Now quick, Niles, kill five eels!”"
Growing Up,I miss everything about TV in the mid-2000's to early 2010's. Yup commericals are annoying and prices got crazy but the actualy experience of watching TV was so much better back then.
Growing Up,I watched Skins and it was the most character changes in a show I’ve ever seen. It’s like whiplash.
Growing Up,"Cheers spinning off into Frasier.   
Cheers started before my time but my parents watched it so it was on in the background until I started watching it and then Frasier.   
At the same time MASH was on repeat.   
Each series has 11 seasons, 33 years of programming that had that 'always there' feeling.   
   
The Next Gen, DS9, Voyager run was awesome too. Sooo much good Trek."
Growing Up,"oh absolutely, also seems pertinent that [Ash and Pikachu are being ""retired"" after 25 years](https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/tv/2022/12/19/ash-ketchum-leaving-pokemon/10925383002/).

I grew up coming home from school and eating a snack while watching Pokemon before starting my homework. 

Growing up and seeing Ash and Pikachu almost every day for \~15 years builds another kind of connection that you don't get from a lot of these ""quick"" 3-5 season shows on Netflix, even if you do relate to the characters."
Growing Up,Yea I know what you mean! This happened to me years ago when I watched the first two seasons of Skins (UK version). I got so attached to those characters and was genuinely so sad when their arc was over and they moved on to the next generation of kids.
Growing Up,"I wonder if the rewatch and hindsight are more streaming friendly.

Younger me caught the tail end of House and, to my dumb teen brain with limited interest in something that wasn't a video game, he was the cool sarcastic guy in a room of boring people whose procedures hampered his Big Brain.

With streaming it's easy on a whim to go back and watch all the episodes in line and see how much I missed. See it through the new lens of understanding a workplace. Would I have followed out of pace reruns or sold my dog's kidneys for series DVDs to get that pre-streaming? Idk."
Growing Up,Sitcoms really don't hurt having long seasons but dramas and other one hour shows don't need more than 12 episodes a season.
Growing Up,"> Scully and Mulder


Fix this please."
Growing Up,Yup. Maybe now that I think about it one of the reasons I've stopped watching TV and play more games.
Growing Up,"Yes and no. 

Yes, I personally love weekly releases for that reason. Especially when it’s a “podcastable” show where you can dive deep an think about what you’re watching. GoT/HotD is perfect for this, other shows like White Lotus and other character driven shows work well too. 

No, I personally don’t miss characters on procedurals like Law and Order or any of the crime/medical dramas simply because I find the characters wildly inconsistent. It’s just impossible to write them well because of the volume over time."
Growing Up,"Honestly, no. 

I rarely watched TV as a kid and most shows were designed so that anyone could watch an episode when it came on. 

Now shows are actual stories, with season long arcs and sometimes multi season arcs. It's nice to be able to watch them when you have time. If not for streaming, I'd never watch any TV."
Growing Up,I don't see this not being the case.  NCIS is still airing with at least two series one cast members.  NCIS Angeles is in season 13 or 14.  One Piece is past the 1000 episode count months ago.  Network tv still does this readily.
Growing Up,"Those kind of tv shows still exist and are still airing, maybe you just choose not to watch them"
Growing Up,My grandmother loved soap operas so…yes. I don’t watch General Hospital often anymore but Elizabeth Webber and I are the same age. We started out in high school together and are tipping into middle age.
Growing Up,Shameless
Growing Up,"Yes, my biggest one was probably 24. Starting it when I was 18 and watching it over the years was so much fun"
Growing Up,so how do we change this back
Growing Up,I wish I got old with Arthur Spooner
Growing Up,Northern Exposure.
Growing Up,"100%.  I miss longer seasons of shows, but I also miss annual seasons of shows.  I liked how they'd operate on a school year type schedule."
Growing Up,"Absolutely, I identified with Cory so much and learned a lot of life’s lessons from the show, I mean Mr. Feeny"
Growing Up,"People like to crap on filler eps, but they never really bothered me that much.  Some were better than others, but the good ones could be great.  It allows a story to take its time, world build, explore other aspects of characters or the setting.  You just don't want it to drag for too long."
Growing Up,"I think sitcoms need filler episodes, creating the dynamics is so important to comedy and you just don't do that in 8 episodes. Even a show like Reboot which I think is one of the better sitcoms to come out of streaming had a season one finale that (IMO) didn't fully land because it needed at least 4 or 5 more episodes to build the relationships that the finale relies on."
Growing Up,It all depends on the show and the story that show is telling. One single story? Short seasons are gonna be best. Season-long stories (a la Buffy) or episodic shows (most sitcoms)? *Please* pump those episode numbers up! I want character examination!
Growing Up,"I think the lack of long seasons hurts so many shows.
Rick and morty would be better if it was allowed to breath just a little."
Growing Up,so how do we fix it
Growing Up,"hopefully the new protagonists' journey lasts just as long (as I doubt they'd swap them out every season when they aren't the default game protags). Also it's been long enough that if he aged in real time and the tone (and ages of his companions) followed Ash would be 35, so yeah ""your childhood"" in that sense might be ending but you're not a child anymore and on a lot of levels neither is he, so don't go harshing someone else's childhood because it's not yours.

Also they probably aren't retiring Pikachu from being mascot, it's just too iconic otherwise"
Growing Up,Examples please!!!!! Apparently I am missing out.
Growing Up,What are they? I am  interested to know as long as it's not cop/hospital shows and soap operas. I'm serious I would like to know some of these I'm not being sarcastic.
Growing Up,In terms of sitcoms there’s only like 4 or 5 right now and while they are okay none are in that upper echelon we haven’t seen since the Office / Parks and Rec days
Growing Up,as long as the filler isn't in the form of a clip show... i can maaaybe give it a pass.
Growing Up,As long as the filler episode have good character moments I’m fine with them
Growing Up,They also added pacing that made the impactful events feel bigger. It gives time to decompress and process what happened and then build up to what came next.
Growing Up,"100% agree. Reboot is the perfect example of this. GREAT SHOW! Laughed the whole way. But I was genuinely confused at the season finale. I was like ""this is it?"""
Growing Up,The 20+ season format was built around sitcoms originally and they really need it for the most part. Sitcoms don’t need to have a strong narrative we just need a cast of characters that we want to be around and find funny.
Growing Up,"It absolutely needed at least 12 episodes.

I don't even get why it was so short. It's not like it's a special effect heavy show."
Growing Up,"I'd argue there's no such thing as filler when it comes to sitcoms really, most have little in the way of a narrative throughline and are kind of built on the idea of placing the characters in new and amusing situations each episode. A situational comedy if you will."
Growing Up,"I think you're trying to read between the lines when there's nothing there.

I'm absolutely not ""harshing"" any shorter shows, I watch many of them myself. I'm simply agreeing with OP and using Pokemon as an example of a show that's gone on for a long/extended period of time."
Growing Up,Look at any network television schedule and pick your poison
Growing Up,"There aren’t many serialized dramas bc it’s weird to keep resetting if it isn’t a cop or hospital show. Bad guy or the week type show. So no cop or hospitals - CW DC shows and 911 which is a fire fighter show (technicality). Sitcoms - Abbott, home economics, ghost, neighborhood. Look at the networks lineup"
Growing Up,Abott elementary is a good one
Growing Up,"Oh god, retrospective/clip episodes are literally the worst..."
Growing Up,Yes it was like …ok guess we are done nowadays
Growing Up,"Yeah, Reboot needed 12-16 episodes imo"
Growing Up,"I think you're right, it's *filler* by today's standard but really it's just what the medium is supposed to be"
Growing Up,A second 911 but some of their recuses are absurd
Growing Up,The absurdity is what makes it so enjoyable. It’s basically a remake of the 70’s show Emergency!
Growing Up,"The thing I remember About that TDs how was the lead had the coolest in show name, Johnny Gage, but his real name was Randolph Mantooth, which is opposite."
Growing Up,"I'm old.  I grew up watching Sid and Marty Kroft stuff like The Bugaloos, Dr. Shrinker, HR Puffenstuff.

In college, I discovered 3rd wave Ska and particularly, The Aquabats.

Then I discovered The Aquabats Super Show.  I had come full circle.

&#x200B;

Side note:  I met Bat-Commander while he was promoting his brother's doodling class.  Super friendly guy."
Growing Up,The title has me interested.
Growing Up,"I saw it on UK TV, but I was already an adult at the time."
Growing Up,"Grew up with it as a child in Australia, can't tell you anything more than that lol, apologies as I don't have much memories beyond that."
Growing Up,Only the first season. I remember being so young and wanting to find out what happened to them next after they were launched into space
Growing Up,I sought it out because I was already a huge Aquabats fan since 1998ish. I've never seen it on tv
Growing Up,"I'm unapologetically a fan of third wave ska.
*Great* shit to dance and jam to."
Growing Up,i remember it was on citv
Growing Up,Rennervations. RENNERVATIONS?!?!
Growing Up,Jeremy Renner is  the last person I’d expect to see in a home renovation show lol
Growing Up,Rennervations sounds like a pitch Princess Carolyn would’ve made on Bojack Horseman.
Growing Up,Are there any other MCU actors that Twitter and Reddit hate?
Growing Up,I have some reservations
Growing Up,"> ***Growing Up*** is a hybrid docu-series that explores the challenges, triumphs, and complexities of adolescence through ten compelling coming of age stories.

> The series comes from Val and Cheer producer Boardwalk Pictures. Renner exec produces alongside Rory Millikin, Romilda De Luca, Andrew Fried, Dane Lillegard, Sarina Roma, and Patrick Costello."
Growing Up,"I wasn't aware that people actively disliked Renner but I think he'll always have my respect for being willing to sacrifice his roles to be able to spend as much as time as possible with his daughter. 

For those who are unaware, he has clauses in his contracts that allow him to fly to be with his daughter as much as he can, at minimum every weekend I believe. He even told Marvel that they can recast him if they wish."
Growing Up,Sadly Brie Larson jumped on the NFT ship so.... We don't know her anymore.
Growing Up,Why so much Jeremy renner who is it for?
Growing Up,"I just listened to his episode of Armchair Expert, and he's actually a pretty cool guy. He owns something like 30 fire trucks and other interesting specialty vehicles. He talked about wanting to repurpose them for a 2nd life so to speak. For example, renting out a fire truck for kid's birthday parties that has an ice cream machine built in, and things like that. Dude is a jack of all trades -- started out working a makeup counter and now he's saving the universe."
Growing Up,Brie Larson also thinks NFTs are good. So....fuck that.
Growing Up,Haven't we suffered enough??
Growing Up,These 2 did an interview once. It was very uncomfortable to watch
Growing Up,No fucking thank you.
Growing Up,Renner does kind of look like an extremely competent home remodeler that definitely bangs your wife
Growing Up,I can't wait to not watch these
Growing Up,Larson and non-scripted eh? Is it also Non-Fungible?
Growing Up,Serious question:  What does non-scripted series mean?
Growing Up,"Both sound like important, socially relevant television that would be torture to actually watch."
Growing Up,Money laundering
Growing Up,She's been acting since she was a child the fuck she know about growing up
Growing Up,Imagine watching this.
Growing Up,Does that mean Brie Larson might come to Reno???
Growing Up,"Okay, I'm more interested in Brie's series. I mean, I wanna know more about what video games she's played. She clearly likes Metroid."
Growing Up,🖕🏻Just for you Larson
Growing Up,Wasn’t this dude just involved in a domestic violence altercation?
Growing Up,"Dear god, the two worst things about the avengers. No thank you."
Growing Up,I wonder if Brie Larson is going to NTF her “other type” pics. Even tho she is NTF crazy she’s still a smoke show.
Growing Up,"It doesn't help that I read this [article on reddit](https://whatsondisneyplus.com/disney-unscripted-content-considered-a-mess/) yesterday. I do hope Disney+ realizes the potential of not just releasing family-friendly shows like these to gain more audience. I know they have Hulu but man, they have a lot of hidden stuff in their vault that makes sense to get from Disney+. Give me ""Seconds from Disaster"" on NatGeo pls."
Growing Up,they finally sauced jeremy renner a show for something he did in between roles
Growing Up,"they couldn't sound more different. Renner be like ""alrighto, you go talk to ninnies about them being ninnies, I've got a Peterbilt to repurpose as a steakhouse and drive it for 3780 miles, shirtless and oily"""
Growing Up,brie larson...no thanks.
Growing Up,Brie bros; we win.
Growing Up,How many episodes in until she domestically abuses him?
Growing Up,didn’t he beat his wife?
The Lawyer,Why isn’t The Good Fight just on regular CBS?  Why hide it.
The Lawyer,"Ugh...I cannot stand Franich. His articles always drone on. And besides he's wrong. There will always be the  main professions as tv series. They might change up here & there. But they make for good procedurals. Yes, I said it. But it doesn't mean they ALL will be good."
The Lawyer,"I don't think I'd even seriously class The Good Fight as a lawyer show at this point, it's far more politics based, bordering on propaganda."
The Lawyer,What’s this from?
The Lawyer,"I like Kevin Smith a lot but it's some point Kevin Smith chose to do live mic discussions as opposed to sit in a writers room all day and I say that as a huge fan of his early work.    He now likes to tour and speak at universities more than he likes Writing Movies.   

No one is making Kevin write inferior work compared to his earlier days"
The Lawyer,"When speaking about things he loves, Kevin Smith really shows his vulnerable yet masculine side, and does it well. He should write and direct some dramas. Maybe a geek ""On Golden Pond."" I think he has a lot more to say than what Jay and Silent Bob has. "
The Lawyer,This show had potential and they totally porked it by airing it out of order. 
The Lawyer,"I loved that show.
"
The Lawyer,Commentary on the last episode of clerks animated series
The Lawyer,Does anyone want Kevin to write movies? It’s been downhill since Clerks 2
The Lawyer,"Yes, he's still writing, but mostly just cheesy horror movies. 

People still seem to enjoy them."
The Lawyer,I loved both Tusk and Red State. Haven’t seen Yoga Hosers yet though.
The Lawyer,What the fuck are you talking about
The Lawyer,This is referring to the Newsroom.  OP neglected to post that in the title.
The Lawyer,"Derp. Good catch. I think I hit ""suggest title"" and forgot to change it. Ah well, it doesn't really matter at this point."
The Lawyer,So it’s about a dead lawyer?
The Lawyer,They should’ve casted that redhead girl who played the recurring autistic elite lawyer in the good wife. Her character was so fun.
The Lawyer,It'll be good to have a character who can look others in the eye.
The Lawyer,I really liked the first season of Nancy Drew. And then.... And then... And then it went off the rails :(
The Lawyer,This isn’t Attorney Woo is it?
The Lawyer,"Felicity Huffman.

okay!"
The Lawyer,"So reading the article…this isn’t a spin-off? 

It’s just a backdoor pilot that they’re hoping gets made into a spin-off? Am I reading that right?"
The Lawyer,"I actually thought season 2 of ND was stronger than its first season. I LOVED season 2 a lot. It's the season that I've recommended to my friends to watch and it has one of my favourite plot twist reveals for television.

Season 3, on the other hand, was a massive step down for me."
The Lawyer,"I think it’s the rare example of a CW show that has maintained a decent quality throughout. Each season has had its ups and downs, but they’ve all been pretty solid. Not great by any stretch of the imagination, but above average. 

I have no interest in whatever this new role for her is."
The Lawyer,"I don’t think it went off the rails.

It just got seriously off-track with the Aglaeca subplot, then course corrected."
The Lawyer,I can't remember how many back door pilots I've seen but it's pretty high and they all seemed to have failed bar a couple exceptions
The Lawyer,"

Angel:
You're not gonna win.

Holland:
Well...no. Of course we aren't. We have no intention of doing anything so prosaic as ""winning"". [laughs]

Angel:
Then why?

Holland:
Hmm? I'm sorry, why what?

Angel:
Why fight?

Holland:
That's really the question you should be asking yourself, isn't it? See, for us, there is no fight. Which is why winning doesn't enter into it. We...go on, no matter what. Our firm has always been here...in one form or another. The Inquisition. The Khmer Rouge. We were there when the very first cave man clubbed his neighbor. See, we're in the hearts and minds of every single living being. And that, friend, is what's making things so difficult for you. See, the world doesn't work in spite of evil, Angel. It works with us. It works because of us.

[elevator comes to a stop and the doors open, revealing Los Angeles]

Holland:
Welcome to the home office.

Angel:
This isn't...

Holland:
Oh, you know it is. You know that better than anyone. Things you've seen. Things you've-well, done. You see, if there wasn't evil in every single one of them out there-why, they wouldn't be people. They'd all be angels.

[Angel slowly walks out of the elevator]

Holland:
Have a nice day.


-------------------
these encounters only served to keep Wolfram and Hart as this huge evil that wasn't just the big bad of the season like Buffy's first evil felt, Wolfram feels like the worst of humanity personified throughout all the seasons, it doesn't seem like they'd ever truely disappear as long as humanity exists they exist. 

I don't think anything has come close to them throughout any television show I've watched since."
The Lawyer,He’s not always a direct antagonist but Boyd Crowder from Justified?
The Lawyer,"I’ll always love angel because for me it was the first show I watched that had a overarching storyline with a villain (Jasmine) that lasted all season. It still had monster of the week but if I recall correctly she was the overarching big baddy for the season. 

And the ending of the season, where everyone was happy to be part of a hive mind and angel defeated her  then it was kinda questioned whether this is what was best for humanity…shit blew my 14 year old mind"
The Lawyer,Scorpius in Farscape springs to mind.
The Lawyer,*Laughs in Gul Dukat*
The Lawyer,"That's a very fair point, I can't come up with a better one off the top of my head, although W&H has a few things about it that don't really make any sense so it can get slightly cringy at times"
The Lawyer,"The observers in Fringe tied the whole series together, I'd say they do it better since Angel was lacking focus at times."
The Lawyer,There's a reason Angel is my number 1 favorite TV show and you just nailed it! Closest to another series matching this quality for me has gotta be my number 2 favorite Smallville.
The Lawyer,Which is great because he wasn't supposed to be a recurring character but Walton Goggins was so amazing they wrote him into the rest of the show
The Lawyer,"I don't know, Dukat was messy. Felt like they couldn't quite decide if they were redeeming him, then there's all the Pah-wraith stuff that doesn't quite work."
The Lawyer,"I think they knew quite well what Dukat’s trajectory would be. They introduced a facet of him for a while where he *felt* that he could change, but ultimately his pride and ego won out. A shit leopard can’t change his spots, and thought it was an interesting arc they explored.

I somewhat agree with you in regards to the pah-wraith stuff later down the line, namely because it goes a little too heavy into the super natural for a Star Trek show. 

But what helps it along I think is the death of his daughter - his lust for power over the weak bajorans (in his eyes), intersecting with his then budding religious beliefs, co-opting or appropriating it from them in a sense. It’s a perverse play on his established character thus far in the show and thought it was also a great arc for him.

Hoping that all made sense I dunno it’s 5AM and haven’t slept lol. I just like talking about Star Trek"
The Lawyer,They should have left his story with him being broken. It was a crime to not let Wynn be the conduit of the Pah-wraiths.
The Lawyer,"> I think they knew quite well what Dukat’s trajectory would be.

I'm not sure they did. I mean, look how hard Nana Visitor had to fight against the idea of a Kira/Dukat romance."
The Lawyer,"One of my favourite seasons of television, such an impressive cast. I'm a big fan of Jeffrey Donovan's turn as Dodd Gerhardt, which I feel doesn't get enough love when it's surrounded by 10-20 other phenomenal performances."
The Lawyer,The standoff at the police station was incredible.
The Lawyer,"“No, pretty unfriendly really. But it's the way you're unfriendly. Like you're doin' me a favor.” is the best line to come out of that show.  So good they had to use it again in season 4."
The Lawyer,Jefferey Donavan as Dodd was just one of the greatest performances on TV.  He was so stupid and violent.
The Lawyer,Season 2 is my favorite and the best imo. Mike milligan was a badass
The Lawyer,"""Are you Mike Milligan and the Kitchen Brothers?""

""When you say it like that it sounds like a progressive rock band"""
The Lawyer,"No love for Zahn McClarnon?

His performance as Hanzee is impeccable."
The Lawyer,"Yeah, I agree. Season 2 has been the high water mark for the show so far. I really liked the bit where season 2 was the prequel to season 1. The actor that played Hanzee is now on Reservation Dogs and he’s great in that too."
The Lawyer,"“It's just a flying saucer, hon, we got to go.”"
The Lawyer,"All of it was great, but I really enjoyed the Zahn and Bokeem characters and to see them both survive and complete their arcs in the way they did at the end was satisfying. It also taught me that Jean Smart was a lot more than just one of the ladies from Designing Women."
The Lawyer,Season 2 is fantastic for sure
The Lawyer,"I’m in the minority but I thought season 1 was far better, the characters were just so much more interesting"
The Lawyer,Agreed. May be my fav season of a show ever. True detective is close.
The Lawyer,"I love Season 2. And I loved Season 3 as well, maybe more than most people do, but I just loved David Thewlis's character as an antagonist."
The Lawyer,"Every little thing and every big thing is fantastic. Every subplot and the main plot. Every main character and every supporting character. The writing, pacing, plot, setting, music, all of it. 

I have no idea who won awards for that season or who they were up against but I am convinced that the Fargo S2 cast was robbed. Ted Danson - robbed. Jeffrey Donovan - robbed. Meth Damon - robbed. Kirsten Dunst - FUCKING ROBBED."
The Lawyer,"It was such a wonderful follow up to season 1. Both together are some of the best TV to happen imo. Incredibly engaging with remarkable characters and memorable scenes. No one was wasted and all played a significant part to each story. Perfect balance of drama/comedy/dread/action/mystery.
I see no fault in them. All that said, never finished S3 or even watched S4. Should I?"
The Lawyer,"Honestly I thought all 4 seasons were stunning. I couldn't pick a favorite, would be either season 2 or 3 for sure. It is a show I could watch over and over again. I am curious what season 5 will be like. Apparently set in 2019 and starring Jon Hamm. I'm excited."
The Lawyer,Second and third seasons of Fargo is one of the best seasons of TV I have ever seen.
The Lawyer,every single frame of Fargo S2 is exceptional
The Lawyer,One of the most compelling villains in recent television. If you've seen the series you probably know who I'm talking about.
The Lawyer,"I like Season 1 more than Season 2, I thought Season 1 had a much better ending."
The Lawyer,"One of my favourite television watching experiences. I like the movie but it's probably not even one of my favourite Coen films, and then you have the first season which is also good but for me nothing special. I was a bit unsure about whether the show would be good after that but the second season blew me away."
The Lawyer,"One of my favorite parts of any show ever was the hoarding situation being revealed. My grandmother was a hoarder. As in stacks of newspapers creating a maze throughout the house type of hoarder. When I saw Kirsten Dunst showing the hoarding symptoms but only having a few visual cues of stacked magazine and the like, I was desperately curious about their basement. The whole revelation of it and the suspense with Dodd was absolutely fucking spot on. The sheer shock and confusion on his face when he sees the basement is so fucking legit. I related HARD. And of course the way the whole situation plays out is fucking impeccable. Love it. I legit reminisce about watching that scene for the first time. It was SO REAL."
The Lawyer,Seasons 1-3 of this show are superb with 2 being the absolute stand out that I've gone back to rewatch... which I have rarely ever done outside of Breaking Bad and Mr Robot.
The Lawyer,"First 3 seasons of Fargo are all extremely good television. Season 4 went horrifically off the rails imo, but 3 out of 4 is an excellent batting average I guess"
The Lawyer,The first two were some of the finest television I've ever seen. Haven't seen them since they aired. But I remember loving them.
The Lawyer,"I only watched Season 1 and I thought it was one of the best transformation of a character I had seen since Breaking Bad. I was hesitant to watch another season because I thought it wouldn't live up to the first one, but I might try the second one. It's not the first time I heard it's great"
The Lawyer,"I couldn't agree more, but also thought Martin Freeman was just brilliant in season one."
The Lawyer,Fargo Season 2 made me watch seasons 3 and 4. It was “wow… what are the gonna fuckin’ do next…”
The Lawyer,Jean smart should have won an emmy for her performance in this season
The Lawyer,I laughed out loud at Mile Milligan’s ending.  Torture for him.
The Lawyer,"The general consensus seems to be that Season 2 is the best season of this show, but I still think the first season was better."
The Lawyer,"Agree with all of the above, this was some brilliant television. If you like this calibre of tv you should seek out The Bureau, it’s a French series about their secret service. It’s available on Sundance here in Canada. It may be hard to find but worth the effort. I promise"
The Lawyer,And you didn't even mention the music. God level.
The Lawyer,Bro wtf? I just finished Fargo season 1 and now I see this post. Sweet lol
The Lawyer,"Feel like I’m in the minority but I didn’t like 2 as much as 1. I have only seen the first 2 seasons, both within the last year so it’s recent for me."
The Lawyer,"It's the best season, but all three are great..."
The Lawyer,The first three seasons were amazing imo.  Just so good.
The Lawyer,I think S2 was the best so far. But the scene in S1 when Billy Bob goes into the building is still the best scene ever recorded in all of film/TV history.
The Lawyer,"I found it to be one of the best  works of television I had ever watched, right up to when the you-know-whats showed up. I was, *what the fuck*..."
The Lawyer,I loved the first season but 2 was definitely better. Unfortunately I just can’t connect with season 3 watched a few episodes but I am not really into it tbh!
The Lawyer,"Fargo season 2 is probably my favorite season of any show ever. Season 1 was good, 2 was amazing, but it went downhill after 2."
The Lawyer,I remember it having one of the most fake looking gun effects on a big budget serier i have seen in a while
The Lawyer,Yeah my favorite season for sure. Really hit on all cylinders.
The Lawyer,"Strongest season of the show imo, and that’s no small praise."
The Lawyer,"Fargo is one of my favorite things on TV. I love how the writers choose to thread these characters between seasons - Lou Solverson and Mr. Wrench, throughout the first three seasons, and Mike Milligan in the second and fourth seasons. 

Primary characters or supporting characters, they all have the opportunity to be a branch into another story in another time and it's a style of world-building that I absolutely love."
The Lawyer,"Yeah it was okay. Nothing special, but fairly absorbing. Season 1 was better imo."
The Lawyer,Wait til you get to season 3 … the themes discussed were years ahead of its time. Look at the release date before you watch if
The Lawyer,Top tier television
The Lawyer,I feel the first 3 seasons stand alone as top tier television
The Lawyer,“You will know the angels when they come. They will have the faces of your children.” That’s some good stuff right there.
The Lawyer,"Haven't seen yet. Watched couple episodes years ago, but never finish it. Is it really that good?"
The Lawyer,"Loved season one and two, four I quite enjoyed too. Season three, I don't think I've ever finished watching a season of something I hated more. I will usually bail on something I dislike as much as that, I think I enjoyed the first two so much that it would somehow get better. For me, it really didn't."
The Lawyer,season 4 was boring right?
The Lawyer,"I'm watching season 3 now, and 2 was good but I think could've been way better if more focus/content would've been on the Indian ""Hanzee Dent"" played by Zahn McClarnon."
The Lawyer,One of the absolute best seasons of TV of all time.
The Lawyer,"Season 1 was WAY WAY WAY better. But season 2 was good, season 3 was good, but not great and season 4 was meh."
The Lawyer,Yeah Dodd was a compelling character. Really liked Donovan's performance too.
The Lawyer,When I find you darling I'm gonna make you bleed
The Lawyer,I think Satans a woman.
The Lawyer,Nick Offerman was incredible in that episode. Not all lawyers are jerks.
Hassel,"Oh man I forgot about this show, I remember liking it. All that is beside the point death is sad and this is sad to hear"
Hassel,I live three miles away from where that happened. Looks like he was at the Gables apartment complex - a somewhat luxury apartment.
Hassel,"In case anyone else is wondering about the location, beyond ""somewhere in Texas,"" it's in Grand Prairie, in the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex.  https://www.cnn.com/2020/11/02/entertainment/actor-eddie-hassell-dead-trnd/index.html"
Hassel,"i loved SURFACE!  i'm still so pissed off that the show got cancelled on that cliffhanger.  Mr. Hassell dying at such a young age is heartbreaking.  

my condolences to his family & friends."
Hassel,I heard about it Sunday morning from a family friend. Eddie was a great guy with a kind heart. He will definitely be missed
Hassel,Why can't I find his Wikipedia page?
Hassel,"Currently there are four deceased celebrity posts on r/television right now.

All of them passed tragically young.

Sad.

Edit: I did copy and paste this comment to the four different posts. I  hindsight I can see how that would appear insensitive. Nobody had mentioned it in any thread and I was trying to start a discussion about that. I'm going to copy and paste this edit to those four posts because it's an efficient way to explain myself rather than write each one individually. No point in reinventing the wheel."
Hassel,RIP
Hassel,Death comes
Hassel,[removed]
Hassel,He was murdered. Not shot.
Hassel,[deleted]
Hassel,This is my friend's brother. I found out on Google News. Bloody hell.
Hassel,Who?
Hassel,Great show. Wish it had had a conclusion.
Hassel,Yeah I used to live in pricey “luxury” apartments too. As soon as pimps or drug dealers get 10k in their bank account they splurge and move in. Reeeeaaal fun to live next to.
Hassel,[deleted]
Hassel,"You know as well as I do that ""luxury"" apartments means nothing"
Hassel,Yeah that is very random. It’s not a bad part of town at all
Hassel,"Wow, the one with the Whole Foods on its first floor?  Changes the entire mental image of ""shot in apartment complex"""
Hassel,[deleted]
Hassel,"The people complaining about karma whoring might be wanting to sell high karma accounts ;)

It's nice to be reassured that yes, I have read a similar post in the same day."
Hassel,Copy and pasting this in every post is pretty insensitive imo. You really care that much about upvotes?
Hassel,I enjoyed reading this comment in the at least 3 other threads you posted it in. Enjoy your upvotes.
Hassel,Blah blah blah... All that and no list?
Hassel,The ol copy paste for karma while pretending you care? Well done.
Hassel,Or you know you could delete the other ones. Adding the edit to the other posts does absolutely nothing but confirm that you don’t actually care
Hassel,This human being has been shot dead.
Hassel,it's not exclusive
Hassel,"I'm sure you think you're making some sort of point, but all you're doing is appearing to be some sort of moron."
Hassel,"Are you suggesting that he tripped, fell, and landed on the bullet?"
Hassel,[deleted]
Hassel,"What are you even trying to say here, the dude was literally shot in the stomach"
Hassel,"Murder is a legal term. It refers to an ""unlawful"" killing. The news can report that a person was shot, but it's up to courts to decide if that shooting constitutes murder. Otherwise, if one of these cases was ruled in court to be self-defense, the perpetrator could potentially sue the media for defamation.

So yes, he was shot. But for legal purposes, murder has not technically been determined yet."
Hassel,"Oh okay, so apparently if you were murdered that means you can't have been shot."
Hassel,Both.
Hassel,How was he murdered?
Hassel,"Technically, he was shot, which murdered him."
Hassel,"Kind of like when a cop shoots someone in the back the headline reads “projectile from a gun strikes individual, causing to him to cease living, cop heartbroken”"
Hassel,">He's perhaps best known for playing Phil Nance in ""Surface"" for a bunch of episodes. He also starred as Eddie Suarez in ""Devious Maids"" for a bit.
>
Other acting credits include a role in ""The Kids Are All Right,"" ""Family Weekend,"" ""'Til Death,"" and other cameos in a ton of other series and flicks like ""2012,"" ""Longmire,"" ""Jobs,"" ""Bones,"" ""Southland,"" ""Warrior Road,"" ""Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip,"" ""Bomb City,"" and other projects."
Hassel,I hate comments like this.
Hassel,[deleted]
Hassel,"Someone who worked on tv shows. Just because you didn’t know them, doesn’t mean you get to be an asshole about it."
Hassel,Some nobody as far as I can tell
Hassel,He dies. Jesus I hate myself truly.
Hassel,"Sure it does, it means more money!"
Hassel,People are getting ballsy and desperate with COVID. I had to pull my gun on 2 thugs trying to break into my house/car in an area where crime like that is unheard of.
Hassel,"This is what scares me a bit about the US, despite having lived there and loving the place.  In Europe or Australia, you could maybe get jumped for your nice car in a good area by someone with a bat or maybe a knife - but no-one's just going to casually shoot you like this. What a truly awful story..."
Hassel,"I didn't realize that.  Maybe that's why they were trying the ""somewhere in Texas"" thing.  I didn't know anything like that even existed in Grand Prairie."
Hassel,"It might just get deleted. Only 'notable' persons should have a Wikipedia entry.

&#x200B;

Edit: I'm not saying Eddie Hassell isn't notable or that he shouldn't have a Wikipedia entry, I'm just saying some Wikipedia editor may choose to delete it."
Hassel,I edited my comment but I wasn't trying to karma farm.  Nobody had mentioned how there were so many celebrity passings. I wanted to generate that discussion and chose an efficient though tactless way to go about it.
Hassel,"He cares about not being insensitive when he can help it. If other people upvote that behavior, so be it."
Hassel,Not sure why you’re getting downvoted copying and pasting something like this 5 times is pretty wack and cringe.
Hassel,"You definitely shouldn’t be getting downvotes. You’re completely right, OP is an insensitive asshole."
Hassel,The article said he died after the assailant delivered three bullets into the victim’s heart. In the intellectual community we discussed it and have come to the conclusion he was shot.
Hassel,yeah ... thats really strange he had a problem with that . Millennials.....
Hassel,"There's a wierd thing going on where people are trying to seem aware and progressive by asking for words in articles to be harsher. People don't really know why, they just do what they see other people get praised for."
Hassel,"""It wasn't the gun that killed him, it was the murder"""
Hassel,[deleted]
Hassel,[deleted]
Hassel,Nooo he would be older if he was on leave it to beaver....
Hassel,Eddie Hassell married Mildred Hoff. They had a son named David Hassel-Hoff.
Hassel,Oh god don’t say that or you will hurt peoples feelings and get downvoted
Hassel,"""why are we in this hand basket and is it getting warmer?"""
Hassel,Holy shit
Hassel,Should've called social workers instead.
Hassel,"Different cultures, different dangers.  Beheadings seem to be big over in EU right now."
Hassel,"I heard France has a little problem these days, no guns involved."
Hassel,"Australia? Where? From my experience, the Gold Coast was an eye-opener. Casual reporting of murders on the local news happened almost daily from the vicinity that was just mere stops from Surfer’s Paradise!"
Hassel,I know a girl who was an extra once an she legit has an idmb page she didn't even know about. Go outside.
Hassel,Who are the 4?
Hassel,"4 celebrity’s deaths happened close together, what more is there to talk about? You want to have discussion over a coincidence that really isn’t that unusual over having a discussion about any one of the people that died? Really?"
Hassel,[deleted]
Hassel,You are a fucking idiot and a pathetic piece of shit.
Hassel,"It literally says in the title he’s dead. No crucial information is missing. Only someone very, very obtuse wouldn’t make the connection that he died from being shot."
Hassel,"Not OP but I also dislike comments like these, because there is a time and a place for inquiring on someones source of fame, I dont think articles or posts announcing his death are the spot to do so.

A man just died and some people cant even do the decent thing and just google who he is if they are curious. 

Instead some people insist on leaving comments like that on an article or post specifically talking about his death.

Its lazy, and seems purposeful in its insensitivity."
Hassel,"Yeah, that’ll get your blood pumping. Something you’re not hearing on the news. The domestic violence, suicides, assaults, robberies and break-Ins are up everywhere this year."
Hassel,Excuse me? You’re giving me advice on what I should have done when two criminals are attempting to break and enter my home?
Hassel,"I think statistically it's not a big threat, but yeah terrorism is an issue in Europe right now."
Hassel,How many lies and dog whistle racism are you going to shamelessly spew all over reddit?
Hassel,I’m pretty sure a priest just recently got shot in France.
Hassel,"It's astonishing how sensitive some users are about my comment. Just one glance at gun murder statistics would prove I have a point, but here we are..."
Hassel,"Cool. IMDB and Wikipedia are not the same thing though. IMDB seeks to have a page on every movie publically available and everyone who ever has been credited in such a movie. While anyone can create a Wikipedia article, if the subject doesn't meet certain requirements, that article will be deleted eventually."
Hassel,">idmb

That made me smile."
Hassel,"Eddie Hassell, Nikki McGibbin, David Rodriguez, but the only one I know is Nate Burrell from 60 Days In (we get this show in UK)

RIP"
Hassel,It’s funny because you accused him of karma farming but you’re on that downward slope.
Hassel,"The article said murdered with a knife, but I know he was stabbed."
Hassel,"I've gotta say, I read the title and immediately assumed that it may have been an accidental shooting, as it didn't say murdered."
Hassel,[deleted]
Hassel,Woosh
Hassel,"[Truth hurts.](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-54598546)

[Doesn't it?](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-54729957)

[Now, do fuck off.](https://www.startribune.com/report-police-operation-at-vienna-synagogue-shots-fired/572950562/)"
Hassel,They are pretty much the same thing. I can go make a wikipedia page about vuzman right not. That is why your teachers don't like you using wiki as a source. It's a super shitty source.
Hassel,"Weird that both Nikki and Eddie were from Grand Prairie, TX."
Hassel,You really aren’t making sense. What’s the point of your comment? And OP went from having upvotes in the hundreds to going down to 6 so people definitely aren’t a fan even if I’m getting downvoted also.
Hassel,"Why is the article saying he died by being thrown out the window?

Obviously it was the defenstration that killed him."
Hassel,">I legitimately don't care that he died. 

Do you care who he is? If you only care now that he has died, googling who he was would be a lot quicker than asking reddit.

Either way, if you dont care, dont comment."
Hassel,You do care. You commented. If you did not you would have scrolled past the article and web on with your day
Hassel,[deleted]
Hassel,Not everybody keeps up with the happenings around here.
Hassel,"They aren't and they just explained why, lol. Also what you're saying is besides the point and only helping their argument. A wikipedia article can be a super shitty source because some random person made one with wrong or insufficient information, same reason it'd be deleted by an editor. IMDB is factual information on anyone part of any production that is meant to be a record no matter how inconsequential."
Alex,"I don't know about this. The movie was perfect so the bar is already set really high for the series to do it justice.

However, the Gattaca universe has always been a great premise so if they explore other characters and aspects of it, it could have potential. I guess we'll have to wait and see."
Alex,"Watched this in 7th grade when learning about DNA, coolest fucking class movie ever"
Alex,"A somewhat timely revival, since the world is on the cusp of a revolution in genetic editing and cell manipulation thanks to advances in Crispr and RNA editing."
Alex,"I'd feel a lot better about this if Andrew Niccol were involved, given that he both wrote and directed *Gattaca.*"
Alex,GATTACA is legit my favorite movie and I am both scared and excited for this.
Alex,GATTACA
Alex,I loved this movie.
Alex,"If the title screen for this show isn't Jason Mantzoukas yelling ""Gattaca,"" I don't want it."
Alex,"*Homeland co-creators/executive producers Howard Gordon and Alex Gansa are plotting a return to Showtime with Gattaca, a series based on the 1997 movie of the same name. Details are not confirmed as deals for the project, from Sony Pictures Television, are still being finalized. Written by Gordon, Gansa and Craig Borten, the series takes place a generation after the events of the film, when science and humanity have evolved to the point where we can direct our own evolution. Genetic engineering has created a world in which parents can determine the future of their children before they are born (the Valids), which by default has created a new underclass, no longer determined by social status or the color of one’s skin (the Invalids).*

Sounds good to me! Loved Gattaca and would happily watch a sequel. The creators have good pedigree and the studio is a top class one. Plenty of reasons for optimism."
Alex,He never saved anything for the swim back
Alex,I'm always up for some serious science fiction. This is one of my favorite films. Seeing more of that world shouldn't be a bad thing. *Shouldn't.*
Alex,Don’t fuck it up please.
Alex,Such a great and underrated movie! I hope this is good
Alex,"Fuck, this universe was so cool. 

Please don't mess this up or retell the same story."
Alex,Oh no.
Alex,"The music in the movie was pivotal, hope they can get Michael Nyman’s involvement"
Alex,I'm here for it. Please be good tho.
Alex,Cautiouly excited. There is a lot of potential in the Gattaca universe and i'm very interested in it. Hopefully Showtime doesnt screw this.
Alex,"I'll watch this regardless how bad it is. If it drives more people to watch the movie, that'll be enough to justify the series (easy for me to say cuz it isn't my money lol)

But I'm worried about what more they could have to say beyond what the movie covers. I mean, there could be some cute anecdotes (like the piano piece that requires 6 fingers to play). It could also just be a generic story told in this setting as an excuse to get these ideas out in the general consciousness."
Alex,I was a fan of this film so I'm pleased to see this
Alex,"In theory, a show about Gattaca is not the worst idea in the world.

But there's like a 50/50 chance they add some kind of underground resistance plot to it, which would suck."
Alex,"Just so you know, right handed guys pee while holding it with their right hand"
Alex,I hope they don’t save anything for the swim back making this show.
Alex,Great movie that very few people IRL seem to have seen
Alex,Fun fact: the name GATTACA is a DNA sequence. 🧬
Alex,Raffi would be so happy
Alex,"cool news, I must get drunk immediately!"
Alex,Can they not? Can they just leave good things alone
Alex,"The movie was terrific and while it's odd saying this about a sci-fi movie, it was ahead of its time and was out of place for a 90s movie.  It's something that probably would have been a megahit if it came out in the 2010s."
Alex,How about they just write something new
Alex,Fucking come up with some original ideas without ruining something perfect! This is what happens when old Hollywood money tries to tay relevant. Make way for a new generation of creators you sad old motherfuckers!
Alex, “I never saved anything for the swim back.” One of my all time fav movie quotes.
Alex,"Nice, excited to see the story before they built the Battlestar"
Alex,I understand there is a universe there but I don't understand wtf a show would be about
Alex,"Make something original!!!!!!!

Good grief this is all so frustrating…."
Alex,"I cant wait til they make a really decent, nostalgic series that I can get attached CC to so they can cancel it after one season"
Alex,"Another addition to the modern state of unoriginality in television. It’s incredible how many new shows are a continuation from a movie/show from the 70s, 80s, and 90s."
Alex,"This is a long-shot, but hear me out. What if they remake Gattaca (1997), but….you gender-swap the roles. Boom: This time it’s a woman who is afflicted with the inferior genetics in an unfair future world that attempts to fulfill their dream.  


Need more? She’s bi-sexual, perhaps both main characters are female……..and both are not white.  


Alright, now where’s my lucrative development deal with a major streamer: My idea’s are a slam dunk."
Alex,"Great, let's see how they weave in the woke agenda and ruin another well liked IP."
Alex,"Please, please, please don't make it woke as fuck. I loved the movie, don't ruin this one as well."
Alex,I’d be down for this. This was such an underrated and excellent film.
Alex,"One of my favorite movies, I hope they don't fuck this up!"
Alex,Wait why
Alex,Had never heard of the movie until I had to watch it for a film class last fall. Amazing film. I think there was definitely some missed opportunities with the film that a TV show could definitely take.
Alex,"This is one of my favourite films. From the article:

> Set in the near future where corporations screen their employees based on their genetic makeup, the series centers on a man with a congenital heart condition who tries to assume the identity of a former athlete with perfect genes in order to fulfill his dream of traveling in space.

It sounds like they're just re-telling the same story as the film? But spreading it out over X number of seasons? Fuck that."
Alex,"“That guy’s playing Gattaca. He didn’t think we’d notice, but I did”"
Alex,"this could be very interesting, such a cool world."
Alex,One of my favorite movies. Shared with my teens recently & they loved it. I thought the story was fascinating & before it’s time. Was awesome to point out their daughter is one of my kids favorite characters on Stranger Things. Hope they don’t fuck up the series bc there’s already a very high standard this movie set.
Alex,No wearing 3 piece suits into space again please.  I still couldn’t get over the ridiculousness of that final scene in the movie.
Alex,"This was the first movie I know of that I was too young and immature to appreciate when I watched it. As a tween I hated it often cited it as one of the worst movies ever because I was expecting Sci fi adventure, not a slow burn intellectual thriller.

I just wanted to get that off my chest and apologize to all the people behind gattaca, for all the mean things I said to my friends about your movie. And thank you for not making a movie that appealed to my idiot 11 year old self and instead making something mature and thoughtful."
Alex,One of my favorite movies. I’m excited but oh so nervous it will not live up to the movie.
Alex,Fingers crossed that the soundtrack is up to par with the movies…
Alex,Great movie. I'm cautiously excited.
Alex,"Actually could have a lot of potential as a TV show.  On one hand worried because the movie is singularly excellent, but conceptually the story and universe has outstanding potential for a longer format television series."
Alex,What I think is one of the greatest Sci-Fi movies of our generation. Please don’t ruin it with a show.
Alex,https://youtu.be/jeip-0sUt78?t=34

More instances of when it's being discussed someone will go ""UHM...but *Gattaca*?!?"" as if a fictional depiction had any weight as an argument."

Alex,"That's what I'm hoping, don't retell the movie and I'll be interested."
Alex,"My all time favourite film, going to cross my fingers here."
Alex,I mean they basically elevated **An Interview with a Vampire** so I am sure good writers could do the same for **Gattaca**. Then again the opposite is true for so many movie to TV adaptations. I suppose having a book as the real inspiration is what worked for AIWAV.
Alex,“WhAT’s yOuR NuMbAhhh?!”
Alex,"As long as Alex Kurtzman doesn't direct it, we should be relativly safe."

Alex,"My English class was supposed to watch Revenge of the Sith, but then the Sandy Hook shooting happened and the teacher decided it probably wasn't a good idea to show a movie with a scene where schoolchildren are slaughtered the same week that a school shooting took place 30 minutes away. So we watched GATTACA instead.

So, my experience with GATTACA is slightly tainted by that, but it's a great movie."
Alex,"Even neater was learning about DNA and base pairs at the same time and suddenly realizing the movie title was just a DNA sequence, my teenage mind was blown"
Alex,"It's been so long since I've seen the movie, but I half remember thinking .. well when you take away the follow your dreams fluff, weren't they kind of in the right barring him from being a space pilot? I mean if you have a genetic condition that could cause you to keel over at any moment you should not be piloting a craft full of people. We already have health and fitness requirements for pilots, I'm pretty sure someone like that would already be barred from the profession even without the genetic discrimination.

Probably could have picked a more sympathetic example, unless the point was to show it's not so cut and dry. Fuck,, now I need to re-watch the movie."
Alex,Yeah thats why this is a great IP to iterate further on imo. Movie was so far ahead of its time and ended up looking pretty prescient in a lot of ways. Every chance this sucks mad shit but the bones of something really good are there too.
Alex,"That would be an interesting angle, especially since the show takes place a generation after the events in *Gattaca*

The technology in the movie didn’t use gene editing though. I saw it at a screening when it first came out where Niccols did a Q&A after. He corrected an audience member who mentioned “genetic engineering”, and explained it was genetic selection. Avery Brooks’ character explains the process in the movie. 

At the time, I thought that didn’t sound right because of the piano player with multiple fingers. But I’ve since learned that polydactylism is a recessive trait that can be selected for."
Alex,RNA editing is not relevant to this.
Alex,"Niccol also wrote and directed In Time so... Gordon and Gansa are solid writers, it could be good."
Alex,"Same, the danger of this series soiling the original material are high, but at the same time the chance to have more gattaca lore and world building on the screen is very enticing 

Please be good"
Alex,"Still love how they only used G,T,C,A for the title/company"
Alex,Love. Please don't use past tense.
Alex,"Mix this with Bladerunner where it’s engineered cops having to learn to deal with Invalids they don’t have any empathy for, and I’m in.

Rehash another mission to Jupiter and I’m out."
Alex,Yeah. I’m thinking this is a Hollywood Studio Combo #1 order: A large generic TV series with a side of appropriated franchise and characters.
Alex,"It's Showtime. Where the glory days of SF shows were *Stargate SG-1* and *Jeremiah.*  Just me, I'd dial expectations down to slightly above [*Man Who Fell to Earth*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqM5UeQVRvI) levels.  :D"
Alex,"lmao it won't be. And in 8 years when season 7 is airing, assuming you're still alive you'll realize the IP was better left alone."
Alex,No they will add some social justice bullshit to it and invert the entire concept and message
Alex,There's something timelines about it.
Alex,"The same thing as the movie but longer and more drawn out. At the end the message will be that invalids are also 'valid' and can overcome the odds, just like in the movie, but probably more hamfisted."
Alex,Seek help
Alex,There are plenty of other shows for you to watch. This won't ruin your enjoyment of the movie.
Alex,"Plenty of original shows succession , stranger things , black mirror , love death and robots , ozark , squid game , white lotus I believe is an original series , abbot elementary , the rehearsal , Barry , Ted lasso , maybe they have a good idea here let’s wait until we see a trailer"
Alex,"It's not paranoia, it's has potentially horrific consequences"
Alex,They say in the second paragraph of the linked article the series takes place a generation after the events of the film so this is a sequel series.
Alex,"It'll be a good excuse to bring back [Dean Norris's character as a cop.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nuJpha7NqI) 

That'll definitely get me more interested in watching."

Conspiracy of Silence,"> Sources say HBO pitched the estate on retelling Middle-earth’s “Third Age” — essentially remaking Peter Jackson’s beloved Lord of the Rings trilogy, which grossed $3 billion and won 11 Oscars. The estate has its gripes with Jackson’s adaptations (the late Christopher Tolkien, the author’s son, said they “eviscerated” the books) but wasn’t interested in treading the same ground. Netflix pitched doing several shows, such as a Gandalf series and an Aragorn drama. “They took the Marvel approach,” said one insider to the talks, “and that completely freaked out the estate.”

It's quite interesting that HBO basically wanted to remake the original trilogy and Netflix wanted a cinematic universe out of it.

> Amazon’s team (at the time led by Albert Chang, Sharon Tal Yguado and Dan Scharf) wooed the estate not with a specific pitch, but with a pledge of a close relationship that would give the estate a creative seat at the table so it could protect Tolkien’s legacy. There was also, of course, the money. Sources say the staggering number that’s been widely reported ($250 million) was actually Netflix’s bid and that Amazon’s number was tens of millions less (albeit, still staggering). “It was our collective passion and fidelity to Tolkien that really won the day,” says Amazon Studios TV co-head Vernon Sanders.

Also interesting that it was actually Netflix that won the bidding war (an information we did not know before I think) but The Estate wanted to go with Prime Video for creative preference."
Conspiracy of Silence,"> At one point, Payne and McKay asked mentor and former boss J.J. Abrams to call Amazon to put in a good word, and he did. “We feel like that moved the needle,” says McKay.

Are they admitting to nepotism here? That honestly explains a lot.

> “There are things that didn’t work as well in season one that might have worked in a smaller show,” McKay agrees. “It has to be about good and evil and the fate of the world or it doesn’t have that epic feeling you want when you’re in Tolkien.”

I think this quote clearly shows a misunderstanding between the actual criticisms of the show and what the showrunners think people are criticizing. People arent mad that its “slow” or about it being specifically one thing, its just poorly executed. The character development isnt slow, its nonexistent. Almost every character is bland and shallow. They act in ways that are incoherent or unintentional to what the writers wanted for the character. The world bends so that necessary conflicts happen, instead of them occurring naturally as part of the story. This isnt something that magically gets fixed with a smaller budget. Its a core issue that no one on the team seems to get. They just chalk it down to “trolls.”"

Conspiracy of Silence,">“It was never about the critics, it’s all about consumers,” the insider says. “All Jeff cares about is consumer obsession. If you look at the history of Amazon, every division lived and died based on that … Dragon matters because all of a sudden there is a benchmark. It is their closest comp to success. When they saw Dragon grew in its second episode and brought in 20 million viewers, they were shitting their pants.”

By this account the show has failed in the eyes of the creators in my local circle.

I'm already 2 episodes behind, and like 3 tomorrow, meanwhile me and the missus sit down every Monday so ready for what's next in HotD.

I sense the same around the office as well. There is a lot more organic conversation about Dragons than Rings. And the conversations always start with Dragons and eventuelly end up on Rings and simply whether people have watched the last episode and if it's any good."

Conspiracy of Silence,"“You have to pitch all five seasons”,  LOL! I can’t believe they just started filming season two!"
Conspiracy of Silence,"The scale of this show just makes absolutely NO sense. There’s a handful of orcs. The south lands is shown to be a couple of villages. Numenor sends 500 soldiers. They keep trying to make it seem like the stakes are SO HIGH, but everything seems so small"
Conspiracy of Silence,"Two words come t mind when I think about this show:

Gorgeous- every single scene is really extraordinary.lighting, saturation, framing, scope, focus.  You can pick a random time stamp and have a promotional still as good as most movies or book covers.

Mediocre- everything else is so “just okay” I keep falling asleep trying to watch this show.  It just doesn’t keep my attention. 

A friend described it as hours of playing magic the gathering and no one wins. She was right."
Conspiracy of Silence,"The stakes doesn't have to be huge , it's just I don't connect with the characters and I don't care about them. I like Elrond and Durin's dynamic , I don't care for the Southlanders or Numenor. Okay show overall..."

Conspiracy of Silence,"Season 1 so far has been very flat, and so unbelievably average, its left me rather deflated. The no.1 thing the showrunners need to work on is the writing. Characters need to make decisions that make sense. Timelines need to make sense. Travel distance needs to be a thing. Look at LOTR and the Hobbit, both convey how long it takes to get somewhere, but in ROP characters just use quick-travel. Also the main character shouldn't be a total insufferable dickhead. I really really hope they step it up for season 2, because it has the potential of a great show, it just feels like its being wasted by bad writers."
Conspiracy of Silence,"""The guys with perhaps the least experience were also the best choice.""

Experience isn't everything. But the first season of an expensive show should avoid being too complex, so people can learn on the job."
Conspiracy of Silence,"> Criticism they can handle, and they’ve heard it all. Everything fans have debated, they say, they likewise argued among the creative team. **They readily admit, for instance, that some of the first-season episodes lack the urgency fans expect from Tolkien adaptations**.

> “One of the big things we learned was **even when it’s a small scene, it always has to tie back into the larger stakes**,” Payne says.

> “There are things that didn’t work as well in season one that might have worked in a smaller show,” McKay agrees. “It has to be about good and evil and the fate of the world or it doesn’t have that epic feeling you want when you’re in Tolkien.”

> **Which doesn’t mean the show won’t continue to embrace small moments**. They point out that in The Return of the King, Sam sees a star through the clouds and says all the evil they’re facing is but a passing shadow, and there’s beauty above that it can never reach. “It’s a tiny personal moment, but it reflects the theme of the entire work,” Payne notes. And even the show’s loudest critics admit the series looks beautiful and does a fine job of creating and appreciating the wonders of Tolkien’s world.

I like that they will try to focus on more cohesive through-lines to the main plot in the second season, as it's probably my main criticism of the show at the moment. Some scenes / moments feel like they plod along without much connectivity to the whole.

All in all, I think Season 1 was a strong effort out of the gate that was never going to live up to fans expectations lets face those facts. 

All that PR about how much money they spent and how expensive the show was to produce also didn't help any because it just raised those expectations even higher for non-fans too.

Will be interested to see how Season 1 ends, and where they take Season 2."
Conspiracy of Silence,I really tried to get into RoP but it feels so lifeless. After a few eps I realised that watching it was now on my chores list rather than something I looked forward to. I hope it picks up because I love the overall world and the look of the show.
Conspiracy of Silence,"“McKay has an extraordinary level of energy and passion, and when he’s in full pitch, he’s as persuasive as a Middle-earth-obsessed Saul Goodman — you find yourself nodding in agreement, suddenly wanting to buy property in Mirkwood.”

If the writer of the show is compared to Saul Goodman, a man best known to be an unscrupulous, lying, cheating bastard who is willing to do anything to tip odds in his favor, it’s not a compliment. It’s fine if you’re portraying someone like that on tv, because we all know it’s fictional. But if you’re like that in real live, it means you’re an awful human being.

But at least it explains how the series turned out like it did."
Conspiracy of Silence,"Bruh they just teleport from open seas to some seemingly tiny out of the way countryside village right at the exact second they were needed.

Forget the urgency, LOTR is about a journey, an odyssey, they literally cut that out of this show. Except for the scant scenes of Galadriel travelling with the other elves in ep 1, which I think is narratively the most interesting part."
Conspiracy of Silence,I consistently see people complain about the quality of writing in this show. The article doesn't even touch on that but does spend most of its bandwidth talking about people complaining about strong woman and black elf. Its the same marketing technique over and over again.
Conspiracy of Silence,"It's not plot driven, character driven, world driven, emotionally driven, strong acting driven...

All of those are due to 1 group....get new writers.  The other will fix if you give the actors good material.  There is no way this batch of writers are somehow gonna realize what a good scene is, they haven't figured a single one out in the five episodes I watched. 

I really wanted to like it to shut up those damn YouTubers bitching about the casting and such.  But man...it's crazy how MEH this show is considering how good it could be."
Conspiracy of Silence,"My experience so far is that while the show has been carried well by some of the actors' performances, like Durin and Elrond, I have been disappointed with Galadriel. I find her insufferable and one dimensional, and that sucks because she is supposed to be the protagonist. 
The visuals have been beautiful and breathtaking, but it all feels so derivative and simply window dressing on a mediocre level of storytelling.
I want to care about the characters. I want the show to succeed.
But so far it's been a giant meh."
Conspiracy of Silence,this show is such a disappointment. Not awful. Not good. Just meh.
Conspiracy of Silence,The Tolkien Estate is full of god damn idiots that allow this to happen. But I guess they are happy about the money
Conspiracy of Silence,"I feel like this article is a bit of a shill piece for the show. They are still on the “review bombing” thing which, sure definitely happened to an extent…but we are way past that now and the proof is in the pudding - everyone is watching the same show. 

The scores on Rotten Tomatoes and IMDB (owned by amazon) are hardly trust worthy and the KPIs that are getting spun positively are just kinda desperate at this point with some non-comprehensive Nielson data. Not to say its launch wasn’t pretty strong but in comparison to other things its not the monumental success I think Amazon wanted it to be.

Other media outlets like Forbes have come to terms with the fact that it’s actually just a mid at best show regardless of the gloss and LotR IP - they are writing scathing but fair reviews of the show that have nothing to do with the hateful trolls from the goblin caves."
Conspiracy of Silence,"I can totally appreciate Christopher's reaction to the adaptations. The man was devoted to his father and his work and legacy. He spent his whole life collaborating with his father and worked on it for years after he died.

Now... I loved the PJ movies. Best adaptation that you could hope for given the medium of film.

It's just funny that the estate had all these options and Rings is the result.

It's an objectively mediocre show. Not terrible, not great. It's mediocre. It's a damn shame.

I can't wait for the day until it becomes public domain and the estate can fuck off. 

I still say they should have done an anthology series."

Conspiracy of Silence,"Episode 6 was the one which really make me think this show is quite poor. 

One scene Galad is talking to that failed sailor boy guy and the boy reveals he's just a stable hand.  
Next time we see him he's in armour, fighting, leading a charge even.   
Nevermind that one second it's midnight and the next it's daylight... in the same scene!  
Or how dark elf goes to hide the sword  and wow, the one person he should hide it from saw him hide it.   
Oh but then the boy saves the day by giving away the sword,   
Oh but it's not the sword and literally no one bothered to check.  
Oh the sword is actually a key.   
Oh the key causes a volcano to explode.   
Oh people are literally running *towards* the exploding volcano.  
Oh Galad is just standing there doing nothing while people are dying.  

I could easily list another dozen things. It was so bad."
Conspiracy of Silence,"Reminder, Amazon waiting until Christopher Tolkien died before making their announcements about the wildly lore breaking changes they were intending…

If they thought Jackson’s movies were “too action orientated” and “

How do you think they’d feel about Galadriel: Wire Fu Warrior Princess along with all of the other bullshit? 

RoP is not just terrible lore wise, it’s just plain bad. Worst of all, it’s dreadfully boring and no shoe horned in , terribly CGI bloated action sequences can fix that."
Conspiracy of Silence,"I don’t understand, they (Tolkien estate) went with Amazon to have a sit a the creative table, which I guess was to make a show more faithful to Tolkien’s work.

But then they introduced and change thing from the book to the point that this show is basically a fan fiction at this point.

They hated the movie adaptation so bad that they went with Amazon bid (which was much less than Netflix) because they wanted to make a faithful adaptation and THIS is their definition of a faithful work ?
A timeline that doesn’t exist ?

> Trying to convince executives to bank on two guys with zero IMDb credits instead of proven Hollywood hitmakers was no easy task. “The people we were up against have résumés that on paper would be more suited to the gig,” McKay says. “We were the dark horse candidates.”

> At one point, Payne and McKay asked mentor and former boss J.J. Abrams to call Amazon to put in a good word, and he did. “We feel like that moved the needle,” says McKay.

Ya think?

> Yet Amazon has long known they were in for a rather bumpy series takeoff. They saw Tolkien fans slamming The Rings of Power online before a frame had been released.

Yes, because you leaked what we were to expect before a single frame had been released. Don't act stupid.

> “Having insight into our global audience, we also have insight into the darker sides of how people can manipulate reviews and have other points of view that we wouldn’t support.”

Or maybe your audience isn't manipulating the reviews and are actually offering their sincere opinions about the show. What a world we live in where the mega-corporation can get away with openly complaining about the consumer to their face. Who gives a shit about your point of view? Make a product that consumers want, and you won't have consumers leaving negative reviews.

> So the streamer announced it was switching off reviews of the show on its platform for its first 72 hours after its premiere (then kept them off for an additional five days). The company continued to monitor reviews: Some vanished so fast, it’s like they were wearing the One Ring.

Speaking of manipulating reviews... Absolutely disgusting. Mega-corporation manipulates criticism of its product, and The Hollywood Reporter makes a cute joke. Wonder how many other product reviews Amazon is manipulating.

> Amazon claims there’s been a coordinated effort to attack the show for daring to diversify Tolkien with strong female characters and people of color. 

Fans weren't attacking the show for daring to diversify. Tolkien's work already has diversity. Fans were attacking nonsensical alternations to the source material. Had the showrunners used the diversity already present in Tolkien's work without shoehorning their own wonky concepts, fans would have readily accepted it.

> Tolkien’s world has a long, unfortunate history of attracting fascist-adjacent admirers, something that surely would have repulsed the fantasy world’s anti-totalitarian author, whose Rings trilogy was inspired by the horrors of World War I. Italy’s newly elected far-right nationalist leader, Giorgia Meloni, for example, has been an outspoken Tolkien fan, unhelpfully.

What a goofy paragraph. The vast majority of people disappointed with the show, and leaving bad reviews have nothing to do with the dopey uber-fringe, racist Neo-Nordic types that have attached themselves to Tolkien's mythology. That group is so miniscule they barely make a blip. And the fact that a right-leaning Italian PM likes a book rooted in English and Nordic mythology is about as relevant as telling us that she's also a fan of Harry Potter.

> Or take this fan’s complaint: A Tolkien adaptation is a “New Age politically correct girl-power garbage version of fantasy” that’s “raping the text.” That sounds like what’s populating Rotten Tomatoes and IMDb right now, but it was actually quoted in Wired magazine in 2001 for a story about Tolkien fandom’s reaction to Jackson’s The Fellowship of the Ring.

Oh wow. [They dug through old Wired magazine articles](https://techgnosis.com/fellowship-of-the-ring/) to find a quote from the one Tolkien purist that Wired themselves describes as ""the most notorious single Purist on the Net."" If you dig hard enough you can find the one contrarian on the internet for every piece of fiction that's ever been created. The uproar over Rings of Power is not quite the same thing as ""Kelannar from Tolkien Online"" c. 2005.

> Payne looks particularly distressed by the topic. “The spirit of Tolkien is about disparate peoples who don’t trust one another and look different from one another finding common ground in friendship and accomplishing big things,” he says. “That’s the spirit we’ve tried to inculcate into every single comma and period in the show. That this aspiration would be offensive to people and enrage them … it’s very hard for us to understand. What are they protecting?

Oh stop with the wide-eyed innocent act. What a load of nonsense. Peter Jackson said the following about making Lord of the Rings, ""We made a promise to ourselves at the beginning of the process that we weren't going to put any of our own politics, our own messages or our own themes into these movies. In a way, we were trying to make these films for him (Tolkien), not for ourselves."" You did the exact opposite, and you know it."
Conspiracy of Silence,The article made me vomit. “This isn’t a cash grab. It’s a labor of love.” 🤮
Conspiracy of Silence,"I can't wait 'til we get to episode seven where the Southlanders and Númenóreans >!will survive the same sort of 1300 degree pyroclastic flow that turned the citizens of Pompeii into statues, frozen in deathly horror. It'll be the single greatest act of plot armor by way of bad writing the world has ever seen!< and we'll be here for it. These are truly wonderous times we live in."
Conspiracy of Silence,"The last House of the Dragon episode had a funeral scene, and although it wasn't long, there was so much more finesse and storytelling skill within that funeral than in most of the RoP first season.

It's just baffling how much better House of the Dragon is."
Conspiracy of Silence,"on the topic of the cinematic universes, I feel its probably the only way to really go in depth for a lot of these events/characters without simply glossing over them in an entire show.

It would be cool to see and I guess the estate doesn't like any idea of this which is a tragedy because i think it would be very well done."
Conspiracy of Silence,"The Hollywood reporter, really?? Can’t have a more biased shilling medium than them."
Conspiracy of Silence,"I like the show, it’s been a bit slow but it does enough right to keep me invested. Hopefully next season they hear the criticism and get things rolling a little quicker."
Conspiracy of Silence,">Or take this fan’s complaint: A Tolkien adaptation is a “New Age   
politically correct girl-power garbage version of fantasy” that’s   
“raping the text.” That sounds like what’s populating Rotten Tomatoes   
and IMDb right now, but it was actually quoted in Wired magazine in 2001 for a story about Tolkien fandom’s reaction to Jackson’s The Fellowship of the Ring.

Nothing has changed."
Conspiracy of Silence,"Good show, not great.

Something’s missing though, and I can’t quite put my finger on it."
Conspiracy of Silence,Maybe they should remake the Hobbit.. I mean if they are gonna be made about Peter Jackson gutting something.
Conspiracy of Silence,"These idiots need to stop running their cunt mouths and go back to research how to structure a story. Then how a show should be paced, edited, how dialogue should be written. Claiming something is ""patently evil"" to try and drum up articles from the access media is pathetic and a good indicator of how this steaming pile is performing."
Conspiracy of Silence,“Patently evil”. Buckle up.
Conspiracy of Silence,"“We had reached a point — we’d been writing movies for 10 years that should have gotten made,” McKay says. “Movies where the director was right, the cast was right, the script was right, the title was right and it was a big IP — and it still wasn’t happening. So [we thought] maybe we should try this TV thing.”

Probably because they were actually shit? No?

Edit: to clarify, I believe yeah they were probably shit."
Conspiracy of Silence,">At one point, Payne and McKay asked mentor and former boss J.J. Abrams to call Amazon to put in a good word, and he did. “We feel like that moved the needle,” says McKay. 

Wahoo! Nepotism!!"
Conspiracy of Silence,"Huh interesting that Netflix did outbid them.... Netflix probably would have run it to the ground tbh

Of the ideas amazon's is probably the best.wish hbo did a different pitch and got ten the rights instead I'd only to see what Rory would do with it...but they may well have a large fantasy universe going soon with asoiaf/game of thrones. They should try to get a big Sci fi show going."
Conspiracy of Silence,"Season 2? LOL!   
We're gonna need a bigger moat!"
Conspiracy of Silence,"woof, this is pretty fluffy."
Conspiracy of Silence,"This is the kind of articles that put the entire journalism universe under doubts… RoP is plainly bad and such article can only be paid for by Amazon.
Prime has been doing a lot of good things (The Boys is just amazing) but RoP is probably the worst quality for budget we have seen since The Last Jedi and because a small minority of people bashed the série for black dwarves it looks like we are not allowed to say the truth."
Conspiracy of Silence,Why is there never positive review bombing? Review bombing is always an excuse for bad reviews only.
Conspiracy of Silence,They lost me when the men had a trump rally about the elves stealing their jobs
Conspiracy of Silence,This article is pathetic and so transparent. Glad to hear they are paying attention to house of the dragon because that show is so much better than rings of power that it is actually funny
Conspiracy of Silence,"This article just proves how out of touch they are. All they had to do was make a show that didn’t suck and completely destroy Tolkien’s legacy and Shit all over his work. Even if they don’t have a clue how to honor his legacy the story, writing, and acting are just awful. The one shining light in it is the special effects and landscape so at least they devoted a whole conference room to that!"
Conspiracy of Silence,">“Some of what’s been hardest to hear is the cynical point of view that this is a cash grab,

Of course it's a cash-grab lmfao, if it wasn't they wouldn't have created a show while not having the rights to 70% of the material that occurs within the show. They're either lying or delusional.

&#x200B;

>Prime Video, along with every other entertainment company, was looking for “the next Game of Thrones.” Amazon’s founder and chairman, Jeff Bezos, was a longtime Tolkien fan.

Wonder if the shills will now stop telling people not to compare the dumpsterfire that is RoP to HoTD..

&#x200B;

This entire article is really just a massive fluff piece lol."
Conspiracy of Silence,"they double down on criticism. also with media critic and blog out of touch and never dare talk about the quality, they are on high ground. 
yikes, this is why got mediocre adaptation fantasy lately. Witcher season 2 is downgrade than season 1 cos same reason, out of touch showrunner. Now wheel of time and ROP, will follow same fate. They never learn..

at least there is HoTD and Shadow and Bone that I like. Oh, and Arcane, to fulfill my fantasy.."
Conspiracy of Silence,"Article:

>  J.R.R. Tolkien passion project and have now found themselves, as McKay puts it, “on the fault line of the culture war,” with everybody from armies of anonymous Tolkien fans to the two richest men in the world weighing in. It ain’t easy to focus on writing scripts and managing a cast and crew of 1,300 on the most complicated TV production of all time when Elon Musk is slagging you on Twitter.

They are blaming the fans and Elon for not liking their shitty show. 

Article continues:

> “It was our collective passion and fidelity to Tolkien that really won the day,” says Amazon Studios TV co-head Vernon Sanders

You won a lot of criticism.  Congratulations!   

It gets worse...

> “The entire making of this show has been a massive learning experience for everyone involved. We had no idea what we were getting into. No one else did, either.”

More accurate: ""We had no idea what we were doing.  Most everyone knew it from watching the show."""
Conspiracy of Silence,"They made the right choice. Another Lord of the Rings would be redundant, even if it's more faithful than the movies. A ""Middle Earth Cinematic Universe"" is a horrible idea, and would do more to shit on Tolkien's legacy than any poor adaptation could.

Like it or hate it, Rings of Power is the best option. Creative control AND inspiration from source material, rather than marketing profit. This is a great thing."
Conspiracy of Silence,This show stinks just on a basic storytelling and TV show level.
Conspiracy of Silence,"I only watch this show to hang out with friends, and even then, we are often not paying attention to """"""important"""""" dialogue and cringing at characters that have no reason for us to care about them. They lack movie basics like save the cat and pope in the pool. Galadriel is still the worst fucking character I've seen in modern media, and that's because I am a absolute whore for warrior lady tropes. She has no personality and absolutely nothing likeable besides trying to look badass all the time. Blergh.

But as long as there are people that will consume a bad piece of media because it belongs to a saga or world they are familiar with regardless of quality, they will keep doing it. It's cheaper and safer."
Conspiracy of Silence,I can’t believe this show was able to get a second season
Conspiracy of Silence,"I was with it until they showed how Mt Doom was made 

And as much as they want me to care about Galadriel’s storyline, I just don’t. It sucks so hard."
Conspiracy of Silence,">They plan to introduce more iconic locations, familiar Middle-earth characters and **a massive two-episode battle**

Please, god, no. All action sequences thus far have been abysmal, namely:

* >!the escape attempt from the trench!<
* >!Galadriel's prison escape!<
* >!episode 6 as whole!<

Actions sequances really aren't their forte, and I feel like battles are not what the franchise is about."
Conspiracy of Silence,What I’m pissed at and they didnt address is why are all the make elves so ugly??? Hello is it too much to get one single hot elf?  Wtf is this
Conspiracy of Silence,[deleted]
Conspiracy of Silence,This show sucks
Conspiracy of Silence,Show looks nice but is as boring as bat shit
Conspiracy of Silence,It isn’t the overt woke-ism that is killing this show - it’s that it’s incredibly boring.
Conspiracy of Silence,"they still running on the racial/gender backlash that has long been replaced by actual backlash focused on pacing, character development, structure, dialogue and directing? lol, how convenient. And how hypocritical they are, sad victims of manipulative reviews, when that's exactly what they've been doing: manipulating outlets, comments and reviews since day one. 

&#x200B;

truly, this show and Amazon are the trainwreck that keeps on giving"
Conspiracy of Silence,Hmm
Conspiracy of Silence,Based on quotes they took criticism better than the horrendous Wheel of time showrunner.  It's really unlikely that bad writers can magically get their act together though.
Conspiracy of Silence,"Good show, nice story, insanely good visuals, some sketchy CGI monsters (the Warg, i’m looking at you, you devilish chihuahua) and terrible writing. 

When I mean Writing, i really mean the dialogue. Sometimes, the lines are very well crafted, and are super beautiful, but most of the time, they’re extremely cringy, and almost feel like a parody of people trying to sound tolkenian.
-the sea is always right
-Halbrand: why are you fighting? Galadriel: because i cannot stop.
- Everything Bronwyn says
- the “All Hail the King” moment 
- etc"
Conspiracy of Silence,Horrible casting imo. At least for the main chick.
Conspiracy of Silence,"Goddamnit we could’ve had an HBO remake of the original trilogy instead of this wank.

I wanna be in THAT timeline."
Conspiracy of Silence,"I've watched and rewatched LotR so many times. Tried to enjoy The Hobbit, but had to limp over the finish line with the third movie, only revisiting it to see the extended edition scenes and endure the worst Wilhelm Scream in existence.

I was prepared to give Rings of Power a shot out of love for LotR, but so much of the PR campaign for the show being based around implying people who have a problem with anything involved in the show being racist, sexist or fascist just made me check out without seeing a single episode, waiting until the season fully aired to see the full reviews before committing to it.

Seems like I made the right decision.

Speaking of race, House of the Dragon sorted that out by making it so that there was an entire family line that was black, rather than making the whole world a modern day melting pot of white, black, asian, hispanic, etc. That seemed a pretty good way to handle things. How does Rings of Power handle it? Are there different lines of dwarves and elves that are of different skin colors, or is everyone cast race blind in this?"
Conspiracy of Silence,"I want very much want to love this show. For that to happen, I need to love the characters, at least some of them. I plan to give the writers every opportunity to get me there but desperately hope it doesn’t turn out to be all fore-play with no happy endings."
Conspiracy of Silence,I wish I had never found out that HBO's remake of LOTR was passed over for the dumpster fire that is RoP. WHY?!?!?!?!
Conspiracy of Silence,So everyone that doesn't like it for any reason is a hater? That is thier answer.
Conspiracy of Silence,Crazy that Netflix really thought their high school film crew was gonna earn this.
Conspiracy of Silence,"Sincere question:

How the fuck is Galadriel still alive?"
Conspiracy of Silence,">They saw Tolkien fans slamming The Rings of Power online before  
 a frame had been released. “We all saw it coming, there were no   
surprises,” she says. “Having insight into our global audience, we also   
have insight into the darker sides of how people can manipulate reviews   
and have other points of view that we wouldn’t support.”

Yep, sounds like the internet."
Conspiracy of Silence,"The pre-release marketing was all about how diverse the show was and how much they spent. After release, the trades (more marketing) released article after article about the racist fans and review bombing. I have definitely seen racist comments on Reddit and Twitter, but that never felt like the center of RoP problems.

I don't follow the insider stuff, but after all this bluster about diversity and racism, I am surprised that the show is run by two white guys with no show running experience. Given the money spent, Amazon could have easily picked up diverse, experienced show runners from Hollywood.

I thought the whole point of the diversity push was to tell stories from different perspectives."
Conspiracy of Silence,[deleted]
Conspiracy of Silence,It should have been marketed as a comedy. Because its a giant joke of a show.
Conspiracy of Silence,"""It was never about the critics, it’s all about consumers,” the insider says. “All Jeff cares about is consumer obsession. If you look at the history of Amazon, every division lived and died based on that … Dragon matters because all of a sudden there is a benchmark. It is their closest comp to success. When they saw Dragon grew in its second episode and brought in 20 million viewers, they were shitting their pants.”

This will be what everyone talks about when these seasons conclude. They end on the same week, with RoP only being 8 episodes."
Screw-Up Adults Sharehouse,"I mean yes. Most of the shows you listed are pretty average to bad and I don’t see any of the excellent TV listed from this past year:

Succession

The White Lotus

Black Bird

The Old Man

Slow Horses

Severance 

Bad Sisters

Five Days at Memorial

The Offer

Try those out, you won’t be disappointed."
Screw-Up Adults Sharehouse,I'm rewatching The Deuce in the absence of anything good that's new.
Screw-Up Adults Sharehouse,"This is or... *was* suppose to be the update for my [winter-spring compilation post](https://www.reddit.com/r/television/comments/voazid/the_best_and_worst_tv_shows_of_2022_so_far_winter/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3).   
  
I think I'm gonna go back to making single posts for each review, because I've realized writing a review right after I watch a show might've given me motivation to watch a lot of these shows in the first place.  
  
Anyways, recommendations are welcome as to what 2022 show I should watch and review next, cuz I don't even know what the fuck is happening anymore (*don't be obvious tho lol*)."
Screw-Up Adults Sharehouse,I've already lost it years ago. [In the late 00s](https://i.imgur.com/yv9nc8Q.png) used to watch close to 30 series a week [now I barely watch 2-3.](https://i.imgur.com/rb3Ab80.png)
Screw-Up Adults Sharehouse,"Recently watched Slow Horses and Severance, both slapped."
Screw-Up Adults Sharehouse,goddamn. how's the new season of Archer tho?
Screw-Up Adults Sharehouse,Still decent. Not as good as the early seasons though.
Screw-Up Adults Sharehouse,"American Dad is on TBS

I think we'll get the same nominees as last year (The Simpsons, Bob's Burgers, South Park, and Big Mouth) with What If... or Rick and Morty filling in for Primal."
Screw-Up Adults Sharehouse,"Animation in the US award shows is sadly always the most overlooked content. So many still find its only for ""kids"" and cant be serious drama for adults. (Filthy comedy yes)


I imagine What if and Arcane will be the non basic comedy amimated series to get nominated. 


Love death and robots should win the short section"
Screw-Up Adults Sharehouse,it is a crime that bojack horseman never won this.
Screw-Up Adults Sharehouse,where tf is invincible?
Screw-Up Adults Sharehouse,Huh. I'm surprised Nightmare of the Wolf is eligible; it stands out among everything here as being the only movie. And FXX was able to submit Poorly Drawn Lines and Swan Boy as single entries even though Poorly Drawn Lines was effectively a whole season of episodes and Swan Boy was a series of shorts?
Screw-Up Adults Sharehouse,Arcane nominated for animation and Jibaro for the short form? Thats all I could ask for
Screw-Up Adults Sharehouse,"I don't see What if...? nominated, mainly because it would be too much of a Disney domain, Arcane will probably be nominated due to his sweep of the Annie Awards and the aggressive campaign that Netflix and Riot have done, the rest I agree"
Screw-Up Adults Sharehouse,"

After primal won the emmy last year, it gave me some hope that the awards can improve, although they still have a way to go. That's why I strongly see an Arcane nomination.

Love death and robots is clearly the favorite to win the emmy in short section, the only one that can compete with it is Star Wars Vision, but having Alberto Mielgo, who just won the oscar for best animated short, gives it a plus."
Screw-Up Adults Sharehouse,"> I imagine What if and Arcane will be the non basic comedy amimated series to get nominated. 

You forgot Undone. It is a critically acclaimed animation from Amazon. Season 2 was released in April."
Screw-Up Adults Sharehouse,Bigger Snub in 2021
Screw-Up Adults Sharehouse,"Ooh you’re right, I feel like they usually slip in one non-animated sitcom style show (I know we could argue the degree to which some of these shows are sitcoms but in the ballpark) so you’re right Arcane is a safe bet. Did Rick and Morty have an eligible season for the 2021 Emmy’s I don’t see them winning twice on 2 nominations and then getting left off (unless that happened in 2021, I don’t follow the show that quickly) so one of the other shows might get edged out"
Screw-Up Adults Sharehouse,"It sounds like in some places you just missed the point entirely. 

Jet was a character designed to morally challenge the main characters. His motivations, hatred of the Fire Nation, were correct, but he went so far out of his way that regular people were being put in harm’s way. It makes our main characters re-evaluate their conflict and their own actions.

Aang’s blue tattoo isn’t because he’s an Avatar, it’s because he’s an air nomad, and most people really don’t care to notice him. Whenever they go into enemy territory, where people *would* recognize him, especially towards the end when he goes to the Fire Nation, he wears a disguise or hides himself.

Zuko and Azula’s character arcs are really well done by the end. Azula went completely crazy as a result of wanting to be desired and praised by her father (which was never going to happen), and Zuko learned to move beyond hatred and anger and found forgiveness in his heart. He finally moved past his own self-hatred like Iroh pleaded with him to. Their final Agni Kai isn’t just a big explosive action scene, it’s representative of an internal battle for Zuko, as he’s fighting against someone that is as ruthless and angry as he used to be. Katara saving the day & helping Zuko is also representative of her finally forgiving him instead of resenting him for what he had done. They finally became true friends in that moment. 

Both Zuko and Aang’s stories are mature. Aang’s people are dead, he’s a child, oh and by the way he’s been told his whole life how he has to save the world or else it’ll die. He acts childish as a coping mechanism for the unbelievable stress of being “the chosen one” at age **10**.

Sokka’s plans are oftentimes stupid and don’t work at the start, hence why nobody listens to him. His entire character arc is learning to be a good soldier, but an even better leader. By the end of the show, his plans work and are even the key to saving the day a number of times. He *is* the comic relief character, but it’s because he has to learn to grow up and stop “playing” soldier. By the end he is a mix of funny and serious in a way that he wasn’t before.

The magic system IMHO is liked because there is no “best power”. Every power is balanced, powerful, and yet weak when confronted with other factors, and even the most powerful abilities like lightning-bending are extremely dangerous and could kill the user. It’s also a visually exciting system as it combines magic & martial arts, leading to visually stunning moments.

Finally, the finale of the show is literally the culmination of everything it’s set up. Aang has finally mastered the elements, and Ozai is in his most powerful state thanks to Sozin’s comet, which is always how the show was going to end from day one. The “life-bending” from the Lion-Turtle isn’t a deus ex machina, it’s a skill the character learned in an earlier episode that was not shown to the audience to make for a great reveal. If Aang had life-bended without the island episode & Lion-Turtle setup, then it would’ve been a deus ex machina. Furthermore, his taking away of Ozai’s bending is hugely impactful, because he finally found a way to stop him without killing him, as everyone told him he was supposed to do. Life-bending itself isn’t without consequence either, TLA & Korra both show that it is a grave and irreversible punishment, but it shows that Aang has grown to be mature enough to accept that he has to do what needs to be done, but does not need to go overboard. 

You don’t have to like it, everyone is entitled to an opinion, but to post this haughty word salad of a post on here and then to tack on the “I can name ten animated shows far superior” at the end just makes it seem like you’re farming for outrage. Like it or don’t, but don’t come on to Reddit and act like you’re some trailblazer for having an opinion."
Screw-Up Adults Sharehouse,It's pretty good for being a kids cartoon
Screw-Up Adults Sharehouse,"I used to think it was overrated too.

Then I watched it."
Screw-Up Adults Sharehouse,Its actually one of the best written cartoons of all times with an extremely well thought out story arc that incorporated a rich backstory with characters with clear motivations that is very hard to duplicate. Almost every character and location is a full fleshed out idea and could be its own show.
Screw-Up Adults Sharehouse,"I’ve seen it mentioned that Combustion Man didn’t stop because by that point it was personal. Having lost a group of kids twice already he wanted to take them out. 

An Earth bender could have taken out the Fire Nation capital, but perhaps they want minimal collateral. Fire Nation works just take everyone out, but that doesn’t mean other nations would. 

Admiral Zhao vs the fish. They were the moon and the ocean spirit. They’d taken on a physical form on Earth so by killing the moon spirit, Zhao effectively broke the moon and water bending. 

Wood is not a bendable item. That was the whole issue with that jail cell

Azula had hinted in The Island (or whatever the episode was called) that there were skeletons in her closet where she says my own mother thought I was a monster. Then there’s the whole party scene that happened where she opens up to Ty Lee. After The Day of Black Sun she comes after Zuko. You can argue there that she has begun to slip. Then there’s The Boiling Rock where she loses Mai and Ty Lee and then Sozin’s Comet where the one person she had also leaves her. That all leads into her paranoia and her collapse

Jet was being blinded by his hatred for the Fire Nation, going after the innocent. His crew were trying to tell him that sometimes you should let things go. Katara and Aang were too naive that she trusted him when she shouldn’t have

The Great Divide wasn’t that good. However, spiders in real life can climb vertical objects. Avatar doesn’t have real life animals in it (other than the Earth King’s bear , Bosco) so who knows what they can do. Also, you’re complaining about realistic physics in a show where bending and spirits exist

As for Ozai, didn’t they have a whole scene where they realised the guy is just a normal looking dude from his baby photo. That was probably to show that anyone can end up a bad guy. The episode where there was that dance party was more of the same really. Showed that not everyone in the Fire Nation is bad.

Downvote guy and the turtle was pulled out of nowhere

Katara did ruin the Agni Kai but I’ve heard it said that by attacking Katara, that’s where Azula lost. She broke the rules

Which of Zuko and Aang’s story is childish? One deals with genocide and the other abuse. Nothing childish here"
Screw-Up Adults Sharehouse,"You raise some good points. For example, the deus ex machina ending is definitely a popular criticism of the show. It helps that Korra does a good job using it, and it fits into the themes of Atla. But it's definitely a valid criticism.

What isn't though is the vast amounts of minor nitpicks you have about the show. It's not that it's exactly bad to have them, but they take up too much of your argument, they are really minor details that every show has, and especially a lot of them can easily be explained in the show itself. 

The wooden cage criticism is especially bizarre. The fire benders know it's prisoners are earth benders. It makes complete sense to lock them in there for the time being. That season has also shown many times that other nation bender's live in the fire nation. So I'm not sure why you're confused they have wooden cages. 

Boom man is another example. I'm not sure how more obvious the show can make it that he has a personal vendetta again the gang. 

For future reference I would stay away from nitpicking. It's really hard to do correctly and just weakings your overall argument.

Also you should definitely try checking out Korra it's in my opinion a way better show. While the overall show is not as consistent as Avatar. It does a lot of more interesting things in its characters and plot than Avatar ever attempted."
Screw-Up Adults Sharehouse,Hello 30 yo guy who just found out Avatar.
Screw-Up Adults Sharehouse,"Eh, I'm a fan of Avatar and I think it's overrated. In terms of children's cartoons (90% of which are trash & have no thought put into them), it's the GOAT, but I don't think it's the best show ever made. I don’t even think it's a masterpiece."
Screw-Up Adults Sharehouse,">  I can name 10 right away that are far superior.

Yes, do that, at least this post will give me a watch list then."
Screw-Up Adults Sharehouse,"I agree with you in regards to comedy, it falls in to those constant anime tropes. That was my only criticism."
Screw-Up Adults Sharehouse,[deleted]
Screw-Up Adults Sharehouse,"I enjoyed it. It was definitely a kid's show as you never truly felt that the main characters were in peril.

You're right about Azula's turn to crazy being a 1 episode thing - it came on fast like in Game of Thrones when Dany turned evil for reasons to wrap up the show.

I still enjoyed it for what it is."
Screw-Up Adults Sharehouse,"Most of this is so wrong lol. But I’m only going to address the Azula part. She was starting to lose it even before the finale. Once Mai and TyLee betrayed her she became increasingly paranoid and stressed. So much to the point her bending style changed. Notice as early as the southern raiders she started using closed fists when firebending. She never did that anytime else prior, it was always two fingers. Also, her facial expressions and the things she was saying were definitely out of character. It progressively got worse until she started hallucinating and then having a full breakdown after losing in the finale.

You’ve seemed to have missed A LOT of detail in this show overall and made some very bold statements that indicated you didn’t really pay attention or understand a lot of the episodes or characters.For example somehow you think Sokka was supposed to be the equivalent of a comedian. No, Sokka was cringey as hell and downright awkward. He wasn’t mean to be actually funny lol. Or even questioning why combustion man didn’t stop when Zuko ordered him too…. like dude Team Avatar had already injured him by that point and it was personal. Besides, the fire lord would’ve rewarded him far more than Zuko ever could have. 

Therefore, I don’t think your judgment can be accurate. Also… Appa didn’t fly super fast across the avatar universe. It took them weeks on end just to get from the northern air temple to the northern water tribe. But your opinion is your opinion I guess. And.. that’s all I’m going to touch out of your essay lol."
Screw-Up Adults Sharehouse,"I think they HAD to be able to look at the eclipse, so that they could know when it was about to end and be prepared for the fire nation soldiers getting their powers back.

It's about knowing how much time you've gt in such a critical mission."
Screw-Up Adults Sharehouse,"I guess you are right about Jet but he should've been in series longer or atleast his death should've had more impact.

And I can see your Katara not listening to Sokka, but he has had great plans too.

Katara had already forgiven him, there was an entire episode dedicated towards that, that doesn't justify the moment she stole from Zuko and my problem isn't that Azula became crazy but she did it in like one episode, having authority can possibly make her crazy but not so fast.

I know Aang's childish he's 10. I'm just saying the feel and tone of his story doesn't flow well with Zuko's many times.

Yeah still not a fan of bending, Earth Bending just felt way too OP for me.

Spirit bending is dues ex machina, It literally fits perfectly in the definition of a dues ex machina, Aang has a conflict what do we do? Conveniently gets a power that allows him to win without killing Ozai, not only has Aang already killed before this conflict just came out of nowhere. Aang didn't went out to learn it or anything, he just was swept away and he got it from the turtle, he just got it. Keeping it a surprise doesn't make the moment better. Just because we saw scene with Aang & lion turtle doesn't mean it's not a Deus ex machina anymore.

Here's a video that might explain it better 
https://youtu.be/jdBnR_Dx4ow

And farming for outrage really? Anyone with different opinions than you is farming for outrage now? I literally gave the positives of the show at first and never called it a horrible show, even if I had I can have my opinion that a show is garbage or a masterpiece, and I literally gave reasons on why I think it's overrated unlike what people at r/unpopularopinions do"
Screw-Up Adults Sharehouse,"Yeah I agree, but it's not one of the best shows ever, it isn't even one of the best animated shows imo"
Screw-Up Adults Sharehouse,I used to think it was great. Then i watched it and didn't like it.
Screw-Up Adults Sharehouse,Opposite for me
Screw-Up Adults Sharehouse,"I watched twice(One alone, one with my girlfriend), yeah is one of the best cartoons produced ever in America, but that shows how bad the system is.  


Personally, I wouldn't say is a 9.2 in imdb, maybe a 8.5 at most, but even stuff like regular show is better than Avatar."
Screw-Up Adults Sharehouse,If this is one of the best written cartoon there must not be that many great cartoons then
Screw-Up Adults Sharehouse,"Combustion man was literally doing that for money and Zuko told him he'd pay more.

Jet was a good character that could've been fleshed out so much more, he just died and no one remembers him now.

Wood isn't bendable but you are in """"fire"""" nation, do you still don't get the problem?

IDC what Katara did that was Zuko's moment, not hers. Didn't Zuko just learned a pure form of fire bending? So that shouldve been used.

Zuko's story is mature while Aang's story is childish, they are just having fun meeting fun characters and occasionally running in problems.

The turtle thing and his conflict just came out of nowhere."
Screw-Up Adults Sharehouse,"That's the thing some shows or stories try bigger and more ambitious things and fail in parts but does many things right, I'd take that way more than a show perfectly going from a to b predictably

And how more accurate can show than boom man is against the gang? Let him say Zuko screw your money, I'm gonna kill them that's it.

Yeah some of the points really are small but I did also say about big things like disappointing characters"

Screw-Up Adults Sharehouse,"> The magic system annoyed me as they turned into wizards and not martial artists.  
  
The show convincingly portrays bending as an extension of a bender's limbs rather than simple spellcasting. It even showcases different bending styles (compare Toph's bending to the average earthbending, or Azula's bending to Zuko's)."
Screw-Up Adults Sharehouse,"Harry Potter actually did start very weak but it got better and better, really kicked the high gears from Prisoner of Azkaban. It's one of the best ya series out there and has many great characters.

Chosen one trope can work but didn't in Avatar for me."
Screw-Up Adults Sharehouse,">Most of this is so wrong lol. But I’m only going to address the Azula part. She was starting to lose it even before the finale. Once Mai and TyLee betrayed her she became increasingly paranoid and stressed. So much to the point her bending style changed. Notice as early as the southern raiders she started using closed fists when firebending. She never did that anytime else prior, it was always two fingers. Also, her facial expressions and the things she was saying were definitely out of character. It progressively got worse until she started hallucinating and then having a full breakdown after losing in the final

I guess, I don't remember lol

>Sokka was supposed to be the equivalent of a comedian. No, Sokka was cringey as hell and downright awkward. He wasn’t mean to be actually funny lol

No, he was always meant to be a comedic relief it's so obvious & Yes Sokka was cringey too. I like him but his comedy is just not upto the mark.

>Also… Appa didn’t fly super fast across the avatar universe. It took them weeks on end just to get from the northern air temple to the northern water tribe

I meant to say, It 'feels' like Appa moves really fast and the scale the show never convinced me the scale of the world at all."
Screw-Up Adults Sharehouse,Makes sense tbh
Screw-Up Adults Sharehouse,Jets death is one of the best scenes in the show.
Screw-Up Adults Sharehouse,And  m night shyamalan is a stealing a living
Screw-Up Adults Sharehouse,I think there is a lot of great adult cartoons to compare Avatar to now but at the time it was like comparing avatar to the Simpsons clearly there is a jump in quality. We have a lot of shows like avatar now both live action and cartoon but for a time it was really something special
Screw-Up Adults Sharehouse,there aren't
Screw-Up Adults Sharehouse,"The wooden jail cell was made to hold earth benders in. Similar to the metal ship prison and water bender prison, the fire nation was prepared to deprive other benders. Air benders couldn't be cut off so they killed everyone. 

Jet is the only character we encounter that died, I wouldn't say he is forgotten. He was a major representation for the increasing danger they faced. 

Zukos ""pure form"" of firebending is redirecting lighting, which he uses to save Katara when Azula attacks her. Because he almost doesn't make it, he still takes a major electric blow and if Katara didn't step in azula would have killed him. 

And as for Aangs story being childish, his 12. Him having to grow up too fast and being reluctant is a main plot point."
Screw-Up Adults Sharehouse,"They wouldn’t use a wooden cell for a fire bending prisoner. They’d use something like the cooler at The Boiling Rock. 

Katara wasn’t smart in that Agni Kai, that is true. 

Perhaps downvote guy is in denial? Actually he was unaware until he found out a few episodes in. He got mad about it and the whole Avatar State happened. Then later it’s shown the Avatar State scares him so maybe he didn’t want to go to that place emotionally again? Also, different personalities between Zuko and Downvote Guy. One desperately wants approval from his father and what he feels is rightfully his, believing his nation is the best due to propaganda (…what a great lie that was. They hate us - Zuko, Day of Black Sun). 

The other, very much a kid and didn’t want that to change (Why didn’t you tell us you were the Avatar? Because I never wanted to be). See how the other monks’ treated him when it was revealed he was the Avatar? How decisions were being made for him by the adults. He didn’t want that responsibility so he wanted to hang on to the good times. 

I don’t think Aang takes a human life at any point in the show."
Screw-Up Adults Sharehouse,">And how more accurate can show than boom man is against the gang? Let him say Zuko screw your money, I'm gonna kill them that's it.

I mean the show does do that. It has Zuko run up to him saying[""the mission is off"", ""I won't pay you if you continue"", and ""I'll pay double for you to stop.""](https://youtu.be/TbiqQecHzKo?t=201) As I said, I'm not sure how much more obvious they could make it.  

>Yeah some of the points really are small but I did also say about big things like disappointing characters

Sure, and those are valid points. But it makes it hard for others to get to those points after you bogged everything down with nitpicks.

>That's the thing some shows or stories try bigger and more ambitious things and fail in parts, I'd take that way more than a show perfectly going from a to b predictably.

Yeah, I definitely think you will appreciate Korra. It's very in line with that idea. It doesn't always succeed but when it does those moments are way better than anything found in Avatar."
Screw-Up Adults Sharehouse,"They all hate you because dissenting opinions are frowned on here. Even when as thoroughly explained as yours. Personally, I never got the hype either. I got a few episodes in before realizing that it was only a show intended for small children, and I wasn't the target demographic. Based on the Reddit hype, I had wrongly assumed it was more an all ages show. Not that all ages couldn't enjoy it, but it's specifically geared towards children."
Screw-Up Adults Sharehouse,90% of these shows came out after avatar or weren't airing in the US at the time. This is like saying Romeo and Juliet is not as good as twilight.
Screw-Up Adults Sharehouse,Just running across this thread. Clone Wars is not even the best Star Wars cartoon. It doesn’t even come close to top 10 cartoons of all time.
Screw-Up Adults Sharehouse,I think you just really like sci fi.
Screw-Up Adults Sharehouse,[deleted]
Screw-Up Adults Sharehouse,Which meant nothing for the show
Screw-Up Adults Sharehouse,I've heard season 4 didn't happen because of his movie lmao
Screw-Up Adults Sharehouse,"Well in my opinion: the tom and jerry show, courage the cowardly dog, dexters laboratory, Craig of the creek, then ren & stimpy show, invader zim, ninjago, the amazing world of gumball, any looney tunes show, adventure time, the regular show, apple and onion, spongebob squarepants. So basically what im trying to say is: there are"
Screw-Up Adults Sharehouse,Standard is pretty low then
Screw-Up Adults Sharehouse,"Yeah so you are making a jail in fire bending nation only for water benders? Who aren't even gonna be there?

Yeah idk wasn't a fan of Jet.

I'm not saying Aang is childish I mean he is, but his story and Zuko's story felt very different like two different shows. 

Zuko's pure form isn't lightning he didn't go there to learn lightning redirecting, he wasn't able to produce fire efficiently, he didn't see colorful lighting there he saw fire"
Screw-Up Adults Sharehouse,"You dont think Aang took any human life??
Well https://youtu.be/PYmLKzgLbUo"
Screw-Up Adults Sharehouse,"Idk atla fans hate that series too much. Maybe someday I'll watch it.

And yeah maybe you are right about the boom man, He was an actual threat lol like Azula which Aang never defeated, so unbelievable that Ozai isn't even in top 3 best villians of the series."
Screw-Up Adults Sharehouse,People are downvoting because they are not thinking of the show in the context it was created. I can't think of many things before this time on American TV and especially for children come close to avatar.
Screw-Up Adults Sharehouse,"“A few episodes in.” So…. the episodes before it even touches on grieve, misogyny, war, dishonor, genocide, or any of the characters developed / any world building happened…. wtf? It’s literally only childish for the first 8 episodes. There’s a reason it has a huge fanbase with a wildly varying demographic."
Screw-Up Adults Sharehouse,Wtf is this argument? I think these shows are better who cares if they came out in seperate years & 3 of these came before avatar so 30%
Screw-Up Adults Sharehouse,"If your argument is a comparison, its probably a bad argument."
Screw-Up Adults Sharehouse,I like fantasy much more
Screw-Up Adults Sharehouse,"I mean it's ya and I'm 18 so yeah maybe, but I think HP got more mature as it went on that's why people like it so much, you stopped at book 3 but that's when the series gets even better maybe it's not for you."
Screw-Up Adults Sharehouse,what do you mean? It meant a lot in the show. I think you might have been doing something else while watching this show.
Screw-Up Adults Sharehouse,"Season 4 didn't happen because the story was over.

It was always planned as a 3 season arc"
Screw-Up Adults Sharehouse,Did you comment to a thread that is over a month old? Also did you ignore all the points I made and listed shows that share none of the ground breaking things I stated?
Screw-Up Adults Sharehouse,.....dude idk why your writing like an ass again but you wrote like 2 pages of the show. You have a little bit of a strange hard on for this show.
Screw-Up Adults Sharehouse,"Yes. Fire nation specifically created the water bending jail and rounded up all of the south pole bender and brought them to the fire nation. The do similar things to earth kingdom benders. The wood was to stop earth benders. Iirc they knew that team avatar was in the fire nation at that point but I imagine it was meant for general earth nation benders that may attack the main land. 

If you're talking about when Zuko meets the dragons, he didn't learn a new form of firebending, he learned a new source within himself to replace his original, rage and anger. He was never going to produce flames like the dragons. He uses what he learned from them the remainder of the series. Im talking about when Iroh teaches him how to handle Azulas lightning."
Screw-Up Adults Sharehouse,Forgot about that. You got me there. Unless that’s the Ocean Spirit doing stuff
Screw-Up Adults Sharehouse,">Idk atla fans hate that series too much. Maybe someday I'll watch it.

They also think an overrated show is the best thing ever. What do they know, in all seriousness though, it's up to you if you wanna watch it. I'm just recommending it.

>Ozai isn't even in top 3 best villians of the series.

Yeah, Ozai's my biggest issue with the original series. He is a pretty boring villain and Mark Hammil hams him up too much, ruining any fear factor he could've had.

That's another thing Korra thankfully fixes."
Screw-Up Adults Sharehouse,Context doesn't make a show more enjoyable though. Just because a TV show was good for the time doesn't make it any good now.
Screw-Up Adults Sharehouse,I can
Screw-Up Adults Sharehouse,hahah someone is a little grumpy. You know you don't need to like everything everyone else likes?
Screw-Up Adults Sharehouse,It also matters a lot when things come out. actually.
Screw-Up Adults Sharehouse,.....What? Hahaha
Screw-Up Adults Sharehouse,What did it meant? At the end?

Screw-Up Adults Sharehouse,"I just gave my reasons because saying __ sucks without giving reasons would sound dumb why, I just thought it wasn't that great as much as it's praised, on IMDb which I know isn't objective fact but there it's higher than The Sopranos, and also this took like 20 minutes to write."
Screw-Up Adults Sharehouse,"Yeah but after that dragon thing. It made more sense for Zuko to defeat Azula alone.

I just think capturing Katara and toph in fire bending clothes in a wooden chamber is stupid."
Screw-Up Adults Sharehouse,And the avalanche?
Screw-Up Adults Sharehouse,I very very strongly disagree with you. Context matters a great deal.
Screw-Up Adults Sharehouse,Hahaha you know opinions exist? And I like many popular things
Screw-Up Adults Sharehouse,Still I believe few years doesn't matter that much
Screw-Up Adults Sharehouse,Ok so reading those tweets it seems like they had thrown the idea around for a fourth season but never properly confirmed it as the original plan was 3 seasons and the Shyamalan movie just kind of cemented the idea that it should be 3 seasons like it was from the start.
Screw-Up Adults Sharehouse,hahah....hahaha I hope that comment gave your life meaning.
Screw-Up Adults Sharehouse,It's Fire *Nation* clothes. Not everyone in the Fire Nation is a Fire Bender.
Screw-Up Adults Sharehouse,Guess he has then. I've seen this memed before to be fair
Screw-Up Adults Sharehouse,"It can but not all context will. If its a chinese historical drama maybe knowing a lot about chinese history will make it more interesting. But telling people, it's a kids show so suck it up, even if true will not in anyway positively affect their viewing experience."
Screw-Up Adults Sharehouse,yeah. Not sure why you are responding like a child.
Saki,Very humbling answer. Glad to see the cast is still close.
Saki,RIP Uncle Phil 
Saki,Why the hell is Fresh Prince not on Netflix or Hulu!
Saki,How about True Detective season 4 with Will and Carlton as LAPD Homicide detectives.  
Saki,"Yup, Uncle Phil was the voice of reason when Will got too deep into some crazy scheme or Carlton was too naive to realize what'a happening."
Saki,"don't act like they're not all gonna show up on the Tonight Show. Jimmy Fallon is gonna insert himself as Corn Flake, there will be a joke about whichever Vivian isn't there, then a tribute to James Avery, and close out with everyone doing Carlton Dance and/or Apache. all the while Will Smith vlogs the experience. "
Saki,Honestly I think they could have done it justice putting Carlton in the role of the wise but stern Uncle to a new fresher prince. But I absolutely respect what Alfonso is saying here. 
Saki,[deleted]
Saki,"Thank you, Mr. Ribiero!"
Saki,thank god at least one television star from the 90's has an iota of good taste & restraint
Saki,[deleted]
Saki,"Bah.

Will's a lawyer now, maybe an ADA or something, some young relative of his wife's is in a hard spot, he takes them into his mansion, antics ensue, Uncle Carlton dances, ""aww"" track plays over the group hug, everyone gets paid. 

It's doable."
Saki,and because he knows Jaden Smith would be the new lead.
Saki,"We need a reverse Fresh Prince.

Rich Will Smith thinks his son is getting to spoiled and sends him to live with his grandma in West Philly to learn street smarts."
Saki,HOLY SHIT! I never knew James Avery was born in Suffolk! That's where I was raised! :o
Saki,"That’s a good answer but if Will Smith wanted to do this, filming would start in less than a week"
Saki,Maybe original Aunt Viv can play Uncle Phil.
Saki,"I am glad there's no revival.

We've had so many goddamn revival shows, and most, if not all, of them have sucked ass. They either don't capture the essence of the original characters, or they try too hard to hit that nostalgia factor that it's not working.

A Fresh Prince revival would honestly just ruin the entire show it's built on. And Ribeiro is right in that Uncle Phil really was the most important character, and any replacement would create a different tone entirely (Look at Aunt Vivian)."
Saki,"Uncle Phil was the strong, magnanimous, caring, endearing figure that kept that family together.  And he was a fucking pool shark.  "
Saki,"It would be like The Simpsons without Dan C. James Avery made that role an icon.  

In mid-1990s Sweden, there were very few black people around. But we would watch shows like Fresh Prince and Family Matters, and those guys kind of became ambassadors for people we weren't used to seeing. People used to point at them and whisper until maybe the late 80s, but it wasn't a big deal for the young generation after that."
Saki,No more reboots this man is a hero.  
Saki,"I mean, it's like Dallas. There was no point after JR died in real life."
Saki,That's actually very true. He was so crucial to the entire show's emotional and comedic aspects 
Saki,First thing first rest in peace uncle Phil 
Saki,"Here’s the plot. Uncle Phil died in a tragic skydiving accident a lá Trevor. Hillary is famous and went through a very public nervous breakdown. The rest of the family lost all of its money during the recession of ‘08. They have moved back to Philadelphia. The thugs that Will ran from catch up to him. Turns out the reason he left for Bel-Air was that he went to the police when they messed with him back in the early 90s. He put their boy Essential Root in jail and they never forgot so they beat him to the point of brain damage. His personality is permanently stuck in 1993. Cool thing is, one of them was an heir to the Philadelphia Cream Cheese fortune. Will is rich again. He and Carlton (obviously an ardent Trump supporter) live together in an apartment in Philly. It’s a very Bert and Ernie by way of Withnail and I type of situation. Will hangs out with some white teenagers that are “hedonists indulging in the meme lifestyle, devoting their lives to performance art in the name of pure, unfettered aesthetic, and their chosen aesthetic is early 90s hip hop culture.” Their words. They worship Will due to his condition, lie around the apartment all day getting high, making messes and eating all the food. Carlton hates them. Oh, and he is a raging alcoholic.

It all seems like a very gritty, tonally strange reboot along the lines of The Wire mixed with House Party 1 and 2 until one sunny day Will and Carlton are at the farmer’s market. Normally doting over Will and keeping him on a short leash, he’s distracted by a happy memory from a better time: Tom Jones is playing. He loses track of Will, who runs into a very rude and conniving blonde lady that recognizes him from the news and knows about his Philadelphia Cream Cheese fortune.

CUT TO BLACK SCREEN WITH TEXT:

Sweet Dee’s Dating a Retarded Person 2: The Not-so-Fresh Prince"
Saki,Good call
Saki,Alfonso gets it.
Saki,All of them were irreplaceable. They can try but they won't capture the magic again 
Saki,I don't want a revival of the show. A lot of the humor in the show was Will Smith acting ridiculous. He's too serious of an actor to do that stuff anymore
Saki,"That's respectable.

To be real the only way I'd like to see a new ep is if it was one where they all got together and they're all older with their own families and the whole ep revolves around remembering the old times, and more specifically uncle Phil. 

Kinda like a send off of finality. Will got to be the father he never had, Carlton got into something prestigious and became like a broker or maybe a judge like his dad. Hillary found a sugar daddy."
Saki,James Avery died? :(
Saki,"We didn't need it, it was fine when it aired. Not everything has to be an easy remake. Oh wait I forgot it's cheap"
Saki,"It's interesting to think of this answer in context with how Roseanne was handled.  If they can do that, why can't Fresh Prince circle back with the original characters while simultaneously and tastefully paying tribute to the legacy of Uncle Phil / James Avery?  "
Saki,How about creating new content? So easy to rehash shit...
Saki,Like Will Smith would take the paycut to do TV anyways
Saki,The patriarch who protected Will. A noble character who was strong for his entire family and then some.
Saki,I agree.  He was basically like the heavy in tf2.  The cornerstone.
Saki,First things first Rest In Peace Uncle Phil forreal 
Saki,I need me some more Hilary in my life. 
Saki,">Uncle Phil Was ‘Most Important’ Character

* You're goddamn right.
"
Saki,why the fuck would they even consider this?
Saki,He wasn’t the most important but the show would feel empty without him 
Saki,"Oh please. They'll find a way to make a remake. It's all about money.

There is no creativity today with television and movies. This is why we are constantly resold things from the past.

They'll make a newer version of the show called ""The freshest prince of Bel Aire."" with a whole different cast but people will still watch it because they have a weakness for nostalgia because it brings them back to a happier time."
Saki,"Here is how they revisit the show, makes fans happy, and still pay proper respect to James Avery:

The Fresh Prince of Bel Air: Goodbye Uncle Phil (a 60-90 minute reunion episode)

Show opens with Vivian, Hilary, and Ashley in the house. Hilary and Ashley are talking with their mom about how they can't believe she is going to sell the house. She says now that it's just her and Geoffrey she doesn't need as much room. They all three proceed to share fond, funny memories (using flashbacks to episodes from the series).

Geoffrey comes in and joins the conversations. More laughs. More flashbacks.

Carlton comes in. They joke and laugh. He dances for some reason. He joins the conversation. More memories.

Doorbell rings. It's Will, returning from Philadelphia where he runs the Philip Banks youth center. Jokes. Laughs. Memories.

Fade to the funeral service. Family greeting friends and extended family. They begin sharing more emotional memories around Uncle Phil's urn, building up to Will talking about how much Uncle Phil helped him, especially with his dad, and how he wouldn't be the man he is had it not been for him. 

The service begins. The pastor is brief. Will gives a moving Eulogy. 

As everyone leaves, Will suggests that they move to Philadelphia to be close to him and his mom, and that they could help him run the center. They concur. 

Show closes with everyone looking forward to more time together in Philly.

Theme song plays, but words are changed to reflect moving back to Pennsylvania. 

Credits roll.


(Clearly this would have to be well written, with lots of banter, so as not to be too dark.)"
Saki,Uncle Phil was a great character... but wouldn’t the Fresh Price be the most important character of his self titled show?
Saki,"First things first, rest in peace uncle Phil."
Saki,I miss my uncle charles yall
Saki,I'm glad they're not rebooting it - it's amazing as it is. 
Saki,I sincerely hope they stick by this. All remakes generally do is suck all the nostalgia out of programs that were once enjoyable. Fresh Prince was a good show. Let it be.
Saki,"I cant help but also think that Will Smith wouldn't want to risk besmirching the legacy of one of his greatest successes. People will stop remembering it for it was, and will instead judge it by their memory of the reboot. Why risk it?"
Saki,This could be true but the main reason is that Will Smith is now too big to do something like this. 
Saki,Doesn’t he know will is the new uncle Phil?
Saki,"Let's be real, do you know how much they'd have to pay Will Smith to do that show again?"
Saki,First things first test in peace uncle Phil 
Saki,Maybe they should do un Uncle Phil revival instead. 
Saki,Loyalty. Much respect to Carlton 
Saki,So was Roseanne
Saki,"They should do a spin off where he is the new ""Uncle Phil"" and takes in Hilary or Will's wayward kid."
Saki,I wonder they don't want to do a full reunion they definitely should because it was such an iconic tv show.
Saki,They could do a short eulogy episode about uncle Phil's death. Would be a sweet send off.
Saki,Hey G can you make me a sandwich
Saki,"I think the show could work being about James Avery's influence on two very different young men who are now his age. I mean, that's actually how life is in that we all end up adults and our role models have a profound effect on who we become.

Plus, you know, Jazzy."
Saki,"I couldn't watch a Fresh Prince revival without original Uncle Phil, doesn't feel the same."
Saki,First things first rest in peace uncle Phil. 
Saki,"I agree. Uncle Phil taught wisdom to a whole generation. I'm not talking about a basic ""lesson"" that gets lost in meaningless humour, like a lot of comedies now. I mean real hard life lessons, without easy answers, that you can really think about."
Saki,First things first RIP uncle Phil.
Saki,"I believe Fresh Prince would make a great animated sitcom. That way they can still use a similar cartoon likeness of Uncle Phil and I'm sure someone could do a good impression of him. It's true, Uncle Phil was the most important character."
Saki,I wouldn't say most.. but if they did make it.. would flow.. uncle phill RIP
Saki,I figured a reunion special where they all get back together for Uncle Phil's funeral and it shows where all of the characters ended up and the impact he had on them would be nice.
Saki,He’s not wrong. 
Saki,"On one hand He is right, Uncle Phil was the most important character, but on the other Hand that was the same thing said about Roseanne, so..."
Saki,Story could include uncle phil passing away. 
Saki,"*From the article: “Do we really want to see Will and Carlton in their, you know, 40s and 50s?”*

well, yes, I watch you every weekend on ""Americas  funniest"" and I watch Will in movies over the past decades

So yeah I think your covered on that end.."
Saki,Good. No one was wanting one anyway.
Saki,Has no one proposed having Roasanne play the role of Uncle Phil? 
Saki,"I honestly always thought Will would grow up to be very much like Uncle Phil, but I respect this decision."
Saki,"If they were to do an episode, I would hope it were just to immortalize James Avery. Can't see the show happening without him. "
Saki,Maybe we could get an Uncle Phil prequel series starring [Colton Dunn](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5372cbbae4b05ff1a0844a5f/t/57ad1ba8d2b8575c1ea85265/1470962615381/ColtonDunn).
Saki,"I revisit the show every once in a while, am a fan of all the crew.  Uncle Phil was a powerful character in there, aside from his comedic situations, he set the tone and moral for young Wil as he navigates his teenage and later, college years!"
Saki,Didn't know he still have the luxury of turning down jobs.  I feel like this is a TIL moment. 
Saki,It would be literally impossible to do anything without the original cast members.
Saki,The episode could be them all getting back together to reminisce 
Saki,You can't have a prince without a King
Saki,That USED to be my favorite show.
Saki,"Good.  Stop reviving old shows, move on."
Saki,Just get colton dunn to play him; he'd be great!
Saki,"What about a silver spoons revival?

Ricky is still alive and well
"
Saki,"I don’t know, Will Smith is as old as Uncle Phil, I think it’d be interesting to see Will at a crossroads. Starting at the funeral for Uncle Phil, Will having lost the most amazing father figure anyone could ever have, it would be interesting to see a hybrid Will/Phil trying to figure out parenthood with a family. "
Saki,I used to love when Uncle Phil got angry or was being gruff and his voice would flip into Shredder mode. 
Saki,"I was at a taping of the drew carey show and alfonso came on set.

Everyone chanted for him to do the Carlton.  He was ended up doing it but you could tell he just wished people would remember him for something else.

"
Saki,Damn straight ;(
Saki,"As sad as this makes me, he's right. James Avery was realistically the glue that held it all together. "
Saki,"Yeah that's definitely the reason it's not happening, and not the fact that Will Smith costs a kabrillion dollars.

Let's face it, they're making Roseanne without Roseanne now, there's no depths that TV won't sink to if there's a potential buck in it."
Saki,Will becomes the father figure.
Saki,"They need to do a new Fresh Prince, with Will as the ""Uncle Phil"" character. Anybody else see the resemblance in that bungee jumping photo a few months back?"
Saki,"First things first, Rest In Peace Uncle Phil..."
Saki,"He has a point about do people want to see Carlton and Will in their 40s & 50s? It would be a tribute to Avery, and his character, to say ""Yes"". What type of careers did these two actually pursue? What of their family lives? Are they passing on the lessons Uncle Phil taught them to their own children?

It wasn't my favorite show, but it was one my kids loved, and one I didn't have to worry about them watching. I don't worry about my grandkids watching it.

With the recent uptick in civil rights abuses over the last two decades, I think it would be a good time to do a reunion show. I'd suggest a holiday episode a few years after Uncle Phil had passed away. Carlton and Will start reminiscing over drinks in the kitchen. Could be alcoholic, but I tend to think it would play better with coffee or cocoa. Family members join them, one by one, discussing what they remember about Phil Banks and his wisdom. Unlike most sitcom dads of the time, his character was a throwback to when dad's were competent. 

Instead of turning it into a clip show, they can tell stories about their lives after college and how they came to a cross-roads and could hear Phil say whatever words of wisdom he fit their story. Not a flashback, but just a voice over."
Saki,"That’s nice of him to say, but the real reason is the fact that Will Smith became one of the biggest stars on the planet, so he obviously wouldn’t waste his time with a cheesy cash-grab reunion. 

While they are at it, someone should ask JC Chasez why there hasn’t been an NSYNC reunion. "
Saki,Good 
Saki,"Rest in peace, Uncle Phil"
Thermae Romae,"So glad I discovered this. It's so absurd but I, like Lucius, got well and truly sucked in to the world of thermae. I also love the English dub voice actor for Lucius, at first I found his character a little pompous but then the actor just leans so hard into the role and just adds so much mustard to every line delivery it made it hilarious to watch. 

On ep 3 and I can't wait to learn more about Japanese bath houses.

P.s. I am now obsessed with the onsen tamago and I want to try those eggs one day"
Thermae Romae,It’s crazy how many ideas the show explores with just a concept of a bath
Thermae Romae,"I fucking love this show, it's amazing.

And i believe the Japanese woman is author of the manga."
Thermae Romae,"I watched the first ep and didn’t like it that much for the reasons you say, but I’ll try ep 2 based on this. Thanks!"
Thermae Romae,"Literally the best anime I've ever watched on Netflix it has so much charm and great moments. It's so fun watching him get transported to different time periods in Japan and watching his reactions to all their bathing techniques, and culture as he incorporates them into his world and somehow impresses all of Rome too haha hilarious."
Thermae Romae, It's based on a manga series. There are actually two live action movies that were pretty popular in Japan.
Thermae Romae,"The time/space travel via water is a minor anime trope, however this is indeed a delightful use of it. Is very interesting to look at roman times from a radically different point of view to boot"
Thermae Romae,"Just finished it the other night and I loved it.  Like others said, skip ep1 it's a waste of time."
Thermae Romae,"Love the quirkiness and setting of this show. One of the most original things I've seen in anime. And I like how there's no real drama, it's a nice relaxing change of pace"
Thermae Romae,"Nope, but will def check it out."
Thermae Romae,"The concept is good. But the execution is too blend. Every episode is exactly the same: some elite wants him to design a bath, he and his friend takes a bath, he gets sucked into Japanese bathhouse, kind Japanese gives him treat (no one bothered to call cops or wondered about the time portal), he gets awed at how advanced modern Japan is, then he wakes up, uses inspiration to design Roma bath. Epilogue is a real life lady visiting and commenting on bath.

Every episode is structured the same. No conflict, no character growth, and no social commentary except Japan = advanced.

This is basically an expensive tourism project to promote Japanese hot-springs or bathhouse, funded by Netflix Japan.

TDLR: if you are looking for raunchy anime mixed bath moments, or an Isekai using Hot Tub Time Machine as a gimmick, you’ll be like me, sorely disappointed."
Thermae Romae,"dude constantly calling japanese people ""flat face""

kinda odd since ancient rome knows and traded with china"
Thermae Romae,"I haven't yet. I was a big fan of the original run of this show, so this remake looks to be more of the same but with an actual budget. Will have to check it out."
Thermae Romae,It’s my kind of weird. Really good show!
Thermae Romae,"The premise of the show is so absurd, but it's amazing"
Thermae Romae,"I'm a bit late to this thread, but the show is fabulous. I don't know if there'll be a second season, though I certainly hope so. With few minor exceptions, it's a very wholesome anime -- so long as you're okay with a lot of rear-facing male nudity, lol -- and downright comical. The lead character's over the top reactions and extreme pride of Roman bathhouses is beautiful."
Thermae Romae,"I'm way late to this thread but I finished the show like a month ago and loved it. It's not the badass old school anime that I am used to watching, but it's just simply fun to watch. I think it's blatant tourist propaganda much like what NHK puts out, but who cares? It's fun!"
Thermae Romae,">P.s. I am now obsessed with the onsen tamago and I want to try those eggs one day

All you need is an immersion circulator for sous vide, and you too can do onsen tamago (most folks will tell you 145ºF for 45 min, but I prefer 150ºF for 45 min, ymmv). You can also do it with a pot, an instant read thermometer and a kettle, but it's more of a PITA.

Thermae Romae,"100% utterly delightful. I will forevermore pronounce Rome the way the voice actor for Lucius does. Never ""Rome"" never a ""Roman"", always ""Rrrrrrrrrome"" and ""Rrrrromann!!!!"" 😄"
Thermae Romae,"Yes she is now I need to read the manga after finishing this series, it's so damn amazing!"
Thermae Romae,Yeah it's a massive improvement. Not sure why they didn't just start with episode 2. I feel like the back story is unnecessary and the tone is totally detached from what follows.
Thermae Romae,"Hey, the first episode is kind of an origin story. The real stuff kicks off from the second episode."
Thermae Romae,Really? Do you gots the titles for a homie?
Thermae Romae,"Nope, not looking for raunchy, thanks"
Thermae Romae,It’s not raunchy but it’s DEFINITELY suggestive. Lucius is naked for like half of every episode and half the bathing shots are loaded with innuendo. Super fan-servicey in a really cute lighthearted way.
Thermae Romae,"traded via third parties

Knowing something exists and being there is quite different"
Thermae Romae,"I know this is an old comment, but Lucius calling the Japanese ""flat-face"" is actually a reflection of Japanese views on how white people look. There the stereotype is that Westerners have ""long"" or ""big noses"".  So the Japanese imagine a Westerner who calls the Japanese ""flat-face"". The same way Westerners imagine them to call them ""round eyes""  because the stereotype of Asians is that htey have ""squinty eyes""."
Thermae Romae,Watch english dub only.
Thermae Romae,"Eggs come from a chicken that in most cases was abused. I admire the Japanese culture but not when an animal gets  exploited and treated cruelly. Also, no - taste is not a good reason to do this to animals."
Thermae Romae,Thermae Romae and Thermae Romae 2
Thermae Romae,Why? I didn't find a problem with the subs
Thermae Romae,Man shut up 🤣
Thermae Romae,The english voice actor is basically off his meds and gets crazy into it
Thermae Romae,You think animal abuse is acceptable?
Thermae Romae,Course not I have pets but you are an extremist. Just chill.
Thermae Romae,"We are talking about the descendants of dinosaurs, they should be abused lest they rise again."
Thermae Romae,Ahh so it's extreme to speak up against animal cruelty? Is it not more extreme to pay for animal cruelty?
Thermae Romae,HAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAH
Thermae Romae,Nah you're just an extremist.
Thermae Romae,If you're against animal abuse you're an extremist too by your logic. You're inconsistent.
Thermae Romae,Bruh
Thermae Romae,Being against animal abuse is different than telling people to not eat honey because bee's are abused. You just sound like a lunatic.
Thermae Romae,I'm talking about chickens. Why is it different? In both cases an animal is being abused. The only difference is how you justify it to yourself but that doesn't make it okay to abuse the animal.
Thermae Romae,"Honestly, Netflix has been hitting home-runs with these eccentric anime. Both Kotaro lives alone and Thermae were great!"
Thermae Romae,"> Thermae Romae is reborn on Netflix!

> Mari Yamazaki’s manga masterpiece “Thermae Romae,” which won the 2010 Manga Taisho (Cartoon Grand Prize) Award and the Short Story Prize at the 14th Tezuka Osamu Cultural Prize, has been animated as the Netflix Series “Thermae Romae Novae”! Mari Yamazaki herself has done the series composition for this project.
Why did Lucius want to become a bathhouse architect? Join him as he travels through time not only to modern-day Japan, but to the Edo period as well!
This new bath-time-travel comedy serves as a continuation of the story that couldn’t fit in the original manga.

> The Netflix Series “Thermae Romae Novae” streams worldwide from Monday, March 28, only on Netflix."
Thermae Romae,Looks like a terrible SNL skit.
Thermae Romae,No thanks
Thermae Romae,But I've seen it before
Thermae Romae,"great show, fun reverse isekai"
Thermae Romae,That is the weirdest show I have ever seen.
Thermae Romae,What else can be called reverse Isekai? Star Trek 4?
Thermae Romae,"How is it a ""reverse"" isekai?"
Thermae Romae,"They can get even weirder, one of my personal favorites is [Dorohedoro](https://youtu.be/iH_YJde1yps)"
Thermae Romae,The live action movie is even stranger since all the Romans are played by Japanese people.
Thermae Romae,Austin Powers
Thermae Romae,"Off the top of my head... the Devil is a part timer, kobayashis dragon maid, GATE, kuromukuro, re:creators, hinamatsuri."
Thermae Romae,"normal isekai is someone from the current earth going somewhere new, reverse is someone from another place going to present day earth"
Thermae Romae,"Dorohedoro is just awesome, though. Its weirdness is up front.   


This show, it's like it doesn't understand how weird it is, and just moves along at a pace and tone of a normal anime. Like, we should all completely ignore the homoerotic stuff and the fact that in a show about baths, everyone looks dirty all the time."
Thermae Romae,"Devil is a Part Timer is so fun, can’t wait for that Season 2!"
Thermae Romae,The Masters of the Universe live action movie?
Thermae Romae,I could not believe >!he was actually into women. I'm guessing they felt they didn't have time to explore the gay subplot.!<
Thermae Romae,i dont keep track of new shows enough to know if this is true but a small part of me hopes it is
Thermae Romae,It’s very real. It premieres in July.
Thermae Romae,"https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2021-12-12/the-devil-is-a-part-timer-season-2-video-unveils-more-cast-new-studio-july-debut/.180550

It’s true!"
Thermae Romae,"Gotta hand it to whomever came up with this idea for an anime, definitely something I never would have thought of."
Thermae Romae,what the fuck is this show even
Thermae Romae,This show was so uniquely bonkers. Loved it.
Thermae Romae,Is this worth watching? It popped up on my Netflix feed and caught my attention (how could it not?) but wasn't ready to start something new.
Thermae Romae,"*Verdi's 'Va, pensiero' starts playing.*"
Thermae Romae,There's also a pretty decent live action adaptation.
Thermae Romae,"> Thermae Romae (Japanese: テルマエ・ロマエ, Hepburn: Terumae Romae) is a Japanese manga series by Mari Yamazaki.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mari_Yamazaki

Thermae Romae,"Terrible, it's terrible. But it's about bathhouses"
Thermae Romae,"It's a comedy about a time traveling Roman water/bathhouse architect. In every episode he encounters a problem in ancient Rome having to do with bathroom type stuff, he gets whisked away to modern Japan, and he receives inspiration that solves his original problem. Comedy ensues along the way. It's a fun watch but your entertainment value may differ based on how much you enjoy fish out of water type scenarios."
Thermae Romae,"I think I might have watched a previous adaptation. It was funny and a bit clever, not necessarily great but decent if you like the humor. Netflix has a decent selection of good anime depending on your preference"
Thermae Romae,"I thought it was a great watch. Funny, educational, and ultimately pretty wholesome. I don’t think it’ll be winning any awards but I enjoyed it a ton and I’m really hoping there’s another season."
Thermae Romae,"Hasn't it got a Japanese guy playing Lucius?

Looks very low budget. Don't see it holding a candle to this terrific Netflix series."
Thermae Romae,It’s not terrible!
Outbreak,that seems like a pretty standard dystopian story move. it's an easy way to fill episodes out and explore the characters before everything went to hell. it's also cheap to shoot in standard before-world so you don't have to use the budget creating and decorating another set with dirt and firefly posters
Outbreak,We about to get the tutorial as a TV series
Outbreak,I liked how Lost gave back stories to characters. Each episode would cut away a few times showing the survivor's life before the crash.
Outbreak,"If I had to guess, the first episode is 30-45 mins of regular life and maybe ends with **that** moment."
Outbreak,First episode is going to be Joel filing his taxes. Episode 2 is him mailing stuff at the post office.
Outbreak,Makes sense for an adaptation. Gives it a little more weight and easily leads into the games intro.
Outbreak,"How well it will go, totally depends on how much time they're actually spending on ""life before"". I'd imagine most show watchers have been burned out about stupid filler material and spending too much time on ""before the outbreak"" would be just that. People aren't watching the show to see the normal lives."
Outbreak,"In these kinds of movies I love the part just before the outbreak starts. Where the main characters hear rumours of what's happening, but shit has not hit the fan yet. You start feeling tense as you wait for it. And then BOOM! The outbreak happens and there's chaos. You see how bewildered and uncomprehending they are about what's going on as they try to grapple with the unbelievable situation."
Outbreak,Isn’t life before the outbreak just a crappy family drama?
Outbreak,I recently started Party Down and now that I picture everyone who bitches about sci-fi or fantasy on the internet as Roman from that show it all makes more sense.
Outbreak,"So… like normal life?

Why the hell do we want to see that?"
Outbreak,"""HBOs new show will finally set up the story"""
Outbreak,I have always wanted to see Joel file his taxes
Outbreak,Life before the outbreak is our normal ass timeline up until October 2013. Sounds like mundane filler.
Outbreak,That would be funny if it turns out to be a rom-com set in the year before the zombie apocalypse.
Outbreak,"I just don't want to see another Station Eleven situation where the interesting post apocalypse setting gets sidelined to drag the audience through meaningless identity melodrama at upper class dinner parties from the Before Time. I know it's a cheap and easy way to pad the runtime, but you kill your pacing when you wallow around in flashbacks that don't matter and a setting that isn't relevant anymore. Civilization is gone and 90% of people are dead, nobody cares that your rich parents were mean to your lesbian girlfriend at Christmas before they died and money became irrelevant. 

I would hope that flashback use will be brief and relevant."
Outbreak,First game can be done in 8 eps. 2nd game can be done in 2 seasons if they want to streech. How many seasons did they say they would make ??
Outbreak,"Watch out reddit, here comes the “they’re running this show before it comes out” crowd."
Outbreak,Didnt the writers/creators/producers just come out the other day and say a few days ago that the show would not deviate from the games?
Outbreak,Press X to doubt.  I've heard this song and dance before.  I'm talking to you Fear the Walking Dead.
Outbreak,Could they not? We know what life was like before the outbreak. Exactly like it is right now.
Outbreak,"Because that’s the exciting part, right?"
Outbreak,Fair enough but I'm really hoping it's not full of flashbacks all the time.
Outbreak,Sounds like Black Summer
Outbreak,"Bet they'll show a bunch of doubters and anti-xxx groups thinking this ""massive outbreak"" is a hoax, and they all inevitably spread the virus."
Outbreak,Last of Us had possibly the best intro of any game. I'd be interested in seeing some more build-up to the intro sequence and further exploring Joels relationship with his daughter.
Outbreak,Does anyone actually care? Life before the apocalypse is just real life.
Outbreak,"If it’s well done, I enjoy the thrill of a societal breakdown on screen. Means you have to have normal first. Like others have said though, I hope it’s not overdone."
Outbreak,I love watching the setup to fungal zombie plagues just as much as I like watching it unfolding! Yay!!
Outbreak,I hope it’s not an inundation of past scenes like they did with the Resident Evil joke of a series
Outbreak,They are gonna spend an entire episode dedicated to Sarah and make us fall in love with her before...ya know...aren't they?
Outbreak,That's called filler. It's the hallmark of a cashgrab.
Outbreak,It’s a good move for anyone who has not played the game.
Outbreak,Putting my money on the major premise being people acting like the outbreak is “fake news” up until the point that it consumes the world.  And then some.
Outbreak,“Last of us Director scrambling to make 8 hour video game a full series”
Outbreak,"oh god, they are going to make me rrrrrreally love Sarah this time. I mean, it was emotional enough losing her in the game and that was just a bit at the start!"
Outbreak,ive always wanted this. yayyyy
Outbreak,Did walmart Joel work at Walmart or target?
Outbreak,"I can’t be the only one that finds one of the favorite part of apocalypse movies/shows is the beginning where no one really knows what’s happening yet and then it’s just chaos. I’m excited to see it expanded. 

Like the baseball game in Quiet Place 2 or Rick’s hospital wake up and the Atlanta bombing in TWD."
Outbreak,So TWD with humans being the main bad guys and then zombies…wait a second
Outbreak,"I feel like hollywood has bastardized what “backstory” means. I dont need to know where Joel went to school and the childhood fights with his brother through multiple flashbacks over multiple episodes. All I need to know about him is that he was a single dad, he and his daughter had a good relationship, and his brother is close enough that when shit hits the fan they rely on each other. TLOU game set up his character beautifully in 15min, I dont see any reason to extend it. 

They could literally do a shot for shot remake of the video game and it would win multiple awards."
Outbreak,"Keep telling ya this is gonna suck. I don't want it to, but everything is pointing in the wring direction"
Outbreak,I honestly im only interested in the Life Before the outbreak on the opening scene. After that? it will probably be filler scenes to reduce costs and it honestly... doesnt look interesting to me.
Outbreak,Oh good. Because there's nothing more interesting than watching normal people go about their lives in a normal world.... *That's* the stuff *I* want to see in a zombie survival show...
Outbreak,So the least entertaining part?
Outbreak,*yawn*
Outbreak,I'm ok with this. They have to flesh things out somehow. I'd be cool with flash backs. I want to see where Bill got his magazines.
Outbreak,"4 seasons in, there is no outbreak, but they continually end each episode with a sit down at the TV when some ""big news"" is hitting the world.

And next episode, it's just some dumb shit some celebrity did. Then the writers continue on making their own creation with ""Last of Us"" in name only"
Outbreak,"My two cents: I felt that TLOU’s story was so effective because the pre-pande… errr, outbreak life of characters we followed was barely-remembered, save for a few, sharp, painful reminders of loss (like Joel’s “God, I miss coffee.”). Us seeing that in clear recollection might take away from that."
Outbreak,Saving money on FX…yay…I’m sure that won’t hurt the story at all
Outbreak,So...filler before the real story?
Outbreak,Why
Outbreak,That sounds..........horrible.
Outbreak,"Awesome... That's always what I said was missing from the game... Normal life before the outbreak.

This is basically ""we have budget for 30 minutes of CG so the other 20 minutes we just want normal shit. Also we want to avoid people watching 55 minutes of two white people walking around so this will allow us to be inclusive and diverse with our casting. Big win all around boys."""
Outbreak,"Cue protracted, soapy flashbacks to keep the budget down."
Outbreak,"I think the casting for Ellie is terrible but what really made me laugh is the director told her specifically *not* to play the video game. You know the shows gonna be flaming dog shit when the director says something as ridiculous as that. Oh don't go view any of the source material your acting for, because ? Some of the dumbest shit I've ever heard"
Outbreak,“Sigh” no spores now inventing new story before the show has even aired. Strike 1 and 2…
Outbreak,I hate this
Outbreak,Druckman going give Joel a backstory to make him into an absolute monster? Probably.
Outbreak,"Bad idea, show's a lack of confidence in the core idea. I've seen enough post-apocalyptic shows to know that you don't want to spend too much time mired in a story that's outside of the basic genre that draws people to the show. You only have so much time each episode to tell the story you want to tell. How much of that story actually takes place in this genre setting? Are people going to watch a post-apocalypse show that spends half its time in a pre-apocalyptic world? I want to see the story that plays out because of this scifi conceit, not slowly put together a character's backstory through jumbled and selective flashbacks. Let me see those character traits develop through this unique, genre based story. I can see down to earth dramas on many, many other series."
Outbreak,"Wtf 
Didn’t they say they were jus strictly adapting the games? There’s like 10 minutes of “before the outbreak” in the whole series"
Outbreak,Hope they don't do it like they did with The Passage. :'(
Outbreak,It’s going to be the first 22 episodes as life before the outbreak and the last two episodes of the season will be the initial two hours of the outbreak. I’m so excited!!!
Outbreak,Don’t care.  If it doesn’t build the characters is some new and interesting way it’s just drivel filler to make a season longer.
Outbreak,If they want to save money and go cheap why not just make the season shorter and save us from the bullshit filler backstory.
Outbreak,This feels like it's being overhyped everyday. I really hope it's good
Outbreak,The First of Us
Outbreak,"Oh great, it’s gonna be like Lost with a shit ton of flashbacks, isn’t it?"
Outbreak,"Start the episode with Joel holding Sarah at her birth.

End the episode with you-know-what."
Outbreak,"Going to skip that, not watching this show to see everyday life."
Outbreak,Can't wait to see what contemporary political issues they try to shoehorn into this
Outbreak,"So I’m gonna have to sit through at least two episodes before we get to the good stuff, great."
Outbreak,"To me, this is a red flag. The writers desperately wanted to add themselves to the story, so they found a small spot where they can."
Outbreak,Awesome :)
Outbreak,"I highly recommend The Hollywood Reporter article that came out this week, lots of news and cool stories.

https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-features/the-last-of-us-hbo-pedro-pascal-bella-ramsey-interview-1235290103/amp/"
Outbreak,How boring
Outbreak,uh oh
Outbreak,"Probably with flashbacks, or just how the show starts. Maybe like s1 of the walking dead if i had to guess. 

But we’re not here for that. The game was great in no small part because the story was good. Don’t fuck that up."
Outbreak,"Aside from character introductions I don't see a need for a pre break out existence. The main character gets a cheap coffee and gas at the local Gulf. His wife calls saying that she has a cough......crap goes south pretty quick. 

Jump to current time. Main character wishes for the old days where he could easily get cheap coffee at the local Gulf.

Basically I get it. Life was normal. We already live that now. I don't need to see it."
Outbreak,"Yes, when Hollywood runs out of idea just make it a prequel or sequel. But prequel is becoming more and more prevalent these days."
Outbreak,Sounds boring as hell. Like how they took the halo series and made it women talking to each other about master chiefs feelings
Outbreak,"For a tv show it's good to build up to certain deaths, it brings more emotion and in the game some things happened too fast.....hint."
Outbreak,"I’m not gonna lie, the trailers for this have been very underwhelming for me, and I loved the original game"
Outbreak,My biggest gripe was jumping forward immediately 20 years. Was hoping for more collapse gameplay.
Outbreak,"Flashbacks, there's not a trope I hate more than fucking flashbacks."
Outbreak,"This is gonna be shit!

Slap a remind me on this bad boy after 15th Jan."
Outbreak,I hope it happens at the start of the show instead of flashbacks throughout the show. I fucking hate flashbacks.
Outbreak, BORINGGGGGG
Outbreak,"You mean to tell me there will be BACKSTORIES

do tell"
Outbreak,"You can tell from the comments in all these TLOU threads that there's a subset of gamer bros who are going to hate this show no matter how good it is. If you're getting worked up about minor changes, you are doomed. 

Changes are good to an extent, the show has to have its own identity or else what's the point? This whole ""follow the source material"" extremism is going too far. The Witcher show, for example, isn't struggling because they deviated from source material per say, it's because the changes are poorly written. It doesn't mean changes suck in general.

If the show runners are actually passionate about the source material then they will  honor it but you have to allow them the freedom to express their own take on it or it's just a hollow retelling of the same story and what's the point of that?"
Outbreak,[deleted]
Outbreak,If it does a Lost type approach each episode i won't bother watching. I hated that method of story telling.
Outbreak,So... regular society than? Seems pretty dumb to me.
Outbreak,"This is good! The way the original game starts isn't as strong as it could be. It gets dramatic far too quickly, and major emotional scenes between characters are not yet earned. 

I think it's the biggest problem the first game has, the story just needs at least a little more time to establish the characters.

On a replay, the player is already invested in the characters and it is easy to forget this was an issue.

And as a whole, the television series should be giving us portions of the timeline the games could not, else the series be redundant."
Outbreak,[deleted]
Outbreak,This show sounds more and more like it is going to fucking suck
Outbreak,I’m so excited for this
Outbreak,"Oh?


I thought they were only interested in ‘telling the stories that were in the games’?


Lol of course not.  That’s just too hard!  Idiots"
Outbreak,"They lasted 3 days:

Outbreak,To remind us all what 2013 was like?
Together with Me,"Francesca in Better Call Saul. Could have easily been a throw away character. But she goes from such a cheery character to someone who has been beaten down so much by being in the vicinity of Saul that she's a completely different person.

Love that show"
Together with Me,"Theon in Game of Thrones

he got a real arc. He was active for as long as possible, exiting just before the show fell apart"
Together with Me,Rickity Cricket
Together with Me,Nelson Van Alden in Boardwalk Empire. He goes from prohi agent Van Alden to iron salesman George Mueller to gangster for Capone. He is crazy. And Michael Shannon stole every scene. He is so great.
Together with Me,Fitz/Simmons storyline in Agents Of SHIELD. It was the best of the show in my opinion
Together with Me,Faith from Buffy/angel
Together with Me,Pretty much everyone in the Wire! I'd go with Bubbles as my favourite but you could pick anyone
Together with Me,"Shane Vendrell in The Shield.  Holy shit what a horrible, gut wrenching arc that character goes through.  Simply put, it’s a Frankensteins monster storyline, but man is it brutal."
Together with Me,Nog on DS9
Together with Me,"I came here to answer Wesley from *Buffy*/*Angel* only to see you already did in your OP!

I'm gonna go with Ashford from *The Expanse*. A one-note villain in the books was turned into a wonderfully complex character in the show, who evolves and grows over the two seasons he appears in. Was very sad to see him go."
Together with Me,Wesley managed to go from one of the most obnoxiously cowardly characters of all time to one of the biggest badasses in TV history.  He would have been my first thought for question if you hadn't said it.
Together with Me,"Rose and Bernard on *Lost*. I loved them. Rose believed Bernard was still alive in season one, then we find out she was right in season two, and their reunion was the definition of heartwarming. Then when we find out their backstory, and that Bernard just wants to do everything he can to save Rose, it really underlines both their characters up to that point, why Rose was so serene being on the island and why Bernard was so desperate to find her and get her off the island. I was happy that once Bernard finally found out why Rose didn't want to leave the island, he completely understood why.

By the time we catch up with them in the 1977 stuff in season five, I love that they're both just ""retired,"" don't want anything to do with all the drama, and are just happy being... together. (And with Vincent!) So many characters went through so much strife, and here Rose and Bernard were just living their best lives, to the point they didn't even care if a nuke went off just because they'd at least die together.

It's not a complex, huge arc for the characters, but it's that simplicity of it that I love -- that these two found each other late in their own lives and Bernard has to learn not to waste what little time he has with Rose trying to buy more time with her, only for both to be rewarded with more time than they ever expected and cherishing every second of it."
Together with Me,"Jack Rackham from Black Sails and Camina Drummer from The Expanse. Rex in Clone Wars. Flex Mentallo from Doom Patrol. 

Also, Hawk from Cobra Kai is pretty crazy and his character can be all over the place but I still love his arc from the first season especially."
Together with Me,Colonel Talbot on Agents of SHIELD. The guy had such a incredible crazy ride on that show.
Together with Me,"Zuko 

Greatest television character arc imho"
Together with Me,Carol in the walking dead but I guess she became a main character by the end
Together with Me,Isaac in Castlevania.
Together with Me,Adriana in The Sopranos. From ditzy-but-good-natured Main Chick to putting on one of (if not) the best performances in the entire series

Together with Me,Madisynn in She-Hulk
Together with Me,"Teddy in Rectify. I thought he was going to be a one dimensional character throughout the series, but it turns out he was more nuanced than I expected."
Together with Me,"Elias or Fusco on Person of Interest


although I would classify Fusco's as ""amazing redemption arc"""
Together with Me,Broccoli through various Star Treks
Together with Me,Abed helping that couple deliver their baby in the background of season 2
Together with Me,"**Bojack Horseman** \- Diane in particular, but also Todd, Princess Carolyn, and Mr. Peanutbutter

**Crazy Ex-Girlfriend** \- especially Greg and Paula, but also Heather....I can't remember if Josh gets a satisfying arc. By the end they have such richness of character and I'm really rooting for all of them in their own endeavors.

**Insecure** \- Molly and Lawrence.

I am only considering completed shows."
Together with Me,I'm going to show my age and say Klinger from MASH.  Started out as a throwaway character and did a long arc to become one of the best characters in the series.  From a man who wears dresses to get out of the Army to a respected member of the unit.  One of the best character actors Jamie Farr.
Together with Me,Person of Interest's Carter
Together with Me,"I'll put a ""wish there was a character arc if the show hadn't been cancelled"" here.  

I really would have liked to have seen Firefly / Shepherd Book's character arc. I heard there was a comic or something about it, but that's just not quite the same."
Together with Me,Ari's arc on Entourage was far more entertaining than Vince's.
Together with Me,Juice from Sons of Anarchy. Brutal and devastating…
Together with Me,"Take your pick from Lost....

Desmond, Jin & Sun, Hurley, Charlie, Mr Eko, Richard Alpert"
Together with Me,Nelson Van Alden in Boardwalk Empire. The man went from a strict god fearing police officer to a full on gangster
Together with Me,"Inspector Morse had his sergeant/assistant Lewis clashing with his superior about police work conduct on a few occasions as well as working to get a promotion so he could lead investigations himself.

A great example of this is in the episode ""Last Seen Wearing"" where Lewis utterly rakes Morse over the coals because his boss deliberately disobeyed strict orders out of spite to being assigned to a cold case and treating it as a murder case when it was only being considered as a runaway, plus his complete callousness in the handling of the case. >!Morse's actions ends up causing it to become a murder case, but only because he presented a note he forged to someone who was shielding the missing girl who went to try and confront the girl's abuser. Morse's reaction when he learned that the woman died was to order one of the officers at the scene to raid her drinks cabinet and pour him a stiff one.!<"
Together with Me,Christopher on *The Sopranos* or Marceline on *Adventure Time*.
Together with Me,Agent Kallus in Star Wars: Rebels.
Together with Me,"Meruem in Hunter x Hunter. While he’s the major antagonist of the arc he appears in he never actually has direct conflict with the main characters, despite being his subordinate Pitou is definitely the primary antagonist narrative wise. Not only that but almost all his character development comes from his B story with Komugi, so I say it counts. 

And boy, is that B story truly beautiful."
Together with Me,Brad Bellick from Prison Break
Together with Me,"I've always been fascinated by Thaddeus Mobley, the grandfather in Fargo's season 3. After multiple viewings, I still do not understand the point of that arc, but I absolutely loved it, along with the animated short story."
Together with Me,Jack Blacks character in Community
Together with Me,"Klaes Ashford (David Strathairn)

**The Expanse** (mid-S3-S4)

An unsympathetic 2D book character re-imagined and repurposed for his television debut who, in his relatively short run on the show, would quickly become a fan favourite who would be sorely missed after he ""walked"" off the stage."
Together with Me,Bubbles in the wire
Together with Me,There was a season (maybe two) of Weeds where Andy and Kevin Nealon’s character basically had their own show. They were barely involved with Nancy’s antics.
Together with Me,VERY BEST. MR KAPLAN. BLACKLIST. SHE IS A BOSS!!!
Together with Me,"Pierce in season 2 of Community. 

Sadly after that, Harmon decided to turn him into a walking senility punchline, because he hated Chevy Chase so much. Probably rightfully, but among the many problems that the show had after season 2 and never recovered from, ignoring Pierce's arc about his place in the group, was one of the biggest."
Together with Me,"Xander in Buffy going from a sleazy incel scardey cat (who, knowing what we know now, Whedon probably didn't even consider to be sleazy) to a brave and competent adult with a huge heart"

Together with Me,"I'm not sure if this counts as not a main character but the dancing gopher in Cady Shack... Honestly, the best character in the movie, so glad he beat the gardener in the end"
Together with Me,"Father Gabriel - TWD. 

I loved his transformation."

Rose Weissman from The Marvelous Mrs Maisel
Bird Person from Rick and Morty"

Together with Me,Fitz from Agents of shield. The development and changes he goes through is extreme but also believable.
Together with Me,Landry on Friday Night Lights.
Together with Me,"Ezekiel from TWD. 

From zoo keeper, to king, to survivor. Dude is just a paladin inserted into a zombie apocalypse. Gotta love him."
Together with Me,Elsbeth Tascioni from the Good Wife and Good Fight. She was so quirky and fun. I was excited everytime she popped up.
Together with Me,Londo/G'Kar in Babylon 5. An absolute emotional roller coaster of a story.
Together with Me,Louis Litt in Suits goes from a generic antagonist to a nuance and rootable secondary protagonist by the end of the show. Such a great character.
Together with Me,"Damar from Star Trek: Deep Space Nine. 

Guy goes from unnamed Cardassian functionary #2 to leader of Cardassia and then the Cardassian Rebellion. He changes the course of the Dominon War and gets several strong scenes and he's not even a main cast member.

DS9 did really well with secondary characters in general. Garak develops a friendship with Julian Bashir, Nog goes from waiter to Starfleet Officer, even Vic the holographic lounge singer gets a pretty nice character arc."
Together with Me,Blackwargreymon in Digimon Adventure 02.
Together with Me,Vir from babylon 5
Together with Me,"You already said the one that instantly came to my mind:

Wesley from Angel, especially in season 3.

Also
Prince Zuko from ATLA
David from Travelers
Zach from Longmire"

Together with Me,Kannan from Star Wars rebels. Amazing show and a amazing arc
Together with Me,"I've never been sure if it was Saul/Jimmy that caused her to be so cynical, or if it was the types of people he dealt with that turned her dark."
Together with Me,"Also, Sandor Clegane.

Honestly my favorite character in the show. Very complex and had a very satisfying ending, even if he did die."
Together with Me,Why did he run at the night king at the end? What did that accomplish?
Together with Me,Poor guy went downhill fast. And it was nobody's fault but his own /s :)
Together with Me,This show made me a huge Michael Shannon fan. Wasn't a big fan after season 2 but I kept watching almost entirely for him.
Together with Me,"And right at the very end, he reverts back to being the straight-backed, no-bullshit agent and actually sets Capone's downfall in motion, which I thought was a great way to cap off his arc."
Together with Me,Agreed.
Together with Me,Bubbles and Prez had absolutely amazing character arcs. The latter in particular.
Together with Me,Poot's ascension to assistant manager at Foot Locker
Together with Me,One of the few happy endings.
Together with Me,"Walter Goggins is a fantastic actor, he played the part of scumbag and easily manipulated cop very well"
Together with Me,"The part where he >!drops the grenade in Lems' lap!< is just, bruh I haven't seen that scene in over 15 years and I remember it like exactly."
Together with Me,"I’m always here for praising The Shield. 

As well as Shane, Claudette has a great arc throughout the show. My favourite part is the buildup and climax with Kleavon, without spoilers it’s unforgettable and stands out in the already amazing fifth season."
Together with Me,[deleted]
Together with Me,"Consequently the whole Jake/Nog/Quark/Sisko relationship is incredibly well written, as Nog gravitates towards Starfleet and Sisko, Jake gravitates towards gossip and Quark.

The other has to watch, somewhat helplessly, as another man guides the other's one-time protege."
Together with Me,"Came here to say this.  R.I.P. Aron Eisenberg!  His segments on the DS9 documentary ""What We Left Behind"" were the best, especially when he talks about how veterans responded to his PTSD arc."
Together with Me,Also worf across both series
Together with Me,"Yes!  He and his father were both surprisingly good on the show IMO, with him in particular being great.

That show really made me love the Ferengi more than I ever thought I would."

Together with Me,Him and Fred/Illyria have a tragic yet amazing storyline throughout Angel.
Together with Me,"As long as we are talking Lost, I gotta throw Desmond and Penny in there. I'm not an emotional guy but I was gripping my blanket with tears welling up at the end of ""The Constant"""
Together with Me,I came to say Ben Linus on Lost.
Together with Me,Loved Jack and Annie together and Camino Drummer is a fantastic one!
Together with Me,I’m reading the books and it definitely feels like the authors responded to Camina’s popularity and growth on the show by taking her out of the background and making her a main character in book 7.
Together with Me,In hindsight tho im kinda disappointed the direction they went with him since now they had to recast Gen Ross instead of just replacing him with Talbot like they should.
Together with Me,Redirecting Ozai’s lighting is one of the few times I’ve ever audibly said “holy shit” in awe of a TV show

Social Syndrome,"Great write up!


I'm not familiar with most of these, and I watch a shit-ton of TV and movies. I really like the effort, and the writeups are perfect in length.


Again, not knowing these a lot, is Severance the highest ranked English speaking show? (Nothing against non English speakers of course) 


Also, I'm guessing most of these are straight drama? Language and genre might both be useful things to put in parenthesis for anyone else unfamiliar.


Totally agree with the couple from White Lotus being great characters, I much preferred season 1 (which seems like a hot take) but those two, specifically the woman, were very interesting characters to me."
Social Syndrome,"How you pick what to watch? I’m overwhelmed with all these shows in Netflix and I always seem to pick the limited series or those talked about in reddit, especially regarding to the foreign shows or K dramas. There isn’t much write-ups or reviews in English."

..................

I didn't like what 2022 television had to offer for the most part. One too many disappointments for me as well. I mean I watched a lot more shows than I did in 2021, yet struggled to find 25 new shows for this list. But I do think my top 13 here are genuinely great.But anyways, thanks a lot for reading, even if you just scrolled through this lol. Same time, same place, next year? ❤️"
Social Syndrome,"Neat list.  A lot of shows I've not seen.

A few shows from 2022 I'd recommend if you haven't seen em:

- Black Bird

- SAS Rogue Heroes

- The Offer

- Under the Banner of Heaven"
Social Syndrome,Recency bias but I just finished Yellowjackets and really had a great time watching it.
Social Syndrome,No Atlanta? Both seasons last year were incredible
Social Syndrome,Pachinko is the most slept on series of 2022
Social Syndrome,"1. She hulk
2. Ted lasso
3. Ms Marvel
4. Harley Quinn show
5. Lord of the rings
6. Spy x family 
7. Chainsaw man
8. Loki
9. Mob psycho
10. Hot D"
Social Syndrome,Which ones did you see? 🤔 amma take a wild guess and say The Bear and Severance?
Social Syndrome,"> is Severance the highest ranked English speaking show?

Yes. Even though Pachinko got a bit of english too. 

> I'm guessing most of these are straight drama? Language and genre might both be useful things to put in parenthesis for anyone else unfamiliar.

Yea. And yea I should probably do that next time."
Social Syndrome,"i just read the synopsis and glance at the preview a bit sometimes just to check visual/production quality. if it looks like something that could be potentially great, i check it out."
Social Syndrome,🙂💕
Social Syndrome,It’s great but it’s depressing.
Social Syndrome,"What other new anime from 2022 did you think were great? 

Anime for me in 2022 was, *meh* tbh. I didn't like Summertime Rendering much and Chainsaw Man hasn't gotten to the good parts of the manga yet. I was suppose to see Bocchi The Rock! before making this list, but ended up getting an ear infection so couldn't."
Social Syndrome,I'd count Yellowjackets as 2021 TV show.
Social Syndrome,on the other version of this list pinned on my profile.
Social Syndrome,"Nice! Do you often give the pilot a go before fully committed to the whole season? Any shows that you have given up midpoint? 


Like I tried to start Warrior Nun because the trailer seems fun and the lead actress looks very beautiful, also being afraid of it being cancelled (it indeed got cancelled then), but have given up after episode 6 or 7… cause the plot is very weak and the characters are laughable.


And then I tried to pick the ones that got high ratings in imdb, and started watching Extraordinary Attorney Woo and I do like it so far! Although sometimes being too cheesy at times, the acting is excellent and the stories are well-written. Highly recommended."
Social Syndrome,"Dropped Summertime after 5 minutes lol.

But personally, Bocchi the Rock is incredible TV and is my #1 show of any medium this year. And I'm not even usually into anime comedies. It's just that good, glad you're gonna try it! I'm an Attack on Titan fan after the massive story shift in Season 3, and S4P2 aired at the start of the year, although personally I don't like rating something that isn't an entire season.

Otherwise Chainsaw Man would be a decent pick even if, as you said, it hasn't quite gotten to what makes it special yet. Cyberpunk Edgerunners is one that would be worth watching and has near universal praise, and my other 2 shows to hit a 9 were Kaguya S3 (but it's not everyone), and Paripi Koumei, which I thought was an extremely passionate show but it might hit as a 7-8 for others. 

From your list I probably have to watch the 2 seasons of Tatami though. I had no idea it was well regarded I never looked into it!

Other than that though, yea there was a lot of meh. Spy Family went from potentially great to just average as it went on, LycoRyco got a lot of hype but was merely good not great (needed some writing cleanup). Personally though Dress up Darling was ok at best, and Gundam and To Your Eternity were massive disappointments"
Social Syndrome,Ignoring some great sequels I thought Chainsaw man was awesome even if it hadn't gotten to some of the good parts  of the manga. And I really liked summertime rendering (although I haven't seen the last few episodes). Lycoris recoil was fun. Spy X Family was great.
Social Syndrome,Oh my bad. I’m late to the party.
Social Syndrome,"> Do you often give the pilot a go before fully committed to the whole season?

I give everything at least 4 episodes before I decided whether it's working for me or not. Unless it's *reeeeeeeaaaaally* bad... then I quit after the 2nd or 3rd. But that rarely happens. That has only happened like 4 times in the past 3 years. 

> Any shows that you have given up midpoint?

A shit ton. 

> Extraordinary Attorney

I was suppose to watch this show too but unfortunately didn't have time for it. There are some great shows coming out of korea nowadays (3 are on this list too lol), but they require commitment with those lengthy episode counts and runtime. 

I recommend ""**D.P.**"" on netflix too if you haven't seen it. That's another outstanding one."
Social Syndrome,"> Bocchi the Rock is incredible TV and is my #1 show of any medium this year. And I'm not even usually into anime comedies. It's just that good

damn. guess i gotta hurry and check this one out now. lol."
Social Syndrome,"You should check out Kotaro Lives Alone, such a good show!"
Social Syndrome,"Heard good reviews about DP but I haven’t managed to watch it, with season 2 coming this year I may watch it soon!

For other Korean shows I watched My Name, Hellbound and of course Squid Game in 2021, which were all very good. Narco-Saints, The Glory and Somebody are shows I saved in 2022 but not started yet."
Social Syndrome,I did hear about it! I'll add it to my list thanks!
Social Syndrome,"I loved The Outside's directorial choices, the use of specific camera lenses and the angles of a lot of the shots really had a very specific and creative sense of unease and dread about them and communicated the way the protagonist never felt comfortable in her own skin."
Social Syndrome,"It's funny how different perspectives can be,

Personally I find The Autopsy to be one of the best, as well as The Outside(which we agree on) and Pickman's Model. Oh and i really enjoyed the viewing too, but i do have to agree that the ending kind of fell off even though i loved the monster. Lot 36 was my runner up to these. I'm a huge sucker for sci-fi monster type movies so all of these sort of did the trick for me(even though Lot 36 was more demonic than scifi). 

Graveyard rats I thought was okay, I liked the ending and overall it was a fun episode, but I didn't think it held up to the others listed above, the rats were cool but it's the only episode I can't rewatch as I find it absolutely the most boring to watch again for some reason, but I can watch pickmans model over and over(but I love Crispin Glover, so it may be a bias there).

Dreams in the witch house I have no opinion on. I remember enjoying it, but I also don't really recall any of the plot,and I recently rewatched them all, so overall I would say this is a pretty forgettable episode but I do remember enjoying it more than graveyard rats.

And finally, I thought The Murmuring was awful. Del Toro always does these amazing monster movies, and here we have a ghost that's borderline benevolent and the episode has way too happy of an ending. I liked the message, but did not think it fit into a Halloween based series special made by one of the best monster film makers of our time. I found it to be cliche and very much like any other ghost movie. Just with a happy ending, and personally I don't like happy endings. So it rubbed me wrong having the entire season end like that.

Overall I probably agree on your rating ~8/10"
Social Syndrome,"The Autopsy is maybe the only one I'd recommend unequivocally.  Other than that uptick I think I got less and less interested from episode to episode.

The last three were especially bad imo.  ""Dreams in the Witch House"" was not particularly scary, the story was completely pointless, and the ending was stupid as shit.  Ditto ""The Viewing"" though I enjoyed some of Steve Agee's jokes it felt like a waste of an hour.  That kills the momentum going into ""The Murmuring"" which is a good but extremely slow and melodramatic story where there's barely any horror to be found.

The biggest thing missing to me for most of them was the ""horror"" part, I didn't find most of the episodes particularly scary, so maybe that's just me and my expectations being off."
Social Syndrome,"I watched them all, but I can only remember bits and pieces.

Like there was a gravedigger guy, there was a guy who lost his sister and drank some substance to see her again.

It was all very forgettable and I wouldn't recommend any of them."
Social Syndrome,Yes. The cinematography felt very intentional and proved the story's point to a tee.
Social Syndrome,While a lot of episodes could have been better I still really enjoyed every single one. It was so much fun with such a wide variety of stories. I don't know how well the series did but I'd love a season of this every Halloween.
Social Syndrome,"That episode was the best parasite alien invasion/ body snatchers, I had ever seen. Real good."
Social Syndrome,"The Autopsy was definitely the highlight of the series. The other episodes aren't even close.

I think The Viewing is really divisive. I personally enjoyed it. 90% of it is just attempting to build tension and curiosity. If you buy into it it's a fun ride with an okay payoff, but if you don't it's pretty drab. Really they could've shortened it by 20 mind and still had the same effect.

The Witch House was absolutely awful. It felt like watching a children's show. I honestly don't understand how that made it in the show..

The whole series was honestly just underwhelming."
Social Syndrome,"I agree with that 100%, I do hope it comes back even just one more time, but I hope it did well enough to warrant being a regularly streaming Halloween special for Netflix like Stranger Things took off."
Social Syndrome,"All of us are dead…that much rating? No, it belong to the worst honestly."
Social Syndrome,"lmao that garbage korean zombie show is a 9.3 and severance only a 8.8, very questionable ratings"

Social Syndrome,"I'll admit I haven'y seen most of these, but I 100% agree with your assessments on the ones I *have* seen. Severance was like a breath of fresh air! Unique, evocative, and humanist. It asks and answers the question: what if we had the ability to manage our pain in a completely nihilistic way? Who would do it and why? The characters, the acting, the symbolisms of the color schemes, the mystery, the horror...Ben Stiller is soooo good behind the camera. And if you like his sensibilities here, check out Escape from Danemora, a biopic abt the woman who helped 2 men escape a high security prison. Also with Patricia Arquette. Ben Stiller directed. This show is one of my top 5 favs this year. 

I usually LOVE shows like From. Unfortunately, it was lacking everything you mentioned. It made a really good premise feel trite and boring :/. 

A show you didn't mention but deserves to be here is Physical on AppleTV. Omg SO GOOD. Rose Byrne (love her!) is a woman with severe eating disorder (tw) who falls into 80s aerobics stardom. It's funny, it's sad, it's entertaining, and if you are someone who has had intrusive thoughts abt your physical appearance and laments what your past decisions have cost you in your life while trying to improve your current situation, this show will speak to you.

Peacemaker is HILARIOUS and surprising. Also in my top 5 this year. Pam and Tommy was good, not great, but I was entertained enough to watch it all. Gave me a whole diff perspective on Pam Anderson and left me feeling angry that no one went to jail over the theft!"
Social Syndrome,"Don't agree with you on Bang Bang Baby. Thought it was executed magnificently but agree it could have been tighter. It was produced by the same guy who produced My Brilliant Friend and Young Pope. He also produced The King which came out this year. Think you'd love it: https://youtu.be/soami2tlDH4

Pachinko and Severance were great. The Tourist would have been great with a showrunner and writer like Steven Moffat. Could have been the British/ Aussie Fargo. Conversations with Friends was a waste of time. The book is untranslatable to screen but they still went with it. Peacemaker was great and had heart which was super surprising. Can't wait for the next season!"
Social Syndrome,"I like ""workin moms"" on Netflix.  Good 30 minute comedy."
Social Syndrome,"**THESE WERE OK:**

* Power Book IV: Force (Starz)

For a Power series I will say this Tommy Egan spinoff does do justice to the franchise's most beloved character. The tone is more consistent, the plot is more street-focused unlike the original and other spinoffs which tends to lose themselves in legal and family drama, and the show sets up a good environment for our main character to strive. His funny dialogue is still on point too of course, so is Joseph Sikora's comedic timing. The major downside here is that essentially 'Force' still very much is a Power series, and there's nothing here that you'll feel like you haven't seen before. It also comes with the same flaw as the rest of them, where it seems the plot just predictably goes around in circles, with almost all the side characters either destined for some kind of betrayal, or death.

rating: 6.7 out of 10

* Life After Life (BBC Two)

A science-fiction period-drama that follows the story of Ursula Todd, a woman in the first half of the 20th century who experiences an endless cycle of birth, death and rebirth. This premise does sound promising on paper, but the way it plays out is also the downside of watching this series. Don't get me wrong, there are times when this is fascinating, specifically the times where we watch our main character be reborn and take a different trajectory in life as an almost whole new person, as she learns from the mistakes she made in previous lives, but for a lot of its short runtime, the series really knocks you over the head with the concept, as we watch her die and be reborn again and again to the point where it becomes redundant. The visuals has its moments for a low-budget production, and there are moments where the series hits emotional marks, but by the end of it, you might be left wondering ""what exactly was the point of this?""

rating: 6.7 out of 10

* Shining Vale (Starz)

Shining Vale actually starts out pretty interesting, as a 30-minute comedy that mixes horror and psychology in quite a unique way, with witty dialogue that surprisingly never misses. But the issue is as you continue watching, there are way too many cliches here, which makes the core plot very predictable and stale. At least that's how I felt watching another show centered around the life of a writer, even if she's seeing ghosts.

rating: 6.8 out of 10

* Barons (ABC)

It's definitely something you watch more for the vibes as oppose to for the storytelling, and Barons really does capture that 70s hippie/surfer life vibe and aesthetic quite well. An Australian drama centered around surfers with a little bit of everything, from rivalries, to romances, to business, and even crime etc. Barons is mostly an easy-going type of series that pulls out the soap opera-esque moment here and there. Does it work? Well that's up to the type of mood you're in, but at times it may feel like not much is happening here until something crazy and unexpected does. And there are many different locations here as well as the story takes us from Australia, to Indonesia, to the U.S.A. (though obviously entirely filmed in Australia) with lovely beach views and surfing scenes... though at times it does feel like this series may be too ambitious for its own good. The acting is definitely a weak point, and it cause certain scenes to miss there mark, lacking that emotional punch great actors could've given them, but overall I'd say this series is a mixed bag. Enjoyable but flawed.

rating: 7.2 out of 10

* Les 7 vies de Léa (Netflix)

With quite a fun concept to work with, involving both time-traveling and body-swapping (something almost like '17 Again' or 'Freaky Friday' but not exactly), Les 7 vies de Léa is a mostly good show... but with some downsides. The good? It's entertaining, mysterious, quite unpredictable, filled with 90s nostalgia, and sets up explorations of teen mental health. The downsides? It doesn't reach the emotional and sentimental heights it obviously aims for, and that's mainly due to the script not taking time out to let the viewers get to know and connect with the suicidal main character (Lea)... that is, her life and who she was before this whole ordeal, and why she feels the way that she does. We get an in-depth look at a few others characters and their woes, but not with her, which makes the decision she makes at the end not have quite the effect that was intended.

rating: 7.0 out of 10

* Surviving Summer (Netflix)

A fun young-adult drama with some amazingly shot surf scenes (way better than the ones in Barons), which left me wondering if they used CGI. The acting is definitely a noticeable weak point, but the cast is young. And the premise, a troubled teen being sent away to an exotic location where she'll learn to be a better person, is something we've seen before, but it doesn't hinder this teen-drama filled with surf competitions from being a good enough watch.

Social Syndrome,Looks like someone still needs to watch *This Is Going to Hurt*!
Social Syndrome,Severance show
Social Syndrome,"You wildin' fam. I know that one paragraph didn't elaborate much (*plan on doing a rewatch and writing a full review sometime*), but All of Us Are Dead is fantastic! Definitely my fav of the year so far. 

Only flaws I can think of is those crappy looking moments where there's bad CGI. But visually I think those tracking shots made up for it. 

Why didn't u like it?"
Social Syndrome,lol why the hate for All -- Dead?
Social Syndrome,Thanks. I've been meaning to check out Physical (along with some other Apple TV+ originals I missed out on) but haven't gotten the chance to yet. But that show is from last year so it wouldn't be on this list anyways.
Social Syndrome,"I've never even heard of thaf show before now. But it ain't too late, I'll watch it and probably update the list."
Social Syndrome,"I don’t care for the CGI or technical issues, nor the not well acting or not very good directing. The story, the story was very bad from beginning to end. Zero originality, the only were the ones who stayed normal being zombies, they didn’t have sense. There are many better anime or manga about zombies and school, especially with better characters and relationships. The part outside also was kind of pointless and really not interesting for me. I was really bored by it. And yes kind of poor realization then. But honestly storyline and development really disappointed me. 
No offense, I mean, you said it was the best for you for this year and it’s fine of course. That was just my opinion."
Social Syndrome,"because its not good?

horrible writing, bad acting, trope infested, nothing original, not well shot... where the hell do you get a 9.3 for such a mediocre show?"
Social Syndrome,Yes but they released s2 this year =)
Social Syndrome,idk man to each his own. don't you think this was better than Highschool of the Dead though?
Social Syndrome,"I'm literally the opposite of you on this one. Maybe if you thought it was ""*ok, not great*"" i wouldn't be surprised, but ""not good""?? Did you watch the show in dub or somethn? lol. 

Sure it's not the most original thing (I even mentioned *Highschool of the Dead* in the review), and it's definitely a trope-fest, but it still had some very inventive ideas and scenes. And it might not be the most original, but it's unique in the sense that it's multifaceted. 

It's... a teen-drama more than anything, even those it has political side stories to give a fuller scope of the situation. It starts as a teen-drama, and when the Zombie apocalypse happens, it doesn't stop being a teen-drama. Their conflicts, their relationships, their love interests etc., all of this is just forced under new deadly circumstances, so you'd have to actually care about all the silly crushes and the bullying and all that before it does. That's what fuels the story. 

> not well shot

Nah this is just wrong. Did you see those tracking shots!!?? 😩

But anyway, Severance and All Of Us Are Dead is just a 0.5 difference in rating. I absolutely loved both shows. Severance definitely have the best episode out of each too (the finale). I just found a teeny bit more fault with Severance (*mainly regarding production design*), thus it being half a point less."
Social Syndrome,"No, HotD was a lot of fun, interesting, never boring or annoying, cool action scenes and cool characters as well, very enjoyable and not for the sizes of the girls."
Social Syndrome,"c'mon man. everything you just said about H.O.T.D. can be said about All -- Dead. 😅 

I like H.O.T.D. but I actually like this one a bit more because it has more emotional depth. H.O.T.D. didn't have scenes like the one where the group were leaving their final messages to their families on a camcorder, not knowing if they were still alive or if they themselves would make it. It didn't have scenes like On-jo and Cheong-san's last conversation, or On-jo watching her father get devoured, or the final scene with all of them on the roof. H.O.T.D. was a bit too focused on giving us action sequences, you couldn't connect to the characters the same way you could here the way I see it. 

And it's not just the sad parts either, I think the youthfulness that stays with the characters even while going through the worst event of their lives is what makes them whole."
Social Syndrome,Holy wall of text
Social Syndrome,I think Star Trek Enterprise would have really hit a sweetspot with the whole romulan war and stuff that would've happened had it not been canceled.
Social Syndrome,"So, CBS had a whole NCIS universe happening, and through various crossovers, it tied into the Peter Lenkov reboot universe (Hawaii Five-0, MacGyver, Magnum P.I.) as well as Scorpion.

At one point on Five-0, Kono leaves the island to go hunt sex traffickers, never ti return. IRL, her departure was tied to a contract dispute (fuck the producers, she deserved the raise, but that's another story).

However, it would have been so cool to have a massive, season-long crossover event where Kono went coast to coast chasing those traffickers, guest starring on the various shows in the shared universe as she continued her hunt. She could have teamed with NCIS: LA, then gone elsewhere in California with Team Scorpion, petitioned the Phoenix Foundation (MacGyver) to help somewhere, stopped in New Orleans, and made her way to Washington to come all the way back to the original NCIS. 

Epic fucking fail, CBS."
Social Syndrome,"I wish that Harper's Island had spawned a series of ""who-dun-it"" type shows where the fans could interact online with different clues as to who the killer was. That was the original idea behind the show but it only had one season and very few viewers.

I always thought there was a lot of room to grow a show where each season was a different mystery and you could go online to their website and look for clues, interact with other fans, watch video shorts, etc.

I still haven't seen a show do this, and I think there is a huge missed opportunity here."
Social Syndrome,"1. Friends - Ross should've stayed together with Emily. They seemed to be more equal , have more in common. Ross and Rachel made ZERO sense. I think if Emily stayed it would've been refreshing for the show which got stale at that point. 

2. LOST - the mystery of ""What's the deal with Walt?"" never got addressed satisfactorily and IMO, was one of the more tantalizing mysteries on the show 

3. Dawson's Creek - Andi was by far more interesting than Joey or Jen ever was. She should've stayed with Pacey. And i think they should've gambled by writing off one group of characters and following the other - either have Dawson go to USC and retool the show to focus on his time there OR write out Dawson and follow Pacey/Joey in Boston. 

4. Felicity - Season 1 was fantastic. The rest sucked. Felicity never really grew as a person. She ended the way she started. She should've dated Noel and stuck to art. I would've written off Megan, Elena, and Sean early on. And frankly, write out Ben - he clearly was failing school, didn't belong."
Social Syndrome,"Quantum Leap should've gone through with it's planned crossover with Magnum PI

And while never planned like that one was... Murder She Wrote and Columbo should've also had a crossover."
Social Syndrome,Star Trek Picard should have really killed off Picard at the end of season one. Rios’ ship should have then been renamed “The Picard”.  Any seasons after that would follow the adventures of Rios and the rest of the gang without Patrick Stewart.
Social Syndrome,Jackie and Hyde should have stayed together.
Social Syndrome,"In Doctor Who, The Doctor and Master's relationship should have evolved after season 10 when Missy wanted to join his side. The character had a clear progression in that season, so I wish he didn't revert back to 'hehe I am evil and I just want your attention' psycho that we saw in Season 12. Of course, the characterisation of the Master is the least of the problems with that run of the show, but it really upset me how they flushed down one of the better character arcs for the sake of cheap villainy. He could have been a friend/advisor/companion/rival. Many things really."
Social Syndrome,"A Faith the Vampire Slayer spin off could have been amazing. The rumored concept of Faith travelling from town to town like the Littlest Hobo would have made for a cool niche of its own between Angel's big city LA and Buffy's small town Sunnydale, well predating Supernatural & Co, but could also have been used to function as essentially an anthology. I think she would have been a really interesting character to see out there, cut off from any better or worse influences, and having no safe havens or support systems to lean on. 

It would have allowed for a huge amount of storytelling flexibility, and the format would also have played to Eliza Dushku's strengths way better than Dollhouse. 

The only caveat is that I was never sure Whedon (all else aside) really understood the character's appeal. A lot of her best moments/episodes were steered by other writers.

Supposedly it was proposed to Dushku but she was afraid of being typecast."
Social Syndrome,"Grimm should gave left both love interests as they were(no redemptions, stay dead, etc), and stuck to no magic, everything being biochem/bio stuff"
Social Syndrome,"The Flintstones had success with the future spin off, The Jetson, but I feel a current day spin off would have garnered the same sort of success as The Simpsons. Being able to reference current events in the jokes would have given the show a lot wider appeal than the predecessors."
Social Syndrome,OP should have picked one example…
Social Syndrome,"yea, i just upvoted n scroll down to the comments. lol. don't have time to read all that sorry OP. 😅"
Social Syndrome,Sometimes I feel like the only person who really liked Star Trek Enterprise. The Romulan War would have been amazing :(
Social Syndrome,"Yeah, they should've been focusing entirely on the Romulans and the first steps into the Federation from the very beginning.

Not that Temporal Cold War crap."

Social Syndrome,"Dan and Roseanne Connor are the best TV couple of all time.

 I have some friends that remind me of this couple. As annoying as Roseanne is, she's not unbearable like most TV wives. Dan's not portrayed as a moron.. The couple has an unmatched chemistry that isn't normally found on television.

The drama that the two went through felt real. As  loud and annoying as they were, they weren't constantly nagging at each other about petty shit. Neither came off as ungrateful for the other.

Dan doesn't treat Roseanne like she's a moron. Roseanne doesn't demand constant attention from him. Dan's not constantly scheming to pull one over on Roseanne. She's not trying to make him into the man she thinks he can be and lets him be the man that she is.

The only ""flaw"" in their characters is they're not attractive. They're middle aged fatties from the midwest.

The most enduring quality in this couple is the fact that the love the characters have for each other really comes through the TV screen. Unlike Ray and Debora, Penny and Leonard, Ross and Rachel, Doug and Kerri, or any other TV couple you're not left wondering WTF do they see in each other. They're a perfect match for each other."

The Collector,"I still buy physical discs too. It sucks when streaming services take shows away, like HBO Max recently did with Westworld. I rather own them on disc, forever."
The Collector,"The worst part about it is the loss of bonus features. For TV shows I really loved to re-watch, I would always listen to commentary, watch deleted scenes and outtakes, and the extras/featurettes.

It's sad that there doesn't seem to be much of an effort from any of the services to get this stuff streaming, not only with TV shows but movies too."
The Collector,"Yeah, I miss the heyday of DVD back in the 2000s, when “complete series” DVDs became the norm. Especially those “brilliant but cancelled” TV shows that only lasted one season. Built up quite a collection of one-season wonders."
The Collector,"I'm not a collector but after the mess with HBO and Netflix deleting shows, I decided to buy some of my favorites on Blu-ray just to be safe. And yeah it was rough

I wound up having to order some of them from like ... Amazon Singapore"
The Collector,"Actually what depresses me is seeing [how few new blu-ray player models](https://www.bestbuy.com/site/searchpage.jsp?id=pcat17071&qp=category_facet%3DBlu-ray%20Players~abcat0102003&st=blu-ray+players) and [drives](https://www.bestbuy.com/site/searchpage.jsp?st=bluray+drive&_dyncharset=UTF-8&_dynSessConf=&id=pcat17071&type=page&sc=Global&cp=1&nrp=&sp=&qp=category_facet%3DSAAS%7EExternal+Blu-ray+Drives%7Epcmcat340400050008&list=n&af=true&iht=y&usc=All+Categories&ks=960&keys=keys) there are out there to purchase. Your media library is only good for as long as there are optical drives to be had to play them.  I mean, try and find a way to play an S-VHS tape or laserdisc these days...

Once your player dies, is your physical media still going to be useful to you, if you can't buy a replacement device to play them...?"
The Collector,There is a thrift store down the street that sells blurays for 1 buck each so I have been building up the library.
The Collector,"I'm always happy when something gets a physical release in this day and age, but I won't pretend I'm not pissed when a show that would benefit immensely from blu-ray only pops up on DVD.

*Elementary* was such a detail-oriented show, blu-ray would be such a benefit. Shows like the *Magnum PI* reboot have such lush scenery filmed in high-def, it would be gorgeous on blu-ray. But no, companies just being cheap. There are countless others.

What really grinds my gears? Releasing a whole series on blu-ray EXCEPT for the final season. *Blindspot, Strike Back,* a few others... own them all on blu-ray except for that single weird season. Goddamn asinine."
The Collector,I’ve been dying for a bluray of Buffy forever.  A proper remaster while retaining the intended 4:3 resolution.  It’ll never happen unfortunately.
The Collector,"This is why piracy is so attractive. You get a copy you get to keep and nobody can take it away from you.

The industry is once again shooting itself in the face and the balkanization of the streaming apps and the inconsistent availability of TV and movies means the second golden age of sailing the seas is probably just around the corner..."
The Collector,"I don't buy movies but I do buy music and let me tell you, it's beginning to look the same over there."
The Collector,Imagine the people that collects laser disc . . .
The Collector,"Maybe I’m wrong, but I think physical discs will eventually make a comeback thanks to nostalgia. There seems to be an increased demand for things like physical books and records; two mediums that I thought for sure were on their way out based on technology.

I’ve personally increased my physical blu ray spending this past year because I don’t trust streaming services. I think making discs into more collector pieces with extra features, nice artwork and additional add-ons (booklets, pins, etc) will help keep the format alive Vs just “here’s a copy of the movie.”"
The Collector,"I try to physical whenever I can but it's becoming difficult. Sucks, man."
The Collector,"I recall my friends always mocking me for buying dvd's and blu-rays and such, when I could instead just download or stream them. It seemed to suddenly stop when they had no access to internet for 2 weeks and came crawling back to me."
The Collector,"I’d seriously settle for just the episodes in full HD format with zero other features at this point. I get that they want to sell you the streaming services, but when there’s not even a dvd of a show… I can’t get half these streaming services were I live. So yeah, that’s money they’re just not getting at all from me period.

It’s sad but I keep thinking ‘man, if only they had print on demand for Blu-ray’s of tv shows’."
The Collector,"I don't think Blu-ray's for tv shows have ever sold well, there still seems to be plenty of physical releases for DVDs though."
The Collector,"The HBO Max mess was a bit of a wake up call to me. Yes, it's depressing how hard it is to get some stuff on Blu Ray and the barebones releases vs what used to be standard are miserable."
The Collector,"I hear ya - the disc that made me fall in love with BluRay was season 1 of mad men. I have no idea why I had that BluRay, but my god it was beautiful"
The Collector,Also the audio on disc is often better than streaming. It's painful
The Collector,"I’m having this issue right now.
I live in the UK, so my only access to HBO shows is locked to NOW TV (when they don’t get removed intermittently.) HBO produce some beautiful, fantastic shows. Id love to own Euphoria, but it’s currently locked to (as well as recently released) DVD set of both season 1, or 2. Now, I’m not a DVD snob… but I don’t want to pay premium blu-ray prices for DVD’s. Especially for a show that I think would benefit from a higher fidelity.

I’m just hoping we get The Last of Us on 4K!"
The Collector,Time to embrace Rogue Archiving.
The Collector,"I get what you mean, I collect all MCU films on Blu-Ray, but the collection will never be complete because they won't release the Disney+ Originals on the format. I would love to get them with some deleted scenes or behind the scenes commentary or something."
The Collector,"I've been collecting *DVDs* for like nearly 20 years (oh god I'm old). And I still buy DVDs for my collection but it has gotten soooo much harder. And you don't get high quality boxsets, bonus features, or even menu screens anymore, and a lot are Make-on-demand.   
But I'm in too deep to stop (or change format) now..."
The Collector,"One very major problem that I have with streaming is one of video and audio quality - due to the heavy compression used for streaming this drastically lowers the quality compared to Blu-ray.

Now I realise many won't care, as long as the quality is 'good enough' then that's all that matters, right? It's quick and convenient (except when the streamer loses the rights to broadcast the show (or movie) that you're watching or plan to watch .....). 

And what about 4K streaming, that's even better, right? Not when compared to a 4K disc it isn't.

You can try and prise my Blu-rays (and DVDs) out of my cold, dead, hands, but at least I own the discs and can watch them whenever I choose. I can even re-sell them if I like, try doing that with a digital purchase."
The Collector,"It gets really depressing when you think about movies and TV shows getting less likely physical releases than there used to be. I keep having this wishful thinking that there will be a change because of people getting tired of streaming services pulling their bullshit (related to original stuff or otherwise), but it seems the only people worried about the loss of physical are us collectors.

Aside of original shows or movies not even having the chance of being released on blu-ray, some companies keep neglecting the bonus features they once used to take care of to make their products more appealing to fans. It's so sad."
The Collector,"Streaming makes everything feel a lot more disposable, I find. Like you're only meant to watch them and forget about them the minute the credits roll. I also think the decline of physical media is one of those things that hurts the artist far more than anything else."
The Collector,"I'd like the industry to start publishing movies on read-only flash drives. They wouldn't need to be the densest or fastest storage. A 4K BD is only 100GB at 144mbps. Even USB 2.0 can handle that. Longevity wouldn't even be an issue with read-only, no write ops to wear it down. Easy to encrypt to licensed players/software to keep the distributors happy. They could even get creative with collector's edition modeled drive shells."
The Collector,"ever since streaming decided what we were allowed to see i make my own copies on multiple formats.  yeah they just remove any episodes they see fit some i can kinda understand and others are just because they can.

several shows and movies are on my hard drive.  a external drive and my blu ray burner died so gotta wait to get a new one to continue making my own blu rays.

if you enjoy something make it your responsibility to preserve it.  The age of streaming has put us back in the days of vhs and no internet for saving stuff.

with a flick of a switch or a click of a mouse how many shows would be lost forever without piracy to save them?

Do what you must to save what you love"
The Collector,"Yeah, I'm with you. I run the subscription-based https://tvshowsondvd.substack.com/ newsletter, posting info about what TV-DVDs/BDs come out in the USA (and a few in Canada, since it's the same region and can be imported). I posted a ""Roundup"" every Friday morning of what's been announced in the past week, and on Tuesday mornings I post a ""Reminder"" of everything coming out that day. I'm not here trying to ""advertise"" by mentioning that. I'm merely saying that the lists I post all the time are just getting smaller and smaller.  

And many titles that DO get released are on DVD-only, no Blu-ray, because DVD still outsells Blu-ray on same-title purchases about 6 to 1. It's all so painful. I hate knowing that if Disney (or Fox) owns a show, it will almost certainly never get a physical disc release.  

I keep hoping for a push-back against the whole streaming thing, and a return to physical media...like we saw with vinyl records! Might happen, the way Netflix and HBO Max and other streaming services are pissing off SO many of their customers. I guess we'll have to wait and see."
The Collector,theres no money in season 32 of ice road truckers.
The Collector,Y’all need Plex and a pirate ship.
The Collector,I've been waiting on a 4k Leftovers box set but I dont think that show did well enough ratings wise to justify it. But i would at least settle for a readily available normal blu ray box set.
The Collector,"It's a shame it's not financially viable to do boutique labels for TV the way there are for film.

Criterion/Arrow/Vinegar Syndrome/Severin and the smaller labels are a veritable golden age of physical media."
The Collector,"The worst is when they release like half the show or on alternate formats. 

Like Succession S1 was released on blu ray- S2 & S3 were only released on DVD.

The Expanse only was released up to season 4.

AT LEAST FINISH THE JOB YOU BASTARDS."
The Collector,There should be a service where a company lets you overpay for custom bluray production. Maybe make it kickstarter-esque where fans can commit to reach a certain threshold in order to do small production runs on shows if it doesn't make sense to do them one at a time. Production companies/distributors obviously get their cut but don't have to rely on the shrinking economics of physical media. Make all the releases nice steelbook designs too.
The Collector,"To be fair, there's never been a big selection of TV on BD, Fox barely released anything and the only studio worse than them was Disney and now they're the same. There was a time when fewer shows were released, but it has been getting a little better. Obviously if a show is made for a streaming service, they're not going to want to put it on disc because they see it as competition which is stupid. Most people are going to still subscribe for other content even if they buy a show they like."
The Collector,"100% agree with you, OP. Television on physical, especially bluray, has been on a downward spiral since 2016. My 600+ bluray collection has stagnated these last few years after I decided to just download 4K HDR digital stuff since there was no bluray releases.

* Shows that released complete season in a single box/case for their first X number of seasons started to get their physical releases split into two. Suits released S1-5 in one case, but season 6 started the trend of separating the releases into Part 1 and Part 2. And at least in Australia, both parts costs the same @ AUD$35 each (at launch price). The stinger here is that the whole seasons used to also cost AUD$35. Then we were forced to spend twice that amount to get the entire season. My Suits collection stopped at season 5 because of this.
* Shows like Ray Donovan, Billions, Succession, etc, that had their first season/s released on bluray no longer had bluray releases for their later seasons. Truly bizarre since Billions & Succession had 4K HDR/DV digital releases. It was just logical to have at least a bluray release.
* The Expanse doesn't look like it's going to be getting physical releases for the last 2 seasons. Seasons 1-3 were released on bluray in Australia which was fine. Season 4 has a bluray release but isn't available in brick & mortar stores outside of the USA. The only thing we can do is import it. Seasons 5 & 6 don't have any physical releases.
* Breaking Bad was never clear as to whether S5 was a single season of 16 episode or 2 seasons of 8 episodes. The Wikipedia says there's only 5 seasons but my bluray collection has 5 seasons + ""The Final Season"" effectively making 6 seasons. Both S5 and The Final Season were full price (surprised).

There's more but I'm too mad to list any more out."
The Collector,I think people stopped buying (in general) and that’s why stuff stopped being released.
The Collector,"I would really love a BD release of Arcane, with a lot of behind-the-scenes content, I also would buy the CD of the fantastic soundtrack.

There are also movies that are not released on physical media, like PREY.

I understand streaming is way cheaper for media companies but I'm not convinced we BD aficionados are just a tiny dying breed."
The Collector,"I had a collection of about 80 and had to sell them. I've just been buying stuff on Amazon for a while now. I'm pretty sure that if Amazon starts shutting down, I'll know and can take appropriate actions to store my digital purchases if the company doesn't allow me to claim it in any way."
The Collector,"Even with DVDs before streaming, there were companies who wouldn't release stuff. Third party companies would get the rights and release them sometimes. Then there were even companies who were basically like, go buy them digitally. It's not all to blame on streaming but streaming does exasberate the ""problem""."
The Collector,"Absolutely!  I’ve always preferred physical ownership as digital ownership always carries the risk that they’ll remove that title from their library.  To say nothing of the loss of commentary tracks, making-of info, gag reels, alternative endings, deleted scenes etc.  I don’t want to have to subscribe to 4 or 5 services on the off chance I want to watch a particular movie when it pops into my head. 

Recently I was in Costco and asked the electronics guy if they sold blu-Ray players and I might as well have asked for a cotton gin.  He suggested I try a pawn shop.  I felt somewhat insulted."
The Collector,"Step 1.) Buy Blu-Ray burner  
Step 2.) ????  
Step 3.) Profit!"
The Collector,I mean physical media is dying has been dying and will die even more. I think you guys need to get past this.
The Collector,"Its fun too havea blu-ray or cd but, there will be less waste in the future. So i can live without"
The Collector,Being an 8-track collector has gotten really depressing as a music fan. Most stuff just doesn't get an 8-track release anymore.
The Collector,I started collecting blu-ray ten years ago and even then it felt like it was dying.
The Collector,"Check out Goodwill, EBay. I also like to have discs. Don't you just love how movies turn into rentals during the holiday season, if they're at all applicable?"
The Collector,Record what you want.
The Collector,"While the quality for sound and video is certainly welcome in blu-ray releases when I end up ripping them for my media server I’m actually a LOT more thankful for DVDs! 😂 Granted though, costs for large HDDs are dropping so getting some extra space wouldn’t be as much of a wallet burner as it used to be."
The Collector,I still get the 4k's or Blu rays as I can.  I really don't like streaming. The video quality sucks compared to a disc.  And I liked all the making off stuff on b-movies and genre films. Companies like Arrow and MVD and Shout/Scream still put out good stuff.
The Collector,"I went from huge shelves of movies to a stack of hard drives. Took weeks to rip my collection but now almost all my dvd/blurays are in my storage shed. Then use plex/emby to self stream. It doesnt help that not all the digitial releases have the specials but some still do so I have those under extras in the folders, but IF it has specials I try to make sure I have them too."
The Collector,"I’m typically a physical collector, but TV shows are the exception to my rule. I don’t need all those discs taking up space on my shelf and the convenience of jumping from season to season without getting up is worth it to me. 

I’ve actually been buying TV shows on Apple TV as a way to cut back on streaming services. I just picked up several shows on sale. Frasier, Brooklyn Nine-Nine, Andy Griffith Show were all $30 each over the holidays. 

Really I just need stuff for background noise and to fall asleep to. Movies I always want the best possible media format."
The Collector,"Completely agree. I'd love the D+ Stsr Wars series on blu-ray, so frustrating."
The Collector,You'd think Netflix would love the added income of someone buying the content they could just watch on their service.
The Collector,That's true for old stuff too. *Pete and Pete* is practically lost media at this point.
The Collector,Someone should sell bootleg Patriot blurays (Amazon show)
The Collector,VHS collecters said the same.
The Collector,Its like.... streaming is the future...
The Collector,"No depressed collectors here. Embrace the world’s technological progress, you’ll be much happier!"
The Collector,"Look at it this way, you are on your way to become an antique collector."
The Collector,The library typically has them.
The Collector,"Pirate, burn to disc."
The Collector,"Yep.

With Doctor Who being hot potato’d back and forth I invested in much of the new series (waiting on 13 to get a complete series release) and been slowly growing my classic collection as they come since my options are limited in terms of streaming since they took it off Netflix."
The Collector,"My stuff gets bumped around so rather than playing hot potato, I just grab what I can so I don’t have to excel sheet where everything went, like Doctor Who that’s getting bumped to D+ from HBO Max sometime in the near future. 

I wish these companies have the same realization as the record companies  did and not divvy up the streaming sphere so damn much >_> but they won’t and I don’t feel one bit for them."
The Collector,The commentary for Futurama is such a wonderful experience.
The Collector,"thank you for saying this, i have had so many debates with people who argue that having a dvd / bluray collection is ""a waste of space"" and all that.  personally i will always miss the 3+ hours of documentaries and interviews."
The Collector,The commentaries on the *Leverage* disks were a freaking showrunning master class.
The Collector,This is why I started buying discs again. Also to cut down on services where I was re-watching comfort shows. The Veep commentaries have been an amazing experience. Too bad only a few of the seasons are on Blu-ray
The Collector,YouTube is great for bloopers
The Collector,One of the best extra features I've seen was the commentary for Mickey Donald Goofy: The Three Musketeers https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fBUdArzbi0&t=476s
The Collector,"I don't miss rebuying those DVDs in widescreen format, and then Blu-ray, and then 4k Blu-ray... Such a huge waste of money."
The Collector,"I loved getting Firefly, Tru Calling, Witchblade, Roswell, Birds of Prey, Millennium, Forever Knight, the early-'90s shows Dark Shadows and The Flash, Law & Order: Trial by Jury."
The Collector,Imagine if you had to travel to a supernatural universe just for DVDs.
The Collector,Isn't that just a HBO thing? I don't recall Netflix deleting shows.
The Collector,[deleted]
The Collector,You can buy the tv shows online though
The Collector,"I imagine gaming consoles probably discourage companies from making dedicated blu-ray players. 

Cuz I'm looking at those players and if you somewhat game even seldomly a Xbox One S makes more sense then pretty much all those players.

Granted I know dedicated players have better PQ than consoles but most consumers don't care nor have a 2k television for it to make a visible difference."
The Collector,"I have a VCR/DVD player. Also have the original Star Wars 3 movie pack VCR release. Before George Lucas decided to tinker with them. Unfortunately, this model Panasonic comes with copy protection software, so I can't copy copyright material. I had originally asked for an earlier model without copyright software, but the gift giver couldn't comprehend not buying the newest."
The Collector,Ion makes products that can convert media to digital. I have their turntable. Hook it up to my computer and it will convert the vinyl into digital. They also make a product for VCR's
The Collector,"That’s why I bought a second identical player to be kept mint in box as a backup if/when my current, fantastic Panasonic UHD player will give up the ghost."
The Collector,I've still got my first dvd player and it works great. Do these things ever go bad? My Sony blu ray players must be at least 12 years old.
The Collector,*Legion* is really vibrant and some great cinematography. Unfortunately only season one is on Blu Ray. Seasons 2 & 3 are only on DVD. I’m tempted to get them anyway since I think FX has no intention of doing more than the bare minimum. Shame cause it’s a show that’d benefit from something like a 4K release.
The Collector,"I really like my Star Trek TNG blurays, but it wasn't an easy production for the studio. All the visual effects were done on VHS, whereas the original footage was on film. All the visual effects had to be redone or they'd look terrible compared to the rest of the footage. Not such an issue when broadcasting to TV's of the time. 

I wonder how many other shows were affected in a similar way? Perhaps might explain why some never got HD releases."
The Collector,"Indeed. It's why I just stick to my original DVD releases, warts and all."
The Collector,"When I was in uni, I did some research on piracy in Australia. In Australia, piracy dropped sharply once Netflix launched, and it was *largely* those shows like Game of Thrones where distribution to Australia was prohibitively expensive (the only way to watch it legally back then was to pay something ridiculous like $35/mo for Foxtel), non-existent, or delayed by several months that Australians pirated. Overall it was much lower, though.

These days, because of exclusivity contracts and the fragmentation of the streaming market, media piracy in Australia is pretty much back to where it was before, if not higher. Netflix was once sort of like Spotify (which largely eliminated music piracy other than a few niche cases) for TV shows and movies, with everything in one place, but now that's totally gone."
The Collector,[deleted]
The Collector,"You can also buy from a site like youtube, or Microsoft, and own it digitally forever.

If you're afraid of them taking it down one day, you can use a screen recorder to save the movie for later.

As long as you don't distribute it, you can just save it to a USB or hard drive, and most devices should be able to play it."
The Collector,I think you're overestimating how many viewers care. TV and movies have become consumables. People watch once and move on to the next thing.
The Collector,"I swear there's a new one every day. We slowly collected logins and payed for a couple ourselves. Last night we wanted to rewatch Dexter, but oh no now fucking Showtime has their own service which of course is the only one with Dexter. I also got an email this week from HBO saying they are raising my monthly price from 15 to 16 a month. It's all cable again"
The Collector,"I don’t think books have ever been at risk, IMO. If there’s ONE medium that is arguably necessary/preferable in physical form - it’s the written word."
The Collector,"Indeed. Personally it breaks my heart Disney is so damn stubborn we'll probably never get official physical releases for Kenobi, Season 7 of The Clone Wars, or The Mandalorian."
The Collector,If you have them downloaded then it does it matter if you have internet or not.
The Collector,"that sounds incredibly dumb

what stopped them from downloading a show on a streaming app for offline use?

you can find wifi in any public place nowadays"
The Collector,Right? 😂 Or even movies when you're in the no reception outdoors.
The Collector,HBO's Blu-rays tend to sell pretty well.
The Collector,I have not had HBO Max in a while.. what was the mess about?
The Collector,"The seasons have been released by Warner Archive (pressed discs, not BD-R). based on a quick search they all seem to be readily available at Amazon at the moment, even though they are about $20-25 because of the small-batch production.

There is a complete series set as a European import, but you may need a Region B-compatible or codefree player."
The Collector,Yeah Matt Damon in an interview also talked about how the death of the DVD /Bluray market has had a huge impact on the type of movies that get made today. Mid-budget movies that may not do big numbers at the box office but would do wel on DVD just don’t get made today.
The Collector,"""but I'm not convinced we BD aficionados are just a tiny dying breed.""

But you are. Otherwise there would be way more talk about this around."
The Deadline,Well that's great news
The Deadline,Did “The White Lotus” really have more to say? I feel like its story ended.
The Deadline,If Anthony Starr doesn't win for Homelander ...
The Deadline,"I thought The White Lotus was average at best, Armond carried it.

Hyped for more Barry & Succession."
The Deadline,[deleted]
The Deadline,Y'all reminded me that The White Lotus existed and now I'm in a bad mood. That ending was so wack. Such a waste. 🤦
The Deadline,Fantastic. And a lot sooner than expected.
The Deadline,How tf are they going to continue Barry? I thought the arc was completed perfectly at the end of S3
The Deadline,Barry was pretty awful this season. It really lost its magic in the long gap between Season 2 and 3.
The Deadline,They're doing it like an anthology series.  The next series takes place with different characters at a different white lotus. I think season 2 is in Italy.
The Deadline,"Then he'll laser every last fucking one of you, goddammit!"
The Deadline,"damn I loved White Lotus, there was so much tension for absolutely no reason and it worked for me, I thought they all had something but Armond was definitely my favorite. Succession also a favorite"
The Deadline,"It's nowhere near the level of Barry and succession, to say the least."
The Deadline,I dropped White Lotus after a couple episodes
The Deadline,"I watched 20 minutes from the first episode and I just stopped, it is so incredibly boring."
The Deadline,"Same.  White Lotus wasn't a big hit for me, but I absolutely adored every scene with Armond.  I hope to see him (the actor) in more things."
The Deadline,The article didn't say it would end with season 4. Casey Bloys said it was up to Jesse Armstrong and gave no answer.
The Deadline,I loved the show.
The Deadline,"Just end with him getting arrested? No closure with Sally? No real conversation to settle things with the Fonz? No revenge on Fuchs?


The police don't really have much on him. Just pointing a gun and not pulling the trigger. Might even get bail before his trial. And wasn't the gun given to him outside the house by a police informant? Could potentially be entrapment."
The Deadline,"I mean, it would kinda work as a series finale but there are definitely more great stories to mine."
The Deadline,"Lol, it was the best season and had 2/3 of the best episodes in the series."
The Deadline,Except Jennifer Coolidge is still her character which is a great choice.
The Deadline,Aubry Plaza joins the cast too.
The Deadline,Sicily
The Deadline,Hopefully it doesn’t turn out like True Detective season 2.
The Deadline,The soundtrack was *perfect* for setting the atmosphere and keeping tension high.
The Deadline,The White Lotus is a masterpiece.
The Deadline,Way to base an entire show on the first 20 minutes…
The Deadline,I loved the show too until that wack ass ending.
The Deadline,Him pointing a gun at the guy with his back turned wouldn’t be entrapment.
The Deadline,"I thought Sally packing up and leaving Hollywood was a perfect ending for the character, albeit a bit bleak (which fits the show)."
The Deadline,The Fonz? You mean Barry Zuckerkorn?
The Deadline,"I saw it as sally finally realizing he is a monster & breaking away for her own good (she now being forever affected by him after the apt scene),Fuchs & Barry both being nabbed after refusing to change their ways after so many chances. I mean other shows have done more with less. I just felt like it wasn’t a cliffhanger or anything he got what he deserved & lost everything after having every chance to fix it"
The Deadline,Love it
The Deadline,That's great news but to be fair that's really her only character lol
The Deadline,"What! Didn't know this, this will probably be awesome"
The Deadline,Holy shit after black bear im all aboard
The Deadline,"THAT is a perfect addition to the vibe….Idunno what it was exactly about white lotus that I loved.  I guess the off beat comedy stuff is a bit hit and miss for different folks, but for me it was a HUGE hit…"
The Deadline,yes! the soundtrack was great - it added a lot to it
The Deadline,"I mean is it? That is an entire episode for a sitcom, and 2 episodes for an animated tv show nowadays, it did nothing for me during that time. And the premise didn't grab me either."
The Deadline,Love this comment until the wack ass ending. 🤣
The Deadline,The ending was pretty shocking which contributed to making it good.
The Deadline,"Due to them not having any real hard evidence on Janice, it could be argued that Gene and Jim provoked a combat veteran into an act of violence. Since Barry loves Gene, it would be fair to say that if he was made to believe that Jim wanted to hurt either of them over what he *thinks* happened to Janice, it could trigger Barry to do something drastic."
The Deadline,"A police informant called him to the scene, gave him the gun, and asked him to go shoot someone

Who knows how Barry will end up playing it, but the writers built enough of a foundation for an entrapment plot if that’s the way they want to go 

Barry kind of plays with reality a little bit sometimes and has such an absurdist view of the world that I’m not sure we can really anticipate what they will do, however"
The Deadline,"Yeah, it didn't go 100% there but it was as close to a Paul Thomas Anderson TV series as you can get."
The Deadline,First episodes are almost always the most boring. It's always about character introduction and setting the scene. You must miss out on a lot of good shows with that approach.
The Deadline,what?! 😂😂 bruh u tryna be funny?
The Deadline,Meh that’s not even close. Gene even told him not to go in there.
The Deadline,"I miss out on a lot of 7/10 shows, because the really good stuff starts strong from episode 1, or presents an interesting premise."
The Deadline,"Sheitt, 7/10 is good enough for me."
The Deadline,"With how much entertainment there is nowadays I feel like watching a lot of 7/10 shows would be a waste of my time, at least that is how I look at it because I also like doing other things such as playing video games, watching movies, rewatching stuff I really liked and reading books."
The Deadline,I’m with you on 7/10 but first episodes are not a great way to judge shows. Like the first ep of that show is about 7/10 while the other eps are all pretty much 8/10. And for many other shows the gap is much bigger. Like Parks and Rec and Schitt’s Creek’s first seasons were much weaker than the rest of the show. Same with Seinfeld and The Office.
The Deadline,I'm not going to give him shit for it because did anyone actually expect him to finish?
The Deadline,"Personally I'm resigned to the fact that I'll be watching the song of ice and fire story conclude on HBO. I love the books, but I also love the show and am not going to stop watching it. I'll just read last two novels when I have time to get around to them, get my GoT fix from the show in the meantime."
The Deadline,[deleted]
The Deadline,Fans of the show are not bugged cause they already know that the show has left the books behind. George admitted that he told the producers the broad strokes of what was going to happen ages ago and the producers are taking their own road there. So George can get around to his version whenever 
The Deadline,"Don't sweat it George, its a TV show now."
The Deadline,It's just his fans going through the 5 stages of grief. 
The Deadline,"We waited 10 years for essentially a 2-part book that ended up further convoluting the plot, so at this point we'll take having the books finished in our lifetime over having any other kind of expectations. "
The Deadline,The final stage is Acceptance.
The Deadline,Is anyone surprised GRRM received nothing but supportive messages on his heavily moderated blog comments? 
The Deadline,"well, i for one can't wait to read george rr martin's adaptations of david benioff and dan weiss' game of thrones seasons 6 and 7."
The Deadline,"This is a ridiculous concept.  His not-a-blog is so heavily moderated that only the sycophants and asskissers are allowed to post there, any negative commenters get blocked and banned. 

The truth is that all you can say to GRRM at this point is ""ok, whatever, george, take your time"" or to honestly tell him how he has ruined his life's work and his legacy and be incredibly mean to him without even trying to be mean. And his ""I'm not finished yet"" post already read like a suicide note, its probably best not to kick him while he's down and push him off the ledge. 

This is definitely a case of most of new fanbase really believing the book will be out ""in a few months"" and that book 7 will be ""soon after"" and ""the last book"" and the older fanbase finally coming to grips with the fact that this series is getting finished on television and never in print, unless GRRM changes his mind about letting someone else finish.  

Book 6 isn't going to be out soon. Book 7 will take six to eight years to write also. And the obviously necessary Book 8 would take 5 years if George was miraculously still healthy. 

But hey, if GRRM feeling propped up by the fans keeps him from getting depressed and makes him churn books out  ~~faster~~ less slowly, then sure ""No problems, George, take your time.""

Sometimes parents give cookies to their whining children to shut them up too. Its not good parenting, but sometimes its what they need for their own sanity."
The Deadline,"Eh, it's not exactly ""don't sweat it, George"" - people's expectations are super low so its more along the lines of ""what a surprise...wake me up next year when he says the same stuff again"""
The Deadline,"Hopefully he doesn't visit Reddit.  There are a bunch of people here saying he's lazy, fat, has stopped caring about the series, has one foot in the grave, and other nonsense like that.

And these are comments from people who self-identify as his fans.  I'd hate to see what they'd write about people they hate."
The Deadline,[This](http://grrm.livejournal.com/465247.html) is the announcement for anyone that missed it.
The Deadline,"Well, I'm disappointed because there are writers out there who treat it like an actual job versus an art. He could finish it if he actually sat down and wrote 8 hours a day, like a job. I don't think he's obligated to suddenly decide writing is a job instead of an art - but I'm disappointed that he doesn't feel that way. Sanderson totally feels that writing is a job and he blasts through books and I think the quality is still excellent."
The Deadline,"I think people were saying ""don't sweat it, George"" because they knew the book would be delayed (and it will probably be delayed again). Add into the fact that even some diehard fans of the novels have more interest in future seasons of the TV show than reading the new novels and it's more apathy and a lack of an expectation than anything, really."
The Deadline,"I'm hopping on the ""he doesn't give a shit anymore"" bandwagon. 4 and 5 were pretty shit compared to 1, 2, and 3. "
The Deadline,"Kinda sucks but I'm not at all surprised. I'm thinking TWOW comes out in late 2016, and ADOS remains a dream."
The Deadline,Probably because he's liable to have a heart attack if we give him too much abuse. We need to keep him as unstressed as possible.
The Deadline,"It's pretty disappointing Grrm missed his deadlime again but he doesn't need any hate. He probably feels worse about it than even the biggest superfan. While they lose hearing about what happens in their favorite book series he loses his legacy or at least a big chunk of it.

Feast Dance had a lot of problems. Likely TWOW if it's ever released will have them too. It's from this that I draw that GRRM has lost control of his story. He made it bigger than he could handle and doesn't know how to underail the train. Poor guy.

As for me even though I used to be a big fan I'm at the point where I don't really care anymore. I didn't like the last two seasons of the show, nor did I find the last two books that engaging especially compared to where asos left off. I don't find D&D to be good writers and how they've handled a lot characters, development, and many other things isn't what I like to see in a television show. With one of the few characters I still really liked being character assassinated and then dying unceremoniously I don't think the show is for me either. Other than occasionally playing crusader kings I think Westeros is something I no longer care about. 

GRRM I hope your legacy isnt fully ruined."
The Deadline,All the other fans are probably too exasperated to comment.
The Deadline,"So Long, and Thanks for the Show.

PS: I've read the books and watched the show. The last book was a disaster and desperately needed  harsh editing. Said story was supposed to be wrapped up in 3 books but now with the amount of open plot threads and the amount of story to tread, it seems even 7 wouldn't be enough. I would be quite happy to watch the abridged version being resolved in the show and unfortunately believe the poor unhealthy 67 year old GRRM would croak before he completes the series. And he's said all his notes and works are going to be burned upon his death, so its not like some poor sod can pick up his notes and cobble together and ending. A betting man would look for solace in the show."
The Deadline,"And then GRRM logged onto reddit and his ""astonishment"" turned to ""pure rage."""
The Deadline,"I think he's cherry-picking comments to suit his own mindset, I would be shocked if the majority of readers were fine with the constant delays.

I also fear my enjoyment of the books will be hampered by now comparing it to events depicted in the show.  I would be constantly questioning whether or not something that was written was influenced by what happened in the show instead of being a natural progression of what Martin wanted to create.  For me the show has completely gone off the rails as it tries to fill in its own blanks and creating its own character beats that don't gel with how they were written.

With all that said, I do appreciate that he may be suffering from ASoIaF fatigue having been at it for 20 years or more."
The Deadline,I need to see less astonishing and more writing. 
The Deadline,"The fans returned after he continually blew self-announced deadlines on A Dance of Dragons instead of walking away. After Game of Thrones exploded his publishers lost all leverage over him. The show passing the books, and confirming/spoiling things like R + L = J, was the last ""stick"" that could have been used to motivate him. 

I think there are two possibilities now based upon his ""woe is me, I don't like deadlines"" post. The first is now that all the pressure is off he'll be able to return to writing without worry and be able to bang out the remainder of the book relatively quickly. The second is that he's now fully enabled to keep procrastinating and the book will never come out. "
The Deadline,"That's just fine with me, I'm tired of people ditching on GoT episodes because it was different than the books. "
The Deadline,I have been mad at him for so many years I have really just given up.  Please just finish!    
The Deadline,Truly amazing how many deadlines his publishers allow him to miss. Any other author would not get the same treatment. 
The Deadline,"Saying ""Don't sweat it, George"" is just enabling the man. Everyone -- be they writer or garbage man -- must hew to professional deadlines and quotas at some point. GRRM is being given massive leeway because of his celebrity/cult status to an almost infantilizing degree. Buckle down and get it done.    "
The Deadline,"I'm not upset at all about any of this, even though I both watch the show and have read (multiple times) the books. There's a lot of reasons why.

**The books aren't the show, and the show isn't the books** 
The show is obviously not a literal interpretation of the events laid out in the books. I think of it like a parallel universe where the essence of the characters are pretty intact, they're just faced with different plot twists and choices. I think the same will be true once the show outpaces the books.

**ADWD really just wasn't that good**
Loved it for furthering the story, but usually skip it if I re-read anything because it's just so meanderingly long and frustrating. Kind of thinking the whole endeavor is just not the same for GRRM anymore, for whatever reasons, and it has affected his writing. I'm not sure how dedicated he feels to completing the story so much as obligated, and that sounds like a pretty soul-crushing place to be for someone that doesn't do well under deadlines and similar pressure. It might be okay that his work peters out and someone else takes over, like Sanderson did with WoT.

**I'm just thankful he made Westeros in the first place**
Seriously. No matter what happens, I'm just stoked that fantasy on this level is widely embraced and given a spotlight. The story and world are awesome. I think we're all better off for having it around to talk about and enjoy.

TL;DR GRRM doesn't owe me shit, and that's okay.
"
The Deadline,"""Don't sweat it, George, because the show has gotten better than the books anyway."""
The Deadline,"I think most of us, like me personally, were really upset about this when we realized it months ago.  By now, I've accepted it and am over it.  "
The Deadline,"I think it's been great that ASOIAF fans are starting to come around to Neil Gaiman's point of view: '[George R.R. Martin is not your bitch](http://journal.neilgaiman.com/2009/05/entitlement-issues.html)'

> People are not machines. Writers and artists aren't machines.

>You're complaining about George doing other things than writing the books you want to read as if your buying the first book in the series was a contract with him: that you would pay over your ten dollars, and George for his part would spend every waking hour until the series was done, writing the rest of the books for you.

>No such contract existed. You were paying your ten dollars for the book you were reading, and I assume that you enjoyed it because you want to know what happens next.

>It seems to me that the biggest problem with series books is that either readers complain that the books used to be good but that somewhere in the effort to get out a book every year the quality has fallen off, or they complain that the books, although maintaining quality, aren't coming out on time.

Considering how entitled and bent out of shape 'fandom' usually gets from behind anonymous accounts I think this is pretty refreshing to see."
The Deadline,"It seems like he just hears the good things about himself and the series and doesn't take any of the criticism to heart. Even tho sometimes it is needed. ""Oh people are saying my last 2 books were subpar, ah they don't know theykle buy the next ones anyways I'm way to famous to have to deal with an editor or anyone correcting me for the sake of better work."" "
The Deadline,"Do you think they'll do some sort of spin-off series (sorta like the Telltales game, but not shitty) after the sixth season? Perhaps they would continue filming the main series but not release it for a while."
The Deadline,There will always be that Kathy Bates Misery type fan who will abduct him and force him to finish his sixth book. 
The Deadline,I wonder how many loyal fans will wait for the book before watching the new season? I think it is actually better to watch first and read second. So I'm cool with waiting. 
The Deadline,He can't have been looking too hard cus all I've seen is people massively slagging him off.
The Deadline,"It could delay the TV shows seventh season, depending on how far season 6 goes through the unfinished book.

I doubt HBO will want to completely be off book for any amount of time, this delay could possibly kill the show or delay it pretty badly.

This is coming from someone who could not get into the show, so i have no stake in it either way, just a thought I had."
The Deadline,When it comes to literature it's almost always preferable the author take their time and make it as good as can be rather than just rush any old trash out. 
The Deadline,Don't sweat it? Seriously? Get to writing you fat bastard!
The Deadline,He should get an Adderall prescription. 
The Deadline,"I think the fans meant ""please stop sweating"", cause he's quite obese. "
The Deadline,"Ah screw it, I'll just say what I feel - GET BACK TO WORK GEORGE! I have been waiting for years already! "
The Deadline,"This starts reminding me of The Wheel of Time of Robert Jordan, the author died in 2007 and the last two books got written/finished by Brandon Sanderson and though he tried the writing style was so different I hated them :(. I hope George manages to finish the Game of Thrones books, he is old after all."
The Deadline,I don't think I'll ever start reading this series because I wouldn't want to be disappointed with an incomplete story. I'll just continue watching the TV show which I enjoy thoroughly.
The Deadline,"This reminds me so much of Steven Kings Dark Tower series.  I really started to believe it never would get finished, and at some points felt that the story was a chaotic mess.  But after nearly thirty years it was done."
Great Men Academy,Steve Blackman?! The nunchucks guy?
Great Men Academy,How is season three?
Great Men Academy,Season 4 should just be Allison being slapped in the face every 30 seconds.  What a miserable character turn
Great Men Academy,"Blackman:
>“I think inevitably if we got a Season 4, it’s going towards an endgame. I think at a certain point, I’m not sure where we’d go after Season 4. We have to be careful. My plan for next year is not to continually tread on the same ground we have before. It’s a challenge to come up with a new way to subvert this storyline, and I think we have an idea how to do that. But I think if we got to Season 4, it would be a great ending for the run of the show. I’m not saying I couldn’t do more, but you know, I think that would be very satisfying for the audience, four seasons.”"
Great Men Academy,"Make a show about Klaus and 5. And kill the rest, especially Allison."
Great Men Academy,"I think it's fantastic shows planning for a reasonable ending to their story.  I have largely stopped watching new shows b cause of cancel happy networks


Yes I am still fucking bitter about firefly, why do you ask?"
Great Men Academy,"Seems like a mixed review season. I binged all 3 seasons over the last week and actually really enjoyed the entire thing, start to finish. The first two seasons were great, but both had a similar feel. The world ends in a few days, so we have to stop it. Season 3 I actually enjoyed the most. It kept the similar “save the world” aspect, but it felt more contained than the other seasons, which allowed for a lot of character interactions. 

The one (or two I guess) gripes I have about season 3 are Allison and >!New Ben!<. Allison really sucked this season and >!Ben!< didn’t stop whining literally the entire time. Looking forward to season 4 although >!idk how it’ll be if the main cast doesn’t have their powers for a portion of it.!<"
Great Men Academy,Hope it gets a fourth season. Wasn't wild about S1 but S2 was a marked improvement and S3 was really good as well.
Great Men Academy,"This show and Doom Patrol lost me by disappearing up its own ass. The sorrows and goals of the characters are completely unrelatable to me. If every single of the ""heroes"" were to die in the next ep I'd be like ""Lol! Where is *this* going??""."
Great Men Academy,"S1 and S2 were great, S3 not so much"
Great Men Academy,Loved this current season. Finished it in under 24 hours. Please one more season at least!
Great Men Academy,season 4 aka what world-ending event will vanya/viktor cause this time?
Great Men Academy,I hope 🤞 s04
Great Men Academy,Season 3 was no where as good as the first two.
Great Men Academy,"Umbrella was never my favorite show, but I was plenty entertained by the second season. However, from third season I got though 2 episodes and I was done. 

I get that some of the characters are supposed to be dumb to begin with, but holy shit. Not much of what people did made any sense, after they knew their situation. Actually, even before that, with the whole starting situation at the house."
Great Men Academy,Absolutely loving season 3
Great Men Academy,I hope so see the 4th and final season of UA as well because S3 left a sour taste with it's writing.
Great Men Academy,"Ooof. I found this season to be a chore.

And what was with their fact checking? Let's name our black hole a kugelblitz, cause who knows what that word really means right? There were other instances where they named things that a quick Google search would show they used the name wrong. 

But the last 4 episodes were of their last hour before the end of the UNIVERSE. Tick tock writers, move it along already."
Great Men Academy,[deleted]
Great Men Academy,"I’m not really remembering that much from the previous series. 

I’m just expecting another season of Doom Patrol. 

All of these shows are merging into one."
Great Men Academy,Reading the writing on the wall that Netflix is only interested in programming that’s cheap to make now.
Great Men Academy,Season 2 was meh. Season 3 really sucked. Please no season 4. Put this show out of its misery.
Great Men Academy,That dude can be a great x-men cyclops
Great Men Academy,"Better be, the new season was shit"
Great Men Academy,"What I don't get about supe series in general, they never do crime fighting. Like that supes 101."
Great Men Academy,The ending of season 4 was absolutely terrible huge build up in the season for nothing what a disappointment.
Great Men Academy,Yes please! I hate the crew on this show so much and I would really like to not have to deal with that collection of humans ever again.
Great Men Academy,[https://c.tenor.com/colOq6ccvS4AAAAC/steve-blackman-glowstick-nunchucks.gif](https://c.tenor.com/colOq6ccvS4AAAAC/steve-blackman-glowstick-nunchucks.gif)
Great Men Academy,I have been making this joke to my friends since the show started but none of them grew up watching wrestling. Seeing this comment NOT in the Squared Circle subreddit vindicates me.
Great Men Academy,That's what I was thinking for a sec.
Great Men Academy,The Lethal Weapon
Great Men Academy,[This bit still cracks me up](https://v.redd.it/1pa0xrig8wv81)
Great Men Academy,The production quality seems to have gone down a lot. It makes it almost feel like a completely different show. I haven’t really enjoyed most of what I have seen after watching the first couple of episodes. I’ll probably finish it since I have watched it up to now but it will be on the lower end of shows I want to watch.
Great Men Academy,"On the opposite end of the other reply I would argue that it is the worst season. I personally didn’t like it at all, a lot of the scenes seemed somewhat disjointed in tone and some of the acting was downright terrible. In saying that I loved pretty much every scene Klaus was in."
Great Men Academy,im watching it and its kind of bad
Great Men Academy,"I thought season 3 was pretty awful. This show was always quirkiness and style over writing, but man, season 3 was rough.

I feel like something happened with the production. The CG looked shockingly bad for a modern day popular show, like CW superhero show bad, but the first two seasons didn’t look like that. Tons of stuff didn’t make sense: logic, conversations, motivations, plans, etc. Even the acting seemed off from the first two seasons, almost everyone was hamming it up more than usual.

Not really sure what went down. Other Netflix shows that were presumably being made around the same (Covid) seemed fine. Cobra Kai, Stranger Things, etc."
Great Men Academy,"It's somewhat good but it suffers from the same frustrations of the previous seasons where the Umbrella Academy split up, never communicate vital information and then come back together in the final few episodes.

Klaus once again was great you can tell the actor is having fun with the role. 

Five took a bit of a backseat this season and felt kinda under utilized. 

Elliot Page transition was handled really sweetly in the show and didn't feel preachy or out of place. It actually blends well with the events of the previous season.

The Sparrows are kinda under utilized in the season which is a real shame, they were great with what we saw of them.

Won't say anymore as I don't want to spoil it but it's not a bad season but is a bit weaker than the previous one. They rely on too many of the same tropes which can feel repetitive."
Great Men Academy,"It looks much worse than previous seasons. It features extensive green screen/Stagecraft work, which makes it look awful.

I didn't find the story to be compelling or coherent."
Great Men Academy,"It was really good. Granted - there were some plot threads that were slightly disjointed, but if you've watched the other 2 seasons it's nothing too crazy. Other than that, it was honestly really good. No spoilers, but you get some fun interactions (Klaus & someone) that you really wouldn't expect, it was great."
Great Men Academy,"its watchable if you follow the show since ss1, not as good as ss2 but overall i still enjoyed it"
Great Men Academy,I thought it was the best by far. I started watching it as a background to a game I was playing on my iPad and ended up focusing more on the show.
Great Men Academy,"It is good, I liked it atleast. Though after reaching the end it seemed more like a prologue, setting things up for the next adventure. But I think a lot of characters got personal development.

There are fewer full scale fight scenes than previous seasons. But I personally likes that it was more character centric. And od course the soundtrack is amazing as always."
Great Men Academy,"It's not the worst, but not the best either. The handling of character dynamics went out the window. The plot is yet another save the world from the apocalypse thing."
Great Men Academy,"It's good. That's all lol. It's good. It's okay. Season 2 is where it's at still, then season 1. Personally I'm mildly disappointed but it could be sooo much worse!!"
Great Men Academy,As soon as she sexually assaulted Luther which likely would have lead to her raping him there was no going back for her character. She is no longer redeemable to me and it annoys me the writers tried to redeem her for the rest of the season. It makes me wonder if we're supposed to have forgiven her by the end of this season like Victor did by trusting her.
Great Men Academy,"I was more pissed with 5's reaction. It's easy to see that Alison perception is 100% skewed because she is breaking apart. At that point I didn't expect better from her. 

5 just seemed to randomly put his foot down despite that every member of the academy has consistently acted almost entirely out of self interest with little or no regard to the team or there plans. Hell 5 himself had just gotten back from his own little mission that he did behind the teams back."
Great Men Academy,"Okay am I the only one who thought it was already pretty much confirmed that Alison had pulled similar fucked up stuff with her first husband, Patrick?

""*I heard a rumour that you loved me.*""

I hate that she leans into the truely reprehensible aspects of her power against those she claims to care about when she isn't getting her way, but I'm a bit confused why so many people are shocked she rumored Luther to kiss her. While Alison is mostly one of the nicer of the Hargreaves children, she, in my opinion, is also one of the darker ones as well because manipulating people is basically second nature to her."
Great Men Academy,Allison was pissing me off this season.
Great Men Academy,"She literally sexually assaulted Luther by forcing him to kiss her, what the actual fuck. She was so interesting and cool in seasons 1 and 2."
Great Men Academy,Worst part of the season.
Great Men Academy,Seriously. and to think that now she will be the only one still with powers pisses me off. I hated how some things were written this season. it felt like flushing any previous character developments down the drain
Great Men Academy,"I fully understand her character turn and thought it made a lot of sense. She has been waiting for 2 years to see her child. She left her husband, who she was completely in love with, to be with her daughter… then she found out that Claire didn’t exist. 
I don’t know how I would react, but I know I would breakdown. 
I’m certainly not condoning her actions but they make sense."
Great Men Academy,This is why u dont have children fucking loosing them makes people absolutely wack
Great Men Academy,"> Season 4 should just be Allison being slapped in the face every 30 seconds. What a miserable character turn

Honestly I wanted to slap all of them every 30 seconds for various reasons"
Great Men Academy,If they giver her powers that she has in the comics…. She’ll get her redemption in season 4
Great Men Academy,She’s used to getting what she wants but also won’t rumor her own family after getting burned for rumoring her own daughter
Great Men Academy,[removed]
Great Men Academy,Yea Allison's entire S3 story line was annoying and forced. I'd be thrilled if she didn't come back for s4 or if we got an older version of her or something.
Great Men Academy,I really grew to love those 2 characters as well. I would love to see more.
Great Men Academy,"The early 2000s Fox had put out a bunch of shows that I absolutely fell in love with and then never even gave a chance to. Kept moving them around and was like ""Well gee there's just no audience for it and we have no clue why."" I just stopped giving any of their shows a chance after a point."
Great Men Academy,"It was 20 fucking years ago. Can we please stop with this bizarre reverence for a 1-season show from 20 fucking years ago? The fact it got a movie was bonkers to me, personally. There are so many other better sci-fi TV shows and yet people are still circle-jerking over a show that got such terrible ratings when it was on that it was cancelled before the end of its first season and just barely made its money back on the movie. It wasn't even that good of a show. Like it was cute and memeable, I'll give it that, but it was nowhere near the ridiculous god-tier that nerd culture has assigned it. Let. It. Go."
Great Men Academy,"My coworker was telling me about this show she heard about staring ""that guy from The Rookie"". I had zero clue who, or what show she was talking about. So she looked it up and she said ""oh, Serenity! and the show that goes with it?""

It was like a knife in the heart. I couldn't tell her the sad truth. More people need to feel the pain. Maybe, just maybe we'll get another season."
Great Men Academy,Firefly was good but it also never had the chance to be bad. Look at Westworld.
Great Men Academy,This is why I started watching Korean dramas. Most of them end after one season.
Great Men Academy,"I was going to say that as well. The first two seasons I found ok, the third season had me hooked."
Great Men Academy,They did
Great Men Academy,"Season 2 was a slog. I really don't like how the show focuses on Vanya/Victor so much... but yes Allison was right Victor causing the apocalypse seems to be a reoccurring theme.

But I'm finally glad that \*spoilers\* Luther finally got over Allison this season \*spoilers\*"
Great Men Academy,"S2 is easily the worst of the three as it only got good with the last 2 episodes. S3 was inherently better than S1 as S1 was clearly made to be a weekly show with its cliffhangers every episode but being a Netflix show, bingeing hurts the experience. At least things are written better in S3 but the stylist part of the show took a huge hit."
Great Men Academy,"It wasn't the last hour. First off, they sealed it in that cube for awhile, then a lot of it was local, the nearby area was destroyed but they moved location. Then they went into the mirror hotel universe and there is no reason to think time was passing at all there. And the universe was already destroyed by that point."
Great Men Academy,Maybe it’s just you.
Great Men Academy,"The showrunner doesn't have to worry about what Netflix wants, there's no reason to believe it's not his decision except for cynicism"
Great Men Academy,Which certainly explains Stranger Things./s
Great Men Academy,Just look at the writing credits for each ep and you can tell why its gone to hell (steve blackman)
Great Men Academy,This is what Mac thinks he looks like
Great Men Academy,"Same thing here. I'll be like ""The Lethal Weapon did great on this season"" and they are like ""what?"" and I remember no one I know has any idea who the other Steve Blackman is. At least on iZombie everyone knew who the other Rob Thomas was."
Great Men Academy,There are dozens of us!
Great Men Academy,"I think it's worth finishing, but agreed. There's a reference to ""assassins that wear cartoon masks"" in the final episode and I had to remind myself ""oh yeah this is the same show"".

My major complaints aren't the acting or CGI, just the inconsistent writing quality. Sometimes it's good, sometimes it's cw tier, and sometimes a character sexually assaults another and it's never brought up again.


The plot itself is interesting as always, and I like the actors. But the writers really have no clue what they're doing and Steve Blackman saying ""I want the show to go to 7 seasons of possible"" does not inspire confidence considering they've already caught up to the comics."
Great Men Academy,That makes sense. Just watching the first two episodes made me realize how much I watch it more as a chore than other shows.
Great Men Academy,"For me, the character judgement was baffling. The whole vote thing at the end... why? What is the point of voting no? >!Particularly for the Luther, and the girl he had just married... ""We'd like to spend an hour here alone and die, rather than try and save the universe so we can live out the rest of our lives happily""!<. It genuinely made absolutely no sense. And of course, the acting was absolutely terrible at times. Basically sounded like the actors were just reading the script off a board behind the camera."
Great Men Academy,"Damn that’s sad to hear, but not surprising about Klaus, he is the best one"
Great Men Academy,"My wife and I binged both season 1 and 2 and this 3rd season has been a drag so far for us. 

Don't think it helps we're actively watching The Boys and the gap in quality is immense.

3 episodes in and feeling like it's a chore to watch, does it get better?"
Great Men Academy,I thought the first couple episodes were good but the pacing/editing on the final 3 was just bad
Great Men Academy,[deleted]
Great Men Academy,"I stopped a few minutes into the second episode. I’m still gonna watch it eventually, but I was not really enjoying it."
Great Men Academy,It was shot during the height of the pandemic and lock downs.
Great Men Academy,"> (Klaus & someone)

Klaus & *anyone*.

Klaus is a goddamned delight every moment he’s onscreen. Seriously, I want Robert Sheehan to be in everything, I don’t know that I’ve ever seen a performance by him that he didn’t knock out of the park - loved him since Misfits."
Great Men Academy,I’m gonna start it now but it will probably take a few weeks to finish it. There is just so much I’m watching right now.
Great Men Academy,"“Best by far”

“Was watching it on the background “

Lmao what? I think that speaks about the quality of it then"
Great Men Academy,a background?! that's curious.
Great Men Academy,">I started watching it as a background to a game

well that explains why you think like that. because to me this season felt like they ignored most of what the characters went through in the past 2 seasons. and the worse part is that you have to wait for the next season because it had no pay off"
Great Men Academy,"I felt very strange about the writing. Allison assaulted Luther, murdered Harlan, and was a complete asshole to Viktor, blaming him for damn near every bad thing in existence, and everyone kind of just didn’t seem to care that much about her behavior. She crossed several lines, and it didn’t feel like there was enough fallout. I don’t know what the writers intended me to feel about it."
Great Men Academy,"Yeah, when he was lecturing Viktor about the definition of a villain, I was like “Excuse me? All of you fuckers constantly run off and do dumb, dangerous shit on your own.”"
Great Men Academy,I think it’s more the culmination of everything.  She has always been kind of awful.  She controls Viktor for the majority of her life.   She does it to her first husband.   She does it to get famous.   It was countered by her being one of the nicer of the bunch though.  This season there was no redeeming counterbalance and I think the last few scenes were designed more to be redeeming arc stuff which just wasn’t earned.  The last scene of the city clearly puts Hargreaves as the one to still overcome so Unless they go hard on Alison being a villain in the 4th season it really fell flat for me.
Great Men Academy,"I get the feeling she is just an hypocrite, she is nice and supportive when things are easy or she is getting something in return… if things are not in her interests she just snaps"
Great Men Academy,She’s used to getting what she wants but also won’t rumor her own family after getting burned for rumoring her own daughter
Great Men Academy,Her character has been doing things like that her entire life. She used her powers to become a movie star and get with any man she wanted.
Great Men Academy,[deleted]
Great Men Academy,Easily. I really enjoyed the season overall but this was just frustrating as hell.
Great Men Academy,I wonder if there is anyway she will “rumour” the others to have powers again?
Great Men Academy,"So losing a child makes rape ok? Also, she’d been raping her first husband throughout their marriage, so clearly it has nothing to do with the kid. Allison is just evil"
Away,"Neeson:

>”No, I’m not,” Neeson said when asked if he’s interested in returning. “There’s so many spinoffs of ‘Star Wars.’ It’s diluting it to me, and it’s taken away the mystery and the magic in a weird way.”

>""It was nice to do that little bit with Ewan, after 25 years, 24 years. I appeared in the last episode. I had 2 lines to say, and it was cool and I loved it. But that's it."""
Away,Star Wars is being hurt by lack of direction and mediocrity.
Away,"The only Star Wars spinoff I've liked is Rogue One and Andor. 

Andor was one of those where I couldn't *believe* anyone was able to get the script approved."
Away,"I just don't understand why they insist only doing stuff from the start of the clone wars to just after the fall of the empire. Give me some Old Republic stuff like Mandalorian wars, the ancient sith lords, or the creation of the jedi order."
Away,Or maybe it's that the ratio of good to shitty movies/shows is like 1 out of 5 being generous.
Away,Number of spin-offs isn't the problem. Terrible scripts are.
Away,Liam Neesons though….
Away,"Honestly, the last movies were hideous in comparison with the spin offs."
Away,They are being hurt from shit stories and terrible writers
Away,There's different camps of Star Wars fans. Original trilogy vs original 6 vs disney Star Wars
Away,"ITT: Lots of misdirected anger.

The guy is right, and there's nothing wrong with him saying so.

Edit: FYI, if you're writing me a five paragraph essay of fan drivel, I'm not going to read it."
Away,"I can see where he's coming from, but when your spinoffs (Mando, Andor) are considered better than the trilogy that recently came out, you gotta get behind what's still making you bank."
Away,"He then closed out the interview by promoting his next film.

#Tooken 8: The Tookening"
Away,"He's not wrong.

It's why DC Comics tried to streamline things for new readers with The New 52, and then Marvel later tried the same thing with Marvel NOW!; when there's too much of something, people get fatigued trying to keep up with everything.

You could always say ""don't watch everything"" but that's not how the brain works."
Away,The “mystery” was taken away with “midiclorians “
Away,"Agreed. And he isn't saying all ""spinoffs"" are bad, which would be unsupportable (see: Andor). An overabundance of varying quality, definitely."
Away,"Wasn't he in the midichlorians Star Wars episode that literally removed the mystery of the force?

And didn't he have that bullshit story line about Anakin?  Ok, just checking."
Away,I agree with him for the most part. Andor was out of this world.
Away,"I mean I kinda agree 

Mainly if your content isn’t AAA maybe it shouldn’t be made 

Like bad batch is great but some episodes are kinda filler and think obi wan and boba Fett shows don’t need to exist"
Away,He should know. He was a part of the beginning of the end.
Away,He's right.
Away,Andor
Away,"Andor was ten times better than the last 6 movies.

I think it's the opposite.  The terrible movies are ruining the franchise.

Even bobba fett was better than the last few movies."
Away,"I hate to break it to him, but the prequels diminished the value of the franchise."
Away,"Says the guy from: Men in Black International, Daddy’s Home 2, The Huntsman, Ted 2, Taken 1-2-3, Anchorman 2, Wrath of the Titans, The Chronicles of Narnia, The A-Team, Les Mis, Arthur the King, Excalibur, and I’m sure I’m missing a few spinoffs, remakes and sequels. He is well versed in running stories into the ground."
Away,Says the man in the first spinoff.
Away,Bro there’s too many Liam Neeson movies if anything. Three of them came out last year alone and I bet they were all basically the same
Away,"He's right. I used to really enjoy the movies occasionally. Even saw the prequels in theaters. Then they kept coming, one after the other and every dumb mother fucker in the world is out here trying to act like they are the biggest fan in the world. It got so annoying that I can't enjoy any of that shit anymore"
Away,It’s become the Empire
Away,I don’t mind the expanded universe of movies so long as they are not shit and lately the complaint is that the movies and spinoffs have been nothing but social justice shit.
Away,Totally agree
Away,"Yeah, sorry Liam, but nah. Projects like Rogue One, Mandalorian, Bad Batch, and Andor show that there is plenty of time for great stories in this universe. It's not an issue of to much content, but an issue of flying space Mary Poppins cameos of Princess Leia's reanimated corpse and Jar Jar Bigalow ""Mee-sa Senator now"" being regurgitated into the screen. The issue isn't volume, it's quality."
Away,"""Being hurt""?  


No, the damage was done a very long time ago. Now its more like kicking the pulverized remains of a long dead horse"
Away,"Hes right, but also....

Do another movie where your a grizzled old veteran that has to begrudgingly do one last job or save someone that's in trouble, and in the process you redeem yourself."
Away,Says the guy who did “Taken” and dozen other  of the same formulaic films of a guy seeking revenge.
Away,"“Star Wars” always struck me as a story about Anakin Skywalker and how he turned away from good and then was redeemed by the love of his son. 

That story has been told."
Away,"Stars Wars succumbed to the Marvel-ization effect a while ago. I feel the same way about a new star wars IP as I do a new superhero movie: oh, ok."
Away,I happen to agree with Mr Neeson on this...
Away,Whatever made Andor happen - keep doing that.  Best Star Wars material out there.
Away,"people here complaining about diluting star wars, sayin disney is at fault.

meanwhile i was reading these same stories in the 90s, in comic and/or novel form, because the star wars EU existed.

the only difference is now they are turning the stories into live action. hell episode 9, which i greatly dislike, is still very much Dark Empire from the 90s.

Fuck if they dont need to go ahead and make Shadows of the Empire into a live action series.

crime lords vs sith lords. lets go!"
Away,"Well Star Wars fans have proven that they'll watch and like any old crap, so it doesn't really matter."
Away,I agree and also like the some of the spin offs.
Away,Space Jesus isn't wrong
Away,"Think the sequel trilogy did that, mate."
Away,When does Taken 6 come out?
Away,I think it’s diluting for me that Neeson has made multiple films with the same plot for the last 15 years.
Away,Clearly not a fan of Andor being better than his entire role.
Away,"No, it's been hurt by Disney having ZERO outline for the Sequel Trilogy.  Rian Johnson's Episode 8 was a mess, then Episode 9 was an abomination.  ""Somehow, Palpatine returned.""  

Say what you will about Geroge Lucas' writing skills, but ""Somehow, Palpatine returned.""  Is just about the most idiotic sentence in any Star Wars movie... scratch that, ANY movie where a villain came back for unexplained reasons."
Away,Boooo … explore the Galaxy.
Away,"Yeah, well, you know, that's just, like, your opinion, man.

I think its fine, its more the varying quality that is the problem, not the quantity."
Away,"I have to disagree with him - especially when it comes to the shows.  For this IP or any other, it really comes down to the quality of what is being produced, not the number.  If it is good, then people will watch it.  For ***Star Wars*** specifically, the ""universe"" is so large I am enjoying the more micro looks into it."
Away,"Ehh sounds like an old man complaining bout kids on the lawn, I wanna see every story of that universe and now I can. Sure some are misses but at least they tried."
Away,Jar Jar.
Away,"I don't know, many people are actually liking some of the things they have done. Many spinoffs in the movie department were really good, like rogue one and solo, many were great successes like the mandalorian and andor. Fans love those (maybe some not so much at the start like it happened with the episodes one though three) but the misses on Disney plus have been much less, the bigger ones were in the last trilogy.

The only thing that really was going to hurt the brand was focusing entirely on the Skywalkers. Fans loved and live through the extended universe for years until they had some live action stuff again. And that was the beauty of Starwars how they could make different stories in the same universe not make everything about the same people all the time."
Away,It is funny because the spinoffs are the only thing that I enjoy.
Away,Yeah it started around 2001...
Away,"You were in one of those spinoffs, Liam! XD"
Away,"Yep star wars stopped being special a long time ago but there was money to be made so can't really blame disney for squeezing every penny out of it. If you could of told 12 year old me there would be multiple star wars tv shows and movies I would never be even quasi interested in, I don't think I would of believed you, but here we are."
Away,I mean...the movie he was in started that.
Away,"Hard to agree when Andor is hands down the best piece of starwars content out there.

I know people who don't watch any starwars content that loved Andor."
Away,"Yes, but I knew Disney was going to get that 4 billion they paid George Lucas for the franchise back and then some.

There was a video of a guy or someone freaking out when Star Wars Episode 49 or some such came out. I figured that was where it was going to go."
Away,Pretty sure midiclorines s/p are the ones that took the mystery away.
Away,I love Qui-Gon!
Away,"Lol. jar jar binks. There are only 3 star wars films, anything else ruins it."
Away,Wrong
Away,Wrong.
Away,"After reading the comments, I just wanted to say I enjoy the prequels; especially ROTS!"
Away,Honestly… Rogue One is the only Star Wars movie I like and would watch again.
Away,Oh please bring back the midiclorian bs…
Away,Humbly disagree.
Away,"I love Liam, but Star Wars shat that bed the first movie he was in. At first i was annoyed at them ruining my childhood. Then I realized I'm a grown ass man. Maybe it's ok that Star Wars don't cater to me as a grown ass man the way they did when I was a kid."
Away,Yep.  This cow has been milked dry
Away,"From the man, in the movie that gave us a boring genetic reason for jedi to exist."
Away,"No, because there was no more story to tell after the first trilogy."
Away,The damage was done with the prequels.
Away,"Yeah, fuck that. Andor was great. Rogue One was great. Keep them coming."
Away,No one tell him about where midichlorians came from
Away,"I feel like the original appeal was a rag tag group of filmmakers and actors got together to tell a story about a rag tag group of underdogs adventuring around space, with lots of space battles and laser swords. But it's grown so beyond that now that it's so exceptionally mainstream. That's probably why The Mandalorian and The Clone Wars are so popular among fans because they are the closest to capturing that spirit."
Away,"I love The Mandalorian and the original trilogy. I haven't seen Clone Wars or Andor yet. Otherwise, I think the franchise has been more misses than hits."
Away,"I think he has a point. Lot of garbage in the star wars universe. But there's some true gems. Andor is truly remarkable and if you love star wars, then this series acts as a love letter without unnecessary fan service. It's fantastic story telling within the star wars universe with compelling and interesting characters."
Away,That’s because he didn’t get a part in a good show. Like Andor…
Away,I swear I read this as Leslie Nielsen.
Away,“We have to explain the reason behind Han Solo’s last name.”
Away,"…He says from the set of Taken 13. /s 

But for real, they should’ve stopped after the prequels, at least there was a point to those ones."
Away,Isn't this one of the main criticisms leveled against the prequels when they came out? George Lucas has the same problem I do where he has too much anxiety when it comes to explaining things and so he over explains instead of letting the audience infer things. A big reason the first 3 movies were good was because of his ex-wife who edited them.
Away,-said a person who's never read a star wars book
Away,No its being hurt by idiots making the decisions and poor writing
Away,"If only Qui Gon had a young daughter that had been kidnapped whilst on holiday in Coruscant with her best friend, and then he had to use his talents to track her and bring justice to the evil ringleader of the trafficking gang. That would have worked as a spinoff series!!!"
Away,You mean bad star wars. Andor is a masterclass in how NOT to fuck up the universe. I say more spinoffs
Away,"True, I literally did not even care about the spin-offs only the main trilogy movies."
Away,"I totally disagree with Neeson here. If they made fewer Star Wars spinoffs they wouldn't suddenly be more magical. Instead of regular soulless cash crabs it would just be somewhat rare soulless cash crabs.

Hack writers and creatively bankrupt people don't magically become more talented by doing less work."
Away,"That's a very reductive take on what is a grand fictional universe ripe to tell many different kinds of stories in.

Lack of mystery and magic doesn't happen because of spin-offs, it happens because of unimaginative writers.

But there is a bit of truth to it, of course. You can't keep telling stories without chipping away at the mysteries of the IP. That's just how it goes.

However, I have never believed that to mean that more stories shouldn't be told."
Away,I've got the perfect solution: don't watch the spinoffs.
Away,He’s right and he should say it.
Away,"Well, I don't know. Maybe he has a point, but for me the reason it has been hurt has more to do with the lack of talent and vision, particularly in the sequel trilogy."
Away,10000% agreed
Away,Solo is the best Star Wars movie and I'll die on that hill.
Away,"Star Wars and the the MCU stuff too. Disney is milking she shit out of it, and that's what we now tend to get, shit.
This also goes for a lot of Neesons movies now. The old guy action hero has really hit a spot in the last year's where it's just getting ridiculous and bad. He has done some many of them and all where basicly Taken but with less and less appeal."
Away,Disney crashed the franchise with no survivors.
Away,Maybe bringing balance to “the force” ultimately is making it a cheap party trick.  If everyone is using it nobody is super.
Staged,They shoot for 16-18 hours 6 days a week so it’s easy to have an off night.  In addition the dinner service is a couple hours but they just show you the couple instances where they mess up.
Staged,"Gordon forbids instant-read thermometers just because it makes for more drama.

Every kitchen uses instant read thermometers. They are a tool, not a crutch."
Staged,[deleted]
Staged,Its more that its edited to portray things a certain way
Staged,"The producers look for a very specific type of ""chef"" when they cast for the show, they are looking for people who have worked in and even managed professional kitchens but not actual fine dining. Also who have inflated egos and who overestimate their actual cooking skill, preferably with emotional maturity deficiencies.  These producers have figured out there are plenty such people working in food service, and that they the are the perfect set up for the exact type of drama they want to create on the show.

There is a huge difference between working in a run of the mill, ""nice but not fancy"" white table cloth kind of place, and working in a place that has a Michelen star type of reputation on the line. 

Don't get me wrong, all kitchen work is demanding and oftentimes just plain hard, but it really is a whole different ball game working at the highest level of fine dining, where you're expected to hold yourself and everyone around you to the highest possible standards in everything you do. It takes years to fully acclimate to that environment, and even then it is incredibly stressful, daily. In Hell's Kitchen they try to make people who imagine themselves to be seasoned pros and try to acclimate them to that world in a matter of days, and predictably the meltdowns ensue.

No, the episodes are not staged but the dramatic blow ups are highly engineered."
Staged,"In the defense of Gordon Ramsay, I do feel as though some of the excessive drama is staged, especially in the latter seasons, but having been a line cook for most of my life, there is a BIG difference between most commercial restaurant kitchens and those of fine dining establishments. 

While I've only worked in hotel kitchens throughout the DMV, I did spend a week in an actual fine dining restaurant in New York and the level of service was on an entirely different plain of existence. 

Even with my experience, there was a much higher level of service and perfection wasnt expected, it was demanded and when I did make mistakes, they spiralled throughout the entire team. 

It was like being a part of a machine and having one bad rotation that then completely threw off the rotation cycle both metaphorically and literally."
Staged,"I'm convinced that all cooking competition shows have producer gremlins. Someone who accidentally lowers or raises the temperature of an oven, removes a needed tool, or makes sure there's only one container of a necessary ingredient to go around.

Not exactly a script, but definitely a way to manufacture drama."
Staged,"* Dinner service apparently lasts a lot longer. Like hours while serving hundreds of dishes. The camera only catches the moments that they screw up.
* Different kitchen and appliances may play a role. You are cooking in a completely alien environment compared to usual, and even the same recipe can have wildly different result depends on the heat setting etc
* Lots and lots of pressures. Competitors are locked in a dorm with no Internet and ways to contact the outside world (understandable so they can not simply leak the results etc). They also can not contact their family. Accompanied with being bombarded by GR, it happened. 

Also I think it's part of the producer effects to specifically pick certain participants with high ego and what not."
Staged,"This also seems a bit sped up probably. And a lot of these chefs are not experienced. Some are but others have only worked a couple years in kitchens. If you are throwing in the pressure, the speed, the lack of help I don’t know why you think people trying to compete with others would fail sometimes. You are also comparing a 10 dollar omelette which doesn’t even get checked probably to a 150 dollar steak which have to meet his standards."
Staged,It’s real but manufactured competition to create tension and drama. So they don’t get all the tools and are deliberately placed in very difficult situations.
Staged,It’s not one service u see. U see a week or month of service and usually they have a couple thing of each of the chef to pick over. The whole idea is for tv drama but also works to see how bad each chef will get. It is still a job competition too
Staged,"I ain't no bitch, chef"
Staged,"Trained on other menus, with more room for error, more options to correct mistakes, simpler dishes, etc...

Obvious the show is exaggerated for effect. Ramsey over-fixates on small issues because it makes good tv, but I still believe that not everyone knows how to make risotto, or properly cook Halibut. Working at IHOP doesn't teach you have to nail a scallop."
Staged,"Yes, it's staged, in the sense that the people running the show manipulate the contestants, the situations, and the editing to produce the most drama.

Even though it's called ""reality TV,"" there isn't that much that's real about it."
Staged,"Everyone here has mentioned the grocery list of reasons why it's likely staged. What I just want is for reality television to get its head out of its ass already with the kayfabe shit.

For those unfamiliar with wrestling lingo, kayfabe refers to staying in character. In the pro wrestling industry, it was standard practice up until the late 90s that performers had to stay in character in outside media as well as pretend any ongoing storylines are honest to god reality. Consequences could be severe for anybody who breaks kayfabe, as the industry was fiercely protective of the perception that pro-wrestling is a legit sport. Most people knew it was scripted, of course, but it was often hard to tell at times because nobody really knew.

That's where reality tv is at right now. We all know it's fake, but they still have their heads stuck in the sand pretending we don't. Get rid of all the stupid non-disclosure agreements where you can't talk about behind the scenes stuff even after the airdate. We know about wrestlers keeping razor blades in their wristbands, I want to know if the rumours of remote-controlled appliances are true."
Staged,"u/c_rookie - you want to address this? I wouldn't blame you if not, LOL."
Staged,"I've always felt it was fake, or at least partially. I think there are two real candidates that Ramsay picks then the rest of the chefs are cast to fill a role, much like Big Brother. They add drama with fake scoring of team based challenges, I think a lot of the outcomes from challenges and service are all planned out in advance and they stage things to help the producers narrative play out. 

Just my personal feeling I get when I watch it."
Staged,"everyone is staged. Hells Kitchen isn't the worst but it is one of the biggest. 

Ramsey picks 2-3 out of the list of everyone, then they bring in the rest. Then they go though the show. All of the appliances are 'remote controlled' go with me here. They can turn the stoves off or put the temps in the pizza oven from 400-500 in a second. You see this a lot to build drama. For example scallops. Anyone can cook them but can anyone cook them when the stove get's cooled down without anyone noticing it or heat it up and watch the fire start. Remember, how the spaghetti pot sometimes isn't at a boil and Ramsey yells? Donkey the stove isn't even on but they said they remember it. Yeah. 

It's silly stuff like that. They are always watching on the cameras and after the two weeks, they make a show out of it. Sometimes Ramsey has to reshoot something or you can pick his voice when he has to redub something. Usually, his back is to the camera when it happens. 

Then there is the chaos of calling the tickets. Some of the non-three people have never worked a line in their life. Tickets get called and Ramsey knows which ones are confused... read it back and poof, drama. 

It's not like they can't cook. It's that it's cut on the floor to look like they can't. 

If you watch the food network shows they are better at it but silly stuff still happens. 

I honestly know about all the BS but I still love watching Hells Kitchen. Usually you can pick the top 2-3 out after the third or fourth episode but it's fun to watch them do the dance."
Staged,Tv fake? No way
Staged,It's fake. A 3cstar Michellen restaurant and not a single hair net
Staged,you can walk right? why arn't you an Olympic marathon runner? it's basically just fast walking right? are you the dumbest walker on earth? why can't you win an olympic gold medal in walking fast?
Staged,"They require the cooks to make everything to-order, and eliminate a lot of shortcuts that any sane chef would use."
Staged,"All reality TV is staged to different degrees, some completely, some partially. Assuming Hell’s Kitchen is only partially staged you have to realize these chefs are learning a new kitchen, equipment, head chef, recipes, and stations while filming long hours and barely sleeping which helps nudge the drama along. Also, not all of them have experience in a high volume, busy restaurant. 

And don’t forget, editing can make you see whatever the show runners want you to."
Staged,"One-stress of competition. Two-working with those you really don't know, who are competing against you, in a kitchen not your own, doing plates, not your own."
Staged,"I mean of course it's staged. When they do the challenges it always (99% of the time anyway) comes down to the last dish or whatever to see who wins. Really??? There is NEVER a blowout by one team??? Don't get me wrong, I enjoy the show but that aspect of it always irritates me on every episode."
Staged,"As with ~~most~~ all ""reality"" TV, if it isn't outright scripted, it's mostly staged and the drama and difficulty is contrived to be more than it really is."

Modern culinary arts students study many different aspects of food.\[6\] Specific areas of study include **butchery, chemistry and thermodynamics, visual presentation, food safety, human nutrition, and physiology, international history, menu planning,** the manufacture of food items (such as the milling of wheat into flour or the refining of cane plants into crystalline sucrose), and many others.\[7\]  


>Does anyone know if the show is ridiculously staged or do they legitimately look for the worse chefs possible?

this is *next level competition.*. it's the exact same as any other ""bake off"" or ""fashion off"" or ""whatever off""..  the losing team in the championship is usually not the worst team possible.

&#x200B;

>There are ihop Chefs who can compete with busy breakfast and lunch rushes,

there are lots of people who play basketball all over the country.  very few are NBA starters.

let's not pretend **cooks** are the same as **chefs**.

perhaps you're not aware.. but in the Championship of restaurants.. (chefs only)

they pay people to go all over the ***world*** and eat in restaurants 275 days of the year.

Staged,Because capable talented chefs would make for bad tv. I think I stopped somewhere around season 8 when i binged.
Staged,"I’m sorry are you seriously asking if a reality show is staged?

How stupid are you lmao"
Staged,"I'd add that they are thrown at random stations and swap the menu constantly. Yeah, I can see how someone would make 2-3 mistakes over the course of a night (which is often enough to get sent home)."
Staged,"Most reality shows follow the same basic rules:
- Select people with personalities that are considered aggressive or abrasive.
- Keep them stressed out and sleep deprived, or occasionally drunk, to keep emotions and simple mistakes at an all-time high.
- Give them tasks and give them a time limit that is extremely difficult to meet.
- Watch the TV magic happen."
Staged,"when  i bought one for the first time about a year ago it was a lifechanger.. is that pie done in the middle? Before I'd over cook things to 'make sure' and now i stab it, the pumpkin pie filling is 200F and i'm just like yup that's it."
Staged,I remember he told one of the chefs not have one and I remember my girlfriend who was a chef at the time literally saying why? A lot of those things are pretty common now in steakhouses to save on waste. The touch and feel technique is more of a showman thing.
Staged,"This gave me a rage flashback. When I graduated high school my parents were pushing me pretty hard to do some kind of further education, so I picked cooking school. At the time the school was accredited and had a huge rep for being the Place to Go, but I had a really bad time there for several reasons. But I remember that our chef would have us make things like a genoise cake, and he’d tell us we couldn’t use stand mixers to whip the egg whites or yolks because “that’s not how real chefs do it.” (Wut)

Eventually I caught on that they actually just didn’t have enough mixers for all of us to use one and I started to get suspicious.

Anyway the environment was crazy toxic overall and I dropped out after about 4 months when my mental health absolutely tanked. My parents were maximum disappointed in me, but I got mad vindicated when the lawsuits against the school started rolling in a few years later, and it was eventually shut down after being repeatedly sued for its false claims about the success they could provide you with if you went there. Which made sense because they would get you internships after you were there for maybe 14 months, and when I quit I was working in a Papa Murphys, and a guy got hired at the Papa Murphys as his internship from the school."
Staged,"I saw a recipe video of his a few days ago.  The dude was making pasta and said in the video ""first you start with the most amazing water"" and I was like I don't think hes really a chef."
Staged,"There have been some past contestants that've talked about how the producers did all they could to fuck with the contestants. Like keeping them standing around for hours while the get enough footage of the food, how they contestants were sleep deprived  so they were constantly on edge. 

Add in the idea that there's a single dramatic person that stirs up trouble that lasts the entire length of the show until the top 5-6, I wouldn't put it past the producers from telling Gordon and the others ""Keep this person around"" and feeding the judges small guidances. It's definitely not staged but it's definitely not some ideal situation where you just have to be a good chef."
Staged,"This is something the other main posts are missing. The episodes are heavily edited, and things are sometimes out of context, stitched together, and shown out of order. If you really pay attention, you can see that the dinner service footage is sometimes not shown in proper order, a lot of times to make it look like someone's reacting to something that happened they're trying to make look like was a big deal when it wasn't."
Staged,Does the DMV have good kitchens?  I assumed if anything it would just be cafeteria and vending machine food.
Staged,"Its a 5-6 hour service that gets condensed into a 20-25 minute segment of the show. Pretty much all of the mistakes get put in the show and it really isn't a lot of them for the overall night but there is a ton of pressure to do good and Gordon really puts on the pressure for every single mistake. 

It's also very stressful because its so fast paced. The show is only filmed in a few weeks. The services are usually every single day, sometimes they skip a day but it's almost always all filmed within 5 or 6 weeks and they are working 12-16 hour days every single day"
Staged,"I totally agree with you on this. Being from the UK, I often see the US reality shows and think how unrealistic and over dramatic they are compared to the ones produced over here. 

It was at this point when I realised that all ""reality"" shows film for 4 or 5 hours a day, and for a week, or a month. Then they just hand pick all the most dramatic and exciting/interesting footage that they imagine will keep people watching, you can imagine how much content ends up on the cutting room floor and how many times people have arguments or screaming fits at each other. 

Same with the talent shows on TV when they have the crazy nutjobs on, you know they were already aware of this before letting them on, so why do it? Just for views, much more interesting than boring people who are talented."
Staged,"I did a lot of restaurant kitchen work back in college and for a while afterwards, so I have a good idea of how the back of the house actually works. It amuses me no end to watch Hell's Kitchen because a lot of the contestants look like they'd struggle to make eggs and sausage for the family on a Sunday morning."
Staged,Even fucking Dr. Phil uses methods like this.
Staged,"Exactly, just shake up the coke bottle til it explodes"
Staged,"That’s unsafe. You need the pumpkin pie to be over 212 for safe consumption.   You gotta boil that sumbitch

Edit: people really needed the /s huh"
Staged,">he’d tell us we couldn’t use stand mixers to whip the egg whites or yolks because “that’s not how real chefs do it.

Lmao I don't get why schools impose such artificial limitations on students. It's like a programming class that says you're not allowed to use code libraries. But in a professional industry time is money, and everyone uses a library if they can."
Staged,"> lasts the entire length of the show until the top 5-6,

that must be why in the final rounds it gets so professional"
Staged,"It's also been stated that the producers and crew will outright fuck with them in the kitchen, like turn off/change the heat on a burner/stove, hide ingredients, move things from where they left them, etc."
Staged,"He means the DC, Maryland and Virginia corridor. Not the Dept. of Motor Vehicles."
Staged,"Considering I've worked in the cities of D.C, Baltimore, Alexandria and Hyattsville, I would say that assumption is entirely wrong. 

Several of the hotels and restaurants I've worked at in those cities have been highly rated and while not fine dining, the kitchens were rather well to do in most respects. 

I only jumped around because I cant sit still and being young at that time, I wanted to learn everything from everyone. 

Only reason why I remain at my current job is because I'm the only Black female chef there and I'm arrogant enough to say that I can cook circles around my colleagues."
Staged,"I would agree especially risotto and scallions...

THEY ARE BURNED YOU DONKEY!!!!!!!!!!!!"
Staged,"You said “even Dr Phil” like Dr Phil isn’t one of the biggest pieces of shit on the planet. He is a grifter, con man."
Staged,LeVar Burton does not endorse or approve boiling any sums of bitches.
Staged,"Not using code libraries at the beginning kind of makes sense though, cause your usually meant to learn Gad algorithms behind those libraries at that point"
Staged,"""Been stated that""? Has there been anything other that a reddit post by a fan suggesting that as a possibility?"
Staged,">and crew will outright fuck with them in the kitchen

Um, isnt there any sexual allegations in this regard? They should outright sue them because of this."
Staged,"DC, Maryland, Virginia."
Staged,I think they thought Dept. of Motor Vehicles lol. As a Baltimoron myself most people that aren't from around dunno DMV🤣
Staged,Oh…. I seriously thought you worked at the Department of Motor Vehicles.  Now it makes sense.
Staged,"It was a season 6 contestant, Tek Moore."
Staged,"Two contestants, Jen Yemola and Tek Moore, both stated that a lot of the drama was artificially created (and that Gordon Ramsey was fed lines through an ear piece).

But really, it's common in reality television."
Staged,"""fuck with them"" means mess with their heads - so if someone leaves the paprika on their station, someone on the crew will grab it and move it to another contestant's station, for example"
Staged,Corrected.
Staged,"You're fine mate, I really need to get out of that Marylander habit of not spelling out that acronym."
Staged,The idea of certain dmvs having high end fine dining is pretty funny.
Staged,Heard them interviewing someone about all the labour strikes on News Hour this morning and when he brought up that even some BBC employees were striking she blew past it. Was pretty funny
Staged,"I’m not British, but between this and the MotD stuff, the BBC seems like a mess right now?"
Staged,"I'm Canadian, and we have the CBC, which is our version of the BBC. I am well aware of the shortcomings and issues of a publicly-funded broadcaster that theoretically exists to speak to the center of a country's values and ideologies.

I've worked in the industry and have seen the MANY ways that shooting for an ""objective"" or ""neutral"" voice leads to reporting that at best, says nothing of deeper value or insight, and at worst actively protects the status quo. These are all valid concerns.

But I've also seen what a lack of having a large, well-funded, public-interest media presence looks like, because I've seen America. I find it absolutely absurd that there's just no neutral function in American media. You have, what, PBS and NPR? The former rarely engages in news reporting, and the latter has been pigeonholed as a lefty elitist podcast enclave. Which means that the biggest options are run like a business and need to compete with both pure entertainment products AND opposing news networks that have no mandate to report on facts and reality, period.

If you remove a public service to replace it with a private one, you haven't proven that it wasn't needed or wanted. You've just shown that you want to control that service for profit or propaganda. Or both. And that's what this strike is about. The roles and shows being marked for redundancy will be paid for elsewhere: either through privately-owned alternatives, or through the ultimate consequences of this starve-the-beast approach to killing public support of public services.

The CBC is boring and stale and often leaves a lot to be desired. And...that's what the news is SUPPOSED TO DO. At the very least, I trust it to deliver an acceptably accurate explanation of a current event. 

Look at what happens when people can't agree on a shared set of reality-defining facts, and tell me that MORE of this is good for our collective future."
Staged,"In today's news.  BBC anounce a new weekly program called We all love Rishi.  When asked if this was within program guidelines, we were told, to quote ""shove it""."

What both need is legislation guaranteeing public funding and complete autonomy from political and corporate influence. Fact based news held to the highest standard possible. That won’t happen because the powerful love to use all media as their own little propaganda toys.  Want to see just how corrupt they will go? Read the transcripts and text messages in the Dominion Voting Systems vs. Fox News. They knowingly spread misinformation for money."

>A Cardiff University analysis of BBC news coverage in 2009 (under Labour) and 2015 (under the Conservative-led coalition) counted how often it mentioned think tanks categorised as left-leaning, right-leaning or neutral in both years, finding a broad balance in 2009 but a clear bias to the right in 2015: “When Labour was in power [in 2009], the BBC’s use of think tanks was relatively even-handed, but when a Conservative-led coalition was in power [in 2015], the centre of gravity [in the BBC’s coverage] shifted to the political right.”

>Another study, by two London-based academics, found that during the 2017 general election campaign, 69 per cent of the newspaper stories featured on the BBC’s daily late-night TV show The Papers were from Conservative-supporting papers versus only 23 per cent from those supporting Labour and 8 per cent from those supporting other parties (such as Ukip or the Lib Dems). Of those studio guests representing a paper with a clear party affiliation, 68 per cent were also Conservatives. However much this may reflect the political bias in the newspaper landscape, it again shows that claims of lefty favouritism are simply untrue.

>The presenter said the corporation’s bosses panicked after Maitlis told Newsnight viewers in 2020 that Johnson’s former aide had “broken the rules” and “the country can see that, and it’s shocked the government cannot”.

>Maitlis said the programme initially “passed off with a few pleasant texts from BBC editors and frankly little else”.

>She added: “It was only the next morning that the wheels fell off. A phone call of complaint was made from Downing Street to the BBC News management. This, for context, is not unusual.
>
>“What was not foreseen was the speed with which the BBC sought to pacify the complainant. Within hours, a very public apology was made, the programme was accused of a failure of impartiality, the recording disappeared from iPlayer, and there were paparazzi outside my front door.
>
>“Why had the BBC immediately and publicly sought to confirm the government spokesman’s opinion? Without any kind of due process? It makes no sense for an organisation that is admirably, famously rigorous about procedure – unless it was perhaps sending a message of reassurance directly to the government itself?

>“Put this in the context of the BBC Board, where another active agent of the Conservative party – former Downing Street spin doctor, and former adviser to BBC rival GB News – now sits, acting as the arbiter of BBC impartiality.”

>Let me take you this time to early 2016. The UK is beginning to debate the big questions around Britain’s potential exit from the EU. It is complicated stuff: we are trying to offer our viewers both sides of a fiendishly difficult debate. And that intention was right. But we still got it wrong. We fell into what we might call “the Patrick Minford paradigm”. In other words, it might take our producers five minutes to find 60 economists who feared Brexit and five hours to find a sole voice who espoused it. But by the time we went on air, we simply had one of each; we presented this unequal effort to our audience as balance. It wasn’t.

>We show our impartiality when we report without fear or favour. When we are not scared to hold power to account, even when it feels uncomfortable to do so. When we understand that if we’ve covered rule-breaking by a Scottish chief medical officer or an English government scientist then journalistic rigour should be applied to those who make policy within No 10. The one person – ironically – who understood this was Dominic Cummings himself. Who texted me that very evening to offer his wry support.

Staged,"What's the problem.  It's government owned, just increase the license fee and pay the bums."
Staged,Your apology means fuck all when you literally are the mouthpiece of the current government. A government that often tries to pass laws that are called out for being pretty n*zi like.
Staged,were sorry that were such big scumbags that most of our workers are striking right now.
Staged,What bombshell dropped on this comment section.
Staged,BBC trying really hard to appear the victim.
Staged,"Don't apologize, treat your workers better."
Staged,Or just apologize for mediocre pay and working conditions? Easy to make it up to the strikers.
Staged,"Oh no!!! What will we do without dancing stars, people baking and D listens being lost on an island?"
Staged,"What I wouldn't do to live in a world where instead of this, BBC apologizes to its audiences for not paying or respecting their workers more, and making amends because of that."
Staged,"Oh FFS, just pay them! They are not asking for anything crazy."
Staged,misspelt cunts
Staged,The best apology would be to give the staff the stuff they are asking for
Staged,So who else is going on strike over there? I got friends heading over in a few days
Staged,I just googled BBC and seems like there is still plenty of content being aired.  Lots of notable clips and videos.
Staged,"Bring back Clarkson, Hammond, and May!"
Staged,"If it weren't for the news, I wouldn't have known they were on strike."
Staged,"In other words, the BBC isn’t on the employees side. Nor on the tax payers it seems.

Then again they are ran by the right and refuse to air documentaries about the state of the planet. Don’t know if there’s much left to save soon."
Staged,Maybe instead of apologizing to viewers you should apologize to your staff. Just a thought.
Staged,Don't  apologize.  Take care of the strike which you've created.
Staged,I read this as Big Black Cock apologizes.....
Staged,Sure does sound like the person running this place should be fired.

Young Wallander, I wonder if he is smarter than Young Sheldon. It's too bad this one wasn't set in the past like the novels it may have allowed for it to be unique.
Young Wallander,This is good news! I enjoyed the last Young Wallander.
Young Wallander,"The second season was subpar compared to the first, lots of nonsensical plot holes.... pity, I enjoyed all the Wallander iterations over the years and this had potential."
Young Wallander,"
>* When the older brother is finally released, the younger brother decides it would be a great idea to fill him in on what really happened.  But the girl is psychic.  She knows what he intends to do, and where he'll be. 

I assume he must've told her he was going to tell his brother. I don't think she knew where he was going to be but the army guy followed him and when he saw him go to the club then he knew he had an opening."
Young Wallander,Thanks for saving me from watching anymore. I’m on episode 2 and was curious if it gets better. Sounds like no.  I cannot understand how a human mind actually writes this shit
Young Wallander,Partially through this drek. How did Soren know where the detective lives?
Young Wallander,I really enjoyed the first season. But season 2 just didn’t make any sense
Young Wallander,Looks a bit too generic maybe? Anyway will reserve judgement when the series hits. Check out Kenneth Branagh’s Wallander series if you haven’t
Young Wallander,added to list.  I enjoyed the originals
Young Wallander,I hope they acquire Wallander. I've always wanted to watch it.
Young Wallander,"Looks interesting. Probably best to think of it less like a prequel and more as a reboot of the character. 

Interestingly, you would think at first glance that the 'immigration conflict' story-arc has been put in place to make the show more relevant to 2020, but in fact, the very first Wallander novel *Faceless Killers* also touched upon immigration (albeit not very directly). So in that regard, while the show might be a bit more action-oriented and thriller-ish, its faithful to the spirit of Henning Mankell's original work."
Young Wallander,If you like generic stories and a Wallander that whispers the entire series. Youre gonna love it.
Young Wallander,I was hoping this was about the legendary [Flying Wallendas. ](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Flying_Wallendas)
Young Wallander,"""Wallander, where are you going?""

""I need to buy a chair. I'm thinking Midcentury Modern."""
Young Wallander,"Jesus, this was bad."
Young Wallander,"> Check out Kenneth Branagh’s Wallander series if you haven’t

so damn good."
Young Wallander,"I JUST got done with Kenneth's Wallander series like 1-2 weeks ago, and it's so damn good!"
Young Wallander,But which original? Branagh or Henriksson?
Young Wallander,I'd this a prequel show or something? I've never heard of Wallander.
Young Wallander,There's also the Swedish films with Rolf Lassgård.
Young Wallander,Both but I would rank Branagh as superior
Young Wallander,Always Branagh.
Young Wallander,Yeah. There’s a BBC Kenneth Branagh adaptation of the novels.
Young Wallander,Try to find the original Swedish episodes.
The Platform,Doing this when Succession and Barry's final seasons are about to start is pretty cruel.
The Platform,No. 😭😭😭
The Platform,"With F1 gone and now HBO, that's a lot of value proposition removed from Hotstar. It's purely the Premier League streamer now for me, which funnily enough is why I got it originally years ago.

Edit: I also want to know what this means for other stuff like the FX shows. I watched The Bear on Hotstar, are those getting removed now too?"
The Platform,Is HBO OTT coming to India?
The Platform,Goddamnit. Istg if I have to wait to watch Succession S4
The Platform,Do TV shows that have a particularly American cultural context like Barry or Station 11 play well in India?
The Platform,Can they add all the content from Hotstar to Hulu here in the US already?
The Platform,Does anyone have any idea if these shows will be moved to any other streaming services?
The Platform,"FX shows are from Disney themselves so I don't think they would be removed. This is the deal with HBO/Warner coming to an end, shouldn't affect anything else."
The Platform,">Warner Bros Discovery (WBD) scrapped plans to launch HBO Max in India last year. Local industry analysts have speculated that WBD will expand its partnership with Amazon Prime Video in India, which already carries the HBO Max originals. WBD declined to comment when contacted by Deadline."
The Platform,"They'll likely make a deal with another streamer. Amazon is the likely one, they apparently already have some HBO Max titles and they have done this type of deal in other countries without HBO Max"
The Platform,That's good to know at least.
The Platform,"My guess is that there’re waiting to launch their new service which will replace HBO Max, totally unnecessary imo but that’s what they want to do…"
The Platform,Is HBO going to their service? And any idea by when it is leaving Hotstar?
The Platform,Check out r/IndiaEntertainment for discussions and news about streaming services in India.
The Platform,"As per tweets from Hotstar, HBO Originals are leaving Hotstar on 31st March."
The Platform,Fuck. What does that mean for Succession and Barry's season 4s?
The Platform,A lot of news outlets are claiming that they'll launch a Prime Video Channel. Or most probably they'll make these shows available when they launch their new streaming service merged with Discovery+.
The Platform,"I wouldn't mind a Prime Video Channel since I already got it after Mad Men went there.

I really can't wait until next year to watch Succession and Barry end lol.

Thanks for the info anyway."
The Platform,Well... That's a sign.
The Platform,"I mean their catalogue is kind of lackluster if you’re not into comics or SW, tbh. Other than nostalgia factor for cartoons like Tail Spin, what else is worth watching?"
The Platform,Well maybe make some new shows that aren't marvel related....
The Platform,Why not have one month free trial you cowards.
The Platform,"> Disney has reportedly sent out direct mailers offering free seven-day trials to subscription streaming video service Disney+. The platform, launched in November 2019, had dropped the free trial promotion in June 2020.


> Since launching, Disney+ has grown subscribers exponentially, ending the most-recent fiscal period with 103 million subscribers. But CEO Bob Chapek this week told an investor event that the streaming service’s sub growth in the fourth quarter would be challenged — especially by events in India and Latin America.

> India, which represents a third of all Disney+ subscribers, saw the start of cricket’s Indian Premier League rescheduled due to the pandemic. Disney+ Hotstar is an exclusive distributor of IPL, and many of the service’s annual subscriptions are set to expire in the quarter. By law, annual video subscriptions in India do not automatically renew.


> Chapek said affected Disney+ Hotstar subs in India would have to be resigned to the service...

> Disney+ in March raised its subscription price for the first time by $1 to $7.99. The price for the Disney bundle, which includes ESPN+ and Hulu, also increased $1 to $13.99."
The Platform,"I mean, there’s just not enough good, varied, content on the platform. There’s like 1000 new animated / live action Star Wars shows coming out, focusing on side characters only die hard fans care about… which is great for die hard Star Wars fans, but there’s no appeal for a casual fan who also wants more diverse content."
The Platform,I subscribed a couple of times and then ended my subscription. First for Hamilton. Then for Soul. More recently I almost subscribed again for Black Widow but fortunately realized that it was not included in the regular subscription plan. (Which is really stupid of them imho.) I’m 50 with no kids and I love Marvel and Star Wars but I have a busy life and am not going to sit down and watch one of those films AGAIN. The what if series and Star Wars anime stuff looks fun but as an busy adult it really needs to be worthwhile.
The Platform,"That's a bit of a shock, Disney+ was one of the biggest successes over the last two years. I haven't kept good track lately, but I guess this means their meteoric rise hit an asteroid or something? Or are they trying to get a rush of subscribers right before an investor call or something?"
The Platform,good thing I'm getting that 12 month code from Salesforce.
The Platform,"As a nearly 30-year-old man, the only reason I would ever get Disney+ is with the bundle."
The Platform,They are just preparing to show trailers for new projects and wanna get people on board
The Platform,Just after I subscribed for Visions!
The Platform,[deleted]
The Platform,"In the US, they seem to struggling because of the hyper focus on family audience. They should definitely try to bring Star to the US even if that ends up competing with Hulu. Hulu can continue buying third party content and they can feed Star by showing the first party mature shows there and also put in the FX library on Disney+. That'd make Disney+ a viable option in the US."
The Platform,Depends where you are in the world. Ever since they added Star to the UK subscription we use Disney+ more than any of the other streaming subscriptions.
The Platform,"Even if you’re into comics. You can only watch endgame so many times. 

The shows like Loki and captain America are solid, but the seasons are very short. What if is pretty fucking terrible"
The Platform,Simpsons
The Platform,Lmaoo You're an idiot if you think the Marvel shows have anything to do with comics other than using them as a source material.
The Platform,Tell that to adobe
The Platform,"> By law, annual video subscriptions in India do not automatically renew.

Pretty cool of the Indian government lol"
The Platform,[deleted]
The Platform,"They grew too fast, that's the problem.

Now, they're running out of new reasons to get subscribers, most people who were going to get Disney Plus, already have it anyway"
The Platform,"In the US maybe, the rest of the world has plenty of mature content on there"
The Platform,Yeah star wars and marvel can do so much to get the  older demographic vwith no kids.
The Platform,The issue with that is that they cannot merge Hulu into Disney+ until 2024 when Universal agreed to sell. Also there’s the fun wrinkle then that some of the Marvel movies will return to Netflix for a bit because of an old deal.
The Platform,Why bother? They will buy out Comcast in 2024 and can combine the services after that with ease. Hulu has to many ongoing contracts and licences. By the time they got rid of them it will be time to fold Hulu into Disney+ anyway.
The Platform,"Is it? Given that COVID **appears** to be lightening down, is it possible that people are cutting subs since they can go outside again? Alternatively, is Disney doing particularly badly, or is the entire Streaming market down?"
The Platform,The whole point of Star is because Hulu doesn’t exist internationally
The Platform,"I think now that they have much mother to offer (Turner and Hooch, the Doogie Howser reboot and much more teen angled movies) that they can attract a much boarder audience now than just the Disney people.

Now that they have the entire Fox catalog, what they should do is that they should put some of the 20th Century Fox stuff on there. It would work."
The Platform,I agree. Living in Canada and star is fantastic. So much access to adult content.
The Platform,Firm disagree on What If being terrible.
The Platform,"They have a solid trickle of shows but that’s it. I’m usually only on there for one at a time. I have the Hulu, ESPN+, D+ bundle and use them all to a degree so it’s worth it to me but I couldn’t really see the benefit in keeping a solid subscription to it if you don’t have kids."
The Platform,"i also think more people are just alternating between streaming services.  the market is crowded, but they all make it really easy to cancel or renew with a few buttons.    
  
I had D+ for a little while, but currently theres nothing exciting enough to make me renew. when they get something good1, i'll probably rejoin. i expect over the next few years we will see increasing deals for buying a whole year's subscription compared to monthly"
The Platform,They also had the second highest churn from last month. Only Paramount+ had worse
The Platform,They definitely bring in high numbers of people but they don't help with the churn rate. Disney should create a single global approach like Netflix because their multi app strategy is very confusing for the general people who aren't spending hours on subs like these.
The Platform,[deleted]
The Platform,They do have the Hulu + Disney+ and ESPN + bundle for like $20 a month. That covers pretty much the entire family. I imagine they'd promote it more once they own the whole thing.
The Platform,"In addition, right now they only have What If for Marvel. There really isn't anything going on. I bet a lot of people who subscribed for those shows un subscribed."
The Platform,"Marvel movies will return to Netflix in 2026 and iirc the last film to fall into that deal was Black Panther so everything that came after it should be safe. 

I'm not saying they should merge Hulu with Disney+, which as you said isn't possible. I'm saying that they could add the Star tile in the US and drop the first party mature shows like Only Murders in the Building, Dopesick, Reservation Dogs etc. on Disney+ rather than Hulu. This will increase the appeal to more mature audience."
The Platform,By then their competitors would have acquired those customers that are in the market looking for services that can serve all their needs. Netflix and HBO Max are the biggest ones in that regard. Streaming game is about getting and then retaining customers which Disney+ isn't doing well in the US. Netflix and HBO Max have content that is both popular and also serves the needs of all families by serving almost each content category. I'm not saying that everyone subscribes to only two streamers but there are a lot of people who do that and Disney+ would end up losing that section of the market.
The Platform,"Disney is not doing particularly badly outside the US. But that's because the variety of content they have outside the US is better because of addition of Star.  

Star is a brand they use to distribute more mature shows made by FX, ABC Signature, 20th Television, Hulu etc. and market them as Star Originals. Star also includes library content from all the Disney brands that are not Disney, Pixar, Marvel, Star Wars and NatGeo. 

Coming back to the US, the originals are spread very thin and a lot of those don't really appeal to a lot of people. Disney+ Originals also tend to be franchise heavy which guarantees a large number of audience coming in but they also leave whenever shows from their favorite franchise end leading to a huge churn rate. Disney+ US is among the services with highest churn rates. 

My concern is that not building customer loyalty now would hurt Disney in future. Most of the users would choose services like Netflix, HBO Max etc. which offer a more all round streaming experience rather than being specific to one type of content."
The Platform,"A lot of the 20th Century Studios stuff is still tied up in old contracts. Even the new films from the studio go to HBO Max and that contract expires in 2022 so that means everything that's released up until that point will go to HBO Max after its theatrical release. They have uploaded a small amount of 20th Century films that aren't tied up in pre-existing contracts. 

Also, I think you are overestimating the appeal of all the Disney+ shows that you mentioned."
The Platform,"Unfortunately, we all know that they will catch on to this little tactic at some point"
The Platform,"Yeah that's a huge problem, Peacock might have more, but the numbers are kind of fudged with Comcast giving it out for free"
The Platform,"Don’t forget the complicated mess that is ESPN. Most of it’s still on the regular channel, but parts of it are on ESPN+. Then there’s them doing the same overseas (and locking down the NHL in its entirety overseas), but you have to go through a cable provider for any of that."
The Platform,You should check out Mysterious Benedict Society then. A really good show that got lost in the heaps of franchise related stuff on Disney+. And just today it was renewed for Season 2.
The Platform,All their originality is spent on Disney channel sitcoms.
The Platform,That show is literally a copy of the movie R.I.P.D with Ryan Reynolds but people think I'm stupid for saying that. It's literally almost the same in some parts.
The Platform,"Once they own Hulu completely, they'll likely merge it into Disney+. No point in keeping them separate and trying to acquire subscribers on two services instead of one."
The Platform,"Yeah I rarely go to Disney+ to find a new show to watch.
I watch some of their new shows, but when it's the weekend and I'm looking for something to watch, it's still back to Netflix."
The Platform,But then there's no reason to subscribe to Hulu.
The Platform,"Disney+ has more customers in the US than any streaming service outside of Netflix and Amazon. Pretty impressive for a streamer that is not even 2 years old. It tops 100 million worldwide. Hulu already has another 40 odd million subscribers. Disney are pushing the bundle hard. A decent strategy considering the whole bundle only comes in around the same price as HBO Max and Netflix! 

Rather than being “left behind” Disney are growing their services at a far faster rate than any of their rivals. The last couple of quarters have just been a dip in the road for the big established players like Netflix, Disney, and Hulu. They will gain in higher rates again when they get better content. Which Q4 will have for Disney and Netflix and Q3 already had for Hulu. 

All that said, Disney are aware that a separate Disney and Hulu causes issues (it also has benefits) but it still does not seem constructive to try and add adult content to Disney+ US until they can do it properly sometime late 2024 or into 2025 after the Comcast buyout. A lot of the ABC and FX stuff on Hulu will be under existing licensing deals for years which means they would have to create new content just for an adult hub on US Disney+. That is just needlessly expensive and counterproductive considering that by the time they had a significant amount of shows ready to make an impact they would be in full control of Hulu anyway and able to merge the services."
The Platform,"They're also pretty slow with new content. What If or The Bad Batch doesn't interest most people and since they finished the stretch of MCU shows with Loki, they don't have much. People probably start to rotate streaming services more considering the number there are available"
The Platform,I'm factoring in the nostalgia factor that kind works in weird ways here.
The Platform,What can they really do about it though?
The Platform,Tbh I don't want them to add ESPN content to Disney+. That'll just make a mess because sports rights in the US are so complicated.
The Platform,Maybe because most people know the trope of a person being arrested and getting pressed into helping the police really isn’t something that was invented in a 2013 Ryan Reynolds movie and beyond that and the fact that both at the most generic possible level have a supernatural theme they really aren’t similar.
The Platform,Netflix still remains supreme as the streaming service you open when you don't know what to watch. All the others you open to find specific shows
The Platform,"Yeah, the only thing I am watching is What If weekly and watching Visions. I was watching The Simpsons and Rebels but I got the deal with HBO so for the most part, just watching stuff on HBO and Apple."
The Platform,"You say combining apps is counter productive but considering a large portion of households only have 1 sub going on at a time Netflix and Amazon are direct competitors.

55%ish Google shows have more then one sub, for all the others (3/4 households have a sub) they need a reason to pick you over the guy.

So Disney can run the analysis all they want if it's worth it or not, but at the end of the day there's only so much going around right now."
The Platform,"Bury the cancelation tab, phase out monthly subscriptions entirely"
The Platform,Have you even watched it lmao? It's more similiar than that.
The Platform,"The streaming pie gets bigger and bigger with each passing year. Disney have not had a single quarter where they lost subscribers! The average number of streaming subscriptions for US households is now up to 4. 

I’m not saying Disney will not see a combined service as their future. I’m just saying that there is no point in doing it until they are rid of Comcast in the US. They have basically done it already in international markets. They cannot in the US as if they are seen as sabotaging Hulu that is grounds for a massive legal case and potentially billions of dollars worth of damages in Comcast’s favour. Far easier just to wait another 3 years. 

Disney (with Disney+/Hulu/ESPN+) along with Netflix and Amazon have already established themselves at the top of the streaming market. It will be very difficult for anyone to dislodge that trio. The only one with a chance is HBO Max. Considering the streaming average is 4 then all four of those companies look pretty safe. 

It is the others that need to worry about being left on the outside. Paramount+, Showtime, Peacock, Starz, Apple, Epix, and AMC+ are all facing an uphill battle to make a big enough impact in streaming."
The Platform,I have. It isn’t.
The Platform,"A lot of their growth of late has been tied to the fact that they have the IPL rights in India. Once the IPL is over, you will see those numbers fall off."
The Platform,Oh okay.
The Platform,"Their growth in the US & Canada and in Europe has been very good. They might be facing a few issues in India but growth has been very good in other markets and they are in a strong position worldwide. They are expanding into South America and East Asia. That will only result in greater growth. 

Be interesting to see if the Hotstar numbers do plunge in the coming months."
The Platform,"Actually Netflix did a crossover event in August called *Game On* with four family sitcoms - *The Big Show Show, Mr. Inglesias, The Expanding Universe Of Ashley Garcia* and *Family Reunion.*"
The Platform,"Whatever shows you want to use, the anchor would have to be Stranger Things, I think it's become the most popular and most recognizable Netflix show across the most age groups and demographics and the use of the upsidedown and Eleven's powers could set up connecting other established shows to create a shared universe"
The Platform,Dead to Me and Santa Clarita Diet have fun crossover potential
The Platform,Have you watched their hallmark-esque Christmas movies? They are way ahead of you.
The Platform,"GLOW and 'Dead to Me', of course. Betty Gilpin's character is a friend and a client of the Christine Applegate's mother-in-law, she bought a great house in the neighborhood. Mark Maron's character lives in the facility for old people where Linda Cardellini's character works, perhaps he was duped for money by her husband."
The Platform,House of Cards and Ozark
The Platform,Russian Doll x The OA
The Platform,[deleted]
The Platform,"Huh. I watch Netflix daily and heavily browse through all the categories, and I haven't heard of a single one of those shows."
The Platform,"I don't know exactly how this would work as I haven't gotten past season 1 of Dark, but I think Dark could probably end up tying right into Stranger Things."
The Platform,"Sex Education is incredibly acclaimed, even by the critics that tend to say snobby bullshit like you just did."

The Platform,Username checks out.
The Platform,What other new stuff has been released since May 31?
Chefs Table: BBQ,"Best Netflix docu-series, and it ain’t even close, IMO"
Chefs Table: BBQ,"Chef's Table is my favorite cooking show, will be looking forward to this."
Chefs Table: BBQ,"This is such a fun series. Really beautiful style, and glad they're going a bit of a focused direction with BBQ here as I loved the pastry one.

[For those that haven't seen it, IFC's Documentary Now! did a great parody episode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47j9jWMegUs) as well, super funny."
Chefs Table: BBQ,"Premieres September 2nd, for those unable to watch."
Chefs Table: BBQ,I fucking love this show
Chefs Table: BBQ,I once saw this food series on BBQ.  It went to the best places in the US.  A lot of them were in my neck of the woods but the one that stood out was in Cali.  This couple was from KC but moved to Cali.  They got a small hut at the farmers market.  The line is so long people don't even get to eat before they run out of food.  It made me realise that a lot of states don't have good BBQ.  It's sort of sad really.
Chefs Table: BBQ,Omg. I picked a damn good time finally dig in to this series. Just in time for this one!
Chefs Table: BBQ,Looks like the most interesting one they have done of these.
Chefs Table: BBQ,I love all the food docuseries to be honest. They're great
Chefs Table: BBQ,"It was actually a parody of Jiro Dreams of Sushi, an earlier work by the creator of Chef's Table, but I still loved it, the way they parodied the father/son dynamic of the original movie was great"
Chefs Table: BBQ,David Gelb has been amazing for Netflix
Chefs Table: BBQ,Ahh that makes sense too. I always figured Jiro Dreams of Sushi was the inspiration for a lot of the later food docs on Netflix.
Chefs Table: BBQ,"I kinda want to know more about the ""You are going to die unless you stop making pizza"" bit. Rough quote, I know.

I spent my Summer watching all of MasterChef and MasterChef Junior because I am pathetic, and this looks pretty interesting."
Chefs Table: BBQ,"I watched this last night. Not to knock Chef Bianco, surely his pizza is amazing and has inspired thousand's of pizza makers all over Europe and the USA, this Neapolitan artisan style is now widespread and to be honest, has gotten a bit gentrified and boring. I eat this stuff all the time now, of course better than some shitty train station pizza slice, but I have also had some pretty fucking good pizza from places that don't have a wood oven, hand squeezed tomato sauce, perfectly mixed and proofed 00 dough and new york mozzarella. Just some mom and pop love on the back streets of Italy with a fuck load of cheese and fennel sausage."
Chefs Table: BBQ,"I’m watching this right now. Chef’s Table is so pretentious, and that’s coming from someone who loves pretentious food. Like do we need the classical music intro and 100 slow motion shots of the chefs smelling a tomato on an organic farm?"
Chefs Table: BBQ,Gonna be watching this while eating Domino's.
Chefs Table: BBQ,"How could it ever compete with the Hulu show though? (/s)

Chefs Table: BBQ,Chefs table pizza: we travel around the world to bake the fun out of pizza.
Chefs Table: BBQ,"Awesome. They made a whole show about pizza and skipped the most important pizza city in the world, and only did one style more or less."
Chefs Table: BBQ,"What we need is a Jon Stewart documentary about Pizza, where he spends the last 10 minutes going into vivid comedic details into why Chicago Deep Dish is the worst thing ever.

Chefs Table: BBQ,"Really wish they would have featured an NY spot like L&B's Spumoni, a Detroit style joint, something unique"
Chefs Table: BBQ,"My guess it would be the fumes from the wood oven, I think on those kind of wood burning ovens, the only place for air to escape is through the front entry."
Chefs Table: BBQ,“The best pizza is in the alleys of Italy 🥱” *flips hair* *adjusts Gucci sunglasses*
Chefs Table: BBQ,Chef's Table is good for flipping through to various food and scenery highlights.

Chefs Table: BBQ,We can argue if deep dish is not pizza but deep dish is fucken delicious.
Chefs Table: BBQ,"You are required to have the same venting just like any oven. Commercial ones require the same, or you will be fined, and cannot open."
Chefs Table: BBQ,"That is your own quote. Some things just shouldn't be gentrified. Pizza is not meant to be gourmet, it is street food... People like Bianco's for two reasons, 1) they source high quality ingredients, 2) The have to queue all morning"
Chefs Table: BBQ,Yeah it’s a pretty show that’s for sure
Chefs Table: BBQ,"I mean I agree with you, but the whole concept of Chef’s Table is taking something and making it gourmet. Idk what annoyed me about your comment is that you’re saying pizza should be ungentrified street food but you’re still making a judgement call as to what’s good or bad street food (Mom and Pop shops in Italy are good but train station food is bad). 

Doesn’t ungentrified just mean a poor urban area? Like poor people today are gonna eat the cheap shit pizza at the train station because it’s cheap and convenient. Also homeless people in NY go to $1 slice places because …it’s cheap. So we should eat food of the working class if it’s 19th-c working class but not the 21st c working class?

I think this show is guilty of overly romanticizing the past, and of how people used to eat. I really doubt poor 19th c Italians were eating Bianco-style pizzas. Also there were waves of immigration to the US because people wanted to get tf out of Italy. 

Anyways just a few thoughts"
Chefs Table: BBQ,"well pizza in Italy used to be just flat bread... wasn't until Italians went to America that they turned it into some gooey mess. that was exported around the world. Just saying I have had great, if not better pizza in Italy and America than this new style pizza they have everywhere now. And by train station I meant like frozen pizza dough, ingredients etc, baked next to kebabs and asian noodles."
Chefs Table: BBQ,Yeah true true
Chefs Table: BBQ,Oh my gosh…. That would be so scary. I can hear Mads say….. try the liver…. It’s fresh.
Chefs Table: BBQ,"Fans will put Vivaldi's Four Seasons (Concerto No. 4 in F minor) over *anything* to put together a *Chef's Table* parody trailer of their own. Youtube is littered with them.

Just me, but while it's an okay idea, I'm all \[shrug\]. The [original rolodex/recipe box montage of Hannibal cooking to *Faust*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx89rSN0I28) was just **so** much better."
Chefs Table: BBQ,"Lol what? You missed the point of the video altogether. Hannibal always featured beautiful cooking sequences, so this person edited together a fake Chef's Table intro for Hannibal. The link you posted is just a random scene from Hannibal. Also, yes Concerto No. 4 in F minor is literally used as the Chef's Table intro song."
Chefs Table: BBQ,"Oh, no I got the point. It just wasn't nearly as funny, pointed, or smart as the other *Chef's Table* parodies like that that abound on Youtube:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-lfBiatGD8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-lfBiatGD8)

Using *Hannibal* footage? While the *original* footage is actually far more on-point than the parody? It's just dumb."
Chefs Table: BBQ,"Ugly Delicious is great as well. And Salt Fat Acid Heat.  Also Cooked, as has already been mentioned. Netflix has some fantastic food shows."
Chefs Table: BBQ,Add Jon Favreau food truck show to the list. All of these shows are food porn at its best
Chefs Table: BBQ,"Chefs table has a lot of great cinematography, but I wish it focused more on the food and less on how hard the chefs life has been.

I don't particularly care about how you grew up poor, but I am interested to understand and watch your process for creating and serving amazing food."
Chefs Table: BBQ,Ugly delicious is also quite good. The first episode is the worst of the series so you might not want to start with that one.
Chefs Table: BBQ,"It also helps that Netflix is streaming those shows in 4K HDR. If you own a good TV, the food just looks awesome."
Chefs Table: BBQ,"""Cooked"" is fantastic too. You should add that to your list of you haven't watched it yet"
Chefs Table: BBQ,Agree! 100%
Chefs Table: BBQ,David Gelb is behind both. He also did a pretty famous documentary called Jiro Dreams of Sushi (also on Netflix). It's great if you haven't seen it.
Chefs Table: BBQ,"My favorites so far have been Ugly Delicious (stoked for a new season) and also Somebody Feed Phil. I actually got to use one of Phil’s suggestions, which is the first time I’ve ever been to a place I only saw on a TV Show."
Chefs Table: BBQ,Was about to upvote you for Ugly Delicious but I thought SFAH was absolute trash.
Chefs Table: BBQ,"I don't like Chef's Table anymore to be honest. It used to focus on demystifying the cult of technical, Michelin star cooking with chefs as rock stars and food as a challenge. I thought it was brilliant, engaging and insightful.

But to me it only really works with that kind of restaurant and cuisine. I just don't find the more rustic food and cooks they focus on now really worth spending time dissecting, which is probably why they now pad it out with life stories when they used to shine a light almost exclusively on the food with the chef's journey being complimentary to this."
Chefs Table: BBQ,I found the fried chicken episode the worst - very cringy and overbearing especially if you aren't American.
Chefs Table: BBQ,I've seen it on there but I haven't checked it out yet. Will do for sure though.
Chefs Table: BBQ,I have seen that one actually. It's a really good film.
Chefs Table: BBQ,"This is my favorite docu-series on Netflix, can't wait to watch it

Wish it was more than a 4 episode season though"
Chefs Table: BBQ,"Pretty amazing parody of chef's table 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vcLzu5_Yb8"
Chefs Table: BBQ,I love this series. Super excited for this.
Chefs Table: BBQ,I can’t sleep and this gives me joy 
Chefs Table: BBQ,"The first series and in fact the first episode is still the best.

There are a lot of pretentious chefs on the later episodes."
Chefs Table: BBQ,"The shots look amazing, but take it down a notch with pretentiousness please, you are making food not saving the world."
Chefs Table: BBQ,"Alright, I've had this on my watch list for a while now. I'm a big fan of Parts Unknown/No Reservations. I kinda watched the first episode, but had to go to work and never went back. Is it a show along the lies of the two that I mentioned or is a bit different? "
Chefs Table: BBQ,"Oh thank goodness, this looks great. The Pastry ""season,"" if you'd call it that, was such a step down in quality I was worried it spoke to the future of the show, but it seems like that was likely an entirely different crew. This looks like more of what made the first three years so good. "
Chefs Table: BBQ,This show has gotten more and more pretentious with each season.  
Chefs Table: BBQ,"There are a few funny parodies, but [this one's](https://youtu.be/9kGtgBJKyZM) my personal favourite. "
Chefs Table: BBQ,"It's become a real turn off for me especially when the similar personality is so widespread. There's a lot to admire about their work and talent but for an entertainment series, it can sometimes come across pretty grating. Even on wholesome down to earth cooking shows it sticks out like a sore thumb. For example in Somebody Feed Phil, that chef who gets annoyed when people don't eat oysters properly, or Daniel Boulud insisting his sauce makes the mom's dish better. Or that guy in Ugly Delicious saying tacos are cultural appropriation. Chefs who are pretty down to earth or just as knowledgeable comes across pretty well on camera, like Narda Comedor or Christina Tosi and Carla and rest of the Bon Appetit editors. 

I think that's where the Great British Bake Off, Somebody Feed Phil and Nailed It gets their appeal. It's refreshing to see people who just enioys cooking and eating and just there for the fun of it. "
Chefs Table: BBQ,Not really. Parts Unknown is more about the culture. Chef Table is really about the chef and the food. 
Chefs Table: BBQ,The biggest similarity is that both shows revolve around food in some way or another - Bourdain looks at food in the context of a city whereas Chef's Table looks at food in the context of a chef.  Chef's Table is definitely more theatrical in comparison.
Chefs Table: BBQ,"This series is basically a documentary of the life of the chef, their food, and what they love about their art. Parts unknown is more about the people and the culture around cuisine, not necessarily about the chef. "
Chefs Table: BBQ,What!? The pastry season was amazing. Jordi Roca’s episode was one of the best of the entire series. I don’t think the quality dropped at all. Every episode was shot beautifully. I think it fits in with every other season. 
Chefs Table: BBQ,"I've never seen that one, but it is so dead on. 

My favorite, hands down, will always and forever be this one with the great Fred Armisen. https://www.eater.com/2017/2/28/14765040/portlandia-chefs-table

Sorry for the formatting, etc!"
Chefs Table: BBQ,"To each their own. I found the visual flair to be lacking, and I've heard similar things from other viewers, though it's far from categorical. Felt like it was put together more quickly while they were working on the next ""real"" season."
Chefs Table: BBQ,Chef's Table is the shiitttttt. So glad there's finally going to be more and for pastries! Sucks that it's only 4 episodes but it will be a nice snack 
Chefs Table: BBQ,I wouldnt have thought they would do a  series on pastry. I wonder if they are going to follow the Michelin ranked restaurants. 
Chefs Table: BBQ,This made me smile! Chef’s Table is the best! 🙌🏼
Chefs Table: BBQ,"Really excited. 
Potentially unpopular opinion but I think Tosi's work tends to be cloyingly sweet and almost childish. That being said I'll watch the duck out of each episode happily. "
Chefs Table: BBQ,"God, I love Chef's Table.  Back when it was just the original six episodes I was sick and having a blah day full of boredom, I ended up scrolling through Netflix and my love of cooking shows made me decide to give it a go.  I ended up watching all six episodes that day.  There is just something so wonderful about the way this show is presented, like a mini-biography that's just beautifully shot. 

I can not wait for this instalment."
Chefs Table: BBQ,Chef's Table is one of the best food shows. 
Chefs Table: BBQ,"Man I hate this show. I like how Netflix also has the show ""Ugly Delicious"" with David Chang where they make fun of these types of food videos. "
Chefs Table: BBQ,"I love how each episode is a mini documentary, with a different story and each shot in a different style depending on the chef. It’s not some stale documentary. Great show. "
Chefs Table: BBQ,That's not really what ugly delicious is doing at all...
Chefs Table: BBQ,"It's PG-13 Dee and Kaitlin Olson put any doubts to rest on her ability-- she's a great comedic actress, and she can do her own show, no doubts. But she's basically just Dee in the show, and aint nothing wrong there"
Chefs Table: BBQ,Loved that show. Sad it got canceled.
Chefs Table: BBQ,Mickey's corruption of Alba is one of my favorite TV friendships. We deserved 5 more seasons.
Chefs Table: BBQ,"She pops up because she’s a drunk 🤣

It was such a funny premise and the cast was so great"
Chefs Table: BBQ,You rarely see a comedy cast hit it off right from the start like this one did.
Chefs Table: BBQ,I loved that show but I also have a celebrity crush on Kaitlin Olson. Really wish it were renewed. The comedy was expected but still raunchy and fun enough.
Chefs Table: BBQ,"We've never watched IASIP, but loved The Mick, in our house Caitlin is called The Mick, which spurs revelations like ""Hey the Mick is married to that Wrexham guy"" etc.."
Chefs Table: BBQ,"I enjoyed it, made me laugh a lot. Some really good physical comedy. 

I think it’s better than any of the other Sunny guys projects anyway"
Chefs Table: BBQ,"it was hilarious, jimmy was great on it and the cast dynamic got funnier as it went. glad we got two seasons at least"
Chefs Table: BBQ,"Great show, Sunny crew need to make more shows. I miss the days of pure asshole comedy."
Chefs Table: BBQ,Someone being gruesomely injured or killed in every episode was such a good gag
Chefs Table: BBQ,I love how the dude kept getting his ass kicked.
Chefs Table: BBQ,That was a great show.  Surprising amount of character growth for a one camera comedy also.
Chefs Table: BBQ,Single Drunk Female is like a spin off
Chefs Table: BBQ,"The kid licking the Benihana table

Chef kiss."
Chefs Table: BBQ,One of my favorite shows. Such a good cast playing trashy people with a mixture of physical comedy. I really wish we got a season three.
Chefs Table: BBQ,"it was fine, worth watching once with some burst out laughing parts"
Chefs Table: BBQ,The casting on that show was so good. Red haired kid was such a funny actor.
Chefs Table: BBQ,Fucking phenomenal
Chefs Table: BBQ,"I hated every second that i watched the mick. Unfortunately, i hadn't seen its always sunny yet and because i didn't enjoy the mick its always sunny is now like ruined for me :(. I think that's an unpopular opinion on the mick but to each their own."
Chefs Table: BBQ,If you want to see a show where she does something different check out Flipped with her and Will Forte.  Sadly there's only one short season.
Chefs Table: BBQ,"Between mick, ap bio and mythic quest it felt like a pantheon of bottle episodes titled ""the gang hustles other tv shows"". Sure there's some differences, esp with the depth of mac's apple character...but bio and Mick were just the same lovable scumbags. I hope they reference the other shows in ASIP offhandedly"
Chefs Table: BBQ,I highly recommend watching r/IASIP!
Bookmarks,"Things can change, but for now, Toonami is safe from Zaslav:

>Representatives at WBD have confirmed that there are no plans or any desire to axe the block within the company. Likewise, the company has confirmed that the block is still looking forward to continuing its slate of original anime projects, starting in early October with its horror anime miniseries, Housing Complex C. [adult swim]’s original Toonami projects represent an overall shift in the company to combine its existing practice of dubbing acquired anime (mostly shonen) with a slate of more exclusively-broadcast anime and anime-adjacent content."
Bookmarks,Honestly surprised. Toonami feels like it's been stripped of so much ever since Funimation got merged into Crunchyroll
Bookmarks,"The picture and the start of the headline nearly gave me a heart attack. We gotta start putting the important words at the start.

Safe: Toonami Not Cut by Discovery

Alive: Elton John Celebrates Birthday at 75"
Bookmarks,"Thank God. Now let's just hope they don't get rid of more Adult Swim shows and keep on series like ""How to with John Wilson"" and ""The Rehearsal"""
Bookmarks,"Ok, but what about Primal? Please tell me Primal is safe!"
Bookmarks,"I also looked it up and according to the people working on ""My Adventures with Superman, the show hasn't been canceled. It's still been greenlit for two seasons and is still set to air on Cartoon Network and the CN app."
Bookmarks,Toonami changed my fucking life. Cowboy bebop premier was at 3am and I watched every episode! I learned cartoons don't have to be for children. We can take it seriously without sacrificing story and plot. And music can compliment an anime so well it brought me to tears when combined with Ed leaving the crew. Its beautiful
Bookmarks,So does this mean the venture bro movie has hope?
Bookmarks,Thank goodness
Bookmarks,Bring back Final Space
Bookmarks,I don't mean to be a boomer but kids today literally don't know how important Toonami is/was. The modern anime industry in the US owes EVERYTHING to this block.
Bookmarks,"Honestly with the network the way it is I would almost say Toonami is better off being a daily prime time block again.

Large portions of its anime selection were already written for young boys and even before this Cartoon Networks actual selection of content was kind of limited. On top of that theres a lot of stuff being produced in or for french or canadian audiences here and there they could probably grab the rights to cheaply to fill out time as a daily block. Even if you had to round it all out WB has already made like 50 gorillion DC hero movies that the studio just has lying around.

The time and the content is there and the networks got a big toonami shaped hole thats honestly been there for almost the whole time they removed it."
Bookmarks,"A legitimate concern as this whole purchase has been “if it ain’t broke, break it for no reason”, but glad it won’t be fucked with for now. Adult Swim and Toonami are in a good place right now. Toonami has some very interesting collaborations with Crunchyroll and anime studios coming up. Just let them do their thing."
Bookmarks,Why are we allowing these giant mergers that benefit nobody but the ceos?
Bookmarks,All because of a single [nerdy rap song](https://youtu.be/XlbbLFgiVQk).
Bookmarks,Thank god. Now I need HBO Max to implement a live Toonami channel that I can just put on in the background.
Bookmarks,It better be. Uzumaki is coming soon and if they axed it i'll be very upset.
Bookmarks,hopefully. It'll be sad to see TOM disappear again.
Bookmarks,"While I’m relieved to hear that, I’m a little surprised that this is safe while so many other great projects are getting axed."
Bookmarks,Wouldn't want to prematurely alarm the investors
Bookmarks,"I call bullshit. They’re already cutting adult swim, which has more notoriety. Fuck this merger"
Bookmarks,For now… Why should anyone trust these clowns the way they’ve been gutting content with a machete?
Bookmarks,3 words: fans with pitchforks!
Bookmarks,It’s safe until they decide it’s not profitable enough.
Bookmarks,All I need is that venture brothers movie that’s all I need
Bookmarks,Bring back Joe Pera Please!
Bookmarks,"As long as Primal is safe, I’ll be okay."
Bookmarks,Yeah they're in space can't touch em there
Bookmarks,Still sucks that the same couldn't happen for other cartoon network IPs
Bookmarks,"I about had a heart attack reading this

Don't scare me like that. Venture bros was bad enough"
Bookmarks,They know who their core audience is lol.  hopefully this won't change.
Bookmarks,Last time I watched toonami they were using the same 15 year old animations. It costs them nothing to maintain it other than the rights to the shows.
Bookmarks,\*the shell of a husk that once was Toonami
Bookmarks,"Toonami will ALWAYS have a special place in my heart but what the hell is the point of it in 2022?

Nobody is going to stay up until 3AM to watch a single episode of Inuyasha anymore"
Bookmarks,Sure thing WB. This is like a domestic abuser saying they'll never hurt you again.
Bookmarks,Which means its probably not.
Bookmarks,Primal looks cool as fuck. I watched one episode and didn't get into it. Is it worth sticking with?
Bookmarks,"Everything they have cancelled has been worthless trash with a few 1000 fans, but they all happen to be on Twitter / Reddit"
Bookmarks,"""Pray I do alter the deal further"" feeling. Safe... for now."
Bookmarks,I haven’t even watched Toonami in the last few years but this still gives a breath of fresh air.  Nothing like the nostalgia overdose of seeing the revival for the first time.
Bookmarks,I honestly wouldn’t believe them.
Bookmarks,[deleted]
Bookmarks,"Read this as ""Toonami for sale"" initially and panicked"
Bookmarks,"Good news, but their word to GameRant of all outlets is worth literally nothing."
Bookmarks,It lives!
Bookmarks,How much are they asking?
Bookmarks,For now......
Bookmarks,Of course it's cheaper to license Anime than produce the stoner comedies / After effects animation the block is known for.  If it saves the company money plus generates ratings it'll be safe.
Bookmarks,Uzumaki better be goddamn safe or we riot
Bookmarks,It’s ok folks. Put down the pitchforks.
Bookmarks,When is this merger happening?
Bookmarks,Okay cool but cancel the Venture Bros movie then you’re dealing with a lot of henchmen
Bookmarks,"Let's start a Tontine, month and year only. Whoever correctly guesses the month/year that Toonami becomes crab trucker storage island gets 1 reddit Karma because I personally won't upvote any comments until we have a winner. 

I'll start. And to show I have more integrity than Zaslav I will down vote my own comment to make this an even playing field.

January 2024."
Bookmarks,"Bring back dubbed Space Dandy, you c-nts!!!  I miss that show."
Bookmarks,Everyone liked that.
Bookmarks,"With my luck, Toonami would announce airing the second season of Demon Slayer, then Discovery would axe Toonami. I can’t afford 17 different streaming platforms, so I’m waiting on Cartoon Network/Toonami for new anime."
Bookmarks,"I’ll think Warner Bros. Or Discovery is competent when they are actually able to mirror or surpass the success of the MCU.

Or maybe I should cut them some slack. It’s not like they have 2 of the most recognized comic characters in history and the world right? 🙄"
Bookmarks,"Toonami means so much to so many.  I sometimes put the old promos up on YouTube and play them for background noise.  I loved how TOM always interacted with the audience, showed the artwork that was sent in, and had a message for some of the younger viewers.   I don’t know if there’s another show block that does anything similar, but getting rid of Toonami would be a horrible decision.  We already went through it once."
Bookmarks,They'll keep the anime because all they really have to do is dub 20 year Japanese stuff.  It costs them almost nothing.  Fits right in with all of Discovery's trash programming.
Bookmarks,If they shut down Toonami what the fuck are they gonna do about the giant spaceship Tom is on?
Bookmarks,Good fucking news man. Nobody can live without Toonami
Bookmarks,"If they cut Toonami, or adult swim, an entire few generations will riot, and tar and feather Zaslav."
Bookmarks,Does anyone have a comprehensive list of everything that IS getting axed at HBOMax?
Bookmarks,Where can I watch toonami to boost those numbers! Don’t let the child hood die!
Bookmarks,"Man this shit is nostalgic.  I remember being a kid going to sleep overs and trying to stay up all night.  You see that little robot/astronaut dude walk on screen and would get hyped as Fuck. 

Good times"
Bookmarks,Assumed I was on the Toonami sub 😂
Bookmarks,Not to be funny or disrespectful to the institution that Toonami is. But honestly speaking how many people actually still watch Toonami.
Bookmarks,"Random claim to adjacent fame: when I bought my first home (a condo), we had a neighbor next to us that wasn’t really there when we moved in. Sometime in the first month living there, I got a knock at the door, and the guy introduced himself as my neighbor and he was gonna be renting his place out and wanted to know if I wanted a few pieces of his furniture he needed to clear out. Turns out the guy was one of the co-creators of Toonami. Really chill guy and I still have at least the IKEA display case he gave me. I remember he had a ton of cool anime figures and statues, but hadn’t really lived there for a while."
Bookmarks,Sheeeesh if this isn’t some good news idk what is
Bookmarks,Tom for multi verses
Bookmarks,Tom isn’t dying again?
Bookmarks,Isn’t toonami on what was already adult swim’s anime block?
Bookmarks,IT FUCKING BETTER BE!!!
Bookmarks,Is toonami even relevant anymore? It's adult swim I'm worried about.
Bookmarks,"Toonami's been putting in the work since it came back. 

That brief era where they had Samurai Jack season 5 > Dragon Ball Super > Jojo > Hunter x Hunter back to back was unmatched

Hope they can match that hype again someday"
Bookmarks,"Not restructuring, more like fucking!"
Bookmarks,Until some of those shows get queer protagonists
Bookmarks,"Ok, now bring back Ballmasterz."
Bookmarks,"Man I just wanna see the batgirl movie, don’t even care if it’s bad at this point"
Bookmarks,Safe but they will shift to reality cartoons.
Bookmarks,The question is who benefits from “ToysRUs”ing Warner bros?
Bookmarks,"Lol man, content creation for studios is in such a bad fucking spot right now. The monopolies continue to absorb more and more"
Bookmarks,Fuck you discovery
Bookmarks,"Ok, so it’s safe because all they’re paying for is the dubs. Still a bad sign for original content at the network."
Bookmarks,"> Housing Complex C

*Housing Complex B*, the spinoff, is about all the residents around Complex C hearing about the stuff that goes on there and subsequently bugging the HOA about it."
Bookmarks,"Of course, representatives at WBD still would have confirmed that *Batgirl* was safe just days before it was scraped completely. Like you said, things can change."
Bookmarks,"I don't really watch toonami anymore, but adult swim, toonami, and WB kids were my sources of anime and some adult animated series, I wasn't sheltered, i was allowed to watch anything on tv, and wasn't stopped from watching rated R films when my dad had them on. I watched the predator movie. We might be sheltering kids a little too much these days."
Bookmarks,What's on Toonami these days? Do they even do original content?
Bookmarks,"Dude, it blows my mind seeing how big Crunchyroll became.  Like, I remember when it was *the* place for streaming free fandubs online.  Before there were any subscriptions, partnerships, or legal streams of anything.  I remember it as just a nifty little (albeit clunky at times) place for anime that was convenient enough that I stopped having to torrent individual episodes or season batches.

Now I'm reading sentences like ""Funimation got merged into Crunchyroll.""

Man, time flies."
Bookmarks,"More like ""absorbed"". It doesn't feel the same anymore."
Bookmarks,"It's the titles that explain the person and their achievements that do it.

""Elton John, singer pianist and song writer, commonly known for their hit song Rocket Man, has just celebrated their 75th Birthday!"""
Bookmarks,"These shows are under HBO, not HBO Max. There have yet to be any unexpected cancellations at HBO, and The Rehearsal was renewed despite a pretty potentially controversial final episode. The fact that people blend these HBO shows together with the HBO Max shows that are getting cut is sort of the heart of the problem."
Bookmarks,"The Rehearsal got renewed last week.  Zaslav is all in on things that cost little and gain subscribers which means ""reality"" programming and semi-scripted/unscripted comedies are likely safe if they generate or retain enough subscribers."
Bookmarks,"They cancelled Joe Pera Talks With You already, what kind of emotionless robot does that?"
Bookmarks,"RIP Joe Pera Talks With You, though. I really wish that show could get another season"
Bookmarks,The Rehearsal is better than any adult swim original series but the Tim and Eric universe stuff and Venture Bros. Honorable mention to The Eric Andre Show.
Bookmarks,Isn’t HBO unaffected by all of this? I thought it was just HBO Max that WB had any say in
Bookmarks,really bummed they removed Close Enough tbh
Bookmarks,The minute they axe Rick and Morty is the minute you start seeing riots outside their company headquarters.
Bookmarks,I'm worried about the Venture Brothers movie.
Felipe Esparza: Bad Decisions,"I'd like to reiterate, fuck Caillou."
Felipe Esparza: Bad Decisions,here's a [good read on Total Drama Island](https://www.reddit.com/r/HobbyDrama/comments/uptttz/animation_the_tragedy_of_total_drama_reunion_how/) from the r/HobbyDrama subreddit
Felipe Esparza: Bad Decisions,This was a great read.
Felipe Esparza: Bad Decisions,"I was there for the silver age. 

I really liked Delilah and Julius. 

And one I didn't see mentioned later on was Detentionaire. Came in 2011-2015 and was pretty good."
Felipe Esparza: Bad Decisions,"That was quite the word vomit, and I remember Teletoon fondly as a kid watching it on weekends during sleepovers at friends places. How are you going to write all that and not mention some greats like:

-	Roughnecks (Animated Starship Troopers)
-	The Oblongs
-	Undergrads
-	Mission Hill
-	The Critic
-	Tripping the Rift

And some weirder ones like Home Movies, Quads!, and god knows what else I can’t quite remember. I do recall Cybersix being a little over my head as a kid though and thought the main character was actually a dude for awhile lol.

Edit - I also rewatched the entirety of Roughnecks recently and it actually holds up pretty damn well. The voice acting is done well, and even though the CGI is from that era, it was really well done. I had never seen it all the way through when I was younger due to missing episodes and their infamously bad release schedule, but it was well worth the time to watch. The last season got cut short and it could have ended more cleanly, but I still enjoyed it thoroughly even after all these years."
Felipe Esparza: Bad Decisions,"I remember watching Undergrads and Clone high on Teletoon, you mentioned so many shows I totally forgot about....What a loss, but it was time."
Felipe Esparza: Bad Decisions,Teletoon was such a big part of my childhood. I used to watch scooby doo every day after school.
Felipe Esparza: Bad Decisions,Neds newt was the shit. You missed Dragon Ball
Felipe Esparza: Bad Decisions,"Omg I forgot about Megababies. The theme song immediately started playing in my head. I LOVED Braceface and For Better Or For Worse! Ugh I grew up on Teletoon, from the mid/late nineties till about 2004. This post was so nostalgic."
Felipe Esparza: Bad Decisions,"This post was a huge nostalgia trip for myself. Just thinking back there are so many shows that I enjoyed that actually were Teletoon originals and I just didn't realize it - it's kind of amazing! Teletoon circa 2005 through 2009 was my favourite period, mostly because of all the cool action-adventure shows that premiered in that time. I loved watching Chaotic, Bakugan, Spider Riders, Atomic Betty, and Skyland. I did also enjoy 6teen, the first season of Total Drama Island, and Johnny Test, but I never watched them consistently. From their earlier blocks, I will always have a soft spot for The Tofus, What About Mimi, What's with Andy (though admittedly I mostly watched the Romanian dub for this), Rescue Heroes, Maggie and the Ferocious Beast, The Kids from Room 402 (mostly the Romanian dub again)...and the theme song from Flying Rhino Junior High will still occasionally get stuck in my head :P 

I just hope that all these shows will be made more accessible for more folks to enjoy in future and not get put into an inconspicuous vault/removed from streaming without warning."
Felipe Esparza: Bad Decisions,I just bought the entire Redwall book series. 20+ books. Hoping it gets another shot at the screen because it's prime for adaptation imo
Felipe Esparza: Bad Decisions,"I grew up in Quebec and teletoon was my childhood. I remember it had the best animated series out there even before series that had continuity(not episodic) was a thing. Redwall, silvering and toad patrol were amazing."
Felipe Esparza: Bad Decisions,"My parents didnt want to get more than the basic tv package, we didnt have the Teletoon channels, much to my chagrin.

Channel 44 for us, I think that was the french version.

We had to make do with VrakTv (25) and YTV (70?)."
Felipe Esparza: Bad Decisions,Anyone remember Untalkative Bunny? That's the first thing that comes to mind when I think of Teletoon
Felipe Esparza: Bad Decisions,"Man I thought I was the only one who remembered Mega Babies.

Also shout out to weeknights from 8-9pm when The Bugs Bunny and Tweety Show was on."
Felipe Esparza: Bad Decisions,Delta state was the shit!
Felipe Esparza: Bad Decisions,"Don't forget Clone High! The late night era with Undergrads, Oblongs, Mission hill and Clone High was the best."
Felipe Esparza: Bad Decisions,Dragon Ball was on YTV
Felipe Esparza: Bad Decisions,I knew I was forgetting one. Clone High was amazing.
Felipe Esparza: Bad Decisions,It was on both actually
Felipe Esparza: Bad Decisions,I seem to remember Sons of Butcher playing in that era with those shows but that might’ve been YTV
Felipe Esparza: Bad Decisions,"Ah, I see now. They aired 13 episodes in 1997. So yeah you're *technically* correct, but I think most Canadian kids who grew up in that era would remember it as a YTV show."
Felipe Esparza: Bad Decisions,Saw that too and I swear they had more than 14 episodes. It was a long time ago so who knows
Felipe Esparza: Bad Decisions,Some shows I try and recognise are written well but the subject matter doesn't appeal to me so I stop watching. Other shows that should appeal to me are poorly written in both plot and dialogue and are just genuinely bad. I honestly think good writers are in short supply now that every streaming service is releasing new content every other week.
Felipe Esparza: Bad Decisions,"While I definitely believe that some folks use *""bad writing""* as code for *""I just didn't like it""* there are plenty of other people who genuinely just use it as a shorthand for *""this work had multiple flaws that all combined to create an incredibly sloppy and disappointing narrative""*

For example, most folk will simply say that the final seasons of *Game Of Thrones* were *""badly written""* rather than listing out every single individual flaw with characterization/worldbuilding/plot beats/conflict resolution/etc. It's just faster to use shorthand than to type out an entire essay"
Felipe Esparza: Bad Decisions,"Ironically, unlike writers, not everyone has the knowledge or vocabulary to put their feelings into words.

E.g. Season 7 of GoT just made me really sad. It was like all my favourite characters had dimentia. They were walking, shambling husks of their old selves. The lights were on, but no-one was home. 

It took a while for me to find people on Youtube and Reddit that felt the same way, and could articulate those thoughts better than I could."
Felipe Esparza: Bad Decisions,"I always ask for an example.  If all they can say still is it's just bad I assume they fall into this category. But if they can actually discuss things like structure, character arcs, etc, and why they consider them bad (and not just my fan theory wasn't true) then I do think they are using it correctly"
Felipe Esparza: Bad Decisions,"Similarly, it sometimes seems that not knowing the obvious direction of a story leads to some 'this doesn't make sense/bad writing' type comments instead of just waiting to see what happens, cause they haven't told you the full story immediately"
Felipe Esparza: Bad Decisions,Definitely a vague blanket term some people use when they don't really know what they're talking about
Felipe Esparza: Bad Decisions,"I'm normally more specific in my criticisms than complaining about a vague ""bad writing"", but when I do it's usually both poor dialogue and storytelling

""Willow"" is an excellent example of bad writing. It has really, really bad dialogue like the line ""he's immortal bitch!"" coming from the big bad and delivered as poor as the line is. 

Willow also has inconsistent character actions that resemble a first draft by different writers per episode (like Willow confesses he's a charlatan in episode 5 but then continues on as a magic master. I don't think it's self doubt, because he doesn't really have a character arc, and never really struggles with that outside of that scene. This is a minor example but easy to explain).

Willow also has poor dialogue pacing, like when Kit asks Boorman about her father in episode 2, he drops an info bomb on her, and she doesn't bother to follow up on it until hours or possibly days later. It's very strange.

stuff like that is what I'm referring too when I say ""bad writing"""
Felipe Esparza: Bad Decisions,"> Edit: some numpty just reported me for suicide risk. Lmao

Yeah i had that 'reach out' message too once and was like... what a waste that is.

> I feel like people are using the phrase “bad writing” about shows they don’t like without going into detail about what it is that makes a show bad.

It's true that criticism has sort of regressed a bit online - a lot of videos  talking about a movie or TV show literally walk through all of the plot points rather than go into an essay-like talk about what they liked and didn't like about it, citing examples. Just shitting on every scene and calling it bad writing. ""Disparu"" on Youtube (a British man with very greasy hair and unsettling body language) is an example.

The problem is that noone seems to listen when you give detailed reasons why something is broken. They want a gut reaction, and ""bad writing"" can be used for one person to try to force an opinion, because it basically says ""this is terrible. if you like it, you are stupid because you fail to recognize it's terrible.""

I like a lot of stuff with 'bad writing'."
Felipe Esparza: Bad Decisions,"Yeah.  Without clarification its a fundamentally meaningless statement.  

>It’s like the phrase is an objective statement about the quality of the show rather than just saying “I don’t like it”/“It’s not for me”

This is also super common.  For some reason people have to let you know that not only do they not like something, but also its objectively bad, so if you liked it, obviously there is something wrong with you."
Felipe Esparza: Bad Decisions,"It often is; and much like someone shrieking that X game, show, or film is *objectively* bad, they're often using the term to just paper over their own personal gripes but will almost never actually expand on it unless you really press them and near without fail it just comes back to ""I didn't like it"" rather than there being some great, deep, flaw that broke it."
Felipe Esparza: Bad Decisions,"Writing is easy to criticize for various reasons:

1. Most television shows are run by writer showrunners. Many people are aware of this. When you want to complain about a show, the easiest target is the writing since that's who is in charge.
2. There are lots of books and workshops about ""how to write"" for Hollywood scripts. This makes it easier for people to see writing as simply ""following a series of rules,"" and to criticize shows and movies for failing to follow these rules.
3. A lot of the shows people are critical of are based on pre-existing material (books, games, movies). Criticism of 'the writing' is easy, then, since all you have to do is compare two pre-existing things and claim the older one is better.

&#x200B;

Also stuff about 'writing' here on reddit gets a bit distorted because of the taste of the userbase. Look at threads about 'books you'd like to see adapted into movies/television shows' and you will find almost no literary fiction there, it's always just paperback trash and sci-fi/fantasy stuff. The amount of great writing that the average person here is exposed to is practically zero."
Felipe Esparza: Bad Decisions,"I suppose you could look at it from the perspective that by saying that a show has bad writing you're removing responsibility for the end performance from the actor to the writer. A shitty actor can definitely fuck up great lines, but the inverse is also true, a great actor can only do so much with shitty dialogue. So if you're saying that a show has bad writing, you're not blaming the actors, you're blaming the writers, and by extension a lot of the rest of the crew (director, producers) who allowed shitty writing to make it to the screen. The problem exists behind the camera, and not in front of the camera."
Felipe Esparza: Bad Decisions,"> I feel like people are using the phrase “bad writing” about shows they don’t like without going into detail about what it is that makes a show bad. Is it the dialogue? Characterisations? Worldbuilding? character decisions? The plot or the ending? The climax? 

Tbh, I've always felt that ""bad writing"" was an ambiguous statement without a bit of further clarification. Reason being, it can refer to any of those aspects you've listed, or a combination thereof.

""Bad writing"" can refer to the language or prose itself. In audivisual media like films and TV shows, this would tend to manifest as noticeably poor or unrealistic dialogue -- often leading into poor characterization as a result.

It can also refer more to aspects related to narrative structure and/or worldbuilding -- lack of internal logical consistency, overuse of deus ex machina cop-outs, a weak third act that kind of unravels with a whimper, that kind of thing.

While I can't think of any works off the top of my head that are ""well written"" in terms of their prose or use of language, but ""badly written"" in terms of narrative structure, worldbuilding, etc., I'd imagine they might exist. But they'd be far less common than works that are ""poorly written"" in both respects.

> It’s like the phrase is an objective statement about the quality of the show rather than just saying “I don’t like it”/“It’s not for me”. What are your thoughts?

Yeah, I'd honestly guess that most people aren't really all that adept of removing themselves and their tastes from the equation when evaluating a work. 

That is, they're not necessarily going to be like, ""Well, this isn't to *my* taste, but it's a very tight and well-crafted narrative, I could see someone else who's into that genre would love it.""

As an example, I watched the premiere of TLOU when it dropped. I wasn't into it personally, but it's a really well-executed show with a lot of potential. 

I'm just not a fan of either zombie fiction, or general post-apocalyptic fiction. The genre doesn't do it for me. But that doesn't mean it's not a *fantastic* piece of television! It's just ""not for me.""

That's more nuance than you can expect from most people on massive major subreddits like /r/television and the like. 

But tbh, I feel like you can kind of read between the lines and glean whether someone criticizing a show for ""bad writing"" is actually referring to elements that would fall under the ""writing"" umbrella, or whether they just didn't like something subjectively but feel the need to frame that objectively for whatever reason."
Felipe Esparza: Bad Decisions,"I agree with you, OP. That's not to say there is no bad writing out there, I just think it's a catch-all term used by people who don't have any greater insight, or can't be bothered to give better reasoning. It's lazy. 
  
Each show has a writers' room packed with people working hard to come up with a coherent plot. Sometimes they fuck it up, but the insinuation from armchair critics that the writers don't care or haven't thought through their choices grates with me. They almost certainly have, and it's worth identifying what the intention was as much as it is criticising the outcome.
  
But it's just easy to say ""well that was poorly written""."
Felipe Esparza: Bad Decisions,No. Some shows are just poorly written.
Felipe Esparza: Bad Decisions,Pretty much yeah.
Felipe Esparza: Bad Decisions,"A good chunk of any review gets you branded as one thing or another, leading to personnal attacks and bans. So ""bad writing"" will have to do."
Felipe Esparza: Bad Decisions,"Unfortunately, the “I don’t like this and neither should anyone else” position frequently gets stuffed into a variety of “critical” terms anymore (and then defended as “genuine critique”). I see it in tv, video game, book, movie, etc subs. 
Just tell us you didn’t like it. Or, better yet, don’t? 
Maybe it’s just me, but I don’t follow the subs of things I love just so I can see people bash it all day long, and I’ve left subs as a result. 

I think it’s a refusal to self-reflect. If something is giving you that strong of a reaction, then there’s a deeper reason why, whether you admit it or not. But it always gets boiled down into, “this is bad because X” and it’s kind of exhausting."
Felipe Esparza: Bad Decisions,"yeah, same has been bugging me when people do it the opposite way. go into 'what are you watching' threads and you read these reviews of like ""oh i love it the direction, the cinematography, the acting"". i mean that basically tells you nothing. 

it's like reading a review of your favorite restaurant and they will say 'my favorite was the taste of the food'"
Felipe Esparza: Bad Decisions,"""Is it the dialogue? Characterisations? Worldbuilding? character decisions? The plot or the ending? The climax?""

One problem is that each of these is potentially its own ""bad writing."" You can't fully demonstrate any of  the qualities without posting clips from the (usually new) show to demonstrate.

It's an open access forum with 16 million subscribed accounts, so any value from poster to reader accrues more or less randomly. Pretty much any review might as well be reduced to ""thumbs up/thumbs down."""
Felipe Esparza: Bad Decisions,"It's been that way forever, largely due to people with extreme poor media literacy wanting to sound like they know what they're talking about. It's definitely a red flag to not take what they're saying too seriously."
Felipe Esparza: Bad Decisions,"Everyone is a fucking critic. They watch other reviewers and then go spewing nonsense around to seem smart. When it really boils down too, I didn't like this much so it must be bad."
Felipe Esparza: Bad Decisions,"Bad writing, while a legitimate concern, is mistaken for ""I don't like this"" on a great many occasions. It's hard to call something bad writing when you have little understanding of it. 

Walking Dead? Bad writing/production/side actors 

Midnight Mass? Slowburn horror."
Felipe Esparza: Bad Decisions,"One of the most frequent issues with bad writing is its not logical or it betrays how the world and character has been established to work. 

If you are constantly screaming at the tv for the character acting like idiots and doing things no human would ever do then that is bad writing."
Felipe Esparza: Bad Decisions,"I don't think so. There is objectively good writing.

Good dialogue:

* feels naturals
* flows well
* is fun
* establishes multiple things
* is unique to each character"
Felipe Esparza: Bad Decisions,"you're assuming way too much, OP. First of all, if I don't like something I don't try to convince anybody to feel the same, one man's pleasure is another one's poison, maybe they will enjoy what I loathe and vice versa. Secondly, perhaps there are days where people don't feel the need to write technical essays about the fallacies in the writing of X thing, but prefer to make their point quick and fast. And third, yes, opinions are obviously subjective, but as it happens in every job ever invented including writing there are various degrees of competency and rules that have to be considered objectively"
Felipe Esparza: Bad Decisions,"It really has. There’s a shitload of facets to what makes writing good - themes, structure, pacing, attention to detail, etc - but writing is very much an art form, and breaking some rules in art is very much the point. Unfortunately, media literacy is a dying skill, so you often see the one-two punch of “bad writing” + “plot holes” when discussing literally any story online."
Felipe Esparza: Bad Decisions,[deleted]
Felipe Esparza: Bad Decisions,"To me at least, good writing is nuanced and involves a story that challenges people's core beliefs in an entertaining manner.

The success of Twilight etc seems like a good example of how a lot of people enjoy bad writing where you can just turn your brain off and not pay too much attention."
Felipe Esparza: Bad Decisions,"No, because people can usually justify why they didn’t like something. 

I personally think the better question would be if unlikable characters equals bad writing."
Felipe Esparza: Bad Decisions,"It always has been. Same with ""bad acting"", ""Mcguffin"", ""guy goes here and does this"", going frame to frame criticizing things as well, or just boiling the plot down to the barest part of it and just pretending that's a valid criticism. 

Youtubers do it alot and people follow that."
Felipe Esparza: Bad Decisions,"I pretty much never take anyone seriously if they say ""bad writing"". Sometimes they use it to mean inconsistent characters (which can also mean ""character acted in a way I didn't expect""), corny dialogue (which can also mean ""everybody tells me to lighten up""), or poor acting (which has nothing to do with writing but that doesn't stop people). That doesn't mean there can't be nuances to this criticism, but summing it up with simply ""bad writing"" just feels incredibly short-sighted. I just have to ask what Youtuber they got their opinion from, because more often than not it's those amateur critics that boast about ""bad writing"" when it's something they don't like.

It also annoyingly implies that any apparent problem they subjectively find can be fixed by just doing the opposite. Like they're saying, ""If I was making the show, I would simply not have bad writing."" It's stupid."
Felipe Esparza: Bad Decisions,"Forcing a situation just for the sake of empty spectacle/manufactured drama/ whatever the writers angle was

Good writing&directing can make unforgettable episodes out of seemingly unimportant events

Felipe Esparza: Bad Decisions,"Sometimes yes, but not when discussing the 13th Doctor."
Felipe Esparza: Bad Decisions,"Cobra Kai is the best example of bad writing ruining a good show. Same actors, but the show descended into unwatchable telenovela."
Felipe Esparza: Bad Decisions,"It depends on the show. There could be a million reasons why someone doesn't like a show. Sometimes the plot falls flat, the characters can be unlikeable, etc.  If the show is poorly acted, then that can be really distracting from whatever is happening amongst the characters. 

I saw a similar post about this on another subreddit, but it touched upon how people don't really give a show enough time to make a fair assessment if they like it.  I feel like you have to give a show at LEAST an episode to see if you're likely to keep watching."
Felipe Esparza: Bad Decisions,"Bad writing is important to point out because you can have perfectly good actors and the writers can just make them do and say things that are stupid and it ruins the show. Game of Thrones had the same actors in the final seasons as it did in the early seasons but the show became completely terrible. Totally the writers.

Most shows just start off with shitty writing so it's harder to pick out because there's no benchmark good seasons to compare with. The Foundation series had barely one episode of decent writing before it jumped down the toilet. It can be that fast. Rings of power went to shit around the time galadriel learned about bouyancy. You blink and the series is suddenly shit."
Felipe Esparza: Bad Decisions,"I feel like this is what has been happening with The Handmaid's Tale. It has some issues sure, but people are saying it's badly written because the main character is making irrational decisions and the show is way too slow. I mean she's getting raped every month, oppressed like shit, tortured and a lot more. I doubt this would feel like time is going by or that you would be in any position to think clearly. June has too much plot armor? I could see this, but the criticisms above are just going against to what the show is."
Felipe Esparza: Bad Decisions,"The majority of people on the internet are not experts at the things that interest them.

Felipe Esparza: Bad Decisions,"Just ask them to be specific. If they can't do that, they aren't worth listening to."
Felipe Esparza: Bad Decisions,I do think it gets misused but I also think there is more bad writing in television than ever before lol.
Felipe Esparza: Bad Decisions,"I use bad writing for plot points I've seen a million times before.  No stories are technically new and they all share similar archetypes,  but if I can predict the next piece of dialogue or know the entire plot of your movie/show on the first 10 minutes then why keep watching?

The Magicians season 1 almost pulled me out like that.   Oh crappy romance between these two,  drama, blah blah.  And then whooooosh, nope, we're going on an adventure! And I loved it."
Felipe Esparza: Bad Decisions,"Yes. I see that a lot regarding Conservatives being scared to voice their true feelings regarding a show because something or someone they don’t like is in or on it? It’s the same thing with music people beating the word ""industry plant"" and ""payola"" using it regarding musicians they don’t like. They use the words as a cop out to hide their feelings.

But there are people who may actually not like the writing of a particular show."
Felipe Esparza: Bad Decisions,"I think ""bad writing"" has become shorthand for a large and varied amount of complaints that people just don't have a great vocabulary for how to voice. Sort of like how ""bad net code"" became a by word for a problem for something very real, but was in fact a large assortment of various problems people were having with video games. Sometimes ""bad cinematography"" gets used this way too.

It's not that the complaint is *wrong* -- it's just that in a general sense people aren't equipped to differentiate between, say, studio meddling in a story versus a writer indulging in something that the audience doesn't like, versus a well written but unsatisfying scene, versus a satisfying but jumbled and chaotic scene, just for a few examples.

All these things can fall under ""bad writing"" but what people mean are very different things.

To use the Game of Thrones example, there are tons of examples of perfectly well written scenes, or at least scenes written in line with previous ones that are beloved in the show, that exist in the last season that people hate because they feel out of character, or delivered poorly, or otherwise feel incorrect. Those scenes aren't written poorly themselves, but rather something has for one reason or another gone wrong in delivering the story and we colloquially refer to that as ""bad writing."""
Felipe Esparza: Bad Decisions,"That's incredibly lazy and dishonest at that. For one, the person making the claim should have some technical knowledge to begin with. 
If one doesn't know what's written and what's improvised for example. Also, if one doesn't or understand why those creative decisions are made, just generalizing story elements that are personally disliked as flaws is disingenuous. 

The phenomenon I see the most, is a misunderstanding of dramatic irony, and the fact that people really make mad decisions in real life, just like they make good ones.
It's easy then to misjudge a character in a story that's not privy to information the reader has or misunderstanding why they made the wrong decision in a particular scenario.

A flaw is an objective issue, being ""disappointed"" however is a subjective response. The former can be proven, the latter cannot. Labeling something a flaw, inherently implies that there's a way an element MUST be done and unless it's a technical aspect and said person criticizing said element is competent and experienced in how that element is supposed to be handled...

It's just "" I didn't like it"" dressed up as ""It was heavily flawed.

I'll leave you with this example :
(I notice people love to run with this tactic)

""Aw man, I thought they were gonna do A but they did B instead. It's a missed opportunity!""

So let's say I'm at a bus stop and a very attractive woman walks by and winks at me,
to an onlooker, it's a missed opportunity.
Yet they don't know what MY target is, so when the next woman walks up and I leave with her, they're baffled. Thing is, it's not a missed opportunity if I actively chose not to pursue that path. 

That's the crux of many who I see talking about ""bad writing"" & ""flaws"", never dawns on them that just because a writer didn't implement an idea, doesn't mean it never crossed their minds. More often than not, they considered it already and chose another way"
Felipe Esparza: Bad Decisions,">E.g. Season 7 of GoT just made me really sad. It was like all my favourite characters had dimentia. They were walking, shambling husks of their old selves.

That's ironically a really good description of bad writing."
Felipe Esparza: Bad Decisions,"Yeah, it was like a weird body horror where you could see the characters/actors portraying their internal tension with being flanderized so hard."
Felipe Esparza: Bad Decisions,"Which is why those such people have no justification to judge those writers. 
I can't build a car for shit, kind of automatically  eliminates my ability to tell a manufacturer how to build one, despite how many times I've seen or been in one lol

Felipe Esparza: Bad Decisions,"My favorite shorthand for ""I don't like but I  can't explain why"" is to say ""it looks like the CW"".

Felipe Esparza: Bad Decisions,"I try this method systematically and have a decent answer maybe 1 out of ten times.

Most of the time, it's either disappearance, personal attack, play the victim or the so classic ""it's just an opinion""."
Felipe Esparza: Bad Decisions,"Like the people who go see a 2nd part of a trilogy, knowing that going in and still coming out complaining ""it felt incomplete"""
Felipe Esparza: Bad Decisions,"Or they are lazy. It takes time to write a long paragraph or paragraphs pointing out the flaws. It's easier to write a sentence or two of, ""This show is bad. I don't know how anyone likes it."" And then leave it at that. 

If you go check out the comment history of most redditors who write the later type of posts, the majority of their posts are equally as short. The type of people who write long posts usually do it on their own personal tumblrs or try to get paid to write long posts on whatever website. Or they write it in a script and make a youtube video on it."
Felipe Esparza: Bad Decisions,Along with “great cinematography” when they mean “pretty images”
Felipe Esparza: Bad Decisions,"I don't really think it's that vauge.  There's like 3 or 4 main components the average viewer will differentiate.

It's easy to tell if you like the actors or not. And pretty easy to tell if the cinematography and lighting feels thought out or not.

If those two feel ok than direction and writing kind of get lumped into one pile when someone says they don't like the writing.

I'm fine with that.  I don't expect everyone to have a critics vocabulary and I get what they are saying personally."
Felipe Esparza: Bad Decisions,"Of course people want sci-fi & fantasy adaptations, those are full of things I'd want to see on TV. That doesn't mean I don't read other books, just that I don't think a tv adaptation is an exciting idea."
Felipe Esparza: Bad Decisions,"Most shows have diff actors, diff actors in the same storyline and the same scenes. So it's pretty easy to spot, the one actor who is fucking great lines, it's also easy to post the one actor who is carrying the show on his back, despite the bad writing or the bad acting.

Nowadays, shows tend to have a rotating roster of directors, it's also easier to spot the correlation between a good directed episode and his director."
Felipe Esparza: Bad Decisions,Unless that actor is Tim Curry

The thing I find bizarre about TLOU is how people are raving about the writing and storytelling. The opening scene with the scientists was a really clever way to introduce things, but honestly, everything that followed was pretty cliche and telegraphed. There wasn't anything exceptional about the writing itself."
Felipe Esparza: Bad Decisions,"Nah, OP is right. Sure there are poorly written shows, but people really just be throwing the phrase ""bad writing"" out there whenever they don't like something."
Felipe Esparza: Bad Decisions,"I'm looking at you, ending of Game of Thrones."
Felipe Esparza: Bad Decisions,"Yeah, The Witcher is particularly bad. It's like, why is this character doing this? Why am I seeing this scene? In the books during a particular scene, a character has complex and conflicting emotions about an action he's going to take that basically encapsulate his whole character for the series and in the show they just make it a joke."
Felipe Esparza: Bad Decisions,"Also to add: 

Expectations! They ruin your enjoyment! 
You not liking something because it didn’t live up to whatever impossible standard of expectation you had does not make it bad. 
I expect to enjoy things as often as I can. It’s the one expectation that doesn’t let me down. Perception is everything, my friends, and it so frequently deeply colors people’s “critical opinions.”"
Felipe Esparza: Bad Decisions,"> ""oh i love it the direction, the cinematography, the acting""

Something like Killing Eve in the later two seasons was that for me. I watched for Jodie Comer and Sandra Oh. The directing and production design was still top-notch. But the writing was shambolic by the end, absolutely shambolic. I don't regret watching it, because the performance of Comer in particular was so good, but I would heavily emphasize the fact the writing falls of a cliff and then starts digging a hole by the final few episodes."
Felipe Esparza: Bad Decisions,">into 'what are you watching' threads and you read these reviews of like ""oh i love it the direction, the cinematography, the acting"". i mean that basically tells you nothing. 

Well no I don't agree there. Apart from direction, vast amount of people would understand what good acting would mean so if the acting is good it can draw viewers in. So for example Claire Danes acting in homeland was often so powerful that it got recognised and praised and people wanted to see it as it wasn't exactly the average acting you get,it was a cut above the rest. She really brought that character to life and portrayed mental illness in ways that very few if any had done so competently before on screen.

Direction I will agree with you because many people wouldn't really get that term but I think alot of people would understand cinematography. It just means in simple terms  how well images are created on the scene and brings the story to life. It explains how visually impressive the show is  So for example lost had some great cinematography with them on the beautiful island. Or the cinematography in the film the blue lagoon often gets massive praise as well as the film the beach."
Felipe Esparza: Bad Decisions,"I mostly agree with your points about internal logic/rules, and betraying character arcs. While I see your point of people acting like idiots and that being annoying, I don’t think this is as much of an problem as the aforementioned ones. I don’t think it’s fair to think characters should be rational automatons who only make 100% smart decisions all the time. That would be boring and not really true to real life. This is especially the case when the characters are stressful and panic inducing situations like being chased by a killer in a horror movie. Humans are selfish messy emotional and flawed beings. Also seeing how the world reacted to the Covid-19 pandemic has lost my faith in humanity to do the rational thing for the greater good."
Felipe Esparza: Bad Decisions,"Most dialogue that people consider good doesn't feel natural at all. Deadwood, Sorkin shows, any comedy."
Felipe Esparza: Bad Decisions,"But the criteria you listed is subjective, some might not think that dialogue needs to be fun or establish multiple things to be considered good. I guess for something to be objectively considered good it must be universally liked by everyone, which for something as subjective as television is impossible. It would be like trying to find the most objectively good ice cream flavour. It’s entirely subjective."
Felipe Esparza: Bad Decisions,"I think the problem is when someone makes an objective declaration ""the writing was bad"" vs a subjective one ""I thought the writing was bad"". 

Because if I watched the same show and thought the writing was good or at least adequate, I'm gonna be annoyed at the first statement basically telling me I'm wrong without any explanation."
Felipe Esparza: Bad Decisions,">\>I’ve noticed in the kdrama fandom **“bad writing” often means “I am a teenager and I am upset that the main female lead didn’t end up with the male actor who I think is cuter than the other one.” It can also mean “I wanted a particular ending really badly and I ignored everything that indicated the ending would not be what I wanted and now I feel betrayed because I ignored the clear story signals.”**

&#x200B;

This, exactly this.

Not only in Kdrama, also in US drama fandom. The bonus part is the traditional accusation of racism against the writers, when it happens that the main female is WOC. Eventhough the writers room is significantly more diverse than the pop in the US and the authors of  the specific story are POC/WOC."

Couples Come Dine with Me,I haven't heard of this show but recently I've been getting into british tv on Netflix. You guys have some really good shows and I love the differences between the shows the US has remade. the UK Kitchen Nightmares is really good.

Couples Come Dine with Me,Monsters at Work too (note the thumbnail Disney Channel gave it) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpf8YnqfqGc
Couples Come Dine with Me,"This show slaps, I really hope they produce another season."
Couples Come Dine with Me,"Nobody:

Disney: hey how about our classic characters, but in Calart style?"
Couples Come Dine with Me,"I saw a few episodes. I love the old cartoons. The new abstract artwork is terrible. Will avoid watching this new show. My kids watch the old cartoons, they're much more fun in their opinion. Not all new things are better things."
Couples Come Dine with Me,Every network but Discovery/WB&HBO will probably push for this.
Couples Come Dine with Me,It's inevitable as viewership keeps falling. At some point it'll make sense to just air the streaming shows on network and cable TV to keep the people entertained who still don't give up the old ways.
Couples Come Dine with Me,I believe a second season is arriving sometime in 2023.
Couples Come Dine with Me,Netflix - DID I HEAR A NEW ORIGINAL SERIES???
Couples Come Dine with Me,Actually it's in the art style as Oogy and the Cockroaches and even made by the same people.
Couples Come Dine with Me,It's from the same animation studio behind Oogy and the Cockroaches. Which explains the familiar art style and the gibberish dialogue.
Couples Come Dine with Me,"They did it a couple years ago with The Flight Attendant on TBS, but now they probably won’t do that again"
Couples Come Dine with Me,I don't even know what you're talking about
Couples Come Dine with Me,"Those are all on HBO, which has a reputation for being pretty dark."
Couples Come Dine with Me,The only one of those I've seen is last of us.  Maybe it is just the majority of what you choose to consume.
Couples Come Dine with Me,"i think creatively, everyone is coming out of COVID, so everyone's material is dark.

the only uplifting show i'm currently watching (besides the recommended Ted Lasso) is Abbott Elementary.

Schmigadoon is coming out soon too, but that's very niche, idk if broadway is your thing.

I also like the company you keep. it has a very ""catch me if you can""/guy ritchie vibe!"
Couples Come Dine with Me,"It's just the shows you are choosing or what you define as popular.

Season 3 of Ted Lasso is starting tomorrow, so try that."
Couples Come Dine with Me,"I'm loving For all mankind, because I love the characters, but goddam I need to see something work out for them every once and a while"
Couples Come Dine with Me,"A few lighter alternatives -

Willow (so bad I liked it)

What We Do In The Shadows

The Righteous Gemstones"
Couples Come Dine with Me,Mandalorian is a positive vibes show going on right now
Couples Come Dine with Me,"don't watch 3 dramas, one after the other. Watch a comedy between them 

personally I always watch different genres."
Couples Come Dine with Me,"Might I suggest Paddington 2 as a palette cleanser once you finish The Last of Us?  


I'm not joking."
Couples Come Dine with Me,"I used to think people would watch depressing shows and then feel depressed. If they just watched happy shows they would be ok.

Then I realised that some people at least are looking for something in the world that echoes how they are feeling inside because they can't express it themselves and need to feel seen or understood. By watching those shows they can express it and hopefully get that feeling out a little bit.

Zombies etc often represent fear of death in popular media.. the feeling of lonliness in the show seems to reflect the lonliness of our modern society and a fear of being alone."
Couples Come Dine with Me,Watch you some Ted Lasso
Couples Come Dine with Me,Ghosts is fun and upbeat.
Couples Come Dine with Me,"Joe Pera talks with you is a beautiful show. It isn't so wholesome it feels fake, and isn't mean or edgy."
Couples Come Dine with Me,Theres other popular and less depressing shows coming out. Don't let reddit bias make you think its all depressing stuff.
Couples Come Dine with Me,"Mythic Quest is amazing. It’s on AppleTV. 

Peacemaker was over the top fun. You can stream that on HBO. 

I’d also recommend Great British Bake-off or something along those lines. Netflix has a lot of these shows which you can turn your brain off and just enjoy."
Couples Come Dine with Me,I noticed that a lot of the shows that have gained notoriety have been darker recently.
Couples Come Dine with Me,Good thing Ted Lasso is about to come back.
Couples Come Dine with Me,"There has definitely been a turn toward dark settings and dark characters the past decade or so in popular shows. Zombie and post apocalypse fiction is still going strong as ever despite just retreading the same ground.

The audience also seems really receptive to ""cold bad ass"" characters that are basically just violent sociopaths. I was watching Foundation and fans hated a scared teenager whose ""grandfather"" calls an abomination, too wimpy! Same with House Of The Dragon, fans respond to ""stone cold"" characters.

I realized if Breaking Bad came out today Walt and Jessie would probably be too wimpy for most audiences."
Couples Come Dine with Me,"Unfortunately that is the trend but I'd try out The Bear.  That wasn't  depressing and has a hopeful vibe throughout .  Perry mason just came back and while it has some dark aspect, I'd say it's pretty positive overall in that perry fights against corrupt power structures and defends the innocent, which is refreshing nowadays"
Couples Come Dine with Me,"I've not watched Wednesday but, I assume, it wasn't morbidly depressing and dark and that was one of the most watched shows in the world recently.

In other words it's just you dude. You can choose to watch popular shows that aren't dark and depressing."
Couples Come Dine with Me,"Well the last of us is adapted from a game that came out 10 years ago, so I don't think this is a recent development or anything."
Couples Come Dine with Me,"Another thing... so many suicides on shows. All types of killing yourself, like Tess, or Frank."
Couples Come Dine with Me,I think there's a tendency to equate grimdark with sophistication and quality and a lot of shows chase that.
Couples Come Dine with Me,You should watch station eleven.
Couples Come Dine with Me,"> That's why I love puss in boots and other shows like that

You're comparing prestige, career-defining HBO dramas with... children's cartoons?"
Couples Come Dine with Me,"Every time my husband and I finish one series and have to look for another, I find myself desperately seeking something light, charming and smart because I'm tired of the heaviness and the darkness. I seldom find it, though, so it'd be nice if Ted Lasso would announce a fucking start date for S03."
Couples Come Dine with Me,"Don't fall into reddit's ""prestige TV"" trap. It's perfectly fine to watch something lame that makes you feel happy.

If you want a drama that isn't super serious *You* is actually pretty great. It gets weird sometimes but it doesn't give you that feeling in the pit of your stomach.

For something much lighter *Business Proposal* (Kdrama) is a delight.

*Marvelous Mrs. Maisel* is a high quality show without being too dark.

If you're looking for prestige TV that isn't dark, *Mad Men* is fantastic.

There's also *Downton Abbey* which has drama but is ultimately a feel-good show.

I'm with you though, I don't have much time for TV, I won't watch shows that make me feel bad. I could watch White Lotus, Succession, or House of Dragons for that reason."
Couples Come Dine with Me,"Check out Wilfred (U.S version, but the Australian original is badass too) my guy. Stars Elijah Wood and is 4 seasons of blossom 

Also Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency. I love Bart"
Couples Come Dine with Me,a lil tinfoil here but google predictive programming.
Couples Come Dine with Me,No popular shows do not make me feel depressed.
Couples Come Dine with Me,I laughed more watching the White Lotus s1
Couples Come Dine with Me,"Try Extraordinary, streaming on Hulu, or Disney+ if you're not in the US. The characters are imperfect and a mess but it's ultimately something that makes you laugh and feel good."
Couples Come Dine with Me,I’m with you on that. I watched a few episodes of The Last of Us and it was really well done and the actors are incredible but I already get the Sunday scaries and I don’t need more things to make me feel hopeless on a Sunday. It might do better for a binge when I’m feeling up to it as it seems like a really good show.
Couples Come Dine with Me,"I skipped all three for this reason…. There’s dark (for example, the show “dark!”) and then there is hopeless. I won’t watch hopeless. Luckily Succession is coming out soon 😂"
Couples Come Dine with Me,Why would the white lotus make you depressed
Couples Come Dine with Me,"I won't watch the Last of Us, not into watching that end-of-the-world construct. But I didn't think White Lotus was depressing. I didn't think it was particularly interesting but it was just a story about rich confused idiots. Euphoria, with its pandemic-y theme, was only depressing to me because some of my favorite actors got stuck in such a stupid show."
Couples Come Dine with Me,"you should start watching Barry and Silicon Valley, both of them tackle dark stuff but at least they are fun"
Couples Come Dine with Me,Only House of the Dragon. That show was just miserable.
Couples Come Dine with Me,You’re following all of the young left leaning crowd shows and that’s what they are into. They have much more pessimistic outlooks and often border on nihilism.
Couples Come Dine with Me,HBO magic baby!!
Couples Come Dine with Me,"Who would have thought that HBO -- the channel which gave us such optimistic shows like Oz, The Sopranos, The Wire, Six Feet Under, and The Leftovers -- would decide to put out such depressing shows recently"
Couples Come Dine with Me,I haven’t seen any of them. I’m watching SNL until Only Murders and It’s Always Sunny come back on
Couples Come Dine with Me,I've heard really good things about Abbott Elementary!! I'll check it out!
Couples Come Dine with Me,Ghosts is generally not mean spirited
Couples Come Dine with Me,Idk season 2 was pretty depressing tbh
Couples Come Dine with Me,"I dropped it for that reason.  Show felt like 20% sci fi, 80% horrific character trauma"
Couples Come Dine with Me,thank you I appreciate it :)
Couples Come Dine with Me,"See Episode 3, yet?"
Couples Come Dine with Me,Just don't ever double-feature *Paddington 2* with [*A Very English Scandal*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggDTJc470Co). You'll get some *very* serious casting whiplash.
Couples Come Dine with Me,"> Then I realised that some people at least are looking for something in the world that echoes how they are feeling inside because they can't express it themselves and need to feel seen or understood.
  
I think this is exactly what it is. You see the same thing in music. People assume listening to metal music would make fans feel more angry, but for most it actually makes them feel calmer."
Couples Come Dine with Me,"It's hard for me but I can't help but think, anytime someone says a show that's popular actually sucks because it's ""grief porn' or ""a depressing show for a bunch of sad sacks"", ""wow, good for you that it doesn't resonate with something inside of you. There's no space for it. No dark corner of your soul it burrows into. No covered up tragedy or sadness in your past that it instantly connected with like nothing else has. Congratulations, and I hope you have that going for as long as possible.""

Because a lot of society doesn't want to explore those things. So you keep them apart from you and don't think about them.  There's no time and no one else wants to be bothered with it.  It can feel isolating and lonely.  And then a piece of art comes along and says ""I see you. We're here together""."
Couples Come Dine with Me,"Precisely. It’s therapeutic if nothing else (for some).

Shows like Mr. Robot were not exactly happy by any means but they were very touching."
Couples Come Dine with Me,The uplifting story of inappropriate workplace relationships.
Couples Come Dine with Me,Yes thank you I love the Great British Bake-off! Peacemaker looks cute and has really good ratings I'll check it out!
Couples Come Dine with Me,"I don't think that character in Foundation was hated because she was ""wimpy"" exactly. It's just only 1 out of 3 plotlines in Foundation had solid writing behind it."
Couples Come Dine with Me,I think the antihero trend might be peaking.
Couples Come Dine with Me,"That's true I did really enjoy Wednesday! 

I think it's probably the fact that when I watch a really dark show it sticks with me so I notice it more... compared to a good show that's not dark I don't remember it as much."
Couples Come Dine with Me,Wouldn't really describe Tess situation as suicide really. She wasn't planning to do that before she got scratched
Couples Come Dine with Me,"I know!! I'm glad they added more to his story to get lgbt representation but I'm sad that it had to be in the form of him dying from (what I assume) is AIDS. 

I wish we could have lgbt characters that aren't dying sad deaths. I guess we have Ellie which is good but I heard that it gets really really sad later on so I honestly might stop watching."
Couples Come Dine with Me,"thank you for the recommendation, that looks super good!! I'll have to check it out."
Couples Come Dine with Me,"Seconding.

(And I think it did a lot of the stuff people liked about TLOU better)"
Couples Come Dine with Me,:|
Couples Come Dine with Me,"Hey man some of my favorite movies are childrens cartoons- think Into the Spiderverse for example. Animation is a great medium.

also if you haven't seen Puss in Boots I'd recommend it it's really good!"
Couples Come Dine with Me,">You're comparing prestige, career-defining Puss in boots... to HBO dramas ?

fixed that for ya, puss in boots slander will not be tolerated here onwards"
Couples Come Dine with Me,Attorney Woo and Business Proposal are both really cute kdramas in Netflix
Couples Come Dine with Me,"> so it'd be nice if Ted Lasso would announce a fucking start date for S03.

I mean.....it did..... a while back?"
Couples Come Dine with Me,I love Wilfred but it is dark af.
Couples Come Dine with Me,The second season just ended so dark... everyone betraying each other and you know that every character is unhappy idk.
Couples Come Dine with Me,I couldn't get past like episode 3 of season 1. The feeling of impending doom was too strong
Couples Come Dine with Me,Even the funny shows are dark
Couples Come Dine with Me,"There seem to be a ton of reruns happening at our home, just finished new girl and are currently running the middle.  I only occasionally watched the middle, so it has been kind of nice to occasionally catch an episode here and there.  The kids are the ones running the main family room tv, and they both tend to cross paths as the show continues on between one working or going to school and vise versa.  I tend to watch more comedy, though in recent years comedy has tended a bit darker or raunchier and I'm just not interested in that."
Couples Come Dine with Me,That's just football
Couples Come Dine with Me,"At times yes, but I would say it’s more cathartic in an ultimately uplifting kind of way. And season 3 I expect to continue an upward trajectory."
Couples Come Dine with Me,"I do recognize that these shows are all very well made and are very engaging, just that they're sad. Sometimes I don't want to watch a show because it reminds me of past things, especially like Euphoria. I had to stop watching it. 

I felt the same way with shows like the most recent Joker and also Uncut Gems. They made me feel terrible and really stressed out. Were they really well made movies? Yeah, but sometimes I prefer to take a break from life and watch something that brings me some joy.

I totally understand your point though, and I agree with what you're saying."
Couples Come Dine with Me,I'm talking about the youngest Cleon clone.
Couples Come Dine with Me,"That's a valid point. I've just seen a lot of ""death is the best option for me"" actions in my media lately."
Couples Come Dine with Me,"Avatar The Last Airbender is one of my favourite shows

I'm not so deluded that I am comparing it to something like The Wire, or The Sopranos.

You're comparing apples and bananas, man."
Couples Come Dine with Me,"thank you LOL. 

Also the actress Bella Ramesey that plays Ellie in the Last of Us also voices Hilda, another really good cartoon!!!"
Couples Come Dine with Me,What is it? I was seeing ads on the weekend that merely said 'coming soon'.
Couples Come Dine with Me,"I definitely enjoyed it, but it gave me almost none of the good feelies from season 1. Season 1 reminded me of being a kid and watching things like sandlot or angels in the outfield or the mighty ducks. I went into season 2 hoping it would be the same, so it was a bit disappointing, but I still liked watching it. We will see what Season 3 brings."
Couples Come Dine with Me,Uh no that guy was not hated at all lol. Widely regarded best part of Foundation
Couples Come Dine with Me,"It's literally on the sidebar of this sub, and you can google that shit."
Couples Come Dine with Me,"Oh yea the Cleon storyline was the best, I'm talking about the youngest clone who it turns out is defective."
Couples Come Dine with Me,"The app I use doesn't show the sidebar. And yes, I could Google. You could also fuck off."
Couples Come Dine with Me,I never saw anyone in the viewing audience complain about the youngest Cleon.
Come Dine with Me,I haven't heard of this show but recently I've been getting into british tv on Netflix. You guys have some really good shows and I love the differences between the shows the US has remade. the UK Kitchen Nightmares is really good.

Come Dine with Me,"I do recognize that these shows are all very well made and are very engaging, just that they're sad. Sometimes I don't want to watch a show because it reminds me of past things, especially like Euphoria. I had to stop watching it. 

I felt the same way with shows like the most recent Joker and also Uncut Gems. They made me feel terrible and really stressed out. Were they really well made movies? Yeah, but sometimes I prefer to take a break from life and watch something that brings me some joy.

I totally understand your point though, and I agree with what you're saying."
Come Dine with Me,I'm talking about the youngest Cleon clone.
Come Dine with Me,"That's a valid point. I've just seen a lot of ""death is the best option for me"" actions in my media lately."
Come Dine with Me,"Avatar The Last Airbender is one of my favourite shows

I'm not so deluded that I am comparing it to something like The Wire, or The Sopranos.

You're comparing apples and bananas, man."
Come Dine with Me,"thank you LOL. 

Also the actress Bella Ramesey that plays Ellie in the Last of Us also voices Hilda, another really good cartoon!!!"
Come Dine with Me,What is it? I was seeing ads on the weekend that merely said 'coming soon'.
Come Dine with Me,"I definitely enjoyed it, but it gave me almost none of the good feelies from season 1. Season 1 reminded me of being a kid and watching things like sandlot or angels in the outfield or the mighty ducks. I went into season 2 hoping it would be the same, so it was a bit disappointing, but I still liked watching it. We will see what Season 3 brings."
Come Dine with Me,Uh no that guy was not hated at all lol. Widely regarded best part of Foundation
Come Dine with Me,"It's literally on the sidebar of this sub, and you can google that shit."
Come Dine with Me,"Oh yea the Cleon storyline was the best, I'm talking about the youngest clone who it turns out is defective."
Come Dine with Me,"The app I use doesn't show the sidebar. And yes, I could Google. You could also fuck off."
Come Dine with Me,I never saw anyone in the viewing audience complain about the youngest Cleon.
Come Dine with Me,Yeah that was pretty much the most popular storyline. No one cared about an actual Foundation but they cared about Cleons and yes they cared about the young one too.
Come Dine with Me,Yeah that was pretty much the most popular storyline. No one cared about an actual Foundation but they cared about Cleons and yes they cared about the young one too.
Come Dine with Me,"Damn, no wonder you’re looking for something light to watch. Definitely need something to de-stress by the looks of things. Season 3 starts tomorrow btw"
Come Dine with Me,Or I could become one of those people who expect others to do everything for them?
Come Dine with Me,"I actually defended the character in the most active Foundation sub on here at the time. 

Apparently he was supposed to make a move for power by killing the older Cleons or something. It was absurd.

I wonder if it has anything to do with viewers being used to playing video games, any character they are put into the POV of they subconsciously think how do I win?"
Come Dine with Me,Thank you.
Come Dine with Me,I didn't ask you to comment. You could have just scrolled on by.
Come Dine with Me,Really can't understand your experience. The Cleon arc was best part
Come Dine with Me,"Apologies, your highness, I don't know what I was thinking!"
Come Dine with Me,"Neither do I. Anyway, clearly we're both feeling aggressive today. You have a good day and I'll do the same."
Come Dine with Me,"If it is to be said, so it be, so it is."
Come Dine with Me,He finally negotiated his Gregxit
Come Dine with Me,"Braun:

>”That was kind of a big one,” Braun said of the announcement. “We were expecting it while we were making the show, but you don’t believe it till Jesse says it. We’re all pretty bummed. I was sad as hell my last day.”

>“I finished (shooting S4) a couple weeks ago, and it was really a tough day, you know, saying goodbye to everybody. It’s been the greatest working experience of my life. So saying goodbye to those people was really tough.”

>”We had an idea (of how it ends). None of us read the script before it came to us — a table read draft came to us — so we didn’t exactly know how it was gonna end. Anyway, the ending is fire.”

>“Greg gets battered around again this season. Some fun stuff.”"
Come Dine with Me,he just like me fr
I AM A KILLER: RELEASED,"I've only watched the first two episodes so far but I'm enjoying it.  It definitely has a gritty, dark feel to it while balancing against the humor.  Some great up and coming stars in it too (it took me a minute to realize that Khalid was Franklin from Snowfall).    
  
I was curious, is the title cards in the beginning of each episode, 'This is a true story, any similarities to persons, living or dead is intentional'.  Is this more a tongue in cheek commentary about social media stalkers/stans or was there an actual case this is based on?"
I AM A KILLER: RELEASED,"If Donald Glover is attached in any capacity I’m here for it, but the plot sounds good too. I’ll definitely give it a watch."
I AM A KILLER: RELEASED,"So dark! This show is wild AF but it's an entertaining take on stan culture. I definitely can't use stan anymore cause it's not that serious 😩😂

Can we talk about the dog being name Otis and the actor who played Marissa's dad in epi 5 who was in The Temptations movie 😂

'Aint nobody thinking bout you Otis!'"
I AM A KILLER: RELEASED,"Damn, not that much a fan of her a music but Billie killed it as this weird cult leader figure in episode 4. I would totally watch an entire movie about her in that role"
I AM A KILLER: RELEASED,The Show is twisted AF & I'm here for it. I've watched the first 4 episodes so far & really dig it.
I AM A KILLER: RELEASED,"Can anyone help with some observations/questions?? SPOILERS AHEAD

Did the parents ""really"" think Dre killed Marissa or were they just twisted? Did they think she actually murdered her or do they know she didn't return her calls for help? 

Do you think there's a possibility Dre did actually kill Marissa? She goes into fugue states and we've seen her send messages from Marissa's phone to herself. 

When Dre goes to Marissa's parents' house it's extremely grand and the parents are quite young. When we see it again in the crime documentary it's more humble (still nice though) and the mom is played by a different, older actor and the dad in the photos is a different, older actor too. Did she even go to the house? 

The singer is played by a different actor at the end, is she played by Chloe Bailey?"
I AM A KILLER: RELEASED,The episode descriptions makes this come across as something that'd take place in the same universe as his Atlanta series and I'm all here for it.  Thanks for bringing this to my attention.  I'll likely order in a pizza and a bottle of Mariah Carey's Black Irish on drizly so I can sit down and watch this whole thing.
I AM A KILLER: RELEASED,Is Dre special needs? Flat out serious. I’m watching the first episode and I’m just trying to understand some of her actions/behavior.
I AM A KILLER: RELEASED,Episodes 6 and 7 confused me
I AM A KILLER: RELEASED,"Even though it's about a serial killer, because this is a Glover show, there are small instances of humor peppered in each episode. It's kind of like Barry, where you will be laughing at something absurd, and then someone gets gruesomely murdered right after it. The real life Beyonce references are all great, especially with the elevator fight, and the who but Beyonce mystery from years ago. The special guest actors have been good too."
I AM A KILLER: RELEASED,Thank you Donald for getting Chloe Bailey to take buckshots in this show.
I AM A KILLER: RELEASED,I'm confused by the headline... Is his name in the show Stan? Or who is Stan?
I AM A KILLER: RELEASED,Jfc just watched the first episode. I’m speechless. Wow.
I AM A KILLER: RELEASED,Is this a miniseries or S1 of a longer story?
I AM A KILLER: RELEASED,Well this is bonkers. Obviously if you like Atlanta it's for you. I like it but can't binge it because I need to like...digest it and watch some light stuff to break it up.
I AM A KILLER: RELEASED,Stan culture getting dragged and I love it.
I AM A KILLER: RELEASED,I thought it had more to do with Ni’Jah clearly being a stand in for Beyoncé.
I AM A KILLER: RELEASED,"Can you (or anyone else) help me understand if this show is “scary”?  Like is it just creepy in a “Stranger Things” or “True Detective S1” way, or does it have legitimate horror elements?

Just trying to determine if I can watch this with my partner or not. Thanks!"
I AM A KILLER: RELEASED,"Janine Nabers answers this in an interview here 

https://www.shondaland.com/inspire/a43275160/swarm-janine-nabers/

“The pilot episode is based on a true event that existed on the internet. We started the story from there and kind of built off it with real events that happened in America between about 2016 and 2018. Obviously, because it’s TV, we’ve taken a little liberty. When I pitched the pilot story to [Glover], we knew that Dre, our lead character, was going to connect the dots to the rest of the story that we’re telling within this two-and-a-half-year time period.”"
I AM A KILLER: RELEASED,In the 6th episode there is a true crime documentary type episode where it makes it seem like the show is based on a true story. It'll make sense when u get to that episode
I AM A KILLER: RELEASED,Probably a Fargo reference too maybe?
I AM A KILLER: RELEASED,This show blurs the line between what’s real and fake nowadays. The disclaimer sets that tone.
I AM A KILLER: RELEASED,"its good, i watched it today b4& after work. im a glover fan"
I AM A KILLER: RELEASED,It really keeps throwing curveballs at you in terms of how fucked up it can get. And I’m only on episode 2.
I AM A KILLER: RELEASED,">!I think the parents definitely think she had something to do with her death. Whether directly or indirectly. They didn't like her or care for her as a child and then they got rid of her. Then their blood daughter continues a relationship with her and ends up dead. They are definitely blaming Dre as either projection or they really think she killed her. And there is a definite possibility Dre did kill her, with all of Dre's hallucinations.!<"
I AM A KILLER: RELEASED,"Regarding the house and the parent actors: 

At the end of episode 6, >!the documentary, we see footage of Donald Glover on a red carpet talking about making the show Swarm. So the documentary that is episode 6 is from the ""real world,"" and the show Swarm we're watching is an adaptation of that ""true crime"" story. That's why the details/actors aren't exactly the same.!<"
I AM A KILLER: RELEASED,Donald Glover said in an interview that they do in fact take place in the same universe
I AM A KILLER: RELEASED,Special needs? Idk but she's definitely not stable
I AM A KILLER: RELEASED,"I've only seen ep 1, but I noticed some autistic traits in her character."
I AM A KILLER: RELEASED,She seems autistic for sure in the series
I AM A KILLER: RELEASED,It's meta AF. True crime inception
I AM A KILLER: RELEASED,I’m assuming that’s a typo
I AM A KILLER: RELEASED,"Stan is a term for a psychotic fan. Derived from one of Eminem's biggest hits, ""Stan,"" which is a narrative tune told from the perspective of an unhinged fan of Eminem's. This show is about a woman obsessed with a pop star."
I AM A KILLER: RELEASED,Ever heard Eminem's song Stan?
I AM A KILLER: RELEASED,Eminem created the word. It’s a mix between Stalker & Fan
I AM A KILLER: RELEASED,"Portait of an Artist as a Young Man is a James Joyce novel, so they're taking that and adding some pop culture references"
I AM A KILLER: RELEASED,Miniseries
I AM A KILLER: RELEASED,last episode is sad
I AM A KILLER: RELEASED,"She obviously is, what I'm asking is if there was a story of one of her fans going full killer like this.  I'd never heard of that so I assumed it was more comedic than serious but dunno, maybe I missed it or it wasn't a big story."
I AM A KILLER: RELEASED,Has some quite gruesome scenes
I AM A KILLER: RELEASED,Not scary but there’s gore from killings
I AM A KILLER: RELEASED,"I don't think she killed her just because the 6th episode with the detective's point of view entails that it was in fact a suicide. I think if Dre really killed her, she would of been caught already and the death would of been ruled with foul play. Reason Dre doesn't get caught is cause she kills people almost completely unrelated to her"
I AM A KILLER: RELEASED,"Meta!!! I still like my interpretation where we've been seeing things from Dre's perspective, but you might be right"
I AM A KILLER: RELEASED,"Ahh that makes sense. I was wondering why none of the photos or people matched up in that episode. 

Also why they bleeped out the name. >!It's Ni'Jah in the dramatization, but Beyonce in the ""real"" world. !< I was wondering why they did that."
I AM A KILLER: RELEASED,Yes like a intellectual or developmental disability. She seems as though she is possibly on the spectrum.
I AM A KILLER: RELEASED,"That song is great, but the fact it’s created a pretty widely used term for an obsessed fan (even for those who have never heard the song) is even cooler"
I AM A KILLER: RELEASED,">Derived from one of Eminem's biggest hits, ""Stan,""

I did not know that."
I AM A KILLER: RELEASED,"Interesting, yeah I'd never heard that before. Definitely familiar with the Eminem song but didn't know it had spawned a phrase two decades later. I'll be honest, it sounds weird to say, must be a Gen Z thing, I guess."
I AM A KILLER: RELEASED,Falker didn't have quite the same staying power.
I AM A KILLER: RELEASED,"I mean, for Eminem it was just a name I'm pretty sure."
I AM A KILLER: RELEASED,"No, I'm pretty sure the headline is referencing the actual horror movie Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer"
I AM A KILLER: RELEASED,Do you know because you watched the last episode? Because I can't find any info on it being a miniseries
I AM A KILLER: RELEASED,I’m saying that I think the disclaimer is more about her and how she’s portrayed rather than Dre.
I AM A KILLER: RELEASED,The show is based on several real stories and internet rumors about crazed fans. There are a few articles about it.
I AM A KILLER: RELEASED,That’s helpful. Thanks!
I AM A KILLER: RELEASED,abed would be so proud
I AM A KILLER: RELEASED,Maybe developmental bc of her childhood trauma. I think it's psychosis...
I AM A KILLER: RELEASED,"Well fan is short for fanatic, and was used for particularly big followers of an entertainer. Now it's used for anyone who enjoys an entertainer. The term stan started out meaning an obsessive fan but nowadays is commonly used for someone who is just a big fan (and is commonly self applied), so it probably will go the same route as fan meaning we will need a new word for deranged obsessive fan soon."
I AM A KILLER: RELEASED,"Tbf people started used ""stan"" in this meaning almost right after Eminem's song. Nas calls Jay-Z Biggie's stan on Ether and it was released in 2001. But yeah, ""stan"" even was included into Merriam-Webster a few years ago"
I AM A KILLER: RELEASED,"It's been a pretty common phrase for years now. Millennials use it all the time, at least younger ones. Considering they'd be the ones who were in their formative years when ""Stan"" released, I'd probably say it is more a byproduct of that generation than Gen Z."
I AM A KILLER: RELEASED,lol wtf people have been using stan as slang since the 2000s
I AM A KILLER: RELEASED,"Nahh, he purposely came up with that name & it’s meaning. There was an interview I watched back a few years ago."
I AM A KILLER: RELEASED,"Watch the Stan music video, it's about a crazy fan"
I AM A KILLER: RELEASED,You know what the song is about right?
I AM A KILLER: RELEASED,"There’s a LA Times interview with the showrunners and they said it’s a limited series. I can’t link the interview, but you can Google it."
I AM A KILLER: RELEASED,"It's a complete story.

That's not to say it couldn't get renewed as an anthology, though."
I AM A KILLER: RELEASED,Ah gotcha.  Didn't really consider that angle.  You're probably right then.
I AM A KILLER: RELEASED,I fucking hate the way the term Stan is used nowadays. People diluted it to the point where it's pretty much synonymous with the word fan.
I AM A KILLER: RELEASED,That's how language works. Fan was similarly diluted.
I AM A KILLER: RELEASED,"I wouldn't say synonymous. If someone tells me they are a fan, I'm gonna assume they like it. But if they say they are a stan, then I'm assuming they know all kinds of shit about whatever they are stanning. Its a super quick way to tell the level of fandom."
I AM A KILLER: RELEASED,"Best example I can think of is that a mere 10 years ago, ""woke"" was just a fancy way of saying ""alert"""
I AM A KILLER: RELEASED,"Not synonymous yet, but heading that way. Fan used to mean what stan means today."
I AM A KILLER: RELEASED,"I think her sister coached her in what to say the second time. I don’t think Victoria could come with that on her own.
Based on the evidence I think Victoria is guilty. I am surprised, though, that her attorney didn’t try a battered spouse defense."
I AM A KILLER: RELEASED,i dont think victoria would be smart enough to completely cover her sons murder. theres no evidence at all that proves the son did it
I AM A KILLER: RELEASED,This episode was a waste of 45 minutes i want back
I AM A KILLER: RELEASED,"The only times I thought she was being less than honest was in the beginning when she said she didn't know why she did it, just some voice told her to do it.  (Could mean she was covering for her son or just not being honest on her motive.)

The second time, was her second interview (the fallow up) and in that interview I thought she was lying through the whole freaking thing.  I'll get back to this later.

When she talked about that day and the murder...  she struck me as being completely honest. 

The sister has plenty of reason to think her sister didn't do it and might not be able to accept she did it.  From survival guilt (they grew up in a shitty environment and she made it to a productive life and her sister, who took beatings for her didn't), to just being her sister.  But she mentioned a couple of times she had circumstantial evidence that proved the son/nephew did it beyonda doubt... ah, that's not what circumstantial means.

She also wrote a book, you see her signing it and taking money (maybe it's to pay for her sister's future defense fund) and she's on the radio/podcast promoting the book and the host says something like, ""hey, I know you're trying to sake/promote this book so u won't go into all the details..."" and the sister just laughs.  

WTH? Are you their to promote a book or proclaim your sisters innocence?  I know if I had a book that got me on a podcast/radio show I sure wouldn't care about book sales I would be telling the host something like. ""I don't care about book sales I want your audience to know my sister didn't do it and here's every detail they need to know!""

Sister claims the cops had blinders on...  cops knew about the nephew's call for help in regards to suicide and homicidal thoughts.  They tested both for GSR, there's blood splatter on her not on him.  It's possible the cops got it wrong but I'm not seeing blinders at all.

Also the sister didn't care when the murder happened but started caring later?  Maybe it's not really love that brought her into the case...  maybe it was greed.

I just don't trust the sister she seems less than honest.

Lastly, the son.  If your mother took the wrap for killing your step-dad would you never visit her in jail?  That just seems really callous.  Really, really, callous.

Now, if your mom (who wasn't really that good of a mon) killed your step-dad it doesn't seem that big of a stretch to cut bait on a relationship...  right?

All of that doesn't matter.  She plead guilty and offered no motive as to why she killed her husband and until she proclaims her innocence and says her son did it there's not a lot to be done.

So why didn't she just come out and proclaim it but hinted at stuff in that last interview...  I honestly don't know but it sure will help sell that book now."
I AM A KILLER: RELEASED,You can't re-create blood spatter like she had on her face.. that's the single most important clue that she did it. The sister is just an attention seeker and delusional.
I AM A KILLER: RELEASED,"I just watched this and the last interview did seem calculated.  If you just read Betty's eyes, there is emptiness while looking at her sister/hearing what is being said.  Betty repeats how Vicky is not intellectually all there so it would make sense in her mind to take advantage of that.  It was sus to me how Kenny literally went out of the country; although, Vicky seems genuinely blacked out during the trauma based event that she ulitimately committed."
I AM A KILLER: RELEASED,I think she did it.
I AM A KILLER: RELEASED,"I think the perfect opportunity for a false conviction, had there been one, was not for her but for Kenny. He called the cops and said he was feeling homicidal. Imagine if he had been convicted on that info alone—imagine *anyone* being convicted of any murder in their immediate circle just based on that. And if her intellect is what people claim, there is no way she was savvy enough to tell Kenny to clean up while she had castoff all over herself.  Oh, and she stuck to the same story all this time and never wavered until her sister so happened to write a book? My bet is she’s guilty."
I AM A KILLER: RELEASED,"I think the mom did it. I really feel like Betty just can’t accept it. The power dynamic in the last scene was CRAZY to me. It definitely seemed like she was coached. I think it’s obvious there’s no chance for a retrial, so it kinda makes me feel like Betty is coaching her responses for profit. I mean her whole book is about why her sister didn’t do it. If she continues to say she did, why would anyone buy the book? The woman’s first interview alone just seemed so much more genuine. Whether she did it or Kenny, I can see why this was an open and shut case. Physical evidence + confession & no condemning evidence for Kenny… yeahhhh. Only thing that was weird to me was her being convicted on 1st degree. Didn’t seem premeditated from what evidence was given. Idk, overall Betty just didn’t sit right with me…"
I AM A KILLER: RELEASED,I think son might did it. Just to note this is purely based on what's seen in the episode.
I AM A KILLER: RELEASED,"I honestly think she did it. Her sister coached her to say alot of things. Writing a book?on your own nephew? If her sister did it with her knowledge and she went ahead and wrote the book, she's a terrible aunt just as her sis is also a terrible mom. The blood splatter on her face how do you explain that? And she shot him more than once, she really wanted him dead. Poor Kenny....he was struggling mentally, him trying to get some help is now being weaponized by his aunt. Her intro with low IQ and home issues was to gain sympathy and I do feel bad for her in that aspect. But she can't be that smart to cover her son's murder."
I AM A KILLER: RELEASED,"Can you wash off gun powder residue easily? I don’t think you can, so in that case there’s no way the son did it. Same with the blood spatter on the mum…ok she could have been standing next to him when he shot him, but there was zero blood or residue on him and she had the residue on her hands. She has a very low IQ which means there’s no way they covered up his involvement. 
I’m just shocked she didn’t have some sort of battered wives defence. I actually do feel for her."
I AM A KILLER: RELEASED,"I think she clearly did it, gunshot residue and blood splatter along with an immediate confession, along with subsequent confessions and a guilty plea means it's an open and shut case (there's enough evidence even without a guilty plea).

But her sister wants to sell more of her book and told her what to say the second time they interviewed her..."
I AM A KILLER: RELEASED,I dont think she did it. I think it was the son and he washed off after doing it
I AM A KILLER: RELEASED,People who have had strokes often have hallucinations.  At least that was the case with me.  It took awhile for that to stop.
I AM A KILLER: RELEASED,after the first interview I didn't suspect who was the killer and her sister almost convinced me Kenny did it. But after I saw the second interview it was no doubt that she is the killer 👍🏽bad decision for her to switch the manifest
I AM A KILLER: RELEASED,I think the son manipulated her 🙂
I AM A KILLER: RELEASED,"The truth is that we have very limited clues about what might have happened. We, as viewers,  are like doctors trying to give prescription to a distant patient, judging by a single photo of his hand. In other words, we know nothing.

We don't know much about the mother-son relasionship other than that she was a bad mother. We don't know what happened the previous day and as much about the day of the murder. Generally, we know so little that it is ridiculous to have an opinion.

Based on what they show us, the only thought I have is that she spent all her life being abused and hit by others and it seems she never did something about it. Many times, people abused in childhood repeat this pattern in their adult life. They choose people abusing them.

Was it a coincidence that she decided to hit back during the time her child was around?

10 shots are a lot in a calm state of mind. But then again, calling the police after only 10 minutes is weird if you are not calm and she sounded calm enough to me on the 911 call.

Evidence show she did it. But maybe the son played a role to push her into that direction. Maybe the son would do it, so she took action on his behalf."
I AM A KILLER: RELEASED,I believe Victoria is innocent. She simply couldn't have shot Chris 12/18 times. The son did it and Vicky shot like 6 times to cover her son. She wasn't covered with enough blood on her face to indicate that she killed Chris.
I AM A KILLER: RELEASED,Let me ask you something. 10 times shot? Wouldn’t there be way more blood spatter. It was very mild. Just was thinking about this.
I AM A KILLER: RELEASED,"When theoretically she could have shot him after he was already dead to get the GSR, and blood spatter which would still get her in prison.

I'm not really conflicted about her being in prison or not, I'm more worried about her son being the actual killer or involved in some shape or form and getting away with it.

Sadly it doesn't matter what the truth is, only that matters is what can be proven. Confession, GSR, motive, circumstantial evidence and the will all build a pretty strong case.

In any scenario she's done some pretty bad stuff. Either she's a murderer or someone who protected a murder and helped cover for him. She deserves to be in prison. How long? That's a difficult debate and not just in her case."
I AM A KILLER: RELEASED,"I felt she may have been using the low iq thing to gain sympathy so people would think she was fully there, she seemed articulate and aware.. When she doesn't give a reason (there has to be one) i thought maybe she killed him bc he gave her son a black eye, in the documentary they talk about how the son could have been mad the stepfather gave him a black eye so killed him... but i wondered how she would have felt,, they did say she cared about family a lot🤔🤔"
I AM A KILLER: RELEASED,"I believe you can wash the residue off pretty easily. I don't know if she did it, but most people don't go from having a clear record to shooting someone the way she did.

Also, why is it hard for people to believe she is slow? The first thing I got from her before she said it was that she had a mental disability."
I AM A KILLER: RELEASED,I think the son did it. She’s taking the blame. 10 shots a little overkill if you ask me. He pulled the trigger and she finished it off and took blame.
I AM A KILLER: RELEASED,"That's why we have to follow the evidence. The truth doesn't matter as much as what can be proven. Sometimes it gets the wrong people in prison and sometimes the wrong people get away with it. But if we start convicted people based on circumstantial evidence then the system would be way worse as a whole.

I'm not really conflicted about her being in prison or not, I'm more worried about her son being the actual killer or involved in some shape or form and getting away with it.

Sadly it doesn't matter what the truth is, only that matters is what can be proven. Confession, GSR, motive, circumstantial evidence and the will all build a pretty strong case.

In any scenario she's done some pretty bad stuff. Either she's a murderer or someone who protected a murder and helped cover for him. She deserves to be in prison. How long? That's a difficult debate and not just in her case.

That's why  I wish we saw some interviews or even interrogation with the son.

Sadly we have to take the evidence for what it is."
I AM A KILLER: RELEASED,"No,I don't think there would be. This is what I study in school rn. I'm no expert, but from what I've studied, seems like no. Also, you cannot reproduce that. Literally impossible in that scenario (not a movie set,for example, I mean)"
I AM A KILLER: RELEASED,"Oh yeah she clearly has a mental disability and they said a very low IQ. I did some research and gun residue won’t come off just by washing your hands because the tests these days can detect even 0.000003 minuscule of residue. I’m not sure either of them were smart enough to know how to get every drop of it off his hands in time, and only hers. But I guess we will never really know!"
I AM A KILLER: RELEASED,I just wonder if she’d have more blood spatter on her for shooting him that many times. It just looked so mild. I guess distance could matter but still.
Cobra Kai,"The creators said from the start they always envisioned a 6 season run, so this isn’t too surprising. Plus after how season 5 ended, it makes sense. Ended it with the big spectacle"
Cobra Kai,"What would have been after the Sekai teikai? 
Galactic Karate Gurren Lagen?"
Cobra Kai,6 seasons is a great run!
Cobra Kai,"Yeah, the >!Sekai Taikai!< seems like a good spot to end. Where else can you go from there?"
Cobra Kai,I really enjoyed this show. It is cheesy and campy at times but somehow charming and endearing and just entertaining.
Cobra Kai,Hope Hilary Swanks appears in this
Cobra Kai,"I've been watching this show since it was on youtube red and as much as I would like this show to go on forever, it does seem to be a good spot to end the series."
Cobra Kai,"I'm fine with this seeing how the last thing they have to resolve is the Kreese story arc. Honestly just want to see Tory get a good resolution to her story, maybe finish bonding with Samantha's mom and bring Kreese around with some redemption. Chosen finally going on a date would be good. Miguel and Sam solidifying their relationship. Basically just wrap everything up in a satisfying way and this will go down as a great series."
Cobra Kai,"This is the *bingiest* show I've ever watched, and I wasn't even a huge Karate Kid fan. I'm sure they'll go out on top, hopefully with a Hilary Swank cameo thrown in there for good measure."
Cobra Kai,goodjob xolo. dope this made it off youtube and became what it did.
Cobra Kai,"Cobra Kai has been such a nice surprise and it feels like Season 6 is the perfect time for them to end it. The show is way better than anyone ever expected it to be.

Hopefully it goes out strong and then we can wait another 30 years for All Valley, the Cobra Kai sequel series where the grown-up kids struggle to keep the world together with karate in the face of global climate disaster in the post-apocalyptic San Fernando Valley."
Cobra Kai,This show has no right to be as good as it is.
Cobra Kai,I mean season 5 basically ended with them saving the world of Karate. Unless they throw in time travel or go to space not much else to do.
Cobra Kai,Please more Mike Barnes in S6.
Cobra Kai,"You're the Best ..... around .....

I really hope this song kicks in during the final battle."
Cobra Kai,"This show has been SO much better than anyone would have guessed or that it has any right to be, and it hasn't really lost much as the seasons have gone on.  But at some point it's going to start wearing a bit thin, so it feels like ending after six is a perfect way to end before that starts to happen.  Hell, even if season 6 were to be a total disaster (which I would NOT bet on - I think they'll stick the landing for sure) they've banked so much good will through season 5 that it would hardly even matter overall.

I'll miss it, but going out on top is a good way to go."
Cobra Kai,"This show's trajectory is pretty impressive. It could've easily been a forgettable YouTube Red series that would feel like some sad late cash grab but it winds up being a critically acclaimed success, moved to Netflix and got a Best Comedy nom at the Emmys, in addition to revitalizing the franchise."
Cobra Kai,"Way to end with a bang!! Excited for the last season.

>When Daniel LaRusso arrived in the Valley with his mother in 1984, little did he know that his life was about to be forever changed. The same went for three young kids from New Jersey who hadn't yet met one another. Daniel's journey from bullied teen to underdog hero became an indelible part of our childhoods, and something that we would always carry with us in our hearts.

>Reacquainting the world with The Karate Kid universe has been our humble honor. Making Cobra Kai has allowed us to join the same hallowed dojo once inhabited by the great Robert Mark Kamen, John Avildsen, Jerry Weintraub, and all the amazing original cast members. It has also enabled us to play sensei, expanding the original storylines and birthing a new generation of underdogs. We've never once taken this opportunity for granted.  
>  
>Our day one goal with Cobra Kai has always been to end it on our terms, leaving the Valley in the time and place we've always imagined. So it is with immense pride and thankfulness that we are able to announce that achievement. The upcoming Season Six will mark the conclusion of Cobra Kai.

>While this may be a bittersweet day for the fandom, the Miyagiverse has never been stronger. This fandom is the BEST on the planet and we hope to be telling more Karate Kid stories with you down the line. Because as we all know, Cobra Kai Never Dies.

Cobra Kai,Every season has been great so far. End on a high note and leave them wanting more.
Cobra Kai,"I can't imagine anyone is surprised, with the exception of a couple of dangling threads the show mostly felt done at the end of season 5. At least they can wrap it up properly.

That'll still leave the question though, is the new karate kid movie related to the old movies, this series or a full reboot."
Cobra Kai,"Spoilers for season 5:

>!In season 5 they made all of Daniel's younger foes into friends and tied them all well together. I am glad it's ending because I don't want random unnecessary drama of fighting over nothing again, Daniel and Johnny seem to have moved past that.!<"
Cobra Kai,Looking forward to this ending. This show has been a pleasant surprise and a great ride
Cobra Kai,"I love this show so much and sad it's ending, but they seemed to have a plan and no point in making more just because."
Cobra Kai,I just want Hilary Swank to appear! She’s the only part of the series to be unacknowledged
Cobra Kai,"Hope it's a nice long final season that doesn't feel rushed.  Finish Krease arc, finish the final tourney, happy ending."
Cobra Kai,"Whatever season ended with the Vietnam Flashback and the kids fighting in a super long shot at the LaRusso house was at its peak. 

3 I think?"
Cobra Kai,"I guess there’s only so many storylines they can do about the kids constantly changing teams and fighting each other. 

“We’re rivals and we hate each other! Oh wait we’re on the same team now. Wait we’re rivals again, I hate you even more now. Hug me brother!” It’s getting tedious."
Cobra Kai,"Really hoping the final season is super-sized with a few extra episodes, maybe even enough to break it up into two parts."
Cobra Kai,I really like how they handled Terry Silver's character.  I didn't expect much when they first introduced him but he ended up having a really interesting character arc.
Cobra Kai,Wild to think this started as a YouTube Red show
Cobra Kai,They just better have Julie Pierce make an appearance before the show is over.
Cobra Kai,"I figured Cobra Kai would get a 6th and final season. Glad this show is getting the chance to wrap properly. It was definitely one of the best comedies of recent years and one of Netflix’s better shows. 

I wonder if we will see some spin-off shows? I know the creators talked about doing some a year or two ago."
Cobra Kai,"It always sucks when show I like end, but this feels right. I would have been sad, but ok with it ending last season. I feel like it could have been wrapped up then. Still, I look forward to the coming season. It’s been a fun show. What sucks is when a show ends before it should, with a cliffhanger ending or when a show drags on to the point where even it’s biggest fans are wondering why they are still dragging it out."
Cobra Kai,"That makes sense, it’s pretty much reaching its apex for karate based drama, and this way they won’t have to navigate a weird “kids going off to college”/ Cobra Kai: The New Class type nonsense."
Cobra Kai,"As a “Cobra Kai” fan, this makes sense.

Or is that *sensei?*"
Cobra Kai,I’m really going to miss this absolutely cheesy and awesome show. What a way to bookend the movie series.
Cobra Kai,"Jesus, they’ve already done 6 seasons of that show?! Where the hell have I been? I feel like that show was brand new just a couple years ago. Wtf man…"
Cobra Kai,I’m so glad Hawk made a comeback. He’s my favorite character.
Cobra Kai,"They had a great run. 

Who would have thought a YouTube show would make it 6 seasons. 

All we need is for Hillary swank to show up."
Cobra Kai,"Cobra Kai is one of my favorite, honestly entertaining shows. From the start to wherever it is right now, I really haven't found anything bad to say about it. The story is simple (they're not superheroes who has to save the world!) and I love all the characters.

One thing that did surprise me though, was how the little brother grew up a lot physically in just a season or two."
Cobra Kai,Bring in Hilary Swank!
Cobra Kai,"I’m currently finishing season 3. I gotta say, the first season was really great. Seasons 2 and 3 are decent and I enjoy the cameos from the movies. The whole massive karate fights breaking out everywhere in the valley in modern times is just so ridiculously unbelievable, but that’s why this show works."
Cobra Kai,... and a movie?
Cobra Kai,There's only so many issues you can solve with karate
Cobra Kai,So a movie and 6 seasons.
Cobra Kai,"Hear me out; HUGE battle scene at the end. Kobra Kai, Eagle Fang, Myogi Doh destroyed. Senseis all dead. Students beated beyond hope of complete emotional & physical repair. Russo home & Motors in flames. And rising from the screams of pain and anguish and blood and smoke of annihilation; a ""Man called Stingray."""
Cobra Kai,That’s one hundred in Netflix years
Cobra Kai,"I am VERY, VERY glad! It's a beautiful show, and I love it when the creators have the guts to come to a beautiful conclusion rather than drag it on!"
Cobra Kai,That's 17 seasons in Netflix years.
Cobra Kai,"I want to believe that Cobra Kai will end with season 6...
But we all know Cobra Kai never dies."
Cobra Kai,Probably a smart decision.  I still like the show but it's been slowly losing its charm.
Cobra Kai,Tbh...good call. They've kind of been just recycling the same rivalries and plot over and over again
Cobra Kai,"usually I'm bummed to hear about shows I like ending but I think I'm fine with this, all the seasons have been really enjoyable with great character growth all around and having it ""end"" at a 6th season and not cancelled prematurely is pretty nice"
Cobra Kai,Probably a good call. It's almost a cartoon at this point.
Cobra Kai,"It was time. I'll definitely miss it, but at least they can focus on making it a good final season"
Cobra Kai,might be cool if they could somehow get Hilary swank on the show before it ended
Cobra Kai,🥺
Cobra Kai,No. I want karate kid the college years.  I won’t stand for this not happening
Cobra Kai,"Good, you either die a good series. Or you jump the shark and keep going on like Riverdale.

I stopped after the weird cult stuff in Riverdale btw, figure I stuck it out longer than many I would think."
Cobra Kai,I'm happy that they aren't going to drag it on and on. Six is perfect for this.
Cobra Kai,Cool.  Now do a 3 Ninjas reboot.
Cobra Kai,When are we going to get a youre the best montage
Cobra Kai,I really would like to see the Rockyverse cross over with the Miyagiverse at some point.
Cobra Kai,Five more seasons than the standard Netflix run.
Cobra Kai,"A shitton of Netflix’s biggest IPs are having their final seasons. Stranger Things, Umbrella Academy, now Cobra Kai"
Cobra Kai,There will definitely be a spin-off Show
Cobra Kai,Good. It's a great show that goes out on their terms.
Cobra Kai,Wonderful. Finally a self contained show that's amazing that won't be beaten to death.
Cobra Kai,Oh god please I want it to end with daniel and johnny fighting 1v1 in secret a la Rockey 3.
Cobra Kai,"For all my peeps wanting Julie-San to return, this is the latest news I could find:

She recently appeared on Kelly and Ryan and stated that she gets asked all the time if she’ll be on the show but they have never actually asked. (However the writers have talked about it in the past.) Seacrest did say on the show that ""After today that's going to change, Hilary Swank, I can promise you."" [source](https://people.com/tv/hilary-swank-talks-possibility-of-reprising-karate-kid-role-in-netflix-cobra-kai/)

Shortly after Ralph Macchio said in a recent interview with cinema blend that he heard her comments with Kelly and Ryan: “You would imagine that Julie Pierce and Daniel LaRusso knew each other even though we don’t have those scenes and I’m not a part of that specific film. These guys just amaze me all the time with what they’re able to create, and the fact that they just don’t create it for fan service. They really create stories that work and enhance characters. And then the fact that it’s fan service as well is why I think it’s working on all cylinders. So, there’s my long answer to the short question that I really don’t know, but I expect if there’s an opportunity it will be taken up on.”
[source](https://www.cinemablend.com/interviews/what-cobra-kais-ralph-macchio-thinks-about-hilary-swanks-comments-about-not-being-invited-to-the-show)

Fingers crossed that it works out!"
Cobra Kai,Sad Panda noises 😢
Cobra Kai,Ready for the young Miyagi show.
Cobra Kai,I’m not ready.
Cobra Kai,I really need to watch the first five seasons.
Cobra Kai,Go out on top
Cobra Kai,It's crazy to think that this show started as a YouTube original.
Cobra Kai,That show is treating the karate tournament like winning makes you Emperor of Earth. Everyone is way too serious about it and I love it.
Cobra Kai,"And so ends my subscription to Netflix. Haha just kidding, I never watched the show and I'm using a friend's account."
Cobra Kai,"Wow they got 6 ~~years~~ seasons out of milking that bit from ""How I met your mother""...crazy"
Cobra Kai,For me it ended at the waterslide race. It was the climax of the entire series for sure
Cobra Kai,"Noooooooooooo.

I mean, I get it. But I'm still so sad about this. Damn."
Cobra Kai,Oh shit .... Netflix actually renews something
Cobra Kai,Six seasons and four (or five) movies.
Cobra Kai,"Pretty sure nearly 70 y/o Jakie Chan could still come in and destroy everyone, and his back up would be none other than! *drum roll please* ... CHRIS TUCKER BABY! RUSH HOUR 4 COMBO!"
Cobra Kai,That's an impressive run for a Netflix Original.
Cobra Kai,"Tell me they're going to incorporate swank, smith, Chan in the final season. Story probably wouldn't make any sense but it would be awesome to see them on screen."
Cobra Kai,"I just got tired of no one calling the cops and couldn't keep watching past season 3. It started out interesting with Johnny story and connecting to this kid he was helping to grow and who helped him grow. Then it became this constant ""Oh no they karate'd  us! We need to karate them back."" while I kept saying ""Call the police! This is assault!"""
Cobra Kai,It ended at season 4 for me.  I just couldn't keep going.  The schtick had worn off and it just felt like they were repeating themselves.
Cobra Kai,…and a movie?
Cobra Kai,We need another school brawl but this time a kid with a flute gets punched in the face with brass knuckles.
Cobra Kai,Cue all the complainers about shows getting cancelled.
Cobra Kai,"This show is horrible. Terrible scripting, bad acting from most of the child actors and every single adult actor. Awful writing of implausible scenes. Altogether just a very, very bad show. 

I’ve rewatched it all the way through three times and have a couple t shirts and a mug. 😂"
Cobra Kai,"Unpopular opinion, but I thought season one was fantastic, and then it went way way downhill.       
         
At first they had a decent balance of Johnny and Daniel both being decent but flawed guys, and being opposed because of old baggage.  But they had to turn to increasingly bizarre levels of poor communication to justify their continuing conflict.   SO MANY instances of somebody saying “how dare you do this!,” and the other person responding “how dare I do what??”… and then the first guy says “you know what I meant!”, and runs away to prevent the confusion from being cleared up.      
         
And the first season was at least somewhat grounded… after that, the absurd ridiculousness of the plots went up by orders of magnitude."
Cobra Kai,"That's good, they honestly did already too much, I can't see how they can make it bigger"
Cobra Kai,Of course they’re I’ll. They have no where else to go. They’re already trying to one up the all valley under 18 karate tournament… that’s like trying to one up the World Cup only more insane. The all valley is the most important thing in the world. Everyone knows that.
Cobra Kai,[deleted]
Cobra Kai,To be fair that's probably 5 too many.
Cobra Kai,Reading people say how good this show is really makes me feel out of touch.
Cobra Kai,I can’t be the only one that thought this show was cringeworthy shite?
Cobra Kai,"argh, I was hoping for at least one more because I love it and wish it would never end, but that's a tad unrealistic so, eh. Amazing run for an amazing show, at least, the international tournament is a staple of a lot of sports shounen so it makes sense it ends there"
After the Rain,"Was really excited by the title, thinking Tom Waits. Disappointed a little that it's nothing to do with him. Still, sounds funny and I watch a lot of Brit TV, so definitely interested!"
After the Rain,"Two episodes in i'm really starting to like this show.
 The setting feels really grounded while the characters feel like more heightened versions of people you would actually find there. I mean,most of what's been on display could be played as hardcore drama, but it's in how you sense this is a curated story,that there's a storyteller who doesn't mean you any harm, it almost turns into comforting television thh

Doesn't hurt I laughed a lot"
After the Rain,I can't stand waiting a week for the next episode!!!
After the Rain,My favorite Tom Waits album.
After the Rain,"Just from first episode it's like a UK version of Maid but instead of housecleaning, it's sex work."
After the Rain,Would be great to have some sort of Tom Waits anthology series populated by characters from his songs.
After the Rain,Spoiler much?
After the Rain,"It's really great! One of my top three. I like Foreign Affairs and Swordfishtrombones slightly more but all are desert island records for me, for sure."
After the Rain,I'd watch that show.
After the Rain,"It's hard for me to not say Nighthawks for him. That is just a perfect record to put on during a relaxing evening. Dim the lights a bit, grab a drink, and just kinda feel like you're in an intimate club listening to the band."
After the Rain,"""The coffee wasn't strong enough to defend itself, hehehehe""  
  
I bloody love Nighthawks. His laugh is the greatest."
After the Rain,I used to work in northern Alberta driving a pick up around rig sites at night during the winter. That album kept me from feeling lonely during those long cold stretches. Absolutely perfect for the atmosphere. Same with The Heart of Saturday Night.
After the Rain,"I do it as a basis of scheduling.

If I find out a show is cancelled without closure, I don’t bother watching."
After the Rain,"What's difficult for me about this is that the show's that are in their first or second season who inevitably get cancelled, didn't have the viewership to begin with *because* people were waiting for like season 3 or 4 so they can binge it when they have the time and interest in a longer show to enjoy.  


It's a snake eating its own tail. The network/streamer cancels the show that doesn't get ratings vs viewers not watching it as it comes out because they've been burned before by cancelled shows they wait for more content to watch it lol"
After the Rain,"The real abomination is cliffhanger endings. 

When I commit myself to a season of television, I want closure at the end. 

A contrived cliffhanger ending is a cheap and unnecessary trick."
After the Rain,The Babysitters Club was cancelled?! Nooooo! That was such a cute shot of nostalgia
After the Rain,"As someone in the UK, I hate when a show is cancelled with the excuse of poor viewing figures, but it's neither advertised or not available till 6 months after airing in the US if made available at all"
After the Rain,"Finally, some data to hear what I've heard anecdotally A LOT over the last couple of years."
After the Rain,"Yeah it depends on the show.  But I will do this for some shows.


My wife is really like this tho, she almost always waits until is finished before watching.  We’ve been burned so many times before especially with Network tv before streaming was big and they’d cancel them mid season smh"
After the Rain,"Well, yeah.

Paper Girls. Good show, didn't deserve to be cancelled. I think we were five episodes in when it was announced, and then just gave up because we just didn't see the point.

The kicker is that it, and hundreds of cancelled shows just like it, are littering streaming services. With every show we choose to watch we have to look up whether it's been cancelled, or if it's popular so we can gauge if it will be cancelled."
After the Rain,"In reading all of these comments, I find that there is a critical component of the problem that only a few point out: the market is oversaturated. There are too many shows. It's impossible to watch everything all at once. But the studio execs seem to maintain this mentality of making as many large budget shows as possible, in the hopes that a handful will become megahits. 

It's unsustainable."
After the Rain,I just wait for 2 seasons before I start watching most shows.
After the Rain,"\*gasp\*

well imagine that.

constantly cancelling shows after one season becuase they didnt break the ratings in 5 secs has affected viewership.

who could have possibly seen that coming?

im not sure how many /s's to append to this, so just assume infinite sarcasm please."
After the Rain,">A quarter of U.S. adults wait for streaming originals’ finale before starting, citing fears over the show’s potential cancellation with an unresolved ending (27%) or because they do not want to wait for the next season after a cliffhanger (24%). Nearly half (48%) of the participants who said they prefer to wait until the series ends before starting it cited a preference for binge-watching shows."
After the Rain,Netflix: I didn’t do fuckin shit. I didn’t rig shit.
After the Rain,"Still mad about OA. And recently, 1899. Fucking hell

And yeah, Mindhunter"
After the Rain,I’m still so mad Dark Crystal Age of Resistance was cancelled.
After the Rain,I've started listening to audio books instead. Considerably less likely just stop before the story is over.
After the Rain,Only a quarter? That seems a little low
After the Rain,"Yeah cliffhangers at the end of seasons have the exact opposite intended effect... instead of making me drool with
anticipation, i think about the year+ i'll have to wait and i get annoyed. GET TO THE FUCKING POINT

Every season finale should behave as if its a series finale"
After the Rain,"I'm looking at you, Netflix!"
After the Rain,"This is mostly me. If there is a show I am interested on, but it didn't pop off, I won't be watching. However stuff like Rings of Power, Last of Us, Yellowjackets and more are on my list because I know their future is safe. 

Which basically means I watch the mainstream shows and ignore smaller, interesting and maybe even better projects.

And yes, The OA changed my watching habbits."
After the Rain,"I know it's been going on for decades, but I really wish they would stop making the season finale of a show a cliffhanger. Thankfully not all of them do it. 

There's other ways to wrap story beats up without leaving the viewers hanging with no resolution due to a cancellation. 

This is partly why I don't watch things until I know they have an ending."
After the Rain,Streaming services have spoiled us.  TV shows on networks get canceled all the time.  One of my favorite shows growing up was canceled in the middle of the 2nd season lol.   But what did we do?  We found another show.
After the Rain,"This just in - ""Show business execs are detached from reality, and don't give a fuck about what the viewers want."""
After the Rain,"There's  TV Tropes entry for this: [The Firefly Effect](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFireflyEffect). It's been happening for a while, not just with streaming.

I *still* think that streaming doesn't cancel shows any more or less than broadcast TV has ever done or does now, so I don't really feel like it's that big of a deal. 

I strongly suspect that most people in this sub don't understand that there are viewers-per-cost metrics people look very closely at, and chances are your favorite show didn't make the cut. I *do* think they probably wait too short of a time before they make the decision--streaming habits *are* different--but I also think they *know* this. They have more metrics than we every will."
After the Rain,Who the hell wants to invest 10+ hours into something with no ending? My time is valuable. Either the networks need to see a show through or they need to tell the writers to make every season completely self-contained.  No cliffhangers and no open ended bullshit.
After the Rain,"That’s me, 100%; I’m looking forward to starting Carnival Row this weekend when the last episodes come out. I’ve been burned too many times and I HATE cliffhangers. Finish your story while I am paying attention. Don’t leave me hanging so you can assure I’ll come back next year. Tell a good story and I’ll be counting down the days while telling everyone how great the show is. Drop a cliffhanger and I’m out, and trashing your crap storytelling every chance I get."
After the Rain,Especially if that show is on Netflix.  Apple TV on the other hand does a great job of sticking with their titles.
After the Rain,"I hate that some shows I love were cancelled after ending with HUGE cliffhangers, but at the same time I don't really regret watching those shows!

Cancelled shows are part of the life cycle of TV, and even though I have a hard time letting go, I can always rewatch things and just be glad that those episodes got made and are available"
After the Rain,It's funny I made a post about this about a month ago and I was told it wasn't happening.
After the Rain,"I'd bet  long-arc shows are more at risk of this cancellation phenomena than an old-style ""monster of the week"" show.

If I was a showrunner with a netflix commission I'd get rid of my fancy long arc and switch to an old style show where every episode can stand alone.

With the long arcs viewers want to sit down and digest in big chunks, so they wait until there's an arc completion to get to.  Unfortunately by the time the arc completion is broadcast those ""wait until it's fully baked"" viewers habits have sealed the shows fate by staying away.

This is just some stupid theory I've concocted based on nothing but guesses."
After the Rain,"I don’t get this sub sometimes. People complaining about cliffhanger season finales, and yet Severance gets praised, which has a HUGE cliffhanger"
After the Rain,I do this. Too many shows have burned me
After the Rain,"I'm a weirdo


I usually watch 1-2 episodes to see if I like it, then I will wait until the season is over so I know it actually had a finale"
After the Rain,I’m still pissed about Last Man on Earth
After the Rain,I love how the algorithm introduced me to Tuca and Bertie’s existence AFTER it got cancelled. Thank goodness for Adult Swim. The only animation that’s safe on Netflix these days is freaking Big Mouth.
After the Rain,"More shows need to be like Dark. 3 seasons, complete story, satisfying ending."
After the Rain,i wont watch attack on titan until it is done
After the Rain,here's to 22 more seasons of stargate
After the Rain,Last man on earth 😭😢😭
After the Rain,This is the way.
After the Rain,"I don’t even start watching a show until there is like 3 to 5 episodes out, so I can spread them out until the final. 

I blame the writers and how they write. You 10 episodes season but you only have enough material for 6 episodes. So you come up with a bunch bullshit filler. So you will have like 6 episodes really good and 4 bullshit filler episodes."
After the Rain,Sad about Pantheon never getting marketed properly or at all and getting cancelled. It supposedly had a second season that was already produced but might never get released.
After the Rain,I actually started this practice way before streaming was a thing. #Firefly
After the Rain,"I mean lately it seems like I find out shows exist when I see an article about them being axed. These companies aren’t giving things enough of a chance at all. If it’s good, people will find it, but not every show is going to be number 1 and go totally viral the first week."
After the Rain,"I feel like everyone forgot the good old days where they would randomly change the time a show aired without warning and then would cancel it mid-season, never to be seen again🤣"
After the Rain,I'm more and more in this boat. I'm not going to take the limited time I have to invest in a series that's going to end prematurely and without a real ending.
After the Rain,"I've been saying this (not that it's never been said) for a longgggggggggggggg time. It's a toxic relation that dates back to network TV shows. Pilot season starts and network TV shows beg you, with all of their promotional ads, to watch their shows. Give them a chance. Be a loyal viewer. Then when the viewership isn't good enough, which sometimes is based on realistic needs but often seems to be a desire for their show to be the next big hit, they cancel it. Each time it damages the relationship between content producer and viewer. After long enough I was done. I wasn't watching first seasons or even second seasons of shows, I was waiting. 

Then came streaming, it was great at first, but now so many shows get one season or two and then cancelled that I don't start watching. It is even more damaging for streaming because a large part of the value of their subscription service is tied to their library of content. Well, Netflix's library of content is a freaking grave yard of uncompleted series. Who the F\*\*\* wants to start a series that doesn't have any conclusion? It's like libraries only stocking book series that are missing the last 1-3 books of the series and they will never be released. 

So, now I say if streaming wants to survive or thrive they must change their way of business. There's the HBO model: being very picky with what is greenlit for maximum odds of success, investing heavily in the shows so their quality is as high as possible and having a relatively low amount of original programming. HBO pumps out S-tier quality shows but they pump them out slowly because they only put so much on their plate at a time. 

Or, the other option is to overwhelmingly prefer anthologies, mini series, and series that end in 1-3 seasons. From the start, no matter how successful the series, keep series its pre-planned length. [All these shows](https://www.whats-on-netflix.com/coming-soon/new-netflix-series-coming-in-2023-and-beyond/)? 80% or more should be 1-3 seasons long from the planning stage. Increase quality by reducing quantity of episodes. Make each series jam packed with story, character development and reduce fluff, filler and stretching out stories beyond their natural length. Netflix already cancels so many shows after S2 anyways, just make most shows 2 seasons long so their library starts to fill with easily binge-able series that have tight beginning, middles and most importantly; endings.

This would also encourage writers and creators to come to the table with Netflix with more than just a pitch for a pilot and a very loose, general outline and barely an ending. No, come to Netflix with at least most of the first season written and a strong outline for the second season and an even stronger outline for what the ending of the series is going to be. Reducing the ""up in the air, we'll write it as we go along, we'll make changes based on focus group testing's and how the viewers are reacting"" should help increase quality of series as well. 

I would also mention I imagine Netflix would all of a sudden become a very desirable place for writers and showrunners to want to work again. Instead of never knowing their shows numbers and being on edge expecting cancellation after their second season, they would know Netflix is the place to bring your mini series, 1-3 season long story or anthology story and get to make it, completely."
After the Rain,I haven't started a new show in my favorite genre since the OA was cancelled. Just realized it actually
After the Rain,And people said that this wouldn't happen.
After the Rain,"I used to disagree with this idea of waiting, but the cancellation of Reboot (Hulu) was the last straw for me. Give me a real finale, and I’ll watch the whole show start to finish. Otherwise I’m not getting invested"
After the Rain,"Why are smaller streamers not buying rights to these shows and making follow-up seasons?

Surely ratings/viewings that are ""too low"" for Netflix or HBO would work fine for others."
After the Rain,Show runners who write cliffhanger season endings should be fucking fired
After the Rain,Unpopular Opinion: most of the stuff that streaming services canceled `early` deserved to be canceled.
After the Rain,"Frankly, it strikes me as that so many people still watch stuff week to week."
After the Rain,My cousin's been doing this for years after Netflix cancelled a show he liked.
After the Rain,"Lmao yeah it’s not hard to understand. People in US like to act like we’re the only people who exist, but other countries still do the classic broadcasting format and get good ratings. UK (BBC specifically I believe) have like at least 3 prime time drama series that get good consistent ratings cause they’ve been on for like 20+ years. Why do you think the highest rated US series are NCIS, Law and Order, CSI, Greys Anatomy, etc.? Cause all those shows came out during a time where networks weren’t trigger happy to cancel everything, and are still going. Why do you think most modern network series get canceled today? Because that’s the expectation they set"
After the Rain,"Yes Netflix, I am not watching your shows anymore until I know they aren't going to be cancelled. And then you cancel them because no one is watching because they are waiting to see if you cancel the show. Nice little problem you've created for yourself by over green lighting things in an effort to stay on top."
After the Rain,"Right it's not exec bros that don't know what they're doing, it's the viewrship's fault."
After the Rain,/#SaveTheOA
After the Rain,"This is them reaping what they sow by ending each season on a cliffhanger.

Stop doing that so at least we can feel GOOD when we've watched that one season of a show."
After the Rain,Television exists to sell ads.  Period.  The shows are mindless fodder.  Networks give zero fecks about YOUR entertainment.  Toss the TV remote and go fly a kite.  Or take walk.
After the Rain,"Yeah, the whole “release an episode a week” just stops me from watching a show. I cancel the service and forget. Then remember a year later, and watch the whole in a week or whatever."
After the Rain,That’s a heck of a last sentence. Big twist ending there.
After the Rain,I’ve gotten really good at giving up on bad series or waiting until multiple seasons are out.
After the Rain,"I also love a good binge…

Edit: Except for mandalorian. I watch every episode and can’t wait for the next one. Same with the lord of the rings series, so good! Can’t wait to the end."
After the Rain,I do this with a lot of science fiction type shows on major networks. Too many times I have gotten invested in a show only for it to be cancelled season 1.
After the Rain,This is half of it. I also don't waste time watching anything that gets poor reviews.
After the Rain,I often wait for a full season to be out to start watching a new show.
After the Rain,I can't dedicate enough time to TV shows to bother with something that I either won't get closure on or have to wait months or years at a time for the next step.
After the Rain,"I guess I am one of those who wait as I am not a ""diehard"" viewer of most shows, ""hot"" or not.   I can just sit it out, wait for the ruckus to die down, then catch it later. As dedicated viewers breathlessly wait for each episode of The Last of Us. or whatever is hot at the moment,  I am one of those who simply add the show to my queue, to be watched at some future date. 

I never realized my viewing habits had life or death ramifications for at risk series. Goodness!"
After the Rain,"I usually watch as the episodes come out, sometimes I’ll wait a few weeks. It depends on how much time I have. I spend all of it looking for work now."
After the Rain,I’m not afraid of cancellation. I’m afraid that I’ll start watching a show tomorrow and it will continue for ten years with a lackluster resolution.
After the Rain,"I typically don't watch new shoes until they are old shows now. If it REALLY popular, I'll catch up to watch the last season live (Breaking Bad, Game of Thrones to name a few)"
After the Rain,"I've been doing this for years. I wait for whole seasons at a time to finish with animes i want to watch. like My Hero Academia and Attack on Titan. I watched the first seasons of these but now i'm waiting and will them all over again.

same with Demon Slayer and Shield Hero. 

SO MANY animes will start and literally never finish. There are so many 1-3 season shows that just stop without a proper end. There's literally no point in watching them. It really sucks. no I don't want to read about what happens next.

then occassionally some will end up getting a new season after 5-15 freaking years...and then end on a cliffhanger again.

Some will have over 100 episodes and and just stop without a proper end. It's annoying as hell. Same with old shows that ended in the 90's. Sliders just stops and ends on a horrible cliff hanger. Moeisha ends with her little brother being kidnapped by lil Kim or something and it's never concluded.

There should be a law that canceled and airing shows should be allowed to have at the very least 5 episodes to try and conclude. And if it's canceled after a season is over, they get 10 episodes."
After the Rain,Very few shows do I watch week by week. Mostly I wait for the season to end and watch at my leisure. Because screw cliffhangers and waiting for a show.
After the Rain,Yep. Stopped watching plenty in the middle of a season because it was cancelled. Not worth it to me and it’s a dumb thing to include in if you continue to produce a show.
After the Rain,"I’m the same way when it comes to books in a series. Thank you, George RR Martin and Patrick Rothfuss."
After the Rain,"Same behavior here.  I usually wait until the next season starts before I'll watch the previous season.  Some days, I want to watch a couple of episodes.

When it gets canceled, I end up losing interest."
After the Rain,"For me, if I have to wait a whole week for the next episode it increases the chances that I may not get around to watching it. And if I miss a week, I probably won't bother to watch anymore. I have to REALLY be into a show to schedule time to watch it, and I can't think of more than two or three shows in my whole life that I ever watched all of."
After the Rain,"Streaming services are just graveyards now for shows cancelled after 1/2 seasons, especially Netflix."
After the Rain,netflix in particular gave everyone severe trust issues
After the Rain,I just procrastinate and rewatch the same cartoons over and over again while I browse Reddit and tiktok.
After the Rain,This tracks with me. I'm no longer willing to commit my time to incomplete projects. I'll wait to hear whether or not the series was given a final season to close the story.
After the Rain,I definitely think twice about starting a show simply because so many get cancelled...so many good ones too.
After the Rain,I’m kinda leaning towards doing this because I’ve been burnt more than I’ve liked lately. I’ll still tune in for bigger shows that I know won’t be cancelled like House of the Dragon or TLOU.
After the Rain,"I've been doing this for ages.

If shows would actually wrap up a season I'd be willing to get into them while they are ongoing. Even if I'd like more, and there's some threads dangling, I could be OK with things mostly wrapped up at the end of the season. But no, the networks seem obsessed with cliffhanger endings. Which then go unresolved when the show is cancelled.

I stopped watching current shows as soon as the cliffhanger endings became common."
After the Rain,"I watch anime. True, many anime don't get a second season, and that's based on them being long ads for the manga/light novel source material."
After the Rain,"Duh, there is no reason to trust streaming services to finish a show, not even finish it well if they finish it at all. I’ll wait for years before watching a show I want to see. If almost everyone says it ends poorly I’ll just read all the plot points and skip watching it."
Million Dollar Beach House,"Can’t wait to see all the terror, chaos and war crimes being committed in season 2. Season 1 laid down the perfect groundwork for the show to really take off in the coming seasons."
Million Dollar Beach House,Hope young Rhaenyra and Luke actors get cool new HBO projects. They were great
Million Dollar Beach House,That chase nearly gave me a heart attack. Thrilling Westerosi madness at its finest.
Million Dollar Beach House,"Start of the season: NOT INTERESTED
Ep 1: Sign me up
Ep 10. WAIT 2 YEARS HOW DARE YOU"
Million Dollar Beach House,That scene with Otto Hightower and Rhaenyra was seriously beautifully written and performed.
Million Dollar Beach House,Numbers are already massive and this season was a setup season. Imagine the numbers when the dance reaches its peak
Million Dollar Beach House,"despite people saying hbo is amazing and prestigious, the truth is that the majority of their shows do not get viewers. an amazing show like succession only had 2 million viewers in the last season finale"
Million Dollar Beach House,[deleted]
Million Dollar Beach House,pretty solid finale
Million Dollar Beach House,Even with the leak. Well done HBO.
Million Dollar Beach House,"I wonder if the ""No one is going to watch this after season 8"" people have been following along weekly?"
Million Dollar Beach House,"I’m digging it, Emma is a crazy talented actor and that final scene was epic."
Million Dollar Beach House,"While i love this show, i get sad when they talk about the song of fire and ice knowing how it ends :("
Million Dollar Beach House,I mean it’s just such a good show.
Million Dollar Beach House,">Without giving an exact number of viewers, WBD did confirm exclusively to Variety that overall viewership including both cable and streaming rose by 5% with Episode 4, by 3% with Episode 5 and by another 3% with Episode 6. (The company declined to share any information about viewership of episodes 7-9.)

That stat stuck out to me a bit. You'd assume this means episodes 7-9 saw the audience dropping off a bit, which would be a shame since that's kind of when the show was really kicking into high gear. Episode 6 was a bit of a hump to get over though since that's when the 10-year time jump happened (even the showrunners have said it was almost like making a second pilot episode), so I could imagine that causing some people to drop off."
Million Dollar Beach House,Pretty impressive viewership numbers considering the NFL and MLB playoffs were going on. This was such a fantastic start to the series that it sets up future seasons so well. They've nailed the characters and brought the hype back for the GOT universe while still setting this show up on it's own. Can't wait for the next season!
Million Dollar Beach House,I hope the expected amount of action in season 2 doesn't take away from the characters and drama. The best moments of this season did not happen on dragonback.
Million Dollar Beach House,"Spoilers obviously 

This show did a great job of setting up two trains headed straight for each other while also establishing that there was really no way this could have been avoided 

Well, of course there was ways to stop this train *technically*. 

They could have done a great council like they did to pick Viserys, either one of the ladies could have backed down several times throughout the first season, and it was clear that neither of the matriarchs really wanted bloodshed. They hated each other, but until the last scene they didn’t want to murder each other’s families 

But ineffective communication and every character’s disregards of viewpoints that aren’t their own guarantees that none of these safe exits are taken. 

None of these actions were ever gonna be taken by these feudal lords, even if they do briefly consider it

Small problems left to sit until they grew into massive problems. Would have been way easier to fix in episode 2 or 3, and now in episode 10 those problems grew so great that these two trains slowly heading towards each other have too much momentum to avoid a massive crash"
Million Dollar Beach House,Just want to point out that this show was very female- centric and diverse without being preachy and insulting its audience… instead it was an ABSOLUTE DELIGHT… Disney/Marvel take notes!!
Million Dollar Beach House,"This show is gonna be great but the names are frustratingly hard to learn. 

“I’m Larry and this is my brother Darryl, and this is my other brother Darryl”"
Million Dollar Beach House,"Once again we see that it wasn’t HBO that ruined GoT, it was D&D."
Million Dollar Beach House,"It started at 9.9 and ended at 9.3, which is the first time Game of Thrones season is lower at the finish than at the beginning.

This season still the 3rd most watched season in the history of the franchise, only behind GOT Season 7 (10.1-12.1) and Season 8 (11.8-13.6)

It is comparable to Season 6 (7.9-8.9)"
Million Dollar Beach House,"I'm only at episode 3. I loved it so far. But it's nice to see good comments about the whole season. I feel that it didn't have the same level of marketing than GoT, but if the quality is here it's all that matter."
Million Dollar Beach House,"For those who’ve read the books, how much content do they have with Dance of the Dragons? Is there enough there to weave a tight 5 season show or less?"
Million Dollar Beach House,Every fucking episode was a banger. Can’t wait for S2.
Million Dollar Beach House,"If I want to watch this with my wife and have not seen the game of thrones series, will it make sense?"
Million Dollar Beach House,Wow even after the leaks?
Million Dollar Beach House,"Just in the US, right?"
Million Dollar Beach House,Would have been higher if it wasnt for the leak.
Million Dollar Beach House,"After how GoT ended I really didn't think I would be able to get into this. Hell I haven't watched a single second of GoT since the ending & probably never will. This show though, god damn did it ever reel me in. They've done an incredible job & I can't wait for more."
Million Dollar Beach House,"Game of Thrones finale May 19, 2019

So, 3 years, 5 months.

With a pandemic in between, shutting down most productions. 

Was there any show in between that would even come close?"
Million Dollar Beach House,Now do rings of power 💀
Million Dollar Beach House,"This is a series that I'm actually anticipating a season 2.
LotrRoP can eat a bag of busted assholes."
Million Dollar Beach House,Kinds amazing how wrong reddit was about this show. All I heard was how terrible it would be and nobody cares about GoT anymore.
Million Dollar Beach House,Biggest finale since that one a couple years ago lol
Million Dollar Beach House,"I am really excited for season 2.

IF season 1 was laying the ground work.

Because it honestly felt like watching ""the bold and the beautiful"" in fantasy settings if it isn't"
Million Dollar Beach House,I was one of them
Million Dollar Beach House,"Genuinely enjoyed the show. Little slow, yes, but it's gonna pay off, I believe."
Million Dollar Beach House,[deleted]
Million Dollar Beach House,"Viewership was down from the premiere, then. GOT had a bigger finale than premiere for all 8 seasons. HOTD does drag, so this is not surprising."
Million Dollar Beach House,Its funny how every single even just slightly negative opinion here gets swiftly downvoted.
Million Dollar Beach House,"I stopped watching about 5 episodes in. I just didn’t care  about any of the characters. first season of GOT i was invested in many, even ones i hated. Here was just apathy. Might go back and watch later some time but really disappointed."
Million Dollar Beach House,I wonder if the numbers would be significantly higher if not for the leak?
Million Dollar Beach House,It’s not even that good
Million Dollar Beach House,I'm going to have to watch season one again just to figure out who the hell everyone was.
Million Dollar Beach House,"I think some of the haterade comes from  fantasy lovers that wanted to be cast in the show. Seeing the epic wardrobes (way better than Amazon cosplay stuff), epic locations, handsome men and beautiful women they want it….they need it. 

So they go passive projection to quench the fire which is haterade. 

Get a agent."
Million Dollar Beach House,"How is it, honestly? I did the first two episodes but lost interest immediately. Worth giving another shot?"
Million Dollar Beach House,"My only question is, how does Daemon receive word of Lucery's death? 

Oh and did Aemond really stick a diamond into his eye socket? That's metal asf"
Million Dollar Beach House,I haven't seen this yet. Is this show better than RoP?
Million Dollar Beach House,"It’s such a good show. I’m glad GoT came first, not only for the world building but to justify the budget necessary to create the masterpiece that is HotD."
Million Dollar Beach House,"Its an odd show.  S1 had its moments but if it hadn’t been released as a GoT franchise story, it’d have lukewarm reception at best.  

When you have such a narrow scope of characters, and so many of them are unlikable, the writing needs to be pretty great, and this is one place the show lags a bit.  Maybe later seasons will really deliver."
Million Dollar Beach House,Does anyone know how.many seasons are planned for this? I don't want to get into it and be letdown again in the end
Million Dollar Beach House,It was ok. I think the finale did some heavy lifting for a lot of slow episodes early on
Million Dollar Beach House,"Makes sense, since it’s the same show"
Million Dollar Beach House,"I'm sorry but HOTD is nothing compared to GOT. The conflict has been dragged out all season with a few anonymous characters killed off. There is no humor like GOT and the characters are incredibly dull. Matt Smith is holding the show together by a thread. The only interesting event in the whole season happened in the last 10 minutes.

EDIT: Downvoting me won't silence the truth!"
Million Dollar Beach House,This show is great.
Million Dollar Beach House,"Pretty good show, first half was stronger then the second and they made some pretty questionable decisions with the lore but I am still excited for season 2"
Million Dollar Beach House,Tbh I don't really care about this show. I'll probably finish it eventually here but I just couldn't be bothered to tune in while it was airing.
Million Dollar Beach House,I’m truly under the impression people don’t know what good tv is and I’ve just accepted that. I’m no perfect critic but the shows pacing and story are just bad. It’s just so in your face. No real twists or ideas to challenge you what’s so ever. It’s just simple so I guess that’s what people like about it. So be it.
Million Dollar Beach House,"This is like a watered down GOT. Characters are bland, less action less sex."
Million Dollar Beach House,The finale was a bit weak imo - I think they tried too hard to setup the “spark” for Dance of the Dragons with Luke’s death. Plus I hate that they made Aemond all regretful over killing Luke. He’s wanted that revenge for years so I expected him to be laughing maniacally after the kill.
Million Dollar Beach House,I wonder if thats why it was lagging
Million Dollar Beach House,"I'd be happy if the dragons just killed all the people, but I've been assured this isn't what is going to happen."
Million Dollar Beach House,Game of thrones prequel does game of thrones stuff
Million Dollar Beach House,"And just like that, thrones is back"
Million Dollar Beach House,"So what's better: Andor, House Of Dragon or Rings Of Power?"
Million Dollar Beach House,Whwre did all the black people disappear between house of the dragon and game of thrones time??
Million Dollar Beach House,"Wow, wtf thats the first season over with? Nothing fuckin happened! That sucked"
Million Dollar Beach House,It’s a great show
Million Dollar Beach House,The show isn't even that good. I don't know why I watched it. The hype I guess. Whelp!
Million Dollar Beach House,"I haven't started it yet. I'm caught between not caring anymore and still wanting some GoT content. 

GoT really stunk at the end - and it ruined the show for me. I know some people can watch select seasons from a series and be okay with it - but I can't. It ruined the entire series for me. I can't sit down and watch a show I know isn't going to pay off.

I hope this one stays strong. But I have a feeling I'll be waiting for a few more seasons to see if it keeps the quality."
Million Dollar Beach House,"Binged it one sitting. Found the season meh. Too many timeskips. After the Rhaenyra actress change I lost interest and began fast forwarding a lot. 

I am intrigued though by what will transpire in the coming seasons, but based on my understanding of the history of Westeros discussed in the GoT show as a non-book reader, Rhaenyra will not have a good time regardless of whether she becomes the legit queen or not. If she goes through a Daenerys type character development arc of innocent-bad ass-ruler-insane it'll be disappointing for me. 

I also found it interesting that Daemon was the most relatable of all the main characters for me. Dude is an asshole but genuine. The actor playing him is amazing."
Million Dollar Beach House,Bout to be 10million disappointed viewers
Million Dollar Beach House,"That’s it? 

Wasn’t this show supposed to be some kind of phenomenon?"
Million Dollar Beach House,"I won’t be back for season 2. Show dragged, was to dark to watch, and is sooo predictable."
Million Dollar Beach House,Wait. That was a finale?
Million Dollar Beach House,Oh that was the finale?
Million Dollar Beach House,Whoop whoop
Million Dollar Beach House,"Meanwhile, Barry is the underrated MVP of HBO"
Million Dollar Beach House,Why is this newsworthy?
Million Dollar Beach House,[deleted]
Million Dollar Beach House,It really tells more about the viewers than the series. People will watch a pile of shit as long as you advertise it well enough.
Million Dollar Beach House,"The ending was pretty anti-climactic really.

[spoiler]One character that was really a minor character dies and that’s it. [/spoiler]"
Million Dollar Beach House,I stopped watching after episode 6
Million Dollar Beach House,"Hmm, that sounds so small? Even with HBO's small subscriber size?"
Million Dollar Beach House,"It got much better towards the end of the show since i felt it had a rocky start, i have no clue why they time skipped twice but it got confusing fast. I still don’t know which kid is which"
Million Dollar Beach House,Imagine having a successful show based on the worlds most popular porn genre…
Million Dollar Beach House,"But according to the press, episode 10 fumbled?

Why was I downvoted, that is *literally* what the press said, for fucks sake. Here'a s [link](https://twitter.com/i/events/1584448237829705728)"
Million Dollar Beach House,Everyone loves a train wreck!!! Holy crap this season was awful. 😞
Million Dollar Beach House,[removed]
Million Dollar Beach House,"just as i said, viewership went down. i wonder how many downvotes i had from the original post. but facts before feelings!"
Million Dollar Beach House,"And it was ... okay.

TBH, extended shots of people riding on dragons somehow remind me of people in cars, moving the steering wheel left and right while a different scene of some street is shown in the background to make it seem like they are driving.

I was never into GoT because of DRAGONS!"
Million Dollar Beach House,There's nothing else on right now.
Million Dollar Beach House,In US
Million Dollar Beach House,We all knew that would be the case right?
Million Dollar Beach House,I'm about to hit HOD ep 9 wish me luck on my journey
Million Dollar Beach House,"The continuity with the original show is really cool, all the small details add up"
Million Dollar Beach House,"I wonder how many of those 9.3 million are still recovering from the miscarriage scene? (Aside from that, I loved the finale.)"
Million Dollar Beach House,"kinda looking forward to the possible scene of the twins' fight to the death, as written by mr. george"
Million Dollar Beach House,"Wait, that was the finale? I thought there was one episode left!

Emilys Wonder Lab,Peyton Manning is going to be stoked!
Emilys Wonder Lab,I thought the title said Elvis Presley.
Emilys Wonder Lab,That's a very large stretch
Emilys Wonder Lab,"Also not particularly funny so I don't understand the point of sharing it.

If he thought it said Emily And Penis that would have at least been worth a giggle."
Emilys Wonder Lab,"Gale was knowingly and voluntarily cooking literally pounds of meth a week for an evil drug kingpin. I would not call him innocent. Maybe he didn't ""deserve"" that, but that is the meth business."
Emilys Wonder Lab,"No, I understand that fiction isn’t real, so it doesn’t bother me if the protagonist is written as a bad person."
Emilys Wonder Lab,Jack Bauer of 24 was a pretty perfect anti hero. He would break all kinds of rules but it was always for a really good reason.
Emilys Wonder Lab,"You have to actually be heroic in some way to be an anti-hero. Punisher is an anti-hero because he’s fighting the same fight as the heroes, he’s just doing it in a way that the heroes find unpalatable.  Making a villain the main character of a show doesn’t make them an anti-hero.  Walter White is not an anti-hero, Tony Soprano is not an anti-hero, none of the Roys are anti-hero’s, they are just villains. We’re just watching villains be villainous because that’s neat."
Emilys Wonder Lab,"Walter White is a villain.

He happens to be the show's protagonist but he is a villain, not an anti-hero. Of his own admonition too. 

I haven't seen Barry but it looks like it is a similar case.

You're following a villain's story. Unfortunately the marketing for those shows doesn't do a proper job at disclaiming that before you start watching. 

Personally I agree with you here and don't enjoy following villains too much so I don't enjoy those types of shows. Usually.

I'm old fashioned in the sense that I like my protagonists to be somewhat good people. Or at the very least not full-on villains."
Emilys Wonder Lab,"I hear what you are saying. For me it depends. For example Succession is probably my favourite active show and all the characters in it are terrible people. Nobody is remotely sympathetic. But the story is so entertaining that it doesn’t matter. 

But on the other hand I dropped You for the same reason you dropped Barry. I’m not down for following a character murdering innocent women and getting away with it. 

I did enjoy Breaking Bad all the way through. It probably helped that most of the victims of Walt’s transformation into a monster were people that were in the game so to speak. 

Its nice to have characters to root for where you are invested in their outcome. But it’s not a requirement for a good show. And for me I guess it also matters what kind of collateral damage we are talking about that the protagonist is causing."
Emilys Wonder Lab,"Hi it’s me, I’m the problem it’s me"
Emilys Wonder Lab,The cliff hanger from last season was barry getting caught and going to prison. Also it pretty much destroyed his life. He didnt just get off free.
Emilys Wonder Lab,"The Americans is perhaps the show that pushes the anti hero boundaries to the extreme; you see them doing the most heinous things, yet you root for them because it's just a magnificently written show. But boy, does it make me feel miserable"
Emilys Wonder Lab,"For me to watch a show I need someone to root for or care for. Not someone perfect, but someone who is at least not a villain. Even if the story is good, I can't get into it if i don't care what happens to the characters. In the Dark for example: could be a fun show with lots of twists and turns, but since I loath every single character I couldn't care less what happens to them. I would prefer them all and especially Murphy to end up in jail for life or worse (preferably worse!) but I just know that will not happen."
Emilys Wonder Lab,"Everyone turns to entertainment for something different. For me, I want interesting characters above all else. I don't care as much if a character is likeable or relatable. When choosing friends in real life, I absolutely want kind, compassionate people. But I feel those types of characters also often make for boring fiction stories. I certainly don't want every protagonist to be Tony Soprano levels of evil, but as long as I'm not burnt out on that style of story, I'm fine with reprehensible leads."
Emilys Wonder Lab,Good guys should wear white and bad guys should wear black so that we know who they are.
Emilys Wonder Lab,Why do we have to think someone is a good person to be invested in their fate?
Emilys Wonder Lab,"The Last of Us spoilers in P2:

It doesn't bother me at all. I enjoy watching enthralling stories and for both examples, the ""protagonist"" has something they want and their journey is what keeps it interesting. In Deadwood people want Bullock to be ""the good guy"" because he's written to be more ""righteous"" than Al, but in reality Sol Star is more of a ""good guy"" because he doesn't justify bad behavior with questionable ethics. 

Let's be real here; Joel from TLOU isn't an anti-hero either. He's a selfish piece of shit that condemned the entire world to damnation just so he could relive his ""glory days"" as a father, and even then he was not the best dad."
Emilys Wonder Lab,"It was also a kill or be killed situation for Walter.

They needed a cook, and Gale would replace him if he was killed. This wasn’t really a power play as much the only option to assure survival."
Emilys Wonder Lab,"I am sure Barry will turn it around.

As for Walter White, the show is called Breaking Bad.  How good can a Man that makes money from Meth be?"
Emilys Wonder Lab,">I haven't seen Barry but it looks like it is a similar case. 

It's a little different than Barry. Walter delighted in doing what he did even if he at times pretended he didn't. Barry is an extremely mentally ill person who has been taken advantage of and truly seems to not really know right from wrong anymore. He is only really upset by certain actions personal to him, but it's clear he doesn't love any of the terrible things he does.

But overall OP is basically saying ""The case for why the anti-hero theme has gone too far?"" 

""I don't like those stories."" 

Like there is literally nothing here indicating the genre has gone too far, Barry is literally a dark comedy."
Emilys Wonder Lab,I appreciate this perspective. Thanks.
Emilys Wonder Lab,"I watched Sons of Anarchy.
Like you, I have to be able to identify with the protagonist. I want them to be good or like you said at least not full on villains.

But for whatever reason I really did like that show."
Emilys Wonder Lab,"> I dropped You for the same reason you dropped Barry.

Interesting. I have avoided watching it for this reason."
Emilys Wonder Lab,"I think the most recent episode of TLOU was what prompted me to post this. I'm still on the fence about coming back to it, but it got me thinking about other shows I had dropped out of discomfort with the protagonist's actions."
Emilys Wonder Lab,"Yeah well it's easy to say that in retrospect but lots of movies and TV shows have titles that suggest or hint at characters ""going bad"" or showing their ""dark side""... but they really don't 

Breaking Bad just fully went on with it, to its credit I must say"
Emilys Wonder Lab,"Something that i've loved about TLoU since the first game is that in many ways Joel is  a reflect of that world. He's a broken person just trying to do what he can to survive in a horrible world. And so is everyone else. With the exception of someone like David, no one is really good or bad. Joel makes a decision at the end that's been debated for nearly a decade now, and it's been reignited after the season finale, but he also did that against a literal terrorist group that nearly killed Tess in the first episode with one of their bombings. So few things are clean or black and white in that world. And I think that makes for some very interesting stories and characters."
Emilys Wonder Lab,Oh man a show about Boba Fett trying to be a crime lord?  The dream: Finally I get to watch a Star Wars show about a bad guy!  The reality: They just made him a good guy.
Emilys Wonder Lab,"LOST. That show was the king of cliffhangers, and to this day still has the most memorable cliffhangers out of any show I've seen. There's even a [wiki page](https://lostpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Cliffhanger) that lists out all the cliffhangers."
Emilys Wonder Lab,Breaking Bad after Gale opens the door for Jesse
Emilys Wonder Lab,The Best of Both Worlds cliffhanger between seasons three and four of ST:TNG
Emilys Wonder Lab,"The [""Alias"" season 2 cliffhanger](https://youtu.be/sVL5xPoL7dg) killed me."
Emilys Wonder Lab,Lost was basically the king of cliffhangers. They were ending each episode with such crazy cliffhangers - it was like a cocaine addiction. Prison break 1st season was similar.
Emilys Wonder Lab,"""We have to go back, Kate!"""
Emilys Wonder Lab,"Nearly every season of LOST

Alia’s also had some amazing cliffhangers that were torture.

Those were only for a summer though."
Emilys Wonder Lab,"The biggest one I remember was Star Trek TNG's Best of Both Worlds cliffhanger. It's unfortunate that the immediate resolution to the cliffhanger suuuuuucked (Oops, didn't work! 🙄), even if the rest of part 2 was great."
Emilys Wonder Lab,Still thinking about that Severance finale tbh
Emilys Wonder Lab,"Kate, we have to go back!!! 

Not Penny’s Boat!!

Hatch Opened!

LOST was great in those early seasons."
Emilys Wonder Lab,"The Office between season 2 and 3 is a good one. 

I will add Westworld between seasons 1 and 2."
Emilys Wonder Lab,Surprised no one has said The Walking Dead.  That cliffhanger felt like it had the entire nation by the balls for the off season
Emilys Wonder Lab,"Most recently the final season of Better Call Saul being split up. ""Okay, let's talk."""
Emilys Wonder Lab,"The reboot show ""V"" by ABC ended on a cliff hanger because there was supposed to be a next season, but there wasn't.

(Spoilers, if you care) the show ended with multiple main characters being killed and the likely destruction of humanity. It was an unintentionally very depressing ending."
Emilys Wonder Lab,">Historically, Who Shot J.R.? On Dallas was huge, but that was before my time but I’ve always heard that was an absolutely, monumentally, humongous, can’t-miss event for the reveal.

""A Democrat shot Jr.""

\-Republicans during the 1980 presidential campaign.

&#x200B;

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Who\_shot\_J.R.%3F

&#x200B;

>This probably doesn’t come anywhere close to Dallas

we'll never see that again because there are too many other things on TV now, and if you miss the premiere.. so what - everything is on demand. Dallas was ""one of three programs"" on television between 9 and 10 or whatever and if you missed it, you MISSED IT until they rebroadcast..  in those days, if you were a fan of a show, you stuck with it because there's no way to get caught up in the shows on other channels.

&#x200B;

I was too young to even CARE about Dallas but i remember the hype.

&#x200B;

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friday\_night\_death\_slot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friday_night_death_slot)

The term possibly began as a reflection of certain programs' dominance of Friday night in the 1980s and 1990s, which resulted in decreased ratings for those scheduled opposite their competitors.\[1\]\[2\]\[3\] By the 2000s, it was used in reference to the belief that young, single Americans rarely watch television on Friday or Saturday nights, thereby removing from the household what is considered the most lucrative demographic for advertisers.\[4\]\[5\] **With the collapse of the traditional network viewing model where viewers had to be in front of the TV to watch shows (and then the evolution from VCR or DVR capabilities to almost all shows being viewed increasingly through on-demand streaming media), the stigma of Friday night scheduling is much less evident or considered today than in the past.**"
Emilys Wonder Lab,The walking dead season 6 finale and lost seasons 1 and 3 finales
Emilys Wonder Lab,Ozark...Helen getting her head blown off
Emilys Wonder Lab,Season 3 of Barry
Emilys Wonder Lab,"Farscape had amazing cliffhangers. Season two was so good, that when it got cancelled in my country on free TV, I learned the new season was available in Paytv. So I got myself Paytv, which wasn't cheap.

After season three and another killer cliffhanger it was cancelled entirely in my country. So no more dubbed versions. Season four was my starting point of watching shows in English.

Season 4 had again a cliffhanger that left me screaming. First because we already knew that the series was cancelled and two the cliffhanger it self. And a year later we got the mini series. I was very lucky 😃."
Emilys Wonder Lab,It's been 6 months and I still can't stop thinking about the Severance season finale.
Emilys Wonder Lab,"I think all the Lost seasons ended with massive cliffhangers of the sort you described, though I think the season 1 finale was the most ""why you leave me hangin'?"" of them all.  

Battlestar Galactica - Season 3 finale - quite a lot there but the very end was just such a real ""WTF just happened?"" moment."
Emilys Wonder Lab,"One of the recent Chicago Fire seasons ended with the rescue squad guys trapped under a capsized boat in Lake Michigan and their tanks were running out I think. The final shot of the season was like the ambulance medics standing on the pier watching for someone to surface and nothing out there.

Then when the new season came back they got out of danger in like 30 seconds and it really wasn't a problem at all and that annoyed me."
Emilys Wonder Lab,Prison Break season 2 when Michael enters Sona prison
Emilys Wonder Lab,"""The OA"" cliffhanger at the end of S2.

I'm still waiting for the next one. Hopefully, they'll do it sooner or later."
Emilys Wonder Lab,"Cliffhangers belong before a season finale, not at the end of one imo."
Emilys Wonder Lab,"The end of S2 of Dark with the revelation that the scope of the show would be expanding due to ""technological advances"" left me running through all the possibilities for the next year waiting for S3 to come out. It was a perfect cliffhanger that left you wanting to know what happened next.  I almost feel bad for people who can just binge the whole series now without having to wait all that time between seasons."
Emilys Wonder Lab,Sherlock series 2  bbc   24 season 5 psych season 5
Emilys Wonder Lab,The Vampire Diaries had such solid writing the first 3 or 4 seasons that each cliffhanger kept me on my toes all summer long.
Emilys Wonder Lab,"Besides the ones mentioned, Battlestar Galactica season 3 ended on *two* great ones. Largely squandered, unfortunately."
Emilys Wonder Lab,"24 had the best cliffhangers; mysterious woman poisoning the president, Jack shipped to China etc etc"
Emilys Wonder Lab,"Severance

Yellowjackets"
Emilys Wonder Lab,It’s happening right now with me and Severance.
Emilys Wonder Lab,Nip/Tuck. End of season 2!
Emilys Wonder Lab,Arcane has god-tier cliff hangers.
Emilys Wonder Lab,"Lost by far. Every season ends on a cliffhanger, even the last one"
Emilys Wonder Lab,"It’s been months and I’m still thinking of the season 1 finale of severance. I can’t wait for season 2.

Better call Saul season 5 finale was intense I don’t know how I waited two years for season 6."
Emilys Wonder Lab,"Quantum Leap, S3E22 Shock Theater. The climax of the mental hospital leap was so nerve-wracking, and then Sam and Al leap together and Sam is a hologram and Al isn't! And you have to wait four months to find out if it's true and why! And what they're going to do about it! That was a long summer."
Emilys Wonder Lab,"Who Shot Mr. Burns was the talk of my middle school learning camp for the entire summer! We all had theories, and wrote them all down and voted. Maggie had 0 VOTES! While Mr. Smithers had the majority."
Emilys Wonder Lab,"Barry Season 2.

The fact that we had to wait 3 years for the next season also didn’t do any favors."
Emilys Wonder Lab,"I started watching Lost between the final two seasons, so the only cliffhanger I ever needed to really wait for was >!Juliet setting off the bomb!<. I really miss that level of engaging with a show, my friends and I (I was in college at the time) would just throw theories around it was so much fun."
Emilys Wonder Lab,"""We have to go back to the Island!""

I don't remember if that was a season finale or premiere, but I remember that final line blowing my mind."
Emilys Wonder Lab,"Lost wasnt just season cliff hangers.  It was weekly.  You’d watch an episode on Wednesday and talk about it and think about it all week obsess over it until next Wednesday and it would start over.

Love streaming but miss that type of streaming sometimes.  Some shows would benefit from it.   And we get little glimpses of it Only Murders in the Building gives me the same sort of weekly mystery cliffhanger sometimes."
Emilys Wonder Lab,Also Hank on the toilet
Emilys Wonder Lab,"The rumor was, Patrick Stewart wanted out of his contract, and this would be how they kill off Picard.  So yeah, I was a little more invested in this cliffhanger than most others."
Emilys Wonder Lab,One of Riker's most badass moments too
Emilys Wonder Lab,Yes. But I only had to wait until the next day. We were behind in Germany and episodes aired daily.
Emilys Wonder Lab,"It was a good cliffhanger but in retrospect the resolution wouldn't really hold up to modern tv standards. 

Picard is kidnapped, basically indoctrinated, leads a battle that slaughters a significant portion of Starfleet, and they just put him back in command of the enterprise immediately, despite the fact that he is clearly suffering from debilitating ptsd for decades after to the point where they can't bring the federation flagship to help defend earth in first contact because he can't be trusted.  And that is ignoring the justifiably awful position that puts any survivors of wolf 359 having to work with him (sisko for example).  

He shouldn't have gone to jail or anything, it wasn't his fault, but there is no way he ever should have set foot on the bridge of a starship again.  Let alone been put back in command of the flagship.  And then, Will Riker basically saves humanity and gets demoted back to commander for it.  After president has already been set that someone can hold the rank of captain and still be first officer (Spock)."
Emilys Wonder Lab,"Oh yeah, now THAT was a good one."
Emilys Wonder Lab,What a roller coaster!
Emilys Wonder Lab,"The end of the first season with the hatch is still the best.


Also, the Others."
Emilys Wonder Lab,"The BSG cliffie was also great because of all the fakeout Bionic Woman casting stuff, hiding that the actor wasn’t actually leaving the show to go to the creators other show like they were all insinuating in the trades, now that is a stunt I haven’t seen repeated"
Emilys Wonder Lab,"I really liked the cliffhanger ending of Chicago Fire season two, trapping the entire cast inside a collapsing burning building except for one actor and only seeing that actor reacting outside the building was a great way to play it. Definitely spent the summer thinking about what happened inside, sounds similar to the one you mentioned with a less is more approach. Wish they hadn’t iced that particular character in the two cliffhanger however it was that actors choice and they made it count"
Emilys Wonder Lab,That was serious nightmare fuel
Emilys Wonder Lab,"They work, though. Gets people talking about the show and keeps them hyped for the new season.

The Simpsons ""Who shot Mr Burns"" one had endless discussions and bets."
Emilys Wonder Lab,"Why Smithers?

He was a true Burns sycophant if ever there was one."
Emilys Wonder Lab,"It was S3 finale and it also had the ""Not Penny's Boat"" cliffhanger. Lost casually dropping two absolutely huge cliffhangers lol.

And the thing was that Lost had that so many times not just for big episodes like finales. The ending of every episode is a test of your will if you don't want to binge watch that lol. That LOST logo and sound appearing at the end follow some of the best cliffhanger ever"
Emilys Wonder Lab,"Season finale and the reveal that the season were flash forwards, not flashbacks."
Emilys Wonder Lab,Oh damn yea that’s even better
Emilys Wonder Lab,Worth it!
Emilys Wonder Lab,"Yeah, the hatch plus Walt and the Raft was just crazy"
Emilys Wonder Lab,"I know you're trying to avoid spoilers but is that the one where a couple of characters switched places from how they would normally go and then something fell on one of them?

I think I'm avoiding revealing anything for people who haven't seen it."
Emilys Wonder Lab,We were 13 and went with the obvious.
Emilys Wonder Lab,"The season 3 finale with ""we have to go back"" was the first flash forward. It didn't reveal the whole season had been a flash forward just that episode. The rest of season 3 was flashbacks."
Emilys Wonder Lab,The hype was so massive that it had a gravitational pull that it created at least a hundred podcast discussing the show...then the writers strike happened.
Emilys Wonder Lab,"Yes, that’s the one. Having arguably their best actor (who seemed the most likely to die) just slowly start to lose it while listening to things meltdown on the radio for everyone else really stuck with me"
Emilys Wonder Lab,"That’s fair.

Was Maggie a good choice, though? It seems like a bit of a cop out because they tried to go with perhaps the one character probably no one sees coming and a character that they never need to follow up on shooting another character because it’s a baby so cannot be arrested.

Although I guess if they wanted to they could have just had Bart or another major character do it in a self-contained story and still avoid having to follow up on it in the same sort of way."
Emilys Wonder Lab,It time for a rewatch then. I am starting to forget.
Emilys Wonder Lab,"The writers strike didn't actually affect lost. They made half a season before the strike and 5 more episodes after it ended, so they only missed a couple planned episodes from season 4 and added the number to 5 and 6."
Emilys Wonder Lab,"
A good romance adventure western. The closest to The English I can think of is Cold Mountain but as a tv series.     


The cinematography is gorgeous and the writing is excellent, but I wouldn't recommend The English to anyone who doesn't like slow dramas."
Emilys Wonder Lab,"All I can say is, without spoiling, it made me UGLY cry and I havn't cried in a while. I'm not okay"
Emilys Wonder Lab,"I’m half way through. Really good show. I liked the first episode, but it definitely got much better each episode. Can’t believe how under the radar this show seems to be."

Hoops,The obsession with feces got way out of control the more the series went on. I'm no prude but whoever wrote this show is seriously disturbed. It's basically a feces fetish dressed up as an animated comedy. Disgusting.
Hoops,"The showrunners also created *Brickleberry* and *Farzar,* which are all the same show.

Netflix saw what Brickleberry was, and wanted that for themselves. Then, after Paradise P.D, they wanted it again."
Hoops,"There is a youtuber who did a video on this show, and it's similar contemporaries, Farzar and Brickleberry. I suggest giving it a watch.

The point is essentially these dudes have the ability and audience to make the EXACT SAME SHOW over and over again, with barely any deviation, and they continue to get funding to make more of this same show. The shows themselves are derivative drivel meant to be, like you said, the most basic, inane, ""Heeeeeere's the punchline!"" type of humor that is self-aware in how bad it is, but LITERALLY DOESN'T NEED TO CHANGE BECAUSE PEOPLE KEEP WATCHING IT."
Hoops,First season was tolerable. This most recent season is the fucking worst
Hoops,"If it means anything OP, hoops was awful too.

Oh the coach is on the screen, he’s gunna yell and be upset again"
Hoops,"I enjoy lowbrow crude adult animation, I really do.  But Paradise PD really is bad.

it's like the show is written by a bot"
Hoops,"Paradise PD is horrible.

Hoops is also horrible.

I would say that they’re identical levels of horrible for the exact same reasons."
Hoops,"ah, but you've seen it


they won"
Hoops,"the 3 shows by him are all the same show in different settings.  


Brickleberry is in a national park  
Farzar is in space  
Paradise PD is police force  


That being said the characters are all the exact same characters in different bodies, in different places. it's the same damn show with different themes. they even spoil the other shows in the other shows."
Hoops,"An absolutely loathsome show with lazy writing, ludicrous characters and fewer laughs per minute than a Disney film. I tried. Maybe I'm not broadminded enough. We watched three episodes and gave up."
Hoops,"I agree with everybody, first season was great, but the following ones just got worse and worse and all of the poop, sex and drugs jokes started to get out of hand.

Watched 2 episodes from the new season and it was unbearable. No witty or clever jokes, just a machine gun of gross and unfunny remarks constantly where there’s no logic to any of the stories or plot.

Just a big mess of inappropriate jokes that most times doesn’t even make sense.

Hoops was so much better that it hurts"
Hoops,"It’s Yucko the Clown, what do you expect?"
Hoops,Everything by that team is claw-your-eyes-out awful. I'm *embarassed* for them. I hope they all made millions because it would take that much cash for me to be associated with that excrement.
Hoops,My 15 year old loves it. That says everything.
Hoops,"I use it to help me get to sleep, I've been doing it for a year on and off and still haven't managed to watch all episodes. Cartoons help me fall asleep but if I'm too invested in the story I don't like to miss it so Paraside PD is perfect because it's so simply shit."
Hoops,"I absolutely loved this show when it first dropped. Season 1 was hilarious! That episode bit where dude was trying to solve a case with ""*just an ass*"" at the crime scene had be on the floor rolling. lol. 

But after season 1 the show just started doing way too much and got way too out of control for me."
Hoops,"Welcome to most newer adult animation. 

Every ""sitcom"" style adult animation I've seen recently is horrible. Overused jokes hidden behind a veneer of meta humor or just stupid jokes that aren't funny at all.

The only recent one I've been able to finish was Inside Job."
Hoops,In their episodes they also make fun of other Comedy shows such as Brooklyn 99 for being unfunny. And the worst episode of B99 Is still funnier than the entirety of Paradise PD. This show Is on the bottom of the uncanny valley
Hoops,It’s dumb but I like it.
Hoops,"I liked the first season. Then I found out Brickleberry existed and enjoyed it. I was happy to see season two of paradise. But, season 2 felt like a drag. I started season 3, and I just couldn’t: dick dick dick, poop poop poop; i just couldn’t any more."
Hoops,"The female cop was pretty much the only reason I watched the show (and not for reasons some might think). After watching the voice actress on Rosanne (when she played the second Becky) and on Scrubs, I enjoyed watching her play an extreme character. I like it when actors switch it up, even if the show/movie is bad. For every other aspect of the show, I heartily agree with the opinions on how bad the show is. Talented writers can make the low brow humor entertaining, the writers of this show aren't talented enough to do that."
Hoops,"[Jay Exci](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Md75krfN3RI) has several great videos about it (and the show it's a [clone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oz04mSryFFo&t=0s) of). Terrible, but interesting in how it became a money factory for the creators."
Hoops,"You like the hoops but don’t like this? Interesting.  Reddit has some crazy opinions on tv shows, I can’t get enough of paradise PD.  It’s more of a guy humor thing but hoops is more dry than that old man’s balls"
Hoops,"It is horrible, but I did laugh at the Higher Hair joke.   I don't know why I finished the whole series."
Hoops,"Lmao it’s funny that you ended your post with the implication that Hoops is better and deserved more seasons when this is literally the exact same complaints I heard when Hoops came out. So many people said all the humor is dumb, crude “jokes” that aren’t even funny.

I’ve never seen either show but they both look and sound terrible to me"
Hoops,This show has some of the most famous voice actors ever so I'm pretty sure it's just an excuse for them to say fuck and shit.
Hoops, I feel this way about big mouth
Hoops,"Ye i gotta say this is one of the most generic and boring cartoons of this type out there, couldn't last 3 episodes."
Hoops,It’s also just fucking disgusting. No entertainment value at all. Just trying to be as vulgar as possible.
Hoops,"Well it was co-creatwd by basically a ""whack-packer."""
Hoops,"I enjoyed it, and obviously a lot of other people did too since it got 4 seasons and a new show out of it."
Hoops,"I laughed at the first season.  It felt like the sort of natural extension of ""they put that on tv"" from The Simpsons to Family Guy to Archer or Squidbillies, or whatever.  When I started the second season, it was over.  It was nothing but trying to one-up itself to see how low it could go and it stopped being funny at all."
Hoops,"I qm not going to sit and pretend Paradise PD is great, and alive more than once said outloud ""Who is watching this?"", but come on......Hoops was dog water. It wasn't funny, and I'm not sure if it was even supposed to be. It's better than Brickleberry but in space, but not by much."
Hoops,"This is how I feel about most ""adult animation"" shows. It's always a race to the most juvenile, repetitive, and edgy humour imaginable."
Hoops,"See I love the show.
It speaks mto my sense of humor
Trash lol."
Hoops,The META jokes are pretty good... but yeah there is some seriously lazy writing with the characters.
Hoops,"I honestly thought it was me because that show has been trending and several people recommended it to me. I watched the first two episodes and simply though, “What the actual f…?”"
Hoops,"It's a shit show.

No redeeming qualities imo."
Hoops,"Dunno but Mark Zuckerberg saying ""Higher Hair"" makes me laugh every time.

Clappers is fantastic. 

Same with Elon saying Pedo."
Hoops,Someone needs to stop giving Waco O'Guin money
Hoops,fuck man. i LOVE hoops. that show is hilarious
Hoops,This is how I felt about Farzar after watching the first episode
Hoops,I Enjoyed it why you expecting a stoner comedy to be a masterpiece just go into them expecting them to being a shitshow of things thrown at you.
Hoops,"Just watched the trailer. The show has four seasons, wow."
Hoops,"Paradise PD, Brickleberry, and Farzar are all the same show made by the same people that tell the same jokes. They're all horrible and extremely predictable, because each character has about 2 reoccurring jokes attached to them.  


Hoops was also an awful show lol."
Hoops,Fuck that this shows awesome
Hoops,"I tried with this a couple times. Just found myself groaning constantly at any joke, and gave up on the second episode."
Hoops,If you haven't already done it try it with some weed (if you smoke weed)
Hoops,correction it has 4 seasons and a sci fi spin off
Hoops,Yeah I watched two episodes and never went back to it.
Hoops,Dana Snyder’s voice is in too much stuff
Hoops,"The only truly great police show was Blotter. It aired for 7 minutes, super late on TBS to kill time."
Hoops,"It has the same problems brickleberry has, which is not surprising I think they are made by the same creators."
Hoops,if it helps. after seeing a trailer for Hoops i didn't even bother to give it a shot.
Hoops,">Like it’s not funny at all- I feel like it just tries to hav this extreme humour but none of it is funny. Literally every joke is so predictable.

Not only this, at least season 1 & 2 had a story going behind the scenes to keep it somewhat interesting. Season 3 was like straight trash, I haven't bothered watching the fourth installment."
Hoops,"Does any one else use cartoons as white noise I don’t even watch it tbh, it’s like whatever local news channel they have on at the doctors office"
Hoops,They trying too unnecessarily hard
Hoops,teens
Hoops,"There are a few random really funny jokes in the show, but like 50% of it is shit, and as you watch more it becomes more and more literal."
Hoops,I just hope Kyle Kinane gets on a better show now that this one is over
Hoops,it was a dumpster fire for sure
Hoops,"It's like a Walmart-brand Family Guy, written by 12 year olds."
Hoops,There a great video about the greatness that is “smiling friends” and it does a great job showcasing why every new “adult” cartoon show is just terrible and how smiling friends does everything right.
Hoops,Idk. I watched years ago. I probably thought it was funny when high. Atleast the first watch through. I might watch it again.
Hoops,You dare disparage the work of Yucko the Clown?
Hoops,"2023 will have AI that can write and illustrate better show with the prompt: ""reno 911 but family guy"""
Hoops,It's literally just Brickleberry but cops
Hoops,I didn’t get through the first episode of Hoops but Paradise PD isn’t good either. I do however like Brickleberry
Hoops,Dusty has me rolling all the time he’s funny as fuck!
Hoops,Nah this shit is great
Hoops,its the biggest piece of dog shit i've ever seen
Hoops,"I can’t say it’s one of the worst tv shows I’ve ever seen, but I agree the humour side of things has no development. The episodes have absolutely zero direction whatsoever and I find it extremely difficult to sit and watch an episode without spending the whole time on my phone. The storylines go absolutely nowhere and it jumps between one fucking weird scene to another with no relevance to anything whatsoever.

Still, I’d be lying if I said I hadn’t ‘seen’ every episode. The latest episodes are definitely the worst by far. It’s almost as if the writers got absolutely fucking mashed on pills and let their children write a script instead."
Hoops,"Is that’s cause it’s not woke ?

The episode with the black cop shooting himself was the best commentary on U.S. media in recent years"
Hoops,"It's because, as the show's gone on, the two creators have written more and more of the episodes. And there's no one to slap their hands away from the keyboard. They have a very distinct way of writing and you can tell it's them by how crude the humor is. They seem to rely solely on shock value. I actually liked Brickleberry, and I tolerated the first season of Paradise PD; but Paradise PD and Farzar are both awful overall. Brickleberry had similar-ish humor, but they were on a network, so they couldn't rely on just putting the grossest stuff imaginable on screen."
Hoops,I also don’t appreciate toilet humour ngl- like I’m not offended by it I just think it’s- well- shit. Like surely you have to have some creativity and more than 3 jokes to be a writer of a comedy show. I don’t think laughed once- if anything i feel angry after watching it rather than chilled out
Hoops,"Remarkably, a feces fetish is the least disturbing thing about creator Roger Black"
Hoops,It's created by the insult clown dude
Hoops,"Yucko the Clown/Roger Black is one of the creators. He is vile

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PdybnTzMoD4"
Hoops,You could say it's a shit show...
Hoops,Dan Schneider vibes...
Hoops,Brickleberry is dope as fuck imo
Hoops,Jay Exci? At least the shows gave us his content.
Hoops,That LS Mark video is quality
Hoops,I’ve never watched it and yet it always seems to be at the top of my Netflix suggestions: perpetually for years.
Hoops,what youtuber?
Hoops,"no wonder Paradise PD looks familiar. I think I watched a couple episodes of Brickleberry and it wasn't terrible. I googled Paradise PD and I swear I watched it before but it was probably BB. 

Doesn't help that when you Google both the[ same 2 white dudes](https://imgur.com/a/mJuZofB) show up in the same order"
Hoops,"I couldn’t get past the first episode of the new season- I like forced myself to watch the first one cos I’m the past I’ve started a shoe and not liked it then give it another try and really liked it.

Like detroiters took me a couple episodes to get the atmosphere and then I was laughing out loud at very episode. 

And pentaverate I had to readjust to the old school Mike myers type of comedy.

Like I understand some shows u have to sort of get into. But this for me is a brick wall. It’s all just the same one Shit low hanging joke again and again.

But no chance for me and this one if I was on the focal group or whatever if they even did them I’d absolutely refuse it."
Hoops,Hoops was fucking awful. Wanted it to be good because it has Jake Johnson but the show is just terrible and easily grouped with all the terrible “Adult Animation” getting churned out.
Hoops,"Out if curiousity, I had chatGPT write me a paradise PD scene. I have no idea if it's accurate, as I have never seen the show. Enjoy.

It's a beautiful day in Paradise, and the sun is shining brightly in the sky. The Paradise PD officers are all gathered in the conference room, eager to hear what their captain has to say.

""Good morning, officers,"" Captain Dwayne says, standing at the front of the room. ""I have some important news to share with you all. We've received a tip that a group of thieves are planning to rob the local bank this afternoon. And, just to add some excitement to the mix, we've also been told that one of the thieves is a former adult film star.""

The officers all let out a collective gasp, and Officer Kevin can't help but let out a wolf whistle.

""Oh man, this is going to be a good one,"" he says, grinning from ear to ear.

""Kevin, focus,"" Captain Dwayne says sternly. ""I want you to be on high alert and make sure to keep an eye out for any suspicious activity.""

The officers nod, trying to compose themselves and focus on the task at hand.

""We'll also be setting up a sting operation to catch these thieves in the act,"" Captain Dwayne continues. ""Officer Debbie, I want you to lead the operation and coordinate with the rest of the team. Make sure to keep me updated on your progress.""

Officer Debbie nods confidently, ready to take on the challenge.

""Alright, let's go out there and make Paradise a safer place,"" Captain Dwayne says, clapping his hands together. ""And if we're lucky, we might even get an autograph from the adult film star thief.""

The officers all chuckle and stand up, heading out to their patrol cars with a renewed sense of determination."
Hoops,"I honestly think i could knock a script for a show of a similar quality by myself in less than a day, and im not a writer or anything"
Hoops,"Farzar was horrific.

Now that I know the showrunners aslo did paradise pd there is no way I am going near it."
Hoops,Haha very good. This interaction is the funniest thing to have come from that show imo
Hoops,"I’ve given it several tries cos there’s been times before I watched a show hated it watched it again and really enjoyed it. 

Like detroiters I didn’t really get it till the third episode and then I watched every single episode in one night both season 1 and 2 laughing out loud at several points in every episode despite being completely sober.

Pentaverate I hated the first two times, but u have to readjust to that sort of space balls, Austin powers comedy and then it’s funny. 

But this show I actually use to fall asleep cos I need noise to sleep and I’m so uninterested in it and the storyline is so poor/non existent that u don’t really get sucked in watching it and stay awake"
Hoops,"I was shocked to find hoops was cancelled, apparently it was too expensive for the amount of people that watched it- I wonder if it’s cos people think it’s just a cartoon about basketball"
Hoops,My thoughts too
Hoops,"Out of interest, what does he think of shows like American dad, family guy etc and what does he think of the Simpson a"
Hoops,"What the actual fuck

So do I 

I can’t sleep to silence, so I have to have something on, but if it’s something interesting I get distracted, the last three nights I’ve left paradise pd on cos it’s genuinely so uninteresting and shit that there’s noise but I fall asleep so quick

I wonder if there’s more is us and it’s messing with netflixes algorithm cos they think I’ve watched an entire season a night three nights in a row but I’m actually just sleeping"
Hoops,The only somewhat entertaining concept I thought was when the black guy shot himself and had to represent both sides or something
Hoops,"Hoops has like a story line and charchter development at least a bit. Like I’m not saying it’s to everyone’s fast but it’s funny and has multi dimensional charachters (somewhat) 

Paradise PD is literally : sex joke, joke about shit, dog likes drugs, sex joke, joke about shit, dog joke just on repeat. But to the point that based on the charachters on the screen u know exactly what the next joke will be. 

Like if the old man comes onto the screen I know within the next ten seconds he will say he sucked 20 cocks. And that’s the joke. For the whooooole episode. Just again and again. Makes me actually think like wow how do people get these Netflix deals with literally not a single jot of talent or comedic ability."
Alien TV,"Why would you ask him in the first place?  What's he going to say, ""My film won't hold a candle to the new hot shit coming out?""  Stop doing this to aging filmmakers, just talk to them about their current shit."
Alien TV,"Ridley Scott's alien movies will never be as good as his 1979 original. 

-me"
Alien TV,"While i somewhat agree with him, let’s not pretend that some of his other aliens movies came close to original alien.

I am interested in what Hawley brings on the table."
Alien TV,"This should be posted in r/nottheonion as well... as literally Prometheus and Alien Covenant showcased that he still can't make a new Alien tie-in/prequel as good as his 1979 original.

After this, I'm actually hoping Noah Hawley can prove him wrong now."
Alien TV,At this point I’m pretty convinced he is jealous of anyone else touching what he thinks is his IP.  A few years ago Blomkamp had (what seemed like) a really cool idea for a sequel and apparently Scott straight up had the studio kill it so he could make Covenant instead.  A comment like this is in like with that attitude and seems so petty. Someone with his reputation should be using it to lift others in the industry up. Not tank expectations years before anything is even set to come out.
Alien TV,Im sure he said the same about James Cameron’s Aliens back then! 🤣
Alien TV,"Wait. 

There's gonna be an ""Alien"" series on FX?  And the showrunner is *Fargo's* Noah Hawley?  

***Fuck yeah.***"
Alien TV,“Coca-Cola president says Pepsi will never be as good as Coca-Cola.”
Alien TV,"eh, we shall see. 

We have a video game that is pretty close to his 1979, I'll keep an open mind."
Alien TV,Can't be worse than 'Prometheus'
Alien TV,"What a petty comment. It's not a competition. It doesn't have to be as good as the Alien or Aliens, it just has to be better than all other trashy sequels.  

That being said, at this point in their careers, I have a lot more confidence in Noah Hawley's storytelling abilities than Scott's. No doubt Scott is a brilliant filmmaker, but his judgement seems a little dicey."
Alien TV,Ridley should stay away from the alien franchise. I am still recovering from the absolute shit he took on the franchise in Prometheus & Covenant. just go direct another gladiator sequel or something. STAY AWAY... Bad Ridley!
Alien TV,"shining endorsement. 

tbh I dont see the point of the series but I suppose Noah Hawley could do something interesting with it...maybe"
Alien TV,But what does he think of Marvel movies?
Alien TV,"MORE “Raised By Wolves”, please!"
Alien TV,As long as it's not as bad as covenant we should be good
Alien TV,Weird thing to say about a show still in development and before even reading the scripts.
Alien TV,He’s right in that historically these series are generally bad or half the entertainment value as motion pictures. There are exceptions yet there are not many.
Alien TV,"If you haven't, I highly recommend people watch the director roundtable interview which had him as a guest. 


My man comes off straight up psychopathic, uncompromising, driven and alienating. Other directors sing his praises and try to get him to open up but he's just impassive, like he couldn't give a shit what Quentin Tarantino think of him. Really odd but interesting table dynamic."
Alien TV,Ridley Scott says a lot of things
Alien TV,And neither will his latest alien movie will. He must stop saying things like this tbh.
Alien TV,Gonna watch this out of spite.
Alien TV,I'll never get over not letting Neil Blumkomp direct Alien 5. I don't think I'll ever support Scott again. That was such a stupid decision.
Alien TV,"The only Alien film as good as the original was the sequel.

That being said if people are going to make more stuff I'm going to watch it"
Alien TV,"I’d love to see a series on this, but a serious take on it. Not some cheesy WB kinda production. I feel like this is a series best suited for FX"
Alien TV,Neither will any of his later alien movies
Alien TV,Probably better than Covenant though.
Alien TV,"He's being an ass, but he's right. 

FX can't afford to make it what it should be. Which is Alien for 3 episodes then Aliens for the next seven. It's going to be nine god damn episodes of painfully slow story development focused of human drama and interactions with the final episode being the only one with an actual Zenomorph in it for maybe 3 minutes total of screen time. And it'll end with a setup that prepares the next season to be the exact same fucking thing. 

That's not tension. It's not dramatic development. It's cheap and lazy production. 

If the Alien tv series delivers a short but effective tense development in a thrilling colonial marines horror/action series I'll consider it a win. It won't be that. But hey, it might."
Alien TV,"Go back to to CRT screens and the future he created in Alien and what they were able to do in Aliens.  The Nostromo was clean but when you go into the underbelly of the ship it's a piece of shit, or use the Sulaco type ships and space port in Aliens. Heavy loaders that walk, cool weapons if they go that direction, but I'm guessing it will be more of the same Covenant/Prometheus feel with a little AVP2 vibe to it."
Alien TV,"I mean if he’d just made the one or maybe 2 movies? Sure, but he’s done game of thrones level damage to the franchise"
Alien TV,[thanks ridley scott ](https://youtu.be/fmwyWerz5KI)
Alien TV,And the FX adaptation will have many viewers that will never watch or care about the original
Alien TV,He’s 100% right.
Alien TV,Why did he even waste his time saying this?
Alien TV,strong possibility it's better than his other alien movies tho lol
Alien TV,I...I...liked prometheus.
Alien TV,"Ridley Scott always takes shots at other people's work. Remember him saying Blade Runner 2049 was too long, while he was making Alien Covenant at the time."
Alien TV,"No TV show or movie *period* will be as good as the original Alien to me, so it's a pointless standard to hold the show to."
Alien TV,"Raised by wolves on the other hand , 👌"
Alien TV,"without the h.r. giger vision incorporated correctly new stuff will never work.   
the original alien had some sick design philosophy behind it (all the sexual stuff)  
but now its just a space bug, and it will never be interesting again.  


they had a chance with Prometheus, but the messed it up, how wonderful had it been if we had seem more of h.r. gigers world come to life."
Alien TV,Sounds like a cry baby comment. What should it matter if it gets a series? If anything he should be happy.
Alien TV,"Ridley Scott has made two, maybe three great movies sprinkled across decades of mediocrity."
Alien TV,"To be clear, he said ""It'll never be as good as the first one"", not ""It'll never be as good as my movie."" Same concept, but different levels of dickishness."
Alien TV,"What really smashed my ballsack was the way in the early days, Ridley distanced Prometheus from Alien and tore down anyone who compared them. Then he admitted he was setting it in the same universe. Then all of a sudden theres the worst explanation for the derelict ship/origin of the xenos ever imagined, “but its still not Alien!” he says.

Then a huge buzz emerges about Neil Blomkamp’s true sequel to Aliens, everyone goes nuts with joy and forgets Prometheus.

All of a sudden, Fox cancels Blomkamp’s production with immediate effect, claiming the original creator wants to make a true universe sequel instead, so they back him.

Ridley doesn’t even bother with the Prometheus title anymore and just calls it Alien Covenant.

The world becomes sad as the huge dump leaves Ridley’s arse and lands right in the middle of the franchise, stinking of money, industry weight and above all, the creative bankruptcy of a used-to-be genius"
Alien TV,High bar to even come close
Alien TV,Well I’m still looking forward to it.
Alien TV,It only has to be better than his two awful and contrived prequel films. I’m excited for it. FX has a strong reputation for content.
Alien TV,"Just move on, Ridley. The last two didn’t work. Pass the damn torch and go work on your epics."
Alien TV,"Scott just has a sense of ownership over Alien, even though he often ignores the others who helped make the original what it is. Namely Dan O'Bannon, Walter Hill, and H.R. Giger. Without all of them plus Scott, the original wouldn't be what it is.

I'm sure he also feels pissy when someone brings up Aliens and Cameron being just as good his original, which is a fair statement."
Alien TV,"`Alien (1979)` is just a horror/sci-fi masterpiece.

Best you'll get is something _different_ that's equally a masterpiece in it's own right."
Alien TV,"Duh....

And also, fuck off Ridley Scott. You're fucking Aliens films suck SINCE 1979."
Alien TV,"The Alien films are so corny now. It's always the same -- find eggs, facehuggers, everyone dies but one or two people. For god's sake, switch it up a bit."
Alien TV,"The original Alien isn’t flawless. Put your arrogance aside and just watch the thing before you condemn it, Ridley."
Alien TV,Ridley is so sad at this point.  He's trying to answer questions (about the Alien franchise) that nobody is asking or cares about.  Its apparent he painted himself into a corner from Covenant.  I'm an old timer that saw Alien when it first came out in 79.  Just let it go.
Alien TV,"In other news, the sky is blue"
Alien TV,But it might be better than the sequels you keep dropping the ball on
Alien TV,"Well, he would know a thing or two about making *Alien* content that isn't as good as the original, wouldn't he?

Noah Hawley hasn't disappointed me yet, so I'm cautiously optimistic about his contribution to the franchise."
Alien TV,"And Now I Hope its better just so we can throw this in Ridley Scott's face.

Damn ~~Scots~~ Ridley Scott alien movies, they ruined ~~Scotland~~ Ridley Scott alien movies."
Alien TV,"Oh sure, because Alien Covenant was the sequel everyone wanted and loved."
Alien TV,"But would it be better than all the shitty sequels he made, Alien and aliens are the best movies I ever saw in my life all the sequels are just a waste of time"
Alien TV,"Hard to be as good as an original because everyone emulates it for the next few 40 years and what made it special gets watered down to the point that those elements become clichéd. And if they try to change it too much, fans get pissed. If they retread too much, they'll be accused of relying too much on nostalgia."
Alien TV,"I like Ridley, but this comment is so unnecessary.

It's also a complete self-own considering he made 2 other Alien movies after the original. Lol"
Alien TV,No shit
Alien TV,Dude sounds like an angry ex
Alien TV,Ridley Scott is incapable of making a movie as good as Alien.
Alien TV,"Pretty safe thing to say. Exceedingly few movies or TV shows will be as good as Alien. It's an amazing movie. The sequel is one of the best action movies ever made, and still I think Alien is better. If even Aliens can't be as good as Alien then what hope does anything have?"
Alien TV,And he is right
Alien TV,Not wrong.
Alien TV,Duh?
Alien TV,"We all know it, but he didn't have to say it aloud."
Alien TV,Duh.
Alien TV,Not with that attitude.
Alien TV,Uhhhhh duh!
Alien TV,Duh?
Alien TV,I agree.
Alien TV,"Love his work, but Ridley says some real dumb shit sometimes."
Alien TV,I agree nothing will beat his early work...he's lost his touch.
Alien TV,"Neither were your two sequels, so Mazel Tov"
Alien TV,…. A lot of excellent movies aren’t as good as the first Alien movie…. They’re still excellent.
Alien TV,"Just like the 2 newer alien movies were inferior to the first 2, of which he wrote and directed"
Alien TV,Fargo is superb. Legion was so fucking crazy. I cannot wait to see this show.
Alien TV,That’s like saying the suns going to come up tomorrow. No shit it’s gonna come up and no shit it’s not gonna be as good as the original that movie was a masterpiece
Alien TV,"Well, hes probably not wrong but it's not like his latest entries are as good either.  I hated them at first but they are starting to grow on me.  Characterization is still god awful (accept for David) but I'm digging the mythology."
Alien TV,The original was painfully boring.
Alien TV,I mean he’s not wrong but let us film snobs take the flak for saying that. Not a good look coming from him haha.
Alien TV,Alien 3 > Aliens (1986). Fight me
Alien TV,"Well, I say Ridley Scott's Alien movies will never be as good as his 1979 original."
Alien TV,Why he never got behind Blomkamp’s that Weaver was excited about years ago will forever confound me.  Seemed like the perfect guy to do one.  And Sigourney Weaver wanted to do it.
Alien TV,"You know, given his track record since probably Gladiator, he shouldn’t be this pretentious."
Alien TV,"Erm, did anyone catch this line in the article?

> Hawley has already gone on record saying the “Alien” television series is not centered around Sigourney Weaver’s Ripley and takes place on Earth.

Well of course the special effects won’t need to be as great as the original if the entire show takes place at the corporate offices of Weyland Corp and other orgs. 

I can’t wait for the dramatic series of episodes where the WY finance team argues with and then ultimately approves the product team’s off cycle budget request to acquire an off world specimen for bio weapons development.  I’m sure there will be lots of tight shots of MS Excel spreadsheets and arguing of the right hurdle rate!

Or perhaps a series of flashbacks shows focused on Hyperdyne Systems where  procurement tells the “ethical” AI team to scale down their ambitions because the cost per unit is out of control for the 120-A/2 model android. Cue the tearful (and dramatic ) resignations of team members who claim that without an ethics module their androids might do serious harm.  Like lie about looking for dangerous alien life!"
Alien TV,"Given Ridley’s track record when it comes to Alien movies, I’m beginning to think his success the first time was a fluke."
Alien TV,He’s right
Alien TV,So much of what was good about Alien was the fact it was groundbreaking and new. It hit at a moment. You can't just replicate that. You can totally do fan service and rehash past glories. That seems to be what Hollywood is about nowadays.
Alien TV,This guy will never stop being salty that James Cameron’s movie was better than his.
Alien TV,I mean buddy… cmon… no other series you put out after Aliens were good… Prometheus had potential…but sorta messed that one up with the follow up film…
Alien TV,"Give the franchise to Blomkamp, he will make it look awesome!"
Alien TV,Well duh
Alien TV,You blow. I'll do the fingering.
Alien TV,Unless it's on HBO.
Alien TV,"I know money

But then why make this? If you can’t make a better one, then why?"
Biohackers,Is Biohackers season 1 good?
Biohackers,Just remembered I need to finish season 1
Biohackers,To all the people from the region of Freiburg: Does anybody know where this graveyard with the white church is? Can’t find it anywhere close to Freiburg on Google maps
Biohackers,"What I want to know is, who is the actress that plays the therapist for Mia?"
Biohackers,This fucking show gets a second season but not reality z?? Bullshit
Biohackers,Don't watch it if you know quite a lot about science. I don't know how many times I rolled my eyes in just the first couple of episodes and it really took away from the entertainment.
Biohackers,U will suprise how good is it. Im waiting for year for s2
Biohackers,So its that good?
Biohackers,*Cries in Teenage Bounty Hunters/Society*
Biohackers,What's the genre?
Biohackers,you will find out if you like it in the first episode.
Biohackers,"I heard that netflix might bring back some shows that were canceled due to covid. Im not sure if it's true at all, but i guess we'll find out during that geeked week thing. I hope the society comes back"
Biohackers,Thriller
Biohackers,Link?
Biohackers,"Looks interesting but the name ""Biohackers"" makes it sound like a Syfy show/movie"
Biohackers,"""What's this?""

""It's a ~~bio-piano~~ motherboard with a bunch of random shit stuck to it"""
Biohackers,The good thing about the streaming wars is the increased spending in international shows.
Biohackers,"The main character is gonna be a clone of the prof, isn't she."
Biohackers,I've been waiting for this one for ages bc I was an extra in it lol.
Biohackers,Hmm...interesting. What season does JC Denton get introduced?
Biohackers,trailer just gave the whole show
Biohackers,The writers for this must have been on serious drugs. Hopefully Netflix go 2 for 2 on German series
Biohackers,"Hm not sold on this one. Trailer showed to much teen drama. Ill give it a shot anyway because german shows these are pretty decent. Who would have thought, not a native german thats for sure."
Biohackers,Can't wait!
Biohackers,"I read it at first as ""Bioshock"" and now I'm disappointed."
Biohackers,Feel like all of them are
Biohackers,Someone’s copying Orphan Black’s homework
Biohackers,When was it filmed out of curiosity?
Biohackers,Yeah I kinda figured so stopped about 1/3 in
Biohackers,Have you seen how to sell drugs online fast? It's a really good german show. It's short with 6 episodes each season and only around 30 minutes each
Biohackers,"Its really good tho, just binged it yesterday!"
Biohackers,"I‘ve been only part of the lecture scenes, which were shot in June 2019."
Biohackers,Goes to show that Netflix then have a shit tonne of series waiting to premier then lol
Biohackers,"> The show debuted on the platform globally August 20. It tells a story of revolutionary biohacking technology and intrigue at a German university, focusing on a mysterious student played by Luna Wedler.


> Filming will start on season two in the coming months in Freiburg and Munich."
Biohackers,I really liked this show. Was a surprise for me. It's just 30-35 minutes 6 episodes. All the things that happens on the show it's pretty fast. Definitely not a boring show.
Biohackers,OK teen show. The bio stuff is interesting but the hipster party fest is annoying.
Biohackers,"The thing is :the plot is predictable at some point but I felt like it didn't matter because the pacing was so on point. It is told in a very fast an straight forward way. I didn't felt bored once and the show intrigued me more with each episode.
And somehow you feel for the main character despite knowing the science stuff is not that well portrayed.
Its not perfect but I totally enjoyed myself."
Biohackers,"This gets a second season but not the society... yeah, okay"
Biohackers,S1 felt like part 1 of a full season so I'm glad
Biohackers,"It was good. Definitely used a lot of familiar tropes and was predictable in many ways, but it was entertaining and somewhat original. I look forward to a second season."
Biohackers,I heard it wasn't that good because they don't really go into detail with the biohacking stuff and it is all just superficial. Is it still worth a watch?
Biohackers,Hope they revamp the dialogues. Watching it in german was painful. It was so bad that you could tell that it is a german production.
Biohackers,why are the end credits almost as long as the episode?
Biohackers,"To be fair I think some random 6 episodes German show likely has a different budget and different level of expectations to meet than one of Netflix’s original English language shows. 

I’m with you in being unhappy The Society got the chop though!"
Biohackers,The Society is so cringy I stopped watching after a couple of episodes and I don't normally do it. This show is fast and felt natural enough for me. I watched it in German.
Biohackers,"I do say it is mainly because it's just 30-35 minutes and 6 episodes.  
Is not a perfect show, but it's interesting and get your attention."
Biohackers,"I found it to be very meh, and they only keep you watching because of the ""mystery"" which is not much of a mystery, while having forgotten to write either likeable, charming, or characters you can identify with at least a little bit."
Biohackers,"Yeah, very weird. I think they did that to sell the tc show as a 40 minute series and not a 30 one?
The production to netflix I mean."
Biohackers,Plus Netflix has to meet that EU content quota - and considering Brexit they'll have to fill the void that UK shows no longer counting towards the quota will leave.
Biohackers,"The first few episodes have a heavy teen drama feel to it but From the end of episode 3 and onward, things get way better. Biohackers was just so bloody cliche that I couldn't get into it. At least the society has an interesting and original plot"
Biohackers,Dude! You simply cannot mention that Netflix might scale back on British productions in favour of other European ones due to the combination of Brexit and the EU content quota. I offered a similar musing just the other week there and Redditors hit me with so many downvotes that I’ve only just got my posting privileges back!!!
Biohackers,"Well that's stupid, people are watching Contagion"
Biohackers,"Aren't any media/stuff related to outbreaks and pandemics super popular at the moment ? 

Hell Outbreak and Contagion are super popular movies now so I don't see how that would hurt this show to launch now."
Biohackers,I think Netflix is also planning ahead for Q4 of 2020 and Q1 of 2021 by postponing some of its shows that are done to fill the gap in those quarters that will be short on shows.  Since the ones in production now for those quarters have been suspended for the coronavirus pandemic.
Biohackers,there is no possible way people can forget and they should be not be anyways.
Biohackers,Don't mention the wa- virus!
Biohackers,Well media sources have already made sure we wont forget sooooo
Biohackers,"But Contagion is available. Watched it for the first time and it's seems to hit very very close to home...

Weird .."
Biohackers,"Man, if Resident Evil 3 is still coming in 2 weeks I think there's no need to worry about reminding people of the virus. More people will watch it since they're home and they're thinking about this regardless."
Biohackers,OH NO! IT MIGHT REMIND ME! OH WOE! OH MY!
Biohackers,"Very dumb. That said, people are stupid and might complain

Like corona beer basically crashed"
Biohackers,oh shit I can't believe I forgot about this global pandemic
Biohackers,Guess we won't see Amazon's **Utopia**  soon either ...
Biohackers,"Why were most comments simply went for this is a dumb. If you care to read the title and maybe also the article through translation, it doesn't seems dumb to me.

>> According to information from the media magazine DWDL.de - without revealing too much of the series' story - there are apparently some scenes, including the first scene of the first episode of ""Biohackers"", which could be disturbing against the background of the Coronavirus.

Highly implying the plot consisting virus creation by mean of human intervention, which is not a good idea to air right now."
Biohackers,"They aren't actually afraid it will ""remind viewers"". They are just afraid of backlash"
Biohackers,People are watching a load of pandemic movies. This would probably boost viewership of the series.
Biohackers,Plague inc's hitting record numbers as well.
Biohackers,"I'm guessing, they don't wanna cause panic?"
Biohackers,Actually their sales are up.
Biohackers,we really need to waive the 'tone deaf' argument in favor of understanding that many ppl watch & read stories that depict similar circumstances they're in to cope
Biohackers,Is it me or thier German accent sounds different than the one in dark?
Biohackers,I just finished the first season. What an absolute mind fuck of a show that was.
Biohackers,"Reminds me of Lonelygirl 15, minus the video blogs obviously."
Biohackers,Probably from a different part of Germany.
Biohackers,"They are from Switzerland, so they speak a very different dialect than normal Germans. In fact if German-Swiss people speak with each other it is mostly unintelligible to most German speakers."
Biohackers,"No they aren’t! Freiburg is verrry southern Germany, but the actors all have a general German accent (Hochdeutsch) and don’t speak in a regional accent or in Swiss German"
Biohackers,In the Series the People don’t have a Swiss accent but in this YouTube Video there are people with a Swiss accent since it is filmed at ETH Zurich.
Biohackers,"Sorry, my bad. I guess that’s what you get for not watching the video, I was looking around for peoples opinion on the show and came across your comment. Sorry!"
Biohackers,"I just finished it, all the episodes are like that. It's bizarre but it does bump up the running time considerably. So a thirty minute episode can now, technically, fit into a 42 minute time slot. That probably makes the show an easier sale to some markets or platforms.

I do prefer this method, credits are easy to skip, in fact just stop watching. An American show would've insisted on padding out the actual episodes with pointless side plots or long meaningful shots of the actors  staring into each others eyes. That would've been more difficult to skip and compromised the creative vision.

This is a good show, not really SF though. It was frustrating having to wait five episodes to learn the resolution of the very first scene, which I felt was a bit of a cheat, but I have to admit that it kept me watching."
Biohackers,Woo this was a fun ride! Surprised it’s not getting more attention. Really enjoyed it!!
Biohackers,"> I just finished it, all the episodes are like that. It's bizarre...

Copy that.

> I do prefer this method,

I don't.

>...credits are easy to skip, in fact just stop watching.

I'll only watch usually a portion of the credits if I am interested in a particular actor who I recognized but could not recall the name. I would have normally just stopped watching as the credits began to roll but when I looked down I saw that there was still about 10 minutes of film time left and I thought well that can't be right. Maybe there was going to be a preview of the next ep or maybe an after ep discussion but nope all credits.

I quickly stopped reading your third paragraph since I got the distinct impression you were commenting on the show since as you mentioned you had already finished and I was only through ep 2."
Biohackers,"From the looks of it. It looks like the project never got off the ground and quietly died behind the scenes. I got nothing related to Quinto on the project. But when I searched Chase Palmer (who was supposed to be the showrunner) it said that the show is in ""Pre-Production"". But it doesn't sound hopeful.

I did some research and the next tv show that Quinto is starring in is a supernatural show called: NOS42A2 (also based off a book), The premise sounds..Kind of amazing actually!:  ""*NOS4A2* follows ""Vic McQueen, a young working-class artist who discovers that she has a supernatural ability to track the seemingly immortal Charlie Manx (Quinto). Manx feeds off the souls of children, then deposits what remains of them into Christmasland — a twisted Christmas Village of Manx’s imagination where every day is Christmas Day and unhappiness is against the law. Vic must strive to defeat Manx and rescue his victims — without losing her mind or falling victim to him herself""."
Biohackers,That coffee commercial with George Clooney that shortens “Solsbury Hill” is not good.
Biohackers,"Sounds okay, but as a transhumanist I was really stoked to hear about a show about biohacking. Oh, well."
High Score,"It's a good detective show. The cast is good, the cases are serialized and develop naturally, and they nail the LA setting. It's not really like (or trying to be like) any of the shows you mentioned except maybe that it shares a similar approach to how seasons are structured with Dexter.

Never read the books personally but really enjoyed the show because it's just plain well made.

Also iMDB and RT's Tomatometer are terrible ways to assess what to watch next. iMDB is filled with impartial reviews from rabid fanbases that pump up or pump down things without much regard to quality of the content. And RT's Tomatometer is meant to show you how many people gave a thumbs up vs a thumbs down and with TV, it's often based on reviews of a handful of episodes only. RT does have an average score metric which for S1 of Bosch was 7.1 / 10. So basically exactly what you think it should be..."
High Score,"This may something to do with the books and the many fans of those. I know I enjoyed both, the books (the first of which came out in 1992 ) and the series, but, I'll admit it's likely geared more towards an older crowd."
High Score,"The show benefits from having a wealth of excellent source material. Comparing it to Murder She Wrote is asinine. You don't have to like it, but you could try a little harder with your criticisms OP."
High Score,"I have read all the books and I love the series. 
Titus will never not be Bosch to me now,even though in the books he’s older."
High Score,"It’s a solid show that knows what it is.  Honestly, I generally hate cop shows, but the characters in this one is really what drives it as it goes on.  I just generally like most of them and they do a good job of making it all feel just interesting and suspenseful enough.  It took me forever to get through the first season when it came out.  But once I got into two, I began enjoying them a lot more and would binge the later seasons.  There is a bit of charm to it, even if it is middling at times."
High Score,"> Am i missing something? 

No, there is no hidden meaning or some magical equation you need to solve

> Does it get better?

If you didn't like the first season the show is probably not for you

>  Is it just me?

Am I the only one on the planet that doesn't like tomatoes? No probably not.

Why is everyone treating ratings like some magical list that determines with 100% accuracy what you would like? I don't like metal music, but just because someone rates a metal album a 10/10 doesn't make me think I would like it.

Ratings are subjective. In this case the average viewer rates it 8.5 on IMDB, and you just fall outside that average. It is just not for you, move on, you don't like it. There is nothing wrong with that."
High Score,Dad’s love it
High Score,"It’s definitely better after season one and the rather poor serial killer storyline, but it just sounds like you don’t like it. That’s okay. No reason to force yourself to watch something. No way I’d watch 10 episodes of something if I felt as you did. Fuck that. Way too much other stuff to watch."
High Score,"IMDB is pretty useless, and RT% for TV are very polarized, especially as a show gets into later seasons.

Movie critics see basically every major release, but TV critics don't watch as much so they end up covering stuff that's  up their alley, and they also probably won't continue to review it if they don't like it. So since RT% is a binary good/bad, if 97% of critics agrees with your assessment that it's a 7/10, it'll have the 97% score it has.

I prefer Metacritic for TV, which has a 7.3 score for Bosch, though it shows 32 positive reviews, 3 mixed, and 0 negative. So it seems like your opinion is shared by most critics."
High Score,So it being rated 1.5 higher than your own rating made you this mad? Jeez
High Score,"You're right, we actually all just love Titus Welliver so we're giving it higher credentials to keep him employed."
High Score,"A lof people like the procedural cop series, where its a different baddie or situation every week. I personally don't like it, even if there are underlying plot threads. 

I've just noticed a lot of people gravitate to towards this format, maybe its just easier to jump into or takes less effort to keep up with. Not sure, there's a lot of similar shows to Bosch that have really high scores with a similar format. Like justified and banshee, which I don't were bad, but I personally didn't feel they deserved their 8+ ratings on IMDb"
High Score,"I agree it's not great tv. It's like, better than a standard network show but below most good premium programs."
High Score,"> Just got through the first season and I am really trying to give this show a chance but holy crap it is mediocre. With a score on IMDB 8,5 and Rotten tomatoes 97%,

I have never understood the love the show gets. It never rises above a standard a CBS cop show. It does have great opening credits."
High Score,"I agree. It was just extremely mediocre to me. Kinda felt like paint by numbers. I guess it’s fine if you’re a fan of the genre, but nothing special."
High Score,"Some people like fairly generic cop/detective stuff.  There is a reason that some cliches become cliches.  Bosch is more well acted than most generic cop stuff.  I'm sure if the Lincoln Lawyer (a similiar mediocre law drama written by the same author in the same universe) had as good of an actor in the lead,  it would also be  getting 8.5s."
High Score,"It’s slow af, but it has its moments. I’m watching the last season mostly out of habit."
High Score,"It's not spectacular, but it's a consistently solid show if you like the genre. Definitely not on the same level as the likes of True Detective or The Wire, though. If you didn't care for the first season, it's probably not your cup of tea; it doesn't really change in any significant way in later seasons."
High Score,"For sure,  this is the gap that I find hard to bridge. I did not read the books so I'm going in blind. Perhaps I should read the books and give it another go?"
High Score,"I say this every time someone posts about how they don't understand how ??? gets high ratings, or why ???? does not. It's called opinions, of which we all have our very own individual tastes about tv, movies, sports, food, other humans...."
High Score,"7.3 seems way more appropriate  
Seeing the comments it looks like it has an emotionally invested fanbase because of the books its based on.  
I am also seeing now that Amazon owns IMDB and Bosch is on prime so maybe that has something to do with it. although it has been around since 2014 so I dunno.   
Ill go to Metacritic from now on I think, cheers"
High Score,"I guess for me the difference between a 7 and an 8 is huge  
I expect the difference between a 4 and 5 to be more or less the same.  
if you think of it like a graph it would be gradual and then very steep   
Getting an 8 or more should be reserved for the best of the best."
High Score,Bosch isn't a procedural of the week show at all - have you even watched it? It is a serialized stories with most cases taking place over the course of a full season and some taking multiple seasons.
High Score,"ye this makes a lot of sense, good comparisons.  
I do think its very watchable I just expected more for its score."
High Score,"ye that is fair , I can see it being a background show for sure."
High Score,"Or just read the books and forget the series. :) I get it and to be honest although I enjoyed it, I find Titus Wellivers style a little starchy and over contained. That and I have never met a series or movie that lived up to the written work."
High Score,"The best of the best is an...8? Your whole post really, you use a very abnormal scale that no one else does."
High Score,So I think the problem isn't with the rating but that you don't know how scales work
High Score,"https://www.dictionary.com/e/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/57.jpg

High Score,"well 8 **and upwards** is like an A if you think about it like a grading system  
Im basically describing a [bellcurve](https://blog.moertel.com/images/public_html/pix/20060114/ecdf-all-catwoman.png)"
High Score,"Well if you've seen through S3 or S4, you've gotten the gist of the show. No issues with me if you just don't like it, my only point was it definitely is not a case-of-the-week procedural."
High Score,"finally someone putting it in terms i can understand ;)  
good show"
High Score,WTF was with that guy using his metal detector in a cemetary. Am I the only one who thinks that's in incredibly poor taste?
High Score,The political correct cancer is so out-of-place and shoe horned it made me hate the LBGT movement.
High Score,Honestly the Didyouknow? Video game history channel on youtube is more informative and interesting. I thought this would have been a “game per episode” documentary style series but it lacks cohesiveness.
High Score,It’s not too bad.  But brushes over a fair bit as well.  I do wish they went into more of the console war story in episode 4 and added some of the Sony story to it instead of it being Nintendo vs Sega
High Score,So far the series has been almost as much about politics and diversity as it has been about video games.
High Score,"I’m pretty disappointed in it, tbh. All over the place, not covering a lot. I think they could have given each episode an extra 20-30 mins."
High Score,It’s very thin. I was excited when it came up in my queue. But it is just really boring and lacking in interesting facts/info. I wish they had spent less money on flashy graphics/effects and spent more time getting captivating interviews and doing legitimate research. Also the narration and editing felt really repetitive and disjointed. Would not recommend.
High Score,"This went out a few years ago and was also good, if you're into that sort of thing.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32wN4IIDW1o"
High Score,It's a terrible documentary.
High Score,I never seen documentary about such interesting topic done so boring.
High Score,"I think people are right in how this series definitely does not compare to even something like what you see from The Gaming Historian or The Video Game Years in terms of actually teaching about games and the culture around them. Hell, the RPG episode focused more on point and click adventure games and did not once mention Dragon Quest as an important JRPG (not that Final Fantasy is unimportant, but DQ came first).

But... I don't think hardcore gamers are really the audience for this series. In the few episodes I've seen I can say I've learned very few new things, but this is perfect for my dad who grew up with the NES and knows the famous games they're talking about. Having people in it like Hirokazu Tanaka and Roberta Williams are pretty deep dives for someone like him (even I wouldn't have thought to have Tanaka to be honest, but he was a good choice)."
High Score,It feels like somebody reading wikipedia entries for most of it and brushes over things too fast.
High Score,But does it speak of Intellivision?
High Score,"France Costrel has an obvious agenda and Im pretty tired of media pushing their message at the expense of proper storytelling- this felt like the other side of the coin of those military-recruitment propaganda movies. A diversity quota is just as disingenuous and misleading as producing only white story subjects for a culturally diverse market... 

Just go make a doc about the growing diversity and accessibility in gaming of both designers and gamers, I'd watch that too"
High Score,"So I was hoping this would at least Match the Toys that made Us show. Not to deep but full of nostalgia and great talking heads. 

Two episodes in and this show pales in comparison. Has similar visual cues and style from the Toys Doc but is all over the place in terms of weird stories vs actual gaming history"
High Score,"It's good and I didn't know about some of the stories so was educational for me but I do agree with the other comments that it should have been a game per episode

The pac-man and e.t stories from the first episode could have each been their own episode.

Only watched the first two episodes so far but so we have had three episodes worth
1 pac-man
2 e.t
3 super mario"
High Score,"I was super upset about how they painted adventure games as inferior RPGs. They're different genres trying to do different things.

They also implied high def graphics were ""better"" than early era /pixel art games when theyre not ""better"" just different."
High Score,"I got an episode and a half in before Netflix kicked me off in favor of another screen, but my first impression is... not great. 

It barely goes into the history of anything. It’s more or less a series of anecdotes and while that can be interesting in a field that is more widely known, there still has not been a well-produced and comprehensive video game history documentary. It also just completely glosses over a lot of interesting facts in favor of just rushing into the next brief interview. 

The MIT story about the development of Ms. Pac-Man, for example, was so rushed that it may as well not have even been included. They didn’t even say the words “Crazy Otto” once. I understand that not everything can be covered in such thorough detail, but why even have a focus on the arcade modders if you aren’t going to do their story justice? There are a thousand things that happened in the era covered in the first episode that would have been more interesting to see. 

I liked the Fairchild Channel F mention, but it was very bare-bones and didn’t even really show any of the console’s games. On top of that, they didn’t even mention the Odyssey (the first “real” console) or the Atari 2600’s competitors. They didn’t even mention the struggles at Atari that led to the founding of Activision, which would have been both interesting and timely given that it was a story rooted in poor working conditions and a lack of a union to ensure the developers got proper credit. Then, it made the most glaring mistake in essentially pinning the crash of 1983 on the developer of ET. Nowhere did it mention the numerous porn games and other shitty rush jobs that plagued the industry at the time. The first episode felt more like an Atari-sponsored fluff piece than anything with real insight. 

The focus on competitions is weird, too. I get that the series is titled High Score, but there’s enough there to have made a completely separate series about the history of esports and frankly it gets in the way of interesting development stories. The second episode mentioned that the NES had its initial US launch in New York, and then immediately pushes ahead four years to the Nintendo World Championship tournament. It was extremely jarring and completely skipped over huge amounts of interesting history. 

I like the smaller stories they focus on, but again, they would be much more engaging if this were a supplement to a broader documentary about the actual history behind any of these companies. When you gloss over the success of the NES’ launch and shift focus to the game counselors program, it’s just unsatisfying. This series brushes with a lot of interesting subjects and goes nowhere with any of them. 

I’m honestly extremely disappointed that Netflix produced it in this way. I would rather them either do a more serious study of the history, or something like The Toys That Made Us that just focuses on one major game per episode. Instead we’ve gotten this weird half-step that doesn’t offer anything new to people that are already familiar with the subject and is also way too niche to appeal to a general audience. This is an absolute failure of a documentary."
High Score,"I really loved the show but each episode could have been double the length. They delve into the history, tech and people be each age/genre, but not deep enough in some areas. 

For example Ep3 deals with the birth of RPGs and features interviews with Richard Garriott, creator of Ultima, but totally skips over the online universe and that he ruled over it as the all powerful Lord British

Aside from some minor quibbles, mostly around wanting more, these are great documentaries."
High Score,On episode 3 huge spoiler. Sephiroth kills Aeris
High Score,Generous to call this a documentary when it keeps sacrificing info for laughs.
High Score,Just saw this on my to watch list and I’m kinda excited to see it! I’m glad to hear good things so far.
High Score,I saw video game docuseries and I was sold.
High Score,"Reminds me a little of the Toys documentary and the recent Movies doc that Netflix put out. 

This is better than those, but still, the actual execution is subpar. Silly jokes, and disorganized structure.  Just chooses random stories to do deep dives into.

It's fine, but still disappointing cause these really interesting subjects deserve a solid showing, and they probably won't get one now."
High Score,we liked ep 1
High Score,What is the title of the Power Glove song that is used in the intro?
High Score,"I'm almost finished with the series and they got some good interviews, but like in 'the toys that made us' and such, they didnt get hitters in those communities to explain things. Like they have Andre (Black Nerd) from Youtube help explain Power Rangers because he's one of the big PR guys. This doc series had some good info and interviews, but it is quickly touched on. It would have been great to get the DYKG and Gaming Historian guys or Metal Jesus Rocks type people to hype up some of the points or give insight. I was expecting to see James Rolfe (AVGN) to be in the ET ep since the creator was in his movie and such. A missed opportunity for a doc that had some good points, but also rushed points. Another good example is the man who made the first cartridge is a cool story, but it's rushed over with few details, and I'm left without enough info to fully understand what happened in that situation."
High Score,Does ANYONE know what the display board they use in the Pacman meeting is called??
High Score,"Loved seeing Tom Kalinske and his 5 step plan to beat Nintendo especially #5. Make Fun of Nintendo...checked out his Twitter to see if he spoke about Sega a lot. Unfortunately its mostly anti-Trump tweets. No point in following him since I just stick to retro gaming on my Twitter page.

Also never knew Madden 95 was the first football game to feature black players. Pretty cool!"
High Score,The guy on episode 4 looks like he didn't mature past the age 17... which is a shame cause he looked cool as teen. Matter of fact all the fans they interviewed were a bit weird. Couldn't they of got Xavier Woods or something?
High Score,"Could anyone tell me what the game shown at 37:04 episode 3 is, right before BotW scene?"
High Score,Is it interesting for the general population or just a nerd documentary?
High Score,"Lol i was wondering the same thing.  

Isn't this guy just grave digging?"
High Score,"Im late to reply but not only did this Doc suck, but each episode had an obligatory Netflix ""woke"" quota. Felt so forced."
High Score,I also really like The Gaming Historian on YouTube. He puts out so much content and his most recent stuff is shot so well it’s basically a documentary all it’s own.
High Score,"> lacks cohesiveness 

Yea I hate the jumping around on the timeline. For a viewer who doesn’t already know this history, it is a very confusing to keep track of the chronology of the tech development."
High Score,https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyS4xQE6DK4_p3qXQwJQAyA
High Score,"Agreed, I kept waiting for the documentary to start. Are we going to see how they produced the music and got it to fit on the NES? Or see how Nintendo localized their American branding? Or how a kid trained for a video game competition? No, you don't, they just go on to the next interview.

It felt like having small talk with a coworker and realizing that you are none the wiser after 30 minutes of chatting. Some people like those charming conversations and that is cool. But had I known that it was a bricolage of testimonies I would've just nodded and kept scrolling."
High Score,"There's still that series in the works about the ""Console Wars"", from Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg."
High Score,"I was waiting for that as well but it really only focused on the early 90s when that was the absolute console war. Sony and Nintendo didn't fall out until what, 94 after the Nintendo CD fell through? PlayStation was a 95 release, and that's about as far as they went in the show with Madden 95 which again, was a bigger deal at the time. I remember immediately going with PlayStation along with just about everyone else but it wasn't a rivalry like Sega and Nintendo, and by the time the Saturn came out, nobody really gave a shit about Sega anyone. They mostly made crappy arcade games at that point, and those were quickly falling out too once console versions were better."
High Score,I loved it too. But I was also waiting for... Pokémon?!? I was born in 1991 for reference. Idk Pokémon was my into to gaming that I’m still into today 😬
High Score,I kind of enjoyed it as someine with no knowledge about the history. I kiked how the ending of each episode was a sneak peak into the end.
High Score,"Oh god is it boring. When they did the gaming championship in the first episode I thought ""okay, sure"" but then they kept going back to these competitive players in every episode and by the time they got to Chris Tang I was cringing. I totally skipped through whoever the Street Fighter champion was because I could see my GF slowly losing interest and we didn't bother with any more episodes after that.

They just missed out on so much stuff; barely touched on the Game Boy, briefly alluded to the Game Gear only to never return to it, no SMB3, only briefly talked about the SNES, so much stuff that wasn't included yet spent an ungodly amount of time talking about Night Trap."
High Score,This was a good watch! Thanks for sharing
High Score,Charlie Brooker is the best. Doesn't he work for Netflix now?
High Score,">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32wN4IIDW1o

I definitely appreciate links like these that have fallen through the cracks of my attention."
High Score,"The RPG episode spent half the time talking about Gayblade.  Literally a nothing game that influenced nothing. Then they talked about the aids crisis for some reason, then about evil religious Republicans then the episode just ended. They didn't mention dragon quest... Terrible."
High Score,"I honestly was waiting for more final fantasy lol. I get that the early text/point and click started it, but can any other game really even try to claim it had more influence making RPGs popular? Not that DQ wasn't huge either. They were showing clips of every other game I was almost getting pissed until they brought amano on. For like 5 minutes and then they just moved right on. The docu has good points and bad, but they really skipped over some major points that they themselves brought up just to move on to mullet Mike, the human strategy guide or something else that could have all been stuffed into a separate episode for cool stories that weren't as important."
High Score,"No, it does not. Doesn’t mention the ColecoVision, either. It doesn’t even talk about the Magnavox Odyssey. The most obscure it’s gotten from what I’ve seen is the Fairchild Channel F, and even that it didn’t go into much detail about."
High Score,I wonder if more people would notice the agenda pushing if the 10 minute lgb segment of every episode was replaced with the benefits of strict veganism.
High Score,I don’t even know if they need to double the episodes. Just take out the stories about kids winning competitions. I don’t understand why they are interviewing a kid who practiced Tetris non stop for hours to win a Tetris competition. Save that for the history of eSports doc.
High Score,The first two episodes I thought were solid after that is starts dipping in quality.
High Score,"The story about the first cartridge was terrible, it seemed like his kids had no idea about any specifics of his actual experiences, which is fair but it made for a terrible segment. Plus when the daughter showed her kid a picture of him, it was just his picture that's been circulated on reddit printed on computer paper, it did not come off as genuine at all."
High Score,Good question. It seems to go for more general audiences. Another comment mentioned the “dad who remembered Pac Man from the 80’s” is most specifically who it’s going for. Video game nerds will probably already know a lot of the info.
High Score,Thank you kind sir.
High Score,"Yeah some of those parts were kind of interesting especially the bits and pieces with the likes of Tom Kalinski and the developer of ET.  But some of the others went on for way too long and just felt out of place.  

It was trying to be both a documentary and tell stories but didn’t excel at either.  Would constantly mention little things like getting things to fit on cartridges and then suddenly jump to something else and never come back to the previous item."
High Score,but its going to be on CBS All Access -_-
High Score,"> I was waiting for that as well but it really only focused on the early 90s when that was the absolute console war. Sony and Nintendo didn't fall out until what, 94 after the Nintendo CD fell through? PlayStation was a 95 release, and that's about as far as they went

True, it just seemed like a massive waste to have Tom Kalinski as such a small part of the story and the success of Sega in Sega v Nintendo without then going into at least some of the things that led to the demise of Sega in the console market"
High Score,He created Black Mirror on Netflix.
High Score,My thoughts exactly while watching. Good old Netflix checking their boxes. The fact that they didn't even mention Dragon Quest is just insulting to the topic IMO.
High Score,"I actually don't mind that they wanted to spend time talking about Gayblade, but the episode should have been at least 20 minutes longer to compensate. Because doing otherwise could get them in this weird situation where if they try to make an episode about, say, important LGBTQ games, then they're running the risk of having people be upset that they're singling those games out, instead of just treating them the same as these other important games. Ultimately, the show should be telling the story of defining games in each genre, and not taking time to talk about arguably the progenitor of the JRPG is a complete disservice."
High Score,[deleted]
High Score,If you don’t mention Miyazaki you have failed at representing rpg games.
High Score,"> but can any other game really even try to claim it had more influence making RPGs popular? Not that DQ wasn't huge either.

Sorry for this random and late reply; I just finished the series and found this thread through a search haha. FF was well-liked early on, but it wasn't until FF7 came along that the series became a cultural icon and popularized RPGs in the west. In terms of the genre as a whole, DQ is, without question, **the** series that influenced and popularized console RPGs, and there's nothing gameplay-wise the original FF did that the first two DQ games hadn't already established first. Concerning reach, FF1 and 2 combined [didn't even sell more than the very first DQ game did](https://vgsales.fandom.com/wiki/Best_selling_Square-Enix_games#NES), let alone DQ3.

FF is certainly a historically significant series, but mostly because of what came much later. *High Score* implying it had significant impact for console RPGs in the late 80s is misleading at best."
DeMarcus Family Rules,"Is it as funny, for instance, as This Country?"
DeMarcus Family Rules,I loved this show and binged it all in a day. I hope they make more as really got into the characters but the end and was genuinely funny throughout
DeMarcus Family Rules,Yes. Pretty mildly funny stuff. Looking forward to season 2. Short 6 episodes so one can be done with it on a Saturday.
DeMarcus Family Rules,Any form of organized religion is a big turn-off for me so I avoided it.
DeMarcus Family Rules,Just for balance I think Daisy May Cooper is brilliant and This Country to be one of the great UK comedies of recent year. I only watched the first episode of Everyone Else Burns and don’t think I laughed once.
DeMarcus Family Rules,"I don't find Daiy May Cooper funny in the slightest, so this is funnier.

This show isn't really about the humour, though. It's a comedy, but the jokes are very subtle (for the most part).

This is about the average level of humour throughout the show:

DeMarcus Family Rules,Power Rangers if just Big Bad Beetleborgs in different constumes.

DeMarcus Family Rules,Wow. No one ever said that before…
DeMarcus Family Rules,Yellowstone is just succession with cowboys. Bunch of spoiled privilege brat children fighting each other for daddy’s approval

DeMarcus Family Rules,"I was ready to laugh in your face because I was expecting ""quality wise""

but Succession is Shakespeare with American CEOs instead of English kings, princes and vassals"
DeMarcus Family Rules,"So basically succession, HOTD, Yellowstone as well as countless political or palace intrigue shows are basically the same rehased stories with different settings..

I'm not familiar with most of these, and I watch a shit-ton of TV and movies. I really like the effort, and the writeups are perfect in length.


Again, not knowing these a lot, is Severance the highest ranked English speaking show? (Nothing against non English speakers of course) 


Also, I'm guessing most of these are straight drama? Language and genre might both be useful things to put in parenthesis for anyone else unfamiliar.


Totally agree with the couple from White Lotus being great characters, I much preferred season 1 (which seems like a hot take) but those two, specifically the woman, were very interesting characters to me."
DeMarcus Family Rules,"How you pick what to watch? I’m overwhelmed with all these shows in Netflix and I always seem to pick the limited series or those talked about in reddit, especially regarding to the foreign shows or K dramas. There isn’t much write-ups or reviews in English."

..................

I didn't like what 2022 television had to offer for the most part. One too many disappointments for me as well. I mean I watched a lot more shows than I did in 2021, yet struggled to find 25 new shows for this list. But I do think my top 13 here are genuinely great.But anyways, thanks a lot for reading, even if you just scrolled through this lol. Same time, same place, next year? ❤️"
DeMarcus Family Rules,"Neat list.  A lot of shows I've not seen.

A few shows from 2022 I'd recommend if you haven't seen em:

- Black Bird

- SAS Rogue Heroes

- The Offer

- Under the Banner of Heaven"
DeMarcus Family Rules,Recency bias but I just finished Yellowjackets and really had a great time watching it.
DeMarcus Family Rules,No Atlanta? Both seasons last year were incredible
DeMarcus Family Rules,Pachinko is the most slept on series of 2022
DeMarcus Family Rules,"1. She hulk
2. Ted lasso
3. Ms Marvel
4. Harley Quinn show
5. Lord of the rings
6. Spy x family 
7. Chainsaw man
8. Loki
9. Mob psycho
10. Hot D"
DeMarcus Family Rules,Which ones did you see? 🤔 amma take a wild guess and say The Bear and Severance?
DeMarcus Family Rules,"> is Severance the highest ranked English speaking show?

Yes. Even though Pachinko got a bit of english too. 

> I'm guessing most of these are straight drama? Language and genre might both be useful things to put in parenthesis for anyone else unfamiliar.

Yea. And yea I should probably do that next time."
DeMarcus Family Rules,"i just read the synopsis and glance at the preview a bit sometimes just to check visual/production quality. if it looks like something that could be potentially great, i check it out."
DeMarcus Family Rules,🙂💕
DeMarcus Family Rules,It’s great but it’s depressing.
DeMarcus Family Rules,"What other new anime from 2022 did you think were great? 

Anime for me in 2022 was, *meh* tbh. I didn't like Summertime Rendering much and Chainsaw Man hasn't gotten to the good parts of the manga yet. I was suppose to see Bocchi The Rock! before making this list, but ended up getting an ear infection so couldn't."
DeMarcus Family Rules,I'd count Yellowjackets as 2021 TV show.
DeMarcus Family Rules,on the other version of this list pinned on my profile.
DeMarcus Family Rules,"Nice! Do you often give the pilot a go before fully committed to the whole season? Any shows that you have given up midpoint? 


Like I tried to start Warrior Nun because the trailer seems fun and the lead actress looks very beautiful, also being afraid of it being cancelled (it indeed got cancelled then), but have given up after episode 6 or 7… cause the plot is very weak and the characters are laughable.


And then I tried to pick the ones that got high ratings in imdb, and started watching Extraordinary Attorney Woo and I do like it so far! Although sometimes being too cheesy at times, the acting is excellent and the stories are well-written. Highly recommended."
DeMarcus Family Rules,"Dropped Summertime after 5 minutes lol.

But personally, Bocchi the Rock is incredible TV and is my #1 show of any medium this year. And I'm not even usually into anime comedies. It's just that good, glad you're gonna try it! I'm an Attack on Titan fan after the massive story shift in Season 3, and S4P2 aired at the start of the year, although personally I don't like rating something that isn't an entire season.

Otherwise Chainsaw Man would be a decent pick even if, as you said, it hasn't quite gotten to what makes it special yet. Cyberpunk Edgerunners is one that would be worth watching and has near universal praise, and my other 2 shows to hit a 9 were Kaguya S3 (but it's not everyone), and Paripi Koumei, which I thought was an extremely passionate show but it might hit as a 7-8 for others. 

From your list I probably have to watch the 2 seasons of Tatami though. I had no idea it was well regarded I never looked into it!

Other than that though, yea there was a lot of meh. Spy Family went from potentially great to just average as it went on, LycoRyco got a lot of hype but was merely good not great (needed some writing cleanup). Personally though Dress up Darling was ok at best, and Gundam and To Your Eternity were massive disappointments"
DeMarcus Family Rules,Ignoring some great sequels I thought Chainsaw man was awesome even if it hadn't gotten to some of the good parts  of the manga. And I really liked summertime rendering (although I haven't seen the last few episodes). Lycoris recoil was fun. Spy X Family was great.
DeMarcus Family Rules,Oh my bad. I’m late to the party.
DeMarcus Family Rules,"> Do you often give the pilot a go before fully committed to the whole season?

I give everything at least 4 episodes before I decided whether it's working for me or not. Unless it's *reeeeeeeaaaaally* bad... then I quit after the 2nd or 3rd. But that rarely happens. That has only happened like 4 times in the past 3 years. 

> Any shows that you have given up midpoint?

A shit ton. 

> Extraordinary Attorney

I was suppose to watch this show too but unfortunately didn't have time for it. There are some great shows coming out of korea nowadays (3 are on this list too lol), but they require commitment with those lengthy episode counts and runtime. 

I recommend ""**D.P.**"" on netflix too if you haven't seen it. That's another outstanding one."
DeMarcus Family Rules,"> Bocchi the Rock is incredible TV and is my #1 show of any medium this year. And I'm not even usually into anime comedies. It's just that good

damn. guess i gotta hurry and check this one out now. lol."
DeMarcus Family Rules,"You should check out Kotaro Lives Alone, such a good show!"
DeMarcus Family Rules,"Heard good reviews about DP but I haven’t managed to watch it, with season 2 coming this year I may watch it soon!

For other Korean shows I watched My Name, Hellbound and of course Squid Game in 2021, which were all very good. Narco-Saints, The Glory and Somebody are shows I saved in 2022 but not started yet."
DeMarcus Family Rules,I did hear about it! I'll add it to my list thanks!
DeMarcus Family Rules,"Misunderstandings played for drama, especially in romantic plots, theres always some contrivance for why they can’t just talk it out"
DeMarcus Family Rules,"> 
    Villains making others do their dirty work instead of doing it themselves.


Thats smart actually"
DeMarcus Family Rules,"Not eating/drinking something that just arrived in a diner. Like a detective gets a call about a body, breakfast arrives and he just leaves. Dude, just fucking eat it, the stiff isnt going nowhere. And not like anyone knows about it, you can always lie there was traffic or something and just sit there and eat. Pisses me off so much"
DeMarcus Family Rules,I like villains that are actual people who maybe care about a cause or the environment but then they do something crazy because of it.
DeMarcus Family Rules,Love triangles.
DeMarcus Family Rules,Iso
DeMarcus Family Rules,"Working class people who are stupid/tragic/mean/lazy/slobs/fools. Some people have managed to write good roles for normal working folk, but most writers just don’t manage to get it right, so they revert to stereotypes."
DeMarcus Family Rules,"Changing character personality traits or circumstances in adaptions to generate more interpersonal drama and unnecessary tension/conflict than there was in the source material, I guess so it plays better for TV?

These characters get along fine in the book/comic/game/whatever, but TV writers always have to find an excuse to have everyone butt heads all the time."
DeMarcus Family Rules,"I don't know if it's a trope but I hate when the main character is such a good person that they help the bad guys because main character will always do the right thing. and then those bad guys kill people and everyone's like ""don't blame yourself"". so annoying."
DeMarcus Family Rules,"1. Something happens in the beginning of of the episode and then it just jumps back xx hours/days/weeks before said event. 
2. Character is absolutely broke, but still drinks in a bar and pays the tab."
DeMarcus Family Rules,"\>6. Villains imprisoning the hero(es) instead of killing them when they have no reason to keep them alive.  
  
At least one glaring example of that in Witcher: Blood Origin, where a skilled unarmed+weapons master is led away for execution with no restraints and minimal guards.

\>20. The themes, “If you kill them, you’re no better than them” 

Oh hell yeah. Especially when not killing them is sometimes much worse. Like if they can't be captured or detained reliably and can be expected to kill more people.

My own ones are

A-Team Firing. Bullets are flying everything at fairly close ranges, but no one is getting hit, or at least none of the named characters. Also when the heroes are being strafed by a chopper or plane and the bullets follow a path to their left and right. And car chases where the hero's car has absorbed its own weight in bullets but no occupants or critical components were hit.

Melee where the fighters are happily trading punches, but as soon as one of them picks up a knife or sword, the other fighter gains a 100% dodge buff.

World-ending stakes. If you set the stakes too high,  the audience won't believe you'll follow through and destroy the world or kill the entire cast. Smaller stakes are better."
DeMarcus Family Rules,"1. A waitress (or any minimum-wage worker) living in a $3,500 a month loft in the city.
2. A 5'2"", 105 lb. female cop beating the crap out of a bad guy built like an NFL lineman.
3. Cops in a 10-minute firefight in the middle of a crowded public space not having to spend the rest of their career filling out paperwork.
4. People ordering food and/or drinks and never paying for them."
DeMarcus Family Rules,Do you even like any tropes? This is an absurdly long list
DeMarcus Family Rules,"People getting up apparently two hours before they have to leave in the morning, acting relaxed in the morning instead of everyone rushing out of the house."
DeMarcus Family Rules,"1 - cops, doctors or X agents on 45 hours shifts/missions with no sleep at all and still being super quippy, verbose and athletic at the end of it. Yep, sure

2 - men the size of small Zamboni trucks getting carpeted by women whose arms are thinner than Italian breadsticks. Yep, sure

3 - this is also in movies: people walk into the boss' office with a stack sized pile of documents, boss flips the first two pages, makes a ""oh shit"" face and immediately understands everything. Yep, sure"
DeMarcus Family Rules,Weird...
DeMarcus Family Rules,"The way someone in a restaurant or diner will just throw some money on the table and leave. Is that still a thing in USA? Seems dodgy 

And I absolutely déteste the trope shot of a woman disappearing out of the bottom of the frame whilst the camera stays on the man’s face to film his reaction signifying oral sex. Awful."
DeMarcus Family Rules,Murder...unless it happens in the last half
DeMarcus Family Rules,"* the only canon autistic characters over 18 basically being the kind of archetype Sheldon's a caricature of

* when what's needed to take down a regime in a dystopian series or fulfill some prophecy or w/e on a fantasy series somehow ends up making it so the male and female lead falling in love is key to saving the world

* when it feels like sitcom premises were created from the punny title and then no one bothered to put as much effort into the show"
DeMarcus Family Rules,[deleted]
DeMarcus Family Rules,"I can see it being smart as a way to not be caught for their crimes, yeah."
DeMarcus Family Rules,I too have wondered why that always happens.
DeMarcus Family Rules,"Yep. Gotta love character development, positive or negative!"
DeMarcus Family Rules,They’re the worst.
DeMarcus Family Rules,?
DeMarcus Family Rules,"Ahh, like the village love triangle added to the Wheel of Time TV show, plus the added and killed off wife of Perrin."
DeMarcus Family Rules,"Yep. If the hero lets the bad guy go free instead of facing whatever punishment they were due, and more people die as a result, that's on the hero as well."
DeMarcus Family Rules,"Some of us do that on purpose, so we don't have to go from zero-to-panic in the morning.  When I worked hourly jobs, I never understood the guys who would rush in thirty seconds before start time and then act like they couldn't understand why I would start the day so much more prepared.  It's like, five minutes, guys, and normal things like ""hanging up your coat"" won't feel like a race against time."
DeMarcus Family Rules,">3 - this is also in movies: people walk into the boss' office with a stack sized pile of documents, boss flips the first two pages, makes a ""oh shit"" face and immediately understands everything. Yep, sure

First or second page of a report usually has an executive summary for exactly that reason."
DeMarcus Family Rules,What’s weird?
DeMarcus Family Rules,"Leaving money on the table and leaving is definitely a thing in Hong Kong, even when sharing the table or booth with other patrons. I've done it in the US, too, and have not seen complaints from my US friends or the servers/managers."
DeMarcus Family Rules,Officer making a interview to a child without a parent is not a good idea. And end it is a very good idea.
DeMarcus Family Rules,"It's because of practical production issues. It's incredibly impractical to keep re-shooting the same scene over and over and have maybe 3 different scenes in a day where the character eats, if the actors actually eats properly during filming. They'd feel sick (and I guess there could also be inconsistency in scenes if they film it from different sides and half a pancake is missing in one shot but not in the next, et cetera).

I understand this but still can't help but feel annoyed every time I see it. XD"
DeMarcus Family Rules,I hate Isotropes on TV. A play on words.
DeMarcus Family Rules,"But not the whole family, or teenagers."
DeMarcus Family Rules,"So you decide how much you pay or tip? There’s no negotiation and no interaction of getting mmmm receiving change from your k
Total? Seems like you are wasting a lot of money."
DeMarcus Family Rules,"I love ""Castle"" but its so fucking blatantly obvious they are ""drinking"" from empty coffee mugs. FFS"
DeMarcus Family Rules,Why not? I've been that way all my life. I've known families who were like that.
DeMarcus Family Rules,"The servers leave the bill/cheque, expecting you to pay it at your leisure. In Hong Kong, the norm in those shops is to leave the bill immediately after receiving your food -- if not earlier -- or upon request -- ""bill, please!"". One can pay and leave on the table. No tips in Hong Kong. If change is needed, one can wait for a server, or bring directly to the cashier. This is for efficiency: HK restaurants are small; if everyone went to the cashier, there would be a big line that could block flow of traffic. If everyone waited for server, then new clients may not get their orders in, or their food in time, could be a back-up in the kitchen, etc. 

In US where I've lived, many restaurants with this norm will deposit the bill after asking if you will have anything else -- ""Just pay it when you're ready"" -- or upon request. If one is paying with a card, one will need to flag down the staff, of course, but if one has cash, then the total is there; one adds the gratuity to it as desired. Not every restaurant is this way, but those which are seem rather consistently so."
DeMarcus Family Rules,"This was such a well thought out post! I just finished watching the finale and was pretty much as lost at the end as I was throughout this show. Your 3 possibilities helped make sense of it a bit, as well as the whole “save point” analogy. I do wish they had spent a little time explaining the whole world a bit. There’s a lot to be said for “show don’t tell” but it was a bit impenetrable."
DeMarcus Family Rules,[deleted]
DeMarcus Family Rules,"For sure, it's one of those shows where I have to pay close attention the entire time and compile possible theories in my head to continuously test against new evidence, foreshadowing, and elements as they come along. But I really like that kind of show hahaha, I'm the kind of nerd who has rewatched Fringe numerous times to check and see how the plot holds up. As I thought, air tight. 

Also I'm used to reading scifi as dense and convoluted as this, so it's fun when a TV show really goes all in like a novel you know?"
DeMarcus Family Rules,"Ok, I dig it. Good expansion on the theorization. I hadn't considered the possibility that the haptics built in 2023 with future London intervention were advanced enough to perform all the functions of the implants in future London. Good catch. So, maybe Burton died from the device interacting with the haptics for too long, leading to Flynne putting it on herself and developing the bacterium, so Aelita is HER child/grandchild not Burton's? In which case it's wonderfully scifi tropetastic that she is romantically entangled with her descendant's adopted sibling. Juuust riding the edge of acceptably weird if you're a weird nerd. 

Either way, I'm still latched onto the idea that the infection that lead to the Klept wiping out the camps is somehow related to the data storing bacterium Flynne's got. If they end up cancelling it I'll just read the book (I normally do first in any case, but I enjoyed the first few episodes so much I didn't want to spoil it by reading the story by the time I knew it was one of Gibson's modern books). I must know how everything connects. The show laid out a great puzzle, clear enough to guess the shapes but not filled in enough to see exactly how it is completed."
DeMarcus Family Rules,"There are reasons [GRRM regularly rewatches the show](https://georgerrmartin.com/notablog/2020/09/10/c-c-claudius-aka-i-clavdivs/).  I do, too.  It's also why I kind of huff a little when folks call *Rome* the greatest historical tv show of the period they've ever seen. :D

There isn't much that's on the same level, but Dennis Potter's ***Pennies From Heaven*** and ***The Singing Detective*** (not on streaming, afaik) to me are god-level tv; they can both tear your guts out. Both also got remade as movies. Avoid the *Pennies From Heaven* movie (unless you're a Steve Martin fan or need to see Christopher Walken dancing; but it's Hollywood supremely not-getting the source material); the *Singing Detective* movie remake is better since Potter did most of the screenplay himself before he died, but it's still softer than the original tv series, even with Robert Downey Jr. in the lead. I also liked Potter's later work, like *Lipstick on Your Collar* (*very* young Ewan McGregor), *Blackeyes* (very young Gina Bellman)*,* and *Karaoke/Cold Lazarus* \[where Albert Finney stars, and Ian McDiarmid gets to play someone other than Palpatine :-\]*,* but most think they're weaker series.

Also god-level tv is Alan Bennett's ***Talking Heads*** (also not on streaming, but probably youtube-able), can also slay you with nothing but monologues and insanely great actors (including Bennett himself). I'm pissed off as hell at [PBS for promising us](https://tellyspotting.kera.org/2020/10/19/talking-heads-revamp-celebrates-masterpieces-50th-on-pbs-in-2021/) only two of [the 2020 BBC remakes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ww6Oex3MI90), rather than the full dozen (and not the two that are the new ones!), and then not even delivering those. (If you want a taste of the remakes, [here's some clips](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p08ftkkx/clips)).

A show that shares two stars with *I, Claudius* (Sian Phillips and Patricia Quinn; Livia and Livilla) and that had *Doctor Who* folk behind the camera (Verity Lambert and Waris Husein) is the Pankhurst/suffragette biodrama, ***Shoulder to Shoulder*** (can't find it on streaming)***.*** Phillips plays mother Emmaline Pankhurst, while Quinn plays daughter Christabel; Angela Down plays Sylvia Pankhurst. Possibly the first time a UK tv show had a primarily female cast.

Phillips also was in an adaptation of ***How Green Was My Valley*** **(1975)** \[again not on streaming I can find\] that was kickass, since the entire cast was actually Welsh. Phillips primarily spoke Welsh up until the age of 18 when she went to London to pursue acting. Her Beth is monumental. BTW, other trivia: she was married to Peter O'Toole around the time she was in *I, Claudius,* and to SF fans, she'll forever be known as the Reverend Mother in Lynch's *Dune.* :) She's still around and acting, btw. I last saw her in *C.B. Strike* on HBO Max and she's apparently been cast in Season 2 of *Good Omens*).

And then there's ***Tenko*** (Britbox in the UK, but not in the US)*,* an ITV drama about British women in a Pacific theatre POW camp during WWII that always killed me.

Mid-80s (so not quite the mid-70s of *I, Claudius)* there's ***Brideshead Revisited*** (Freevee, Tubi, etc.)*,* based on the Evelyn Waugh novel. It stars a very young Jeremy Irons and Anthony Andrews, and the background cast includes Laurence freakin' Olivier. (If you can find Olivier's 1983 *King Lear* from around this time period, it's pretty great, too. [The cast is to die for](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0087561/reference/). John Hurt plays the Fool, Diana Rigg is Regan, Leo McKern is Gloucester, Robert Lindsay is Edmund to David Threfall's Edgar, it's a parade of stars).

And I always always was a sucker for *any* John Hawkesworth historical drama (mostly via *Masterpiece Theatre),* so ***Upstairs Downstairs*** (Britbox; the show that *Downton Abbey* wants to be, but kind of misses by a mile), ***The Duchess of Duke Street*** (Amazon Prime)*,* ***The Flame Trees of Thika*** (Acorn)*,* ***Danger UXB*** (AcornTV)*,* and ***Sherlock Holmes*** (Britbox) all come under that heading.  Hawkesworth's *Sherlock Holmes* (where Jeremy Brett plays Holmes and either David Burke or Edward Hardwicke is Watson) are of particularly interest if you like *Sherlock,* since it's incredibly sublimely obvious that both Moffat and Gatiss were rabid fans of that show (and the books) and that the show freed them from ever having to do a ""faithful"" adaptation of the stories and let them go their own way.

One other little dramedy that I *adored* from this time period is ***Flickers*** which [you can find on Freevee](https://www.amazon.com/Part-1/dp/B07CVJVFM4). Possibly the first thing I ever saw Bob Hoskins in. It's written by Roy Clarke, and it's about a Cockney entrepreneur who wants to get a film studio off the ground in the days of silent film. It also stars Frances de la Tour.

BTW, if you want to see what the actor who played Claudius looks like now that he's *actually* in his 80s, Derek Jacobi is one of the stars in Sally Wainwright's dramedy [*Last Tango in Halifax*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IN4gS00ZnT8) (Netflix). Very atypical role for him to play a Northern gaffer :), as he typically gets ""posh"" roles. Like his appearance on *Doctor Who* (s3e11, ""Utopia"") or *The Crown* (s3e8 *""Dangling Man"").*

In the US, after the success of shows like *I, Claudius,* there were also historical drama miniseries aplenty like ***Roots*** (HBO Max) and ***Shogun*** (not on streaming, but starred Richard Chamberlain and Toshiro Mifune, and is about to be remade by FX on Hulu) that might also be worth looking for.

Schlag den Star,"So, I guess their goal today was to take everyone who said D+ had no original content besides The Mandalorian, and pretty much punch them in the face repeatedly."
Schlag den Star,Hooch is crazy
Schlag den Star,/u/arashtp you missed Percy Jackson.
Schlag den Star,"Nothing on any of the ""old"" Netflix series has me sad...  Nice write up, though."
Schlag den Star,I thought this was wallstreebets DD for a second lol
Schlag den Star,Super stoked on most of this. I’m especially looking forward to the Nat geo content. Can you imagine if Disney+ dropped with half of these titles? Game changer
Schlag den Star,"So strange to realize Ice Age is owned by Disney now. 

Also I’m sort of unexpectedly excited about the continuation of Mighty Ducks!"
Schlag den Star,"Based on the release timelines of those shows, it looks like their strategy is: 

Zeitgeist show for 6 weeks -> 1 week of cool down —> couple weeks of hype up -> next Zeitgeist show -> Repeat"
Schlag den Star,They're really going all out with the High Republic.
Schlag den Star,did She Hulk get a trailer or anything?
Schlag den Star,that's a lot of content
Schlag den Star,A Turner and Hooch reboot yyyeeeeessss!!! I've been a fan (we call ourselves Hoochers) for years and am flipping out right now!!!!
Schlag den Star,Missing rogue squadron on Star Wars
Schlag den Star,Hocus Pocus 2. What.
Schlag den Star,"A lot of this is awesome, but can I just take a moment to appreciate *Sister Act 3*?"
Schlag den Star,">Tiana is the first princess to have her own Walt Disney Animation Studios series

Just going to ignore the Little Mermaid and Tangled series apparently."
Schlag den Star,[deleted]
Schlag den Star,I have only read a hand full of moon knight comics but from what I have heard and read making a PG moon knight show is not going to go over well with fans.
Schlag den Star,Any specific dates to go with this?
Schlag den Star,You forgot the multiple tongue in cheek references to Matt Murdock.  Charlie Cox's Daredevil is officially part of the MCU now.  Hes apparently in She Hulk and Spider-Man 3.
Schlag den Star,"Damn, the Ducks end up becoming what they rebelled against..."
Schlag den Star,"As a bi dude I'm still waiting for literally anything big that features a non-straight dude. In film they ignored it almost completely out of fear of gay-hating countries banning it and them losing money (like China). 

Really hoping for something to come through, maybe with x-men back in the fold Iceman could get something"
Schlag den Star,So is Ahsoka taking the place of the Rebels spinoff? Because thats what I was most excited for
Schlag den Star,Disney is milking Star Wars and Marvel for everything dollar they can squeeze. There are way too many reboots and remakes. They need originally sourced content that has no reliance on existing IP. How about some original NON-Marvel/Star Wars scripted content? I think the Mandalorian is a cute show but I want to see ORIGINAL content for once. This slate of shows are not enough to keep all of their subscribers satisfied.
Schlag den Star,Seems like Star Wars's future is on TV.
Schlag den Star,Is it weird that I'm most excited for the Josh Peck version of Turner and Hooch?
Schlag den Star,"Looks like they're updating Microcosmos with A Real Bug's Life, that should be cool as fuck."
Schlag den Star,">The Mighty Ducks: Game Changers

>Lauren Graham (Gilmore Girls, Parenthood) and Emilio Estevez (reprising his role from the original feature films) star in the next chapter of the hit Mighty Ducks franchise, premiering in early 2021. In present day Minnesota, the Mighty Ducks have evolved from scrappy underdogs to an ultra-competitive, powerhouse youth hockey team. After 12-year-old Evan is unceremoniously cut from the Ducks, he and his mom Alex set out to build their own ragtag team of misfits to challenge the cutthroat, win-at-all-costs culture of competitive youth sports.

I hope Disney has been paying attn to Cobra Kai and takes all the good from it and applies it to the Ducks!!!"
Schlag den Star,"Man, Tony Stark cannot keep control of his tech, can he? Well, I guess he's dead, so that makes sense."
Schlag den Star,The one thing I want from Marvel is an OG Nick Fury and the Howling Commandos show.
Schlag den Star,They forgot Shadow Hunters.
Schlag den Star,I just want to have the spin off Thrawn and Ezra travels in space show.
Schlag den Star,so much content that post alone made me vomit .
Schlag den Star,"Hey, bozo, why didn't you mention It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia?

Great list, otherwise."
Schlag den Star,Thanks man you're awesome
Schlag den Star,[Rogue squadron](https://youtu.be/5bLkTjn6Y_s)
Schlag den Star,Disney+ launch was more like beta test to ensure their decision of allocating such resources to the platform
Schlag den Star,"The criticism was regarding lack of original screenplays, too. It's still true in that aspect."
Schlag den Star,"It's still lacks diversity, it's still marvel, star wars and Pixar animated pg-13 movies, still no new new IPs."
Schlag den Star,[deleted]
Schlag den Star,"If they don't have Phill Lewis playing the dog using mocap, they dun goofed."
Schlag den Star,*holds up lighter*
Schlag den Star,And Swiss Family Robinson.
Schlag den Star,"Just hints at Daredevil, from Sony in Spider-Man 3 and at the reveal here today for She-Hulk."
Schlag den Star,"Yeah sounds like the Multiverse in SM3 will pull in Daredevil and Kingpin. Which could be great.

Daredevil was hinted at strongly for SheHulk, and there have been rumors that DNofrio has campaigned hard and they’ve taken him seriously as maybe using his character to put together the Sinister Six."
Schlag den Star,"There's a big hint in Hawkeye. Maya Lopez is a definitively Daredevil character (Echo, a deaf woman who can see something once and imitate it originally hired by Kingpin to take out Daredevil and eventually befriending him). She also wore the Ronin outfit for awhile that Hawkeye wore in Endgame after his family vanished (New Avengers comics).

Edit: why am I being downvoted for this?"
Schlag den Star,Not enough 🚀🚀🚀
Schlag den Star,It’s pretty genius
Schlag den Star,Super into the Acolyte as I’d really like to see what the Sith/dark side users were up to during this time period
Schlag den Star,"No, but they confirmed Tatiana Maslany."
Schlag den Star,Tim Roth will be back as Abomination and Mark Ruffalo.
Schlag den Star,Its a rather deceptive line if your not in the know.  WDAS is the movie studio. Disney Television Animation is the studio that typically handles the TV side (they were the ones that made the Tangled series).
Schlag den Star,That's not necessarily a bad thing tbh. It's how they execute it that matters. GOTG was kinda considered a bottom of the barrel IP for marvel before they made it and it turned out well.
Schlag den Star,"There’s like 70 announced shows here and less than 10 are actual original ideas. Really disappointing *in my opinion*.

I get people like Star Wars and stuff, but it seems extreme to me."
Schlag den Star,"I think it could be done. For me at least the fun part is the mind-bendy unreliable narrator stuff and not the graphic violence. Although there is something to be said for when other characters meet Moon Knight and are like, ""oh this guy is *crazy* crazy and not just *Batman* crazy."""
Schlag den Star,"This didn’t mention any of the Marvel movies since it’s still not certain whether they’ll be released in theaters first or on Disney+ at the same time, but The Eternals is set to have their first openly gay main character whenever that’s released.

If you haven’t watched the Disney+ short film Out, you absolutely should."
Schlag den Star,"Young Avengers is just over the horizon, and that comes with the most prominent gay couple in marvel. Still a few years out though."
Schlag den Star,Not sure if it is 100% confirmed but I remember seeing somewhere that Valkyrie is looking for a wife in the next Thor movie.
Schlag den Star,"As a fellow homo, I'm sorry you're getting downvoted, but that's r/television for you. I've learned not to bring up representation issues on this sub anymore."
Schlag den Star,"I would bet it will be in a team, or they will reveal the character is gay in a sequel...that way people in China will already be invested.  Because you’re right....they want that China money badly. 


Wouldn’t it be a kick in the nuts to China if the wait until like Shang Chi 3 and reveal he was gay the whole time! Lmao. That could literally start a war!!"
Schlag den Star,I really don't like the sound of this. The whole point of the Ducks is that they are scrappy underdogs. Having them become what they played against feels kind of weird. And it's obviously gonna end with both Ducks teams playing against each other. It just sounds weird to me.
Schlag den Star,"I feel like this'll be a big part of the Ashoka show, considering that she was still searching when we see her in The Mandolorian."
Schlag den Star,That’s pathetic
Schlag den Star,Thats not on Disney+ you 1 star fool.
Schlag den Star,"They're going all in because they've lost all profits from Disney parks and tourism, 75% of their revenue.

Also why they gutted ESPN"
Schlag den Star,"Certainly, but was anyone really expecting that? Aside from Pixar, Disney hasn't done an original story in... I'm not sure. Possibly ever."
Schlag den Star,Pixar films are all new IPs lol
Schlag den Star,[deleted]
Schlag den Star,One Star Wars IP will drive more total interest than anything on HBO Max lmao
Schlag den Star,"Uh ""Win or Lose"" is a new IP."
Schlag den Star,"You are soo right. Marvel has been overdone, it's a stale medium at this point.  SW feels the same after the last 3 movies. Even Mando is aimless with no real main plotline.

It's so formulaic it isn't appealing.

Will smith movie,
Cars tv show, 
SW, SW, SW, SW, SW
Marvel movies or shows of all side movie characters, because why not saturate the market with bland superheros"
Schlag den Star,"Yeah. Did anyone really expect Disney to do something genuinely new? Aside from Pixar, which still has very niche content, I can't remember the last time Disney did an actually new story. 

It's one of the reasons this obsession people on here have with D+ ""killing"" Netflix is so silly."
Schlag den Star,Well original content in this context means content that is developed specificity for the platform and is owned by Disney
Schlag den Star,"
>Daredevil was hinted at strongly for SheHulk...

That doesn't excite me...  I don't see Daredevil remaining dark and gritty if placed in She-Hulk.  SH over the years has been more of a fun loving character."
Schlag den Star,"It's going to be interesting to see how Tim Roth plays his take on Mark Ruffalo. 

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

^^i ^^jest"
Schlag den Star,[deleted]
Schlag den Star,"It's a Disney property.

They a announced it today, as well.

It actually appears on traditional broadcast television, anyone who can't see this **IS A SAVAGE AND AN IDIOT**.

Stoked about almost all of these, though."
Schlag den Star,Most of these projects are planned before the COVID
Schlag den Star,Different services provide different content. I dont see why that's only an issue when it's Disney. How much Oscar winning animated content do we see on HBO or Netflix?
Schlag den Star,Duh.  If you want Disney's adult content you mosey over to Hulu.  If you've been looking at the end of the year critics' lists you'll have noticed Disney is beating Netflix and Warnerbrothers decisively when it comes to critical acclaim.
Schlag den Star,Disney doesn’t give a fuck about that. They care about commercial success of which they aren’t matched.
Schlag den Star,The show is listed as a comedy. Not sure how Charlie's Matt Murdock would fit into that.
Schlag den Star,"I get it. But AntMan seemed really dumb to me. So did Thor at the time, and GotG is when I thought they had given up. 

I think the Series will be used to set up bigger events in the movies.  Almost like a Rogue One to Star Wars.  

That way people who want more background will have it, and yet you don’t HAVE to have seen it to follow the movies.  

Also Ironheart, Kate Bishop, Ms Marvel and I’m betting a Young Loki will get set up for a Secret Avengers movie."
Schlag den Star,"Armor Wars is widely considered one of the best, if not the best period, Iron Man stories.

We’ll most likely see Justin Hammer return and the intro of some other big Iron Man villains like Crimson Dynamo.

I wouldn’t call it bottom of the barrel. The only difference is that War Machine will he finally getting the spotlight rather than Iron Man"
Schlag den Star,"Well, you have to remember, when they first started making Marvel movies, Iron Man was a very odd choice in how to begin."
Schlag den Star,Yes.  Can they only make outer space/superhero stuff?  That’s not the only genre.
Schlag den Star,I'd definitely watch a season of 'Untitled Mob Series with Nicholas Pileggi'
Schlag den Star,Sucks he left The Batman spinoff project
Schlag den Star,"Well, that's an impressive set of shows. If they pull together half decent they all might be worth a checkout on premise alone."
Schlag den Star,Gonna wait on completed series reviews this time after he got bored of Boardwalk and rushed the ending.
Ackley Bridge,[deleted]
Ackley Bridge,Uhmmm.... I literally went to a high school...
Ackley Bridge,"is this the new skins?
"
Ackley Bridge,or the new Waterloo Road
Ackley Bridge,Buffy the vampire slayer
Ackley Bridge,"My mad fat diary should be WAY higher on the list, and while Sounds can be great, it is only the first generation that actually is.

There are also some good ones you missed, My So Called Life, I am Not Okay With This, Sex Education, or as odd as it sounds on the surface... Buffy the Vampire Slayer"
Ackley Bridge,Watching Sex Education on Netflix again during quarantine.. give it a watch
Ackley Bridge,"No Wonder Years, Party of Five, Dawson's Creek, or Degrassi?"
Ackley Bridge,My So Called Life.
Ackley Bridge,are oc and one tree hill not qualified?
Ackley Bridge,"Probably not the same tone or era, but Anne with an e is pretty good."
Ackley Bridge,Thanks for the list but your taste is wayyyyyy off from the type of teen dramas I like
Ackley Bridge,Me & my fam likes [Atypical](https://www.netflix.com/search?q=ATYPICAL&jbv=80117540&jbp=0&jbr=0) which is a comedy with angsty moments.
Ackley Bridge,Sex Education
Ackley Bridge,"Not in order 

1. Euphoria 
2. Elite
3. Skins 
4. Sex Education 
5. Gossip Girl
6. Love 101 
7. On my Block
8. American Vandal
9. The society 
10. 13 Reasons why
11. Looking for Alaska 
12. One Tree Hill
13. The end of the fucking world
14. Trinkets 
15. The chilling adventures of Sabrina"
Ackley Bridge,"I can't believe you've done this.

How horrible do you have to be to post a list like this on /television?

^(I might finally watch Skins. Not my typical kind of show. Haven't considered watching it since I worked at Blockbuster.)"
Ackley Bridge,why everyone ignore sex education
Ackley Bridge,Yes. 100%. Absolutely. Best tv series of all time. A must-watch for everyone who loves supernatural romance teen dramas.
Ackley Bridge,"> while Sounds can be great, it is only the first generation that actually is.

I assume you mean Skins?? Loud and wrong. 2nd Gen > 1s Gen, at least for me. I've seen a few persons who've prefered the 3rd. The whole thing is great. Each gen is like a different TV show. They're similar of course but at the same time unique in their own different ways. 

> My So Called Life, I am Not Okay With This, Sex Education

I considered them all. If the list was Top 20 they'd definately be there, along with Veronica Mars.

Never seen Buffy but I kinda get the impression it's a supernatural series with teen drama elements as opposed to being a teen-drama at heart."
Ackley Bridge,exactly!!! I just finished rewatching and it's definitely I'm the same league as skins and skam. three of these are quite possibly the best in their genre. like ever. I'm so passionate about this trust me
Ackley Bridge,yea ive seen it.
Ackley Bridge,"Degrassi was the shit


I watched pretty much the whole thing on youtube a few months qgo, from junior high to season 10 of next generation. A lot of it was bad, but i enjoyed the majority of it"
Ackley Bridge,"You're mistaken if you believe I've seen every teen drama ever made lol. 

I've only seen My So-called Life from those you listed."
Ackley Bridge,never seen em.
Ackley Bridge,nope.
Ackley Bridge,"Skins is really good actually, give it a go."
Ackley Bridge,"> How horrible do you have to be to post a list like this on /television?

why, what did i do? 😶😕"
Ackley Bridge,Oh no Buffy is absolutely a teen drama. All of the supernatural and horror elements work to service the teen drama stories in some way or another. I implore you to watch it OP.
Ackley Bridge,lol elite makes the list but not sex education. Elite season 1 was good but damn it got chessy so fast.
Ackley Bridge,Just stop after the first generation
Ackley Bridge,Just trying to help you avoid crucifixion with some sarcasm. :)
Ackley Bridge,"Naw, Buffy is definitely a supernatural series first and foremost."
Ackley Bridge,can't. too long. don't have the time.
Ackley Bridge,Elite season 2 is far better than season 1. Sex Education is also very cheesy. Élite is a soap.
Ackley Bridge,The second gen is good too. The third is not
Ackley Bridge,We can agree to disagree on that one.
Ackley Bridge,"Generation 1 is brisket from Terry Black's in Austin, TX... 2 is dumpster diving at Arby's on Sunday night... Generation 3 is a raw sewage leak"
Ackley Bridge,"Ha, this is reddit, sir.  We need to disagree viciously!

Anyways,  I'd say only the first three seasons have a concentration on coming of age stories and even then many of the stories don't really map well to that experience (for example, most of Angel's season 2 arc)"
Ackley Bridge,"Bahahahahahahaha 😂😂

I guess I do see where you’re coming from - but the arc where Angel/Buffy sleep together and all of a sudden he’s uninterested and also literally evil....sounds like every boy I dated in high school."
Ackley Bridge,"That's sounds rough. Sorry!

I think the seed of the idea is applicable but the actual specifics don't track well.  I.E.  needing to kill you're murderous boyfriend or having your gypsy friend research cures."
Ackley Bridge,"lmao no it’s ok it’s quirky.

Okay yeah no I get that!! I should add that I haven’t rewatched it in full for a little while so I’m arguing based off memory and my brain thing is more like a bowl of spaghetti hoops at this point than a functioning organ but I guess the show was more fluid than I remember!!"
Ackley Bridge,"Just watched 3, decompressing now. That was brutal, but well worth it. 

Supposedly it's based on actual people and their experiences, woven into a fictional story. 

I'd be interested to see how this would play to an American audience. Showing ISIS without them all having fangs and tails might not go down well. "
Ackley Bridge,It scheduled to air on [National Geographic channel starting September 18.](http://channel.nationalgeographic.com/the-state/) National Geographic co-produced.
Ackley Bridge,"> I'd be interested to see how this would play to an American audience.

Me too tbh, but I don't think it'll go down well. I mean, this thread I made is the only one in this subreddit that ever mentions Ackley Bidge or The State ~~and its already been downvoted to 0. lol~~

Edit: aww thanks guys!"
Teenage Bounty Hunters,Still want a conclusion to Sterling and April 🥹
Teenage Bounty Hunters,Deserved a far better fate. Legitimately funny and well made show.
Teenage Bounty Hunters,I was so disappointed when this was cancelled.  Show was pretty funny.
Teenage Bounty Hunters,"Loved that show. 

I’m Not Okay With This also got hosed."
Teenage Bounty Hunters,"Really good show,  Funny, smart, no slow parts, great actors.  The way the sisters communicated gave a extra uniqueness to it.  I was really hoping it wouldn’t get the Netflix cut.  I really don’t like that they do that.  NETFLIX bring this show back."
Teenage Bounty Hunters,"Only show that I watched two times in a row. It stings but I'm sure it would have gotten a second season if COVID hadn't hit. It's a cheap show to make with mostly unknown actors but those safety measures would probably double the budget.

Sadly it ends in a cliffhanger, but up to that it is such a fun show, which I would still highly recommend."
Teenage Bounty Hunters,"the show was so good, the cast, the dialogue, the cinematography. it was better than it had any right to be."
Teenage Bounty Hunters,I figured this one was the combination of young actors and covid.  I really enjoyed the southern private school/country club setting and the commentary on purity culture was so true to that environment.
Teenage Bounty Hunters,I still get mad about this like 2x a month since it happened. So sad
Teenage Bounty Hunters,If it had been named something different we might have been watching season 2 now.
Teenage Bounty Hunters,"I really enjoyed this show! I binged it in a weekend, it was delightful. But I think the name kinda kept people away, it sounds so silly"
Teenage Bounty Hunters,It was actually unique and good. Just another Netflix jumping the gun and shooting themselves.
Teenage Bounty Hunters,"I didn't know this show existed... Trailer looks promising.

And it came out the summer of COVID? Did Netflix not promote it?

Shame."
Teenage Bounty Hunters,It was such a great show and I was shocked they didn’t renew it.
Teenage Bounty Hunters,"That show was way more enjoyable than you’d expect. 

It was probably the first Netflix show that didn’t get renewed that actually bothered me."
Teenage Bounty Hunters,At least their stock value paid the price for their ineptitude.
Teenage Bounty Hunters,I know Netflix already doesn’t have a great reputation with cancelling shows but they are especially awful when it comes to queer shows.
Teenage Bounty Hunters,I think Tiger King overshadowed everything in that time period.
Teenage Bounty Hunters,Damn I didn't even know it existed I'll have to check it out.
Teenage Bounty Hunters,This show is something that wouldn’t normally interest me.  I have 3 teenagers myself and don’t normally watch shows with teenage leads.  But it was recommended to me by a friend so I gave it a try.   I thought it was funny as hell.   The two sisters did a great job of being funny without being obnoxious to an old fart like myself.
Teenage Bounty Hunters,One of my fave shows....ugh
Teenage Bounty Hunters,I’m months late to this but hell yeah it does. I need more conculsions 😭
Teenage Bounty Hunters,Oh come on. That show had ridiculous trash written all over it.
Teenage Bounty Hunters,Maybe it should have been good then.
Teenage Bounty Hunters,ilysm
Teenage Bounty Hunters,BS. It was a ripoff of the superior but criminally ignored Sweet/Vicious from MTV. Go watch that instead if you haven't seen it yet.
Teenage Bounty Hunters,"I don't know why it was cancelled it can't possibly of cost that much money to make.

It special effects were essentially a few firecrackers and a macro lens on the cameras for when they were doing a psychic communication thing. And yogurt."
Teenage Bounty Hunters,"I'm Not Okay With This was so good..They captured the vibes of life in a dead end small town perfectly. Great work by the music supervisor as well, so many cool [tracks.](https://youtu.be/C0LvwuBI_WE) Just one of many shows renewed then cancelled because of COVID."
Teenage Bounty Hunters,Can't agree more.
Teenage Bounty Hunters,"Netflix is cancelling shows that aren't successful like every company ever did, this was one of them.

A show being good has little to do with popularity and popularity is what makes a show get renewed. Well some good but not popular shows can get renewed for awards reasons and such but this is not a show that good."
Teenage Bounty Hunters,Well they could make it now. I don't understand the logic that taking a break means you can't just bring it back from where it left off.
Teenage Bounty Hunters,"I thought it was some sort of reality show until I saw comments on Reddit mentioning it was a comedy, after news of the cancellation.  

Really enjoyed it and am still disappointed in the cancellation even though I knew it had already been cancelled when I started it."
Teenage Bounty Hunters,This is exactly what I tell people about that show. Don’t let the stupid name ruin it because shits literally hilarious
Teenage Bounty Hunters,">Did Netflix not promote it?

Yes. I heard about it here. It matches a bunch of different flags that would usually tell Netflix I'm interested. No top line trailer from Netflix, no real press, and the first weekend, it wasn't even in the first section of ""new releases"" for me. And again, based on household viewing habits, Netflix's viewing algorithm should have been throwing this at me, like it does with a bunch of other shows with similar tags."
Teenage Bounty Hunters,"The show got some buzz on this subreddit when it released, but yeah I never saw any other promotion. Netflix often doesn't really promote things.

Give it a watch, it was quite good. The season wraps up the ongoing plot line, but sets up a new one from what I remember, sort of like Santa Clarita Diet, which also was an unfortunate cancelation."
Teenage Bounty Hunters,did you watch it?
Teenage Bounty Hunters,Covid noped out their whole production schedule
Teenage Bounty Hunters,It’s even one of the most liked shows but still. No more.
Teenage Bounty Hunters,"Massive agree from me, probably the show I was most annoyed about getting cancelled, I really needed more."
Teenage Bounty Hunters,"The problem with that is it can sometimes take a few seasons for a show to be successful.

But ever since stranger things was a day one success Netflix basically expects every show to be as successful as stranger things or else it gets canned.

But that's just not feasible in the long run, we're starting to see the effects of it with Netflix users at a low.

If the office was an Netflix original it would have got canned after the first series despite the office taking a few seasons to get it's groove."
Teenage Bounty Hunters,"But Netflix has historically been a boost to shows that were less popular on cable , such as Breaking Bad. They should be acutely aware that viewership is attracted to quality over time."
Teenage Bounty Hunters,">like every company did

That's objectively not true. Season 1 of Game of Thrones did terribly in the ratings, a dipshit company like Netflix would have cut it on the cliff hanger of Sean Bean being killed and cancelled the show.  Meanwhile HBO is out there giving a shit about their reputation as a creator rather than the immediate bottom line and kept shows like GoT and The Leftovers because it meant something to be known as the creator of prestige television, and it rewarded them with a billion dollar franchise that has multiple spin-offs airing soon and others in development.  Succession wasn't having great numbers, they renewed it and it gets HBO mentioned in every article on the internet about the best shows on TV today.  That's pretty fucking good advertising for the company. 

No one watched season 1 of Breaking Bad but renewing it put AMC on the map as a key player in the golden age of television and set them up for success with Walking Dead. FX went from a poor man's TNT that appeared to be Fox's dumping ground for shows they didn't want to associate with the Fox brand, but sticking with shows like Nip/Tuck, Fargo and Legion has established them as another surprise producer of prestige television.

Only shitty companies follow ratings blindly.  Choosing only the lowest quality product to sell makes you the lowest quality service.  It's what makes Dollar Stores so fucking repulsive and the reason people stopped buying Chinese made products, they have no standards for the product they sell because they can still make a profit on garbage, so they're synonymous with garbage and repel any potential shoppers who have self-respect.

Crude TL;DR:  Companies can make money by turning newspaper into single-ply toilet paper but their company name will still be associated with a raw asshole.  Netflix is doing their absolute best to be the ""My asshole is so raw it's bleeding and I'm still not done wiping"" of streaming.  Their competition is out there developing two ply with quilted pockets and shit while they're thinking to themselves ""Our toilet paper was the most popular when it was the only toilet paper on the market so we can just increase prices forever and never have to improve again"" while they fire the entire R&D department over and over for creating the only products the company makes that people actually talk about.

Fucking idiot."
Teenage Bounty Hunters,Once a show is canceled it's incredible difficult to bring everyone back. Crew and cast are booking other shows to earn a living and their schedules are not gonna align to continue this.
Teenage Bounty Hunters,"Tragically the likely answer, especially for a show about *teenagers* a year or two of delays can be enough of a hassle they'll just get the axe instead."
Teenage Bounty Hunters,"It creates quite a negative feedback loop.

People are more reluctant to start on a new Netflix show,  worried netflix might cancel it without warning.

This leads to worse metrics for the initial season and Netflix shitcans it.

Now with even more shows axed, people are even more hesitant to give it a go

Repeat until everything is precancelled"
Teenage Bounty Hunters,Stranger Things wasn't a day one success. It was out for a few months before it got real popular.
Teenage Bounty Hunters,[deleted]
Teenage Bounty Hunters,"Game of Thrones or Breaking Bad didn't do terrible at all, they weren't as big as the later seasons of course but they made decent to good scores for unknown shows. 

Also you all are acting like they cancelled some great show and such. This thing was nowhere near the level of...I don't know... oh just two of the greatest shows ever on TV (shows that even without audience would actually get awards, it's hilarious to think Teenage Bounty Hunters could even get one). And it wasn't watched at all (Netflix has the numbers we don't).

It's weird how they didn't cancel Stranger Things, Squid Game, The Crown, Umbrella Academy or many other shows that actually met their public. Nobody talked about this show and nobody watched it. That's why it cancelled, which companies have always done yes (some shows have even been cancelled before airing one episode or after a few only, not even being able to finish their season). In the end, they are a business and why would they continue to spend money in shows that don't have appeal? They're already losing money like everyone else in streaming. Nobody is subscribing to Netflix for a show like Teenage Bounty Hunters (again, THAT's the show we are arguing about there, even on just the title this was a doomed project)

And let's be honest the other services are not doing better, HBO Max just cancelled like half their slate (even cancelling two original movies before they even make it to air lol) and Disney is only making mini series (so no renewal either) but the narrative seem to be more and more that their shows are shitty, to only talk about the other two big ones."
Teenage Bounty Hunters,"Not to mention the younger the cast, the more difference a year or two makes, suddenly they ain't *teenagers* anymore."
Teenage Bounty Hunters,"From Wikipedia 

""According to Symphony, within the first 35 days of release, Stranger Things averaged ratings of around 14.07 million adults between the ages of 18–49 in the United States""

That's as close to a day one success as they can be"
Teenage Bounty Hunters,I remember the show blowing up pretty quick but maybe that was just my experience.
Teenage Bounty Hunters,"I’m aware that Netflix didn’t produce Breaking Bad. I used it as an example because it’s a show that didn’t have immediate success but then became huge, largely on their platform. 

I will never watch this show. Not because it’s not any good, but because Netflix canceled it.

Netflix should understand that original shows take time to find their bases and not cancel them so early that they remove any incentive to ever watch them in the first place."
Teenage Bounty Hunters,">Not the same as they were not making Breaking Bad, so they weren't the ones losing money, they can't afford to pay to make shows nobody watches.

I would argue they can't afford NOT to make shows nobody watches.

Every fucking Netflix Original gets canned, usually after a cliffhanger season finale. So, there's no point in me watching ANY netflix shows if I know that, in the end, I'm just going to get blueballed over it.

So why even sub to netflix?

Right, I don't anymore... and a lot of other people have been cancelling subscriptions too.

I'd argue they would have kept some subscribers if their subscribers could actually finish a show they were watching."
Teenage Bounty Hunters,They weren't teenagers before either
Teenage Bounty Hunters,"Netflix would of canceled it after the first season for sure, specially if it was during Covid"
Teenage Bounty Hunters,"I agree. I think this is more why I am not happy  about this show and so many of Netflix’s shows that get cancelled after one season.  Makes sense not enough popularity is why a lot of shows get cancelled but they seem to cancel the shows within days of releasing. 

Netflix give them time to see if they grow popularity.  My new go to is to see if a show is cancelled before I watch it too."
Teenage Bounty Hunters,[deleted]
Teenage Bounty Hunters,Do you feel the same with every other service?  Because its not like HBO or Peacock or Amazon are renewing everything either
Teenage Bounty Hunters,"My point is simply that the younger a cast, the more noticeable any production delays are from how distinctly different some folks look as they age."
Teenage Bounty Hunters,That mindset is why shows like this get cancelled
Teenage Bounty Hunters,"No, the problem is that Netflix spends way too much money shitting out 100 new shows with little promotion and nearly no opportunities for them to gain momentum before giving them the ax. 

Network TV can be shit but they do try to at least promote their shows and give them a chance to build an audience. It's how Community and Arrested Development (eg) received multiple seasons despite anemic ratings. 

If Netflix launches 50 new shows and 45 of them get cancelled or pocket vetoed, why would I bother investing in any of them knowing the odds were against me? Or more succinctly: why would I put more faith in Netflix's original programming than their executives seem to?"
Teenage Bounty Hunters,"Statistically speaking, Netflix’s cancelation rate is the same as other networks/streaming services except maybe Apple."
Teenage Bounty Hunters,That really sucks.  I enjoyed it a lot.  It suffered from a terrible name but it had a lot of heart and the chemistry between the leads was really good.
Teenage Bounty Hunters,[removed]
Teenage Bounty Hunters,This show was surprisingly good. I’m actually a bit upset about this. I really liked the girls and Bowser’s relationship.
Teenage Bounty Hunters,"I have never even heard of this show until today, it's never shown up on my netflix front page and I have watched YA stuff before. Netflix really need to improve their algorithm."
Teenage Bounty Hunters,What a shame. I really enjoyed the show. I'll be keeping an eye on what the two main actresses do next.
Teenage Bounty Hunters,"Yo wtf? I thought everyone loved this show?

EDIT: And they just canceled GLOW too tf is happening."
Teenage Bounty Hunters,"I don't even know why I bother watching netflix shows. You put such an investment in with the characters and *poof*, they're gone. 

This one was so good!"
Teenage Bounty Hunters,Super disappointing. Add this one to my favorite shows that Netflix cancelled after a cliffhanger with Santa Clarita diet
Teenage Bounty Hunters,[deleted]
Teenage Bounty Hunters,"It's becoming harder and harder to be loyal to netflix when they can't finish any damn series you become attached to. What's the point of them even making these if they wont at least finish them off.

If they keep doing this I'm just going to switch to piracy for all things Netflix."
Teenage Bounty Hunters,Fuck asshole. That show was pretty great and that ending. WTF
Teenage Bounty Hunters,"Oh good, another Netflix original that dumps out in a cliffhanger. Why the fuck do I watch anything new on that platform? Great show, very funny, good cast chemistry.

I’m done trying out new shit on Netflix. Make it three seasons with a conclusion or I’m passing"
Teenage Bounty Hunters,"Disappointing, this show was a very nice surprise. 

Guessing you need to be making Stranger Things money to film in the US in the near future, that’s at least the third first season show canceled that filmed in the states.

Edit - minutes after this, GLOW was unrenewed and canceled. Yeah domestic shows are in trouble."
Teenage Bounty Hunters,"Netflix didn't have a stellar year, and this thing was one of their best products. Doesn't even look high budget even.

This year Netflix sent a very strong message, quality is not what they are after. Anyways, cancelling a show after just 2 months of it's premier is just ruthless. And for those that might say ""it wasn't watched by many"", that's just not true, unless Netflix is willingly releasing wrong information [***as can be seen here***](https://deadline.com/2020/09/lucifer-netflix-tops-nielsen-streaming-rankings-1234578799/)."
Teenage Bounty Hunters,WTF that was like their best new live action show this year.
Teenage Bounty Hunters,"This fucking sucks , along with cancelling GLOW this is probably the worst decision they have made this year."
Teenage Bounty Hunters,"What a dreadful few hours for me.

My most anticipated movie of all time(Dune) gets delayed a year.

My favorite TV show of the year gets canceled.

Endless, bottomless pain."
Teenage Bounty Hunters,This show was really great!  What the fuck!?!?
Teenage Bounty Hunters,This is a huge disappointment. I finished the show a few weeks ago and was already looking forward to the next season. I guess all Netflix is good for at this point is giving us 10+ year old movies that weren’t popular when they actually released
Teenage Bounty Hunters,Fuck sakeeeee. I basically inhaled this show. Was buzzing for another season.
Teenage Bounty Hunters,"Oh i'm sad!! I love this tv show. 

Netflix don't u dare to cancel umbrella academy!!!"
Teenage Bounty Hunters,I don’t even understand why it didn’t get a season 2. I can’t imagine that it’s expensive or harder to produce because of covid. It seems like Netflix is becoming a broadcast network.
Teenage Bounty Hunters,"I think Netflix is aware that making second for some TV Series won't make sense financially. 

Because they have 193 million subs and it's growing so why bother. But that will backfire onces other streaming services Start making quality Shows with more than 3 or 4 seasons."
Teenage Bounty Hunters,The politics in this show really turned me off.
Teenage Bounty Hunters,"Fuck Netflix, I’ve had a subscription ongoing for 5 years, I’m done. They keep renewing shit but have cancelled the last two shows I actually even finished in the past year. Fuck Netflix."
Teenage Bounty Hunters,Fuck that. Great show.
Teenage Bounty Hunters,"Cancelled ""Im not okay with this"", Santa Clarita Diet and now this?!?


Netflix used to be the streamer that saved shows, now its the crapstation, what the hell man


I wonder if HBO Max or someone else can bring it back?


Im just 1 person but cancelling my subscription, they dont even have the office anymore at the end of the year"
Teenage Bounty Hunters,Might as well only produce limited series or Anthology shows ...
Teenage Bounty Hunters,Wtf this was honestly my favorite show of the year. Loved the characters.
Teenage Bounty Hunters,"Nobody will read this comment, but this fucking pisses me off. I loved this show: How often is there a sex positive show... about unironically religious people? I'm just commenting to get the comment count higher."
Teenage Bounty Hunters,"Wow. I'm really considering cancelling Netflix. This was one of 2 shows I watched in this year.... Of course they cancel a campy show about fun, empowered and cool teenage girls."
Teenage Bounty Hunters,"I imagine that this show was fairly cheap to make. I didn't recognize an actor in the show at all other than the two girls' dad Im like ""Oh, I recognize him,"" but have absolutely no idea who he is or where I know him from"
Teenage Bounty Hunters,"Hope someone picks it up, but it’s not popular enough to pull a B99... such a shame, it was a great and very creative show!"
Teenage Bounty Hunters,"Damn you, Netflix , damn you all to hell"
Teenage Bounty Hunters,Damn this one was actually pretty good
Teenage Bounty Hunters,motherfuckers.
Teenage Bounty Hunters,"I haven't watched this yet but it was on my list, Netflix should realize that they're a streaming platform at some point and not cancel a show after only releasing it two freaking months ago."
Teenage Bounty Hunters,Guess that means the season cliffhanger is never getting resolved.
The Great Heist,"As much as people like to drag on Matt Lucas, the show's developed a more more system level problem than the hosts.  What started as the joy of watching amateur bakers has become professional level artists struggling to defy time and theromodynamics because Paul went on holiday and became an expert on something."
The Great Heist,"Weird guys like Noel need someone more grounded to play off.  That's why the Noel Matt duo just didn't really click, they were both out there.  Hopefully she brings a bit more balance."
The Great Heist,"They only thing I know her from is the hilarious interview she had with Harrison Ford and Ryan Gosling: https://youtu.be/bAb8KIhgVAI

Seems like a great choice and I can def see a good back and forth with Noel happening."
The Great Heist,Still to this day miss Mel and Sue.
The Great Heist,"I never watched the earlier seasons, but I really grew to love Noel and Sandi. Both of them had such calming voices for the narration, were quick, and honestly quite funny at moments. Losing Sandi for Matt was a huge blow. Hopefully this recaptures some of the magic!"
The Great Heist,"Noel: Welcome back to the Great British Bake Off with our new co-host Alison Hammond, are you excited to be here Alison?

Alison:  HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA"
The Great Heist,I hope they really cut down on the ‘skits’. Last year was brutal.
The Great Heist,"Read through the comments on this, and I’m honestly surprised at all the hate for Matt. Maybe I’m crazy, but I really liked him as a co-host and thought he added a lot to the show."
The Great Heist,Is she the one who had that super fun interview with Harrison Ford and Ryan Gosling during their Blade Runner 2049 press tour?
The Great Heist,"I think it's a good fit. She's warm and cheerful and likeable. But she'll have to dial it down a bit as she has a big personality.

Intrigued to see how she clicks with Noel. Their little comedy bits could be great or could be painfully awkward. Although Noel gets on great with Matt and their little skits were rarely actually funny.

At least she'll be a bright and sunshiney presence. Matt always looked very out of his comfort zone."
The Great Heist,I really liked Noel and Sandi.
The Great Heist,I’m sure he was nice guy but he wasn’t funny. It doesn’t have anything to do with playing off Noel. When he was one on one with contestants he wasn’t funny and lot of what he said just didn’t even make sense. I welcome the change. I miss sandy. She and noel were perfect together.
The Great Heist,Good decision IMO. Matt Lucas didn't suit the show very well and I've no doubt Hammond will fit better.
The Great Heist,I actually really enjoyed Matt. Here's hoping there aren't any more cooking challenges
The Great Heist,"The show was *so good* with Mary Berry and Sue & Mel. Channel 4, unsurprisingly, turned it into complete rubbish."
The Great Heist,"I’ll hold my judgement until i see her in action, but from what I’ve seen of her sees pretty marmite to me."
The Great Heist,"I'll give her a chance but I don't see her having the calm quick wit that made Mel, Sue and Sandi so great, but the show itself needs to address the issues and go back to what made it so popular, good honest baking."
The Great Heist,Long as Noel is there I’m happy
The Great Heist,"A good start to refreshing the show as the last two series have been poor - thanks to odd challenges with impossible deadlines. 

I don't want drama. I just want nice people making yummy things. 

Alison will hopefully bring back the Mummy touch that was missing when Sandi left."
The Great Heist,"I liked Matt Lucas, and i'm not familiar with Alison, but Noel Fielding is the reason I watch the show, so I'm fine with the change."
The Great Heist,Does this mean it'll be less jokey or more jokey?
The Great Heist,"My favorite Matt Lucas moment was when he asked a contestant if they wanted to hear the Flintstones theme song in German, and then recited the entire thing from memory"
The Great Heist,I know it isn’t a popular opinion but I loved how weird Noel and Matt were together. Two wild cards roaming the tent lol
The Great Heist,"I think this is a good move.

I think Matt Lucas did okay but most of the time it felt more like he was just there to goof off and do terrible celebrity impressions.

What I really like about Noel (and all the previous hosts) is that he gets the bakers to feel comfortable and open up a bit and play to the camera, which is what a GBB host’s primary goal should be."
The Great Heist,"ah, man, I didn't like Matt at first but felt like he was really settling in. I'm sure she's gonna be good too though! Maybe one of these days they can get Greg Davies to be a host lol"
The Great Heist,"I love Noel, think he does a great job. While I think Hammond will do just fine and agree Matt had to go, no one will ever live up to Mel and Sue.  IMO."
The Great Heist,Nothing against Matt but I was getting sick of him as a host so this is a welcomed change. Hope they tone down the cringey gimmick intros too. They were cheeky when it was Mel and Sue and now they’re just getting downright embarrassing. Show’s losing a bit of its original spirit.
The Great Heist,"I liked matt in the end, but she's a much better fit"
The Great Heist,"Very happy with this, she is one of the best TV personalities around."
The Great Heist,Goddamn I really dislike Alison Hammond. She's a z tier presenter
The Great Heist,I do love Alison Hammond
The Great Heist,If they had gone with James Acaster I might have actually watched the show just to see it devolve into absolute madness.
The Great Heist,Where will I find my translucent four-limbed egg now?
The Great Heist,Not Nardole!
The Great Heist,I like Matt Lucas well enough. It is a goofy show and he didn't stick out too much. But I guess there are enough people who are not happy with him. As long as Fielding is there I am happy.
The Great Heist,L
The Great Heist,"orite, ya boonch a twonks!"
The Great Heist,I would just like to say that in Canada we are still waiting for season 13 to air. Why do they torture us like this!!!
The Great Heist,I anyone still watching though?
The Great Heist,"“Can’t fire me, I am the only gay in the village!”"
The Great Heist,"I’ve seen her cooking videos, and yes she is chaotically hilarious, this is an upgrade to the show overall imo"
The Great Heist,I love Matt Lucus! They had so much chemistry!
The Great Heist,"This is one of those decisions where once you hear about it, you wonder why it didn't happen years ago."
The Great Heist,[removed]
The Great Heist,I think im the only person in the UK who can’t stand Alison Hammond.
The Great Heist,Aw I liked him :(
The Great Heist,"Sorta glad Matt is fired. Really didn’t find him
In any way funny. Whereas Noel is."
The Great Heist,"Mat was certainly and issue, but they've got deeper problems for the show. Everything is too quick, we don't learn anything about baking anymore i.e no interesting historical facts or little segments about a particular challenge. We don't see Paul and prue offering friendly advice anymore, there hardly seems to be any interaction. Anything that isnt somebody desperately saying ""oh man I'm really having a hard time with this"" or ""well done!"" Seems to be cut out. It's a very barebones show now

Edit: oh and Paul is now a meme. Everything that made it a nice competition show is nearly gone"
The Great Heist,"I don't know much about her, but there's no way she's as bad as Lucas, maybe the least funny person on earth."
The Great Heist,"Seriously?! I finally made it to season 11 of Doctor Who recently and fell in love with Nardole. Prior to watching that season, I wasn't the biggest Matt Lucas fan."
The Great Heist,Wish it was Dawn French instead
The Great Heist,"Absolutely talentless. I cannot understand how she gets work. Years on the tv exposed to so much information and learning and yet seems to be the same imbecilic moron she was on her first day on screen. 

Classic ‘I have no discernible talent but I can make loud noises!’ Broadcaster"
The Great Heist,"Aw, yay! I like her. I think she'll be a good addition to the show. I have to say I really started to despise the way that Matt Lucas was being on the show, I felt like he was directed to be purposely disruptive and he also didn't seem very warm with people, and I didn't find him that funny.  And by the end of the last season I was generally wondering what the point was. I felt like he never settled into the chemistry with Noel or the contestants in the same way that some previous hosts had done."
The Great Heist,As if it wasnt cringey enough already.
The Great Heist,Love this.
The Great Heist,"Too bad, he was hilarious."
The Great Heist,Alison Hammond is not the right fit for this show. Her accent will do no end of people’s heads in.
The Great Heist,Isn't the show called the Great British Baking Show?
The Great Heist,"No real comedians want this gig? It seems like we’re getting screwed with a former reality star, bummer."
The Great Heist,There’ll be nothing left to judge
The Great Heist,WE LOVE GOOD NEWS!
The Great Heist,Matt Lucas is trash.
The Great Heist,idk how Matt Lucas is even around much less on bake off
The Great Heist,Pity bakeoff is dogshit now
The Great Heist,[deleted]
The Great Heist,"well, she does look like someone who knows about cakes and pies"
The Great Heist,Thank GOD. He was so fucking terrible
The Great Heist,"He was never quite right to me…he was funny in Bridesmaids, but I found him to be a little weird on GBBO."
The Great Heist,Thank goodness. Matt was horrible.
The Great Heist,"She's a great fit, very light hearted, funny, always herself and just seems like a nice person."
The Great Heist,"She's gonna be so great with the contestants, looking forward to it :D"
The Great Heist,Alison is AMAZING. What a win.
The Great Heist,"Oooh, I like her.  She's got an amazing personality.  And seems to make everyone feel welcome when she's around."
The Great Heist,Matt Lucas is the first male cast member to ever be replaced.
The Great Heist,Don’t think I’ll ever forgive Matt Lucas for trying to kidnap Abed to England
The Great Heist,Her personality grates on my nerves at the best of times. Hard pass.
The Great Heist,Blackwashing
The Great Heist,Alison Hammond makes my willy go stiff
The Great Heist,[deleted]
The Great Heist,i wonder how creepy bald giant baby looking dude will do with this woman
The Great Heist,This show can do anything and I will still love it and I don't know why. This is my favorite thread I have read all year on Reddit.
The Great Heist,Mega upgrade.
The Great Heist,"I think he was fine, this is just what they do; replace the co host every few seasons."
The Great Heist,Love Matt but looking forward to Alison!
The Great Heist,Thank God.  He is creepy AF.  And not funny.
The Great Heist,"From what I've seen of her, I really like her. I think she'll be amazing at clicking with the contestants who don't necessarily vibe with Noel's sense of humour, which is something we got with Sandi and with Mel and Sue. I think she'll also be even better than Noel at getting a little of the hot air out of Paul, which I think the show badly needs. Matt was fine, but his own brand of absurd. Personally found him a bit off-putting. Like he'd snuck something that doesn't belong anywhere near food into your icing and was just lurking around until you found it. 

Hope the show also goes back to celebrating baking. I'm tired of absurd themed weeks and dishes, toi and of the attitude that what's going on is a little silly. The people in the tent love what they do and they're very good at it. They don't need a host or judge to tell them every few episodes that they ""don't like sweets."" Canadian Bake-Off still has some work to do on being as educational/informative, but it's outpaced the original at highlighting the joy in the process and the product."
The Great Heist,I would like to see Stephen Merchant give it a go as co-host.
The Great Heist,Noel is there I’m happy
The Great Heist,"You need to make a smorgasbord of specific Danish breads that haven’t been eaten since the 14th century, which require 24 hours proofing in Nordic conditions. The runway at Luton is currently melting and you have 25 minutes to do them in.

A few moments later…

Paul: “this isn’t like how they are in Aalborg. I just got back from there, so I’d know. You’ve let them get too warm - it gets quite cold out there. And to top it off, they’re underprooved”

(Although to be fair, the lemon meringue tart challenge was good - simple, easy and no recipe. Just make it)"
The Great Heist,"They never, ever give anyone sufficient time and then complain that they don’t see finished products presented.  They do the same thing on Bake Off: Professionals.  If it takes a certain amount of time to make sure something is baked and then cooled, and then you give them 30 minutes less than that, there is just no way to make that work.

It’s also their insistence on not repeating challenges, so they get more and more complicated and strange.  The all time weirdest was the “cake bust”."
The Great Heist,Taakos!
The Great Heist,Kinda poetic for a studio to take something wholesome and fun and enjoyable for everyone and slowly make it more and more difficult until everyone is struggling and crying and nobody likes it anymore.
The Great Heist,"I still miss Sue and Mell as the hosts. In my opinion the show just became less after the channel 4 move. The comedy sketches that became a thing with Noel, sandy and Matt just aren’t funny to me.  I prefer the banter and interaction between the hosts, judges.

Nowadays I prefer the su2c bake off. It’s less stressful and it’s just joyful to watch."
The Great Heist,"I’m so sick of the rotating hosts. I still miss Sandy, she and Noel has such great chemistry. I don’t care much about the hosts but they do stand out when it’s awkward. It’s been awkward. 

I really miss when it was actual amateur bakers too. I was discussing this with my husband the other day. I call the early bakers “Sarah jane” after one of the contestants, I don’t know why I singled her out. But we’re always saying things like “Sarah Jane could never” when they pull out wild bakes."
The Great Heist,"I rewatched the series and on a early series they had to make *cupcakes*. While I do like challenges that are more interesting than that, each series’ winners are becoming more and more unrelatable (because of their professional-level talent). I want true amateurs goddammit!"
The Great Heist,Agreed!! Tone-deaf cultural weeks and constant striving for new challenges are losing what made the show great.
The Great Heist,They lost me with the smores.
The Great Heist,"A subtle sign of this is how often they show the baker's crying now. Back in the Mel and Sue days, they'd start screaming curse words to prevent the production team from using the footage. Now, you see someone crying almost every episode like any American cooking show. Nobody should be crying on a joyful show."
The Great Heist,Can you elaborate on what has changed for the worse? I’ve watched every season and I still think the show is as great as it’s always been
The Great Heist,If we are being honest the show has never been the same since Mary Berry left.
(Un)Well,"Betty was never supposed to actually be an ugly woman, the title gets at the hatred and perfection obsession in the fashion industry where she works"
(Un)Well,"Two things. 

During the time of the show, it _was_ uncommon to have a plus sized female lead on TV. She had just come off the success of *Real Women Have Curves*, where she was praised for looking unconventional for a lead. 

“Ugly Betty” was the title because that’s how all the extremely attractive people in the fashion world looked at her. The show was about making shallow people less shallow as they got to know Betty. Something something inner beauty."
(Un)Well,"actors act, i don't really see the problem. she did a great job."
(Un)Well,"I hope you're talking about Betty La Fea, the Colombian comedy from the 90s and no, as a Colombian, it was funny as hell and a huge success."
(Un)Well,"Yeah, good point.  But isn't by casting a person who actually fits into the 'perfection obsessed' standard as the 'non-perfect' title character (non-perfect only by virtue of dress, props (glasses, braces), glammed-down) totally undermining that exact point (i.e. 'title gets at the hatred and perfection obsession in the fashion industry')?

Perhaps I'm wrong though."
(Un)Well,"Yes, you are totally right about size.  Hadn't thought of that, maybe because I think she's gorgeous as she is.  Very good point.  Thanks.

Edit to add re your second point:  totally agree that's what the title was getting at  and actually, by those crazy standards, maybe American doesn't actually fit the mold.  So then why make her comically ugly (almost Steve Urkel-esque)...why not keep that nuance.  That America, even as beautiful as she is, is considered 'ugly' in that industry.  

But, maybe I'm wrong--it just missed the mark for me."
(Un)Well,"You're talking about Ana María Orozco, yeah?"
(Un)Well,"Totally agree she did a good job.  And actors act--correct.  Charlize Theron in Monster is a good example of a gorgeous person playing a not-so-attractive character.  No issues.  But the hoopla surrounding that movie wasn't how brave they were for having an 'ugly' main character'.

The whole hoopla around Ugly Betty was that the network was brave...But I just never felt like it was 'brave'...nor groundbreaking.  We've had plenty of nerdy or stereotypically 'not pretty' characters.  They made it like they had broken Hollywood norms with this show...but it was just more of the same.  What would have been 'brave' would be casting someone who wasn't actually stereotypically pretty."
(Un)Well,"No, you definitely have a point. Funny to me that your counterexample is Monster, cause I also remember people saying things like ""they just made a beautiful woman ugly, why is this special?"" I never watched very much Ugly Betty, but I believe part of the storyline was her resisting these superficial changes that would have made her look better, because it wouldn't have been true to herself. Not sure if that helps or hurts the shows case."
(Un)Well,"She’s *not* physically unattractive in the show. She just has braces, glasses, and an unconventional fashion sense.

The thing this show does is, instead of the rich, fabulous popular people giving “Ugly Betty” a makeover like you’d find in other stories, Betty actually makes everyone around her better, giving them inner beauty makeovers, so to speak.

I think you’re getting too hung up on the title, and not the actually content of the show. I haven’t seen it since it aired, but I don’t think anyone in the show actually thought she was ugly."
(Un)Well,"Well, with Monster, the premise and story had nothing to do with the attractiveness of the character and they made Charlize look like the person on whom the movie was based.  There was definitely talk about her being 'brave' for letting herself look like that on screen (disagree-it's acting).  Also, I think people were surmising that she was winning awards not because she was great in the movie, but because of the physical transformation.  So I guess I used that as an counterexample, because I don't  have an issue with making an actress/actor look like something they are not...but in the case of Ugly Betty the entire premise of the show is that the industry (fashion, Hollywood etc) are looks-obsessed--so the network goes 'look at us, we aren't, in fact we aren't so much that we are going to make a show about these harmful obsessions and not only that, we are going to have our main character be ugly...look at us we are soooo progressive and so brave...now for casting, let's play into the exact looks-obsessed industry we are bravely challenging and cast a gorgeous person and then make them unattractive'.  As I write this I'm realizing it also has to do with how they made her unattractive.  They made her ugly in the most parodied way (Steve Urkel-ish)--maybe that was intentional and I'm missing the point, but to me that actually further undermined what they claimed they were trying to do.  Maybe if they had used makeup to make her 'plain' or 'ugly' the way they did Charlize (i.e. it was believable) it wouldn't be as bad because then you'd actually be watching a show with a plain main character.  But here it was almost like 'hey audience, don't worry, she's not actually ugly, so don't change the channel' (in other words they were not only not practicing what they were preaching by casting America, but they weren't being brave at all by making sure the audience was clear that she wasn't actually ugly).

Maybe I don't have better things to do if I'm so annoyed by this afterall lol."
(Un)Well,Well... Here we go again.
(Un)Well,"Last season kind of ended on an implausible note, I wonder how they'll tie that up. "
(Un)Well,"I watched most of the TNBC shows back in the day, but this doesn't look familair. Good to know these shows are on Tubi."
(Un)Well,"I liked it! I enjoyed all the corny teen show NBC had. One World, City Guys, Hang Time. And while I didn't love The New Class, I found it entertaining enough."
(Un)Well,"It was a teen sitcom, not a real sitcom. (Like Saved by the Bell and California Dreams) Teen sitcom is not a genre anymore. It was all fairly sexless. One episode dealt with the dangers of marijuana.

Basically The Fosters is a realer version of it.

It otherwise dealt with real life issues--including black on black discrimination."
(Un)Well,You should definitely check this one out.
(Un)Well,"Yeah I liked New Class more then most did, I also enjoyed Malibu, CA.

I hope Hang Time gets on Tubi soon."
(Un)Well,"what do you mean ""real sitcom""?  That makes no sense.

Not every sitcom with teens has to have sex in it, does not make them any less ""real""."
(Un)Well,"The new class catches a lot of flack but i enjoyed the spin off, it was good. Malibu ca is another good show.

I think they should reboot tnbc."
(Un)Well,"Sitcoms would air during primetime and would get larger ratings. Friends, Fraser, Newsradio..

This was a TNBC show, which basically aired on Saturday mornings on NBC. That's also why there weren't many great gueststars and it's obscure today."
(Un)Well,"a show does not have to air during a certain time for it to be considered a sitcom, I think that's kinda silly, Wikipedia says it's a sitcom and that's good enough for me.

A sitcom does not need big-name guest-stars to be good. Also a sitcom not being super well-known does not automatically make it bad."
(Un)Well,"There is definitely a caste system of TV series.

You can enjoy whatever show you want. But factually some shows are more highly regarded than others."
(Un)Well,"I'm aware, does not mean this show isn't a sitcom though, that's a ridiculous and flat-out untrue statement to make. It factually is one regardless of quality, a show does not have to air in prime-time to be considered a sitcom, that's absolutely ludicrous.

Also you'd be surprised how many people LOVE to hate on Friends these days, I think many would actually prefer to watch TNBC shows over it LOL.

If it's got a laugh track or a studio audience, it's a sitcom. There's really no debate to be had there."
(Un)Well,"Yay! Us Australians don't get Hulu or Amazon or like 80% of American cable networks so it's extremely hard for us to watch what you guys get easily. 

It's good to finally see Australia getting some love and that this wont be a hassle to watch. "
(Un)Well,Such a bizarre way to handle a show.  It confuses me why they would wait so long to release S3 when it was done for so long.  They could and should have aired it last summer/fall and we could be watching S4 right now.
(Un)Well,I watched Season 1 and enjoyed it. Season 2 happened and when it basically became the reality shows it was trying to mock I gave it up really quick. I knew Lifetime would never keep a show good.
(Un)Well,"They did this show dirty.

The hiatus especially, and moving it away from its summer air time.

Pretty dumb.

S3 was better than S2, but S1 still takes the cake. I tell people to skip S2 entirely. 

With it airing in Australia very soon, you know most people are going to find ways to watch it before it gets to Hulu... "
(Un)Well,"Good for us Aussies. I actually never watched the final two episodes of season 3, but I still enjoy UnReal. I should get on that. I'm sure I'll still enjoy season 4.   
I did not know UnReal has apparently had such troubles since season 1.
Stan is actually quite a good streaming service. Not as big a collection of stuff as Netflix, but they have a good library of shows."
(Un)Well,Wait so when is it coming to US Hulu? I’m so confused 
(Un)Well,"Wow. Sad to hear that S4 will be the last. S2 went off-the-rails much in the same way that Riverdale S2 did, but it was still a fun watch for me. S3 did bring it back in line with S1, but I guess it was too little, too late. Well, I hope S4 comes to the U.S. soon so that I can watch it."
(Un)Well,I expected it by fall-ish. Season 4 was filmed and after Hulu airs Season 3 they don't have a reason to wait.
(Un)Well,"This happens to Australians with nearly every other show, you just gotta learn to accept it. "
(Un)Well,"If you think this is bad, don't even ask about Outcast season 2 on Cinemax....."
(Un)Well,Season 4 is also debuting on Amazon Prime Video UK on the July 17th.
(Un)Well,"Sounds like you're acting a bit spoilt to be honest. Should I recount how we in the UK often had to wait weeks or months for shows (or in the cases of some, years - hello Saving Grace - if we got them at all)?

How long will you have to wait until you can see it? "
(Un)Well,They waited until the winter season because of Emmy nominations. Summer shows always get screwed. They wanted a better chance of getting nominated. Lifetime’s schedule works a certain way and that’s how the show fit in best in order to be closest to fit in within the rules for this year’s awards season
(Un)Well,"What didn't you like about season 2? Maybe not their best season, but to recommend to skip it would be devestating in terms of understanding the characters. I'm sure you remember the big reveal about Rachel for example."
(Un)Well,They haven't announced a date yet. But definitely after Stan. 
(Un)Well,"I think you've no idea what you're talking about. I'm not American, I live in Italy.
If no one rips the episodes after they are released on Stan, I'll have to wait until they're released in the US. I don't think the show has even ever aired here in Italy. "
(Un)Well,"I know about the timing for the Emmys - always better to air in Jan-May for that.  But at this point in their run, did they really think they stood a chance of being nominated?  A lot of shows abandon the strategic timing when they realize that they’re not actually contenders."
(Un)Well,"Aside from that reveal, the season is a mess, totally nonsensical. "
(Un)Well,"Apologies, but I'm sure someone will rip it. Maybe not from Australia, you may have to wait until the US broadcast until it gets ripped.

That or see if you can access it from Stan somehow. VPN? "
(Un)Well,"They're contenders for acting noms, which while they don't have a large chance at winning, Constance Zimmer is an almost surefire nomination. "
(Un)Well,I'm having a hard time naming a lot of better contenders for a bunch of Emmy's. Maybe you haven't seen the show? It doesn't look like much from the outside but the drama and acting in this show is something to behold. The critics agree. Shame this show didn't air on a respected network.
(Un)Well,"Someone will definitely rip it when it airs on Hulu.
My post was more about the weirdness of the whole thing rather than a complain. I'm happy that for once the Australians get to see it earlier than the rest of the world. "
(Un)Well,"Come to think of it though, I feel like the ""summer shows get forgotten about"" thing is overblown.  I know I'm backtracking here, but the fact that few summer shows get nominated is probably because the networks *think* that they will get overlooked if they air in the summer.  So consequently, they aim to air their shows in winter/spring.  I mean, Stranger Things got nominated last year despite being a summer show, and Liev Schreiber has been nominated for lead actor in a drama for 3 straight years, despite that Ray Donovan has always been a summer show.  So while I understand that there is the worry of ""being forgotten about"", I think that the actual threat of it is overblown.  I honestly can't think of many examples of clearly deserving shows getting snubbed after airing in the summer - the networks just don't risk it in the first place, so there isn't much data to support the theory (from what I can tell)."
(Un)Well,"I've seen all 3 seasons.  The critical consensus (that I agree with) is that S1 was really good while 2 and 3 had problems despite having some good elements.  The show was never a contender for best drama, even in S1, so I can't see how it could be now.  Constance Zimmer may be up for an Emmy, but the show itself I can't imagine being nominated."
(Un)Well,"Season 1 was pretty popular with critics (and deservedly so, it was great).

Then Marti Noxon left and the show went down the crapper."
(Un)Well,"I enjoyed UnREAL even though, after season 1, they went on a soapy direction. I still watched the show until the very end. I loved Rachel and Quinn."
(Un)Well,Did Adam ever return? I stopped at season 3
(Un)Well,"It’s a fun ‘guilty pleasure’ watch, but nothing particularly great."
(Un)Well,"It fell off so hard after S1, the novelty really wore off. Normally I'd like shows to last longer, but I was so happy S4 was the last."
(Un)Well,"I really enjoyed season 1, but the scene in early season 2 where Rachel forces Madison to ask a contestant if she killed her fiancé made me so uncomfortable that i haven't gone back to it since. I probably will at some point but that moment was just so bad."
(Un)Well,"Loved all of it. Yes, season 2 took it a little too far, but they course-corrected and ended strong."
(Un)Well,Uhm did you meant to say that youre watching less than 10 shows? I think thats pretty normal
(Un)Well,"Well because of the schedule it's usually only 1-3 on at a time. I think with critics lamenting ""peak TV"" and there being too much good TV to watch, some people are quite above that, especially those who watch Netflix shows which I don't."
(Un)Well,thanks for the clarification. you have neber watched any netflix original at all?
(Un)Well,"I've tried watching a lot of them, I just think they're bad"
(Un)Well,mh i wouldnt say they are bad but id agree that there arent really netflix original masterpieces

Love it.

Good show.

No opinion."
(Un)Well,I love Miami Vice but anyone who actually thinks it’s a good show hasn’t really watched it in full. It’s fun but nothing incredible
(Un)Well,No it isn’t
(Un)Well,"New Who is good although in recent years it’s really lost the plot to the point I don’t consider a lot of the more recent episodes canon

As for anime, I tend to prefer older stuff, though I do enjoy some newer works"
(Un)Well,It’s fucking brilliant
(Un)Well,">New Who is good although in recent years it’s really lost the plot to the point I don’t consider a lot of the more recent episodes canon

When Moffat became showrunner the show took a massive nosedive. Matt was a good doctor but the writing was awful for his seasons. Capaldi was okay but I gave up during his run completely.

>As for anime, I tend to prefer older stuff, though I do enjoy some newer works

Yeh older and newer anime do tend to have a very different feel. I found it interesting you listed the original Dragon Ball as I don't usually hear that one talked about much. As for AOT for me it became something special during the later seasons."
(Un)Well,"Is there a sub for this show?

I concur - best show I've seen in some time.

I dunno, I definitely had some deep laughs every episode. I think it does comedy exceedingly well."
(Un)Well,"> a lot of hyperbole 

I haven't gotten to that episode yet, but I'm ***really, really, really, really*** enjoying this show so far."
(Un)Well,This is how [real adults](https://my.mixtape.moe/eftute.mp4) deal with negotiations and conflict resolution situations.
(Un)Well,what's this show about ?
(Un)Well,"I laugh heartily every 10 minutes. 

The first ep is a bit rough but very entertaining. "
(Un)Well,"Just finished it. You're absolutely right. I was a little miffed at the very last moments of the ending but that's because I absolutely hate first seasons that end the way Patriot did. 

It was a fantastic ten episodes. "
(Un)Well,"I don't know if it has it's own sub. I looked in here and didn't see anything at first, but someone posted about it earlier. The funniest part for me was when Dennis was talking about twins. ""They creep me out a little."""
(Un)Well,"""stoner spy comedy"", hard to describe but totally worth the trip"
(Un)Well,Intelligence agent posing as a process engineer at a piping company in Milwaukee so he can get into Iran. 
(Un)Well,"Yeah, I didn't care for the ending too much, they better have a second season. :)"
(Un)Well,I loved it. John's depression is impossible to escape from.
(Un)Well,"[Spoiler](#s ""Yeah, they make us carry it. - Cool Rick in response to John saying his Attaché badge is 'cool' "")"
(Un)Well,"death and red forman are in it, nice"
(Un)Well,Still the best depiction of male depression on television
(Un)Well,Used to watch it with my sister when she was a teenager and I was a young boy. She had a crush on Dexter Fletcher. I was smitten with Julia.
(Un)Well,"I watched this for the first time last January, really really loved it. I'd expected to like it, but I figured it might be a bit more overtly dated or childish - but nope, not at all. Fantastic stuff - probably Moffat's best ensemble cast."
(Un)Well,"I've been rewatching it myself recently.

I can't think of a live action TV series like it. It fills all these criteria

* made for kids
* predominantly performed by kids
* almost all excellent child actors
* never talks down to its audience
* none of the kids are ""geniuses""
* none of the kids are mindless simpletons
* has an actually disabled actor playing a disabled person
* intelligently covers such topics as

* * teenage suicide
* * drug addiction
* * child sexual abuse
* * responsibly dealing with the consequences of poor decisions

There are very few stories where the children solving the dilemma is contrived.

For its time, it was groundbreaking, and deserved more attention than it got. It only didn't because the intended audience were under voting age. 

I am a tad biased, as I had a massive crush on Julia Sawalha when the show came out."
(Un)Well,"I definitely think that a lot of the things Moffat would do in, for instance, *Doctor Who* are foreshadowed in *Press Gang*. Stuff like the episode ""Chance Would Be a Fine Thing"" where Kenny is trying to get back in touch with an Irish girl he became infatuated with in a previous episode when he kept dialling a wrong number and getting her, not realising she happens to be in town and, because he never actually saw her face, he doesn't recognise her even when she comes to his door. Throw a Dalek in there and you've got an episode of *Doctor Who*."
(Un)Well,"I was thinking of mentioning in the OP that you couldn't make this show today and demurred because when you say that, people think you're a ""political correctness gone mad"" sort, which I'm not. 

But I do think it's true, something like *Press Gang* probably *couldn't* get made today, because I think the standards of television aimed at its target audience have fundamentally *changed* in a way I can't really articulate. (I feel that *Children's Ward* was similar, but I've not seen *Children's Ward* in a good long while so I may not be remembering it accurately.)

It's like, compare Russell T Davies's most recent sci-fi show for children (*The Sarah Jane Adventures*) with his *first* sci-fi shows for children (*Dark Season*, *Century Falls*). Those are all great shows (especially *Dark Season*) but despite them all ostensibly having the same target audience in mind, *Sarah Jane Adventures* somehow *feels* like it's pitching younger in a way that I can't fully articulate. 

What's the fundamental difference between kids' tv in 1992 versus kids' tv in 2022, I wonder? For that matter, what's the fundamental difference between the kids watching stuff then and watching stuff now? I certainly don't know."
(Un)Well,"Oh yeah, loved that episode"

Kongsuni and Friends,"I think one of the things that give Seinfeld an edge is that the characters are never presented as good people. They're all shitty and that's part of it. So things that might have been considered benign at the time, but don't  age well are easier to shrug off. Friends continually tries to tell you they're good people and good friends when they're all actually terrible so they just become worse over time."
Kongsuni and Friends,"Seinfeld just seemed to have so many things that relate to life in general. Odd given the nature of the show, but I'm always using ""like on Seinfeld"". Double dip, man hands, not that there's anything wrong with it, regifter, opposite George, etc. 

Cripes, just yesterday I saw a dumpster diver eating a donut from the trash and thought of George."
Kongsuni and Friends,"“We’re not gay! …Not that there’s anything wrong with that.” 

So many lines were ahead of their time and hold up well."
Kongsuni and Friends,Seinfeld by far. To me the cynicism holds up better than the corny sentimentality where everybody hugs and learns a lesson.
Kongsuni and Friends,"Seinfeld, it’s indisputable"
Kongsuni and Friends,Now start watching Curb your Enthusiasm
Kongsuni and Friends,Seinfeld and it's not close. Seinfeld has always been a better show imo.
Kongsuni and Friends,Seinfeld has aged better because a lot of the stories are based on every day real life situations. How many times has something happened in your life that made you think of a Seinfeld episode vs how many times has something made you think of Friends?
Kongsuni and Friends,"I still love both these shows, and I think they both hold up. 

Friends hit its stride at the end of season 3, when Ross and Rachel really broke up. It seems the writers shifted all the characters into quirky, weird characteristics besides Ross being the lovelorn mopey guy, Monica being the straight woman, Chandler being just a comic relief, etc. This ended up giving the show refreshing storylines to feed off of as opposed to the cookie cutter sitcom it started as.

Seinfeld is similar in that it hit its real stride a few seasons in. All of the characters were gloriously unlikeable yet lovable, but I think Elaine was the real gem in the bunch. I always thought it was pretty brave for JLD to play such a brash character, for a woman comedian it was really refreshing to see her be just as bad as the guys as opposed to being the straight woman trying to keep them in check. Sweet Dee on Sunny is directly influenced by her portrayal. 

Each of these shows have catch phrases that are a part of pop culture, each show is still funny despite knowing what that joke is that you heard for the 20th time. Both are classics, but different types of shows that went against the grain and ended up becoming classics."
Kongsuni and Friends,[removed]
Kongsuni and Friends,"It’s highly subjective. 

Growing up with friends felt a lot more digestible and easier to follow. The narcissism of Seinfeld didn’t become clear to me until i was older and able to understand the situation the characters were placed in.

Friends storylines felt a lot more simplified. Universal storytelling vs situational experiences.

Both hold space where needed. 

Overall, for me - Friends aged well as a comfort watch and Seinfeld aged best with personal experiences."
Kongsuni and Friends,"Seinfeld ages better because it fused one of the greatest comedy writers ever (Larry David) with three of the greatest performers of their time (Alexander, Richards, Dreyfuss)
No, I didn’t leave out any names here."
Kongsuni and Friends,"One is the greatest network comedy ever.

the other is Friends.

IMO the writing on Seinfeld was so far ahead of the game people are still catching up."
Kongsuni and Friends,"Ngl. Its interesting seeing some of the replies here as a person from the UK. Seinfeld barely got much of a chance to get going here (dont blame the people, blame the channels over here messing up schedules MAJOR at the time), whereas Friends was and is still HUGE here. Like there's legit a small chain of central perk replica coffee shops here within one of the biggest fashion stores here and you can find friends merch anywhere. 

Like due to that Seinfeld has always felt like this weird hipster show for friends haters to me. ""Oh, you like friends? That's so basic and mainstream. Seinfeld is way better."" and I know elsewhere in the world ESPECIALLY in the US it isn't true. But yeah... its just the way it feels and looks from this side if the planet. 😅"
Kongsuni and Friends,The funny one.
Kongsuni and Friends,"Lot of Friends hate one here. But honestly, They’re both really great shows that have aged pretty brilliantly. 

One took the sitcom formula and pretty much perfected it. The other took the sitcom formula and found hilarious ways to subvert it. Both shows were exceptionally cast.

I feel like Reddit seems to look at Friends as being hokey and sentimental, but it’s no worse than Parks and Reck and The Office US in that regard and the writing in those early seasons especially was really fresh and clever."
Kongsuni and Friends,Seinfeld is more farcical and Friends has a bit more heart. Maybe I’m getting softer as I get older but I gravitate more towards Friends.
Kongsuni and Friends,"People on here have such a huge hate boner for Friends lol

There's a reason it's as popular as it is"
Kongsuni and Friends,"Asking reddit to choose between Friends and Seinfeld is a forgone conclusion, the reddit demo will always favor Seinfeld. But if you were to ask randoms on the street, Friends will win out 8 times out of 10.

I like them both but Friends is my comfort show and the one I have rewatched more often."
Kongsuni and Friends,"Have 30 somethings at my work place that watch Friends over and over.  One says she has seen every episode at least 15 times.  Seinfeld was smarter and has more memorable lines, but younger generations have not discovered it like they have discovered Friends.  Both funny as hell."
Kongsuni and Friends,"My vote is for Seinfeld. But Im going to selfishly take this opportunity to stick up for Friends and fight back against the the online hate that show brings in. 

I am old enough to have appreciated the later seasons live as they aired and to be aware of what a massive phenomenon it was in its day. It was everyone’s favorite show (if I may generalize). I watched all the reruns at 6 and 6:30 every day. By the time the show finished I probably saw the whole series 2 or 3 times over. then I got older and went through the phase of thinking it was uncool, unfunny, and out dated. Then I got even older and it was released on HBO Max and I decided to get nostalgic and start from episode 1. The show is a monumental achievement in entertainment. They created SIX ICONIC characters over 10 seasons with a joke-a-minute prime time sitcom. The actors delivered every time. The roles they played were not easy. If you can’t laugh at Friends then that’s on purpose and you’re just trying to be a contrarian hipster who just won’t like any multicam sitcom. But if you can appreciate the format at all, let go of ego, Friends is funny. 

Seinfeld is better tho 🤷🏻‍♂️"
Kongsuni and Friends,"I don’t even see how the two can compare - friends is a good sitcom, but very low hanging fruit comedy that comes together with likable characters and typical “will they, won’t they” tropes, where as Seinfeld is legit great writing, had timeless jokes, unique characters, and paved the way for shows with terrible characters that have little to no development while still maintaining audience interest.  Just one man’s opinion."
Kongsuni and Friends,"I like both shows, but objectively speaking, I think Seinfeld is far superior.

It just has way more creativity and unique premises and I think writing is superior. Friends is a good sitcom, but I don’t think it necessarily has anything that sets it apart from most other sitcoms as its own thing besides the fountain dancing intro titles and music. I too watched Friends first and thought it was one of the greatest shows ever, but then started seeing Seinfeld and newer shows like Community and Parks and Rex and saw how superior they are.

Seinfeld didn’t need a famous guest star every week, but I think Friends purposely went that route in the latter half largely because I think they knew the writing and characters weren’t strong enough to succeed on its own and triedmto overcompensate with big name guest stars like Willis, Pitt, DeVito, Penn and, Kathleen Turner and Goldblum, among others.

Friends was and is a very ordinary - but entertaining- sitcom with a flashy exterior and good jokes, but didn’t have the substance the way Seinfeld or Parks and Rec or Community or Frasier and many others do. It was always a fun show but I don’t think much more than that."
Kongsuni and Friends,Friends is 100x more popular and gets more views. So depends what you want to take into account. This is kinda like avatar where reddit thinks avatar/friends suck but the majority of the world loves avatar/friends.
Kongsuni and Friends,"I realize I am really going to cut against the grain here, but I have to answer this question truthfully:

Friends, and it is not even close.

I’m not saying it’s better than Seinfeld because it totally is NOT. But OP said “aged better.” 

I live in NYC and I work in tourism. The number of people I’ve met who are desperate to see the Friends apartment, Friends locations real and fake (no, Central Perk is not a real coffee shop), extends into the hundreds.

I’ve not met a single person who asks me about Seinfeld.

All those Friends fanatics? They are all 20 or younger.

Friends is MASSIVELY popular among Gen Z kids, who find it alternately relatable (because stories are simple and the characters are very archetypal) and exotic (no smartphones or social media, and the characters on Friends not-so-coincidentally seem to have much richer relationships with each other).

Friends has resonated in a major, major way a generation later. Seinfeld has not. Seinfeld is much more specific in its humor and more rooted in 90s history (don’t know who George Steinbrenner and Johnnie Cochran were? Too bad for you!), and I don’t think its very white/Jewish-centric vision of New York, where other ethnicities are typically encountered in service industries or as exotic Others, has aged well for 2020s sensibilities. Does Friends have the white-centric problem, too? Hell yes, even more so, but its edges so sanded and its humor so seemingly benign that I can see why people give it more of a pass.

TL, DR: Friends has a huge Gen Z fanbase, Seinfeld does not. Ergo, Friends has “aged better”, though I agree Seinfeld was a much, much better show."
Kongsuni and Friends,"Controversial certainly reading the rest of this thread, but I regularly still rewatch Friends, while very little of the humor in Seinfeld does anything for me. (I also love always sunny, which people often compare Seinfeld to).

I think Friends holds up not because of the humor, but in spite of it, it's a very feel good show, it always works out for them and a lot of the struggles are relatable to a 20-30 year old trying to be a grown-up for the first time. When I'm in a bad mood and am ""stuck in second gear"", then it kind of cheers me up, but Seinfeld doesn't do that, and I'd rather watch Always Sunny for the fun hijinks with the absurd stories and bonkers characters, when I'm in the mood for that."
Kongsuni and Friends,"*Seinfeld* influenced modern comedy more than *Friends* - Larry David shaped a generation of White guys' sense of humor.
  
*Friends* benefits from having some post-9/11 seasons and just *feels* more modern. Rachel also influenced a whole generation of White girls' wardrobe."
Kongsuni and Friends,"Seems a lot people here aren’t answering the question. They’re just answering what do they prefer. As for me, I think Friends has aged better. Seinfeld is a 90s show in its references. Which makes sense obviously as it was almost solely set in the 90s. As someone else said, I think Friends benefits in relation to this question from having some of it set past 9/11, when the world was a different place."
Kongsuni and Friends,"Never liked Seinfeld, might be an American thing I never understood. 

Friends was funny at times and woudn't be suprised if some channels sti air episodes. Just like married with children stil airs -.-"
Kongsuni and Friends,"This is such a weird argument. One show is a literal milestone of television comedy, the other is a show lots of people seem to enjoy. 

Apples and oranges."
Kongsuni and Friends,Reddit leans Seinfeld. But they’re both great
Kongsuni and Friends,Seinfeld is funnier to me now as I’m at the age of the characters. Friends was never funny to me regardless of age.
Kongsuni and Friends,Seinfeld and it's not particularly close. Seinfeld vs Frasier is a better question.
Kongsuni and Friends,"Also Kevin Bright who made Friends is a huge asshole. He was an alumni of my school and came around all the time. He always introduced himself as “the guy who made Friends,”… he complained that he didn’t work on sets anymore because everyone was too Pc and wouldn’t let him give them unsolicited massages… and when he would come as a guest for our annual awards show, there had to be a special student assigned to him to make sure he didn’t act creepy to any women."
Kongsuni and Friends,Seinfeld. Friends is just white Living Single
Kongsuni and Friends,"Whichever people choose, I’d say they’re both white."
Kongsuni and Friends,"One invented No Nut November, the other still gets people to clap along to a theme song"
Kongsuni and Friends,"Everything in this thread saying Friends isn’t funny to seem smarter than they are 🙄. Seinfeld is the better show, but the Friends writers room wasn’t slacking and the cast was also great."
Kongsuni and Friends,"For the average person probably friends, for redditors, its always seinfeld"
Kongsuni and Friends,"Seinfeld is the obvious answer. Friends is a relic of that old hokey manufactured sitcom vibe. While definitely a more modern take, it has more in common with Cheers than with modern TV.

Seinfeld was so innovative in its style that people literally referred to it as a show about nothing. When you really think about that, it is bizarre. At that time, people needed each episode wrapped in a convenient storyline that taught a lesson to actually perceive storytelling. Seinfeld blew up that notion and allowed characters to exist as morally ambiguous without being ""punished"" (and then when they did get ""punished"" in the finale, the audience felt betrayed). Storylines were less cliched and more based on the small minutia of everyday life and poking holes in the absurdity of modern society -- basically the default tone of most social media platforms these days. It isn't that crazy to draw a line from Seinfeld's take on character to the beginning of prestige TV like The Sopranos and The Wire, when TV audiences finally accepted that it is far more interesting to not be force fed whether a character is a hero or a villain."
Kongsuni and Friends,"Contrary to everyone here, Friends. Seinfeld has far too many pop culture references that someone not from that era wouldnt understand. I was born in the 90s and I don't even get some of the people/references they say. There's no damn way a person born now would get a lot of the jokes. Don't get me wrong, Seinfeld is far better written but it's humor also has a long set up, whereas Friends is that cheap easy humor. You'd actually need to watch a whole episode of Seinfeld and pay attention to it in order to get the payoff, whereas Friends you could leave on the background and still enjoy it."
Kongsuni and Friends,"Seinfeld, always. The show is/was brilliant and could never be replicated."
Kongsuni and Friends,Seinfeld. Although I would say Curb is the one that will age like a fine wine.
Kongsuni and Friends,"Friends is what Seinfeld would have been if the network had been calling all the development shots: get a couple more girls, make everyone younger and pretty, include a Sam and Diane couple. Given that, Friends was executed very well."
Kongsuni and Friends,Mulva > Unagi
Kongsuni and Friends,I always found Seinfeld to be more relatable.
Kongsuni and Friends,"As a HUGE Seinfeld fan, I was pretty pissed when people started comparing these two shows a little while back. In my mind it was even close.

My wife started watching friends again, and I have to admit, it was way better then I remembered. Definitely, not as good as Seinfeld, but it was closer then I thought.

Seinfeld 10/10

Friends 9/10"
Kongsuni and Friends,There are rarely days that go by that are not relatable to Seinfeld. It is infinitely more quotable. Seinfeld has a timeless quality that is not matched by Friends. Seinfeld and The Office is a better comparison.
Kongsuni and Friends,Seinfeld. Better jokes.
Kongsuni and Friends,I watched Friends and loved it for years and then found Seinfeld in 2020 and there simply isn't any comparison for me - Seinfeld is far superior and I love it dearly and watch it every day. I'm bonkos about Seinfeld 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Kongsuni and Friends,"Seinfeld was more realistic in their living situation, such as not being able to afford these huge apartments on minimal salary etc. 

Oh and Seinfeld had actual comedy ..."
Kongsuni and Friends,"ITT, Seinfeld good, Friends bad."
Kongsuni and Friends,"Seinfeld, by far.  It's always relatable and always hilarious.  Friends was good too but the characters are just so.........likeable.  The UN-likability of Seinfeld's characters makes it timeless."
Kongsuni and Friends,Friends is really unfunny. It tries too hard and falls flat; the humour is so forced. It also feels dated. Seinfeld is timeless. Far superior on every front.
Kongsuni and Friends,"Seinfeld and the Episode in the Hampton’s — have not seen anything better in comedy after that — Seinfeld is the GOAT 😊

Please, you have to see the baaaabbbyyyy 😅"
Kongsuni and Friends,"Seinfeld embraced being terrible people and that was part of the appeal (IASIP does this well, too). Friends characters didn’t seem horrible at the time but in retrospect they’re unbearable."
Kongsuni and Friends,"how is this even a question? seinfeld by faaaarrr

friends is a show set in new york fucking city and it features ONLY white people. wtf is that?"
Kongsuni and Friends,Seinfeld is the Goat!!
Kongsuni and Friends,I think both are for different crowds. You probably won't ever get an unbiased answer. Not that there's anyone wrong with that!
Kongsuni and Friends,"Friends was never funny, All the actors are now washed up and trying to stay relevant. Didnt the show try to reboot and flop? I dont think I've ever met anyone who actually liked the show and wasnt above the age of 40. And that was a long time ago.

everyone I know who has seen sienfeld still loves it, and my family and I watch it together sometimes. Even though it can be mundane and dated at times, it still holds up really well"
Kongsuni and Friends,Seinfeld by far. I used to be a staunch friends stan when I was a teenager but damn it's near unwatchable now.
Kongsuni and Friends,"Friends =  characters have redeeming values.

Seinfeld = no one has any redeeming values. 

Seinfeld all day."
Kongsuni and Friends,Seinfeld. Friends has always been trash.
Kongsuni and Friends,"Since Seinfeld was WAY better while it aired, it’s also better now. That’s my crazy take."
Kongsuni and Friends,"You’re asking this on the internet, my friend. The overwhelming consensus is going to be Seinfeld. By a wide margin."
Kongsuni and Friends,"friends comes off super fake now. they also seem much older then they are. 
its bizarre to me that ""a show about nothing"" was an unheard of concept and i suppose at the time ahead of its time. even though i thought seinfeld was lame (i didnt get it) as a kid its aged better. 
although it was hilarious that teens thought friends was a new netflix show. then target ruined everything by merchandising it to DEATH"
Kongsuni and Friends,"Friends turned into a bunch of Adults acting like dumb teens living in conditions they can't effort with their incomes in a New York that doesn't exist as they present it while handling unrelatable shit in unrealistic ways. I never liked friends and personally find it one of the most overrated shows in the history of television. Seinfeld however is very relatable and realistic which besides the set feeling outdated (yet good for the time they made it) making it sort of a timeless show, the jokes and situations still work."
Kongsuni and Friends,"I like them both. Friends is too nostalgic for me. But Seinfeld probably ages the best as it is a show about nothing. :D

Also, my fav sitcom from the ""old days"" is probably Fraiser. Seen it first time few years back and it is amazing."
Kongsuni and Friends,"Seinfeld is still relevant. Everyone has had a bad parking experience or been ""Happy New Year""'ed in Feb."
Kongsuni and Friends,Seinfeld. By miles
Kongsuni and Friends,Sinefield.  Curb is still a great show with a similar concept.
Kongsuni and Friends,Seinfeld is timeless and still holds up. Friends is almost unwatchable now.
Kongsuni and Friends,Friends was shit when it came out
Kongsuni and Friends,"Well I've never liked Friends in the first place. 

But Seinfeld is immortal. It's a much more human show."
Kongsuni and Friends,"Friends has some very dated jokes. Seinfeld has some dated situations (the speed dial episode for example), but the humor is timeless."
Kongsuni and Friends,"In my mind there doesn’t need to be a debate as to which is better. I like both shows.

There’s a lot of dislike for Friends here. I don’t know. I think it’s very funny."
Kongsuni and Friends,"A lot of Seinfeld was dealing with issues that wouldn't happen anymore, like waiting at a land line for a call or misunderstandings that we instantly solve with a smartphone. Friends was a bunch of people trying to fuck. I think Seinfeld is a way better show but it hasn't aged as well"
Kongsuni and Friends,"Seinfeld, without question.

Even though it's a 90s show about 30 somethings, it's still so applicable today and to a broad audience.

I've watched it over and over again throughout the years since I was 12 years old. I'm now approaching 30 and I know all the lines by now, and I'm still laughing and hollering at every episode. It's not like it even had just a few good episodes or seasons, there's so many classics! Heck the festivus episode was in the final season! 

It's just the all-time best comedy show and will always be my all-time favorite TV show. 

FRIENDS is probably only better to a certain demographic."
Kongsuni and Friends,"One good way is to compare similar episodes. The classic Seinfeld episode about masturbation famously used “master of my domain” as a euphemism to get around network censors. The episode humorously explored the central role that it plays in our lives and differences between men and women, cleverly couched in a friendly contest. A masterpiece of sitcom writing.

The Friends episode “The one about whacking off” is much cruder. The scene where Ross and Chandler are racing to see who finishes on Joey first lacks the nuances of the Seinfeld contest. And the lack of a comparable scene with the girls smacks of early 90s sexism.

Overall it’s very clear which was the greater comedy."
Kongsuni and Friends,"Seinfeld.

The premise of Friends was created by an 8 year old girl. Me and my friends are all going to live in the same place and we can play everyday. Our boyfriends will live in the same building and we can all date when we want too. And everything is going to be really really fun."
Kongsuni and Friends,Friends is for the undateable.
Kongsuni and Friends,It’s Seinfeld by a mile. Haven’t watched Friends in quite a while but it doesn’t strike me as the type of show that would’ve aged well. Seinfeld is still funny as shit. And relevant.
Kongsuni and Friends,"Friends, but it’s not necessarily because it’s a better show. So many shows have taken what Seinfeld did and built on it or downright stolen from it.

As a person who has watched both, I laugh more at Friends. When I watch Seinfeld, I understand that it is funny, but I’m able to predict where it’s going because modern sitcoms have been shaped by it to the point that my thought process is able to jump to the punchline before it happens on screen. 

This is so common that there’s a whole page on TV Tropes about it: https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeinfeldIsUnfunny"
Kongsuni and Friends,"Seinfeld, 100%"
Kongsuni and Friends,Seinfeld. The jokes are actually still funny. Friends..... not so much.
Kongsuni and Friends,I don't find Seinfeld even remotely funny.  Maybe it's because I'm British?
Kongsuni and Friends,I never cared for Seinfeld.
Kongsuni and Friends,"Seinfeld’s characters are not sympathetic. We like them in spite of who they are. Friends’s characters are by comparison very sympathetic. We like them in spite of what they *do*.

I think the easiest comparison is how each show handles the rampant homophobia of the 90s. Friends leans fully into it, with all the characters unabashedly making gay jokes. When Seinfeld did the same topic, they added ‘not that there’s anything wrong with it.’ The characters are aware they’re in the wrong on Seinfeld and on Friends they are not aware they are."
Kongsuni and Friends,Friends is living single for white people. Seinfeld is very good but dated and doesnt resonate with gen z like friends does. The real GOAT 90s sitcom will always be Frasier.
Kongsuni and Friends,"Friends. When was the last time you saw Seinfeld bath salts for sale?

Friends is the ultimate American style sitcom, while Seinfeld is a B+ approximation of a British style sitcom (which is why it never had an impact there). Friends is a huge global property and I guarantee at least one episode is screening on TV somewhere as you read this. Seinfeld not so much. What’s up with that? Could it *be* any clearer?"
Kongsuni and Friends,"Jerry this is frank, mr steinberger is here, George is dead, call me back.

This line alone is better than friends"
Kongsuni and Friends,Friends has a better looking cast and is a brighter show. Those things always age better as comfort watches.
Kongsuni and Friends,Sienfield is much better.
Kongsuni and Friends,From reading the comments it looks like I’ll be binge watching Seinfeld . 😊
Kongsuni and Friends,Workaholics… I said what I said.
Kongsuni and Friends,"Seinfeld is 10000x better than Friends. Even when Friends was on tv it wasn’t very funny. Seinfeld works because it deals with very real everyday themes but through the experiences of intentionally unlikeable characters. It’s about the discomfort of social interaction, the perpetual adolescence encouraged by urban life, the mundaneness of most work, the sheer amount of luck involved in finding jobs, family relationships… Friends characters tried to be likeable but were totally unbelievable because of it. They’re all beautiful and fashionable, whereas the cast of Seinfeld is fairly average looking (well Elaine is gorgeous but she dresses in a very particular way and has naturally curly hair and her real nose etc). Friends characters had mostly low paying jobs but rarely talked about money, whereas Seinfeld had entire episodes about finding good deals on rent. George had to move in with his parents when he was unemployed. It just feels more relatable. The fat Monica jokes on friends are really tasteless and cruel. Jokes about George Constanza being portly and bald feel very human—his value is not fully attributed to his attractiveness, he still dates and gets laid, and when women reject him it typically has more to do with his personality and poor behavior than his appearance. Friends was accused of being too white for NYC but I don’t think ever responded to that. Seinfeld, with the same accusation, made a hilarious episode about George trying to find a Black friend to prove he wasn’t racist. The writing in Seinfeld is just…excellent. I could go on and on about it, but I think it’s no contest at all. Friends was a blah sitcom that aged poorly. Seinfeld was an excellent sitcom with great writing, and while some jokes don’t make sense with current technology (eg stealing answering machine tapes), it doesn’t really matter."
Kongsuni and Friends,"I feel like FRIENDS has aged a tiny bit better. Let me explain.


FRIENDS is a show about a group of friends going through life, from early 20s to real adulthood with complicated relationships, kids, etc. A ton of the writing still holds up IMO. The negative of the show is that its VERY typical sitcom. A bit formulaic, especially in later seasons. But we do get to see the characters grow, develop, without compromising TOO much on what made them funny. Joey and Feebie are probably the only 2 characters that suffered a ton of Flanderisation.

SEINFELD on the other hand has MUCH sharper writing and the humor is a lot more nuanced. Where SEINFELD drops the ball is that its very much a product of its time. Half of the show would not work if the characters had smartphones. Simple as that. I mean, come on dudes, there is a whole episode revolving around swapping the cassette of an answering machine. 

This is all objective in my opinion tho. I personally enjoyed Seinfeld humor a lot more. Some of the jokes take a whole episode to be set up, with a payoff as the last line of the episode. That's not easy to pull off. And this is from a guy who grew up on Friends when it was airing. I only caught SEINFELD on Netflix. Also, George Costanza is a spirit animal and one of the most glorious characters to ever grace a TV screen"

Moesha,"Adopted kid (now adult) here - loved LOVED LOVED Sister-Sister! Gave me hope I had a long lost twin. 


I didnt."
Moesha,"Sister Sister was so good! It lost its way a little when they became ‘cool’ though.  I liked them being dorky.

I’d put it up there with Sabrina and Teen Angel."
Moesha,"Sweet, love the classic UPN lineup"
Moesha,"This is great news , most of these shows didn't even get a DVD release."
Moesha,No Martin? Fuck.
Moesha,"I wanted Family Matters ;/ 

But I guess I have enough DVR'd on YTTV anyway"

Moesha,"Grew up watching this stuff, Ill probably ignore it with the rest of the stuff on Netflix as I rewatch starship troopers."
Moesha,Eyyyy!!! Put in Wayans Brothers and Jamie Foxx in there too please
Moesha,"For all the 1990s-nostalgia we’ve been getting, one thing that was not joining along was the R&B/Black sitcom shows from the WB/UPN from that era. Never figured out why."
Moesha,"I never realized how much I missed shows like *Moesha*, *The Game*, *The Parkers* and *Sister Sister* until this was announced. This is going to make staying at home a little bit more bearable as it will be very refreshing to be able to watch these shows on demand. I can't even remember the last time I've watched any of them. Great news!"
Moesha,"I’m excited for this! I used to love Girlfriends, and never knew why it wasn’t streaming. Can’t wait to do a rewatch"
Moesha,"Still no In Living Color, bummer"
Moesha,I feel like In the House should have been on this list.
Moesha,UPN is coming back
Moesha,Heeeeeyyyyyyy professa ogleveeeeeeee!!!!
Moesha,"When I was a kid, I would watch One on One because i had a crush on Kyla Pratt. Didn't like the show at all. But I liked Kyla Pratt.

I used to watch the show Girlfriends almost every Sunday night too. Hated that show, but damn dude. I didn't have cable and there was nothing else on. This was before you could just find any movie or show online. Like a few years before that era started. All the other channels had were infomercials around that time or the news. I think I was in my first year of college or it could have been late high school, I can't even remember honestly. But just thinking about that show right now fills me with the opposite of nostalgia. it fills me with dread. I'm dead inside now days, but holy crap, those days were dreadful. I was failing my college classes. I didnt want to be in school. No direction. Everything just sucked until I started working with my friends.

I remember Moesha being alright. It would come on when i was in middle school and high school I think It'd be on after school and I'd watch it after Toonami was over or Dragon Ball Z was over. I remember it always being Sailor Moon then Dragon Ball Z then Reboot and then some other show I can't remember. But then when they started Gundam shows after DBZ, i'd just watch something else. Eventually they changed up to be Sailor Moon, Dragon Ball, and then Dragon Ball Z and some other shows I think. 

I saw glimpses of the other shows, but never watched them that much. i'm a black guy, but none of these shows ever appealed to me. The ""black shows"" that did appeal me were Smart Guy, Steve Harvey Show (the sitcom), My Brother and Me, Family Matters, the Sinbad Show, Good Times, Sanford and Son, Fresh Prince, My Wife and Kids, A Different World, Bernie Mac Show (i dont think this is considered s sitcom though?), Jeffersons, Waynes Bros, Jamie Foxx Show, That's So Raven, What's Happening, Hanging with Mr Cooper, Kenan and Kel, In the House, On Our Own, The Hughleys, and so many more. 

Every 90's kid needs to experience My Brother and Me. ALL the episodes are on Youtube. Download them for later because they'll probably be taken down. here's a random episode: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI1itsIg32Y It's made of pure 90's."
Moesha,Wow I’m surprised Netflix was able to get some of these shows. I guess we have to thank the streaming wars alongside the people for this one.
Moesha,"I'm so excited for the game, but disappointed its only the first 3 seasons. Hopefully they are working on getting the remaining seasons that were on bet."
Moesha,Great news. Wish they could add Living Single too.
Moesha,"Man I really wish they would have decided to put on Sister, Sister first but I'll take Moesha with no complaints."
Moesha,P.S. Check this box if you like Moesha[ _ ]

Moesha,"I had a really bad vertigo episode and stupidly went to an urgent care (it's stupid because they didn't do anything for me and told me if it got worse to go to the ER), and while I was sitting in the waiting room trying not to vomit, a random woman was repeatedly playing the opening part of the Sister Sister theme song. Sister Siiiiiiisterrrr. It was stuck in my head for weeks."
Moesha,"Girlfriends will be the first thing I watch

Moesha,"I thought the good ones were Different Strokes, Family Matters, the Hughleys, Living Single and Martin."
Moesha,"Who the hell wants to rewatch Sister Sister, I'm so close to canceling Netflix."
Moesha,Ahhh yes the shows that came on the WB network after cartoons on weekday afternoons growing up. I usually changed over to Fox for Simpsons reruns.
Moesha,"Oh man, Moesha and Sister Sister was my childhood and I’m white as snow."
Moesha,"Sister Sister, Half & Half, One on One... god, they were so formulaic."
Moesha,"Are these really iconic to the black community though? Or are they simply being added for the color of their skin and not the content of their show? 

Seriously asking because I've never heard of any of these."
Moesha,Why is that I read the first couple titles and immediately thought the article was gonna be about the lead actress dying
Moesha,"Ah, when Monique was funny."
Supermarket Sweep,"I watched way too much of this show, and its vastly inferior companion Shop Til You Drop."
Supermarket Sweep,"""GO FOR THE DIAPERS!!"""
Supermarket Sweep,"My wife put on a couple of episodes for background noise last week, and I couldn't get over how the announcer has to give a random factoid after each commercial break, completely unrelated to the gameshow. Just seems so odd when these days we can look up any random bullshit that we want in about 2 seconds.

I just did some research and apparently it was a thing: https://supermarketsweep.fandom.com/wiki/Fun_Facts"
Supermarket Sweep,The host of the show had some great sweaters.
Supermarket Sweep,TIL Supermarket Sweep was originally American.
Supermarket Sweep,"Everyone is talking about this now.

I assume it hit Netflix."
Supermarket Sweep,"This would be a very different show if the grocery store was full of shoppers.  

#""GET THE FUCK OUTTA THE WAY, I'M GOING FOR THE HAM!!!"""
Supermarket Sweep,used to watch this and STYD with my Grandma.  Brings back memories of simpler times.
Supermarket Sweep,There's Becky bent over the deli counter!
Supermarket Sweep,"Supermarket Sweep was amazing. I remember being a child and going to the grocery store, telling my mother exactly what I would do to make sure I won. I would discuss strategies for maximizing my product to price ratio when hauling in the carts. And just the general panic and frenzy was amazing."
Supermarket Sweep,"I've been watching this show while I eat lunch lately. I can't help but think it would be perfect for a relaunch.

It's fun to watch, it would be fun to be on, and with all the product placements it should be essentially free to make, if not actually profitable to make."
Supermarket Sweep,I fucking loved this show growing up. So glad it's on netflix
Supermarket Sweep,It was the greatest show ever
Supermarket Sweep,I’ve been watching this on Netflix and it brings back great memories of being at my grandparents house in the early 90s.
Supermarket Sweep,"I love this show so much, and I thought they REMADE it and I got so excited...just to find they are just the old ones which is fine just still."
Supermarket Sweep,Who’s got the Doritos? Okay! Who’s got the Tide detergent? Okay! Who’s got the Sprite? OKAY!!!!
Supermarket Sweep,When is this show coming to ABC?
Supermarket Sweep,"I always wondered if they were real groceries and if you got to keep them, or if you just got the cash. The value they assigned the items were actually pretty competitive. I'd be happy with the stuff."
Supermarket Sweep,My mother was on the original version of Supermarket Sweep back in 1965. She didn't win.
Supermarket Sweep,"I loooooved this show even tho the formula got stale. Like, grab the damn meat, some oil, salamis, hammers (5 at a time or you a fool) and random medicine, and win! Oh and the inflatable product placement. Tho I remembered incorrectly that they would have cashiers scanning their items at the end ..."
Supermarket Sweep,"[Reboot with Leslie Jones](https://deadline.com/2020/01/abc-nabs-supermarket-sweep-revival-game-show-leslie-jones-host-1202824283/)


Absolute blast of a show.  I've sent in my audition.  Let's go"
Supermarket Sweep,"I used to love watching the British version when I was younger, but I tried watching some repeats recently and then some of the new episodes and couldn't get much enjoyment out of it.  It's a fun bit of silly TV though."
Supermarket Sweep,"The UK version is still great. Rylan Clark-Neal hosts the show now and he really makes it, highly recommend finding it if you ain’t seen it.

VPN your way onto ITV Hub and enjoy"
Supermarket Sweep,Get the hams !!
Supermarket Sweep,David Ruprecht actually is great as the former traveling host for the price is right. Much better than Drew Carey in my opinion.  That being said...supermarket sweep sadly doesn't hold up. Its so dull. The most exciting thing about the show is Ruprecht's sweater collection
Supermarket Sweep,I loved this show
Supermarket Sweep,Just got sucked into this show. Can confirm. Still don’t know why I didn’t watch this growing up. I would have loved it!
Supermarket Sweep,I actually miss this show.
Supermarket Sweep,"wow, american! that's so controversial!

odds this was posted by the netflix marketing team?"
Supermarket Sweep,"I was watching the 80s reruns because it’s so interesting to hear the contestants introduce themselves, and I love looking at their clothes, and people’s voices or accents were so much more attractive back then it fascinates me."
Supermarket Sweep,I get my laughs on that show from the dated wardrobe and hairdos alone.
Supermarket Sweep,"An unjustly cut SNL sketch.

She studied it, she's ready and she [has a plan.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-UggNH1YeRY)"
Supermarket Sweep,"When you're at the checkout and you hear the beep, think of the fun you could be having on supermarket sweep."
Supermarket Sweep,"I want James Franco and Seth Rogan to make this their next hit movie. Would be great to see Franco as the host and the usual Judd Apatow crew dressed as middle age house mom and that one guy on the show usually fucking shit up. 

You could show the main cast living their normal lives a week before they go to the show and have one team that really strategizes. The hose can do the lame little trivia or product placement commercial with zero fucks giving or something. Idk could make for a good movie"
Supermarket Sweep,"I still don't understand how people wouldn't immediately head for the pharmacy part and start putting 5 of each medicine in their cart.  There's no way running around the entire store grabbing diapers, hams, and gallons of olive oil is more profitable than like 
300+ bottle of pills.  Like if you have 2 minutes to shop, spending a least a minute of it grabbing as many different kinds of medicines as possible than going for the big ticket bulkier items would have to net you an easy $1k or more."
Supermarket Sweep,Uh... isn’t it English? Dale Winton?
Supermarket Sweep,"I used to love this show as a kid. So I'm glad it's coming back.

>...as a revival of the series hosted by SNL’s Leslie Jones is meant to debut on ABC this fall.

Well nevermind. Guess I'm not watching."
Supermarket Sweep,[deleted]
Supermarket Sweep,This show is also on Amazon Prime and frequently on PlutoTV as well! David Ruprecht was so incredibly wholesome. His sweater game was on point.
Supermarket Sweep,"If you look carefully there's some product placement in every episode. I never caught it as a kid, I just assumed I kicked ass at this one show."
Supermarket Sweep,"my parents love this game show. it comes on, in reruns of coarse, on one of their tv channels and they watch it every weekday its on."
Supermarket Sweep,"I’d contend that Repo Games was the most American show of all time. From Google: “DescriptionThe premise of this game show, hosted by real-life repo men Josh Lewis and Tom DeTone, is simple: answer trivia questions correctly, and the ""contestants"" get to keep their car. If not, well, you can probably guess what happens. Lewis and DeTone show up at the homes of unsuspecting debtors with five trivia questions. If the hosts hear three correct answers, the car is paid off on the spot. If the debtors fail, the car is towed to the impound lot.”

So Americans in debt being financially coerced into playing a sad game on a reality tv show."
Supermarket Sweep,I used to confuse Guy's grocery games with this...until I watched it.
Supermarket Sweep,Tino Monte for us Canadians
Supermarket Sweep,I loved this show. Now all I have is guys grocery games. I’m sad
Supermarket Sweep,"be kinda interesting if they brought back this show.      I remember watching this and like... butterball turkies were the big ticket item people would max out on.    


the prices on some of that bullshit hipster/foodie horse shit is outrageous."
Supermarket Sweep,I’ve been watching the re-runs on Hulu and tbh I would love to see this show come back
Supermarket Sweep,"The video linked on the site has ""Todd"" drive his cart full bore into the host and his teammate.  It's like ""what the fuck, Todd?"""
Supermarket Sweep,[here's one place](https://www.backstage.com/casting/supermarket-sweep-342416/)
Supermarket Sweep,"Am I crazy, or if you aren’t looking does the host sound like Bill Hader doing an impression?"
Supermarket Sweep,"My mom and I used to watch this religiously when I was a kid. We had all these plans for how we’d win if we got on there. Then it went off the air and I was devastated.

Old episodes actually hit Prime awhile back and one snowy weekend, I was hanging out with my mom and we just started marathoning them and marveling at how fabulously ridiculous it was. She was still great at answering all the questions and even estimating what the prices would’ve been in the 90’s. I failed because a good portion of those brands or items definitely do not exist anymore."
Supermarket Sweep,"So many giant jugs of olive oil, turkeys and hams."
Supermarket Sweep,I would argue that Family Feud is the most hilariously American Game Show of all time. It's Americans guessing what other Americans think about things in a format where only the last round matters.
Supermarket Sweep,"I have been watching this on Netflix and it's hilarious.

The I productions are so cringy sometimes. The hairstyles are amazing. The commentary is hilarious.

In one episode 2 folks are being introduced and the the guy says, ""this is my sister"".

Later in the timed portion the commentator says, ""and there goes Megan's husband, Daryl!""

Such a loose, not giving a shit show lol."
Supermarket Sweep,"I was convinced when it showed up on Netflix that people would start asking if it was a Tim & Eric skit. 

I have only watched a couple, but it was as weird & wonderful as I remembered. I have yet to see if they have one of the episodes where the characters roamed the aisles. I remember one where Robocop was walking the aisle."
Supermarket Sweep,Who wants supermarketwave
Supermarket Sweep,[Fun fact: That set smelled pretty bad due to most of the items on the set being incredibly past their expiration date](https://twitter.com/greatbigstory/status/920411099060514816).
Supermarket Sweep,"everytime I see supermarket sweep, I think of the married with children episode where Al has the rigged cart"
Supermarket Sweep,"This show is even better now than it was 20 years ago, since it is based upon referencing, showing, and selling products that have either been discontinued or have changed their look over time. It's almost impossible to play along with some questions because the answer will be a product that hasn't existed for a decade or the clue will be a then-current pop culture reference. Then there are movie-based questions or items in the store that show you what was popular at the time, or categories like ""Hollywood Hunks"" that do the same. A really fun time capsule."
Supermarket Sweep,"I know, that when I'm in the checkout and I hear the beep, I think of all the fun I could have on Supermarket Sweep."
Supermarket Sweep,$7! That is so amazingly bad. That might be the worst strategy for the game ever.
Supermarket Sweep,I always thought it was a Canadian show
Supermarket Sweep,But it was originally British.
Supermarket Sweep,"I still don't really understand the rules.  I used to watch this all the time with my grandma.  My wife loves Food Network and Guy's Grocery Games, so we watched this casually on Netflix since she never heard of it.

But then she'd ask me ""Why are they getting turkeys?"" And I'm like, ""I don't know.  That's just what you do.  Grab 5 turkeys.  5 Hams and try to guess the mystery item.""  ""Why?""  ""I don't know."""
Supermarket Sweep,"Before I go on in my attempt to denounce this show, I must ask a question to the fans who know: What was done with the perishable/consumable food products after each show/season?"
Supermarket Sweep,[deleted]
Supermarket Sweep,My country is insane
Supermarket Sweep,"My dad’s best friend was on Shop Til You Drop when I was a kid and won his episode. I always loved that show as a kid but looking back, it was so boring compared to Supermarket Sweep. The only part I enjoyed was the final round, I couldn’t even tell you what the main gameplay was like. 

But man, watching these shows back to back every night as a kid is such a great memory. That was back before the renaissance of game shows so it was the best we had and I loved it"
Supermarket Sweep,"Was there a show on around the same time slot called Win, Lose or Draw? (and tic tac dough possibly with Wink Martingale). I could google it, or just rely on my childhood fever dream since I only watched game shows when I was home sick from school. 

oh and the no whammy one. Press Your Luck."
Supermarket Sweep,"You can still watch Supermarket Sweep on Pluto TV, on the Buzzr channel. It’s free too!"
Supermarket Sweep,"I agree, but I still watched both of them as a kid with my grandma. I always wanted to be on Supermarket Sweep, and I would plan on what items I would grab if I was on the show."
Supermarket Sweep,Used to love both of them. Sweep was definitely better though.
Supermarket Sweep,I liked Shop Til You Drop a lot more. It had two levels.
Supermarket Sweep,"Blasphemous, shop til you drop was great"
Supermarket Sweep,"Lol I always preferred shop til you drop a bit more, but I can see why others wouldnt."
Supermarket Sweep,"“Oh, looks like Linda is grinding up some coffee and THAT’S a high dollar item!”"
Supermarket Sweep,Gold wrapped hams or GTFO
Supermarket Sweep,Hair dye is where da real money is at.
Supermarket Sweep,Muscle up and go for those huge shanks of meat.
Supermarket Sweep,"Diapers, hams, and turkeys!"
Supermarket Sweep,You go for the meats!
Supermarket Sweep,Go for the cheese wheels!
Supermarket Sweep,The TURKEY'S!!!
Supermarket Sweep,"Yes! The facts aren't even related to food most of the time. It just comes back from commercial and he's like ""Did you know penguins have been shown in laboratory tests to prefer the color yellow? Anyway, time for the Big Sweep!"""
Supermarket Sweep,"And he says it as a hook to keep you watching, teasing it before the commercial break and finishing it after. I think that's so funny - like I would be like ""well, I *was* going to turn off the TV now, but I'll watch through the commercial break so I can find out about the Safeway in Des Moines, Iowa where they have the tallest grocery shelves in the world"""
Supermarket Sweep,"that article contradicts itself

it's a predecessor that replaces..."
Supermarket Sweep,">	the fact is usually seen right before the show takes its first commercial break.

huh, guess that explains why it takes so long to go to commercial on buzzr."
Supermarket Sweep,"He also played Thurston Howells son in a Gilligan's Island Movie.  I think it was the one with the Harlem Globetrotters.

Either that or it was all a Covid dream."
Supermarket Sweep,His sweaters were a dramatic element of every episode.
Supermarket Sweep,Wow. Same. Thought it was Dale's baby!
Supermarket Sweep,"Apparently so were Family Fortunes and Catchphrase. 

The US copied Mastermind and renamed it '2 Minute Drill' of all things, which does not roll off the tongue the same."
Supermarket Sweep,"We had a version in Australia in the 90s hosted by Aussie TV legend Ian ""Turps"" Turpie."
Supermarket Sweep,"That just shows you how much influence Netflix has. The show been airing on the Buzzr network and streaming on Amazon Prime for at least a couple years, but now that it's on Netflix you're getting articles like this."
Supermarket Sweep,"Yes indeed. Reminding us all of how batshit this show really was. Freaking ""market monsters"" prowling the aisles, spooking people. What in god's name did that have to do with a supermarket shopping show? What were they thinking?"
Supermarket Sweep,Whatever they put on the front page or say top 10 in us people will watch. Convenience programming
Supermarket Sweep,"Idk about everyone else but it is on Buzzr, the Pluto TV channel and I've been watching it for almost a year since cutting cords."
Supermarket Sweep,They still show re-runs on a station called Buzzer TV. It's one of those digital channels that's a sub of a real channel. It's channel 13.2 where I live. They show nothing but old game shows.
Supermarket Sweep,Fremantle put it on Netflix to get attention for the new version coming to ABC hosted by Leslie Jones coming fairly soon.
Supermarket Sweep,"Just come to any Publix in Boca Raton. If you want to play the same game on ""difficult"" mode, do it the week of an oncoming hurricane."
Supermarket Sweep,Don't forget the Rum.
Tada Never Falls In Love,The Good Place. The ending of that series was so perfect and fitting that It just made me feel like I had gotten everything I needed out of it.
Tada Never Falls In Love,The leftovers
Tada Never Falls In Love,"Six Feet Under - loved it, don't need to see it again."
Tada Never Falls In Love,Dead to Me starring Christina Applegate.  I loved it.  It was a great show with a good ending but watching her character go through the grief process was hard for me to watch.  And I consider that a compliment to her performance.  Loved the show.  Cried a lot.  Don't think I can watch it again.
Tada Never Falls In Love,Game of Thrones.
Tada Never Falls In Love,Lots of folks saying LOST and I would’ve agreed but I rewatched it recently with somebody who had never seen it and it brought all the fun right back
Tada Never Falls In Love,"I don't think I can pick up Bojack Horseman again.  


I watched it for a fair while and realised it was actually making me depressed.  
So I stopped watching it.  


Which is a shame because it's a really great series, just way too heavy for me."
Tada Never Falls In Love,"gintama is in the podium for my favorite shows ever, but it is way too long for me to do a rerun lol"
Tada Never Falls In Love,I loved HIMYM when it was on but the ending killed any rewatchability. Also the character Barney has aged terribly.
Tada Never Falls In Love,Dark - I really liked the show but it’s just too taxing and loses some of its appeal after you watch it once.
Tada Never Falls In Love,"Lucifer. I loved the show because of Tom Ellis' performance, but nothing else about the show was good. ""Lucifer"" was single handedly carried by his charisma, and the entertainment you get from watching him. But all the other characters were boring (not because of the actors, the writing was just bland for them) unless they were interacting with Lucifer. Also the procedural elements were always insanely predictable and not interesting and took up way too much time.

I can just look up the Tom Ellis as Lucifer highlights on youtube if I want to rewatch the good components of the show."
Tada Never Falls In Love,"Full Metal Alchemist. I was ok up to the episode ""Night of the Chimera's Cry"".   That episode was straight up brutal!"
Tada Never Falls In Love,"The OC. 

I got it out of my system after an influenza induced obsession in my min 20s and I have no intention of rewatching it."
Tada Never Falls In Love,"LOST

The best part of the show was speculating weekly with friends about what was happening"
Tada Never Falls In Love,"Neon Genesis Evangelion

Its really well produced and written, but I don't know if I'll want to go down trauma lane again any time soon. I don't even know if I can recommend it to people, it gets so dark. Then there's the End of Evangelion >!which was just a hour and a half of ""What if none of these traumatized characters got a happy ending?""!<"
Tada Never Falls In Love,"Most Drama Shows. 


The Handmaids Tale

Chernobyl

Homeland

Jessica Jones"
Tada Never Falls In Love,"I was \*literally\* just talking to my husband about Bojack. We have a hard time getting friends interested in this series for some reason, but it was probably one of the most well-done shows I've ever watched. When it hits, it hits."
Tada Never Falls In Love,Honestly Bojack for me too. Sometimes I want to restart it but it gets *heavy*. Hollyhock's storyline had me crying for hours even if I fully understand why it happened the way it did.
Tada Never Falls In Love,"There is no show I love that I wouldn't rewatch.

There are in the case of movies, but shows for me are generally very rewatchable. At least after some years passed."
Tada Never Falls In Love,"Six Feet Under
Great show, but was struggling to get through at times, and the show is very heavy and can be very emotionally exhausting.

Edit - I see people have already mentioned this one"
Tada Never Falls In Love,"Does a miniseries count?

Recently, my partner ordered a Blu-ray of ""The Day After"" and I REFUSE to watch it with him

That shit traumatized me when I was a little girl, though I was totally absorbed in it"
Tada Never Falls In Love,"Devilman Crybaby on Netflix. It starts slow, builds to a point then rips everything away from you in the most brutal and heartbreaking way and then leaves you an empty husk of a human in need of a hug."
Tada Never Falls In Love,The Good Place. Spolier alert: Everybody dies.
Tada Never Falls In Love,All of them. I don't like rewatching stuff
Tada Never Falls In Love,"Sharp Objects 

The main character goes through so much trauma man its pretty hard to watch."
Tada Never Falls In Love,"Lost, due to knowing how the mysteries introduced in the early seasons play out in the later ones."
Tada Never Falls In Love,"Dexter.

Such a shame too, because the first 4 seasons were superb - but after that point, it went slowly downhill to an abysmal finale. Even worse, it got renewed for a mini-series continuation, which was showing real promise - but then, the ending was once again a mess."
Tada Never Falls In Love,"You mean rewatch the entire series? MASH. All in the Family. The Odd Couple. X-Files. I can watch single episodes here and there, but not the whole series."
Tada Never Falls In Love,Legion.
Tada Never Falls In Love,Six Feet Under.
Tada Never Falls In Love,"It’s a kdrama - Mr Sunshine. It’s a masterpiece. 

It’s a slog till episode 17 then a binge till the end. 

I cried for days afterwards whenever I remembered it."
Tada Never Falls In Love,"I won't rewatch the whole Bojack series, but I would love to see the one where he's giving the eulogy for the whole episode now (Free Churro)."
Tada Never Falls In Love,"since the age of streaming, I cannot think of a tv series that I have ever rewatched."
Tada Never Falls In Love,dont think Ill ever have it in my to watch Oz again.
Tada Never Falls In Love,"Chernobyl 

Sharp Objects

Six Feet Under"
Tada Never Falls In Love,"Generally any show that has a serious storyline. Can only enjoy them once, rarely do I rewatch them.

Comedy on the other hand, I like rewatching them a lot."
Tada Never Falls In Love,"Mad Men, because I hated the last season and the ending.  Everything before that I absolutely adored, but those last few episodes ruined the series for me."
Tada Never Falls In Love,"The Newsroom, and Six Feet Under"
Tada Never Falls In Love,"Band of Brothers, my heart can only take so much."
Tada Never Falls In Love,"End of the Fxcking World

I loved it, but it kind of unnerved me a bit. I always felt uneasy after an episode."
Tada Never Falls In Love,It's A Sin (2021 British TV series by Russel T Davies about the AIDS epidemic in the 80s). I don't remember ever crying so much during anything else I've ever watched... Only 5 episodes but that was just about as much as I could handle. I call it the best show I've ever seen that I'm probably never going to watch again.
Tada Never Falls In Love,Twin Peaks
Tada Never Falls In Love,"I would never watch cartoons or TV shows that I watched as a very little kid. It's not that I hate them, it's just I have no desire to re-watch them and see any flaws. I remember stuff like 80's TMNT, The Super Mario Super Show, and Power Rangers being highlights of my post-school days, and I don't want to tarnish those memories in any way."
Tada Never Falls In Love,The Walking Dead.
Tada Never Falls In Love,"Never is a long time. Give it couple years, you will forget majority of the show and will eventually want to relive it.

I'm probably never rewatching something like X-files or Doctor Who in it's entirety - mostly episodic shows that have bajilion episodes and a lot of them is mediocre. I would rather return to specific episodes, last year I picked ~35 my favourite/best X-files episodes and only watched those."
Tada Never Falls In Love,"I'm sure I got a long list of them. Some shows are great, but don't warrant a rewatch. Breaking Bad is one that comes to mind for me. Or stuff like Lost that just have way too many episodes."
Tada Never Falls In Love,"LOST. I remember our daily crazy theories and heated discussions with colleagues at work back then. Also remember how disappointed everyone was with the ending. Now, watching it alone, without those fun speculations that kept everyone so interested in it, while also knowing the ending, just doesn't seem as appealing anymore.

I still consider it one of the top 10 TV series I've ever watched, but for me it's a one-time only."
Tada Never Falls In Love,Just about all of them. I really don't spend my time rewatching things.
Tada Never Falls In Love,"I can't say that I will not watch a show again, but it is harder to re-watch a show than a movie! It also depends on the show! A sitcom is very easy to watch over and over!"
Tada Never Falls In Love,"Game of thrones. I was so excited to rewatch, I remember watching through with my friends as it was coming out, we were all so psyched and ready to go through it again. After the awful ending, none of us had the drive to go through it all knowing how bad the ending was."
Tada Never Falls In Love,"Breaking Bad. I jumped in late, so I was able to binge at will. However - I had to take a break from it every so often. I tend to feel things a bit too much, and I FELT every character's struggles deeply. With that said, I'm so very glad I watched it - truly a triumphant show on so many levels."
Tada Never Falls In Love,Any show from back when 21-25 episodes per season was the norm.  Not enough time in the world.
Tada Never Falls In Love,"South Park. I used to be a huge fan and was there from the start. When I was younger I really thought they had some solid takes and a finger on the pulse of the world. I do feel they lost the plot and ended up being a great example of why The Simpsons refresh their writers from time to time, but even episodes I used to think of as favorites...that rapid six day schedule isn't great for long-term rewatching. Too many that felt like a good point in the moment aged poorly or were about something that was way more of a footnote than devoting a whole episode would suggest. Then some I'm just left scratching my head wondering what the hell they were on about when I remembered seeing the episode premiere."
Tada Never Falls In Love,"Probably sopranos. I loved everything about it (including the ending) but by the time it was over I hated every person in that show, to the point where I can't see myself rewatching it."
Tada Never Falls In Love,Breaking Bad
Tada Never Falls In Love,Lost.
Tada Never Falls In Love,Almost all of them (it’s hard for me to rewatch things)
Tada Never Falls In Love,"I've never rewatched a series. There is so much out there I haven't seen, why rewatch something I've already seen?"
Tada Never Falls In Love,Every show. Why would I rewatch something?
Tada Never Falls In Love,"Honestly, sort of in the spirit of the question, I don't think I'll watch any more seasons of The Last of Us if they do make more seasons.

At least not anything from the second game. Such a great series and an amazing season one! But I don't want the relationship that's been built up in the first season to, well, get 2nd game'ified.

Edit: thanks for the downvotes I guess, no idea why I’m getting them…"
Tada Never Falls In Love,Pretty much any series that I watched start to finish. Rewatching anything has never really appealed to me
Tada Never Falls In Love,"1. Breaking Bad....
2. Better Call Saul (currently watching)
Even though I love them, The pacing of these shows make rewatching them a massive chore

To be fair, I don't rewatch most TV shows except they have very high rewatch value like some foreshadowing, hints, etc

Only very few shows I've ever rewatched e.g Game of Thrones and a handful of anime like Attack on Titan, Death Note, Monster, Naruto

I plan to rewatch Mr Robot tho"
Tada Never Falls In Love,Buck Rogers.
Tada Never Falls In Love,Breaking Bad
Tada Never Falls In Love,I don’t know that I *love* it but Ozark. Just too dark to get back into it for 4 seasons at an hour a piece.
Tada Never Falls In Love,"Anything with hundreds of episodes. I love The Office and IASIP, and will happily watch the odd episode if it’s on TV late at night, but I’d never go back and watch it all in order again."
Tada Never Falls In Love,Kenan and kel obviously
Tada Never Falls In Love,"Twilight Zone.

Well, I still love it but I tend to skip certain episodes now."
Tada Never Falls In Love,"Honestly everything except The Office. That is the ONLY show I can actually rewatch. Doesn’t matter how good a show is, I just can’t any enjoyment out of rewatching tv shows"
Tada Never Falls In Love,Sharp Objects
Tada Never Falls In Love,"It's boring but... Basically every drama show that I've loved. It would be easier to say which of those I've actually rewatched. The Leftovers... I think that's it, actually. The Leftovers is the only drama I've seen that I've watched more than once.

Band of Brothers is probably the one drama I love that I don't want to rewatch the **most**. Anytime someone mentions the show, I think of that Bastogne episode and flinch."
Tada Never Falls In Love,"I’ve said the same thing about BoJack Horseman, absolutely amazing show… that I’ll probably *never* watch again."
Tada Never Falls In Love,Too many new shows can’t watch old stuff
Tada Never Falls In Love,"Sopranos, brilliant show but the last bit was a little slow to get through."
Tada Never Falls In Love,Right now?  The Last of Us.
Tada Never Falls In Love,"Hannibal.  Awesome show, great story arcs, acting, etc.  But I know the storyline, I'm ""good"" with not watching it all over again."
Tada Never Falls In Love,All of them. I have a hard enough time keeping up on new shows I want to watch; there's no way I'm going to go back and rewatch something.
Tada Never Falls In Love,Harlots  was soo good but cant do it again bc it just ends. Sad.
Tada Never Falls In Love,"Lost 
it all lives in my mind and I think about it daily"
Tada Never Falls In Love,All of them. No shows have managed to hit the same for me after a 2nd rewatch.
Tada Never Falls In Love,"On the flip side, I’ve rewatched Bojack maybe 4-5 times. It’s heavy but for the reasons you mentioned it has so much substance. Most scenes have some sort of visual gag in the background that I pick up on something different each time."
Tada Never Falls In Love,"All of them I guess. I never really rewatch tv shows, except for community maybe."
Tada Never Falls In Love,Breaking Bad. Its great but its also painful and full of plot twists that I already know about because they were so memorable
Tada Never Falls In Love,Lol bojack is one of the most rewatchable tv series.
Tada Never Falls In Love,Oz
Tada Never Falls In Love,Most of the shows I watch tbh. Shows I rewatch tend to be stuff I comfortably put on in the background for dinner and can enjoy at leisure. Like Futurama or B99.
Tada Never Falls In Love,"Six Feet Under, great show I loved it but I don’t think I could watch it again, it made me feel more depressed lol."
Tada Never Falls In Love,None. If I loved it I have or definitely will rewatch it.
Tada Never Falls In Love,"Sons of anarchy, anyone who tells you different is a liar"
Tada Never Falls In Love,I Agree on Bojack. That show wrecked me
Tada Never Falls In Love,"Reading the title I instantly thought of Bojack as well. I lost track of how many times I rewatched the earlier seasons.
The finale may have released at the beginning of 2020, but I didn't watch the final episodes until late last year. I just couldn't bring myself to do it.

And watching the end felt like a goodbye. It would feel like a betrayal to go back to the show now. Maybe I won't feel that way some years from now, but today I choose to leave it in the past."
Tada Never Falls In Love,"Done, return please"
Tada Never Falls In Love,"12 Monkeys, The Leftovers, and Penny Dreadful."
Tada Never Falls In Love,">For me, it’s BoJack Horseman. I just finished watching it for the first   
time and I don’t know if I have it in me to go through it again. Between  
 all the funny animal puns and sight gags, there was just too much   
self-destruction and heavy stuff going on. “That’s Too Much, Man!” and   
the subsequent reveal in season 6 regarding the ending was just a huge   
emotional gut punch that I don’t think I can ever revisit. Loved the   
series, thought it was phenomenal, but don’t think I can ever revisit it

Yes, the scene with Charlottes daugther is one of the biggest gut punches, and this is earlier in the series. I can't watch it again."
Tada Never Falls In Love,"Sons of Anarchy, great show with some slogs through it, it's just so brutal for the sake of brutality, we all knew how it would end starting from the very first episode they just drawed it way too long like an anime.

Shameless (us), I got many seasons into this show before I gave up, I got tired of the character reset they'd do countless self destruction because they wanted to reset characters, apparently the uk version solved for this by having characters actually get out of the spiral and leave the show which is what may of been the better option for this one too."
Tada Never Falls In Love,Is Shoah considered a series? I remember it being about 10 hours long billed as a single documentary but it always felt like a mini series without breaks to me. Essential viewing but utterly exhausting by the end. It's an epic time capsule of humanity at it's very worst.
Tada Never Falls In Love,"The Americans.   


Just a perfect series, but Elizabeth is so driven for the cause despite how its tearing her and her family apart. The immorality that's presented is just awful that even though its such a compelling series and great acting from everyone, I just can't find myself watching it again."
Tada Never Falls In Love,How I Met Your Mother
Tada Never Falls In Love,Veronica Mars.   Loved the show. The final season and series finally broke my whole soul.
Tada Never Falls In Love,Probably would be Bojack for me too. It's way too heavy for me. I might've rewatched the first season with my dad but he never got into the show. So I didn't continue. Did rewatch Free Churro a few times though.
The Governor,talking dead is so cool of a concept i wish they did it with all of my favorite shows
The Governor,To be honest I think I would be happy if they just copied the comics up to #100 without making any changes. If they pull it off it could be amazing.
The Governor,"“What we’ve done is open up the world so it’s less about our characters trying to find a safe corner in which to hide,” says show runner Glen Mazzara on the Georgia set. “I do think this year, the show feels more immediate and less theoretical. We’re not really dealing with questions of hope, what it takes to survive in this world. We’re doubling the threat, we have the zombies, we have the Governor.”"
The Governor,"Seems a bit spoilery for a title, no?"
The Governor,"Does anyone think the entire Governor arc is going to play out in this upcoming season? Or do you think it will stretch out over more than one season?

It's been a little while since I've read the comic books, but I remember there was a *lot* of story between the moment Michonne joins the survivors to the end of the Governor plotline. Not sure if 16 episodes is enough for all of that, particularly given how slow-paced the show can be at times."
The Governor,Guess they decided to change the Governor to a white guy. How surprising. 
The Governor,"There is Thronecast(Game of Thrones) on Sky, which is pretty similar in concept."
The Governor,"Agreed.  Chris Hardwick is also an amazing host, you can tell he actually loves this show and isn't just there to be a host."
The Governor,I haven't ever watched it. Is it like Doctor Who Confidential (documentary-style making of) or is it more like a talk show? 
The Governor,"Agreed. They actually stay there long enough to have a full season of material, unlike the farm. "
The Governor,I hate every bit of what they've integrated from the comics. That's why there's two different mediums. Keep them separate. Black chick with zombie pets? STUPID.
The Governor,Except it's pretty much the plot of every zombie movie ever.  
The Governor,Chris does a great joob. And I've listened to Hardwick's podcast for quite a while and recommend it to anyone who hasn't checked it out yet... www.nerdist.com
The Governor,"More than I season I should think. They're at the farm for about 4 issues, and at the prison for 36. They could probably do two seasons with it."
The Governor,I feel as though the prison and governor story arc would transfer well into film though.
The Governor,The entire show is a comic book. The things that are terrible in the show are the things they changed from the comic book.
The Governor,"Yeah, true enough.  ;)"
The Governor,Black chick with zombie pets = retarded.
The Governor,Entire episodes of melodrama = STUPID
The Governor,"You're right, but at least I can take that seriously (for what it's worth in a zombie show). A hooded black chick with dreads and zombie pets on chains....I'm sorry, I can't even watch this show anymore."
The Governor,If you actually had taste.. you would have stopped watching the show after episode three.
The Governor,Sadly you're right. 
The Governor,"This was really interesting, and also what a creative way for the teacher to get the students interested in reading/writing... having them look at television scripts for shows they liked."
The Governor,I don't like mixing politics and narrative pushing with my silly sitcoms. kthnxbye. 
The Governor,"I don't see that episode being about politics, it was a way for the show to touch on social exceptance in a time where there were still very limited images of African Americans on TV."
The Governor,[deleted]
The Governor,"Or maybe he just doesn't like mixing politics (especially race relations) with his sitcoms like he said. 

Can't you take someone for their word, or are you actually that ignorant to other people's opinions? "
The Governor,"Maybe just fuck off, peckerwood."
The Governor,"Well, that answers my question alright. "
The Governor,Who cares if it's not the same as the comics. What's so exciting watching something you already know the ending to?
The Governor,"Interesting. Keeping with the TV show tradition he looks nothing like the comic version. I find that strange though, seems like they could at least give him the long hair or the mustache. Although I did find it weird that people would follow such a skeevy looking guy. "
The Governor,How is that The Governor? I never criticize differences between originals and adaptations but...that's awful.
The Governor,Was Danny Trejo busy?
The Governor,You watched nine seasons of a show you hated? Why?
The Governor,"Being in the same genre =/= being of the same quality. 

The Last of Us is a great show so far, full stop. Wonderfully written/acted/paced/etc. Regardless of genre, it is just an incredibly high quality show. 

Will they fall prey to the same traps TWD did in latter seasons? Who knows? Who cares at this point?"
The Governor,"The problem with the Walking Dead wasn't really the plot itself. The problem was that it was stretched to 16 episodes per season with 8 episodes of plot because the network is greedy and strung it out for money. The problem was that the writing was painful with an acting core which really wasn't that good after they killed the best off in the first couple seasons. The problem was they were began trying to write dialogue and interweaving storylines like game of thrones in later seasons and failed miserably. 

TLOU will tell a complete story in one season. It's in the setting up stage. Still, the acting is much better and, when you know how this story ends, the smaller moments will mean a lot more to you on rewatch. If you don't like the payoff as the end of the season, feel free to have this take. As of now, you have to trust that the ride will be worth it."
The Governor,"The best way I can put it is ""focus"".

With most of the later Walking Dead episodes, the focus was a little scattered. You'd get a conversation here, a conversation there, a little action, but it felt a bit all over the place without any cohesion in the narrative or themes. It was a bit like a soap opera. The best episodes were the ones that would focus on something in particular. For example, there was a whole episode devoted to Eastman teaching Morgan how to fight with the bo staff. Those were the most engaging episodes.

That's what The Last of Us is doing right. It's focusing episodes around specific things that build up to something and not just scatter shot something resembling a narrative."
The Governor,"Spoiler, Joel doesn't get flown away in a helicopter.

I'm calling it now."
The Governor,"The entire story of TLoU is out, just look it up and decide for yourself?

This is nothing like the Walking Dead. The Last of Us isn't going past 3 seasons."
The Governor,"In The Walking Dead there never seemed to be a real overarching goal other than to survive and find and keep sanctuary. The main group would accomplish this until a new antagonist was introduced and the group had to fight them off or go somewhere else and start over.  


We are only a few episodes into The Last of Us but its already apparent what the goal is: Deliver Ellie to the Fireflies so they can hopefully research her immunity to find a cure. People that played the game will know what happens but at least an end goal is apparent and attainable. At this point its impossible for the show to go 9 seasons. It will not end up like the Walking Dead.  


I do think that there were characters introduced that gave me TWd vibes. Kathleen for example. Hopefully next episode will add some more context."
The Governor,">I'm sure some HBO sponsored algorithm will delete this post

You need to go outside and breath in some fresh air."
The Governor,"Episode 4 is not a victim of this because Ellie/Joel character development is the story, and it unfolds beautifully with each episode.

And I won’t be the same because it’s:
a) a great existing story adapted beautifully 
b) showrunner is one of the best working on TV currently 

I wouldn’t worry if I were you"
The Governor,Well for starters HBO has decent writers and directors and they aren't going to make 20 episodes per season where basically nothing happens for 90% of the time. It will be 2 or max 3 seasons and they'll wrap it up.
The Governor,"""hate watched the last nine seasons""

Who has the time to watch a show you don't like? I don't get it, but you do you."
The Governor,"At some point people should probably learn the zombie genre is about character interaction primarily and almost exclusively. 

Apparently 11 years of twd wasn't enough. Maybe a few years of the last of us will be"
The Governor,"I read the Walking Dead comic and played Part 1 of the Last of Us. 

These two shows are similar in their early seasons. Let's be real, we only got 4 episodes of The Last of Us. Most of those episodes had very little zombies. Which is fine, that's the point of these shows, to explore the human condition in a zombie plague. 

I loved the Walking Dead until they started being cowards. They wouldn't kill the big characters, they were afraid of losing viewers. That was the downfall IMO. Darryl needs to take the bat. That would make people watch, why? But everyone loves Darryl? Yeah but you have 3 seasons of Negan being alive and well. The crew could be after him for revenge. Anyways, that's not the point. 

The Last of Us has the same thing going for it, but now the creators have said they would stick to the game...ok we will see. But the few episodes we have seen, yeah this is going to be good if they keep it up. Milk it? 

Tell us the story of Joel in a spin-off. The 20 years that's missing. I'm watching every night."
The Governor,"I agree, comparison with TWD is inevitable. I asked myself the other day, is it really different? I see similar situations plot wise. TWD used to be huge, now The Last of Us is huge."
The Governor,Yes they are very different
The Governor,Yes walking dead was stretched out garbage
The Governor,"The Last of Us has a much bigger budget, and so won’t be forced to keep characters in one place for entire seasons at a time due to not having the money to build multiple big sets.  

Also, they won’t drag this show out longer than they need to.  The first game is the first season.  The second game looks set to be seasons two and three.  By that time, the third game will probably be out and they can go from there.  Unlike most networks, HBO historically has not pressured their creators to extend shows past their creative vision."
The Governor,"Here's why your concerns are unwarranted

(1) The show is only going to run for three seasons. Hence it won't become stale and repetitive.

(2) The main cast is small. Literally two people. That may change in the future but I doubt it will blow up and become bloated like TWD. Joel and Elle should be in every episode and not disappear an come off as guest stars of the their own show."
The Governor,This post reminds me of the r/overwatch subreddit where they pour hundreds of hours into a game they don’t enjoy and come on Reddit to let people know as if they give a shit lol
The Governor,"
But what do we have in the Last of Us?  Episode 2, they got slightly further. Episode 3, excellent character story but at the end the only development was the acquisition of some more guns (Walking Dead haters would have downvoted the episode into oblivion).  

Just to prove you wrong I hate the walking dead and I loved episode 3.

But genuinely, you seem to have missed the entire point of The Last of Us. 

The show isn’t *about* the apocalypse. It’s about the people in it, and how they find each other and form strong bonds and connections in a world that tries its best to destroy every last ounce of hope. Joel even states multiple times throughout the first four episodes that he doesn’t really fear or care about the “zombies”. It’s the people he fear. Hopeless people who will do anything they can to survive one more day. 

> Episode 4, we got a little further.     

You watched four episodes of the show, where the main plot point is “get Ellie from point A to point B and you complain that they’re….. getting further to point B?

> I'm just curious, me and the rest of the world hated the last 9 seasons of the Walking Dead because of the overabundance of character development and the lack of plot development.  

I hated it because it had little to no character development, relied on self grandiose characters and little to no plot, shocking scenes for the sake of shock and a near mindless attitude towards where the plot was going. 

> Four episodes in and The Last of Us has already become a victim of this.    

You aren’t watching the last of us if you think this. 

> How many episodes until Joel gets flown away in a helicopter and we never hear from him again?     

If you don’t like it, don’t watch it. I genuinely do not understand why you would bother watching a show that’s clearly neither meant for you, nor one that you’re able to “get”. Which is fine, but you don’t need to make a point out of it. Just stop watching."
The Governor,"I think the difference is hope.  What do the characters in Walking Dead hope for? Just another day? 

In Last of Us, there is hope in a cure. And I think that’s what keeps them going in a different kind of way"
The Governor,"Conceptually, they aren't that different.  I don't agree with the people making strained arguments for how they're totally different.

They're primarily about genuine character relationships/interactions under the stress and tension of a post-apocalyptic world.

It's the execution that is potentially quite different.

At least in my case, I just grew tired of TWD and stopped really caring.  After a while, it just felt like ""why am I watching this?""  ""What's the point?""  As for how I got there, I would say the show led me to that point with its writing.

At least so far with The Last of Us, I still care.  In shows like TWD and The Last of Us, it's pretty important that you care about the characters.  It's the difference between character driven stories and plot driven stories.  You need good characters to be a character driven story.  What I think The Last of Us has done well so far is establish characters quickly with enough development while making them likable.  It's okay if the episodes are development heavy if you actually care about the characters just as much as their journey / the plot."
The Governor,"TWD and Last of us are very very different stories. That they both have 'zombies' is almost inconsequential. I want to avoid saying more due to spoilers, but I'll say the TWD is a zombie story, even the comics. The Last of Us is not a zombie story, zombies just exist in the story."
The Governor,"I agree 100% about Walking Dead:  It stopped being scifi or even horror and became just an endless survivalist slog.  I have not been interested in \_The Last of Us\_ because I am so turned off by the whole genre now, but I've heard such good things about it that I have been on the fence about trying it..."
The Governor,"As someone who’s played the games, keep watching."
The Governor,"Yes, unlike The Walking Dead, The Last of US is great."
The Governor,">I'm just curious, me and the rest of the world hated the last 9 seasons of the Walking Dead 

Rest of the world did not hate the last 9 seasons lol

>because of the overabundance of character development and the lack of plot development.  Four episodes in and The Last of Us has already become a victim of this.

I get the feeling you don’t understand the point of these shows. It would be best to stay away from them."
The Governor,TWD was never a good show. Boring characters and absolutely terrible writing.
The Governor,TWD has more interesting characters.
The Governor,The walking dead in later seasons had a young black woman who somehow kept a perfectly managed fade in the middle of the fucking wilderness and apocalypse. the attention to detail makes a world of difference.
The Governor,"The difference is The Walking Dead is a soap opera, that's what Kirkman set out to create, it's about communitys and the injection of drama into them, TLOU is a character study, it has communities but they aren't the focus, rather the journey of a few characters is.

Now I love TWD comic but it's very true that it got into a routine of find a community, destroy it move to the next, with each arc it becomes a look into these communities how they form and what it takes to tear them down, TLOU is different in that each game is the arc, there's a journey across the country but its not about establishing and destroying communities, it's about fostering a bond and then raising a question, exactly how much does that bond mean?

I think the set dressing is going to feel similar, because it's post apocalyptic zombie adjacent, if you spend all your time trying to create something unique in that space that makes sense there won't be time to focus on the elements that make it good, so yes there's different communities around the world but how the narrative interacts with is different because its not the soap opera that TWD set out to be."
The Governor,"What a shit title and take.

>Vince Gilligan could've solved these issues in two episodes.

As a Breaking Bad fan, I cringed when you mentioned Vince.

>me and the rest of the world hated the last 9 seasons of the Walking Dead because of the overabundance of character development and the lack of plot development.

And you think it got 9 seasons beyond your taste because people hated it? I loved TWD, though I hate almost everything post-Rick, and he was there until Season 9. I did not hate the character development at all... I still don't understand why you feel so entitled to claim the world shares your opinion? It seems to me you're just a Left 4 Dead fan who wanted a Left 4 Dead show...

>Episode 3, excellent character story but at the end the only development was the acquisition of some more guns

Tell me this is satire...

>How many episodes until Joel gets flown away in a helicopter and we never hear from him again?

This is satire, isn't it? This happens in the next episode. Ellie then goes around girl bossing people left and right until she meets a Brother in Christ that straightens her up. /s"
The Governor,"You are not wrong. The Last of Us is a good show, as TWD has been for several seasons. And there's nothing extraordinary about TLoU, other than an efficient marketing machine. Again, it's a good show, nothing new or surprising. It's not a demerit, actually. Perhaps this sub has been watching little TV for the last 2 years and being surprised by anything."
The Governor,"Can’t say I understand hate watching at all, but personally I don’t like the walking dead and am loving the last of us."
The Governor,"I can't hate watch nine episodes, let alone nine seasons. Hot damn"
The Governor,I love comics (Invincible and Saga are 2 of my favs) but the last of us game is so much more popular are reached so many more people.  Had HBO picked up TWD and cut all the fat that AMC/Gimple bloated TWD with I believe it would have been a completely different show.  It’s almost as if two great stories can vary wildly in quality when brought to screen by different producers.
The Governor,"I've hardly seen any zombies/mushroom people. So yes, it's different."
The Governor,yeah
The Governor,"Why did you ""hate watch"" *nine seasons* of a TV show? I don't think you hate it at that point."
The Governor,"The Walking Dead would have benefited from a 8-10 episode person season format. Regardless of what people say, imo, was good up until the end of season 6 when they ended it with Negan killing someone and us not knowing. The Whisperers made it interesting again too. So they could've cut a lot of filler episodes and the show would still be considered one of the better shows of the last decade. Also, HBO just cranks out great content. The Walking Dead almost was going to be on HBO too. But we may not have gotten GoT."
The Governor,It’s similar to well-written episodes of TWD from the early seasons before it became silly and even more over the top
The Governor,"Gave up on Walking Dead at around season 6/7. 

My wife pushed on through to the end and now wants me to start on TLoU, and I gotta say I am just not interested in the LEAST.

I didn't play the game either, even though I'm a video game guy. I am just sick to death of the genre."
The Governor,"I’ve just been reflecting on this. If walking dead was about the main and his son just traveling around, there would be no difference at all. Actually one of the major failings of TWD was the large ensemble to track. Structurally and content wise they’re the same"
The Governor,I watched season 1 of WD and thought it was boring and uninteresting. None of the characters were developed. And the zombies were generic. The characters make or break story for me and I never connected with them. Last of Us is the characters. They are the most important aspects to the story.
The Governor,"The game is, the tv show? Not so much. More gayness, but otherwise yeah it’s a case of wash rinse repeat."
The Governor,TLOU has 3 seasons worth of story. So it wont overstay his welcome like TWD.
The Governor,"Well there’s only two games, without getting into spoilers - both have very definitive endings and make big, bold narrative choices. Mazin has said Season 1 is Game 1 and Season 2 will adapt Game 2. He also has said that he hates filler, and based on the first four episodes that seems to be true. I guess what I’m saying is this show is going to make big points and do them faster than most shows. I’d be surprised if the show goes longer than 3 seasons. At the most, it’ll be 5 if they end up releasing a Last of Us: Part III"
The Governor,"I wound up watching TWD to find out (1) what caused the zombies; and (2) whether it could be cured.  Late on, this turned into watching begrudgingly, when I realized it was never going to happen. 

I got that from the 1st episode in TLOU."
The Governor,"Because we know exactly where it’s going. The pacing feels right when you have a general sense of how much is supposed to happen, which is something TWD could’ve never had with its audience. 

There’s a huge amount of people who are watching this knowing what to expect - and wanting them to slow down to take time to maybe expand a bit more.

I can also understand the audience who haven’t played the games getting frustrated at the slower pacing, but I hope you get to see how this really builds out the world and develops the characters more than we’d typically see in this genre. Ultimately what made the game so successful in 2013 was it succeeded *despite* the genre. In a time where we had new “zombie” content everywhere the characters and storytelling really set this apart to win over people who otherwise wouldn’t have given it a second look.

Coming from a very recent game also gives the producers a huge advantage. We already know the plot, setting, characters, concept art, how things should look, how the characters should sound and behave. Hell, we even have most of the staging blocked out like it was already a movie. While it could be seen as limiting, to me this has given them so much relief to essentially turn in a “newer draft” of the script they’d already written. We get things expanded that needed clarification, adapted to slow or speed up the pace where necessary, etc. I think that’s just such a unique position to be in because other adapted works are working with much, much less material and have to spend so much more time creating the world."
The Governor,1 episode showing a high-quality character arc beats mediocre character arcs milked to death for 20 episodes a season.
The Governor,Episode 4 showed a lot. TLOU isn't about zombies. It's about Joel and Ellie. You are looking at the show wrong.
The Governor,"Patience, young padawan"
The Governor,"No one will have a conversation about the last of us 2 plot. I’ve tried. People either hate it, or love it to death. I do not like the story. If you’ve seen walking dead seasons 6-8. The last of us season 2 will be very familiar lol"
The Governor,"They are very similar, and even the conceit of the plot of TLOU is not very original: ""Get immune person to someone who can science a cure,"" but I think the devil is in the details, it's crafted with extreme care and very high quality."
The Governor,It’s very intricately different… lol
The Governor,"Honestly, yes. They are different shows, and that’ll become more clear as it goes along."
The Governor,"The rabid fans won't admit it, but this show will fall into the TWD pattern as episodes go on. The stories aren't carbon copy, but TWD had a great start as well. 

The fans will tell you TLoU isn't about the walkers or clickers, but what was TWD after a couple of seasons. TWD was about human condition and savagery. Guess what will happen in TLoU."
The Governor,"Um, zombies currently aren’t the focus? Walking Dead had just an endless supply and they were all over just about every episode."
The Governor,Feels exactly the same. Will stop after the first season like walking dead.
The Governor,To build himself up to hate another show and tell us all about it
The Governor,"The show did a pretty good job at having 1-2 good episodes per season that would keep you coming back with a small amount of hope they might turn it around.  Usually the season premiere and finale were worthy, rest was trash."
The Governor,"Yeah, that shit always puzzles me.

I also got to the point where I wasn't enjoying the walking dead anymore, but I watched like 3 or 4 episodes pass that point. I sure as hell didn't keep watching the entire thing. Why when there is so much else I can be doing?"
The Governor,This man is fueled on pure spite.
The Governor,"""Maybe they'll actually start trying to kill off some of the zombies instead of letting them horde up at the prison fence - they are just there, piling up - you know that fence won't last forever""  


Nope. They just let them pile up. Didn't do some basic maintenance because ""They'll just keep coming"" - yeah with that fukin attitude.  


Stopped watching that season. They had day after day in that prison, and what did they spend their time doing?

&#x200B;

I'm mad I even gave it 4 seasons."
The Governor,"I wonder if they really did hate-watch it, or they want hide the fact that they watched it so as to not go against consensus."
The Governor,Especially considering seasons 1-6 and 9-11 of Walking Dead are considered good to phenomenal tv. Maybe a sign one doesn’t like the genre if they hate watched the strong seasons
The Governor,"Honestly, I liked the first few seasons enough that I thought it might get back on track at some point. By maybe season 8 it was more of 'well, I've come this far...' There were a few good episodes mixed in and the acting was always solid but they needed to take more chances in the writing room.  I had hope.  It didn't pay off."
Word Party Songs,"I'd like to reiterate, fuck Caillou."
Word Party Songs,here's a [good read on Total Drama Island](https://www.reddit.com/r/HobbyDrama/comments/uptttz/animation_the_tragedy_of_total_drama_reunion_how/) from the r/HobbyDrama subreddit
Word Party Songs,This was a great read.
Word Party Songs,"I was there for the silver age. 

I really liked Delilah and Julius. 

And one I didn't see mentioned later on was Detentionaire. Came in 2011-2015 and was pretty good."
Word Party Songs,"That was quite the word vomit, and I remember Teletoon fondly as a kid watching it on weekends during sleepovers at friends places. How are you going to write all that and not mention some greats like:

-	Roughnecks (Animated Starship Troopers)
-	The Oblongs
-	Undergrads
-	Mission Hill
-	The Critic
-	Tripping the Rift

And some weirder ones like Home Movies, Quads!, and god knows what else I can’t quite remember. I do recall Cybersix being a little over my head as a kid though and thought the main character was actually a dude for awhile lol.

Edit - I also rewatched the entirety of Roughnecks recently and it actually holds up pretty damn well. The voice acting is done well, and even though the CGI is from that era, it was really well done. I had never seen it all the way through when I was younger due to missing episodes and their infamously bad release schedule, but it was well worth the time to watch. The last season got cut short and it could have ended more cleanly, but I still enjoyed it thoroughly even after all these years."
Word Party Songs,"I remember watching Undergrads and Clone high on Teletoon, you mentioned so many shows I totally forgot about....What a loss, but it was time."
Word Party Songs,Teletoon was such a big part of my childhood. I used to watch scooby doo every day after school.
Word Party Songs,Neds newt was the shit. You missed Dragon Ball
Word Party Songs,"Omg I forgot about Megababies. The theme song immediately started playing in my head. I LOVED Braceface and For Better Or For Worse! Ugh I grew up on Teletoon, from the mid/late nineties till about 2004. This post was so nostalgic."
Word Party Songs,"This post was a huge nostalgia trip for myself. Just thinking back there are so many shows that I enjoyed that actually were Teletoon originals and I just didn't realize it - it's kind of amazing! Teletoon circa 2005 through 2009 was my favourite period, mostly because of all the cool action-adventure shows that premiered in that time. I loved watching Chaotic, Bakugan, Spider Riders, Atomic Betty, and Skyland. I did also enjoy 6teen, the first season of Total Drama Island, and Johnny Test, but I never watched them consistently. From their earlier blocks, I will always have a soft spot for The Tofus, What About Mimi, What's with Andy (though admittedly I mostly watched the Romanian dub for this), Rescue Heroes, Maggie and the Ferocious Beast, The Kids from Room 402 (mostly the Romanian dub again)...and the theme song from Flying Rhino Junior High will still occasionally get stuck in my head :P 

I just hope that all these shows will be made more accessible for more folks to enjoy in future and not get put into an inconspicuous vault/removed from streaming without warning."
Word Party Songs,I just bought the entire Redwall book series. 20+ books. Hoping it gets another shot at the screen because it's prime for adaptation imo
Word Party Songs,"I grew up in Quebec and teletoon was my childhood. I remember it had the best animated series out there even before series that had continuity(not episodic) was a thing. Redwall, silvering and toad patrol were amazing."
Word Party Songs,"My parents didnt want to get more than the basic tv package, we didnt have the Teletoon channels, much to my chagrin.

Channel 44 for us, I think that was the french version.

We had to make do with VrakTv (25) and YTV (70?)."
Word Party Songs,Anyone remember Untalkative Bunny? That's the first thing that comes to mind when I think of Teletoon
Word Party Songs,"Man I thought I was the only one who remembered Mega Babies.

Also shout out to weeknights from 8-9pm when The Bugs Bunny and Tweety Show was on."
Word Party Songs,Delta state was the shit!
Word Party Songs,"Don't forget Clone High! The late night era with Undergrads, Oblongs, Mission hill and Clone High was the best."
Word Party Songs,Dragon Ball was on YTV
Word Party Songs,I knew I was forgetting one. Clone High was amazing.
Word Party Songs,It was on both actually
Word Party Songs,I seem to remember Sons of Butcher playing in that era with those shows but that might’ve been YTV
Word Party Songs,"Ah, I see now. They aired 13 episodes in 1997. So yeah you're *technically* correct, but I think most Canadian kids who grew up in that era would remember it as a YTV show."
Word Party Songs,Saw that too and I swear they had more than 14 episodes. It was a long time ago so who knows
Word Party Songs,"For me it felt too modern, in dialogue and approach to themes. You cannot have willow going ""you are x, the y, the z, born ecc.."" and then having another character saying ""like"" every two sentences. The story wasn't that good, and the actors ranged from ok to barely tolerable. 

It's a problem I'm seeing even in non-US production . It yanks me off the show."
Word Party Songs,"Davis needed more disciplined direction. He didn't vibe with the cast but would have a stretch here and there where he was on point.

I think the rest of the cast did their best and I actually started to like all of them, but they were done dirty by the weird uneven tone. 

They need to respect younger viewers more like the movie did and quit pandering to what they must think is the YouTube demo.

Davis daughter gave a really good performance and it seemed like her and the guard captain in the earlier episodes understood what the show should be. I thought she'd be on the quest because she had a presence they needed but she was underused. 

The Gales started out awesome and we're designed really well but they lost their mystique and energy part way through."
Word Party Songs,"To me it felt like a cheesy D&D campaign, which I was okay with. Was it the best, no. Was is trash, no. Straight B movie vibes, like you know, Willow was. The only thing I really disliked about it was the music seemed in no way to match the show, like at all."
Word Party Songs,"I gave up after 3 episodes.  The cringey modern teen dialog felt completely out of place, like you mentioned.  Costumes and sets were about what I was expecting, so no real complaints there from me.  The writing (plot and dialog) are what caused me to quit."
Word Party Songs,I realize this is probably the opposite of what you're going for but everything you're describing sounds so entertaining I think I'm going to check it out now
Word Party Songs,"I agree with most of your criticisms. 

Weirdly, I’m more excited for the upcoming Dungeons and Dragons movie which appears to have all of the issues that the Willow series has but it looks more fun."
Word Party Songs,"Willow isn't the protaganist in a show named after him.

Instead you get two girls who seem to be from Earth in the year 2023 who have been transported to another time. I mean, it could not have been anymore jarring if they left their airpods in while doing scenes.

Just some acting, would have been nice."
Word Party Songs,"I really liked it.  And there's nothing wrong with the costumes, action or dialog."
Word Party Songs,I didn't make it pass the 15 min marker with all the immediate teen drama. You are a champ for pushing thru the entire season.
Word Party Songs,Why is this post so bad?
Word Party Songs,I liked it
Word Party Songs,I loved that it didn’t take itself too seriously. Sometimes that’s just what I want out of a show. I thought it was great 🤷‍♀️
Word Party Songs,"I told my friends that asked if it was worth finishing and told them it gets slightly better, but not enough to justify itself. 

Also, what was with the darkness?  So many episodes take place in near total darkness.  Light the damn scenes, we know it is in a cave and the characters can barely see, but the audience still needs to see!"
Word Party Songs,Disney trying to be woke and hip. Disney is the king of this kind of content so they seem less evil than they actually are
Word Party Songs,"  I don't know, I have not seen an episode because the target audience is 10 and below?  Isn't it a show for kids?"
Word Party Songs,"If I could distill your post, Willow sucks in the same way Velma sucks. Neither one wants to be anything like the original, but could have worked as their own thing — but since they're not their own thing, they kinda suck."
Word Party Songs,">The original film wasn't a camp film -- it was a grimdark action adventure with light comedy. 

News to me."
Word Party Songs,I'm not gonna read all that.
Word Party Songs,"I really liked it. The show is clearly an action comedy. Just watch the Making Of.

They knew exactly what kind of show they were making, and Game Of Thrones was not it.

Much like the original, the point of this show was to see something new, and to see people that are heroes that you wouldn't normally see on TV."
Word Party Songs,Because your expectations were too high.
Word Party Songs,"I did like his daughter and the girl who played Jade. I feel like some of the actors were talented, but they didn't have anything good to work with."
Word Party Songs,"I don't really think that George Lucas and Ron Howard would be considered ""b"" filmmakers by the time Willow was produced.  It wasn't a New World Pictures release, it was MGM/Lucasfilm/Imagine produced.  I chose New World because that is where Howard did get started making movies."
Word Party Songs,"I'm not going for anything. I'm just giving my feedback on the show. I wanted to love the show because the film is a part of my childhood. It released when I was in second grade and I watched it repeatedly as a child through my adulthood. It was my comfort film, growing up. Right up there with Labyrinth, Neverending Story, and Legend. 

Based on the trailer, I thought I was getting a continuation of the film. It veered off into a different direction and it wasn't executed very well. 

If other people enjoy the show, who am I to tell them what they can and can't enjoy? I didn't like it and I was very sad about that."
Word Party Songs,"It's dumb, but a fun kind of dumb.  Like an old Roger Corman flick."
Word Party Songs,I found it very entertaining. I think most people have forgotten how campy the movie was.
Word Party Songs,"See, I can get behind that with D&D  because D&D can be what you want to make of it. Vox Machina (dnd/Critical Role based series on Amazon) has a lot of anachronisms and such, much like any given D&D sessions that friends sit down to play. It's inevitable. Plus you can set actual D&D campaigns in the modern, contemporary world. A few cRPG's based on D&D actually do this... like the Shadowrun series. 

With Willow, it doesn't work because the original 1988 film is not anachronistic, plus it was well written, doing a clever job at weaving light comedy elements into its dark world without breaking viewers' immersion."
Word Party Songs,Removing the male lead and replacing him with women? How groundbreaking. It's time for studios to start actually writing good female characters.
Word Party Songs,"Overall I enjoyed it, but I will say the costumes were often strikingly and distractingly modern.  One of the brownies wearing a jumpsuit and Elora's jacket having a zipper were two things that I had a chuckle over."
Word Party Songs,"Me too! couldn't finish the first episode. I wanted to, dammit. I really wanted to."
Word Party Songs,Why is this post so *long*?
Word Party Songs,"What are you, 12?"
Word Party Songs,"I mean and that's fine. I am not gonna be like, ""How dare you enjoy a show that I hated?! Hrmph."" I totally get it.

Honestly, I couldn't tell if the tv series was taking itself seriously or not. It didn't go full on camp, and it definitely wasn't the same tone as the film. The film took itself seriously, but there was cleverly written comedy added to it, too. 1988 Willow reminded me of Indiana Jones. Both had the same tone, plus the clever blending of action, drama, tension, and light comedy. I would maybe even say the same for Ghostbusters, but it had heavier comedic elements because the cast was all comedians. Yet it still managed to blend action, tension, and drama in with that heavy comedy. (Also horror! Parts of Ghostbusters scared tf out of me as a kid!!)

But the Willow series... it felt like it was unintentionally all over the place."
Word Party Songs,100% agree!!
Word Party Songs,"I think the writers, actors, and showrunners didn't take their jobs too seriously."
Word Party Songs,I didn't want GoT. I was looking for a continuation of the film.
Word Party Songs,"I mean lucas'  writing  has always been b movie at best, its everyone else he works with that makes it better and the production value of the series is fine, its the writing that needs work. It fits."
Word Party Songs,"Not really, the old Corman films at least committed fully to the picture."
Word Party Songs,"The movie wasn't camp -- it was light comedy in a grimdark action adventure fantasy setting. When people say ""camp"", I think of things like John Waters' films and Willow was nothing like that.

Also stuff like Buffy is pretty campy and that is also nothing like the original Willow film.

Willow was basically the same tone as an Indiana Jones film, but set in a fantasy world. It blended action, fantasy, light comedy, drama, and tension together perfectly. The show, however, did not."
Word Party Songs,"As a woman, myself, I was all about having strong female leads. But I really didn't like these characters they wrote for the show. Especially not after seeing cool female characters in shows like Foundation and The Expanse.

The women in Willow acted like little babies...? (Well except Sorsha. She's always a badass. I wish there was more of her in the show.) Admittedly, I liked Mims a lot. She had very little screentime."
Word Party Songs,"Exactly. 

The brownie wore a onesie and a graphic tee. And those ladies in the woods wore a lot of denim and very modern hats. In the second to last episode, when we see the girl who plays the crone, she is wearing a hoodie and platform sandals."
Word Party Songs,Why is this post even at all.
Word Party Songs,"It is more pulpy ER Burroughs pulp style, imo.  The 80s was also towards the end of the B studios; Howard and Lucas had certainly graduated by the time Willow came out even if they include some of the ""b movie elements"" that worked in their A studio productions."
Word Party Songs,">it was light comedy in a grim dark action adventure fantasy setting.

That description tracks, but I’d argue it applies to the show as well."
Word Party Songs,"I can't agree because the show didn't have the grimdark aesthetic. Everything was very bright, almost cheerful looking. Even the cages down in the troll lair looked bright and cheery. People's faces looked so overly fresh and clean, which reminded me of how most Disney sitcoms look. It's that fake plastic sort of filter. Kind of unnerving in a way. When characters in the series did have dirt on their faces, it was all too strategically peppered across their flawless skin.

I miss the filth filter. One could take one look at Madmartigan -- his grubby hands and sweaty/soiled skin -- and *swear* you could smell his stench from where you were sitting. God I remember his *teeth.* He had rotten teeth in that cage. lol it was so disgusting.

I remember the people in the Inn/bar -- everyone there looked like they hadn't showered in months. So many sweaty, filthy actors. lol

Or just the whole scene where Madmartigan steps in troll shit -- that entire set was dark and terrifying. The trolls were chaotic and disgusting. They made horrible, inhuman sounds and crawled up walls like insects. The movie had so many disturbing elements.

The show wasnt grimdark. It could have been, but they watered it down so much. It was far too clean and bubbly."
Word Party Songs,Good for her.  Jane the Virgin was a pretty good satire of telenovelas.  Glad to see we'll get more from her.
Word Party Songs,"She's in a new show premiering this Wednesday, called 'Not Dead Yet on ABC. I wish her luck, she's been trying to find her second wind since JtW ended. 

> Nell Stevens, a broke, newly single and feeling old, self-described 40-something disaster, works to restart the life and career she left behind 10 years ago. When she lands the only job she can find - writing obituaries - Nell starts getting life advice from an unlikely source. (The Dead)"
Word Party Songs,"I'm interested in the adaptation of the podcast story she's in Last Known Position. I enjoyed the hell out of it, and she's great in it, but I haven't heard any more about it since it was announced."
Word Party Songs,I read that as Gina Carano and got really confused.
Word Party Songs,Who?
Word Party Songs,I did enjoy her VA work in Carmen Sandiego while it lasted
Word Party Songs,"Well actually, I think this lady almost got canceled too for some comments, too lazy to look it up but yeah, she doing ok it seems."
Word Party Songs,"Honest question: What do people like you who make comments like this - or even something like the ""This is still on?"" comments - get out of it? It seems like every thread has someone who makes a downvoted comment just like yours that doesn't seem to even serve a purpose. Do you smirk as you type it out and hit send, as if everyone's gonna find it uproariously hilarious, or do you just get off wasting your time perusing threads about subjects you don't know or care about *just* to inform everyone how little you don't know or care about them? It's just such a weird phenomenon that happens without fail in thread after thread after thread, and I just don't get the point."
Word Party Songs,She sang a song that used the n word on instagram
Word Party Songs,I'm sure they would respond to you if they knew how to read
Word Party Songs,"You spending the time to write out that outraged, serious essay condemning my obviously silly comment gave me exactly what I needed. Thank you. Weeeee!"
Word Party Songs,So a stupid reason then ? Highly doubt she meant it maliciously.
Word Party Songs,"I personally don't think its that big of a deal, but it isn't my place as a white person to determine what is or isn't a big deal"
Word Party Songs,[deleted]
Word Party Songs,"Great write up!


I'm not familiar with most of these, and I watch a shit-ton of TV and movies. I really like the effort, and the writeups are perfect in length.


Again, not knowing these a lot, is Severance the highest ranked English speaking show? (Nothing against non English speakers of course) 


Also, I'm guessing most of these are straight drama? Language and genre might both be useful things to put in parenthesis for anyone else unfamiliar.


Totally agree with the couple from White Lotus being great characters, I much preferred season 1 (which seems like a hot take) but those two, specifically the woman, were very interesting characters to me."
Word Party Songs,"How you pick what to watch? I’m overwhelmed with all these shows in Netflix and I always seem to pick the limited series or those talked about in reddit, especially regarding to the foreign shows or K dramas. There isn’t much write-ups or reviews in English."
Word Party Songs,I am glad and surprised Prisma is number one. Well deserved
Word Party Songs,"This is Going to Hurt: I'm a medical student and I thought I'd seen every medical show but this one is on my list now! I've heard that this show shows the reality of a doctor's life without all the glamor of medicine.  
  
This show compared to other medical shows what do you think and what other medical shows have you watched I'm curious!"
Word Party Songs,"Insanely odd for the 2 anime to show up to be an average romcom (with crazy production value) and a good but lesser known sequel.

(Oh NVM I thought this was a list from some website not yours! Still surprised to see MDUD though!)"
Word Party Songs,"""hidden gems of 2022 for me"" might be better title for this post.

i must admit some of these plots engaged my curiosity. im gonna look for them. rhanks for the list."
Word Party Songs,"What did Frank Ocean say that one time? ""I got two versions. I got twooo versions…""

..................

I didn't like what 2022 television had to offer for the most part. One too many disappointments for me as well. I mean I watched a lot more shows than I did in 2021, yet struggled to find 25 new shows for this list. But I do think my top 13 here are genuinely great.But anyways, thanks a lot for reading, even if you just scrolled through this lol. Same time, same place, next year? ❤️"
Word Party Songs,"Neat list.  A lot of shows I've not seen.

A few shows from 2022 I'd recommend if you haven't seen em:

- Black Bird

- SAS Rogue Heroes

- The Offer

- Under the Banner of Heaven"
Word Party Songs,Recency bias but I just finished Yellowjackets and really had a great time watching it.
Word Party Songs,No Atlanta? Both seasons last year were incredible
Word Party Songs,Pachinko is the most slept on series of 2022
Word Party Songs,"1. She hulk
2. Ted lasso
3. Ms Marvel
4. Harley Quinn show
5. Lord of the rings
6. Spy x family 
7. Chainsaw man
8. Loki
9. Mob psycho
10. Hot D"
Word Party Songs,Which ones did you see? 🤔 amma take a wild guess and say The Bear and Severance?
Word Party Songs,"> is Severance the highest ranked English speaking show?

Yes. Even though Pachinko got a bit of english too. 

> I'm guessing most of these are straight drama? Language and genre might both be useful things to put in parenthesis for anyone else unfamiliar.

Yea. And yea I should probably do that next time."
Word Party Songs,"i just read the synopsis and glance at the preview a bit sometimes just to check visual/production quality. if it looks like something that could be potentially great, i check it out."
Word Party Songs,🙂💕
Word Party Songs,It’s great but it’s depressing.
Word Party Songs,"What other new anime from 2022 did you think were great? 

Anime for me in 2022 was, *meh* tbh. I didn't like Summertime Rendering much and Chainsaw Man hasn't gotten to the good parts of the manga yet. I was suppose to see Bocchi The Rock! before making this list, but ended up getting an ear infection so couldn't."
Word Party Songs,I'd count Yellowjackets as 2021 TV show.

Tiny Creatures,"So, I guess their goal today was to take everyone who said D+ had no original content besides The Mandalorian, and pretty much punch them in the face repeatedly."
Tiny Creatures,Hooch is crazy
Tiny Creatures,/u/arashtp you missed Percy Jackson.
Tiny Creatures,"Nothing on any of the ""old"" Netflix series has me sad...  Nice write up, though."
Tiny Creatures,I thought this was wallstreebets DD for a second lol
Tiny Creatures,Super stoked on most of this. I’m especially looking forward to the Nat geo content. Can you imagine if Disney+ dropped with half of these titles? Game changer
Tiny Creatures,"So strange to realize Ice Age is owned by Disney now. 

Also I’m sort of unexpectedly excited about the continuation of Mighty Ducks!"
Tiny Creatures,"Based on the release timelines of those shows, it looks like their strategy is: 

Zeitgeist show for 6 weeks -> 1 week of cool down —> couple weeks of hype up -> next Zeitgeist show -> Repeat"
Tiny Creatures,They're really going all out with the High Republic.
Tiny Creatures,did She Hulk get a trailer or anything?
Tiny Creatures,that's a lot of content
Tiny Creatures,A Turner and Hooch reboot yyyeeeeessss!!! I've been a fan (we call ourselves Hoochers) for years and am flipping out right now!!!!
Tiny Creatures,Missing rogue squadron on Star Wars
Tiny Creatures,Hocus Pocus 2. What.
Tiny Creatures,"A lot of this is awesome, but can I just take a moment to appreciate *Sister Act 3*?"
Tiny Creatures,">Tiana is the first princess to have her own Walt Disney Animation Studios series

Just going to ignore the Little Mermaid and Tangled series apparently."
Tiny Creatures,[deleted]
Tiny Creatures,I have only read a hand full of moon knight comics but from what I have heard and read making a PG moon knight show is not going to go over well with fans.
Tiny Creatures,Any specific dates to go with this?
Tiny Creatures,You forgot the multiple tongue in cheek references to Matt Murdock.  Charlie Cox's Daredevil is officially part of the MCU now.  Hes apparently in She Hulk and Spider-Man 3.
Tiny Creatures,"Damn, the Ducks end up becoming what they rebelled against..."
Tiny Creatures,"As a bi dude I'm still waiting for literally anything big that features a non-straight dude. In film they ignored it almost completely out of fear of gay-hating countries banning it and them losing money (like China). 

Really hoping for something to come through, maybe with x-men back in the fold Iceman could get something"
Tiny Creatures,So is Ahsoka taking the place of the Rebels spinoff? Because thats what I was most excited for
Tiny Creatures,Disney is milking Star Wars and Marvel for everything dollar they can squeeze. There are way too many reboots and remakes. They need originally sourced content that has no reliance on existing IP. How about some original NON-Marvel/Star Wars scripted content? I think the Mandalorian is a cute show but I want to see ORIGINAL content for once. This slate of shows are not enough to keep all of their subscribers satisfied.
Tiny Creatures,Seems like Star Wars's future is on TV.
Tiny Creatures,Is it weird that I'm most excited for the Josh Peck version of Turner and Hooch?
Tiny Creatures,"Looks like they're updating Microcosmos with A Real Bug's Life, that should be cool as fuck."
Tiny Creatures,">The Mighty Ducks: Game Changers

>Lauren Graham (Gilmore Girls, Parenthood) and Emilio Estevez (reprising his role from the original feature films) star in the next chapter of the hit Mighty Ducks franchise, premiering in early 2021. In present day Minnesota, the Mighty Ducks have evolved from scrappy underdogs to an ultra-competitive, powerhouse youth hockey team. After 12-year-old Evan is unceremoniously cut from the Ducks, he and his mom Alex set out to build their own ragtag team of misfits to challenge the cutthroat, win-at-all-costs culture of competitive youth sports.

I hope Disney has been paying attn to Cobra Kai and takes all the good from it and applies it to the Ducks!!!"
Tiny Creatures,"Man, Tony Stark cannot keep control of his tech, can he? Well, I guess he's dead, so that makes sense."
Tiny Creatures,The one thing I want from Marvel is an OG Nick Fury and the Howling Commandos show.
Tiny Creatures,They forgot Shadow Hunters.
Tiny Creatures,I just want to have the spin off Thrawn and Ezra travels in space show.
Tiny Creatures,so much content that post alone made me vomit .
Tiny Creatures,"Hey, bozo, why didn't you mention It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia?

Great list, otherwise."
Tiny Creatures,Thanks man you're awesome
Tiny Creatures,[Rogue squadron](https://youtu.be/5bLkTjn6Y_s)
Tiny Creatures,Disney+ launch was more like beta test to ensure their decision of allocating such resources to the platform
Tiny Creatures,"The criticism was regarding lack of original screenplays, too. It's still true in that aspect."
Tiny Creatures,"It's still lacks diversity, it's still marvel, star wars and Pixar animated pg-13 movies, still no new new IPs."
Tiny Creatures,[deleted]
Tiny Creatures,"If they don't have Phill Lewis playing the dog using mocap, they dun goofed."
Tiny Creatures,*holds up lighter*
Tiny Creatures,And Swiss Family Robinson.
Tiny Creatures,"Just hints at Daredevil, from Sony in Spider-Man 3 and at the reveal here today for She-Hulk."
Tiny Creatures,"Yeah sounds like the Multiverse in SM3 will pull in Daredevil and Kingpin. Which could be great.

Daredevil was hinted at strongly for SheHulk, and there have been rumors that DNofrio has campaigned hard and they’ve taken him seriously as maybe using his character to put together the Sinister Six."
Tiny Creatures,"There's a big hint in Hawkeye. Maya Lopez is a definitively Daredevil character (Echo, a deaf woman who can see something once and imitate it originally hired by Kingpin to take out Daredevil and eventually befriending him). She also wore the Ronin outfit for awhile that Hawkeye wore in Endgame after his family vanished (New Avengers comics).

Edit: why am I being downvoted for this?"
Tiny Creatures,Not enough 🚀🚀🚀
Tiny Creatures,It’s pretty genius
Tiny Creatures,Super into the Acolyte as I’d really like to see what the Sith/dark side users were up to during this time period
Tiny Creatures,"No, but they confirmed Tatiana Maslany."
Tiny Creatures,Tim Roth will be back as Abomination and Mark Ruffalo.
Tiny Creatures,Its a rather deceptive line if your not in the know.  WDAS is the movie studio. Disney Television Animation is the studio that typically handles the TV side (they were the ones that made the Tangled series).
Tiny Creatures,That's not necessarily a bad thing tbh. It's how they execute it that matters. GOTG was kinda considered a bottom of the barrel IP for marvel before they made it and it turned out well.
Tiny Creatures,"There’s like 70 announced shows here and less than 10 are actual original ideas. Really disappointing *in my opinion*.

I get people like Star Wars and stuff, but it seems extreme to me."
Tiny Creatures,"I think it could be done. For me at least the fun part is the mind-bendy unreliable narrator stuff and not the graphic violence. Although there is something to be said for when other characters meet Moon Knight and are like, ""oh this guy is *crazy* crazy and not just *Batman* crazy."""
Tiny Creatures,"This didn’t mention any of the Marvel movies since it’s still not certain whether they’ll be released in theaters first or on Disney+ at the same time, but The Eternals is set to have their first openly gay main character whenever that’s released.

If you haven’t watched the Disney+ short film Out, you absolutely should."
Tiny Creatures,"Young Avengers is just over the horizon, and that comes with the most prominent gay couple in marvel. Still a few years out though."
Tiny Creatures,Not sure if it is 100% confirmed but I remember seeing somewhere that Valkyrie is looking for a wife in the next Thor movie.
Tiny Creatures,"As a fellow homo, I'm sorry you're getting downvoted, but that's r/television for you. I've learned not to bring up representation issues on this sub anymore."
Tiny Creatures,"I would bet it will be in a team, or they will reveal the character is gay in a sequel...that way people in China will already be invested.  Because you’re right....they want that China money badly. 


Wouldn’t it be a kick in the nuts to China if the wait until like Shang Chi 3 and reveal he was gay the whole time! Lmao. That could literally start a war!!"
Tiny Creatures,I really don't like the sound of this. The whole point of the Ducks is that they are scrappy underdogs. Having them become what they played against feels kind of weird. And it's obviously gonna end with both Ducks teams playing against each other. It just sounds weird to me.
Tiny Creatures,"I feel like this'll be a big part of the Ashoka show, considering that she was still searching when we see her in The Mandolorian."
Tiny Creatures,That’s pathetic
Tiny Creatures,Thats not on Disney+ you 1 star fool.
Tiny Creatures,"They're going all in because they've lost all profits from Disney parks and tourism, 75% of their revenue.

Also why they gutted ESPN"
Tiny Creatures,"Certainly, but was anyone really expecting that? Aside from Pixar, Disney hasn't done an original story in... I'm not sure. Possibly ever."
Tiny Creatures,Pixar films are all new IPs lol
Tiny Creatures,[deleted]
Tiny Creatures,One Star Wars IP will drive more total interest than anything on HBO Max lmao
Tiny Creatures,"Uh ""Win or Lose"" is a new IP."
Tiny Creatures,"You are soo right. Marvel has been overdone, it's a stale medium at this point.  SW feels the same after the last 3 movies. Even Mando is aimless with no real main plotline.

It's so formulaic it isn't appealing.

Will smith movie,
Cars tv show, 
SW, SW, SW, SW, SW
Marvel movies or shows of all side movie characters, because why not saturate the market with bland superheros"
Tiny Creatures,"Yeah. Did anyone really expect Disney to do something genuinely new? Aside from Pixar, which still has very niche content, I can't remember the last time Disney did an actually new story. 

It's one of the reasons this obsession people on here have with D+ ""killing"" Netflix is so silly."
Tiny Creatures,Well original content in this context means content that is developed specificity for the platform and is owned by Disney
Tiny Creatures,"
>Daredevil was hinted at strongly for SheHulk...

That doesn't excite me...  I don't see Daredevil remaining dark and gritty if placed in She-Hulk.  SH over the years has been more of a fun loving character."
Tiny Creatures,"It's going to be interesting to see how Tim Roth plays his take on Mark Ruffalo. 

&nbsp;

^^i ^^jest"
Tiny Creatures,[deleted]
Tiny Creatures,"It's a Disney property.

They a announced it today, as well.

It actually appears on traditional broadcast television, anyone who can't see this **IS A SAVAGE AND AN IDIOT**.

Stoked about almost all of these, though."
Tiny Creatures,Most of these projects are planned before the COVID
Tiny Creatures,Different services provide different content. I dont see why that's only an issue when it's Disney. How much Oscar winning animated content do we see on HBO or Netflix?
Tiny Creatures,Duh.  If you want Disney's adult content you mosey over to Hulu.  If you've been looking at the end of the year critics' lists you'll have noticed Disney is beating Netflix and Warnerbrothers decisively when it comes to critical acclaim.
Tiny Creatures,Disney doesn’t give a fuck about that. They care about commercial success of which they aren’t matched.
Tiny Creatures,The show is listed as a comedy. Not sure how Charlie's Matt Murdock would fit into that.
Tiny Creatures,"I get it. But AntMan seemed really dumb to me. So did Thor at the time, and GotG is when I thought they had given up. 

I think the Series will be used to set up bigger events in the movies.  Almost like a Rogue One to Star Wars.  

That way people who want more background will have it, and yet you don’t HAVE to have seen it to follow the movies.  

Also Ironheart, Kate Bishop, Ms Marvel and I’m betting a Young Loki will get set up for a Secret Avengers movie."
Tiny Creatures,"Armor Wars is widely considered one of the best, if not the best period, Iron Man stories.

We’ll most likely see Justin Hammer return and the intro of some other big Iron Man villains like Crimson Dynamo.

I wouldn’t call it bottom of the barrel. The only difference is that War Machine will he finally getting the spotlight rather than Iron Man"
Tiny Creatures,"Well, you have to remember, when they first started making Marvel movies, Iron Man was a very odd choice in how to begin."
Tiny Creatures,Yes.  Can they only make outer space/superhero stuff?  That’s not the only genre.
Tiny Creatures,"This is interesting, but it’s super hard to follow who each doctor was based on number alone. Is there an easy reference list to which actors played each of them?"
Tiny Creatures,"I believe you can apply it to music bands, and the fun part is that you can apply the pattern to any piece of any song of the band (it's like a fractal: every piece look alike)

Bonus with *inane* music band analogies:

Twelfth Doctor = [I Like Trains eg A Rook House for Bobby](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7LQ9We7Tyc)

- **They've made mountains out of mole hills** *Let them climb They can chase me* **to the ends Of the Earth**

- **And if they find me** *Let them indite me I just don't care any more* **They've pushed me too far, too far**

- *All this talk of war But it's only a game*

""circumstances and outcomes... and facts of life"" (and walling off until a conclusion is reached )


Thirteenth Doctor = [Eurythmics eg Here Comes the Rain Again](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzFnYcIqj6I)  (taking alternative description) or [Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qeMFqkcPYcg)

- *Here comes the rain again ~Falling on my head like a memory Falling on my head like a new emotion~* (+) *~So baby talk to me Like lovers do Walk with me Like lovers do Talk to me~*

- *~Sweet dreams are made of this Who am I to disagree?~ I've traveled the world and the seven seas ~Everybody's lookin' for something~* (+) *~Some of them want to use you Some of them want to get used by you Some of them want to abuse you Some of them want to be abused~*

""circumstances and ~the most important static circumstances (states) at the moment~""


Tenth Doctor = [~Linkin Park eg Burning In The Skies](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh_YCSW5lPc)

- *I'm swimming in the smoke Of bridges* **I have burned** *So don't apologize* **I'm losing what** *I don't deserve What I don't deserve*

- *We held our breath when the clouds began to form* **But you were lost in the beating of the storm**

""the most important fact [at the moment] and the most important outcome""


Ninth Doctor = Scooter eg [Break It Up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dyvYQEEWv8) or [How Much Is The Fish?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbB3iGRHtqA)

- *I don't care if* **you leave me** *I don't care if* **you go away** *I don't care if you wanted this I don't mind*

- **We're breaking the rules** *Ignore the machine* **You won't ever stop this** *The chase is better than the catch*

""multiple facts about some circumctances (sometimes) leading to an outcome""

Another version of ""Post Scriptum"": (I apologize for bothering you)

All people for me are like heroes, no less. I know this is very improbable that I will be able to help anybody with this ""pattern language"", but there's a chance no matter how small and miniscule and absurd sounding (and it's better than nothing, better than to do nothing at all)

Maybe you can test this theory about speaking patterns with modern day technology such as [Transformer (machine learning model)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformer_(machine_learning_model))

Please help me if this all is worth it, if it's original!"
Tiny Creatures,Great high-quality post!
Tiny Creatures,"You should submit this on /r/gallifrey, they'd find it quite interesting there."
Tiny Creatures,Don't you mean Doctors (from 12609 - 12613)?
Tiny Creatures,Sorry you had watch 13 for this
Tiny Creatures,"Just to chime in, Tenth is the one who more closely resembles a scientist while speaking, he talks about process all the time and also comments on the effects of certain actions. Eleventh is also kinda jovial but also discusses his inner confusion or uncertainty all the time.

Great diggest, early X-Files episodes or Dark (German Netflix show) also had a similar pattern with Scully or The Stranger."
Tiny Creatures,"9 Christopher Eccelston

10 David Tennant

11 Matt Smith

Thank you very much and I'm glad another redditor already helped"

Tiny Creatures,"Thank you for the answer and for the direction,

I would've skipped this!"
Tiny Creatures,You [got](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctors_(2000_TV_series)) me there
Tiny Creatures,"I agree very much about the scientist! That what I was thinking about...

Scully may be more close to 13th (alternative description), but that's a ""scientific"" & explanatory style of speaking too, just less ""crazy-scientific"" & more calm/stable

Thank you for the character ""The Stranger"", I agree with you about his speech 100% (every bit he says is a big/self-sustained point)

I regret that more people don't ""chime in"", it's always very great and helps very much and inspires to see others' takes on this"

Sing On! Germany,"Norway doesn't have a tradition to watch this on New Years Eve, we watch it on December 23rd. Yes, we know it's a New Years sketch, but the tradition is still the 23rd which we call 'little Christmas Eve'."
Sing On! Germany,Used to watch it in the Netherlands as well. Then one year they just stopped.
Sing On! Germany,A German friend introduced me to this a few years ago she couldn’t believe we had never seen this in the UK or knew who Freddy Frinton was.
Sing On! Germany,"The same procedure as last year, Miss Sophie?"
Sing On! Germany,Just watched that at dinner. Kids went crazy by the tiger head jump. 😂
Sing On! Germany,Not seen in Finland
Sing On! Germany,Never shown in Britain except for once a few years ago when they decided to let people know what the foreigners were on about.
Sing On! Germany,"It's also shown *exactly* at 9PM. One time they showed it *before* that, which resulted in angry phone calls and a rerun at 9PM.

Sing On! Germany,Does this mean there is a Scrubs/Cougar Town Cinematic Universe?
Sing On! Germany,Cougartown is a really good show. They quickly abandon the 'cougar' aspect after the first few episodes.
Sing On! Germany,">	In January 2019, Lloyd was diagnosed with an inoperable brain tumor, which was subsequently revealed to be metastatic lung cancer that had spread to his liver, spine, and jaw. His wife Vanessa had given birth to their son, Weston, around the time Lloyd received his diagnosis. He died on April 30, 2020, in Los Angeles at the age of 56.

>	Lloyd is best known for his portrayal of lawyer Ted Buckland on the comedy-drama series Scrubs and the sitcom Cougar Town. He and his uncle both guest starred on Malcolm in the Middle, Lloyd as a housing lawyer and his uncle as Hal's father. The two also guested on The West Wing, Lloyd requesting the White House to release information about UFOs and his uncle as a constitutional law expert. He also appeared in Desperate Housewives as Albert Goldfine. Aside from acting, Lloyd was an accomplished singer with the a cappella group The Blanks, who made many appearances on Scrubs under the name The Worthless Peons (also known as Ted's Band). He also played the bass guitar in a Beatles tribute group called the Butties; although right-handed, he learned to play bass left-handed like Beatles bassist Paul McCartney to maintain authenticity."
Sing On! Germany,His music always gets mentioned but he was FUNNY as FUCK! Just amazing comedic timing and did a lot of great physical comedy and prat falls.
Sing On! Germany,"He was a Worthless Peon and he will always be a Worthleds Peon

You guys know his band right? The Worthless Peons?"
Sing On! Germany,Anyone have the chord chart for this version?
Sing On! Germany,"Sam's death is one that I feel really sad for. He was a wonderful comic actor. Had some brilliant physical comedy moments in Scrubs. The flop sweat hitting the desk being one of the best. 

Amazing singer and I love the blanks covers of a lot of songs. Somewhere over the rainbow makes me feel so sad he is no longer with us. From the stories on the podcast it seems like Sam was a great person as well. He should have had a long happy life."
Sing On! Germany,"Man, I miss Scrubs. I miss that time in general."
Sing On! Germany,"So needless to say

Of odds and ends

But I'll be stumbling away

Slowly learning that life is okay

It's no better to be safe than sorry"

Not you, Ted. Get back to work :P"
Sing On! Germany,"Damn, didn’t know he died"
Sing On! Germany,"wait so scrubs and cougartown is in the same universe?  


I gotta watch cougartown then"
Sing On! Germany,i didn't know ted lasso created scrubs.
Sing On! Germany,My only wish is that Sam lived long enough to get a cameo in Ted Lasso (seeing the two Ted's together would've been golden.) But I mainly wish he could've seen his friend Bill Lawrence win his first Emmy for writing.
Sing On! Germany,RIP he was legit. His cover of hey ya is tear worthy
Sing On! Germany,Wow he really hit that high note tho eh
Sing On! Germany,"He was my favorite character on scrubs by far, and his version of “hey ya” was amazing"
Sing On! Germany,"This hit me right in the feels.

Perfect end to this shit day. Now I'm depressed over the passing of a great actor who sang a favorite song of mine. 

This depression is never going to stop is it? There's always one more punch just around the corner..."
Sing On! Germany,RIP
Sing On! Germany,"> from the creator of Scrubs, Ted Lasso

This reads like Ted Lasso created Scrubs, rather than both shows having the same creator"
Sing On! Germany,I will never not stop and listen when this gets posted. Scrubs got me through medical school and residency.
Sing On! Germany,Uncle Christopher was 81 when his nephew died
Sing On! Germany,"jfc he only died last year? I thought he died like 4 years ago. The last 20 months have been like a decade long, argh. 

I always wonder how it feels to be an actor who's best known for playing a sad sack. Like, obviously he must've been okay with it, but you must have some good self-esteem to play someone like Ted for so long and not get depressed.

Make no mistake, I love Sam Lloyd, I'm impressed with his work."
Sing On! Germany,I always liked Ted's band singing Underdog: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=gUO1kFs3tLc
Sing On! Germany,"Will always remember seeing The Blanks in concert. Just a very small venue and me and my dad were sitting front row because we got there waaayyy too early, because I was so excited. Just pure joy, played all the hits. Always wished I could see them live again..."
Sing On! Germany,RIP Sam
Sing On! Germany,I wonder if this is where they got the idea to have Ellie play it in Last of Us 2.
Sing On! Germany,"His band, The Blanks, did a cover of Hey Ya that is absolutely awesome."
Sing On! Germany,[It's more of a multiverse situation.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qaWrBOziiLo#t=43s)
Sing On! Germany,Community (Abed) even had a small crossover with it! Scrubs alums made it into Cougartown a good bit too
Sing On! Germany,[Yes.](https://scrubs.fandom.com/wiki/Cougar_Town)
Sing On! Germany,It’s hard to say. Zach Braff exists as Zach Braff in Cougar Town and there’s the scene where the Cougar Town characters are watching Scrubs. Ted is the same Ted from Scrubs though and the timelines of him leaving with Gooch and ending up in Hawaii line up. Bill Lawrence wondered about the shared universe between Scrubs and Cougar Town on the Scrubs podcast and seemed confused too.
Sing On! Germany,I waited a long time to watch cause of the stupid name. So glad I finally watched - love that show.
Sing On! Germany,"Look, if you want me to take it seriously, stop saying its name."
Sing On! Germany,He learned to play the bass left handed to maintain authenticity. What a fucking legend!
Sing On! Germany,"""Ted we found you in the park throwing rocks at old people.""

""Why should they be happy?!"""

Cougar Town is a great show, terrible name for a show and the first half of the first season is kinda rough but once they hit their stride and it's just Scrubs without the hospital."
Sing On! Germany,But how does Cougarton Abbey fit into this?
Sing On! Germany,"I agree, the comedy is so good. I love the title card jokes and I’ve recorded several clips to send to friends to convince them to watch.

Sing On! Germany,"I just copy and pasted from google... official video close captioning shows ""I'm odd and ends"".   I thought this passage overall just kind of got my feelings of Sam being gone and enjoying life anyway.
https://youtu.be/djV11Xbc914"
Sing On! Germany,Thanks for that. I may just do that.
Sing On! Germany,"[Yup, when the Janitor gets married](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=QEYcfHoWm2s)
  
Also, a bonus [Ted Tangent Song](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=7yxQKxm76TQ)"
Sing On! Germany,Ive been obsessed with that scene lately.
Sing On! Germany,That last clip was 🔥 🔥 I started acting the same way as Ted when Zack Braff showed up
Sing On! Germany,That's exactly what old you would say!
Sing On! Germany,Cougartown is amazing. After 8 or so episodes it drops the entire premise and just becomes about a group of friends who drink wine all day. It's made by Bill Lawrence as well so it definitely has that Scrubs feel to it.
Sing On! Germany,"Two characters from cougartown also appeared briefly in the background of an episode of Community. I want to say it was a paintball episode, but I could be wrong."
Sing On! Germany,"I recently rewatched Cougar Town and it’s better than I remember. Jules, Courtney Cox’s character, only plays the cougar angle in the pilot and the first few episodes. After that the show is about all the characters just living their lives. It’s a very warm, feel-good show. Highly recommend."
Sing On! Germany,Great Scott!
Sing On! Germany,I was wondering why the above article kept mentioning his uncle.
Sing On! Germany,The root beer guy?
Sing On! Germany,Odd choice for a wedding song considering most of the lyrics
Sing On! Germany,Didn’t Bill Lawrence even say that he regretted the title of the show in the end?
Sing On! Germany,Change approved!
Sing On! Germany,You'd be right.  They were outside for the final showdown in season 2.
Sing On! Germany,"Okay, now I want to see a cameo from one if the members of Community on Ted Lasso and I want to see a TedLasso reference in the eventual Community movie."
Sing On! Germany,The last name didn't clue you in?
Sing On! Germany,Ted was an odd guy.
Sing On! Germany,"Yes. In the intro sequence they also mock the name of the show several times and in the last episode the title card says ""Sunshine State"" rather than Cougartown."
Sing On! Germany,"They already have a Community guy on Ted Lasso.

[Coach Beard was the guy who sang Jesus Loves Marijuana in the Kiss from a Rose song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVcxjxLipf0)"
Sing On! Germany,Is Jake Lloyd also related to them? Otherwise just having the same last name as someone doesn't mean you're related.
Sing On! Germany,So was Jan-E-Tor
Sing On! Germany,Holy cow that's amazing! I didn't know that was the guy who played Beard! And he can sing!? Oh now I want him and Rebecca to duet.
Sing On! Germany,Demand for physical media no longer justifies the cost of manufacturing in most cases. Discs are a niche thing now.
Sing On! Germany,DVD sales are down 82% in the last 10 years. Suspect that for TV shows it’s even worse than that.
Sing On! Germany,"Well, streaming happened, so the number of people who would've bought stuff on disc dwindled. 

And yeah, the companies would rather rent you content on a monthly basis than have you pay them a flat fee for it once and never again."
Sing On! Germany,There isn't a market for them.
Sing On! Germany,"Studios aren't forcing digital/streaming on you to make more money. In fact, they made more money from physical releases. Selling tapes/discs used to be a huge part of their revenue model.

But now that streaming exists, there's less demand for DVDs. Sure, you want Blu-rays, but overall, fewer and fewer people bought those over the last decade, so studios cut back on making them."
Worlds Most Wanted,If every Star Trek had a commander with as good of hair as Pike they would be bigger than Marvel.
Worlds Most Wanted,"Crazy concept, make a proper Trek show and people get excited about it.

Hopefully this is a very good sign that if they do more series they'll be episodic and not the DSC/PIC season long universe ending disasters. And ideally we'll get a post-PIC show. What I would love to see more than anything is the Enterprise F and it's adventures."
Worlds Most Wanted,"I never watched Star Trek, but this was really really good. Can’t wait for season 2."
Worlds Most Wanted,That's because it's not filled with people whisper crying every 5 fucking minutes.
Worlds Most Wanted,"Without viewership numbers from the streaming service or a third-party corroboration, these type of statements ""Most Watched/Biggest Premiere"" are worthless to say the least.


Like [Ben Stiller](https://decider.com/2022/08/09/severance-ben-stiller-interview-emmys-2022/?) said the other day about the lack of viewership data:

> ""But you don’t know what the baseline is. I guess could be like, based on 100 people or could be like, 200 million people. We don’t know."""
Worlds Most Wanted,Not surprising as it's the best Trek show they've done so far.
Worlds Most Wanted,"Yeah, because they made classic Trek and it is a fucking grand slam of a Trek series already. It is fantastic."
Worlds Most Wanted,"Maybe because it is good?   Maybe because it engages you as a Trekkie?   Maybe because the social aspects aren't so on the nose, and intended to be the initial force behind the characters developments."
Worlds Most Wanted,Alright! This is great news! Now time for some Stargate!! Please 🙏
Worlds Most Wanted,Because it's fucking awesome.
Worlds Most Wanted,"Currently watching it , took me 5 episodes to realize that’s Rebbeca Romijn as number 1 ( I’m a fucking idiot)"
Worlds Most Wanted,"The next AMA or Comic Panel, someone should ask ""how much of Section 31 was recycled and used for Strange New Worlds?""."
Worlds Most Wanted,"ITs really good, I can’t wait for more."
Worlds Most Wanted,You mean a Star Trek show with nuance actually works?
Worlds Most Wanted,Itz a good a show
Worlds Most Wanted,DISC apologists in shambles
Worlds Most Wanted,"... other than Prodigy, a kid-skewed animated project, it's the only Star Trek series to debut on the service, as the previous did so under the CBS All Access banner, so this headline means absolutely nothing."
Worlds Most Wanted,"I like it as it's much more in the spirit of the franchise than the New Drek stuff but it still has a ways to go before being in a conversation with TNG and DS9. I can't quite define how and why, but it feels to me like they've got all the superficial elements of good Trek stories down (mood/ambientation, storylines and so on) but I still miss the ""filling"", so to speak. More philosophical and scientific weirdness, deeper contradictions to solve...filling in the shapes, which The Orville has done pretty magnificently in their third season. But SNW has a lot of promise and I'm excited for where they take it (as long as they ditch Not-Kirk going forward)."
Worlds Most Wanted,"Wait when you dont produce dogshit that fits the universe it plays in its successful?  

surprisedpikachuface.png"
Worlds Most Wanted,"Is it wrong to say that the two animated series are also better than Discovery and Picard? 

I know a lot of people point to the serialized vs episodic nature but I don’t think that’s The true culprit. It’s the tone and writing of disco and Picard that make them so hard to swallow. 

Since no one asked my personal ranking is Lower Decks, Strange new worlds and then prodigy."
Worlds Most Wanted,They need to put in on CBS prime time
Worlds Most Wanted,"Imagine giving the fans what they want in a show

The only complaint I have about SNW is its connection to the dumpster fire that is Discovery. Thankfully it's looking like they are trying to distance themselves from it. I'm excited to see what they do in season 2 and hopefully beyond."
Worlds Most Wanted,Good news. Maybe now they decide to go back to old format and continue the good wave SNW started
Worlds Most Wanted,The show is great it left the politics behind for good storytelling I think the other shows should follow its lead and leave something’s for other shows that do just that.
Worlds Most Wanted,[deleted]
Worlds Most Wanted,All my fellow r/startrek refugees in here finally able to rip on Discovery and Picard without fear of any toxic positivity mods. Makes me smile.
Worlds Most Wanted,"good, after the melodramatic junk that is discovery SNW is like pure gold, even the orville is better Star trek than discovery."
Worlds Most Wanted,"It was fantastic. You have to give them credit for actually listening to fans. It had the optimism, exploration, fun, sci-fi, all the best of trek. Some of the roles I think still need to ""grow their beard"" but it's so promising. Maybe the best first season of trek since TOS."
Worlds Most Wanted,Thats because its actually a decent Star Trek show. Not the Michael Burnham crying hour or the Old man pretending to be Picard show.
Worlds Most Wanted,The Orville has changed the tone.
Worlds Most Wanted,Can't believe it took this long to get star trek right.
Worlds Most Wanted,"This is a meaningless headline. As Paramount+'s subscriber base continues to grow, it wouldn't be surprising if each successive series becomes the ""most watched original"" upon its debut. Discovery debuted around 5 years ago and Picard is about 2 years old. Discovery did not even debut on the streaming service. Its first two episodes were on CBS television."
Worlds Most Wanted,Not a very high bar.
Worlds Most Wanted,"This show thought me one thing....

I just don't like Star Trek

Glad the Trekkies finally got a show they enjoy though."
Worlds Most Wanted,"They did gain more than 35 million subscribers over the last 18 months so it is not surprising it beat the debuts of Discovery, Picard, and Lower Decks. 

Be nice if they told us how viewership compared to the most recent seasons of those other Trek shows."
Worlds Most Wanted,It’s fantastic. Best Star Trek series since the 90s
Worlds Most Wanted,It's like they finally strapped Kurtzman to a chair and made him watch The Orville to make him understand what people actually want.
Worlds Most Wanted,"One interesting thing about this new Trek is how well paced it is. The episodes feel long like watching a film as it's just packed with story and tension, and the quality in terms of production values and attention to detail is very high.  You also don't really know what to expect. 

It's refreshing compared to the garbage like the recent Disney's Star Wars. One thing you don't have in this new Trek are the dumb action scenes you get in modern Star Wars like if some 9 year old wrote it. Things are better thought out and even when the Enterprise crew thinks they have an upper hand they usually get outsmarted by their adversaries having to regroup and rethink their strategy. There is a lot more though put into each situation and how it will play out. 

I felt like I was watching TNG or old Trek with less crew drama. I like almost all of the characters and the space battles and locations have been pretty sweet thus far. It does a good job at being sci-fi which is a good sign in my book. 

I hope season 2 keeps up or exceeds what we have had thus far. They seemed to have done some nice foreshadowing as well, like with the Romulans so we'll have to see where it goes."
Worlds Most Wanted,"Paramount+ in an alternate dimension is still flexing about how ‘Halo’ became a cultural phenomenon. Shattering streaming records. 

The amount of people that either don’t know about it or are completely indifferent speaks volumes. And I actually liked the Halo series."
Worlds Most Wanted,Crazy concept. They left politics out of this series (for the most part) and it thrived.
Worlds Most Wanted,"As well as the only one I've enjoyed watching (Picard S01 was alright, S02 went to the zoo right out of the gate).  I hope they grow SNW with love and care."
Worlds Most Wanted,I really enjoyed it.
Worlds Most Wanted,"They should really just call it **”The New OG Star Trek”** for people who never really watched the originals and for fans of the original series that were more about science and simple stories each episode.

Makes the series much more easy to watch after a day of work, no anticipation or wondering what’s happening and building up.

Just a simple short and entertaining with some interesting science fiction theories every episode.

That’s not to say the other series are bad, just some of them are more about the story than interactions every episode."
Worlds Most Wanted,"Can i watch it without watching discovery first?

Is pike ever show up in discovery?"
Worlds Most Wanted,"They need to give the new captain a pair. At some point, or just once in a while, he needs to choose to fight. Like, ever. Otherwise it was really good"
Worlds Most Wanted,I mean it doesn’t have much competition lmao
Worlds Most Wanted,"Well, tbh it's their second season."
Worlds Most Wanted,The characters look really clean. I can tell it’s gonna be cheesy just from that lol
Worlds Most Wanted,It's so fucking good. Christ it's good.
Worlds Most Wanted,IDK.  DS9 was pretty good captains hair notwithstanding.
Worlds Most Wanted,"In some episodes Janeway had a damn ice cream scoop on her head, thinking about it her hair matched her personality, it was whatever that current episode felt like it should be."
Worlds Most Wanted,This show made me realise how much I've missed Stargate. I really hope Amazon does something with it now that they have the rights.
Worlds Most Wanted,"I'm still of the mind that it isn't as ""proper"" as a lot of people think, it's just so much better than other recent garbage.  I still think they over dramatize and over emphasize the personal baggage compared to the old classics, but still much less so than anything recent so it seems like a breath of fresh air.  That and there's episodic story telling again.  What bugs me is there aren't any episodes that are just about the episodic story, every one has to be like 50% crew member drama, 50% story.  Hopefully they get away from that after we've learned ""enough"" about the characters."
Worlds Most Wanted,The problem with DISC and PIC is not that they’re not episodic. The problem is that the writing was crap.
Worlds Most Wanted,"They’ll do what they have always have done: make a variety of shows that play around in the Trek universe.

Not all the shows are and should be reskins of SNW."
Worlds Most Wanted,DSC is fubar
Worlds Most Wanted,"For sure. I liked Picard, but it wasn't really the sort of show I love in the Star Trek universe. It was lots of fan service and some interesting themes.

Discovery...meh. I like some of the things they did, some of the characters, but they just didn't execute any of their big ideas well at all. IMO The Orville did more or less the same thing that Discovery tried, but did it ten times better on every front."
Worlds Most Wanted,[deleted]
Worlds Most Wanted,I haven’t checked it out yet? Is it any good as a prequel to TOS?
Worlds Most Wanted,"Whether or not the showrunners actually followed through, I know that a lot of fans jumped to SNW because it was marketed in many places as a return to form; the premiere pulling such huge numbers doesn’t surprise me that much."
Worlds Most Wanted,This right here is high praise.
Worlds Most Wanted,You should watch Discovery if you haven’t. I liked it more than this series. I still like this series tho.
Worlds Most Wanted,Disc season 2 only. It's basically one long pilot for Strange New Worlds
Worlds Most Wanted,"“Yeah, science”"
Worlds Most Wanted,"Funny how that whisper crying show is also where the three main characters on SNW came from, and if it wasn't for that whisper crying character getting a storyline about being related to spock (which I remember fans losing their shit about) this show would even exist. But yeah let's talk shit on everything we don't like."
Worlds Most Wanted,"I kind of get why streamers hide these numbers though because they will always be taken out of context and warped to fit a positive or negative narrative. It would happen all the time with Nielsen ratings when they mattered. The same rating for the same show could have a positive spin in one headline from, say, THR and a negative one in Variety. Add to that the fact that no streamer is on a level playing field. Netflix has 200 million subscribers worldwide, Disney's nearing 100 million, Paramount 40, something like Peacock even less. With Amazon and Apple the numbers are even less relevant since tons of people might have it and not use it. So like, if we find out 2 or 3 million people watched SNW, someone would compare it to like the 90 million that watched Stranger Things and say that's bad, ignoring the context, when that could be a satisfactory number for Paramount.

Never mind that an individual show's profitability to a streamer is harder to maintain when there's no tangible measure such as ad sales or box office. The value of a subscriber's time is intangible.

And don't get me wrong, I do think all this stuff should be public especially since all the creative people don't have the metrics to ask for proper compensation and I'm sure the concept of residuals or continued payments for existing work is all fucked now, and I agree it's basically useless marketing to announce this, but I understand why they don't release that info. 

Also, ultimately, they want this show to succeed so it is a good thing that they're putting weight behind its perceived success."
Worlds Most Wanted,It's meaningful here because it shows that fans were right and the classic Trek formula is what we wanted all along.
Worlds Most Wanted,Lower Decks is fantastic.
Worlds Most Wanted,The best Trek show since DS9 ended.
Worlds Most Wanted,Hell yeah it is.  My one enduring gripe?  The space scenes are lit too dark.  Ever since Discovery the Starfleet ships have been only visible by meager ambient light dimly reflected  off their dark gray metallic hulls instead of the soothing off-white from before.  It's an excuse to show off their fancy CGI reflection effects but we can barely make out anything other than the shape of the ship!  For me the gold standard of modern CGI ships is Rogue One where the stark bone white Star Destroyers looked like the physical models from 1977.
Worlds Most Wanted,"Are you seriously telling me you don't need to know someones sexuality or that their super mega genius boss fight mom died 7 times every episode?  

If not then how do you know why they do what they do?!?!?!?!"
Worlds Most Wanted,">Maybe because the social aspects aren't so on the nose

They literally used the January 6th footage and talked about how Civil War and shit led to World War 3 and the Eugenics Wars...

Not so on the nose??"
Worlds Most Wanted,"None of it, because it's still being developed...."
Worlds Most Wanted,👋 Bye have a great time 👍
Worlds Most Wanted,There's no way Discovery's debut could ever outperform that of SNW since they started when the streaming service was in its infancy (as CBS All Access) in addition to the fact that it never had its debut on stream. It started on broadcast CBS. No need for apologists.
Worlds Most Wanted,"I mean, Anson Mount as Pike first appeared on DISC.  The reason SNW exists is because people watched those Discovery episodes and said ""yes, more of that please."""
Worlds Most Wanted,"Why? I enjoy Discovery and I enjoy Strange New Worlds. I'm not a Discovery fan, I'm a Trek fan. The more Trek the better in my book."
Worlds Most Wanted,DSC is alright in different ways.  I personally liked the jump to the ruined far future - one that isn’t necessarily peaceful and dominated by the Federation.
Worlds Most Wanted,I think you mean Gene Roddenberry's Andromeda. Somehow Discovery doesn't even manage to do that better than the 1990s version.
Worlds Most Wanted,Star Trek fans who like Discovery like Strange New Worlds too. Star Trek fans who hate Discovery actually like it but are too racist to admit they watch it.
Worlds Most Wanted,did you forget lower decks?
Worlds Most Wanted,The problem with prodigy is that it's made for not particularly bright children.
Worlds Most Wanted,"Prodigy is just a Star wars story that has a crossover with Captain Janeway.

Think about it there's a sith Lord and lightsabers."
Worlds Most Wanted,[deleted]
Worlds Most Wanted,"I think The Orville was incredible in S3 but I don't know if I agree that it's as deep as you claim it to be.

For instance the Topa episodes and the whole trans arc is elegantly and interestingly handled but that's not really a topic where the conclusion can be all that nuanced. Ultimately they reject oppression as any advanced society would and should, regardless of the cost. That's the message and it's an obvious conclusion. These are some of the best eps of any sci fi show I've seen in a long time, don't get me wrong, but is that ""deep"" or just obvious commentary on an ongoing issue that people need to hear? Between that and a sort of poor-man's take on the Dominion/Borg wars from Star Trek, they're doing really, really good pop sci fi, but at the end of the day they're more often than not playing dress up.

Is SNW ""deeper""? Debatably. They're setting up stuff, building characters, dealing with existing canon, but they're trying different things and approaching topics in a much more nuanced way IMO. The main arc is Pike dealing with his notions of duty and fate, knowing what happens to him when he has his accident, and whether or not he can do anything to change it or even should. There's a deeper philosophical conversation there than anything I've seen on The Orville IMO. Especially since, when you think about it, it's a pretty unique almost meta way to deal with the fact that this is a prequel that's a spinoff of a spinoff of a spinoff set in a well-treaded part of time, 50 years after the debut of the franchise. How it's dealt with existing canon and the very question of whether they should be doing this shit is interesting to me as well. It's quite frankly astonishing that they've managed to take specific references, villains, even full episodes of TOS and properly give their takes on them.

But there are direct parallels too, individual episodes where, for example, The Enterprise goes to a planet that's reverse engineered a warp drive to use as a weapon, or sacrifices children to keep a society idyllic, or the one where they're dealing with a society that adapts their behaviour based on whom they're negotiating with... that's more interesting to me than say the Reddit society episode from The Orville which they brought back, or even the Kaylon origin story which I thought was well done but pretty basic. 

I love both shows and don't want this to be a NuTrek vs Orville thing but they're doing two very different things with similar window dressing.,"
Worlds Most Wanted,It's first season was better than the first season of either TNG or DS9. Go back and try to drag yourself through those seasons.
Worlds Most Wanted,"SNW has typical ""Season 1 Trek"" issues. I think if we compare Trek season 1's across the franchise it ranks pretty well."
Worlds Most Wanted,"this is a great take. the writing ATM is absolutely not up to the quality of TNG,DS9,E, or V. its also very modern in that the writing is not so sensible. CG and IP do a bit of lifting for it. but, a LOT less lifting than anything since Enterprise. the filling you speak of, is good writing. truly interesting stories. which haven't happened yet, but, the potential can be seen. its about twenty steps in the right direction for modern interpretations of Star Trek."
Worlds Most Wanted,"Lower Decks is way better overall than Picard. I liked all season 1 episodes, except for the last 2, and I think we all know why."
Worlds Most Wanted,"This is the dream for me to. Get the people from Severance and Devs to work on the new look of the ships, move the series forward in time and so on. But it might be better if a Next Next Gen doesn't happen under those showrunners, they'd likely ruin it."
Worlds Most Wanted,"Seriously, for real. For anyone curious, just take a look at the amount of removed comments in their own thread: https://old.reddit.com/r/startrek/comments/wl15vf/strange_new_worlds_is_mostwatched_paramount_star/

Not allowed to criticize DSC or Picard. Fuck that sub."
Worlds Most Wanted,"Oh please, it's a fucking circle jerk.  Just like the Netflix hate"
Worlds Most Wanted,"> As Paramount+'s subscriber base continues to grow

it also looks like Paramount will be content to let Trek streaming deals with legacy streaming services (Netflix, Prime Video, Hulu etc) expire. eventually P+ will have the Trek shows as exclusive content. which will probably also grow their subscriber base"
Worlds Most Wanted,Ok. But why would their numbers be going up? I picked up paramount again simply because I wanted to check out SNW.
Worlds Most Wanted,"Also since they say Paramount+ specifically, that may exclude CBS All Access and that's where Discovery and Picard first seasons were. So it's a pretty meaningless statement since this is the first ST live-action show to have a first season. We only know it beats the animated ones which isn't exactly a big thing. 

I love SNW and I'm happy it's successful but be careful how they turn what they say, that's the trap with the fact we get no outside party controlling ratings on streaming.

It's like Netflix and their ""2 minutes=a watch"" from before. At least the new ""total hours watched"" is a lot better (since you can find the numbers of viewers from the runtime though considering everyone has watched the entire season)"
Worlds Most Wanted,"What actually got me into Star Trek was my love of Futurama.

It's just my enjoyable comfort show I can watch on repeat.

Learning so much of it was based on Star Trek, I watched the original series, Next Generation, and movies. (Haven't explored beyond that) Except Picard and now SNW.

Picard season 2 was the worst Star Trek thing I've seen... maybe my expectations with Q were just too high.

Strange New Worlds may be my favorite. It's like the original series, brought into the 21st century of television making.

But it all started with Futurama and finding the connections as I watched the different series."
Worlds Most Wanted,"I did four episodes of Strange New World I am floored by the positive response it has gotten. I found it so cringy and terrible. 

I have not loved or enjoyed any Star Trek show since STNG. 

I agree with you, I just don't enjoy Star Trek."
Worlds Most Wanted,Paramount+ is simply a pretty small service so their shows stay a little under the radar for most people. Star Trek has the advantage of the franchise name to get more attention
Worlds Most Wanted,We’ll it auto plays after any Star Trek so if you aren’t paying close attention then you wind up watching it.
Worlds Most Wanted,"but Sisko had a Shaft beard in later seasons, that oughta count for something"
Mystery Lab,When something that could be solved just by sharing the information to others is a season long plotpoint.
Mystery Lab,"Bad theme song. Low effort opening credits.

The only exception I have come across so far is Star Trek Enterprise. Decent show, horrendous theme song. I’m guessing one of the producers had a hard on for the theme because they doubled down in later seasons by jazzing it up."
Mystery Lab,"When a show relies on shocking and sudden character deaths, but it doesn't really affect the story or the other characters. A good character death can be beautifully set up and feel like the logical conclusion to that character. It also has lasting ramifications. Sometimes though, it feels like writers just want to grab your attention with a sudden death but once that initial shock wears off there isn't much there story wise. 

The Walking Dead is a good example. You almost were guaranteed a mid-season finale side character death from someone not a part of the main cast. Followed by a season finale death from a major character. But the deaths just never felt like they had much weight to them."
Mystery Lab,"If a show is cancelled, then brought back after xx years with new episodes, I never watch it. The resurrected series is always a bad zombie version of the show I liked."
Mystery Lab,A montage backed by bad music. If you can’t come up with dialogue for an hour show you should quit.
Mystery Lab,"When something the show was building up is immediately reversed or is otherwise inconsequential.

Billy Butcher reuniting with his wife in the Boys Season 2 is one such example. The whole of season 1 kind of builds up to this. And then as soon as it happens, it is reversed and the story remains the same.

Of course, The Boys hasn't turned to ""crap"" just yet, but it's a red flag imo.

Another example is Jon Snow's heritage being revealed to the characters in later GOT, but nothing, no consequences or interesting dialogue comes of it."
Mystery Lab,I just wanna say Lost actually answers the vast majority of its questions. The issue was fans not *liking* the answers.
Mystery Lab,What's worse than #1 is when a show keeps ADDING a mystery - and it's usually more crazy than the first.  (keep watching our show plz!)
Mystery Lab,Sex in the first 5 minutes. Almost always a lame attempt to get attention for a show that doesn't have much else going on.
Mystery Lab,A bad laugh track
Mystery Lab,Too much music drowning out the dialogue
Mystery Lab,">This is how I know a show is going to be a 'mystery box' show, where they pile on the mysteries and you know they aren't going to be able to reasonably answer them. Like Lost ended up being.

I would argue this can work sometimes. The Leftovers for example."
Mystery Lab,"For me its when shows are a bit to heavy on the foreshadowing. Its usually a sign that the writers think their twists are cleverer than they actually are.

Granted having said that I try to get through at least three episodes of a show if it seems okay, generally the writers and the actors need a bit of time to find their footing."
Mystery Lab,"Family drama coming out of absolutely nowhere in the middle of or even before setting up a high concept premise. Example- La brea going full divorce melodrama moments before a giant time spanning sinkhole opens up in the ground. Arrow going ""oh no, the mother REMARRIED"" before getting to the whole vigilante thing"
Mystery Lab,"Introducing a group/community of new characters and lazily establishing how quirky and unique each character is by introducing them in a fast-paced environment in which they each overly epitomize their personalities with irreverent quipping back and forth, usually through the eyes of a main character who's unfamiliar with this group. 

Almost always a sign of contrived, shallow characters and writing."
Mystery Lab,"Probably mentioned but when male character being immediately respected by other men while also showing that those other men are not very smart, very cartoonish and naive. And they present it like look! This character is so cool even this group of people LOVE him! (Example: prisoners, criminals, people ""difficult"" to please)
Just why? Makes me feel creepy as if I have to watch some stranger's wet fantasy."
Mystery Lab,"> Every character is very conventionally attractive

You’re describing all tv. How can you watch any shows if you stop watching shows where the primary cast is conventionally attractive?"
Mystery Lab,Adults not acting like adults  Kid/teens smarter than the adults/cops
Mystery Lab,"Show that tries way too hard to be progressive when all of the characters are unlikeable scumbags. 

Case in point, I remember there was a monologue from the Netflix show Ginny and Georgia where the main female character said to the male teacher that all of the books that she had to read were written by straight white men, with one written by a woman and black person for tokenism. Way too forced and not at all natural. All of the characters were horrible people as well."
Mystery Lab,In media res intros because it indicates they care more about plot than character.
Mystery Lab,"""New ITV drama starring Martin Clunes."""
Mystery Lab,"Sound.  If the sound is off.  Like doors slamming too loudly, or too quiet dialog.  Also if they use over saturated effects, creeky car door, water drop, gun cocking, etc...  Usually that is where I drop a show pretty fast."
Mystery Lab,They did a show with all  redflags possible: LaBrea.
Mystery Lab,"Way too much cursing/bad cursing. 

I recently rewatched the first few episodes of Suits and I remembered just how fantastic that show was. Eventually though, in the later seasons, every single sentence there was a ""God damn"" or ""shit"" injected into it where it clearly didn't belong. 

I don't like broadcast tv shows because there's clearly situations when a character should be cursing and they don't (SoA is a great example of this on FX even though great show), but now that censorship has kind of dwindled, writers are using them as a crutch. 

If I hear just an abysmal amount of cursing where it doesn't belong, it's a big time red flag that the writers suck and don't know how to write good dialogue."
Mystery Lab,"Unnecessary breaking off into a song and/or dance routine. It makes the story unrealistic and to me it indicates that the writers are running out of ideas.

One exception that I have to mention is Mrs Maisel. There all the singing and dancing is nicely incorporated into the scenario."
Mystery Lab,"When its too focused on 1-2 characters, or only has 1-2 intresting characters but at the same time is meant to be a serie about those characters in a thriller or action setting. For that reason i think breaking bad is meh, you knew that nothing would happend to walter or  jesse. But sopranos is great. You knew that nothing would happend to tony. But you had no idea what would happend to sil, christopher, paulie, pussy, junior, livia etc etc"
Mystery Lab,"My red flag's a negative one: if a couple flesh-and-blood people don't tell me that I should try something, I just don't bother."
Mystery Lab,Teens using stupid slang that middle aged people think cool kids say.
Mystery Lab,"Establishing Shots.  They’re not necessary as a rule, but are frequently cut because they’re expensive and require skill to make look good.  If an entire episode has no establishing shots your into some thrown together POS."
Mystery Lab,Back to back to back time jumps in the cold open 🚩
Mystery Lab,The usage of a fake baby in Dear Christmas made me cry from laughing. That's not even budget that is straight lazy someone using TikTok would do not a production movie. It actually makes the movie funny as you look for more obscure things.
Mystery Lab,If plot points or characters' views sound like something you'd read in an average Redditor's post.
Mystery Lab,"When the entire cast is made of beautiful people. Biggest red flag.


*Haha, I just took some time reading OP's full post. Well, agreed*"
Mystery Lab,"If it's made by Netflix and the main characters are high school students. Or, maybe just if it's made by Netflix."
Mystery Lab,shoe horning every check list item in order to be diverse and safe.
Mystery Lab,It’s a streaming service original. Guaranteed to be written by algorithm.
Mystery Lab,"If someone joins people talking and gives a perfectly timed comment/answer.

If the protagonists solve problems too easily instead struggling with seemingly small things. 

People giving speeches before dying instead of getting to safety.

Overselling jokes, meaning instead of being a bit subtle it's a sledgehammer. 

Obvious continuity errors based on lazy writing. 

Time travel. It just never works because even the best writers or great shows like Dark produce an endless stream of continuity errors."
Mystery Lab,Too much CGI and no story to grip/entice and keep me watching. Thinking of two recent releases in particular 🙄🙄🙄
Mystery Lab,"I think when you see that it’s 10 episodes long and each ep is like an hour. It ain’t gonna be a slick, well told tale if they need 10 hours to tell it."
Mystery Lab,"Usually when there’s a cast of complete unknowns. I like giving things a chance but the moment I find out there’s no one I know in the series it usually means the project couldn’t attract any real talent

There are odd exceptions of course"
Mystery Lab,"If I watch an episode that introduces an A plot at the start, wraps it up at the end, and the next episode opens with a near identical A plot."
Mystery Lab,"When we hear main character's POV and they sigh a lot during it. They're painfully relatable but also oh look at me I'm kind of like any person you know, i drink water and reflect a lot. Just seems lazy writing."
Mystery Lab,">...2. Every character is very conventionally attractive.

>CW shows do this a lot. If every character is not just attractive, but made-in-a-lab, ideal facial features attractive, I know the show isn't going to be worth my time.

Indeed, may I present Exhibit A, Tom Swift?

Mystery Lab,"\- Bad acting, non the ""Georges Lucas is a bad director, even good actors look bad bc of it""' level, the ""my acting perf is so bad, it affects my fellow co-actors too and the prod is forced to cut my screentime"" level. When the acting of the main or some of the main characs is so bad, it deters every attempt to immerse yourself in the story.

\- no chemistry between members of the main cast.

\- when some of the main protagonist's idiosyncracies are so odd, it hurts the story or its depiction. Like in the Good wife, when Margulies was feuding one of her co-stars and all their scenes together were manufactured. Same thing with an actress who is so small, that all her non solo scenes are either them sitting on chair or really weird shot angles."
Mystery Lab,"If a show has a story that was clearly written to only be one season long (the entire first season's plot has a beginning, middle and end) but the show is massively popular, 90% of the time the 2nd if not subsequent seasons are crap. 

It feels obvious the writer don't have a real desire to continue this story but production is forcing them to make more money off the show. Sometimes the writer will even flat-out refuse so they just hire different writers which often makes things even worse.

See: Under the Dome. or when the whole plot goes from government or mafia organisation being the vilains, to body-snatching aliens all of a sudden."
Mystery Lab,"This isn't something usually obvious from the start but something that turns me off fantasy TV shows in the middle if not well-written is when it's very obvious the love between the male and female lead (""which they haven't realized yet"") is somehow magically going to save the world"

Mystery Lab,"When a character is so upset they go ""No! I don't want to hear it!"" and that will be the basis for the plot going forward."
Mystery Lab,"All of *Umbrella Academy*? And I love that show, too."
Mystery Lab,"Its been a long road....

Seriously though it grew on me by season 3 and then BAM they redid the song and the 2nd version is even worse. The outro theme for the credits was such a better option but oh well."
Mystery Lab,"I mostly agree, but The 100 is a really good example of writers doing this in a good way to show just how fucked up everything is."
Mystery Lab,"Which is pretty in line with the comics, although, they definitely had a bit where it was straight up some named character previous introduced dies every issue."
Mystery Lab,Law and Order would like a word with you.
Mystery Lab,I recently got around to watching Arrested Development's 4th and 5th season from netflix. From what I understand it wasn't well received but I thought it was very much in the original spirit and still hilarious. Wish there was a season 6.
Mystery Lab,Samurai Jack did pretty well for itself.
Mystery Lab,Except for Twin Peaks
Mystery Lab,The Orville came back as a much better show than it was before.

Mystery Lab,[30 Rock killing it again.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6V0FLIxaao)
Mystery Lab,"Yeah, I got that with Empire. The dad was diagnosed with a terminal disease in the pilot, it's his whole motivation for everything he does. Then in like episode 11 it's in remission. Next episode he's sent to jail. 2 episodes later? Out of jail. OK so this is clearly a show where nothing actually matters lol"
Mystery Lab,I disagree with the boys. Becca's reveal and the fact that she has a kid turned the entire story on it's head. It's no longer Butcher must kill homelander as the core of his story and his motivation it's now he has to protect Ryan from Homelander. She made him promise and gave him his new motivation. Her presence introduced Ryan and the fight over who controls Ryan seems to be the most important plot point of the show. Her character is why Butcher even cares about Ryan. She added a lot to the show and she changed the status quo significantly. Without her it's just butcher vs homelander and his son instead of butcher and homelander fighting over who raises Ryan.
Mystery Lab,"A big factor is viewership declining. Lost's season 6 ratings were about half of season 2's (20 million vs 10 million). So yes, while it may have answered questions, those answers didn't reach half the people that were familiar with the show from earlier seasons. 

Basically, Lost didn't answer a lot of questions by the time a lot of viewers started checking out"
Mystery Lab,"A lot of those resolutions felt underdeveloped, like they were completing a checklist. Season 6 in general was overstuffed with content so some storylines didn't get the focus they deserved."
Mystery Lab,Unworthy payoff to a setup is pretty much just as bad as no payoff at all
Mystery Lab,The numbers?  Or the 4 toed statue?
Mystery Lab,">S01E01 3:45 in.

Mystery Lab,I was put off Ash vs Evil Dead because of this very reason but it ended up being a personal all timer so I guess it depends.
Mystery Lab,I don't know what you're talking about; Banshee is an incredible show.
Mystery Lab,"One of my favorite recent shows (Trying on Apple TV+) has a sex scene in the first five minutes. It nearly made me switch off the show, but I skipped through and the rest of it a) was amazing and b) had zero sex scenes. It was just that one in the beginning for some reason. I have no clue what they were thinking with that one."
Mystery Lab,"this one def has a lot of caveats, also because there are so many ways to undercut this immediately when the sex is over"
Mystery Lab,Gotta spell out the plot with cheap background music since the writing and acting are so poor.
Mystery Lab,The leftovers was never going to explain it’s central mystery and focused on the smaller ones. I liked how seasons two uses let the mustery be as it’s theme song.
Mystery Lab,"It managed to use the mystery as the backdrop to the whole show, so it kind of solved that problem by using the lack of closure as a theme."
Mystery Lab,I think the leftovers is a special case as a lot of Lindeloff's inspiration came from how people reacted to the end of lost.
Mystery Lab,"One show like this that I'm curious how it's going to go is Severance. S1 was a lot of fun but I finished it with the feeling that they'd bitten off a bit more than they could chew with the mysteries (the thing with Mark's wife especially was what made me go ""oh wait hang on...""). I'm curious as to whether it will be one of the good ones or one of the bad ones."
Mystery Lab,"This is usually one for me, but breaking bad season 1 had loads of these"
Mystery Lab,"What's a show example of this, you'd say? (Just curious)"
Mystery Lab,Just watch non-American (and non-Danish) shows.
Mystery Lab,"House of the Dargon isn't like that. Game of Thrones wasn't either. Neither were The Wire or The Sopranos. I see a pattern.

To expand the pattern. Breaking Bad, Better Call Saul, and Seinfeld didn't either."
Mystery Lab,Not really that’s mainly just cw
Mystery Lab,"No I'm not.  I said conventionally attractive, you're getting hung up on the word attractive."
Mystery Lab,The 100 had some ugly people in it.
Mystery Lab,Skins.
Mystery Lab,Oh yeah when the foley work is silly as hell
Mystery Lab,"For the most part I agree with you, but there are definite exceptions.  This turned me off to Deadwood when I happened to catch an episode with my dad as it first aired.  Bugged the hell out of me how every other word was 'cocksucker', just felt like it was trying to be edgy.

I gave it another chance last year, and jesus is it amazing.  Binged the whole thing, couldn't stop!"
Mystery Lab,"Especially if all the characters talk the same way and you realize they have nothing to say. ""I say we fuck those fuckers!"" ""Yeah, fuck them!"" ""Fuck yeah!"" Pretty much tells you all you need to know about the writing upfront."
Mystery Lab,The cursing in Suits was hilarious after a while
Mystery Lab,"like if no one yk IRL recommends it, you simply dont start it at all? ever?"
Mystery Lab,Interesting. Can you list any examples? although I imagine that might be difficult
Mystery Lab,As opposed to what the broadcast channels sprayfart out?
Mystery Lab,"Dark, Severance, Stranger Things, Narcos, Narcos Mexico, BoJack Horseman, F is for Family, The Exoanse, Arcane, The Bear, and many more are TV shows that range from decent to all time greats and definitely do not feel as if they were written by an algorithm."
Mystery Lab,yeah cause network TV is crazy unique lmao
Mystery Lab,">If someone joins people talking and gives a perfectly timed comment/answer.

Wow, you just conjured a lot of bad ""stop the disaster"" shows for me I bailed on because of scenes like that. 

""There are asteroids headed toward the Earth."" ""And all our defense screens are down for maintenance."" ""And the maintenance workers are on strike."" 

\>>In walks attractive man/woman in sexy suit with smug expression who shouts: ""The answer, my friends, is The UltraBizillion GazMorbius Project!"" That's when I give up."

Mystery Lab,I feel like Westworld qualifies for this one.  First season was perfect. Everything else was hot trash and a complete mess
Immigration Nation,"TV was cheaper, they had less time to prep, they pumped out 20+ episodes a year. It was more disposable and less lucrative for the actors. All that means it's going to be viewed as lesser."
Immigration Nation,[deleted]
Immigration Nation,"I’m not going to read all that, but the primary reason tv work once hindered an actor’s ability to work in movies is that tv requires the actor working specifically on that job for 8-9 months. That’s still the case for regulars in these high budget fantasy shows. It’s kind of hard to get into movies when you’ve got 2-3 months available to shoot and films take anywhere between 2-6 months to shoot on average."
Immigration Nation,"I’m not going to read your whole post, because you wrote an essay instead of asking a question, but here you go:

Tom Hanks was a television star, even though the show he had a lead role in only lasted two seasons.

Bruce Willis was a massive television star.

Michael J. Fox was a television star.

There were a bunch of television stars who made the jump to movies because when movies were star driven, the money in movies was much better.

The people who stayed in television had no movie star power, which back then was defined by the ability to get people in the theatre in the first extended weekend.

So the answer is simple, many television stars became movie stars, and did not go back to television because back then, movies paid better."
Immigration Nation,"As a rule, the US didn't just treat TV acting as lesser, but the whole medium of television. It's kind of what Newton T. Minow was getting at with *Television and the Public Interest*; he had the belief that television had the *potential* to be brilliant, but that it was rarely exercised in the US, particularly after the death of the television play.

Meanwhile, as mentioned in one of the replies in your original post, in places with less commercial pressure, television could and often was treated with more seriousness and respect. For example, in the UK, the television play format persisted well into the 1980s, with some pretty big names involved such as Ken Loach, Dennis Potter, Nigel Kneale and Noël Coward, but US audiences of the time might have found a formula where they were adapting scripts by Jean-Paul Sartre to be a bit stuffy.

Further afield, other European countries gave a certain amount of credence to highbrow directing on television; Germany had Rainer Werner Fassbinder with *Berlin Alexanderplatz*, Poland had Krzysztof Kieślowski with *Dekalog* and Sweden had Ingmar Bergman with, among others, *Scenes from a Marriage* and *Fanny and Alexander*. As a result, I get the impression that there would have been less of a stigma around transitioning from television acting to the big screen.

I kind of feel that the perspective that *The Sopranos* invented quality television comes with a certain amount of cultural myopia when other countries were straight-up putting art cinema in a television form onto their screens, but it did have a big enough budget that it was hard to ignore. That said, one could assert that David Lynch was there first from a US perspective, transitioning from an already pretty notable cinematic directorial career into television."
Immigration Nation,Times change.
Immigration Nation,"The movies traditionally held higher prestige. But around the year 2000 CGI was just getting cheap and easy enough that it could be in any movie. That's why the era of superhero movies began around that time. Once CGI got cheap and easy, we were inevitably going to be given lazy movies about people with superpowers that took the form of CGI. We've always had lazy movies, but ubiquitous CGI shifted the balance. 

So cinema got shallower, lost its prestige, and lost its status as being above television. Television filled the vacuum of substantive storytelling."
Immigration Nation,"In the US. When you sign up for a show you sign up for 7 seasons of a show. Because the TV studios own you for this period of time, it can definitely effect the career of a rising star or a movie star would be reluctant to go back to being shackled to a such a long contract.

Michael J Fox is one such example, the producers wanted him but they couldn’t get him because he was contractually obligated to Family Ties. It wasn’t until later they could get him. 

Pierce Bronson was offered Dalton’s James Bond but also couldn’t take the role because he was on Remington Steele at the time.

Even with these limitations there are a plenty of people that went on the great success after being on TV back in the 80s. 

Will Smith is probably the biggest example of someone that got super star fame and awards. 

The difference you are seeing now is that an actor can go to television and back because the contracts of many cable or streaming series doesn’t require the massive 7 year contracts that are required of older network shows."

***The most of the people on the Great Plains of North America with German heritage had ancestors who emigrated from the Russian Empire, and not modern-day Germany.*** The Canadian Encyclopedia states simply: ""Canada's main source of Germans was Russia — especially from the Volga, the Black Sea coast and Volhynia.""\[16\] The Encyclopedia of the Great Plains says that ***""\[b\]etween 1873 and 1914 approximately 115,000 German Russians immigrated to the United States and about 150,000 to western Canada""*** and ""it is estimated\[...\] that by 1910 approximately 44 percent of all German settlers in western Canada were Germans from Russia"".\[17\]"
Immigration Nation,Sound like a question for Taylor Sheridan
Immigration Nation,I want to check this out now but apparently it's only on Paramount+? :(
Immigration Nation,For some resaon when I saw 1883 my mind jumped to 1899. The word German in the title didn't help.
Immigration Nation,"Maybe its a confusion of Prussia and Russia in some phase of the development, Germans in Russia would probably speak German otherwise why would they be called German at all. I've never heard of Russians on German soil, maybe some other Slavic speakers though."
Immigration Nation,"1872 - The century-old privileges granted to German farmers settled in Russia were revoked by the Tsarist government, causing thousands of the farmers to emigrate. By 1920, there were well over 100,000 of these so-called Volga and Black Sea Germans in the United States, with the greatest numbers in the Dakotas, Nebraska, and Colorado. Black Sea Germans soon became known for their skill as wheat farmers. In 1990 an estimated one million descendants of these Russian Germans lived in America.

Immigration Nation,Google a map of Germany in 1880's you can see why
Immigration Nation,"That really makes sense.

""Germany"" didn't exist until 1871 and it grew out of Prussia. One of Hitler's ""justifications"" for WWII is how so much of Eastern Europe belongs to Germany. 

There is this misunderstanding that there are numerous European Countries that predate the US. When you start thinking about the definition of a country and take a look at history you will find that pretty much none of them do. 

What is Germany today started in 1990.  

What was Russia in the 1800s is radically different than the USSR and that is radically different from the mobster run dictatorship that is modern day Russia.

Even France who carried the US through the US revolution is now a radically different country.

Finally borders in Europe, particularly in Eastern Europe are nothing but lines on map that are used for Tax purposes."
Immigration Nation,My dad's grandparents were German and Russian speaking Germans by way of Konigsberg and Berlin. Baltic states had a fair bit of German and Russian speaking people.  Prussian empire was pretty big.
Immigration Nation,"Some of them speaks Polish also (sick girl near river in episode 2 for example). In background we can hear Russian also, some German dialect and Polish. 

Josef states that they are know how to farm in mountains because come from european mountain area. In Russian-Germans are lived mostly in Volga river and there is no mountains in the near. If they are from modern day Germany (there is lots of mountains in southern part) then way they speak Russian? Polish speaking ""Germans"" lived in flat area (Wielkopolska) in XIX century.

Also they treated immigrants like total idiots, for example when you see drinking water from the river, unable ride horses or wagons. Most of them are from villages and belive me in european villages horses and wagon are common view in XIXc. 

Swimming ban is laughtable also."
Immigration Nation,"I took Russian years ago in college and noticed the exact same thing - those characters were definitely speaking Russian (or a very similar Slavic language), not German.  Can't hardly remember to understand or speak it, but I definitely remember what it *sounds* like. I just assumed the subtitles guy or somebody else screwed up.  I enjoy the show a lot but there are historical and cultural details that seem suspect to me."
Immigration Nation,"I'm pretty the immigrants on the show are Scandinavian, Norwegian if I'm not mistaken. Maybe the two languages sound similar."
Immigration Nation,God that was bothering me too cuz i speak russian as well. Thanks for asking that.
Immigration Nation,"Some speak German, others a Slavic language. Might be from Prusssia where some spoke Polish? The show says they came on the same boat but don’t know each other so they don’t need to all speak the same language. One woman is described as a Gypsy"
Immigration Nation,"That's a pretty dumb oversight lmao. Not impossible, sure, but the two languages sound nothing alike."
Immigration Nation,Well that’s a bit of history I didn’t know. Thanks for shedding some light on my question!
Immigration Nation,"My family were German by way of Russia but they spoke German. I suppose it is possible they also spoke Russian when they arrived but among themselves they spoke German. 

There would have been no reason or incentive for them to ever speak a word of Russian again, if they had ever bothered to learn it in Russia, which is unlikely. They weren’t among Russians, they were given their own German towns inside the borders of Russia which was pretty big. 

They spoke German so much that their town in the US had a German language newspaper through WW2. 

My great grandparents barely knew a word of English. 

All that to say I think there was some kind of mixup on the show."
Immigration Nation,"German colonists in Europe were very insular and while some would have known Russian, they certainly wouldn't have been speaking it at home. Carpathian Germans settled in what is present day Slovakia in the 14th century and the communities they settled were still speaking German scores of generations later, until they were forcibly removed after the 2nd world War. Volga Germans would not have spoken Russian amongst themselves, so it's wild to me that they included it in this show. To me, it sound like they're speaking Polish, especially in the 1st episode. I wonder if the show runners will ever mention it."
Immigration Nation,That is where my Dad's side of the family is from.  They ended up in Eastern Washington.  Difference is they spoke German.
Immigration Nation,Good point… I suppose I can try him on Twitter.
Immigration Nation,"Yep, looks like that’s the case.That’s a bit of history I wasn’t aware of. Thanks for sharing."

Immigration Nation,"Even on streaming services like Netflix there are a lot of typos and other mistakes on subtitles, I don’t think they pay transcribers much."
Immigration Nation,"Nah, completely possible. Some of the stuff that's supposedly german is hardly comprehensible although the Joseph actor is german and speaks it natively. 

I still remember a scene in The Shield where some guy calls to his german shepherd ""Fass!"" (german for ""Bite"" when said to dogs) and the subtitles says ""[spanish]"" as the speaker is a mexican."
Immigration Nation,It is interesting history but doesn't explain why the subtitles identify the wrong language >_>
Immigration Nation,You're right. I checked and they are Germans. I guess I wasn't paying attention that closely.
Immigration Nation,That’s true.

Immigration Nation,"So, I guess their goal today was to take everyone who said D+ had no original content besides The Mandalorian, and pretty much punch them in the face repeatedly."
Immigration Nation,Hooch is crazy
Immigration Nation,/u/arashtp you missed Percy Jackson.
Immigration Nation,"Nothing on any of the ""old"" Netflix series has me sad...  Nice write up, though."
Immigration Nation,I thought this was wallstreebets DD for a second lol
Immigration Nation,Super stoked on most of this. I’m especially looking forward to the Nat geo content. Can you imagine if Disney+ dropped with half of these titles? Game changer
Immigration Nation,"So strange to realize Ice Age is owned by Disney now. 

Also I’m sort of unexpectedly excited about the continuation of Mighty Ducks!"
Immigration Nation,"Based on the release timelines of those shows, it looks like their strategy is: 

Zeitgeist show for 6 weeks -> 1 week of cool down —> couple weeks of hype up -> next Zeitgeist show -> Repeat"
Immigration Nation,They're really going all out with the High Republic.
Immigration Nation,did She Hulk get a trailer or anything?
Immigration Nation,that's a lot of content
Immigration Nation,A Turner and Hooch reboot yyyeeeeessss!!! I've been a fan (we call ourselves Hoochers) for years and am flipping out right now!!!!
Immigration Nation,Missing rogue squadron on Star Wars
Immigration Nation,Hocus Pocus 2. What.
Immigration Nation,"A lot of this is awesome, but can I just take a moment to appreciate *Sister Act 3*?"
Immigration Nation,">Tiana is the first princess to have her own Walt Disney Animation Studios series

Just going to ignore the Little Mermaid and Tangled series apparently."
Immigration Nation,[deleted]
Immigration Nation,I have only read a hand full of moon knight comics but from what I have heard and read making a PG moon knight show is not going to go over well with fans.
Immigration Nation,Any specific dates to go with this?
Immigration Nation,You forgot the multiple tongue in cheek references to Matt Murdock.  Charlie Cox's Daredevil is officially part of the MCU now.  Hes apparently in She Hulk and Spider-Man 3.
Immigration Nation,"Damn, the Ducks end up becoming what they rebelled against..."
Immigration Nation,"As a bi dude I'm still waiting for literally anything big that features a non-straight dude. In film they ignored it almost completely out of fear of gay-hating countries banning it and them losing money (like China). 

Really hoping for something to come through, maybe with x-men back in the fold Iceman could get something"
Immigration Nation,So is Ahsoka taking the place of the Rebels spinoff? Because thats what I was most excited for
Immigration Nation,Disney is milking Star Wars and Marvel for everything dollar they can squeeze. There are way too many reboots and remakes. They need originally sourced content that has no reliance on existing IP. How about some original NON-Marvel/Star Wars scripted content? I think the Mandalorian is a cute show but I want to see ORIGINAL content for once. This slate of shows are not enough to keep all of their subscribers satisfied.
Immigration Nation,Seems like Star Wars's future is on TV.
Immigration Nation,Is it weird that I'm most excited for the Josh Peck version of Turner and Hooch?
Immigration Nation,"Looks like they're updating Microcosmos with A Real Bug's Life, that should be cool as fuck."
Immigration Nation,">The Mighty Ducks: Game Changers

>Lauren Graham (Gilmore Girls, Parenthood) and Emilio Estevez (reprising his role from the original feature films) star in the next chapter of the hit Mighty Ducks franchise, premiering in early 2021. In present day Minnesota, the Mighty Ducks have evolved from scrappy underdogs to an ultra-competitive, powerhouse youth hockey team. After 12-year-old Evan is unceremoniously cut from the Ducks, he and his mom Alex set out to build their own ragtag team of misfits to challenge the cutthroat, win-at-all-costs culture of competitive youth sports.

I hope Disney has been paying attn to Cobra Kai and takes all the good from it and applies it to the Ducks!!!"
Immigration Nation,"Man, Tony Stark cannot keep control of his tech, can he? Well, I guess he's dead, so that makes sense."
Immigration Nation,The one thing I want from Marvel is an OG Nick Fury and the Howling Commandos show.
Immigration Nation,They forgot Shadow Hunters.
Immigration Nation,I just want to have the spin off Thrawn and Ezra travels in space show.
Immigration Nation,so much content that post alone made me vomit .
Immigration Nation,"Hey, bozo, why didn't you mention It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia?

Great list, otherwise."
Immigration Nation,Thanks man you're awesome
Immigration Nation,[Rogue squadron](https://youtu.be/5bLkTjn6Y_s)
Immigration Nation,Disney+ launch was more like beta test to ensure their decision of allocating such resources to the platform
Immigration Nation,"The criticism was regarding lack of original screenplays, too. It's still true in that aspect."
Immigration Nation,"It's still lacks diversity, it's still marvel, star wars and Pixar animated pg-13 movies, still no new new IPs."
Immigration Nation,[deleted]
Immigration Nation,"If they don't have Phill Lewis playing the dog using mocap, they dun goofed."
Immigration Nation,*holds up lighter*
Immigration Nation,And Swiss Family Robinson.
Immigration Nation,"Just hints at Daredevil, from Sony in Spider-Man 3 and at the reveal here today for She-Hulk."
Immigration Nation,"Yeah sounds like the Multiverse in SM3 will pull in Daredevil and Kingpin. Which could be great.

Daredevil was hinted at strongly for SheHulk, and there have been rumors that DNofrio has campaigned hard and they’ve taken him seriously as maybe using his character to put together the Sinister Six."
Immigration Nation,"There's a big hint in Hawkeye. Maya Lopez is a definitively Daredevil character (Echo, a deaf woman who can see something once and imitate it originally hired by Kingpin to take out Daredevil and eventually befriending him). She also wore the Ronin outfit for awhile that Hawkeye wore in Endgame after his family vanished (New Avengers comics).

Edit: why am I being downvoted for this?"
Immigration Nation,Not enough 🚀🚀🚀
Immigration Nation,It’s pretty genius
Immigration Nation,Super into the Acolyte as I’d really like to see what the Sith/dark side users were up to during this time period
Immigration Nation,"No, but they confirmed Tatiana Maslany."
Immigration Nation,Tim Roth will be back as Abomination and Mark Ruffalo.
Immigration Nation,Its a rather deceptive line if your not in the know.  WDAS is the movie studio. Disney Television Animation is the studio that typically handles the TV side (they were the ones that made the Tangled series).
Immigration Nation,That's not necessarily a bad thing tbh. It's how they execute it that matters. GOTG was kinda considered a bottom of the barrel IP for marvel before they made it and it turned out well.
Immigration Nation,"There’s like 70 announced shows here and less than 10 are actual original ideas. Really disappointing *in my opinion*.

I get people like Star Wars and stuff, but it seems extreme to me."
Immigration Nation,"I think it could be done. For me at least the fun part is the mind-bendy unreliable narrator stuff and not the graphic violence. Although there is something to be said for when other characters meet Moon Knight and are like, ""oh this guy is *crazy* crazy and not just *Batman* crazy."""
Immigration Nation,"This didn’t mention any of the Marvel movies since it’s still not certain whether they’ll be released in theaters first or on Disney+ at the same time, but The Eternals is set to have their first openly gay main character whenever that’s released.

If you haven’t watched the Disney+ short film Out, you absolutely should."
Immigration Nation,"Young Avengers is just over the horizon, and that comes with the most prominent gay couple in marvel. Still a few years out though."
Immigration Nation,Not sure if it is 100% confirmed but I remember seeing somewhere that Valkyrie is looking for a wife in the next Thor movie.
Skam France,[deleted]
Skam France,"Great write up!


I'm not familiar with most of these, and I watch a shit-ton of TV and movies. I really like the effort, and the writeups are perfect in length.


Again, not knowing these a lot, is Severance the highest ranked English speaking show? (Nothing against non English speakers of course) 


Also, I'm guessing most of these are straight drama? Language and genre might both be useful things to put in parenthesis for anyone else unfamiliar.


Totally agree with the couple from White Lotus being great characters, I much preferred season 1 (which seems like a hot take) but those two, specifically the woman, were very interesting characters to me."
Skam France,"How you pick what to watch? I’m overwhelmed with all these shows in Netflix and I always seem to pick the limited series or those talked about in reddit, especially regarding to the foreign shows or K dramas. There isn’t much write-ups or reviews in English."
Skam France,I am glad and surprised Prisma is number one. Well deserved
Skam France,"This is Going to Hurt: I'm a medical student and I thought I'd seen every medical show but this one is on my list now! I've heard that this show shows the reality of a doctor's life without all the glamor of medicine.  
  
This show compared to other medical shows what do you think and what other medical shows have you watched I'm curious!"
Skam France,"Insanely odd for the 2 anime to show up to be an average romcom (with crazy production value) and a good but lesser known sequel.

(Oh NVM I thought this was a list from some website not yours! Still surprised to see MDUD though!)"
Skam France,"""hidden gems of 2022 for me"" might be better title for this post.

i must admit some of these plots engaged my curiosity. im gonna look for them. rhanks for the list."

..................

I didn't like what 2022 television had to offer for the most part. One too many disappointments for me as well. I mean I watched a lot more shows than I did in 2021, yet struggled to find 25 new shows for this list. But I do think my top 13 here are genuinely great.But anyways, thanks a lot for reading, even if you just scrolled through this lol. Same time, same place, next year? ❤️"
Skam France,"Neat list.  A lot of shows I've not seen.

A few shows from 2022 I'd recommend if you haven't seen em:

- Black Bird

- SAS Rogue Heroes

- The Offer

- Under the Banner of Heaven"
Skam France,Recency bias but I just finished Yellowjackets and really had a great time watching it.
Skam France,No Atlanta? Both seasons last year were incredible
Skam France,Pachinko is the most slept on series of 2022
Skam France,"1. She hulk
2. Ted lasso
3. Ms Marvel
4. Harley Quinn show
5. Lord of the rings
6. Spy x family 
7. Chainsaw man
8. Loki
9. Mob psycho
10. Hot D"
Skam France,Which ones did you see? 🤔 amma take a wild guess and say The Bear and Severance?
Skam France,"> is Severance the highest ranked English speaking show?

Yes. Even though Pachinko got a bit of english too. 

> I'm guessing most of these are straight drama? Language and genre might both be useful things to put in parenthesis for anyone else unfamiliar.

Yea. And yea I should probably do that next time."
Skam France,"i just read the synopsis and glance at the preview a bit sometimes just to check visual/production quality. if it looks like something that could be potentially great, i check it out."
Skam France,🙂💕
Skam France,It’s great but it’s depressing.
Skam France,"What other new anime from 2022 did you think were great? 

Anime for me in 2022 was, *meh* tbh. I didn't like Summertime Rendering much and Chainsaw Man hasn't gotten to the good parts of the manga yet. I was suppose to see Bocchi The Rock! before making this list, but ended up getting an ear infection so couldn't."
Skam France,I'd count Yellowjackets as 2021 TV show.
Skam France,on the other version of this list pinned on my profile.
Skam France,"Nice! Do you often give the pilot a go before fully committed to the whole season? Any shows that you have given up midpoint? 


Like I tried to start Warrior Nun because the trailer seems fun and the lead actress looks very beautiful, also being afraid of it being cancelled (it indeed got cancelled then), but have given up after episode 6 or 7… cause the plot is very weak and the characters are laughable.


And then I tried to pick the ones that got high ratings in imdb, and started watching Extraordinary Attorney Woo and I do like it so far! Although sometimes being too cheesy at times, the acting is excellent and the stories are well-written. Highly recommended."
Skam France,"Dropped Summertime after 5 minutes lol.

But personally, Bocchi the Rock is incredible TV and is my #1 show of any medium this year. And I'm not even usually into anime comedies. It's just that good, glad you're gonna try it! I'm an Attack on Titan fan after the massive story shift in Season 3, and S4P2 aired at the start of the year, although personally I don't like rating something that isn't an entire season.

Otherwise Chainsaw Man would be a decent pick even if, as you said, it hasn't quite gotten to what makes it special yet. Cyberpunk Edgerunners is one that would be worth watching and has near universal praise, and my other 2 shows to hit a 9 were Kaguya S3 (but it's not everyone), and Paripi Koumei, which I thought was an extremely passionate show but it might hit as a 7-8 for others. 

From your list I probably have to watch the 2 seasons of Tatami though. I had no idea it was well regarded I never looked into it!

Other than that though, yea there was a lot of meh. Spy Family went from potentially great to just average as it went on, LycoRyco got a lot of hype but was merely good not great (needed some writing cleanup). Personally though Dress up Darling was ok at best, and Gundam and To Your Eternity were massive disappointments"
Skam France,Ignoring some great sequels I thought Chainsaw man was awesome even if it hadn't gotten to some of the good parts  of the manga. And I really liked summertime rendering (although I haven't seen the last few episodes). Lycoris recoil was fun. Spy X Family was great.
Skam France,Oh my bad. I’m late to the party.
Skam France,"> Do you often give the pilot a go before fully committed to the whole season?

I give everything at least 4 episodes before I decided whether it's working for me or not. Unless it's *reeeeeeeaaaaally* bad... then I quit after the 2nd or 3rd. But that rarely happens. That has only happened like 4 times in the past 3 years. 

> Any shows that you have given up midpoint?

A shit ton. 

> Extraordinary Attorney

I was suppose to watch this show too but unfortunately didn't have time for it. There are some great shows coming out of korea nowadays (3 are on this list too lol), but they require commitment with those lengthy episode counts and runtime. 

I recommend ""**D.P.**"" on netflix too if you haven't seen it. That's another outstanding one."
Skam France,"> Bocchi the Rock is incredible TV and is my #1 show of any medium this year. And I'm not even usually into anime comedies. It's just that good

damn. guess i gotta hurry and check this one out now. lol."
Skam France,"You should check out Kotaro Lives Alone, such a good show!"
Skam France,"Heard good reviews about DP but I haven’t managed to watch it, with season 2 coming this year I may watch it soon!

For other Korean shows I watched My Name, Hellbound and of course Squid Game in 2021, which were all very good. Narco-Saints, The Glory and Somebody are shows I saved in 2022 but not started yet."
Skam France,I did hear about it! I'll add it to my list thanks!
Skam France,"Metalhead at number 9? I thought it was way worse than the others, but it's so cool to see someone's least favorite being someone else's favorite, goes to show how good Black Mirror is."

Skam France,Number 1 has got to be Chicanery from Better Call Saul. Nothing else came close.
Skam France,I just looked it up and it came to the us from the uk on January 5!
Skam France,The End Of The Fucking World was released in January 2018!
Skam France,"While I wouldn't personally place Metalhead that high on my year-end list, I'd say the episode has a lot going for it.  Black Mirror is always about how near-future tech can affect us. Those dogs are almost-functionally real in our current reality! Look up the Boston Dynamics robots if you haven't seen them already. Seeing current tech that can potentially lead to that kind of desolate world terrifies me. 

On top of that the episode is as well-produced as many other episodes of the franchise. The acting from the lead is believable. Cinematography went a long way in selling the idea: not just in its black-and-white bleakness but also in its framing of the power struggle. And the zinger of what their mission objective was  emphasized that cold reality."
Skam France,yea. it premiered on Channel 4 on October 24.
Skam France,"uhh fuck no it wasn't! it was released in October 2017. 

It's on my Top 25 TV Shows of 2017 list too go check that out on my profile."

Three Kingdoms,"Romance of the Three Kingdoms, attributed to Luo Guanzhong, is a historical novel set in the turbulent years towards the end of the Han dynasty and the Three Kingdoms period in Chinese history, starting in 169 and ending with the reunification of the land in 280.

The story – part historical, part legend, and part myth – romanticises and dramatises the lives of feudal lords and their retainers, who tried to replace the dwindling Han dynasty or restore it. While the novel follows hundreds of characters, the focus is mainly on the three power blocs that emerged from the remnants of the Han dynasty, and would eventually form the three states of Cao Wei, Shu Han, and Eastern Wu. The novel deals with the plots, personal and military battles, intrigues, and struggles of these states to achieve dominance for almost 100 years.

Romance of the Three Kingdoms is acclaimed as one of the Four Great Classical Novels of Chinese literature; it has a total of 800,000 words and nearly a thousand dramatic characters (mostly historical) in 120 chapters. The novel is among the most beloved works of literature in East Asia, and its literary influence in the region has been compared to that of the works of Shakespeare on English literature.[3] It is arguably the most widely read historical novel in late imperial and modern China.

**Three Kingdoms** is a Chinese television series based on the events in the late Eastern Han dynasty and the Three Kingdoms period. The plot is based on Luo Guanzhong's classical novel Romance of the Three Kingdoms, the historical text Records of the Three Kingdoms, and other related stories. Directed by Gao Xixi, the series had a budget of over 180 million yuan (US$30 million) and was released in China in May 2010."
Three Kingdoms,"2 years ago I set out to read/listen/watch the biggest old stories mankind knows and values, this a story I've been searching a really long time for. I'm on episode 5 now, thank you so much!"
Three Kingdoms,"Cool.

[You know the whole book is available to read on this website as well?](http://www.threekingdoms.com/)"
Three Kingdoms,So Netflix will be having two different Kingdom shows?
Three Kingdoms,Kingdom was a damn good show and so underrated. Jonathan Tucker in particular was great
Three Kingdoms,[removed]
Three Kingdoms,"Came here to post this.

Absolutely AMAZING show. 

Now I'm getting my hopes up that it gets popular on Netflix and they go for a new season."
Three Kingdoms,"This show is one of the best out there, incredible acting from everyone involved. Keeps you in the edge of your seat during the characters life’s. The highest of highs to the lowest of the lows. This show has it all"
Three Kingdoms,"The show ended like 5 years ago, did they need to convene a Zoom reunion for the announcement. Also if your going to do all that youd think they would have whats his face there to drive up interest. Nick too busy to open the damn app?"
Three Kingdoms,"The show was great. The last season and ending, were meh, but man, first 30 episodes were just fucking great. Grillo and Tucker delivered, and the writing was interesting, and felt like something new, rather that most every other drama on cable. With awesome highs."
Three Kingdoms,"I kept telling this to anyone who listened; Kingdom is one of the best dramas ever, it is the definition of hidden gem also the sheer level ol acting in that show is simply amazing, give it a shot people."
Three Kingdoms,"Hell yeah! It'll demolish on there, hope it gets the Netflix boost / acclaim and maybe even a lil follow up."
Three Kingdoms,"Does anyone know, if it will only be available in the US or also in europe?"
Three Kingdoms,"There are at least three shows with that name, one of which was already on Netflix. They should get all of them for completeness sake."
Three Kingdoms,Three now
Three Kingdoms,Jay kulina was the best written character in the series
Three Kingdoms,"Tucker and Grillo are amazing in it.

Tucker is nuts though. Everything I've seen him in, he's the biggest scene-stealer I think I've ever watched."
Three Kingdoms,"Both that ""Kingdom"" series and this one are really great.  Between these two and ""The Last Kingdom"" I think a lot of people are gonna be confused when they're searching around."
Three Kingdoms,"If you want to watch a great show called Kingdom, also watch the show this post is about"
Three Kingdoms,worldwide apparently
Three Kingdoms,"I completely missed the korean Kingdom because of that. I kept seeing article and posts about how great Kingdom was, and never investigated further because I had tried ""The Last Kingdom"" and it just did not work with me. At some point during the quarantine, bored, I finally looked at a few of the comments under a post to see what people were saying and got really confused when they started talking about zombies. Though I guess a show about vikings and zombies could be kinda cool."
Three Kingdoms,"Nice, thank you"
Three Kingdoms,I love this show. I wish it was talked about more here.
Three Kingdoms,I need to get back into it.  Got halfway through season one.  Not sure why I stopped.
Three Kingdoms,r/animalkingdom is growing and there's discussions for every weeks episodes!

Three Kingdoms,I love it and would compare it to a more serious Point Break
Three Kingdoms,"This was such a well thought out post! I just finished watching the finale and was pretty much as lost at the end as I was throughout this show. Your 3 possibilities helped make sense of it a bit, as well as the whole “save point” analogy. I do wish they had spent a little time explaining the whole world a bit. There’s a lot to be said for “show don’t tell” but it was a bit impenetrable."
Three Kingdoms,[deleted]
Three Kingdoms,"For sure, it's one of those shows where I have to pay close attention the entire time and compile possible theories in my head to continuously test against new evidence, foreshadowing, and elements as they come along. But I really like that kind of show hahaha, I'm the kind of nerd who has rewatched Fringe numerous times to check and see how the plot holds up. As I thought, air tight. 

Also I'm used to reading scifi as dense and convoluted as this, so it's fun when a TV show really goes all in like a novel you know?"
Three Kingdoms,"Ok, I dig it. Good expansion on the theorization. I hadn't considered the possibility that the haptics built in 2023 with future London intervention were advanced enough to perform all the functions of the implants in future London. Good catch. So, maybe Burton died from the device interacting with the haptics for too long, leading to Flynne putting it on herself and developing the bacterium, so Aelita is HER child/grandchild not Burton's? In which case it's wonderfully scifi tropetastic that she is romantically entangled with her descendant's adopted sibling. Juuust riding the edge of acceptably weird if you're a weird nerd. 

Either way, I'm still latched onto the idea that the infection that lead to the Klept wiping out the camps is somehow related to the data storing bacterium Flynne's got. If they end up cancelling it I'll just read the book (I normally do first in any case, but I enjoyed the first few episodes so much I didn't want to spoil it by reading the story by the time I knew it was one of Gibson's modern books). I must know how everything connects. The show laid out a great puzzle, clear enough to guess the shapes but not filled in enough to see exactly how it is completed."
Three Kingdoms,"When you say Kingdom, do you mean the Korean period drama with zombies?"
Three Kingdoms,"I'd drop each by a point, maybe House of Dragon by half a point, Witcher 2 and Rings of Power by two. Otherwise same.

None are incredible, House of Dragon is pretty sweet.

I'd add Sandman here as a solid 6, Locke and Key as 2 (dropped pretty quickly).

I'd say that the best recent non-horror fantasy films/shows have been HotD, the Dark Crystal Prequel Show, The Green Knight - all kind of lack freshness.

Edit. Everything, Everywhere All at Once is probably the best fantasy in recent years!"
Three Kingdoms,"I don't think it's fair to assess all other medieval fantasy shows using GoT as a benchmark. Sure, GoT has great production but some of the shows you listed have different structures, themes and focus."
Three Kingdoms,"HOTD >>> all others

No reason really to rank the rest, they fall into the category of if you like it than cool, if not thats ok too, they aren't prestige TV levels, but are more, meh, nothings on, Ill check it out, ok, this isn't awful, but its ok, I dunno, maybe I'll watch another episode, maybe not."
Three Kingdoms,"Enjoyed Kingdom a lot and I liked S2. I would give it an 8.5 but the movie was bad so maybe an 8.

House of the Dragon is like an 8 too. Don't hate me for this let me explain. I find the quality inconsistent. Episodes 1-2 are good, episode 3 is poor, episode 4 is very good, episode 5 was good until the ending which sucked, episode 6 was awful and episodes 7-8 were incredible. It's like at times I am thinking this is top-tier and other times I just feel disappointed.

I am not caught up with TROP and seem meh on it right now, but because it's a LOTR story and because we might get to see Sauron outside of a flashback I will definitely catch up.

The others I couldn't care less about."
Three Kingdoms,That Shannara series was terrible and nothing like the books. Watched it all though as it is one of my favourite book series.
Three Kingdoms,"I don’t rank disparate fantasy shows but I have enjoyed:

Game of Thrones

Rings if Power

HOTD

His Dark Materials

Wheel of Time

I think I would like Witcher but I really didn’t like the first season of it. I haven’t felt the urge to watch season 2 because I think I have to rewatch season 1 and I don’t want to do that."
Three Kingdoms,"i think rings of power and the witcher were great (8), and wheel of time (7) had some great episodes but ended a bit rough. still excited to see more.  i didn't finish cursed and im not sure what kingdom is? if it's that korean zombie series in the past i just wasn't interested."
Three Kingdoms,The one with zombies and teleporting baby.
Three Kingdoms,"Also wondering that. But surely not, right? That's not even comparably the same as the others haha."
Three Kingdoms,What's the issue? I'm interested what people think about shows from the last 3 years.
Three Kingdoms,"Wouldn't say Marco Polo (Netflix) is better than HOTD, but also wouldn't say HOTD is better than Marco Polo. 🤔"
Three Kingdoms,[deleted]
Three Kingdoms,">episode 6 was awful

I understand the rest but I don't really get this, and I've heard others complaining about it as well. What exactly was wrong with Ep 6? I thought it was pretty great and really enjoyed the introduction of the new cast."
Three Kingdoms,"episode 3 is on par with 4 if you forget the battle in the stepstones but maybe it is because I read F&B, this battle is pretty insignificant in itself but its consequences are big can you explain why ep 6 is awful?"
Three Kingdoms,"Well for starters, GoT is a relatively low-fantasy show because it does not use magic every 30 minutes, only a very low fraction of the cast is tied someway to magic, and fantastical elements generally take backseat for political intrigue/court politics. In contrast, *The Witcher* focuses more on monsters, killing them, the mages using powerful spells in battle while also having court politics in the background. If you're using GoT as the ""standard"" then does that automatically make *The Witcher* worse in that aspect?

Raunchy scenes will also set GoT apart from many of those shows by a mile.

Unless you're only using GoT as a temporal marker in order to come up with the group of shows you wanted to rate?"
Three Kingdoms,"Eh. I disagree. Marco Polo is better than the trash fire that is the other shows but in my opinion it didn't get to the level of HOTD. It didn't know what it was. Which led to a poorly put together story arch. 

To me it felt like someone was ready to make a historical epic but then they saw GOT and decided to shoehorn a bunch of fantasy elements into it."
Three Kingdoms,For anyone curious why there are a bunch of [deleted] comments in this comment chain: it is because u/PhilRiversOnTrakt can't handle downvotes. He literally cries so everyone please be nice to him.
Three Kingdoms,"Lol

Isn't your reddit account literally an ad?"
Three Kingdoms,">What exactly was wrong with Ep 6?

1. I felt no emotions in the scenes. When >!Laena died I couldn't care less!< we barely knew her and the scene just seems to lack the weight of what was written.
2. Larys does something completely unspeakable and it should be very impactful but it isn't because we barely know him.
3. The episode felt like it crammed too much into one episode and tried hard to be emotional but failed. We are properly introduced to Harwin this episode just for >!him to die in the same episode.!< The season as a whole has felt like the writers are just ticking boxes of events off and this episode was the worst offender of that.
4. Also, because of the actor swaps it suffered the most from its time-skip compared to other episodes."
Three Kingdoms,"Game of Thrones is high fantasy because it takes place in a world where our own doesn't exist, not because of how much magic it uses.

Low fantasy would be something like His Dark Materials or The Chronicles of Narnia."
Three Kingdoms,"You are overcomlicating the post for no reason.

I'm just interested about the subjective opinion of people."
Three Kingdoms,[deleted]
Three Kingdoms,"I think those are fair criticisms. I still liked Episode 6 and thought it had some great moments, but it definitely felt like a table-setting episode, where they were rushing through and skipping some things in service of getting to the parts of the story they were most interested in focusing on.

The Harwin thing is probably the most unfortunate omission in my opinion. I wish we could have had another episode that showed how he and Rhaenyra got together and at least get us a little bit invested in their relationship. Given how important it is that her sons are bastards, it would have been nice to get more background on that, and to get a fuller picture of Rhaenyra's life at that time. Would also have been interesting to see some interactions between her and Larys (and Harwin and Larys, for that matter) since he's technically the uncle of her sons, and I'm assuming he will play some sort of important (probably awful) role in future events that impact her and her sons."
Three Kingdoms,"I don't think we were *supposed* to care that much for Laena and especially for Harwin. I think they were just part of the events that move the story forward. Not every death is supposed to be a huge event, some people just die. And for a scene that short, I thought Laena's death was pretty beautiful. The way the dragon was hesitating to follow her orders was done really well! 

>Larys does something completely unspeakable and it should be very impactful but it isn't because we barely know him.

Should it be impactful? Again, in the grand scheme of things stuff like this is just part of the plot. Take Vaemond's deaths in the latest episode, while it was a pretty badass moment for Daemon were you really impacted by his death itself? Not really, we barely knew him. Side characters die all the time, not all of them can have some massive impact. 

>Also, because of the actor swaps it suffered the most from its time-skip compared to other episodes.

Now that's just a personal problem, I liked the new cast instantly!

I can understand some of the problems you're raising but I really don't feel like they are that much of an issue. In the very least the episode wasn't even close to being 'awful'."
Three Kingdoms,"There are two ways people interpret high or low fantasy. Some do it by location (as you mentioned), while some others base it on how pervasive the magical or fantastical elements are. That's why I try not to use those terms whenever possible but I had no other terms to use in my previous comments."
Three Kingdoms,"I think his point is that GoT could almost be viewed as a fictional period drama that occasionally has some fantasy elements on the very periphery. 

While most of the shows are pretty hard fantasy. 

Which is to be expected since GoT is designed as a subversion of LOTR"
Three Kingdoms,You do know we've been over this before and post histories are public my man
Three Kingdoms,">I don't think we were supposed to care that much for Laena

You think that  even though they were clearly trying to make the scene of her death seem tragic?

>and especially for HarwinI

The fact that Rhaenyra's children are bastards plays a big role in the story. Getting insight into how Rhaenyra and Harwin's relationship would have greatly added weight to this plotline. Or at least just getting to know Harwin at all. They chose to half-ass it.

>I think they were just part of the events that move the story forward.

Yes and that's what I am criticising. The show is just doing a tick box of events. They aren't characters they are simply plot devices.

>Not every death is supposed to be a huge event, some people just die.

Their deaths are not just ""people simply dying"". One was burned alive by her dragon and the other was killed in a fire caused by his own brother. 

>And for a scene that short, I thought Laena's death was pretty beautiful. The way the dragon was hesitating to follow her orders was done really well! 

I'm glad you liked it. I did not.

>Should it be impactful? Again, in the grand scheme of things stuff like this is just part of the plot.

Yes I understand that... but I don't like that. Having rich characters that the story respects and provides impact for when it comes to scenes like this was something GOT did well in S1-4.

>Take Vaemond's deaths in the latest episode, while it was a pretty badass moment for Daemon were you really impacted by his death itself? Not really, we barely knew him. Side characters die all the time, not all of them can have some massive impact. 

I mean **emotional impact** for the viewer. Not an overall impact on the story itself.

>Now that's just a personal problem, I liked the new cast instantly!

>ut I really don't feel like they are that much of an issue. In the very least the episode wasn't even close to being 'awful'.

Did you ask what issues I had with episode 6 so you could simply dismiss my criticisms and say they are down to personal problems?

>In the very least the episode wasn't even close to being 'awful'.

For me it was awful."
Three Kingdoms,"I use ""high fantasy"" but I find ""low fantasy"" a really contested term. It has 3 meanings for as I can see:

1. Fantasy that takes place in our world. Which basically means it is all fantasy that *isn't* in a fantasy world.

2. Fantasy with low amounts of magic. 

3. Fantasy that is 'gritty' or 'dark' - which would include The Witcher and Game of Thrones.

It's a messy term."
Three Kingdoms,">occasionally has some fantasy elements

GoT was full with fantasy elements: there were dragons, undeads, White Walkers, giants, mammoths, faceless men, greenseers, Three Eyed Raven and a shadow assassin. Some people were resurrected and one survived fire without any harm."
Three Kingdoms,"Putting aside all that, just saw your flair! A fellow AoT fan! One of my all time favorite shows. Can't believe we gotta wait another year for the 'final season' pftt.

You checking out Chainsaw Man? Just premiered yesterday, really fun!"
Three Kingdoms,Indeed it is contested. That's why I try to avoid it when I can but I was responding on the fly earlier and I couldn't come up with a description that won't take too much explanation. And now my haste has led me to end up explaining further after all.
Three Kingdoms,"It was all very much pushed to the side. The first season of the show literally has one opening scene and one other scene with undeads. Then dragons in the last scene. That's probably 2 minutes in 10 episodes. 

The dragons are infants until like season 5 and the undead plot gets maybe a few scenes until it ramps up in the 5th in 6th season. 

There is magic and fantasy, but it's very minimalist. Compare that to ROP where every scene has an Orc, Dwarve, Hobbit, or some sort of magical occurence."
Three Kingdoms,">Putting aside all that, just saw your flair! A fellow AoT fan! One of my all time favorite shows.

Yeh a very good show. I am nervous about how the final part will be done. I am hoping for a good ending. Hopefully, different to the manga.

>Can't believe we gotta wait another year for the 'final season' pftt.

They should have just called it S4, S5 and S6 lol.

>You checking out Chainsaw Man? Just premiered yesterday, really fun!

Yeh I saw the episode. It was really easy to get into and I like the colour scheme. It makes it look unique."
Three Kingdoms,">The first season of the show literally has one opening scene and one other scene with undeads. Then dragons in the last scene. That's probably 2 minutes in 10 episodes.

So what? The series was running for 8 seasons."
Three Kingdoms,">I am hoping for a good ending. Hopefully, different to the manga.

I haven't read the Manga yet, so all new to me! I've heard a lot of opinions about the ending, so really curious how the Anime does it. They had enough time and hindsight, so hopefully they pull it off! 

>They should have just called it S4, S5 and S6 lol.

RIGHT? I've no idea what's up with that. Just have 6 seasons, that sounds completely reasonable. 

>Yeh I saw the episode

From what I've heard the Manga is pretty insane! So really excited to see where all this is going."
Three Kingdoms,">I haven't read the Manga yet, so all new to me! I've heard a lot of opinions about the ending, so really curious how the Anime does it.

Best to go in blind. People are very split on the ending.

>They had enough time and hindsight, so hopefully they pull it off! 

One can only hope. I have watched too many shows that I loved end up providing disappointing endings. I don't want that to happen again.

>From what I've heard the Manga is pretty insane!

Definitely! Some crazy stuff. The ending of part 1 went crazy to the point I think many didn't expect the story to continue."
Three Kingdoms,"Definitely my favourite anime of the year, even though the ending seems a bit rushed"
Three Kingdoms,"I love the soundtrack, but hate the opening and ending songs."
Three Kingdoms,this isn't your blog
Three Kingdoms,"i kno. but instead of being all negative n shit, check out the show tho."
Three Kingdoms,You are on a sub for television. OP writes a review about a tv show. This is absolutely what the sub is designed for.
Three Kingdoms,[removed]
Three Kingdoms,One of my favorite shows of all time.
Three Kingdoms,The tales of ba sing se is my absolute favorite episode. The viewer gets a tremendously deep emotional understanding of each other characters in a short period of time. That scene with Iroh on the hill paying homage to his son was absolutely heart-breaking.
Three Kingdoms,"I finally got around to watching this.  I just started season 3.  I'm not really an anime fan and I guess I always thought it was a glorified kids show.  

I can't believe how wrong I was.  Avatar should be studied as Storytelling 101.  It's exciting and cool, creative, visually spectacular, but it's also a really sweet, simple story.  The affection the characters have for one another feels so genuine.  It's crazy how attached you get to them.

Uncle Iroh... oh boy, do I love that guy.

How do people feel about the Legend of Korra?  Is it a good successor?

Edit:  and it's funny!  Laugh-out-loud funny!  I watch at night and I keep waking up my kids."
Three Kingdoms,"I watched this when it first aired, loved every second and have rewatched it many times. 

I have my own daughter now, shes only just 1 but i'm counting down the days until I can watch this with her. I'm impatient but I don't want to do it too early so she doesn't 'get it'. 

Sadly it's a show that nobody in my life, besides my wife as I made her, has really watched. Maybe it's because in the UK bender has another meaning..."
Three Kingdoms,[removed]
Three Kingdoms,[removed]
Three Kingdoms,"After seeing so many positive things about it, I started watching it last year and finished it in just under two months.

I was expecting a decent show, something mildly entertaining perhaps to kill some time. Basically, as a 31 year old, I wasn't holding my breath for some children's cartoon. My expectations were blown away.

I don't think a show has ever lived up to the hype as much as Avatar: The Last Airbender did! It has instantly entered my top 10 TV shows of all time.

I can't think of any honestly negative things to say about it. Apart from maybe the fact that it finished! I wanted more time with these characters. :("
Three Kingdoms,"The birth of Zuko, one of the most well developed characters I've seen in any piece of media."
Three Kingdoms,"It's a good thing nobody ever made a ""Last Airbender"" movie. I don't think this story could be translated to the big screen."
Three Kingdoms,I cant believe its been 15 years. [My Cabbages.](https://i.imgur.com/GEivZmD.jpg)
Three Kingdoms,"A truly timeless classic. They say a show is only as good as its filler episodes. I’ll never forget Tales of Ba Sing Se.

Leaves on the vine..."
Three Kingdoms,"Ah ha, you see, the thing about this anniversary is that I AM GETTING VERY OLD"
Three Kingdoms,"End of Season 2. The wall, the drill, the Dai Li, the battle in the cave, Zuko’s internal struggles, Aang going to the next level...and then that shot by Azula. I almost cried, but at the same time damn, peak Azula, what a savage."
Three Kingdoms,"Confused by “On a less serious note ATLA is also the only cartoon other than SpongeBob to win the Kids Choice Award for Best Cartoon since 2003.”

Are there non-cartoon winners in that category?

Also, I’d maintain that book 2 is one of the best seasons of any show ever."
Three Kingdoms,"15 years later, and ATLA is still one of the best shows I have ever seen. My favorite moment has to be the moment where Iroh visits his sons grave. I still cry whenever I see that scene."
Three Kingdoms,"I think what I loved the most about the show was the duality between aang and zuko. The avatar is painted to be a great hero destined to bring balance to the world, but Aang is only 12! Err 112...but still 12.  Zuko is our 1st seasons main bad guy but he only seeks to regain his honor to redeem himself in his father's eyes, yet as he travels around the world he sees what his nation has done to the world and ultimately becomes the avatars' firebending teacher and good friend.

My favorite episode: episode 17 of s2"
Three Kingdoms,"*Avatar: The Last Airbender* is still my favourite TV show of all time, even after all these years."
Three Kingdoms,[removed]
Three Kingdoms,"Nick messed up by not playing a marathon for the 15 year anniversary.  

Also, no mention of the upcoming Avatar netflix series?  Both of the creators are on board as well as the same music composer.  I'm pretty hyped."
Three Kingdoms,"I think the best part of the show is that it is a rare example of a show really being ageless.

Little kids can enjoy the show for it's humor and action, older kids can learn important life lessons from it and for adults it's just a really entertaining story."
Three Kingdoms,"I was 8 when it first aired, and I remember being completely obsessed and watching every episode debut with my family. Brings back such good memories. Can’t believe it was 15 years ago ❤️"
Three Kingdoms,"I’m hopping dragon prince will end up as this grand adventure in story telling that the last air bender was as well. So far it is great, but I understand that for every great start to a tv show, it could end poorly *cough* Game of Thrones *cough*"
Three Kingdoms,"I've never watched this show. When I first saw the commercials many years ago, I thought it looked childish and disregarded it.

However the amount of love and dedication I've seen from the fans of this show (most of it here on Reddit) makes me think there might be something here worth exploring. A show doesn't get a cult following like this for no reason.

I have put this show on my list of things to try and look into this year. Hopefully, before the end of the year, I will be just as excited about it as many of you seem to be :)"
Three Kingdoms,"This was a perfect show. I watched it with my kids when they were toddlers. and my youngest is old enough to have actually bought the series. It's awesome, because she'll come out of her room and cast it on the TV. I got to sit on the couch with my 17 year old daughter and watch Sozin's Comet last weekend. 

The whole series holds up."
Three Kingdoms,"This show is filled with lessons about love, friendship, acceptance, and change. It's very special for my daughter and I. We watched it when it came out and we still talk about it today."
Legend of Yun Xi,I feel like the author needs to either watch or address shows like *Invincible* or *Pantheon*.
Legend of Yun Xi,I really love Vox Machina.  So glad we already know it will have a third season!
Legend of Yun Xi,Undone was the shit
Legend of Yun Xi,Anime Watchers: What gap??
Legend of Yun Xi,"Absolutely love this show, it’s just so much fun with great characters and voice acting and amazing fight scenes"
Legend of Yun Xi,Really feel the same way about it. The earnestness is what sets it apart for me. It wears its heart entirely on its sleeve from moving emotional moments of growth to the kind of raunchy jokes and swearing people rattle off with their real friends. It feels far more real.
Legend of Yun Xi,"It's fun. Too much toilet Humor at times but it's a nice destraction from the usual doom and gloom stuff.

The characters are assholes sometimes but not *all* of them and not *all* the time.

The world is colourful and bright."
Legend of Yun Xi,"Just finished the first season. Its ok... Nothing really spectacular storywise and the animations are a bit weak.

It might be because I've just finished shows like Invincible, Castlevania, and Arcane. But this pales in comparison. As someone not familiar with Critical Role, there's nothing I've gathered from the first season to make me care about the characters or the world."
Legend of Yun Xi,"It’s ok, but got tired of them trying too hard to be “adult” with the jokes, sex references and swear words. Like calm TF down and let your story breathe, folks."
Legend of Yun Xi,"It's become one of my favourite series of many many years.

Love the animation style, the characters, the silly jokes. I love videogames and medieval fantasy and we don't get many shows like it.

I had no idea what critical role even was before to be honest."
Legend of Yun Xi,"It kind of feels like ""Western anime"", to me. In that it's a lot of fun, but it *does* feel like it sticks to themes of ""the power of friendship"" a bit *too* much. Like... sometimes, it feels like they sort of achieve things through sheer power of *emotions*, rather than tactics.

I also feel like, as fun as the action *looks*, it sometimes feels a bit like visual-noise. I'm kind of a novice when it comes to tabletop RPG's, and my father (who I've been watching it with) had never played one (though he's a big fan of MMORPG's), and it doesn't feel like there's any sort of consistency on how powerful these characters are or what they can do? I don't need hard ""power-levels"" or anything, but it's just hard understanding where these characters are in relation to the world around them. They seem effectively demigods sometimes, and then relatively ""normal"" other times.

Overall though, it's been fun.

My only two criticism are A) they lean *super* hard into ""this character is on the verge of death! wait, not really, they're totally fine"". Like... it felt like almost every episode. A part of me actually *wants* a character to die -- not because I don't like any of them, but because it's a cheap writing tactic to get people invested, and they've done it so much that it feels like there are no stakes. Either stop doing the ""fake-out"", or actually kill somebody.

The other criticism, for me, mainly concerns Vax (I think? the male twin). I get Critical Role is all about being super inclusive, that's something baked-into the world they've made. For a lot of folks, and probably the creators themselves, that's part of the appeal. But it creates for kind of a confusing world when seemingly everyone is attracted to everyone else, and in the case of him specifically, I feel like it's created a situation where I don't understand what the relationship dynamics are supposed to be. It feels... inconsistent. The characters can all be Bi, that's fine, but just help us understand what their relationships are, to each other and to other recurring characters."
Legend of Yun Xi,"Yeah honestly it rubs me the wrong way that invincible came out first but vox got a s2 first.

Also I would probably put this lower than shows like invincible, Castlevania, Primal, and arcane. STILL really fantastic, but idk that's just me."
Legend of Yun Xi,"Easily one of the best animated shows I’ve seen. Considering that the original goal was one 22-minute special episode for longtime fans, the actual outcome is phenomenal. It’s amazing to see this love project become so successful. All of my love to the Critical Role Fam."
Legend of Yun Xi,Huge gap??
Legend of Yun Xi,"It's thoroughly okay, in all aspects. Fun time-filler but I wouldn't call it exemplary in any regard."
Legend of Yun Xi,world??? lol. japan put 20 anime a season. Gtfo.
Legend of Yun Xi,Vox Machina is just flat out a really good show.  I'm not a D&D guy at all and just randomly popped the show on one day and have been hooked.  Can't wait for season 3!
Legend of Yun Xi,"It is… okay. Lotta fan service that cuts into the show. I wouldn’t call it bad, but I really can’t suggest it to anyone who isn’t a fan of the stream."
Legend of Yun Xi,"Great show, definitely recommend it"
Legend of Yun Xi,This show is so amazing
Legend of Yun Xi,I had no idea that it was based on a D&D campaign. The table to screen compilations are 🔥🔥🔥
Legend of Yun Xi,I completely agree with the author! I love animated sci-fi and fantasy but typically these stories star teens. Matter of fact my husband has started teasing me about watching high schoolers save the world. It is not my fault that most things that fall into this category follows teenage protagonists. Things like Vox Machina and Lower Decks are a breath of fresh air for me! I get my animated sci-fi/fantasy with adult protagonists that I can identify with more and not so much of the goofy ridiculousness as you would find in things like Family Guy and Rick and Morty. I hope more stories like these start coming out cause I am here for it!
Legend of Yun Xi,So many better shows than vox.
Legend of Yun Xi,What gap ?
Legend of Yun Xi,"I dont know if I've just only seen shitty scenes from it, but the dialog is increadibly cringe in that show."
Legend of Yun Xi,"Just finished season 2. Would highly recommend.

It's got great voice acting, great art and superb story.

Can't wait for season 3."
Legend of Yun Xi,In the American view of the animation world.... Jesus.
Legend of Yun Xi,"I’m really enjoying Vox Machina, but it’s not “filling a huge gap” when there are tons of Japanese anime shows right now that honestly blow US cartoons out of the water.

Modern Western cartoon is honestly bare bone when it comes to finding good shows that isn’t shitty adult comedy/ Rick and Morty clones. They just never want to branch out to different genres and keep doing the same stuff over and over again. It’s either comedy or fantasy action, that’s it."
Legend of Yun Xi,Best show of the year so far
Legend of Yun Xi,"This show is actually very mediocre.

if ""ehh"" was an animated TV show, this would be it"
Legend of Yun Xi,Second season is even better than the first one.

Legend of Yun Xi,I completely agree with the author! I love animated sci-fi and fantasy but typically these stories star teens. Matter of fact my husband has started teasing me about watching high schoolers save the world. It is not my fault that most things that fall into this category follows teenage protagonists. Things like Vox Machina and Lower Decks are a breath of fresh air for me!

Legend of Yun Xi,"It’s genuinely just a fun show. Saw S1 when I had no real idea what Critical Role was, and was only vaguely aware of what DnD itself was or how it worked, but still enjoyed it a lot. 

Didn’t care much for the humor early on, especially in the first couple episodes- it actually reminded me a lot of the first couple episodes of Harley Quinn in how it just front loaded as much profanity, gore and sex jokes as possible. But it balances out over S1 and Season 2’s humor is, while still raunchy at times, far better balanced the same way Harley evened out. 

It’s definitely not a straight up grimly beautiful drama like Arcane. But its heavy enough to have substance while never being outright dour. It reminds me a lot of older scifi/fantasy adventure shows like Stargate, Farscape or Xena in how it has its heavier moments but there never stops being an underlying feeling of fun to it all, like it never takes itself too seriously. The kind of thing you put on and just have a good time with. 


I’d easily put it on par with later Castlevania seasons. Not as good as that shows first Dracula arc, but better than the subsequent ones. Vox Machina also seems to improve with every new batch of episodes as well. 

Id say its worth checking out for anyone who enjoys fantasy, and particularly found family stories, but isnt strictly looking for a pure drama."
Legend of Yun Xi,Just finished season 2 last night. It's a good show.
Legend of Yun Xi,"I enjoy the show to an extent but I feel like it is fueled by tropes and stereotypes. When an epsidoe begins, you almost immediately will know how it will end. I also hate how death is nothing in this show. And the modern spin coating everything is tiresome. I mean jesus... Grog is now just ""god of war"" but weaker and dumber. 

Amazon is afraid to get really creative. They play it too safe even in their great tv shows like The Boys or The Expanse."
Legend of Yun Xi,"As far as original shows go, it's certainly up there as a fantastic addition to streaming shows. Definitely one I didn't expect to enjoy as much after so many other stinkers."
Legend of Yun Xi,"To it’s credit I did finish the 1st season, but I just felt like it was so corny. Like I want American FMA, HxH, Monster, Berserk… not this."
Legend of Yun Xi,I completely agree with the author! I love animated sci-fi and fantasy but typically these stories star teens.

Legend of Yun Xi,"Vox is fun. That means a lot. Doesn't take itself seriously. Action, comedy, adventure, absurd musical numbers, and fisting jokes. Perfect TV"
Legend of Yun Xi,What’s the show about?
Legend of Yun Xi,"I really hope culture changes enough in the next years so that people don't write embarrassing shit like this anymore. ""Saving a fantastical world with the power of friendship isn’t just for kids."" *Yes, it is.*"
Legend of Yun Xi,Bruh how can this be adult animation with no comedic gore or gross humor
Legend of Yun Xi,"Pantheon 

Primal

Invincible

Castlevania 

*gestures vaguely at anime*"
Legend of Yun Xi,Arcane is amazing.
Legend of Yun Xi,Primal was fucking great too
Legend of Yun Xi,Don't forget Castlevania. I'm excited about that sequel series they revealed.
Legend of Yun Xi,"Those are coming-of-age stories with teenage protagonists, which is precisely what the author of the article *isnt* referring to in the title. 

VM is ""special"" because it has a cast of adult characters with adult humor going around fantasy land and saving everyone. Most shows with a similar premise tend to feature, like I mentioned, teenage casts and coming-of-age stories. Castlevania is the big exception, but it ofc has a very different tone to VM."
Legend of Yun Xi,PANTHEON!! Totally got screwed by it’s platform. If it was on a bigger/more accessible service that shit would have blown up.
Legend of Yun Xi,Then on top of those two you also have Dota: Dragon's Blood and Dragon Age: Absolution over at Netflix. I guess Arcane is more YA than adult aimed but it is definitely serialised fantasy in animation.
Legend of Yun Xi,[deleted]
Legend of Yun Xi,"They didn’t pay for an article, fuck em."
Legend of Yun Xi,And Pantheon got cancelled despite being awesome.
Legend of Yun Xi,RIP Pantheon.
Legend of Yun Xi,Arcane?
Legend of Yun Xi,Don’t forget King of the Hill
Legend of Yun Xi,"I feel like you should read the article, the author has seen those shows:

> The Legend of Vox Machina is not the first of these shows, but it is the one that made me realize just how wide the gap between Steven Universe and Rick and Morty is."
Legend of Yun Xi,"to be fair she said ""fantasy animation by adults for adults"" while invincible is a superhero show and pantheon is science fiction."
Legend of Yun Xi,"The author is an idiot, but this comment is hilarious because it's the most upvoted and yet dumbs down the conversation so much. Now we have to take a step back and explain to this smug poster what ""coming of age"" means"
Legend of Yun Xi,Also that they're working on Mighty Nein as well.
Legend of Yun Xi,"Critical Role gets a lot of love, and rightly so, but the space for actual play D&D style games has really blossomed ( partly because of CR).

My personal favorite is dimension 20 -- relatively high production values and a cast with a comedy background.

So if people want more of that sort of story telling and are willing to take a chance on medium, check out a few actual play shows and see if one tickles your fancy"
Legend of Yun Xi,They really have started to create harry potter levels of empire.
Legend of Yun Xi,"For sure, but rotoscope is kind of on the edge…"
Legend of Yun Xi,"To be fair the article does touch on that, even though a lot of anime is more willing to be mature a huge chunk of the mainstream ones are ultmately still coming of age stories about children, and a lot of these are still definitely aimed at children, we're just able to enjoy it too. One example I think about is how both Naruto and Ben 10 gradually aged up the cast, and once the cast got old enough instead of making a show about the adult cast they just reset to being about kids. 

Which isnt to say there's nothing like that in anime, I havent started new Trigun but old Trigun was definitely in that niche of action based fantasy/sci fi story about friendship. There is a lot if you search for it though I suspect the average anime fan just watches the most popular shows to come out each year like cartoon fans do. I also feel like a lot of mature anime about adults ends up not being action at all, Oddtaxi was amazing but I dont know if I'd say its comparable to The Owl House."
Legend of Yun Xi,"It seems like no one in this thread has actually read the article. The article is specifically talking about how VM is unique by being a high fantasy adventure comprised entirely of adult characters with no coming-of-age plotlines.

There are bound to be *some* animes that do fit that bill, but most anime fans will agree that the vast majority (especially the most popular) don't. Some fantasy seinen have mostly adult protagonists and themes, but almost always also have extremely dark tones and settings that Vox Machina avoids. They also rarely get any attention in the west, which is dominated by shounen."
Legend of Yun Xi,"The gap of non-ecchi anime.

I know some people can accept sexualized anime, but most of it is trash and feels very pedo. Girls who look childish but are “hundred year old demons” or whatever is fucking gross.

Even Your Name, brilliant until the end, all of a sudden up skirt shot at the end “but it was a boy in a girls body.” Fucking pervs."
Legend of Yun Xi,Shows that don’t have characters that need to go on internal monologues about how they need to be stronger and have more willpower for a decent 20% of the show’s total runtime in the voice registry of a 7 year old boy
Legend of Yun Xi,Cartoons
Legend of Yun Xi,"A shame the entire underdark got skipped, i liked the dwarf city and the party ""friend"" they picked up. Guess they didn't want more stuff with the dragonborn sorcerer"
Legend of Yun Xi,"Agree, the fight scenes are epic, especially the ones in the S2 premiere and the last three eps.  I really liked the character arcs for Vax, Grog, and Scanlan this season, too.  They are all great voice actors, especially the guy who plays Scanlan.  His musical numbers are always so much fun.  He is a terrific singer!"
Legend of Yun Xi,"The moment that really really sold me on the show was in episode 3 when >!Percy had a panic attack after seeing the Briarwoods and the whole crew came together, no jokes, no banter, and asked what they can do to help him. 
I was a little worried the show was gonna be a bunch of troppy assholes arguing the whole show, and had already written off Grog and Percy as 1-note, but that moment made me fall in love with the whole team. Percy and Vex are fucking adorable together!<"
Legend of Yun Xi,"I just wish they'd do a bit more show don't tell.

The last few episodes were at some points kind of ridiculous when it comes to flashbacks during pivotal character moments. You'd have long flashbacks to scenes that happened only one or two episodes ago."
Legend of Yun Xi,"Yeah, they did it their way. There aren’t corpo shills telling them, “no, we can’t have Scanlan sing about anal beads or masturbation.” They gleefully and accurately translate the spirit of that game into the cartoon. =)"
Legend of Yun Xi,"See I’ve never watched/listened to Critical Role either, but I loved the first season! I wasn’t expecting it to be groundbreaking or anything, just wanted to have a fun experience and that’s exactly what it delivered."
Legend of Yun Xi,"Did you really just compare the animation to invincible?? Where they literally had some of the hero’s moving through still shots? Don’t get me wrong, I liked the show, but vox machinas animation was MUCH better than invincible; which was clearly rushed."
Legend of Yun Xi,"Speaking as a fan of CR, the first season of Legends of Vox Machina mildly sucked, especially compared to other adult animated shows, like Invincible and Arcane.

The second season is much better.  Sadly, I don't think very many people are going to get through the first season with any impetus to watch on."
Legend of Yun Xi,"okay there's not much that can compare to Arcane, that's an unfair expectation"
Legend of Yun Xi,"I finished the second season. The show feels like it was written for CR fans, and no one else. The show starts with an already established group with characters in the middle of their own characters arcs. The second season is better, only for the fact the characters are a little more established. Otherwise,  you're correct, you have no reason to care about any of the characters"
Legend of Yun Xi,This is true the animation isnt great
Legend of Yun Xi,I feel like season one was kinda meh but season two is considerably better because it actually has character development for everyone.
Legend of Yun Xi,I must have been sick or something the week I watched Arcane.  Do not understand the hype at all.
Legend of Yun Xi,"It's essentially just a show based on scripted RP. No matter how vehemently the fan base screams that it's all organic you can definitely tell they've been workshopping their material with each other and coming with up bits to do together. It's scripted, workshopped, rewritten, and practiced. Both CR and the show by extension get a lot of leeway with various aspects of their performance because it's all supposed to be made up on the spot and you can tell it's just not. That's not a deal breaker for a lot people but it is for others. 

It's very average and pretty derivative (ie they have a character whose entire concept is ""Sokka but he gets laid"")."
Legend of Yun Xi,"I am pretty sure the source material had even more, just more improvised"
Legend of Yun Xi,Most scenes with that unfunny gnome make me want to drop the series.
Legend of Yun Xi,"Surprisingly the music is really fucking good too, Adds lots of point sin my book"
Legend of Yun Xi,"I tried getting into the show recently myself and I pretty much agree with that. Though I thought their horny for everyone thing was just them making fun of the decades old trope of every d&d campaign always having at least one guy that tries to sleep with everyone and everything and use charm for everything  (which in my gaming in middle and high school was certainly on point). 

But yeah the show overall reminded me of Saturday morning cartoons from the 90s. Not the good ones, but the stuff like Captain planet. I would definitely say we need more animation like that today. It's definitely not anime and its not adult animation, it's more like the older cartoons and that's pretty cool tbh.

Also I haven't read the article fwiw."
Legend of Yun Xi,">My only two criticism are A) they lean *super* hard into ""this character is on the verge of death! wait, not really, they're totally fine"". Like... it felt like almost every episode. A part of me actually *wants* a character to die -- not because I don't like any of them, but because it's a cheap writing tactic to get people invested, and they've done it so much that it feels like there are no stakes. Either stop doing the ""fake-out"", or actually kill somebody.

A lot of this is down to the source material being a D&D game. Because... yeah, nearly every big fight, at least one character was on the verge of death. If that wasn't the case, the game wouldn't have been fun to play. Additionally, >!they *did* kill a character this season - but of course, she was resurrected, because that's something that can happen in D&D.!<

They could definitely work on being more creative with the stakes, but when you have a character in the party that can literally magically heal just about any wound/injury, the stakes do have to be pretty high for there to be any tension."
Legend of Yun Xi,"eh, Legend of Vox Machina season 1 was funded by kickstarter, and Amazon came in 2019 to boost the season 1 funding and give the second season. Invincible released in 2021 - while LoVM release was delayed to 2022 - but LoVM could go straight into production for season 2 with no downtime once the writers etc were done with their portions for season 1."
Legend of Yun Xi,"Personal opinion, animated superhero shows aren't something new, we have tons of them.

Not interested in invincible because it's too violent for my taste.

But a medieval fantasy animated show? We have way less of those. The ones I remember now are DOTA, the Witcher animated movie, castlevania and dragon age absolution. And I loved all of those.

Also I love toilet humor, what can I say. I might be 40, but my friends and I still joke with that. So it's nice and refreshing when most adult cartoons in that style are a bit overly doom and gloom."
Legend of Yun Xi,"Let’s be real Amazon has the money to produce both at once, it was probably more a matter of choice considering how well received Invincible was and scheduling conflicts. I know Seth Rogan is a minor VA in it, and I think he also participates in writing and directing. I think it’s the same thing for The Boys. When Amazon has a banger of a show they typically know to keep it going and how to do so successfully despite some of the shitty adaptations. 

I mean didn’t The Expanse get picked up and flooded with cash because it’s a book Bezos enjoys? They do have big IPs they’ve made flop, so they aren’t even close to infallible, but they seem to do well with the content they manage to get roots in the ground for."
Legend of Yun Xi,"yikes, you must be never see damn thing else then. poor soul"
Legend of Yun Xi,"I know it doesnt bother some anime fans but sexualizing little girls is a big turnoff for most people not desensitized to it through years of anime watching. Its why anime like Attack on Titan and Demon Slayer break through to mainstream pop culture once in awhile; but the larger volume of series with names like ""my little sister is sexually frustrating me"" get ignored"
Legend of Yun Xi,"Yeah  
he's crying ""oh, we finally have a adult animated show""  
Wait, do you think stuff like Black Lagoon are for children ???  
Fuck, i am 45, and i still have a hard time watching the twins arc"
Legend of Yun Xi,I mean anime is almost as bad as cartoons are in terms of the good:trash ratio.
Legend of Yun Xi,I never watched role (but i do follow a different unrelated dnd group) and enjoyed it so its not  a prerequisite for enjoyment.
Connected,"No, it was suppose to be a self contained story and IIRC it was suppose to go for four seasons, however the ending of S2 works well as a series finale. S2 you will get a lot more of the lore and will probably answer a lot of the mythos questions you have."
Connected,"> Was there any books or comics or podcasts set in the universe?

Unfortunately, no. I'd love to read/watch more about that universe too.

'Counterpart' is one of the best Sci-Fi series about parallel Universe. J.K. Simmons was brilliant as Howard Silk, and the rest of cast was great as well.

Too bad that the idiots at Starz cancelled the show because, wait for it, [""The show’s audience was “too male” to fit into its new female-focused strategy.""](https://deadline.com/2019/07/counterpart-starz-cancellation-1202655113/)"
Connected,"/r/Counterpart is the sub for it and the creator has gone on and talked roughly about some events in future seasons (that are never getting made) and about the show.

DO NOT GO IF YOU HAVE NOT FINISHED THE SERIES. MASSIVE SPOILERS"
Connected,"Enough was answered about the mystery in season 2 that I didn't feel it ended on too much of a cliffhanger, but an extra season or 2 to wrap things up would have been better. I still recommend it to people."
Connected,"Oh jesus, really? smh"
Connected,They just need a baby Gandalf
Connected,I wonder if young people really care about Lord of the Rings.  I mean a *lot* of interest was supercharged nostalgia from the Jackson films.  It's not like my high school was full of people hyper pumped about reading Tolkein.
Connected,WOOT I'M still young at 34!
Connected,"The show sits in a weird spot where Tolkien diehards tend to think it deviated too much from the lore, whereas folks who know nothing at all about Tolkien tend to struggle to understand all the lore references and connections. 

I watched it with my family and they didn’t really understand any of the stuff about the Two Trees or the silmarils. No clue what the Valar are or that Sauron served Aule the Smith originally. No understanding that Sauron is a Maia or what a Maia even means. Some of the online theories, like that Sauron was on the raft because he was traveling to Valinor to repent for his servitude under Morgoth, would never occur to them at all. Basically, a ton of the depth of the show is just lost without any of that background knowledge.

Despite playing fast and loose with the lore, I actually think this show is less approachable than the original trilogy for someone who knows nothing about Tolkien. And I could easily see that driving the viewership towards an older audience who read the books or got exposed to the original trilogy as kids."
Connected,"I’m in my mid 20’s and I love LotR but I haven’t watched the show yet because it just didn’t look good. The trailers were weird and had like strange modern music clashing with the old epic mess the footage tries to instill. I wouldn’t say it’s missing young people because if the source material, more the way the show looks to be made and was marketed."
Connected,i'm surprised it's connecting with any viewers tbh
Connected,"As someone who is Gen Z, I honestly have a hard time finding peers that watch LOTR or Rings of Power. Most popular shows and IP's usually consist of Stranger things, Euphoria, Game of Thrones, Marvel, Star Wars etc"
Connected,"I'm 26, liked it but didn't love it. Had its fair share of absolute cheese, but some fun/interesting moments. But, what did I do after I finished the series? Watched Fellowship. They're not even in the same stratosphere lol"
Connected,"I was pretty much the only person on my social media who watched Rings of Power. Not quite the 35 bracket but close. 

Everybody else was watching House of the Dragon or Dahmer or something else. 

My wife doesn’t know a thing about Lord of the Rings and honestly it just got exhausting having to explain everything to her so she stopped watching after the premier. 

Rings of Power wants to have its cake and eat it too. It doesn’t bother explaining any of the more in depth lore, but also wants to attract new viewers. You can’t do that unless you expect everyone to have a Wiki on hand at all times."
Connected,As a target demographic person I just don’t care about ROP
Connected,"I question whether they’re really connecting that well with older people because I have an older friend group most above 35 and I cannot find one person who has a nice thing to say about this series out of like 30 people￼. Mostly they don’t even acknowledge it, more interested in other things￼. Very geeky. They’re looking forward to the war of rohirrim though."
Connected,I had asked a coworker if he had wanted it yet and he said it was “before his time” 😩
Connected,Do younger people use Amazon Prime?  I suspect more use Netflix and Hulu and services I've never heard of
Connected,"Lets pretend for a while that I am under 35 and have never seen LoTR movies or read the books. Which is the case with a youngin i watched the show with. We waited till the entire season was out so that we can binge it. 

Nobody understood jackshit. He didn't get any answers from the show, and i was thoroughly confused. It boring as fuck. 

Hope it gets better but my boy ain't gonna watch it again i can just sense."
Connected,If you haven’t read the books then it’s kind of short on action and if you’ve read the books then you might be outraged at the liberties taken with the story. They put themselves into a bad position.  They’ve chosen to ignore the core fans.
Connected,Inb4 Season 2 introduces an Jar-Jar Binks-like swamp creature named Borfo who has his own breakfast cereal
Connected,"This isn't a surprise, I don't see anyone talking about it on Twitter unlike HotD. It doesn't trend and isn't getting much discussion amongst the younger crowd even with the weekly releases which should benefit it."
Connected,I’m struggling to connect with the cast. Despite it being beautiful to look at I didn’t feel anything (excluding the dwarfs).
Connected,"The main problems with the show stems down to the characters having too much plot armor, and not enough world/character building. Sadly these are no small problems to fix.

The writers try to do world/character building like robots. Just *seeing characters talk* does not build their character! The audience does not care more or less for a character because they saw him/her talk for 10 minutes. 

Characters need to say and do funny shit. Make threats. Say things the audience relates and agrees or disagrees with. Do horrible stuff. Some characters need to hurt themselves, permanently even. 

We also haven't seen much of the world. We hardly see any maps, we see the same 3 towns over and over, and we're given no sense to how big those are. 

Everything just feels on a smaller scale than it should be. Numenor is going to war.... they send 3 ships with like 40 horsemen, after picking people in the town square. 

I mean come on. 

I'm gonna keep watching but only because I'm a lotr nerd, but sadly I think this show has already missed the mark too much on the first season. And to see them try to blame any critique on racist trolls is just infuriating."
Connected,Do a lot of young people even have Nielsen?
Connected,"Because almost nothing happens each episode? The only real event of magnitude with actual consequence was the creation of Mount Doom, which was the one part of the show I actually found interesting. This entire season felt like poor filler and somehow the characters are not fleshed out in anyway. All I know about Galadriel is she hates orcs and like horse riding a bit too much. All I know about Elrond is he does what the King tells him to do. They threw in a random Sauron and Galadriel romance plot rather than making Sauron straight up evil. Things just happen in this show for the sake of moving the plot forward, the rings of power themselves actually feel like an after thought."
Connected,"There's some shitty casting, overzealous acting, and bad directing

Trying too hard instead of just acting the part"
Connected,The characters are insufferable.
Connected,"It would help if the writers could build characters. I'm almost done with the season and there's still no reason to like so e of the characters. Showing the Harfoots doing chores all day doesn't make us like them. The story also feels like it has no direction whatsoever and very little actually happens in each episode. 

The visuals look really good, even if some of the details can be distracting, but most everything else leaves much to be desired. I had hoped that there would be a good score for the tv show, given how epic the LOTR score is, but it's so bad, I can't even tell you how part of the title theme goes after watching the whole season."
Connected,Because it's BOOORING
Connected,"I'm 41. It's a beautiful show, I see where they spend the money. That being said....it's somehow boring and I don't care about the characters. Then I said I didn't care for it and got called a racist. So I just haven't watched any more."
Connected,"Without the LOTR IP, season 1 was a generic fantasy show. And if you're not a LOTR fan, you probably felt it was very, very slow.

The problem is, younger audiences have already seen their fair share of generic fantasy shows. Shadow and Bone, Wheel of Time, Witcher. Without background knowledge of LOTR, you might've found RoP more boring than all of those."
Connected,"Much of the success of this show is banking on the fandom of people who loved the original trilogy and are Tolkien nerds to begin with. The show itself does not hold up on its own. The writing is bland, it feels like fanfic, and technically speaking knowing the issues with obtaining rights from the Tolkien estate, it is fanfic. Were it not for it's ties to the LOTR franchise, it would just be a generic unremarkable fantasy show that puts all it's effort towards special effects at the expense of actual meaningful storytelling. I wanted to like this show, I wanted to form by own opinions and brush right past all the manufactured drama online but I can't help it. This show is just tremendously boring and the team behind it even knows it with recent articles claiming season 2 is going to 'make up for it'"
Connected,"You know what… I don’t care, In fact, the fan base of mostly 2001 LOTR adults is who they should be catering to. They wanted Marvelize this wonderful show, and probably would do some bs move in the future to bait younger viewers. Let us hope they don’t."
Connected,"What percentage of Nielsen participants are minors or college aged or 24-34-ish, I wonder?"
Connected,"It was 8 episodes of meandering and wandering, ive never been so bored of a show. Even the battle episode at the farm was such a small scale feeling battle. Like wtf was that?"
Connected,I'm not surprised as the trilogy of movies came out 21 years ago. These 35 year old viewers were at the ripe age of 14. A perfect age to get into The Lord of The Rings.
Connected,There is a tempest in me
Connected,"Because it's an absolute bore?

I'm over 35 and I struggle to understand the ability of *any*one to care about anything in the show."
Connected,Is high fantasy even popular with the zoomers?
Connected,"Yeah, you create a show that has no redeemable quality aside from fringe nostalgic appeal, you won't connect to anyone who has no background with the content.  The story they chose to tell and their execution of said story with the glacial pacing and worthless content was so fucking stupid that there was no reason for anyone to try to follow along."
Connected,Or cuz it sucked 🤷🏼
Connected,Younger people might not connect with the books or the original movies from Peter Jackson. The return of the king will be 20 years ago next year
Connected,I wonder if Amazon is happy with this show’s Customer Engagement Ranking
Connected,"To be honest, it's been nothing special so far."
Connected,I (40+) watched it with daughter (<10).  On average that’s two 25 year olds.
Connected,"I liked the books, I liked the silmarillion. That means I don't care for fanfic that is purposefully changing a bunch of stuff because they couldn't or wouldn't get the rights to use the actual stories I knew and would have loved to see adaptations of."
Connected,I’m 47 and it failed to connect with me too! So slow and boring. Bezos already needs to do a reboot!
Connected,Why does everything on TV have to be about younger viewers? I don't watch tons if their shows. Also how many young people are actually watching TV.
Connected,"Born 98' 
I love Lord of the Rings, I grew up watching those movies and read the books (the Hobbit +LotR)  in middle school. In highschool I bought a replica of The  One Ring with the inscription visible and wore it for four years, only taking it off a handful of times (Usually because it fell off.) So you could say I've been a lifelong fan.

But the show just does not peak my intrest, While I love the world J.R.R Tolkien built and want to learn more about it this show feels like a cash grab. I'm not really looking to fund another space-cation for Mr Bezos."
Connected,41 here and this doesn’t surprise me. Tolkien is definitely for my generation and the one before me. I grew up in the late 80s watching the Rankin and Bass Hobbit at least once a month. And the Return of the King. And reading the books as a preteen to teen.
Connected,I feel seen
Connected,It’s struggling to connect with this older viewer too. I thought it was mostly boring.
Connected,"If you're going to make a show this fucking slow developing, you need to drop every episode at once"
Connected,"It's struggling to connect with any audience because it's a hacky piece of shit created, written, and produced by people who actively hate their target demographic and don't give a fuck about the world they're butchering."
Connected,Thats ironic because this felt like a show for kids
Connected,Has amazon considered fixing their shit UI to the point where it’s easy to find content you actually want? I’m sure that would help retain some ratings of this show few people asked for.
Connected,"Why would they not have included an opening narration sequence like the trilogy? I know they can easily be really awful but if any show needed it, it was this one. Like go back to the music of creation and hit the big high notes of history and most of the audience would have had some context at least. Like 5 minutes or less. On top of that, with all the cuts to characters and character teleporting there was no sense of place whatsoever."
Connected,"Cause they're paying for the streaming service probably?
Also LotR movies are quite old now so maybe the most interested people would 30+"
Connected,Tolkein some old ass nerd shit fam
Connected,"The problem with this show is how mediocre it is. None of the characters are interesting. The adventure itself seems mainly pointless. They could’ve done something great, but instead they made a show that honestly seems to be somewhat aimless and honestly is just boring. I’m a huge Tolkien fan, and this show just doesn’t capture any of the magic from Tolkien’s universe"
Connected,It struggles because the show sucks ass. People like lotr but not this lotr.
Connected,Struggling to connect with any viewers
Connected,It’s way too slow and boring
Connected,Galadriel twerking in Season 2 confirmed.
Connected,"Is that really a surprise? The original trilogy is nearly 20 years old now. 30-somethings should be the ages of most who watched it back then. 

No wonder their badass “I’m good” line failed to connect with audiences. Who knew the viewers weren’t a bunch of toddlers in diapers?"
Connected,"It's not surprising really. There's nothing compelling about the show for someone who hasn't read the books, doesn't know any of the lore and hasn't watched the original trilogy, which people under 35 mostly are.

Most of the characters are bland, and the main character is downright unlikable. The there is no basic 'hook', a core premise to the show (like the succession for the throne in House of the Dragon for example), other than a personal revenge plot for a character we meet for 2 minutes and care little about. And a part of the story (the harfoots) is entirely disconnected from the main plot. 

The entire point of the season only happens in the last 10 minutes of the last episode, and someone without any background knowledge still has no idea what the 'rings of power' actually do.

The dialogue is flowery but without any substance, and often insulting the viewer like with the rock vs boat example. Too many coincidences happen such as the protagonist and antagonist meeting in the middle of an ocean, and the plot in general relies upon coincidence after coincidence to drive it forward.

The show in general is just boring. And in a world with so many forms of entertainment available, it's no wonder that RoP is struggling to capture the attention of young people."
Connected,"I just don’t care for it. My parents love the show, while I was bored and didn’t care. I love the movies, and I’m reading the books now, but I don’t really like the show. Music sounds great tho."
Connected,"I'm below younger than that range and I'm interested in the show. I just haven't watched it yet because I'm waiting for the season to be over so I could binge it. I hate weekly episodic releases on streaming platforms and sure, releasing weekly will keep the discussion going on for a few months but it's just not for me. I also hate waiting a year+ in between seasons but that's not something I can help, lol. Now that the season is over, time to binge!

Doing the same with House of the Dragon."
Connected,"That’s rude. I’m 30 and I watched it. I could only handle 1 episode, but I watched it."
Connected,37 here. I fell asleep on Episode 4 and never went back. What a waste of money that show was/is
Connected,Well yeah. Only legacy fans are watching it and they also don’t like it. Your core demo is 40 something white men. There’s no big cultural build up because the show isn’t good enough for it.
Connected,Could it be because the lord of the rings came out 20 years ago now??
Connected,"I watched 1.5 episodes….loved the movies and the hobbit…this just isn’t grabbing my attention , like at all,"
Connected,Please lord give Galadriel some depth as a character or pivot to other story arcs more.
Connected,Age of the viewers doesn’t matter it being MEDIOCRE is probably more of a driving factor
Connected,It’s because it’s fucking boring
Connected,"Bottom line is the show was mediocre.  People like myself (36 and huge LOTR fan) watched it for some nostalgia and to see where the story went.

But based on sheer entertainment, it just missed the mark."
Connected,"Mid twenties here. My friends and I all agree, we have put off watching it because it seems risky to endanger our extremely positive memories of the originals. The last couple years have done their best to ruin stuff like Star Wars, Uncharted, the Marvel Reboot, etc. Especially hearing all the buzz news and controversy around it as a project makes most of us sigh and watch something else."
Connected,"It’s struggling to connect with (looks in mirror) older viewers too.
Mostly on account that it is utter dogshit. Poorly written, & horribly acted. The set design is terrible & the characters are one dimensional. I made it 3.5 episodes. It’s so god awful"
Connected,TIL I’m no longer considered a young viewer…sigh
Connected,"Because it’s not good lol younger people also know what’s up with what Amazon is doing and the older you get, the less you give af and, many times, value mindless entertainment more"
Connected,"There are not nearly enough people in these comments talking about how utterly shit the writing is. The dialogue is atrocious, the plot lines are confusing and poorly structured, the characters are hard to connect with and the pacing is a jarring mess. This show is an absolute disgrace from a storytelling perspective. No amount of expensive VFX and elaborate costumes is going to change that. It’s simply a bad show."
Connected,"That tracks with the main audience of the films as well as the more muted media conversation. It's not like no older people are on Reddit or Twitter, but they aren't as massive a group on the platforms. 

It also fits my general mood about the show. I like it. It's *good TV* in an era where more TV than ever is good. There isn't enough air out there, media-wise, for all the shows that are just good. The haters are going to hate, niches and fandoms will form, but TV that is only good won't make a big media splash like it would even 5-10 years ago, when *good* content like Jessica Jones or Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt could explode. 

The fact Rings of Power is a hit but doesn't feel like one (paraphrasing an analyst from the article) is that the budget, property, and platform would have guaranteed the viewer numbers unless Amazon goofed up. They didn't goof up. They just didn't exceed *good*."
Connected,"I think this is going to be an unpopular take among Tolkien fans, but LOTR is largely a victim of its own success. I grew up with Tolkien and still deeply enjoy the world, but a number of my friends find the world of LOTR incredibly boring. They’re all huge fantasy fans too. The problem is that all fantasy builds on Tolkien and we’ve had 70 years of iteration on a core story. Tolkien has become the vanilla ice cream. Still good, but it’s much harder to justify eating it when there are so many other flavors. 

Then you add in a time period most aren’t familiar with, a character that certainly isn’t a fan favorite among most casual fans, and then have Amazon, which is *very* hit or miss with its shows, produce it, is it any wonder some people aren’t tuning in to it? Especially when people’s time is more valuable than ever."
Connected,"Galadriel and her arch sucks and it got boring, so I stopped watching"
Connected,"I’m a huge LOTR fan. Played almost all the games, watched the extended editions, read the books. But I heard the show was boring af. Too many better things to watch."
Connected,"Well everyone 35 and under is using their parents login information, so that might be part of it."
Connected,Because it sucks. I just get bored 30 minutes into every episode
Connected,It's just not a very good show. That's really what it comes down to.
Connected,"I think this is the result of how tightly the rights to Lotr have been enforced, it's a finished series which movies released a couple decades ago. With nothing allowed to have been done with it there was nothing for the next generation to pick up.

Even now with this TV show they were extremely limited and only allowed to extrapolate from small appendixes fron the Lotr book."
Connected,It would have helped if the show was actually good.
Connected,Cus we still use our parents prime account duh
Connected,We resemble this headline. We're on the other side of 50 and really enjoy this show.
Connected,For what its worth im 42 and it bored me to tears.
Connected,"I tried to like it. I just wasn't invested in any of the characters storylines and found myself struggling to even want to keep watching. So, I dropped it at episode 4. I'm early 30s and enjoyed watching the lotr films and the Hobbit. I was excited for it but it just felt like it had a huge budget but not much substance and I wasn't excited about any of the storylines."
Connected,"Was 35 or older and probably thinking:""this kind of sucks"" but I want to see how it ends."
Connected,I’m in this age group and this show sucks. It’s like if network tv made LotR. They even seem to know it so they lean hard on what a better storyteller made in all aspects of their style. Every episode I’m rolling my eyes at something unbecoming of such rich source material.
Connected,No shit. It's a boring mess and the majority of people watching it are nostalgia addicts.
Connected,"I love the LOTR trilogy. I’m not even giving this a shot from the BS I’ve heard surrounding it, because if it was any good I would hear about good stuff. They really took millions of dollars and burnt it up on some shit that they had no idea what to do with"
Abandoned,">Let me tell you a dark, mysterious, and magical tale. The story of how an original idea becomes a multi-million dollar TV series that eventually got dumped in the garbage.

>The story of Carnival Row begins long before there were streaming wars fought over market share. In 2005, Travis Beachum, a recent college graduate, had his first spec script bought by New Line Cinema. The “dark neo-noir fantasy thriller” called A Killing on Carnival Row soon grabbed the attention of directors like Guillermo del Toro and Neil Jordan. After years of development hell, Amazon Studios bought the script in 2015 and decided to turn it into a big-budget fantasy series.

>Amazon’s streaming catalog in 2015 was a strange place. Their first original drama series Bosch had just aired. The idea was spreading through Hollywood that this streaming thing Netflix pioneered might just be The Thing that propels TV production into the digital age. Netflix already had gritty, critically acclaimed Marvel shows, and House of Cards was getting nominated for Emmys every year. Netflix even blew $80 million dollars on the Wachowski sisters’ insane sci-fi fever dream Sense8. Amazon needed something big. Something original.

>Carnival Row spent several years in development with Guillermo del Toro attached as a serious creative partner. He was going to produce, direct, and co-write the show alongside co-creator Rene Echeverria and Beachum. Del Toro and Beachum previously worked together on Pacific Rim, with Beachum being credited for the story and co-writing the screenplay. Thus, Carnival Row was set to be a huge original fantasy series, Amazon’s answer to Netflix’s big budgets and the new dark fantasy TV market that Game of Thrones opened up.

>But by 2017 del Toro was no longer attached in any form. The show eventually premiered in 2019, starring Cara Delevingne and Orlando Bloom. It received a mixed/poor response from critics. The series was bloated, bland, and not worth the investment in an age of Peak TV when 1000 great shows are competing for your attention.

>Carnival Row was always going to be a weird sell to audiences. Its neo-noir “steampunk with fae folk” gimmick is a niche interest even in the fantasy community. But for those who love that genre, there’s a lot to love in Carnival Row. It has extensive world building, lots of political intrigue, and pretty bland characters you can project anything you want onto. If you’ve ever wanted to see pixies fly around Victorian Streets or a satyr-esque creature read by candlelight in a three piece suit then you’re in luck.

First six paragraphs"
Abandoned,"> The writers knew this season would be the last, there is a concrete conclusion, and yet Carnival Row is still spinning its wheels up until the last few minutes. The creators built themselves a huge sandbox, but they don’t seem interested in playing with any of the toys they threw in

I mean, they’re trying to bring everything to a conclusion. Not the time to play around, unfortunately. I liked season 1. When Amazon releases season 2 (in full) I’ll finish it up.

Series aesthetic reminds of those fantasy shops that were ubiquitous before LOTR: Enya on a CD player, no licensed merchandise, just fairies, frog statues, tarot cards, and reflective sphere bird baths, with a kind and vaguely stoned old hippie smiling behind the counter."
Abandoned,"Good show. Unique and entertaining but COVID killed the show. Such a long break due to COVID that many have lost interest. I had trouble remembering what happened during Season 1 from three years ago, even with the recap."
Abandoned,"Part 2 of the nevers just released too, with a similar fate"
Abandoned,"This show isn't very good and yet I find it pretty watchable

The themes it deals with are worthwhile at any rate."
Abandoned,"Travis Beacham, how much suffering can one screenwriter endure? I forgot his other show Hieroglyph had an unceremonious end, that he wasn’t back for Clash of the Titans 2 or Pacific Rim 2, then walked off his own show Carnival Row which went from deltoro to delevinge, plus his AMC show went nowhere, I hope he finds some success"
Abandoned,Let's just scoop up the remainder of that budget and spread it evenly over Wheel of Time...maybe take the leftover drippings and drizzle them over a new adult animation in the works?
Abandoned,Amazing how every fantasy show has basically failed besides GoT this last decade
Abandoned,"I enjoy the show even if it's not quite good. It was just nice to see something wonderful and unusual. It doesn't talk down to its audience either which helps. A lot of genre stuff right now - they bring in novice writers who are more activist than writer and you get a terrible polemic and then when you voice your discontent are called horrible things.

The show deals with racism and colonization themes in a decent manner."
Abandoned,Cara has cool looking eyes though
Abandoned,"It's not a great show, but it's enjoyable. Moreso than Rings of Power and Wheel of Time, by a long shot"
Abandoned,[deleted]
Abandoned,"So I guess we can add this to the list of things that Guillermo del Torro was initially attached to and dropped that would have been interesting to see his vision for. Bummer.

His departures often seem related to conflicts over creative decisions too. You’d think executives would be confident in his abilities by now and just let him do his thing."
Abandoned,"I agree with this assessment. 

- What I wanted: A world where humans merged with the magical realm to create a steam punk world.
- What I go: A Victorian drama about politics with a subplot of flying people who are slaves."
Abandoned,"Bland and like everything out there or niche and only appealing to a small audience, you kind of have to pick a lane.









Anyways, it's worth watching for how they bring the world to life alone. It's so lived in, the costume design is fantastic, and it feels like there is little pieces of lore in every frame."
Abandoned,">Series aesthetic reminds of those fantasy shops that were ubiquitous before LOTR: Enya on a CD player, no licensed merchandise, just fairies, frog statues, tarot cards, and reflective sphere bird baths, with a kind and vaguely stoned old hippie smiling behind the counter.

Like every other woman whose teen years took place in the '90s, I am a sucker for this exact aesthetic, so maybe Carnival Row is much more my sort of thing than I'd always thought it'd be?"
Abandoned,"Three years, huh. Feels like alot longer..?"
Abandoned,Was it really COVID’s fault? They took a few months break during the initial lockdown but went back to shooting by the end of 2020 and it’s been wrapped for literally years now. Covid didn’t shelve the show for over two years.
Abandoned,I’m surprised this show gets so much criticism. I think it pretty efficiently tells a grandiose story with many important subplots. I was kind of lukewarm when the second season came around but started it and was hooked! I went back and rewatched the first season and could appreciate so much more without having to figure out who was who the second time around. Philo’s story is gut wrenching. His self loathing is really coming to a head in the second season but its origins in the first season are so well told. Cara is really exquisite- I can’t think of a person that embodies a fairy like her but her acting is great as well.
Abandoned,"Except *The Nevers* has been removed from HBO Max, and if you try to watch *The Nevers 1B* on Tubi, it's nowhere near the streaming simplicity of watching anything on Amazon Prime.

It's not only FAST, so you get ad breaks, it's ***linear*** (i.e., NOT on-demand). *You have to watch it live.* And Tubi in their infinite wisdom of attempting to minimize ad revenue as much as possible or something, is airing it for three days in *four-hour blocks in the middle of the day*. So, if you have a normal job/life schedule? Viewing this is probably not a doable thing."
Abandoned,It is not good.  I find Cara’s acting lacking.  Stopped watching after the first few episodes.
Abandoned,"It is such a shame, he’s a really nice chap too. We used to chat on Twitter back when it was a nice place to hang out, and he was so excited about his upcoming film with huge robots."
Abandoned,Nein?
Abandoned,They do a horrible job picking stories to make into shows
Abandoned,Ironically  a lot of fantasy series that were claimed to be next GoT have all failed. Like rings of power and wheel of time
Abandoned,"I remember back around 2011, there were a shit ton of fantasy and period shows released. The only ones with lasting impact were Game of Thrones, Vikings and you could make an argument for Spartacus."
Abandoned,"Arcane is superb on every level, but God only knows when we'll see a second season (or, she said darkly, whether or not Netflix will cancel it on a whim before then)."
Abandoned,Vox Machina enters the chat; fucks shit up.
Abandoned,Ironically  a lot of fantasy series that were claimed to be next GoT have all failed. Like rings of power and wheel of time
Abandoned,Okay…
Abandoned,Wasn’t that Foundation not Carnival Row?
Abandoned,That was almost certainly not this show since they never shot at the same time.
Abandoned,"> His departures often seem related to conflicts over creative decisions too. You’d think executives would be confident in his abilities by now and just let him do his thing.

If you run into assholes all day, you're the asshole. Maybe he's just difficult to work with."
Abandoned,Sounds like Bryan Fuller.
Abandoned,Probably so on the nose you’ll smell the patchouli while watching
Abandoned,">if you have a normal job/life schedule? Viewing this is probably not a doable thing.

Does knowing how to use qBittorrent count as having a normal life?"
Abandoned,"Oh man, Gundam!?"
Abandoned,"Totally. Dug Pacific Rim and the first season of Carnival Row. 

Hung with him at SDCC a couple of times, and he’s just a super nice, super passionate dude."
Abandoned,"Watched three eps so far, pretty happy with it! I like how the one guy has a firearm and it's totally useless most of the time."
Abandoned,"If you run into (incompetent and creatively bankrupt) executives interfering all day, you're the executive interfering? lol"
Abandoned,except he is extremely prolific as director? He just has a lot on his plate lol
Abandoned,"Ehh, not nessecarily. With The Hobbit, for example, it was clearly a case of the studios fucking around (which also harmed Peter Jackson’s efforts)"
Abandoned,"Looking at his credits, it's not super clear what Fuller actually does"
Abandoned,I'll amend: ...viewing this *legally...* :)
Abandoned,"The audio mix is pretty bad on th e torrented version , had to triple my TV volume to get audible conversations."
Abandoned,Pacific Rim.
Abandoned,Being prolific doesn’t stop a creator from being hard to work with. See: stanley Kubrick
Abandoned,"As a director? No, not really.  He's directed 5 movies and 7 episodes of TV (mostly animated) in the past decade. As a writer, kind of.

He's no more prolific a director than M Night Shyamalan"
Abandoned,"Yeah, he loves doing wild shit and studios hate that"
Abandoned,"This is of course hypothetical.

But my ethics run to having a membership for a dozen+ different streaming services and if I want to watch a show that is on a service I dont have I will buy that membership to watch that show and if that service has other things to keep me interested then congrats you won me as a customer.

But at some point, if you make it too difficult to watch legally, I will hypothetically resort to um alternative methods."
Abandoned,'Twas a very bad joke. The joke was that Pacific Rim is like... Kinda Gundam-y. Except Pacific Rim is *fucking awesome*.
Abandoned,"Stanley Kubrick has a reputation for sure but Guillermo has been around for decades and if anything has a great reputation

I personally believe he would just rather leave a project than have executives butcher his vision, which probably happens to the vast majority of projects, period. 

Refusing to sellout doesn’t make him an asshole. Obvi this is just my opinion and for all I know he’s a nightmare, but I really don’t think so."
Abandoned,"You are far from alone. But... justifiable ≠ legal.

I'm retired and have no life, so I sat through the ads and watched it live. Because I'm *damned* if HBO Max's attempt to stem their losses is going to stop me from adding to the ad revenue that will (hopefully) kick back to the creators of the show.

And the rumor is when Roku get the episodes, they'll be on-demand. Just saying, sailing the seas isn't the *only* path to take here, either."
Abandoned,"Sorry, I wasn’t giving Reddit my full attention, and I don’t know enough about Gundam to spot a joke. 

I’m with you on Pacific Rim though - I think it is the only film I’ve ever been to see at the cinema on my own, twice."
Abandoned,"After going up to the board and doing the Hammer dance rather than any analysis. He just goes back to his seat. 

""I'm done. I'm done. They just need a better team."""
Abandoned,"Charles looking downright svelte! Best he has looked in years 

And doesn't he have a hip and knee replacement? guy looks agile as fuck 

Good for him"
Abandoned,Why does Shaq’s laugh always make the shenanigans infinitely more funny lmao
Abandoned,Fucking lol at Shaq telling the guys off to the side to get a close up on Barkley
Abandoned,"I know Inside the NBA wins the sports Emmy every year, but they should legit also win it for the comedy categories lol

Funniest show on TV lmao."
Abandoned,"Serendipitous timing!  I was just reminding my friend that the [Hammerman cartoon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmZZG80TmME) existed in the 90s.  Nice to see that his memes are still 2 Legit 2 Quit.  None of the guys in the OP video has got buck, unfortunately."
Abandoned,"Probably cuz most people kind of have a higher pitch laugh but Shaq's voice is so deep it comes out booming and strong, the way he repeatedly says ""eh chuck"" in between chuckles adds to it too. I've never watched a full basketball game in my life but I have watched dozens of inside the NBA compilations. Big ol' San Antonio women. Wearing bloomers."
Abandoned,We all know Victoria’s a secret down in San Anton.
Abandoned,"The creepiest thing in this show was the pile of infected swaying together in unison on the ground. 

I like the kind of ""zombie Borg"" thing they are going for."
Abandoned,"I loved how every little noise in the museum would somehow sound like a clicker. And props to the VFX/design team, they looked amazing."
Abandoned,A zombie show accurately depicting how much it would suck to have to reload. Perfecto.
Abandoned,"So this episode all but confirms the theory that the outbreak began with contaminated flour (all the references to flour in the first episode, and how Joel and Sarah didn’t eat anything with flour for one reason or another); now the reveal that things began in Jakarta at a flour/grain mill.

Props to those who clocked it immediately, instead of piecing things together this week or further down the line."
Abandoned,"I hope every episode starts with a short back story segment like they did here. I'd love to see the world slowly fall into chaos, seeing it from a different part of the world's perspective each episode."
Abandoned,"What a nasty, horrifying kissing scene"
Abandoned,I’m just glad someone finally said it. Be silent! My pet peeve of people being in a terrifying situation but talking and acting like they are going to Disneyland. Listen to the silence. Let’s walk into a new building like we just got home and possibly die here.
Abandoned,That frog thinks he's Kermit playing the piano in a swamp or something.
Abandoned,They nailed the clickers
Abandoned,"I really appreciate how they've implemented a lot of the game mechanics into the show. It's neat to see things like paths being blocked and a characater squeezing through to open it up for the others, stealth and cover being so important, blunt instruments not lasting very long in a fight, and sometimes just needing to run like hell through a bunch of rooms.

I'm curious if we'll see scavenging for supplies, crafting items, and upgrading weapons as the show progresses."
Abandoned,"It was great having more of the origin story to the outbreak. 

Hope we get more. 

Imagine having to tell someone there’s nothing you can do to stop this from spreading. 

BOMB. 

Bomb the city and every single person in it."
Abandoned,"Thought it did an excellent job of showing how empty the world is. I also love that it’s intent on not being “another zombie show”. The tension leading up to the end was so worth it. Show runners have already said they aren’t doing spores in the air, so they needed a way to prove to Joel she really is immune. I think this was about as perfect of a way as you could do it. 

Off to an excellent start!"
Abandoned,"Loved it.

Opening scene was great.

I actually loved the fact that the military weren’t just being brutes or unrealistic but genuinely scare because the professor was scared.

Another thing that it does wonderfully to me is keeping the video game aesthetic sometimes.

When they leave the building to start their journey, it felt EXACTLY like the end of a cutscene in a game.

Overall great and sad episode and Druckman should direct more."
Abandoned,"Great episode. My only gripe was that they had all those guns, ammo, grenades etc in that building but left with nothing."
Abandoned,That intro was too real man. Everyone was playing it smart and there was no dumb character in that scene. Everyone was doing the best they can.
Abandoned,"* I really liked the episode intro. I hope we get something like it every episode.
* Greatly appreciated how scary and powerful they made the infected, I wonder if they can maintain this level of tension. Don't want them to become lvl1 mobs by the end of the season,
* Really hoped Tess would stay around for a bit longer even though she had some death flags. Liked the character/actress and thought the entire death sequence was great (and disgusting)"
Abandoned,That Tess scene was horrifying. I had a vague memory of her dying off screen in a gunfight in the game so the whole infected build up was extremely tense. The payoff was crazy. It caught me off guard to say the least.
Abandoned,The world design is so good it really feels like the game brought to real life
Abandoned,The museum segment was SO well done. And they captured the essence of the game perfectly. How Ellie moves around on her own and you'll often see her hiding behind cover in your line of sight like with this episode. The way they even moved around cover was just like the games. Those little details seem insignificant but they matter.
Abandoned,I'm really hoping every episode starts with a flashback to when the infection began. Having the micologist in Jakarta was such an interesting addition to the story.
Abandoned,That intro really showed why they picked Craig Mazin to run the show. Besides last weeks episode I haven’t been as unsettled by an unavoidable outcome since Chernobyl.
Abandoned,"the clickers were fuckying terryfing, I knew what would happen and I was afraid even so"
Abandoned,"God damn, they did like an entire ten minute build up before even showing a Clicker and it was _glorious_. The suspense they built with that was nuts."
Abandoned,Pretty sure when they get out of the museum and Joel swings his pack around its the exact same sound effect as in the game when you go to craft shit.
Abandoned,Watching this makes me hate the Halo show even more.
Abandoned,Damn RIP Olivia Dunham 😭
Abandoned,Loved the little addition of showing Ellie get bit a second time and having it compared to Tess' to better establish her immunity to the audience.
Abandoned,Clickers stay absolutely fucking terrifying. Jesus what an episode.
Abandoned,[deleted]
Abandoned,"Joel’s understated protective instinct in on full display in the clicker scene. During the quiet moments you see his “this is a job” facade, but when danger is there his unquestionable priority is the kid’s safety. All of the body language and emotion are perfect show don’t tell."
Abandoned,Joel reloading his revolver as the clicker was approaching was so intense. The reality of reloading a gun in real time was great attention to detail.
Abandoned,"Great episode imo, the scenes with the clickers were extremely well done and super intense, the opening in Indonesia i thought was fantastic too, loved that they did that and showed another country like that. I think Joel and Ellie should’ve grabbed some of those guns and grenades before they left tho, those gotta be super valuable especially when you out in the open traveling. Anna torv was great as Tess, a little bummed out she’s done already but she was great in her 2 EPs.  Anyway I’m really excited for the 3rd episode"
Abandoned,"Loved that opening. Felt very Chernobyl-esque

As a fan of the franchise all this additional meat on the bone to flesh out the world is what I wanted"
Abandoned,the actors for the clickers were on POINT.
Abandoned,He looked at his watch! I’m so happy ❤️
Abandoned,The intensity that were built up in some of these scenes were insane.
Abandoned,"I like how they added the fungus connecting.  Wish that was a gameplay features.  Definitely makes up for the lack of spores. 

The production is just top tier.  Nice having a weekly must watch show again."
Abandoned,The sets were the big stand out for me this episode. That alone really puts a huge divide between it and other similar zombie shows.
Dont Tell the Bride," “It went from satire to the thing it was satirizing.”  

Sounds like a Sam Levinson project."
Dont Tell the Bride,"> “It was a show about a woman who was finding herself sexually, turned into a show about a man who gets to abuse this woman and she loves it.” 

😬"
Dont Tell the Bride,">Casting K-pop superstar Jennie of Blackpink was the biggest get for Levinson. Under the show’s hashtag and teaser trailers, her stans steamrolled comment sections to cheer on the singer in her first acting role. But crew members claim Jennie has barely any air time and an inconsequential story arc. “It was like three or four lines per episode for her,” a production source says. “They didn’t let her talk that much. Her job was to sit there [and] look pretty, basically.” 

Like YG Entertainment would have agreed to anything more. They now have a well-established reputation for overhyping and underdelivering."
Dont Tell the Bride,Sam Levinson seriously needs to jerk off before coming into work.
Dont Tell the Bride,I went from wow that sounds like a mess to work on to wow an egg where and she is begging him for what?!?! I like dark shows and shows that push the envelope but this is not it.
Dont Tell the Bride,">The first public inkling of trouble came last April, when director Amy Seimetz, of The Girlfriend Experience and She Dies Tomorrow, suddenly exited with roughly 80 percent of the six-episode series finished. HBO addressed the news by confirming The Idol was set to have a major creative overhaul and would be adjusting the cast and crew. There was little explanation for the shakeup, except for reports that Tesfaye, who is co-creator, felt the show was heading too much into a “female perspective.”

&#x200B;

I mean, the protagonist is a woman, how is leading too much into a female perspective is bad?"
Dont Tell the Bride,"Man, I was mostly interested in this show just for Amy Seimetz. Replacing her killed my interest even before all that shitshow."
Dont Tell the Bride,"I understand that Levinson is a fucking creep, but let’s not forget that The Weeknd is co-creator, co-writer, exec. producer, and apparently put in the request that turned the show on its head. Whatever comes of this, he deserves just as much blame as anyone else, and it’s crazy that most people are kinda glossing over that."
Dont Tell the Bride,It’s insane that Euphoria will coast over 100 million for the next season.
Dont Tell the Bride,Every single thing I read about Sam Levinson screams *”I’M THE SON OF A FAMOUS DIRECTOR SO I THINK I CAN DO WHATEVER I WANT!!!!”*
Dont Tell the Bride,I seem to recall that the original director had wanted episodes exploring Lily rose depp’s character’s personal life and relationship with a childhood friend- good reflective stuff that gives the show depth. Anyway The Weeknd vetoed it for being too feminist 💀
Dont Tell the Bride,All of Sam Levinson’s projects seem like a dumpster fire to work on. His sets are always chaotic and messy and unorganized. And this torture porn thing is not a good look.
Dont Tell the Bride,"> Levinson allegedly stopped sending scripts to HBO and certain department heads, according to two people familiar with the matter. “I got the vibe that the mood on set was, ‘What’s HBO gonna do, pull the plug? Yeah, right. If they want a third season of Euphoria, they’ll give me what I want… We’re just gonna shoot what we want and if [HBO execs] have a problem with it, that’s their problem,’” they explain. 

wouldn't be surprised if Euphoria gets canned after this, the arrogance is astonishing"
Dont Tell the Bride,"*Seimetz seemed set up to fail from the start. When she arrived on set seven weeks before the show started filming, she was given half-finished scripts, a first-time showrunner in Epstein, a tight schedule, and near-impossible expectations from HBO, those sources say. “Amy was doing her best in an impossible situation, but she was going to lose this no matter what,” one production member says. “Honestly, I think HBO handed her a shit stack.” (Seimetz declined to comment.)  HBO had wanted to keep costs low with a series budget around $54 million...Euphoria’s upcoming third season, which is expected to cost at least $110 million.*

So they wanted to do it cheaply, didn't make sure the script was done, drove the director out of the project before it was done, reshot the whole thing writing it in a completely different way...  It's sounds like the developmental execs at HBO are terrified to do their job well given all the projects getting axed by the new overlords."
Dont Tell the Bride,I know several people worked on this show and I’ve yet to hear a single person say a good thing about it. Such a fucking mess and it definitely crossed into dangerous territory once Levinson was there.
Dont Tell the Bride,They gave The Weeknd too much power and not surprisingly he went on an ego trip. He has that movie with Jenna Ortega and Barry Keoghan that he's also writing and producing up next which is too bad because we'll probably hear something similar there.
Dont Tell the Bride,"""Falling too much into a female perspective [paraphrased]”

Dont Tell the Bride,I'm not going to be surprised at all if some kind of Kevin Spacey/Bryan Singer/Harvey Weinstein type stories come out about Sam Levinson. I am surprised they haven't come out yet.
Dont Tell the Bride,"I'm genuinely starting to believe that this show does not and never will actually exist, and that its seemingly neverending promotional rollout/behind-the-scenes soap opera is in itself a work of Andy Kaufmanesque performance art. Certainly I'm no closer to knowing - beyond the bare-bones outline - what the hell the actual story is supposed to be than I was when it was first announced approximately two thousand years ago, so maybe it really is all just an elaborate Situationist prank?

At any rate, I think it's very funny that everyone's wringing their hands about an obviously planted story that paints the show as a dark, dangerous, boundary-smashing orgy of decadence, which just so happens to be the exact image its makers are going for. [This legendary Onion story](https://www.theonion.com/marilyn-manson-now-going-door-to-door-trying-to-shock-p-1819565904) kept springing to mind."
Dont Tell the Bride,ok but that egg scene? have you lost your damn mind levinson?
Dont Tell the Bride,"Levinson sounds like a budding Weinstein. Dude's private, sketchy predilections coming out publicly, and all he gets is more money and power. 

When someone shows you who they are, believe them the first time, Hollywood."
Dont Tell the Bride,The Weekend is a misogynist? How unsurprising.
Dont Tell the Bride,"Even since it was revealed that The Weeknd felt that the show was heading too much into a ""female perspective"" and therefore decided to change that I knew the show would end up being messy."
Dont Tell the Bride,Kpop fans will make or break this show.
Dont Tell the Bride,Sam Levinson’s got some issues.
Dont Tell the Bride,"Warning: Rape, Sexual Assault

“At various points, Levinson’s scripts contained disturbing sexual and physically violent scenes between Depp and Tesfaye’s characters, three sources familiar with the matter claim. In one draft episode, there allegedly was a scene where Tesfaye bashes in Depp’s face, and her character smiles and asks to be beaten more, giving Tesfaye an erection. (This scene was never shot, the source says.) Another proposed scenario was for Depp to carry an egg in her vagina and if she dropped or cracked the egg, Tesfaye’s character would refuse to “rape” her — which sent Depp’s character into a spiral, begging him to “rape” her because she believed he was the key to her success. (This scene also was not filmed because production couldn’t find a way to realistically shoot the scene without having Depp physically insert the egg, another source explains.) “

Can someone check Levinson’s and The Weeknd’s hard drive and search history please. I know that these ended up not getting filmed but why were they up for consideration in the first place?"
Dont Tell the Bride,"Slightly off topic but does anyone else share this opinion about The Weeknd:

He sings about all the drugs and sex he does but form the very beginning I was like “nah,  I don’t believe you.”  He’s trying too hard. Like that kid that brags about his hot girlfriend but you don’t know her cause she goes to another school. He’s always giving lil dick energy. Some artists can pull it off, the attitude, the machismo, but not him. He’s a dork to his core. A pretender. 

Solid pop music though. Can’t argue with his phenomenal success!"
Dont Tell the Bride,I mean Euphoria was softcore porn with the appeal of teenagers pretending they invented fucking wasn't it?
Dont Tell the Bride,This will either bomb or this will be such a huge hit that talking heads will question if this is the further moral decline and decadence of society.
Dont Tell the Bride,Well I'm glad I'm not the only person who thinks Euphoria is creepy voyeurism and not the show of a generation anymore
Dont Tell the Bride,Wish Harmony Korine was at the helm 😀
Dont Tell the Bride,[removed]
Dont Tell the Bride,"Tbh, you could also make a fine argument about euphoria glamorizing drugs and debauchery, more than actually addressing its problems. Just watch the first few minutes of the very first episode and you'll understand,lol"
Dont Tell the Bride,Same with Euphoria.  It’s porn.   You can tell his intended audience is one that enjoys sec versions of saw.
Dont Tell the Bride,"Reading the whole article, it appear that as problematic as Sam's writing is, the issues were apparent long before he took over.

Looking at some of these quotes in bold:

**As promising as those initial scripts were, the scripts for the final episodes were still only half-finished and the finale completely unwritten. Seimetz was encouraged by HBO and producers to put her own spin on the show and write the last episode, a source explains. As a result, Seimetz was polishing up scripts and writing while directing. She also had her assistant, who had no previous credited writing experience, writing scenes, with HBO making the assistant a staff writer last January. (The assistant did not respond to a request for comment.)**

**Organization quickly evaporated, mainly due to changes in the script, sources say. One production member says the first version of the show went through more than 20 rewrites, saying scripts were being updated constantly: “We did it every fucking day. It was insane.** 

**Eventually, the crew say they stopped getting one-liners, an industry term for daily schedules of what was being shot. And the few one-liners that were given out quickly became useless due to changes, sources say. Decisions were being made on the fly, frustrating several crew members who say they felt they could never properly prepare for the next day of work. “I’d be driving home [at the end of the day] and they’d be like, ‘Oh, we’re adding a scene, but it hasn’t been written yet,’” one says.** 

**A report from April blamed the show’s overhaul on Tesfaye, who was reportedly unhappy that the story was focusing too much on Depp’s character, according to Deadline. A source with knowledge seconds that Tesfaye was the reason behind the shakeup, wanting to tone down the cult aspect of the storyline and pivot into something else entirely, dropping the “feminist lens” through which the show was being told as a result. “It was like the Weeknd wanted one show that was all about him — Sam was on board with that,” another source explains to Rolling Stone.**


In a six episode season, if you still have unfinished scripts for the remaining episodes and an unwritten final episode while you are filming an hectic production, it is obvious that the problem are deeper than just one person.


From reading the quotes above, It look like nobody had any actual finished outline of what direction the show was going toward or how it would end since they admitted that they already have gone through 20 rewrites while Seimetz was still in charge of the show. 

When you are rewriting scripts that many times and you still haven't even finished the scripts for the remaining episodes in a six episode season, it will be difficult to have a coherent story and character development. 

The crazy thing is that if this was a 22 episode season, it would make sense to have rewrite or revision to the scripts due to the length of the season but when you are struggling to write up only six episodes with a small timeframe for shooting and production, this is basically an issue from HBO management to the writing team. 

As problematic and disturbing as the reports have been about Sam especially backstage on Euphoria, it appear that just blaming him is the easy way out regarding the issues plaguing this show. 

The article make it clear that the issues were there from the first day of production before he was even involved and that the issues just kept getting worse as shooting continued. 

Also, It look like Tesfaye wanted the show to be more about him and his character compared to Depp's character. When you have one of the two Main Character of the show apparently having an issue with a woman character being the focus, you are going to have a difficult time appeasing him unless you recast him with a new actor who would be fine with allowing a woman to shine.

Honestly, you can just lay the blame on HBO management which appear to have an unrealistic deadline and a refusal to oversee what actually is going on regarding the scripts and production."
Dont Tell the Bride,"His Netflix film, Malcom and Marie was utter garbage in my opinion. I enjoyed Euphoria but when I look back on why I enjoyed it nothing comes to mind. I tried rewatching it with my girlfriend and found it to be more annoying than thought provoking or even entertaining."
Dont Tell the Bride,I always found the critics absolute obsession and love for this show odd. The length to which they show drugs and sex not only feels weird to watch it’s also just not accurate. Then again maybe most of the critics hadn’t experienced high school in some time so they actually thought this was accurate.
Dont Tell the Bride,Honestly I stopped watching euphoria after a season because it just made me feel yucky.
Dont Tell the Bride,What an awkward headline
Dont Tell the Bride,This is giving Marlon Brando/Bernando Bertolucci vibes (IYKYK)...
Dont Tell the Bride,"Sam do be into depraved, toxic sexuality."
Dont Tell the Bride,"on the fence about whether this is *intentional* marketing -- but given that this exact article has been posted on Reddit 11 separate times, has almost 1500 comments on this thread alone, Tesfaye had a targeted and ready-made clip to respond to Rolling Stone with, and it subsumed discourse all day yesterday on other social media platforms incl. Twitter, I'm pretty sure it generated exactly the kind of outrage/buzz that will propel the premiere to sky-high viewership. Happy to revisit this comment when the show premieres and eat my words if I'm wrong but I doubt I will be. It's worth noting that the loudest critics of Euphoria have usually watched 16 episodes, maybe even all 18.

I'm pretty disturbed at how comfortable everyone is casually slinging around rumors about Levinson being some kind of predator, though. Not only is there zero evidence of that, but there's not even any *allegations* of him being remotely creepy. There's not even anything to disprove, just people clearly hoping that bad things will come out about him presumably because they dislike his work so much. Levinson certainly doesn't seem to find his own work as titillating as everyone here clearly does -- [seriously, I'd recommend reading this THR interview with him, he comes off as very thoughtful and just...not creepy](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/euphoria-creator-boundary-pushing-hbo-drama-didnt-pull-punches-1218588/) -- and nearly all the social media comments are bursting with inter-generational hysteria about Kids These Days and dismissing Euphoria as porn while clearly ignoring the fact that Euphoria is making a commentary on how the ubiquity of internet porn has affected culture and particularly teenagers. I respect it for at least trying to start a cultural conversation on how porn is affecting youth and sexual expectations/gender dynamics especially when a lot of the takes around porn are just like, ""why don't you just jerk off in the privacy of your own room, you sick freak, and we can all pretend this huge cultural force doesn't exist.""

All this is not to discount the worrying accusations in the article, such as that of a disorganized set -- poor work conditions are no joke -- but all of the other stuff like the description of the egg scene, which wasn't even filmed, is to some extent clearly being enjoyed as salacious and transgressive by those who read it. Rape kinks are real and [not uncommon](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19085605/), another thing that could stand to be critically engaged with instead of acting like it's some collective dirty secret. Maybe the show failed at that but we can't really say until watching, which I'm sure most people will -- but I'm fascinated by how many people will eat up Levinson's work and then will completely miss the commentary or continue to insist he's some pervert. This conflict between what people do/want and what they openly admit to doing and wanting is a running theme throughout his prior work....and if you don't believe me on that then read the THR interview. anyway, ready to get downvoted into oblivion lol"

Dont Tell the Bride,"Zendayas story arch aside, Euphoria is just Degrassi with penises."
Dont Tell the Bride,This is pretty obviously some marketing hype disguised as an expose.
Dont Tell the Bride,"Why do people keep hiring Lily-Rose Depp?

How much is this costing her dad in influence and cash?"
Dont Tell the Bride,"I’m not a huge Euphoria fan, and I tend to agree that Zendaya’s arc is definitely the best (and maybe the only good) storyline, but I’m always a bit confused by Reddit’s disgust for the show. 

It’s definitely not a super realistic depiction of high school and it’s way over dramatized, but people do drugs and have sex in high school. I went to a tiny school and even there we had heroin addicts, meth addicts, etc. People had sex at parties. It was certainly way more awkward and not as glamorous as it is on Euphoria, but Euphoria is purposefully melodramatic.

The nudity can be too much, but all of the actors are in their mid-twenties. I don’t really agree that it’s pedophilic of the creator to depict high school sex.  All of Harmony Korine’s early movies had  more fucked up stuff involving kids and teens than Euphoria does."
Dont Tell the Bride,Euphoria sucked so I’m sure this will too.  At least it looks like the characters are supposed to be adults at least.

I want to be captivated, not shocked. It has nothing to do with my beliefs (atheist) and I'm not sexually frustrated, I just hate it because of how unnecessary it is. If I wanted to watch porn, the internet's full of it already. It's not art, it's just showing everyone you're a fucking pervert."

Dont Tell the Bride,"I'm sure the production of the show has been bad. But this article, to me, seems like it's slanted in a weird way.

The article seems written to imply that something changed from the ""original"" show to ""the current show"" due to the involvement of Levison and The Weeknd. But Levinson and The Weeknd created the show.

I'm failing to understand how the show transforms from A to B when the creators are also the same people leading now. I would understand it if you said it went from A to B to A, but that's not what it says, nor does it say Seimetz rewrote the whole thing. The current version of the show sounds exactly like Levinson and The Weeknd, so how could it have been different in the beginning and why would they have wanted it to be different?"
Dont Tell the Bride,Who exactly is surprised with those two involved?
Dont Tell the Bride,This is such a load gossipy bullshite. How is rolling Stone even in publication still?

(This scene also was not filmed because production couldn’t find a way to realistically shoot the scene without having Depp physically insert the egg, another source explains.)""

How hard is it to shoot that? You shoot an angle of hand with egg going between her thighs, you cut to a reaction shot of her face. I mean, we've been simulating actresses being penetrated for decades without actually penetrating them, this cannot be difficult."
Dont Tell the Bride,"What's missing from the story, because it's sourced by anonymous people who clearly wanted to publicize Amy Seimetz's perspective, is The Weeknd's vision of the show. They say it's about a guy's sexually abusive relationship with a woman but missing is his point. 

It could be wish fulfillment smut but there could be  something interesting he's wanting to land on that just wasn't what Amy was interested in doing. 

Messy production and sexual minefields aside, artists can connect with different aspects of a vision and end up running in opposite directions. I loved The Girlfriend Experience and find Amy Seimetz a great director but this may not have been the project for her. Also the Weeknd has never produced a TV series before and relied on Sam Levinson to execute his vision but Levinson was failing everyone

Either way I'll be watching, always down to see a beautiful mess of a series."
Dont Tell the Bride,Nice marketing. When does it air? Sounds interesting.
Dont Tell the Bride,"Unpopular opinion; i can see theWeeknd and Levinsons point of view.  If you want to make a dark and disturbing noir tale about how easy people can be used and abused, you have to show that. Film it. You cant just have have characters say things are bad then turnit in to the triumphs of the independent woman.  Which it sounds like what was happening.  The original director was turning it in to something hopeful and uplifting how the female character perseveres over all obstacles- which is the opposite of the story youre trying to tell"
Dont Tell the Bride,"This comment section is weird. You can tell when people already have their mind made up about something based on what other people have said. It’s just a circle jerk here of people saying basically the same thing.

This is a tv show we are talking about right? They can do whatever they want as long as everyone involved is on board.

We’re getting to this point where sex and nudity in mainstream media has to be tasteful and meaningful and it’s bad if it’s it’s gratuitous. Gratuitous violence is ok though. But at the same time so many people are making a killing on onlyfans servicing that side of what people want. It’s like we’re trying to hide that part of what people are. But at the same time empower people to do whatever the fuck they want. So what if it’s torture porn? Don’t watch it if it sucks. Dude’s out there making what he wants and what some people want to see."

Instinct,"Everyone else in In Plain Sight. Mary was a b#### of epic proportions. It was hard to watch.  She did a short-term stint on ER and was exactly the same. So I don't think it was the character, I think she's just a horrible person."
Instinct,"the Expanse, holden is so boring compared to everyone else"
Instinct,"Tokyo Revengers is the most definitive answer to this.

Takemichi is like the worst most dislikable AND useless main character to have ever been created, his whole role is just to be camera for the viewer and everything happens around him. He is a TIME TRAVELER with the power of future knowledge yet he always knows the least in every possible scenario. Automichi can be removed and its a much better show."
Instinct,"Superhans, Jeff and Johnson in a road trip movie together would be amazing."
Instinct,New Girl. The boys stole the show over Zoey Deschanel.
Instinct,Will and Grace.  I think it should have been the Jack and Karen show
Instinct,News radio - Dave the station manager was s straight man where all his co workers were the funny ones.
Instinct,"Abbott Elementary, easily. Quinta Brunson is okay, but her co-stars are consistently funnier. Maybe it has something to do with the Janine character and how its written. 

I even like the earnest lead who wants to do good archetype, like Leslie Knope is one of my favourite characters ever, and easily my top 3 favourite characters on the Parks and Rec, and would be my absolute first if not for Aziz Ansari being so damn funny

The West Wing is another. I really want to like Rob Lowe as Sam and I do, but as the show progresses he gets less and less to work with, while Richard Schiff, Allison Janney, Bradley Whitford, Janel Moloney and Martin Sheen consistently knock it out of the park"
Instinct,Scrubs
Instinct,"By far and away, Snowpiercer."
Instinct,"Hated Raymond, but loved the cast of ELR.  I can’t stand to watch any of the episodes which feature Raymond or his marriage to Debra too prominently because I thought he was a horrible husband and an all around asshole/ jerk of a man… 🤬🤬"
Instinct,Young Sheldon.
Instinct,Breaking Bad
Instinct,"The good wife. 

Alicia is a well written and complex character but the cast around her was so rich and engaging"
Instinct,Lost.
Instinct,"Frazier. And nothing against Frazier per se, but Niles stole the show— especially the Niles-Daphne plots."
Instinct,JoJo's part 5. I like Giorno but the rest of the gang is phenomenally entertaining
Instinct,"You mention Frasier, on Cheers he was the character I liked the least, but ‘Frasier’ is one of my all time favorite sitcoms. The character did grow on me, but I agree that Niles and Martin made the show. Granted it’s because of their great chemistry with Frasier."
Instinct,Buffy
Instinct,"Barney is the only likable character on How I Met Your Mother (especially towards the end), even though he'd be the creepiest person in real life. He's also the one with the most character growth."
Instinct,Grey's Anatomy is the first show I think of for this
Instinct,The Wire.
Instinct,"Park and Rec, Leslie is not the reason I watch or rewatch the show.  She’s beyond normal office crazy.  When her and Ben get together later on I always wonder what he sees in her.  It’s a consequence of the writing of course, bc most PaR plots begin with Leslie screwing something up through overconfidence.

Just about every other character knocks it out of the park."
Instinct,"Grey's anatomy. 

Without jack I would not have watched 24. Without Meredith I would not have quit after 2 years 

Also on er I did not like Doug or Carol or that tortured love story

And the good wife."
Instinct,"She’s not terrible but it’s more that she’s excellent at a relatively small range of characters, and the show pushed her out of that range, while also showcasing how damn good actors like Dichen Lachman, Enver Gjokaj, and Amy Acker are at taking on a wide gamut of characters. My dream redo for this show is casting Dushku as the FBI agent pursuing the case instead of Tahmoh Penikett."
Instinct,My impression while watching Dollhouse was that no one really got a full chance to get things right before they changed. Repeatedly.
Instinct,"Thats kind of the point of the show, the Dolls are the the background driving force for the ""regular"" employees."
Instinct,I came in to say this. Piper was the least interesting character on the show.
Instinct,"Richard was the entire show to me, to the point where I've never finished the last season because without him I just don't care."
Instinct,"Honey, we talked about this..."
2gether: The Series,"So this proves (again and again) that HBO has the recipe for good television drama.

Why can't any of the other networks figure this out?"
2gether: The Series,Nothing to add besides: I’m just really glad this show ended up in the right hands. Could have turned out very differently somewhere like Netflix or Paramount
2gether: The Series,I knew it was going to be big but jesus it could potetentially become HBO's biggest show if it keeps this up.
2gether: The Series,"I hope the success behind TLOU will give us better adaptations. Seriously, there’s no excuse in bad shows with high budget."

>The penultimate episode of “The Last of Us” Season 1 reached an impressive 8.1 million viewers on Sunday night.

>According to Warner Bros. Discovery, that makes Episode 8 the series’ most-viewed thus far. Previously, that title belonged to Episode 3 with 6.4 million viewers, though the company did not make data available regarding the audience size of Episodes 4-7.

>The 8.1 million viewers who tuned into Episode 8, titled “When We Are In Need,” contributed to a 74% increase from the viewership of the series premiere, which drew an audience of 4.7 million people and was HBO’s second-most watched debut in over a decade."
2gether: The Series,Can we just note fungus in the end saved him. Penicillin?
2gether: The Series,"I started watching it alone, now I watch the episodes with a group of 6. Definitely spreading through word of mouth because I tell everyone I know to watch it"
2gether: The Series,[removed]
2gether: The Series,"I am watching this show with MY GRANDMOTHER. It’s so crazy to me that in this day and age we can bond over something of a shared interest! Me, knowing exactly what happens and seeing her watching in suspense is always a great feeling for me. She adored Sam and Henry and was like “I hope they make it through” when they approached the sniper on the street. I was just sitting there silently and she’s like, “you know what happens don’t you?” She was devastated but the >!bloater ripping the head off!< had her so intrigued, also realizing >!David and his group were a bunch of cannibals!< had her so hooked it’s amazing. Thank you HBO for creating something we could bond with in a way that I never thought!"
2gether: The Series,"HBO treating The Last of Us as prestige television. Great writers and creatives on board to adapt the game properly

EDIT: Praise Druckmann!"
2gether: The Series,"I've never played the game but I'm enjoying the show and it's been moving, but ""I got you baby girl"" is what finally made me burst into tears."
2gether: The Series,That episode was INCREDIBLE!!!
2gether: The Series,Bella Ramsey crushed it this episode. What a powerhouse.
2gether: The Series,"It was nearly a 1:1 of this section of the game, and masterfully acted. A+"
2gether: The Series,I’m so glad Amazon or Netflix didn’t get ahold of this show. So refreshing seeing people actually give a fuck about the original material.
2gether: The Series,"It's pretty good, I'll admit I had my doubts but the 74% is for sure word of mouth. Everyone around me told me it was 🔥 and now I'm suggesting it to others. It makes sense."
2gether: The Series,"Ever since I played the game for the first time way back in 2013 I knew it was one of the best stories I’ve ever been told and it just makes me so happy that so many people are experiencing this amazing story for the first time, I certainly didn’t expect that it’d come close to Game of Thrones/House of the Dragon which is arguably the biggest TV show of all time."
2gether: The Series,"Damn amazing number, shame it has to compete with the Oscars for the final episode."
2gether: The Series,[removed]
2gether: The Series,"I haven’t watched a single episode, I haven’t seen a single spoiler, and on March 12th I’m binging every fucking episode and I can’t wait!!!!"
2gether: The Series,Been such a great show so far. The best video game/movie adaptation.
2gether: The Series,I remember the time when 8.1 million views meant cancellation of the show
2gether: The Series,Wonder how long it’s gonna be until other networks/streamers announce their own zombie/zombie-adjacent shows to ride the hype.
2gether: The Series,"This was a great episode.  I ended up rewatching the [video game playthrough](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AaaGoWfOhY&ab_channel=CouchSoup) with commentary from Troy Baker and Ashley Johnson.  They did a great job capturing the story.  

Fun fact!  Troy Baker makes a cameo as James in the tv show!"
2gether: The Series,Netflix totally gonna pivot some shows to one episode a week. Their shows hit and the conversation is gone in a week.
2gether: The Series,"I was in the real town they filmed that in a few weeks ago, was cool to see it."
2gether: The Series,It’s sooooo good! Like sautéed portobello good!
2gether: The Series,"As someone who was wildly impressed back in 2013 with the game and the story. I’m just as excited to see the show doing so well, people that worked on the show seem to have enjoyed their time together, and it has kept the heart of the story. Well deserved praise for The Last of Us."
2gether: The Series,Happy for Sony and Naughty Dog.
2gether: The Series,ELI5: are people not watching the rest of the season and just watching episode 8?
2gether: The Series,Video game dialogues are top but I like how ‘sort of close’ they are to it compared to the game.
2gether: The Series,"Amazing production for both fans and those new to the series. Not only did they stay true to the story’s themes but the deviations they’ve introduced seem to augment them instead of reduce them.

I can’t help but imagine if Henry Cavrill and Sapkowski were able to work with HBO instead of Netflix…"
2gether: The Series,And this isn’t even counting all the people pirating it!
2gether: The Series,Good stuff
2gether: The Series,Best episode yet
2gether: The Series,"Forgetting the game exists, after watching the walking dead for however many seasons I got through I absolutely got worried they were going to stretch this ""villain"" out and then remembered it's the last of us lol. It was nice not having a drawn out enemy that just gets worn out too fast."
2gether: The Series,"I just want to throw out there that between episodes of TLOU, I started watching Station Eleven, another post-apocalyptic drama and I’ve never seen anyone mention it but if you haven’t seen it, it’s excellent. Very different from TLOU; slower, less action but engrossing. The base story is about an acting troupe that makes a living circling lake Superior going from one small community to the next performing Shakespeare. 

Maybe I just missed it when it first came out and I’m late to the viewing party or maybe it just got overlooked. Either way, if you are looking for something to watch when the credits roll on Joel and Ellie, it’s out there."
2gether: The Series,"Any recommendations for single player PS games that focuses on story and isn't open world?

I don't really have time anymore to sink it big open worlds, I love TLOU part 1 & 2 because the story is so good and so tight. Would love to play something similar."
2gether: The Series,It’s a good show
2gether: The Series,"That was an intense episode.

Having Joel up and running and killing 3 men seems a bit of a stretch when he was bed ridden minutes before."
2gether: The Series,[removed]
2gether: The Series,Ellie was a BOSS in this episode!
2gether: The Series,Some people are going to be real upset when it doesn’t drag out for 11 seasons like TWD.
2gether: The Series,"My only complaint with the show is I think they're going too fast. Instead of 9 episodes, it should have been at least 15. A lot of the moments in the game that in my opinion are crucial to character development and the development of the relationship between Joel and Ellie have been skimmed over, or cut entirely, and honestly I don't think the point their relationship is at in the show makes sense within the context of what's actually happened in the show. I think it would have benefited from a slightly slower pace that told more of the story. But that's just like my opinion man."
2gether: The Series,"Bella Ramsey did an awesome job this episode. Lots of high emotion and fight choreo scenes.   
  
And then I watched Pascal take care of a different, greener adopted child right after. Dude’s having a dad year."
2gether: The Series,The finale few minutes were pretty amazing in that episode 👌🏻
2gether: The Series,This episode was the most intense 50 minutes of tv. Absolutely marvellous.
2gether: The Series,"As much as I wanna see the new ep so bad, I really thing weekly premiers are the way to go"
2gether: The Series,[removed]
2gether: The Series,RIP to all the haters that said Last of Us was B-tier story at best if it was filmed.
2gether: The Series,I am trying so hard to like this. apparently I'm the only one who thinks it's average.
2gether: The Series,"Every week, a friend texts me that The Last Of Us must have been one interesting game… almost as if he’s insinuating that what’s in each episode wasn’t part of a pretty rich series of games. And every week, I reply “yup, it’s a fantastic story that they’re adapting brilliantly!”"
2gether: The Series,"So lucky to have had such a wonderful adaptation of such a treasured game and story to so many people. I have my own nitpicks and I agree that they are having to speed through some sections but I genuinely don’t think people realize how good we have had it. Brilliant acting all around, showrunner who loves the source material, original creator heavily involved, original composer doing the score, beautifully shot — a dream come true compared to most adaptations (let alone game adaptations)"
2gether: The Series,Yeah I mean it's one of the best shows I've ever seen. Deserves all the praise.
2gether: The Series,"I love it. Theres a lot of content out there, a lot of good content even, but this show is great."
2gether: The Series,I love this show!
2gether: The Series,I'm ready to be hurt again...
2gether: The Series,what delicious numbers
2gether: The Series,10million by the end! Let’s do it!!
2gether: The Series,"I can't get the original game out of my head, but when they use a similar scene, it's incredible."
2gether: The Series,She went into beast mode and I loved it!
2gether: The Series,It was a great Episode!
2gether: The Series,Crazy good episode
2gether: The Series,This is by far one of the best shows I’ve ever seen. I love what they’ve done with it and how they make things a little different from the game to keep you guessing. Everything about this show is amazing. I’m so glad they knocked it out of the park.
2gether: The Series,"Bellas performance in episode 8 was incredible. 

“Tell them Ellie is the name of the child that broke your fucking finger!”"
2gether: The Series,Last night episode was so fucking good
2gether: The Series,Its really not that good..but i guess enjoy?
2gether: The Series,Episode 9 is gonna have more than 10M and gonna surpass House of the Dragon season finale numbers.
2gether: The Series,Why tho? That dialogue is ass
2gether: The Series,"Anyone else think it was way way over rated? I quit pretty quick. Episode one was good and sad. After that I thought it was lame and felt really cheap for HBO. 

Just my take"
2gether: The Series,Shit is so good
2gether: The Series,"my biggest issues with it are the 

1) goofy ahhh kathleen episode and the ending action scene

2) the time skip being in the new spot was altogether worse for the pacing and character development

3) the impalement scene was weaker in the TV show"
2gether: The Series,"They had to make up for episode 7.  What a, predictable, snooze fest that was. Ep. 8 kicked ass tho"
2gether: The Series,The worst part of this show is the astroturfing.
2gether: The Series,This Pedro Pascal guy is having a great start in acting. Maybe HBO or even Disney might give him more roles in the future.
2gether: The Series,"Sorry this show is overrated. It’s fine, but people acting like it’s the next Sopranos or something."
2gether: The Series,"It's a good show.

Let's see how they handle... Well... You know.

Honestly if they deviate for a bit it probably wouldn't make people hate them... But they gotta do it right... 

Either way, they gotta do it right.

Edit: Jesus Christ, what's wrong with you people. We're discussing a tv show why are you people so damn vitriolic. I didn't even state how I felt about the show doing one thing or another, just that I hope whatever they do that they do it well."
2gether: The Series,"I gotta say, I never enjoyed the gameplay of the original game, but I am loving being able to enjoy the story without dealing with the gameplay!"
2gether: The Series,"Lazy question.

But as someone that hasn't played the games.

Wil the show follow the entire game series and then just stop, or is it loosely based and will it divert from the games to create a season 5-6-7-8 etc?

If it's even known"
2gether: The Series,I can’t believe my eyes how insanely accurate the sets are. It’s incredible
2gether: The Series,Netflix so jelly right now.
2gether: The Series,What a fantastic fucking episode.
2gether: The Series,"Whatever the HBO recipe is, never change it. My all-time great dramas is like mostly HBO at this point."
2gether: The Series,"See, this is what happens when a production company makes an actually good show"
2gether: The Series,Love the show!!
2gether: The Series,"I see a lot of comments saying “see this is what happens when…” and crediting some cocktail of budget, faithfulness to the source material, etc, but really i think it’s just well-written and well-acted. The writers wrote a compelling show, HBO probably used many of the same technicians and film crew as they have in other successful shows, so that was done well also."
2gether: The Series,This was the best episode of the show 🥺❤️
2gether: The Series,"Such a GREAT episode 👏 


Well done , and I NEED more .
This is coming from a person that’s NEVER played the game before."
2gether: The Series,That end scene had me ugly cry
2gether: The Series,Well ! It’s a really good show for one thing ! And it’s really well made ! And the characters are amazing !
2gether: The Series,I just watched all of the episodes this week. The numbers are obviously because of me.
2gether: The Series,I’ve loved this series I do wish there were more zombies though
2gether: The Series,I've absolutely loved the show but feel they're making a mistake by moving things along so quickly in order to follow the events of the game.
2gether: The Series,"Don't get me wrong, I am loving the series, but am I the only one wishing there was more conflict with the cordyceps? It is like they skipped the whole first few years of the outbreak and went full bore into the Walking Dead equation where the main conflicts are coming from humans trying to survive against other humans with differing views on how to advance society as it fights to regain its hold over the World."
2gether: The Series,"Is this episode better than 7, my God that shit was boring. Just had to skip it."
2gether: The Series,"If they lost the flashback scenes with bill and Ellie.(make them bonus episodes inbetween seasons, it’s been done) and replaced them with scenes from the game they obviously skipped over, this would be 20/10 game adaptation.

Ready for the rate downs, fight me."
2gether: The Series,"One episode a week is the correct recipe. Giving each episode the respect it deserves. Just like back in the days shows…
Releasing a show like this all at once is a crime. We all watch one, talk about it and the word of mouth just makes it even more special. #hatebinge"
2gether: The Series,Well I hope everyone’s enjoying it at least.  I didn’t get anything out of this one.  Just seemed like more of the same zombie stuff to me.

It was a pretty big book, but it could've easily been told in one season of a show."
My Perfect Landing,"Bloodlines… A perfect single season, take off the tag at the end and it’s done."
My Perfect Landing,"Wayward Pines. It was written and shot as a miniseries, and adapted the entire trilogy it was based on. Fox sat on it, believing it would flop, and when it didn't, they rushed a second season into existence in only 9 months, despite none of the actors or writers being locked down to return, resulting in a pointless season 2 that feels like a direct to video sequel"
My Perfect Landing,The Terror
My Perfect Landing,"I have to agree with Squid Game. It feels the story was perfect to fit one season. The surprise element is now lost. However, I also think I'll have to actually watch Season 2 to confirm this impression. Maybe they'll come up with a different, interesting story."

My Perfect Landing,"The Handmaid's Tale is a 300 page book that they finished adapting at the end of season one, and then just... kept going, to increasingly diminishing returns."
My Perfect Landing,"Big Little Lies. I thought the ending to season 1 was perfect just the way it was.

Edit: Sorry, I guess I didn't read much past the question and saw that OP already suggested this one. I agree."
My Perfect Landing,Altered Carbon
My Perfect Landing,"Prison Break. I mean, the question of how they get away while on the run is a relevant one, but (1) they've already broken out of prison and (2) except for some arcs, what we got was stupid as fuck, where the first season was really good"
My Perfect Landing,"Westworld.  First season reveal was the perfect level of head fuckery, really should have been a one and done deal."
My Perfect Landing,Once Upon A Time
My Perfect Landing,"Gonna say Sneaky Pete. The storyline in season 1 was a neat little arc. Once it got away from Marius's brother and his past criminal dealings and leaned entirely into the family he was pretending to be a member of, it just fell apart."
My Perfect Landing,I am glad that the HBO Watchmen series ended after one season. It was a great followup  and yet standalone story (better than comic sequels) and ended at fine stopping point. I don't need to see any more
My Perfect Landing,"13 Reasons Why. For every single reason. The big ones being the book’s story was fulfilled in the first season, and then it became sad riverdale."
My Perfect Landing,Heroes
My Perfect Landing,West world.  A slight different ending but just a epic first season
My Perfect Landing,"Your Honor. 

s1 ended perfectly, with all the characters getting their resolution for the most part from the events that took place. When me and my wife saw s2 as a thing we just shrugged and asked “why?”"
My Perfect Landing,"I completely agree with Squid Game.

People have this weird thing where they constantly want more, even if having more isn't really what's best.  Sometimes, it's OK to be hesitant with a story's natural conclusion.

For years, Lois Lowery refused to write a sequel to The Giver. She preferred the readers to decide what happened in the end. It was a brilliant ending that challenged young readers to use their imaginations, but readers kept pestering her until she eventually conceded to their demands. The result was fine, but not at all what I had envisioned.

Squid Game's ending had a similar set-up with our hero and a child poised for the ambiguous happy ending that could have been very satisfying, but dashed it to bits in the last moment. While I'm sure it will have strong viewership in its next season, I'm genuinely uninterested. I don't need more of the same, nor do I need some crazy twist."
My Perfect Landing,Wayward pines
My Perfect Landing,The Handmaid's Tale
My Perfect Landing,"Jessica Jones’ first season was an incredible, personal story about how Kilgrave had wrecked havoc on Jessica’s life. She finally came to terms with her trauma and overcame it, leaving the show feeling wrapped up.

But then it had two more seasons. I felt that Season 2 really struggled to justify why I was still following this character, so I didn’t bother with S3."
My Perfect Landing,Bloodline
My Perfect Landing,"Altered carbon. 

The first season of the show and the book were great. The second book was... Not and it's evident in the show."
My Perfect Landing,"Quantico

I thought S1 was just brilliant television.  I was hooked and satisfied at the end and didn’t know how they could possibly follow it up.  

I think they did do a good job in S2 with the follow up.  But it didn’t capture the magic that S1 had.  

S3 was so bad that it ruined the show in my opinion.  

So long story short- Quantico could have been a truly special series had they let S1 be the show.  But trying to drag it out ruined any value the show had."
My Perfect Landing,The End of the F***ing World.
My Perfect Landing,The Watcher. What the hell else is there to mine from that concept? First one wasn’t even very good at all
My Perfect Landing,"The Morning Show. Season 1 was an incredible ride where all events and storylines led to a brilliant climax. Characters were compelling, tension was high, and the payoff was huge.

Season 2 took some hard left turns. The writers changed >!the entire personality of the main love interest (Cory) from cunning, morally grey and confident to entirely unconfident, stereotypical good guy.!< They also gave Mitch a brilliant redemption arc just to >!have him commit suicide immediately after, and use his death as relatively dull character development for everyone else.!< It also didn't help that the >!entire season was rewritten to include the pandemic, meaning we were re-living a very predictable set of events!< which was not very interesting to watch, and made me cringe a bit throughout. The ending was >!anti-climactic, with a focus on characters that weren't nearly as compelling!<. Edit: almost forgot, the ending of >!Alex losing her mind on haphazard rants on home livestream broadcasts!< didn't really make sense for her character. Maybe I missed something... Idk.

a bit of a salty rant, I suppose. I'm still mad that >!they took an entire season to show Mitch how to be a decent human and then immediately killed him in a moment of depression/hopelessness right after the most hopeful moment he had in months. cheap out to his character, imo.!<"
My Perfect Landing,"I feel like ‘You’ falls into this category. It absolutely didn’t need a 2nd season, and although the 2nd season was good it could have held up as a standalone series."
My Perfect Landing,I agree with you with Squid Game. I think it told an excellent cohesive story that doesn’t require any further explanation. I also thought the same for Alice in Borderland but I’m actually loving season 2 a lot.
My Perfect Landing,Prison break
My Perfect Landing,Goliath. Great season 1 and a really boring season 2
My Perfect Landing,"13 Reasons Why.

The first season ended fairly conclusively. There really wasn’t much more story to tell."
My Perfect Landing,I loved The Bear and am afraid S2 will only damage what could have easily stood on its own as a one-season story arc.

My Perfect Landing,"Dead to Me. I thought ending the first season on the small cliff hanger would have been great. The second season wasn’t bad, but like a lot of shows like it, the ability to suspend yoir disbelief of these people getting away with these things only goes so far. I haven’t seen season 3, but I imagine more of the same."

My Perfect Landing,This kinda goes against the theme of the post but I’m going to give credit to Watchmen. Damon Lindelof insisted on it being a miniseries and told a complete story in one season. HBO asked him to continue but he declined and even said if they want to have someone create their own sequel he would be okay with it. Such a great example of artistic integrity and class
My Perfect Landing,The Handmaid’s Tale. Book ended at end of season 1. Was a perfect ending.
My Perfect Landing,"Once Upon a Time: the first season was terrific, but then it seems like they ran out of ideas."
My Perfect Landing,Broadchurch. Series one was incredible and could stand completely on its own. Later series were convoluted and un-did a lot of what made the original series so compelling.
My Perfect Landing,"This will be unpopular 

24 did not need a 2nd (or any subsequent) seasons.  It was a clever idea and might be the best 1st season of anything ever, but every season afterword was basically a copy."
My Perfect Landing,I’m skeptical that season 2 of 1899 would work or that is needed now when most of the mystery is gone
My Perfect Landing,"I don’t even know if anybody else watched this, but Helix. 

First season was really interesting and had shades of The Thing among other bio-horror. 

Second season took characters from an arctic research base and moved them to an island with a cult run by Stephen Weber. Weird choice."

The first season told the story it set out to tell. I watched the first season when it came out and thought it was fantastically well done and was completely satisfied with how it ended. 

When I saw a second season was coming out I genuinely couldn’t understand why but I gave it a shot. I ended up only watching the first two episodes and never returned."
My Perfect Landing,“13 Reasons Why” will always be my go-to answer.
My Perfect Landing,"Altered Carbon

Season 2 basically just recasts it and turns it into a super hero series. I lasted 1 episode and abandoned it."
My Perfect Landing,The Flight Attendant
My Perfect Landing,"13 Reasons Why. One and done premise that had an ending after season one. 

Same with Designated Survivor. Great fish-out-if-water premise, but where can you go from there?"
My Perfect Landing,Westworld. Season 1 was a near flawless storyline that just got progressively worse as the seasons went on.
My Perfect Landing,Heroes- but we weren't aware that we didn't need a second season until it actually aired.
My Perfect Landing,"Any series with the Kardashians.  In fact, they shouldn’t have had a season 1."
My Perfect Landing,True Detective
My Perfect Landing,"Heroes. They ruined it, and I would rather have it be remembered as a one-season-wonder than what it is."
My Perfect Landing,Twin peaks
My Perfect Landing,Season two of Altered Carbon felt like they dropped the ball plot wise. They just tried to rush everything.
My Perfect Landing,"Westworld.

Not because the later seasons are bad.  I just think if the series stopped at season 1, it would be remembered as an all time great.  Yeah, there were a few loose ends, but overall most of it felt very self contained and complete."
My Perfect Landing,Definitely Squid Game. I’m still interested to see what they’ll do with S2 but S1 ending was almost perfect except for the last moment.
My Perfect Landing,13 reasons why
My Perfect Landing,"Designated Survivor. The first season was interesting to me but come season 2 and 3 and it just felt like it turned into your average bloated cop ""thriller"""
My Perfect Landing,"Homecoming, also while I liked the second season of Killing Eve, it could have ended at season one and I would have been perfectly happy."
My Perfect Landing,Watchmen. Perfect.
My Perfect Landing,The Handmaid’s Tale. They literally told the handmaid’s tale in the first season and everything after that was nonsense that slowly undermined the show’s underlying message.
My Perfect Landing,Sons of Anarchy. The Walking Dead.
My Perfect Landing,Scream queens
My Perfect Landing,Donald Trump’s 🇷🇺-produced Reality TV Presidency.
My Perfect Landing,The Walking Dead
My Perfect Landing,Scream Queens
My Perfect Landing,Altered Carbon.
My Perfect Landing,Manifest - that crap just got weird
My Perfect Landing,"EUPHORIA. It was perfect for a mini series. Season two had some great moments, but overall it was a dumpster fire."
My Perfect Landing,Futureman. Brilliant sci fi comedy first season. And then the rest just isn’t it.
My Perfect Landing,"Death Note

The first season was perfect. The story was intricate, well written and suspenseful throughout it's entirety. The second season though just ruined all of that completely. The story was gettimg overly complicated and the new characters weren't interesting. Also, >!the way Near solves the case at the end felt cheap and unearned. Light should have just won at the end of season 1, or he should have got caught by L.!<"
My Perfect Landing,The Handmaidens Tale: The book the show is based off ends where season 1 ends. Season 2 was just put out on the air because the show had to go on. Leading to contrived plot developments and narrative looping.
My Perfect Landing,Homeland - Would have been a shocking twist and way to end the show
My Perfect Landing,Jessica Jones for sure. Second season was so bad. I hate watched it though. I’m the dummy.
My Perfect Landing,Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt. Seemed to me they wrapped everything up in the first season.
My Perfect Landing,Heroes 100%
My Perfect Landing,Imo Stranger Things. The end of season 1 would have been a great ending and I think it would be cool if the show was more of an anthology exploring different sci-fi topics/monsters
My Perfect Landing,prison break
Get Even,"I still remember some of them saying early on how they were not going to spend any money they made because you never know if the series will keep going, and then afterwards if you will find other work in Hollywood. 

You can't really say it was a bad idea though. "
Get Even,But how much is gunther making
Get Even,What a life that must be. I wouldn't even know what to do with $20M a year
Get Even,"This makes me wonder why Jennifer Aniston does commercials... Like I get why you keep working as an actor, love what you do... But is she really just a huge fan of lotion?"
Get Even,My mind boggles how it is worth so much per year when a blockbuster movie won’t even come close to making that much money! 
Get Even,"Do royalties come naturally as part of an actors contract?

I’m surprised"
Get Even,"Old saying in showbiz. 
 
If you want to be famous, do movies.
If you want to be rich, do TV. 
If you want to be good, do stage."
Get Even,I like hearing Joey is not a struggling actor anymore 
Get Even,"Well, now I know why I barely see any of them on TV or in films anymore. Why bother when you make $20 million a year for work you did 20 years ago."
Get Even,"And I was just thinking to myself, ""Poor Chandler, I never see him in anything any more."" Sounds like he is doing okay. "
Get Even,For shows like Friends on Netflix it would be cool to have a button you could hit to pick a random episode to watch 
Get Even,[deleted]
Get Even,I’ll always love Chandler for his love for Fallout. 
Get Even,"Didn’t they also negotiate it so that everyone on the show makes the same amount? So is everyone making $20m/year?

I remember that being a pretty common TIL that everyone got paid the same for every episode, that was like one of those things people use to explain why the cast is so awesome. "
Get Even,OOH MY GOD ( with janice voice ofc )
Get Even,I feel sorry for the cast of gilligan's island after reading this
Get Even,[deleted]
Get Even,"More than enough money for several lifetimes, assuming you don't blow it on dumb stuff you don't need. In one year. What a life."
Get Even,"Watching it at the moment for the 7th time or so, 4th time since it got released on Netflix a year ago. 
It’s just a great show and great to have it playing on the television as background noise.

We don’t have Parks and Rec, Seinfeld or Everybody loves Raymond on Netflix here, so I’m glad we have Friends :)"
Get Even,Could I be any more loaded.
Get Even,"I watched 2 seasons of Friends. Can't remember why I stopped, but I feel like I should get back into it and finish it. "
Get Even,David Is the one who really made this all happen. He convinced them to stick together and approach their money as a group which gave them more power when doing negotiations. 
Get Even,"And it's still funny…at least to me. I rewatched a couple of episodes yesterday (needed to see the one with Phoebe's Christmas tree miracle), and I LOLed more than once. "
Get Even,I wonder how much the members of The Office brings in a year? 
Get Even,I've seen this exact post before on Reddit. I should try posting in six months and get tons of upvotes
Get Even,"I don't think there's a show like it that has done so well in broadcasting rights, certainly not with the international reach at least. I would imagine The Simpsons might be the only one that could top it, but i don't see other shows doing the same.

Seinfeld and The Office US for instance have a lot of popularity but i don't see it on the same level, IIRC the latter is incredibly popular for Netflix in the US but internationally it hasn't fared as well. Here in the UK it has never even had a proper run on TV and it only just became available to stream here....but on Amazon Video, so the audience is not as big as its Netflix competition.

Saying that i wouldn't be surprised if Fresh Prince earned a few quid for the people involved, it's not mega famous like Friends or The Simpsons but i would have assumed it's still quite big globally."
Get Even,"I don't care how much they make as long as Ross's ""I'm fine"" episode will always be available to watch in HD somewhere."
Get Even,I wish other fields could get a Residuals program like Hollywood has. Gimme 10 cents each month a customer remains subscribed.
Get Even,The writers and composers of the show’s theme song are making a killing every year as well and are probably set for life
Get Even,They make almost 1.7 mil a month . Man!
Get Even,"The dream right there. Work your ass off on something, and it supports you the rest of your life.  
I'm happy for them all."
Get Even,"I’m not surprised, there are many people out there that thinks watching Friends on Netflix is a personality trait."
Get Even,And here I am not having seen more that 4 episodes all together.
Get Even,"I'm awestruck at the idea of 20million once.  But every year...I can't wrap my head around it.  And,  essentially for nothing. Literally royalty payments right? "
Get Even,"Yes..what do you do, dissapear and live comfortably or keep life going.
Matt has starred in many TV shows and was the front for Topgear in the UK for six seasons.
Realistically his wages for that would have hardly moved his bank balance"
Get Even,There is Central Perk merch at a newly opened store in my local mall.
Get Even,Jesus....when do you have enough money? I'm just glad to make it through the month....
Get Even,Imagine making 20 mil a year doing nothing. 
Get Even,"Why did Ross Geller almost drown?

Cause he’s not a good Schwimmer."
Get Even,[deleted]
Get Even,How true is this ?
Get Even,"I see many people criticizing it as being overrated , or inferior to shows like Office. First of all its subjective. 
Secondly, in the non English speaking countries, where English is usually the second language, watching friends is usually their entrance into the English TV shows scene . Because it is easy to the ear and quiet relatable even today . For a show like office , you need to have a little exposure to that sort of sense of humor and if you ask teenagers, it's not as relatable as Joey's one liners or Chandler stuck in the ATM vestibule.
And third, the time that it came out. It isn't that old. I'm from a third world country. My dad watched it in his 20s after he learned English, my elder brother watched it and passed it on to me. A show like Seinfeld would have been during his childhood when he'd have no idea of English. So in that way it has amassed a lot of viewership ."
Get Even,"I don’t see the appeal in the show, but damn it’s amazing at how successful the show is still doing to this day. "
Get Even,This makes me so unbelievably mad
Get Even,"My neighbor was the wardrobe lady for the show, as a  kid with a single mom it was a huge fucking deal when I once got to pick out any pair of nike shoes I wanted since they were donated for free for the show.

I picked the blue penny hardaways btw "
Get Even,but they couldnt keep sunny...
Get Even,All I know is that 'Monica' was on David Dobricks vlog and her house is GOD DAMN! Seems to be doing great.
Get Even,"And Jennifer Anniston is still doing Aveeno adverts hehe.

If I had to guess I'd say she's doing it alot for charity these days with the career she's had."
Get Even,"I never watched Friends myself, but my 16-year-old son watches it on Netflix. We live in Japan by the way. I thought it was odd that he would be interested in a sitcom from the 90s, but I guess it helps him to learn about American culture and hear the language, so it's good. "
Get Even,"God, what I'd do just for half a million once."
Get Even,Could they *be* making any more money?
Get Even,"That’s almost $55,000 every day. One of them could take one single off day and pay off somebody’s student loans, someone’s mortgage, who knows? Geez. It’s crazy just thinking about how much money that is."
Get Even,I've never watched any of it.
Get Even,"Dare I say, the show still holds up "
Get Even,And we see why cable costs are so high. It’s not that they make 2% of earnings it’s that they’re still taking in a billion dollars this far out from when the show ended. Remember you pay even if you don’t watch. 
Get Even,Fuck now I know why they are rarely in anything nowadays. These yearly royalty checks from a 24 old year show command the same or more value as a high-profile Hollywood actors earnings.
Get Even,I met David Schwimmer once while I was working at a high end hotel. Really really nice guy. I know most of our clients are wealthy but I didn't realize just how good he had it lol. It's cool that he was super down to earth.
Get Even,"Twitter fucking hates the show for some reason. I don't know why, after rewatching it recently I think it still holds up."
Get Even,"God damn man, like it’s a pretty good show i get why people like it but jesus, it’s just a sitcom man people go fucking insane for this show. “Oh I’ve watched it all the way through 10 times” Good for you? In my humble opinion Netflix paying all that money to keep Friends and not keep Always Sunny is a crime. "
Get Even,They can definitely afford those New York apartments now.
Get Even,"This article assumes a lot. Syndication deals are complex. The 2% of syndication it claims the cast receives would decrease over time, as it would with all stakeholders. Their share may have been as high as $20 million in first-run syndication but much lower in subsequent packages. With the Netflix deal it’s anybody’s guess as Netflix didn’t exist at the time of their contract writing. That said there’s likely something in their contracts covering the Netflix deal in generic terms. But $20 million annually is probably way off."
Get Even,Jesus no wonder most of them stopped acting (or don’t act very often).... they don’t need to...
Get Even,No wonder they hardly act anymore. Set for life. 
Get Even,I've never seen that show.  Is it any good?
Get Even,Do the guest stars also receive royalties or is it just the main cast?
Get Even,"No wonder they don't have careers, they don't have to work ever again."
Get Even,That must be nice. 
Get Even,"My pop culture class this past semester we briefly talk about laugh tracks and my teacher showed us a YT clips of a friends episodes with the laugh track taken out and frankly, some of the jokes...change."
Get Even,Not to mention that Bright/Kauffman/Crane and Warner Bros are raking in the bulk of that $1B. Residuals for the actors are peanuts.
Get Even,Brady Bunch of the 90’s
Get Even,Jeez who needs $20 mil a year?
Get Even,That’s fucking absurd 
Get Even,"I am not a hater, but I seriously have no clue how this show is so popular.  It's right in my era, and I didn't care for it.  I went back and tried to watch it......and it was worse.  Didn't age well.  

How much of this is international?  I simply can't understand the appeal much less these staggering numbers.  "
Get Even,Another reason Matt Leblanc never have to work again. 
Get Even,"Just curious, what is it about the show that everybody likes? I’ve been wanting to get into it but I still haven’t finished HIMYM, but I keep hearing that FRIENDS is just a great comedy with relatable characters, as a dude in his mid 20s should I give it a shot? "
Get Even,"there's talk about the actors; what about writers, directors, editors, etc.????????????????????????????????? do they get any love with these long term deals?"
Get Even,How does it still make money
Get Even,Could we petition the cast of friends to finance student debt cancellation? 
Get Even,Who the fuck is still watching this. Lmao.
Get Even,God knows why the show was boring and rubbish not even funny. 
Get Even,Possibly the most overrated TV show of all time. 
Get Even,And it’s not even a good show...
Get Even,This show is not funny nor entertaining 
Get Even,"Those numbers are probably made-up.  Seinfeld would have comparable residual history, and it is not reportedly making anything like that.  Netflix pays one-tenth that for exclusive streaming access.

https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/comedy/news/seinfeld-is-laughing-all-the-way-to-the-bank-tv-show-generates-31bn-in-repeat-fees-since-final-8558519.html

Part of the confusion is this article, that gave the impression that the series earned $1b/year, rather than over a four-year period.  US distribution rights during much of the last decade were only $30m/ year.

https://web.archive.org/web/20120119160918/http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117925752.html?cs=1&s=h&p=0

Edit: even if you include international distribution, that's not going to account for 5X higher residuals.  Royalties and ad revenue are lower in international countries."
Get Even,[deleted]
Get Even,"Friends is an ok tv show, but I still don’t understand why people like it so much."
Get Even,Best tv show of all time imo.
Get Even,Just a terrible show.
Get Even,Am I the only one that doesn’t get the hype around this show? I grew up when it was on TV and I just never found it funny. Same with The Office 
Get Even,"Props to all the cast members who still act. They have no financial reason to do so, so you can tell they enjoy their career path."
Get Even,I find it so bizarre people make that much money. Its real and so unrealistic that my poverty seems unreal as well.... Like are most of us really that fucken poor that 20 million is common for them and a dream to us?
Get Even,Miss that show.
Get Even,Unpopular opinion: The show Friends is good.
Get Even,Because it's timeless classic
Get Even,"It's crazy how a group of no-name actors basically hit the lotto by being on this show. And really they could've used any group of 6 young white people and it would've been the same show.

That's crazy."
Get Even,I bet Lisa Kudrow is super happy she got fired from/replaced on Frasier. 
Get Even,Oh good... I was worried about them being broke...🙄
Get Even,[deleted]
Get Even,Who is watching all these rerun episodes?  Russian bots?
Get Even,Wow... for a show that’s not even good.
Transformers: War For Cybertron Trilogy,"Huh. Not going were I expected it to. I figured most of this arc would be the war on Earth, then the weird galactic stuff like the Quintessons would show up in part 3. Now Earth must be part 3 based on the name?

Looks like they're sticking a lot closer to the the IDW version of Galvatron, wonder if that means Hot Rod is showing up.  

I enjoyed part 1 a lot more than I expected. I hope it's successful enough they spin it off into a full show."
Transformers: War For Cybertron Trilogy,"Part 1 was okay, but I feel like the voice acting and dialogue weren't great. And I would have liked a lot more of the backstory they kept referencing to actually be explained.

Like the decepticons were oppressed slaves and the autobots were wealthy elites sure that makes sense. But then megatron was fighting with prime magus and optimus prime against someone, was that other autobots in a slave rebellion that abolitionist autobots supported them in? Or were all autobots and decepticons fighting against some third party? After that megatron was fighting against optimus and magus despite them previously being allies, what happened to cause this? Did the decepticons after winning their freedom decide to enslave all the autobots in return, or was it more complex than that? They kept on referencing this past, but didn't provide enough detail to really work it out."
Transformers: War For Cybertron Trilogy,I wish they would’ve got the original actors
Transformers: War For Cybertron Trilogy,"I actually feel like the backstory stuff from part 1 would have made a better series. Seeing Megatron rise up as the hero of an enslaved population would have been really cool. They could have made him a really interesting character, but unfortunately they had him go full moustache twirling villain too quickly."
Transformers: War For Cybertron Trilogy,"I know we've seen it in the comics before, but is this the first time we've seen Megatron and Galvatron interact together on-screen?"
Transformers: War For Cybertron Trilogy,"honestly this show needs more episodes.

it would give things way more time to develop
Instead of everything feeling rushed"
Transformers: War For Cybertron Trilogy,"Tried the first season, couldn't get past how melodramatic the writing was. It's about Robots that turn into cars and trucks and they're trying to paint it like it's some edgy war drama, like calm the fuck down."
Transformers: War For Cybertron Trilogy,why does the animation look so cheap ?
Transformers: War For Cybertron Trilogy,"If you're interested in that, this show is heavily influenced by the IDW comics continuity, especially the early ""-ations"" era (Infiltration/Escalation/Devastation). 

It's not technically canon to this show, but the 4 Part [Megatron Origins](https://tfwiki.net/wiki/The_Transformers:_Megatron_Origin) series explains most of the backstory. The short version:

The Autobots were the elite intellectual ruling class on Cybertron, and Decepticons were the slave/worker class - miners, laborers, factory workers, etc. Eventually Megatron leads them in a revolt and overthrows society. Instead of leading to a new bright future of equality for Cybertron he becomes a genocidal dictator intent on wiping out every Autobot in existence and ruling over everything. 

Interesting take on the war, it gives the Decepticons realistic motivations while keeping them the baddies. IDW did an amazing job with the series all around."
Transformers: War For Cybertron Trilogy,"Even though it's not related except for the similar name, the War for Cybertron games had a great cast that (quite a few of the original ones if i remember correctly) and they all meshed well in-game."
Transformers: War For Cybertron Trilogy,"a lot of them have died over the years.

starscream (chris latta), jazz (scatman crothers), cliffjumper (casey kasem), ratchet (don messnick), blaster (buster jones). almost all the movie voice actors are now dead, but many of their tv series replacements still are kicking."
Transformers: War For Cybertron Trilogy,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V1vJVlYoar8
Transformers: War For Cybertron Trilogy,robot jesus died for our sins. how dare you insult his memory!
Transformers: War For Cybertron Trilogy,Big whoop. He comes back
Transformers: War For Cybertron Trilogy,"*Trypticon if you can hear me, know that this is not a rescue mission!*"
Transformers: War For Cybertron Trilogy,"As a fan of Transformers: Prime as well as the War for cybertron & Fall of cryberton games, I AM FUCKING HYPED."
Transformers: War For Cybertron Trilogy,"This is an example of when cheap-ish 3D animation is appropriate/effective. 

Transformers is best when humans aren't involved, IMO. The Phase Two IDW comics were amazing.

I wonder how many people will get triggered by this being called ""anime"" (Polygon Pictures in Japan)."
Transformers: War For Cybertron Trilogy,"> no human bs

> no Bayformers bs

Doing god’s work, Netflix."
Transformers: War For Cybertron Trilogy,"Oh shit that looked like Impactor, the Wreckers showing up would be unreal"
Transformers: War For Cybertron Trilogy,Oh damn. These looks good. War for Cybertron is some of best transformers content there is.
Transformers: War For Cybertron Trilogy,"Optimus - ""Purple man bad"""
Transformers: War For Cybertron Trilogy,THE L I P S
Transformers: War For Cybertron Trilogy,Will they also bring the Dinobots into these?  They were the best part of Fall of Cybertron.
Transformers: War For Cybertron Trilogy,Optimum Price looks dope
Transformers: War For Cybertron Trilogy,Can someone educate me on the lore pls. I always thought transformers came to earth cause their homeplanet got destroyed which I assume is cybertron. How then can they already transform to vehicles from earth?
Transformers: War For Cybertron Trilogy,"No Peter Cullen, no deal."
Transformers: War For Cybertron Trilogy,Loved the games with this style. Very happy to not have another crash land on earth story.
Transformers: War For Cybertron Trilogy,I like is so far but I not a fan of the way the voices sound computerized. Maybe tone it down like 40% and it would sound great
Transformers: War For Cybertron Trilogy,“YOU GOT THE TOUCH! YOU GOT THE POWERRRRRRRRRRRRR!!!!! YEAH!!”
Transformers: War For Cybertron Trilogy,"Not a huge Transformers fan myself, but the fact that Rooster Teeth Animation is doing this has really peaked my interest. Visually, this looks like their best show yet!"
Transformers: War For Cybertron Trilogy,Did anyone see Hot Rod?! I need OG Hot Rod in this.
Transformers: War For Cybertron Trilogy,I'm interested. Hope they incorporate the original theme and background music somehow.
Transformers: War For Cybertron Trilogy,That's a lot of dust.
Transformers: War For Cybertron Trilogy,"Damn you ""Coming Soon""!!!"
Transformers: War For Cybertron Trilogy,Just don’t kill Prime and we good
Transformers: War For Cybertron Trilogy,Kinda wished the designs were more like the games since this is before they adapted their forms to Earth vehicles.
Transformers: War For Cybertron Trilogy,"oh damn didnt know this was a thing, and one of the few times CGI animation doesnt look bad

tho real dissappointing not hearing Peter Cullen or Frank Welker"
Transformers: War For Cybertron Trilogy,The voice acting is weird
Transformers: War For Cybertron Trilogy,Beast Wars remake when?
Transformers: War For Cybertron Trilogy,My expectations are pretty low judging by the Prime Wars roosterteeth show.
Transformers: War For Cybertron Trilogy,I'm in
Transformers: War For Cybertron Trilogy,[Cybertron needs Strength - Cybertron needs Freedom!](https://youtu.be/ZsISWO4INTo?t=63)
Transformers: War For Cybertron Trilogy,As a fan of transformers my entire life...i dont know how to feel. Im conflicted
Transformers: War For Cybertron Trilogy,There are so many different transformers series.
Transformers: War For Cybertron Trilogy,"The topic is good but I'm not a fan of this type of animation.

Also, they could've at least tried to find someone who sounds like Peter Cullen. Prime just sounds wrong."
Transformers: War For Cybertron Trilogy,"Looks good, but I'm gonna wait until all three parts are available to watch it."
Transformers: War For Cybertron Trilogy,"Not feeling Prime's voice, otherwise looks good"
Transformers: War For Cybertron Trilogy,Any release date?
Transformers: War For Cybertron Trilogy,"So when they say ""War for Cybertron Trilogy: Siege"", what exactly does that mean?  3 seasons?  3 feature length episodes in 1 season?"
Transformers: War For Cybertron Trilogy,"Inject some Omega Supreme and Combaticons into my veins.

I will also take some Soundwave and his cassettes too."
Transformers: War For Cybertron Trilogy,I like the art style but that animation is weak. Giant robots should have some weight to them.
Transformers: War For Cybertron Trilogy,No Peter Cullen or Frank Welker. Sorry. Will not watch.
Transformers: War For Cybertron Trilogy,"This series _must have_:

[Metroplex heeds the call of the Last Prime](https://youtu.be/3sCnDvTNrL8)"
Transformers: War For Cybertron Trilogy,"Wait wait wait, why are they transforming into human vehicles of they haven't been to Earth yet?"
Transformers: War For Cybertron Trilogy,Any chance of ever getting a Beast Wars reboot or sequel? Maybe with plenty of dark themes for the fans who watched during the original airing.
Transformers: War For Cybertron Trilogy,"The voice acting sounds like shit, it's like fan movie stuff."
Transformers: War For Cybertron Trilogy,"Wait, anime? I know Transformer has their own Japanese anime but this is American style design and storyline, shouldnt it be a cartoon?"
Transformers: War For Cybertron Trilogy,The animation looks godawful :(
Transformers: War For Cybertron Trilogy,Christ that was horrible..
Transformers: War For Cybertron Trilogy,"Damn, this looks fixing awesome. When's it due out? I only saw a ""coming soon"""
Transformers: War For Cybertron Trilogy,I fucking dig the animation
Transformers: War For Cybertron Trilogy,Cell shading must die.
Transformers: War For Cybertron Trilogy,I wish they'd stop making transformers stuff and move on to a new idea or franchise.
Transformers: War For Cybertron Trilogy,"*Despite your great power, you failed to destroy the Autobots. You failed ME. Henceforth, your chassis will be altered and redesigned to MY specifications.*"
Transformers: War For Cybertron Trilogy,Those games...What I would give for another one.
Transformers: War For Cybertron Trilogy,"I loved the Cybertron games. They were amazing. Look at my username, I need this in my life."
Transformers: War For Cybertron Trilogy,[deleted]
Transformers: War For Cybertron Trilogy,"To be fair, Transformers have multiple anime series in Japan. So, I'm more okay with it than anything else that Netflix label anime that isn't."
Transformers: War For Cybertron Trilogy,"Curiously, what makes it cheap 3D?"
Transformers: War For Cybertron Trilogy,"The models and everything are great, but the animation feels like it could have more emotions and drama to it. I haven't watched since beast wars, is this the new normal? Am i being a jerk here?"
Transformers: War For Cybertron Trilogy,When are we gonna get a full netflix adaptation of idw phase 2 man. I want it so bad.
Transformers: War For Cybertron Trilogy,It honestly looks incredible
Transformers: War For Cybertron Trilogy,I like 3/5s of bayformers ☹
Transformers: War For Cybertron Trilogy,"This is based on a toyline from last year which had Impactor - so, yes, I'd say it's a good bet he'll be here, but maybe not along with the other Wreckers."
Transformers: War For Cybertron Trilogy,Stupid sexy Megatron.
Transformers: War For Cybertron Trilogy,"There are no toys for them in the first two years of the line so probably not, or at least they won't be in it much."
Transformers: War For Cybertron Trilogy,The Optimus Price is Right.
Transformers: War For Cybertron Trilogy,"Those are their Cybertronian forms but they just look very close to their Earth forms. Depending on the continuity, sometimes they look very close to their Earth forms or they're completely alien. It's a stylistic choice. But yes, you're right about them coming to Earth due to their planet being destroyed."
Transformers: War For Cybertron Trilogy,"What's shown is actually their cybertronian forms from the wfc siege toyline of last year, this year's series is a continuation of that called earthrise where they actually get earth modes. Their forms just really look earth like for aesthetics it seems like Optimus looking like a regular truck and Megatron like a regular tank but in earthrise they become the real earth counterparts of those alternate modes"
Transformers: War For Cybertron Trilogy,I was wondering why Optimus sounded weird. Shame he's not doing the voice
Transformers: War For Cybertron Trilogy,"Same. Was waiting to hear ""Autobots, roll out,"" in his voice. Nope. 

Going to be hard to watch it without at least Prime sounding like the OG series."
Transformers: War For Cybertron Trilogy,"I'm pretty sure RT is just producing it, because that animation is definitely Polygon Pictures animation."
Transformers: War For Cybertron Trilogy,*piqued
Transformers: War For Cybertron Trilogy,RT have just inherited it. I think they are serving as producers on a smallish scale
Transformers: War For Cybertron Trilogy,Wait really? When did they announce that?
Transformers: War For Cybertron Trilogy,"Siege doesn't have a Hot Rod toy, and Earthrise doesn't have one either(but there are probably quite a few figures that haven't been announced yet). But Siege did have a Hot Shot figure."
Transformers: War For Cybertron Trilogy,Fuck Hot Rod.
Transformers: War For Cybertron Trilogy,The toys for the second season are already shipping and there's a Prime toy so he'll be fine...
Transformers: War For Cybertron Trilogy,"Pretty much the way the toyline which this series is based off of is a trilogy: 2018-2019 had Siege which is the characters we are seeing here on Cybertron with Cybertronian alt-modes, and right now we have Earthrise, which are Transformers appearing on Earth with their Earthbased vehicle modes. There's also going to be a currently unannounced third 'season' of toys next year, I think."
Transformers: War For Cybertron Trilogy,"It’s based on the WFC Siege toys. Most of the toys are alienish versions of what the bots normally turn into if they usually had Earth modes, besides the Seekers, who turn into the Cybertronian Tetrajet form they had in G1"
Transformers: War For Cybertron Trilogy,"It looks like it's 12fps in some places and 60fps in others, hopefully they fix that before release."
Transformers: War For Cybertron Trilogy,Such a good segment.
Transformers: War For Cybertron Trilogy,"When I saw the ending matching the intro to beast wars, I lost my mind. That was my favorite show as a kid and I still want that game bad!"
Transformers: War For Cybertron Trilogy,Grimlock and the Combaticons were amazing
Transformers: War For Cybertron Trilogy,Energon was straight up an anime. It’s just saving on work because there’s two companies that own the toy line.
Transformers: War For Cybertron Trilogy,"It's just relative to nicer 3D animation like in Pixar movies. This specific school of 3D animation styles/techniques used for anime recently (e.g. Netflix's Ghost in the Shell) always looks very cheap in comparison (IMO). 

Anime (or animated TV in general) already has to work hard to hit deadlines so they've developed a lot of cost/time-saving techniques like limited motion, lower frame rates, flashbacks, close-ups, and static/panning shots. 3DCG animation has a bigger upfront cost in creating assets, but then it can be easier/less labor intensive to achieve all the shots you want just by manipulating  those assets rather than hand-drawing every frame (2D animation). That said, it still applies the same cost-cutting measures so you might notice less fluid action sequences, fewer objects in motion, less detail or detail cleverly avoided, etc. In the trailer you can see examples of this with robots just staring off into the distance (nothing is moving), Optimus' transform/cartwheel happening very quickly, limited range of motion, repeat assets, blurred backgrounds, etc. To me, it works here because the characters, buildings, designs in general are more robotic, angular, alien/foreign, stoic, etc. which pair well with such techniques (unlike 3D human models which can trigger uncanny valley reactions).

I could just be wrong about the budget, though. It's possible to spend a lot of money and have something look relatively underwhelming. However, I'll reiterate that I think this trailer looks pretty good."
Transformers: War For Cybertron Trilogy,"Go watch the shitty ones if you want emotions and stuff.

This is very true to the games"
Transformers: War For Cybertron Trilogy,"Ew.  Not a single transformer design was good.

Not one.  And the humans all sucked.

And they managed to fuck up the Dinobots"
Transformers: War For Cybertron Trilogy,"Well Springer was part of that line too, Ultra Magnus is here too and he's somewhat associated with the Wreckers whether as a member or just someone that works with them a lot so like there's 3 characters that could be used for a Wreckers team so far."
Transformers: War For Cybertron Trilogy,Based on the War for Cybertron games initially
Meet the Parents,That Fockers line was begging for a slip up.
Meet the Parents,"I could sit and listen to De Niro say ""Putin's Little Bitch"" all night."
Meet the Parents,Hats off to the makeup department for DeNiro/Mueller! That was spot-on!
Meet the Parents,"Say what you want about the bad jokes in the second half, I still loved it. Did not see De Niro coming"
Meet the Parents,"Loved it!  My favorite line was ""I toss and turn in my shoe box all night wondering what the FBI will do next"". The only thing missing was Alec Baldwin as Pinocchio Trump but it was still comic gold! 
The truth is funnier than the fiction hopefully Pinocchio Trump and his gang can be sent to prison for life https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PChiglz68FM﻿"
Meet the Parents,"I have nipples, can you milk me?"
Meet the Parents,The nipple joke was pretty forced
Meet the Parents,"Maybe not the best cold open ever, but it certainly had me smiling all through it. As soon as Stiller came on screen I got super excited."
Meet the Parents,Mirror?
Meet the Parents,The show has really gotten bad over the last several years and it just keeps going further down hill. Sad. 
Meet the Parents,"Why do live audiences carry on those dragged on screams and round of applause when someone the recognize is unexpectedly in front of them?

We get it, now let them do what they came here to do. Robert De Niro shouldn't have to stand there for 25 seconds waiting to start."
Meet the Parents,"It was comic gold! Jeff Sessions was hilarious! ""I toss and turn in my shoe box all night wondering what the FBI will do next"". "
Meet the Parents,"It really was. You could see it coming from a mile away and even if it were written in and delivered better... why? Just because it resembles the lie detector part of meet the parents just a bit? It's so unnecessary it was almost cringey.

I feel like that whole part with De Niro as Mueller fell short. I love Ben Stiller as dopey ass-kisser Cohen though, that was pretty much perfect casting once again this season. And Mckinnon's Jeff Sessions is always hilarious. Idk where they should have went with the second half, but I didn't really care much for that.

And another line that I found somewhat forced was De Niro saying that ""we're gonna get all you fockers!"" line, like calm down we get it you guys make those parents movies."
Meet the Parents,[mirror](https://streamable.com/117jb)
Meet the Parents,"The bigger the cameo, the bigger the reception. It's to show appreciation. Nasim Pedrad made a small appearance and got 1-2 screams (tops) of recognition."
Meet the Parents,"Well, deniro really pulled off the Mueller look. "
Meet the Parents,"I was optimistic, until I realized it was going to be a whole sketch of Meet The Parents references, not just one that briefly mentions it and moves on. "
Meet the Parents,I think they needed the nipples bit in order to pull off the fockers line.  Otherwise some people (esp. those that complain to the FCC) will miss the reference.
Meet the Parents,"> And another line that I found somewhat forced was De Niro saying that ""we're gonna get all you fockers!"" line, like calm down we get it you guys make those parents movies.

Had that been the only meet the parents series reference I would have been fine with it"
Meet the Parents,"I have nipples, can you milk me?"
Meet the Parents,"You oughta know, sweetie"
Meet the Parents,"Paulie had the greatest comedic timing on the entire show, he was a spot on throwback to vaudeville, just perfect"
Meet the Parents,Thanks. Now I have to watch the whole series again.
Meet the Parents,The guy was an interior decorator!
Meet the Parents,"The Sorpanos showed that these gangsters are not the cool and honourable mafiso they want to be seen as. They’re ass-kissers, bullies, cowards — but you’ll still find Tony Soprano used as an example of ‘real men’ in memes!"
Meet the Parents,NOBODYS GOT AIDS!! I don’t wanna hear that word in here again.
Meet the Parents,"Paulie has every right to be nervous, that scene where Tony curb stomps the guy who creeps on Meadow. Oof, Madone!"
Meet the Parents,Chrissy...he's fucked up!
Meet the Parents,It's may ham!
Meet the Parents,"Great television show of all time.  
whaddya hear whaddya say!"
Meet the Parents,[removed]
Meet the Parents,That kid was the worst character
Meet the Parents,[deleted]  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^0.1511
Meet the Parents,I love how Paulie just screams his name whenever he ends a conversation
Meet the Parents,What? We're bustin' balls here!
Meet the Parents,I knew *that* was comin’!
Meet the Parents,His house looked like shit
Meet the Parents,Whateva happened to Gary Coopa?
Meet the Parents,"If he was a real man, he'd having the makings of a varsity athlete."
Meet the Parents,This is why I love the Sopranos. It's a dark comedy about these lame baby boomers who have extremely poor impulse control.
Meet the Parents,"Well, this isn’t Tony in this scene, it’s Paulie, who is absolutely an ass kisser and a bully. 

And while I agree that Tony is an absolute scumbag, to pretend he doesn’t have considerable machismo and projects an imposing presence is missing a lot of the point of the show. 


It’s toxic masculinity for sure but it is a sort of “traditional,” masculinity. It’s frequently shown to be juxtaposed with characters like AJ or Artie. Tony *is* a tough fucker. But that’s not necessarily a good thing.


Edit: the show actively pushes this too, it’s not subtle about it at all. There is literally a scene where Tony bursts into a (naked) politician’s bedroom and whips him with a belt for sleeping with his *former* mistress. The guy swings his dick around in everyone’s face constantly."
Meet the Parents,"I fucking love this show. In this 1 minute clip, David Chase says what other shows take an entire episode to say.

For example, I'm watching 'Snowfall' right now and holy fuck, the pace makes me want to rip my hair out. I like John Singleton as much as the next guy but good god. 

Yes, I get that Franklin is grown up and business savvy. I get that Leon is as gangsta as they come and is at ends with Franklin. I get that Alton was a Black Panther, drug addict trying to redeem himself. They just beat you over the head with these plot lines for several episodes when all you needed was 2-3 minutes to get the point across and then move onto something more interesting or further develop these characters and explore something. I really enjoyed Season 1 and 2 but after that, it feels like a show where they didn't realize they were going to get renewed and are just retreading old ground over and over again because they don't know what else to do."
Meet the Parents,"> Tony Soprano used as an example of ‘real men’ in memes

Haven't seen a single example of this since the rise of the internet, but since people unironically use Ron Swanson in the same way even though he's a blatant caricature even in the actor's eyes, I wouldn't find it surprising at all."
Meet the Parents,"> but you’ll still find Tony Soprano used as an example of ‘real men’ in memes!

Are memes supposed to be taken seriously?"
Meet the Parents,"Don't they have medicine they're supposted to take, these assholes?"
Meet the Parents,Why don't you get outta here before I shove your quotation book up your fat fuckin' ass!
Meet the Parents,You made an alt account to post this? Lmao
Meet the Parents,"Listen to him, he knows everything!"
Meet the Parents,He’s definitely not likable but he does give a pretty good outsider’s perspective on how traumatic it would be to be around excessive violence
Meet the Parents,He was objectively the most decent recurring character on the entire show. He was cringe but overall a good guy. Glad he eventually got away from Meadow and her crazy ass family.
Meet the Parents,Better than Meadow’s other boyfriend that kid really sucked
Meet the Parents,Don’t make me pull rank on you kid!
Meet the Parents,"My favorite thing is that Tony does that whole rant at least twice in the series. It's as if he has the routine memorized, like Sil's Godfather homage. Very New Jersey fatha thing. ""He's talking about Gary Cooper again..."""
Meet the Parents,"He was gay, Gary Cooper?"
Meet the Parents,"I know it’s Paulie, just pointing out Tony the main character is still hero worshiped. And you right, on the surface Tony is a tough guy — but viewers know he’s a insecure guy with mother issues."
Meet the Parents,Fuckin’ intanet
Meet the Parents,Poor you
Meet the Parents,Noah or Jackie Junior?
Meet the Parents,"""Life's too short Chrissy, you can't waste it fighting with your friends.  Look what happened last night, someone could have gotten hurt for Christ's sakes.""  (said after they murdered an innocent waiter over a tip)"
Meet the Parents,You're lucky i don't punch your fucking lights out!
Meet the Parents,"Catching, not pitching?!"
Meet the Parents,">	but viewers know he’s a insecure guy with mother issues.

He definitely is, and I think your overall point still rings true that the Sopranos does a great job showing how unglamorous the mafia really is…

but while the other people in Tony’s crew are mostly insecure and bullies, I personally think Tony is a genuinely intimidating/manipulative/unhinged motherfucker due to “this thing of ours” that he grew up around. He’s got a genuine foothold in the North Jersey area. So much so he’s got cops in his back pocket, hooked up with a corporate lawyer who was trying to buy properties he owned, got some random stranger to take off his hat simply by staring him down, killed a made man simply for killing a horse/hooker (depending on interpretation), etc. The other guys are insecure, but Tony’s a ticking time bomb"
Meet the Parents,[deleted]
Meet the Parents,"Jamal Ginzburg, the Hasidic homeboy."
Meet the Parents,social club? He’s gotta go!
Meet the Parents,"Exactly. He is absolutely a tough guy. By pretty much any definition. So if that’s your perception of what manliness is, and it is to a lot of people, Tony *is* going to epitomise it in many ways. 


He’s a hulking brute who is capable of literally beating people to death with his bare hands. He curb stomps a man in the middle of a restaurant while holding another man at gunpoint for making crude remarks towards his daughter. 


He is not a good person, nor hero. But if your idea of manly is someone you’d be terrified to fuck with… he ticks that box. Coward he ain’t."
Meet the Parents,"> Tony is a genuinely intimidating/manipulative/unhinged motherfucker due to “this thing of ours” that he grew up around. He’s got a genuine foothold in the North Jersey area

Another layer to what you’re saying here is that Tony also shows flexibility in how he gets what he wants which adds to his intimidation and scary aura. One of the episodes, he simply harassed a guy to return his deposit over a beach house without ever resorting to physical violence just by blasting music and having enough money to pay off fines indefinitely."
Meet the Parents,Noah. Fucking hated that prick
Meet the Parents,">He curb stomps a man in the middle of a restaurant while holding another man at gunpoint for making crude remarks towards his daughter. 

I don't know that that's an example of him not being a coward, both the gun and his station protect him from any reprisals."
Meet the Parents,"No, it literally does not, they end up at war. Not over that exclusively but it was a factor. And you think he couldn’t beat the shit out of Butchie if he wanted? He wasn’t part of it. The gun was telling him not to even try intervene. 


But I wasn’t using that as an example of him not being a coward, just that he is clearly not someone you fuck with. He went *that far* with a made man from another family."
Meet the Parents,"Just started watching this and absolutely LOVED it, it’s definitely not a typical superhero show"
Meet the Parents,"In case anyone is wondering, the song is “Something for Your Mind” by Superorganism, and yes that is the actual band appearing in the show."
Meet the Parents,I wish some of the characters from Legion would pop up in Loki.  The production design for the TVA seems heavily inspired by Legion.
Meet the Parents,It's incredible how fast this series exited the collective mind. Nobody seems to talk about it.
Meet the Parents,I found Switch exceptionally attractive.  Shame her role basically disappeared after the first couple of episodes of that season.
Meet the Parents,I wish the whole season had been a bit more inspired like this.
Meet the Parents,Well that was odd
Meet the Parents,Love this show and how absolutely trippy and fucked up it was willing to get to tell its story.
Meet the Parents,Best Marvel television show.
Meet the Parents,I watched it years ago with the closed captioning on and thought the word `SUPERORGANISM` was explaining the nature Legion’s relationship with his followers.
Meet the Parents,I really like this scence and a lot of the first half of season 3. I think the second of the season really drags
Meet the Parents,It appeared on Fifa soundtrack the same year this season came out so when they played it on the show I literally did the Leo DiCaprio pointing at the tv meme ha
Meet the Parents,"Their first album was my most listened to of 2018, I even went and saw them live. (One of the weirdest concerts I’ve ever seen btw) Try as I might though, I just really couldn’t get into their new album World Wide Pop."
Meet the Parents,"WOW I didn’t realise it was also the actual band, damn"
Meet the Parents,Thought it was them
Meet the Parents,"If nothing else, everybody knows MCU's X-Men is coming eventually. There's zero reason they couldn't involve some of the cast into the films/tv shows that follow."
Meet the Parents,"My family talks about it all the time. The third season especially clicked really well with us. I've never read marvel comics, so I was completely blown away by >!David being the son of Charles Xavier!<. I think that there's just so much media that when a show ends, the people who watched it will talk about it, but it doesn't leave certain circles. Like Atlanta, another FX show. Very satisfying ending, to me. Great series. But I haven't seen anyone mention it online since it ended."
Meet the Parents,Is it still good?
Meet the Parents,There was a 3d season?
Meet the Parents,"Dan Stevens is wonderful in everything.  Would love to see him in the MCU, even if he doesn't play David."
Meet the Parents,Needs a full series Blue Ray release.
Meet the Parents,It is an absolute masterpiece of anachronisms. I loved it.
Meet the Parents,Yeah. But it does end up having more style than substance.
Meet the Parents,"A shorter answer than you're getting is that, yes it's worth watching. Super weird, very memorable, extremely creative."
Meet the Parents,And every now and then we hear Syd saying: *David*
Meet the Parents,I'd just like to see him more often in general
Meet the Parents,Maybe the most style over substance show I’ve ever seen - especially how it resolved - but I really enjoyed it.
Meet the Parents,"I watched him in a German film, I’m your Man, and he is just as good in another language!"
Meet the Parents,Yup.
Meet the Parents,"Benjamin and Jake Sisko.  Commander/Captain Sisko consistently found time to be a loving and attentive father even while leading a war effort, and we got to watch Jake grow into a complex and thriving young man (and old man in one episode) as a result."
Sing On! Spain,What a mess. It still doesn't really explain how they're going to verify households.
Sing On! Spain,"considering that the basic plan in Canada is $16.49 for 2 simultaneous streams, the additional profile is not really much of a discount if they want to get 2 additional accounts.  

and do this additional account count into the number of simultaneous stream of the main account? because that's such a huge markup for no additional streaming."
Sing On! Spain,"Easy decision to cancel based on these changes.

I’m sure Netflix has a team of analysts working over how this will be a net profit on the macro level, but it’s only made me re-evaluate how much I use the service (rarely, these days) and whether it’s worth the higher price (it ain’t).

Probably would have kept my subscription running indefinitely without this change. Now they get nothing."
Sing On! Spain,They need to make a video explaining this because I am lost. I pay $6.77 CAD for ads but am at my mom's house watching. Will I be blocked when I go back home?
Sing On! Spain,"Just cancel it.  Don’t even question it or say I will do it later, just cancel now.  Speak with your wallet.  They only speak in the language of money. 

It doesn’t matter if there is ten shows you still want to watch.  Let them know you don’t support this, tell your friends and family not to support it.  Just cancel your subscription now."
Sing On! Spain,"Netflix: And so it begins 

Subscribers: No, now it ends"
Sing On! Spain,"Spaniard here, many people is cancelling subscription. They used to have Netflix because they could share the cost, Netflix at full price it is not worth it. How dumb it is to force you in a 4 device plan to have 4K? Now you even can't share it.

Personally I just use Netflix for some documentaries we watch after dinner. For TV Shows we use HBO which offers a much higher quality content. I share my subscription to my parents and sister, and my sister shares HBO in exchange.

If Netflix blocks that ability, maybe I will just switch to the 1080p plan."
Sing On! Spain,I hope they lose so many subscribers
Sing On! Spain,"Ok Canada. 1 screen $11. 2 screens $17. 4 screens $21.
So right now those extra screens do not have to be in same house. So if you have 4 stream account and have 4 ppl in family and all use phones to watch and all have own profiles so as to not mess with each others lists. If you watch at work, on transit, when you out to kill time. How is netflix going to deal with this?
Will you suddenly be charged more for using your own 4 stream account if everyone streaming from all over the city while they go about normal activities. I have doubts this will work the way they want."
Sing On! Spain,I'm in Portugal and I'll be canceling Netflix. They won't be seeing any more money from me if I can't share my account.
Sing On! Spain,"This is gonna blow back in their face. This won't make them money, it's going to lose them money, a lot of it."
Sing On! Spain,I'm sure this will go over well /s
Sing On! Spain,Ive got a laptop and an HDMI cable. I dont even need to download shows to watch them.
Sing On! Spain,If Disney+ and Prime continue to allow password sharing then I expect Netflix won't be the market leader in the next 5-10 years. I just cancelled my subscription. I'll find another way to watch Seinfeld.
Sing On! Spain,Well. I canceled my account. And I was with them since the beginning. They are just another fucking cable company at this point.
Sing On! Spain,I'll finally get to cancel Netflix without fearing offending my moochers :D
Sing On! Spain,So if my mother lives in the Us and i Live in spain im basically fucked?
Sing On! Spain,"Netflix if you're reading this, I'm not gonna just cancel one account but two 🤡🤡"
Sing On! Spain,"I think it’s great that streaming services are making it easier to determine which ones are worth cancelling and contribute nothing to my life

See ya Netflix"
Sing On! Spain,We don’t share our account with anyone outside our household but Netflix has been on the chopping block for us because we’re tired of finding a show only for it to be axed after one season. It’s probably going to get dropped this month or the next at the latest and we’ll just stick with Prime
Sing On! Spain,Bye bye Netflix. Just canceled my subscription today.
Sing On! Spain,"You can't get a Basic account that streams over 720p? Netflix looking about as high-tech as cable tv with that one, bit shameful in 2023."
Sing On! Spain,I want to see 2023 Q2 and Q3 numbers so badly!!!
Sing On! Spain,"Canada,  you have to rebel like us rowdy Americans,  we got rid of that shit quick."
Sing On! Spain,How to cancel: https://help.netflix.com/en/node/407
Sing On! Spain, I’ll be canceling if this hits US. Screw that when my family lives in multiple places. How stupid and greedy.
Sing On! Spain,"Not renewing nice shows.
Not sharing accounts.

Change the freaking name to Notflix already and fuck off."
Sing On! Spain,"When I heard they were initial planning on doing this last year, I dropped Netflix. Haven't looked back."
Sing On! Spain,Netflix going down as fast as  my anchor is going under the sea
Sing On! Spain,"All I know is that if my access gets blocked even once I’m cancelling immediately. There’s ways to watch this shot for free, guys."
Sing On! Spain,Aaaaaaaand unsubscribe.
Sing On! Spain,"Hi Disney+, you seem more attractive than Netflix by leagues."
Sing On! Spain,"I hope it's going to be with the rules they ""leaked"" several days ago. If I just need  to visit my parents every 31 days and login to their wifi, then I run no risk because I visit several times a week.

Though, if they do open with that, I bet it's just temporary. They don't want to rock the boat too much initially. It seems odd that so many people will seemingly be able to continue to get away with sharing. Why would they risk doing so much damage to the value of their stocks by announcing something like a year in advance that a crackdown was inevitable, just to gain a small number of extra subscribers in the end? I think they're just playing nice and will begin gradually tightening restrictions, there's no way the 31 day rule is permanent."
Sing On! Spain,🖕😀🖕
Sing On! Spain,I wonder what their next step is once people start mass cancelling their subs? If they offered HD/UHD as standard instead of forcing you to pay extra it wouldn't be too bad but as it is they can shove their sub where the sun doesn't shine.
Sing On! Spain,Need that LPT/hack on how to beat their rules.
Sing On! Spain,Will Netflix be around in the next 5 years?
Sing On! Spain,"Password Sharers: ""We are being exterminated."""
Sing On! Spain,What's happen if you travel aboard and try to watch it on your mobile device or tablet? I am confused with their ip based thing.
Sing On! Spain,"We will cancel people, but not companies. What a time to be alive."
Sing On! Spain,Day 1: can still use my mothers netflix
Sing On! Spain,"And Australia, but they forgot we're the piracy champions of the world"
Sing On! Spain,"Netflix and Prime Video are the only two streaming apps that have picture-in-picture compatibility on Android.

That's is the single reason why I prefer Netflix over the other services. As soon as HBO, Peacock, etc. have this feature I will never use Netflix again, with ot without this rollout"
Sing On! Spain,Adiós Netflix
Sing On! Spain,"I use OnStream, it's free and got movies/series from every platforms. Mindblowing."
Sing On! Spain,They said previously via ip and location based on where main account is located.
Sing On! Spain,">if they want to get 2 additional accounts.

You can only add *one* additional account to a standard sub, two to a premium."
Sing On! Spain,"It’s not so much about adding additional profile, it’s a discounted option to share your account that comes with a bonus profile. So basically instead of someone outside your home paying the full $16.49 for standard for their own plan, you pay $7.99 on their behalf so they can piggy back off your account. It’s their middle ground from outright blocking and expecting they get their own account at full price. So those cases where have that mother that lives alone or your son/daughter who goes off to college  instead of forcing them to pay for their own sub there’s an option to still share."
Sing On! Spain,"There is likely a good reason why it is rolling out in these specific 4 markets before it moves to the bigger regions. No doubt they will monitor how customers respond and adjust the strategy, if needed, before it rolls to bigger regions in Europe and the US. Canada is the test for the US market for sure."
Sing On! Spain,"I just downgraded to the 2 screen plan, because clearly the extra 2 screens are worthless to me if they have to be viewed in the same household. If we're in the same house, why the fuck wouldn't we all watch the same tv? The very first time I encounter any difficulty associated with this bullshit, I'm cancelling."
Sing On! Spain,"the biggest ""sin"" when you run a subscription service is to remind your customer they are subscribed to you constantly."
Sing On! Spain,My wife and I cancelled just last week as well
Sing On! Spain,"Yeah I may just unsubscribe with the plan to subscribe every once in a while. Or I may lose patience waiting for several shows worth subscribing and go back to watching shows in the high waters.

Well done Netflix."
Sing On! Spain,"They need 4 people paying the additional fee for my one cancellation.

I bet they lose a lot this quarter in subs"
Sing On! Spain,"MBA's never factor in that their changes actually drive away customers, they will label anyone who chooses to stop paying for Netflix as automatic pirates who are COSTING the company money they DESERVE, lol - their default stance is anyone not paying for Netflix must be a pirate."
Sing On! Spain,"The device you watch from need to have been connected at least once to your wifi in a 31 day period.

Or you request a temp code, similar to steam guard i would think, if you have steam.. it gives you 7 day access outside of your wifi spot.

At least thats how i have understood it."
Sing On! Spain,Nowy tends.
Sing On! Spain,I think you overestimate how many people complaining about this are paying subscribers
Sing On! Spain,They’ll be fine.
Sing On! Spain,"Watching on a mobile shouldn't be a problem, you just have to have connected to your home wifi in the last 31 days apparently.

But yeah there may be errors though I'm guessing they'll be lenient and just go for it when they're sure of it (for example used on another TV elsewhere than the primary location too regularly to be vacations, that'll get flagged). They have a lot of data after all."
Sing On! Spain,"There was a leak about how Netflix will require you to log into your home network once a month to verify you are still part of the household. 

So the assumption would be that you can use it on any number of devices but have to log in monthly on all of them to your home network to verify."
Sing On! Spain,"You won’t be charged anything unless you elect to be charged.

The transit and work issue you mention would only be an issue if you used your work laptop."
Sing On! Spain,Might need to input a verification code?
Sing On! Spain,For real tho. It is already one of the most expensive streaming services.
Sing On! Spain,"How tf did they put Portugal in the same bag as Canada, Spain and NZ do they know how much we really receive here and how many corruption there is in here? What a bunch of retards"
Sing On! Spain,"They need to rework how they sell their service. I don't want four screens, I want one, in 4K. I don't want their fucking games either. I just want a streaming service. 

So given that, I think they need to entirely restructure how they brand the service. And give people options to build something that meets their needs. 

They won't though, because this is a shameless attempt to cream off more money from people already paying for an overpriced service."
Sing On! Spain,"Not on Reddit for sure. For the larger scale, we have to wait and see. Nothing said here is representative or indicative of anything. I'm sure they've been doing extensive market studies and testing. Hell this is still testing, that's why it's not a global launch."
Sing On! Spain,"Without the 31 day rule, people can get locked out when they're watching on their way to / in the office/school/anywhere not home. That will make a lot more angry customers. 

It's already hard for it to be implemented too: how many people use Netflix on their phone at home when they could have watched on tv or laptop at home? But now they need to do that every 31 days orelse they can't watch Netflix from their phone while outside."
Sing On! Spain,"The current FAQ doesn't explain anything of how they are tracking, but the ""leaked"" one had how the devices had to be ""trusted"" to be use, and so they are demanding you login to the primary household wifi with each device you use. (i.e. Your phone, tablet, computer, television etc)"
Sing On! Spain,🏴‍☠️
Sing On! Spain,VPN?
Sing On! Spain,"They may be, but this policy won't. They had 231M subscribers by the end of 2022 and are saying that 100M households share accounts. They are really playing with fire here and potentially upset almost half of their subscriber base. On the other hand, this rollout to a small (NZ), a medium (Iberia) and a large market (Canada) is clearly Netflix testing the waters for how large of an impact this policy can have. I can't speak for others, but I'm in Portugal (Iberia) and I have a shared account that will be canceled 100%. Even if they reverse this, I don't think my father-in-law, which is paying, will go back to Netflix after some time living without it."
Sing On! Spain,The market leader by far that continues to grow and only streaming service that actually make money? I would say yes.
Sing On! Spain,Probably be bought by Google or Amazon for their back catalog of customer subscriptions.
Sing On! Spain,"So, fuck 5g Home internet users."
Sing On! Spain,So.. dynamic IP addresses can get fucked?
Sing On! Spain,"What makes a profile ""the main one"" though. Whichever one watches it the most?"
Sing On! Spain,Most people probably don’t even know what an IP address is let alone how to find it
Sing On! Spain,Yet that extra 50% doesn't come with additional streaming.
Sing On! Spain,"Nah, my daughter is part of the family, she's at Uni 7 months of the year.  To me that means part of the family account.  The ""discount"" means I pay an extra 6€ a moth for the same service that I get now.  That's a price hike.

I used to pay premium even though there are only 3 of us.  I stupidly thought the High Definition was worthwhile.  After downgrading to 2 account the Lower Resolution is fine.  My wife and I hardly use Netflix, so the only one that will lose out is my University daughter.

She'll have Disney+, Amazon and we may pick up HBO.  Will probably cancel Amazon in a few months too, not watched much on their service."
Sing On! Spain,"I'm in Spain, our daughters is at college and she's the main user of Netflix.  We had the 4 account one, and I downgraded to 2 accounts because I hardly watch anything (it seems to have Korean crap or Teenage coming of age series, I'm not in their target demographic).

Don't worry, if Spain is a test region we'll give their analytics team so e scary cancellation statistics.  I'll be canceling as soon as the rollout hits Spain, and I'll make clear it's the stupid account changes that made me leave."
Sing On! Spain,They've been testing for like a year already but it was more a A/B thing in smaller markets (Europe had the Netherlands for example). This is the big scale test
Sing On! Spain,"Yeah, we share an account across three households (which Netflix has previously encouraged!) and that simply isn’t worth $30/month"
Sing On! Spain,Can i still get 4K? What about when i travel with my phone and my wife is at home?
Sing On! Spain,But you lose a 4k quality with lesser screen plans.
Sing On! Spain,Sounds like fun /s
Sing On! Spain,"What a mess.

I guess that shareholders wanted more revenue, Netflix just knows how to make teenage dramas, so they came up with this great idea."
Sing On! Spain,"No, that FAQ page was deleted. They're not going with that approach for this."
Sing On! Spain,"Maybe, they can be fine without me though lol."
Sing On! Spain,"Well… no, they might not be lol. I’m sure when Netflix came into the picture with a more convenient service Blockbuster thought they’d be fine too lol"
Sing On! Spain,But we don't have home wifi. Cellular internet only. I however download shows over wifi at work. So what now?
Sing On! Spain,Sounds good
Sing On! Spain,I use my personal tablet and download the relevant episodes to it. Or my phone.
Sing On! Spain,"It's highly likely that Portugal and Spain are the same market for Netflix, as it is for so many brands."
Sing On! Spain,"they have a special price for the extra person 4€ month in PT, Spain is 6€"
Sing On! Spain,"Yeah, I have a Fire TV Stick that lives in my suitcase.  It's an extra that I don't use at home, but take with me to plug into hotel TVs when I'm on the road.  The nice thing about it is that I don't have to think about it.  If I have a sudden work trip (they can really happen with less than an hour of warning), I know that it's already going to be ready in my suitcase.

If I have to take it out and prepare it before each trip, that's going to  be a major pain."
Sing On! Spain,"Tbf, Blockbuster was a market leader at one point. And with things like Prime, Disney plus and the 20 other services out there NOT screwing over their customers. It's kinda hard to see a future for Netflix"
Sing On! Spain,Satya Nadella has shown interest.
Sing On! Spain,"Doesn't every T-Mobile user get Netflix On Us? 

Is Netflix about to tell \~110 million TMO US users that they are required to have a second ISP to access the 1 Netflix stream they (TMO) pay for? Oof."
Sing On! Spain,"Yeah - I'm not 5G but I'm a rural Canadian on an LTE service. I have my own radio at my house but myself and neighbors all share one tower and that presumably shares with other towers. If my neighbor and I both ask Google what our IP address is, we get the same address.

Add weird routing to this and it gets even more fun. The other day, the Canadian Tire website tried to set my home store as somewhere in Ontario based on location data. I'm in Alberta. 

We don't share our account with anyone so this *wouldn't* have changed things for us but I suspect we're going to end up cancelling if this gives us all sorts of technical difficulties."
Love on the Spectrum,I really loved Love on the Spectrum!
Love on the Spectrum,I would do unspeakable things for Abbey and David to succeed. They are the cutest couple on TV
Love on the Spectrum,It’s a great show. There’s a similar show in the UK called The Undateables
Love on the Spectrum,Was the rehearsal not eligible?
Love on the Spectrum,this show is so well done and honestly made me more sensitive to folks on the spectrum. love to see it get recognition!
Love on the Spectrum,"As a person with ASD, I found this show wildly offensive and exploitative. The tone of the whole show is basically “Look how funny it is when they struggle! We better zoom in closer on that.” 

Television really seems to struggle to realize that ASD representation does not mean giving us weird superpowers a la The Good Doctor, nor does it mean infantilizing us like Love On the Spectrum. Struggle and unique capability can coexist, and it can be represented in ways that seek both understanding and pride."
Love on the Spectrum,"TIL 'Love On The Spectrum' is not a scripted show.

Also, appreciating the irony of it winning ""unstructured"" reality."
Love on the Spectrum,The show is infanticing autistic people
Love on the Spectrum,"Me too.  I love RuPaul, but I think this is the correct choice."
Love on the Spectrum,"Haven't watched it yet, I was worried it would be cringey."
Love on the Spectrum,They plan on getting married!
Love on the Spectrum,It's it just as feel good?
Love on the Spectrum,Not for this year. Nominees were announced before it even started airing.
Love on the Spectrum,"This is going to cause me to fall down a rabbit hole over the definition of ""unstructured."""
Love on the Spectrum,my god i hope that wins something
Love on the Spectrum,"Yep, as another autistic person, I could not agree more."
Love on the Spectrum,Untucked has been awful for years. I always thought it was kind of a cheat for this award to go to what it is essentially web-related extended content versus an actual TV show.
Love on the Spectrum,It can get awkward but not really cringey. All of the people are really genuine. It's just a pleasant watch.
Love on the Spectrum,Sometimes I’m like “ohhh god *covers eyes*” but then others im crying happy tears along with everyone in the show
Love on the Spectrum,Yes! Also check out Undateables at Christmas
Love on the Spectrum,"Gonna add it to my list, sounds promising."
Love on the Spectrum,Love is Blind Japan was the best and so different from the US version.  It's cool to see how different cultures approach the 'experiment.'
Love on the Spectrum,"Love is Blind is my wife and I's favourite guilty pleasure trash TV. It's an absolute trainwreck of cringe and we binged each season as it came out in a couple of days. 

Also obligatory - fuck Shake."
Love on the Spectrum,Love on the Spectrum is a sweet little show. Not sad to see more of it.
Love on the Spectrum,"I've been meaning to watch the latest season. I don't usually watch stuff like that, but someone I graduated high school with, Deepti, is in the latest season. So it just automatically makes me curious. And I did enjoy the couple seasons of terrace house i wound up watching."
Love on the Spectrum,Glad I cancelled
Love on the Spectrum,They renew the Brazilian version too...
Love on the Spectrum,I wish they would bring back Dating Around. S1 was popular but it seems to have gotten lost in the sea of/upstaged by other dating reality tv.
Love on the Spectrum,How was it different from the US version? My gf watched the US version and I didn't like the way the show was set up and the overall feel of the show
Love on the Spectrum,You're glad you canceled because.... more shows got renewed/picked up?
Love on the Spectrum,"The setup is the same but culturally it’s completely different.  It’s super interesting to see the difference in respect and comradeship vs the Americans which just come off as cheap, drama seeking narcissists."
Love on the Spectrum,Not exactly prestige tv I was looking for when I originally subscribed
Love on the Spectrum,"It’s trashy “reality” TV. 

Two or three months a year is more than enough time to watch the two to three quality shows. 

It also doesn’t help that they’re only releasing them every other year."
Love on the Spectrum,"Also, US dating shows tend to be quite sexual. There was hardly any sexual content on the Japanese version. Agree that it felt more respectful"
Love on the Spectrum,"I mean they have a whooooooooole lot of other shows, but hey if you didn't enjoy Netflix when you had it who am I to judge."
Love on the Spectrum,"> Two or three months a year is more than enough time to watch the two to three quality shows.

I disagree, but whatever, it's your experience I guess. 

> It also doesn’t help that they’re only releasing them every other year.

What!? You think Netflix only release quality shows ever other year?"
Love on the Spectrum,It seems to be the case with all their “big budget” quality shows. They didn’t do it before and they didn’t start doing this because of covid.…yet they keep increasing the Price.
Love on the Spectrum,"They are releasing quality shows every week in some cases- we just had Last Kingdom, Top Boy, Vikings, Juvenile Justice, Drive to Survive etc and coming up soon we’ll have Bridgerton, Russian Doll, Grace and Frankie and Ozark. 

The distain for Netflix in this sub for easy upvotes is absolutely comical."
Love on the Spectrum,this was on the ABC a while ago right? parts of it definitely seem familiar. any Australians here know what I'm talking about?
Love on the Spectrum,"Please join the discussion at 
r/LoveOnTheSpectrumShow"
Love on the Spectrum,"Yes you’re 100% correct, this is the same series that aired on ABC.

Last I heard they were casting for Season 2. 

Anyone not familiar with the show, it’s fantastic and I’d suggest watching. If you know the UK’s The Undateables, it’s in the same vein."
Love on the Spectrum,thank you! I had no idea it was coming to Netflix. the other series was lovely
Love on the Spectrum,"I loved how they didn't take themselves too seriously in the final season as well.

Singing ""U + Ur hand"" to a group a Nazis and ""I had the time of my life"" for the final showdown."
Love on the Spectrum,"Emily Hampshire is really good in this, she plays Brad Pitt's character from the movies."
Love on the Spectrum,"Deacon is in this season of Picard. 

I am just now finding out that Picard has a lot of 12 Monkeys references because they share some of the same writers or something?"
Love on the Spectrum,"Love this show, causality and fixed time loops scratch that itch in my brain so good."
Love on the Spectrum,For those who haven't watched - it's a really fun and satisfying show. The cast is great and every single mystery set up during the show is answered by the end of the excellent series finale.
Love on the Spectrum,A show with a perfect ending. It's rare you get a show that wraps everything up so nicely.
Love on the Spectrum,Really liked the ending.Fun ride for sure.
Love on the Spectrum,"Some of my favorite shows of all time are Breaking Bad, Better Call Saul, Mr. Robot, The Leftovers, Dark, and Bojack Horseman.

I put 12 Monkeys in the same category. It is that good.

It is overlooked and dismissed for some unfair reasons: (1) It is based on the movie. But the show goes WAY BEYOND the source material and becomes it's own story. The show is levels better than the movie. (2) It was on SyFy which has a somewhat deserved reputation of airing crap. 12 Monkeys should have been on AMC (when AMC meant something)."
Love on the Spectrum,"Show runner and writer Terry Matalas is currently killing it on season 3 of Picard, which is poetic seeing how dude made his bones on DS9 and has now come full circle."
Love on the Spectrum,[deleted]
Love on the Spectrum,"My film professor in college absolutely hated this series and I never understood why. It's a bit campy and doesn't take itself too seriously but for what it is, it's a great show."
Love on the Spectrum,It's not prestigious TV or anything but it's damn good scifi and just fun! Definitely got one of the best endings of a show.
Love on the Spectrum,"One of my all-time favorite shows! We were just talking about it the other day. I'm so glad we got to see it all the way to the end and that it didn't get cancelled halfway through like so many others. 

99 Luftballoons was just a bonus none of us knew we needed."
Love on the Spectrum,Probably my favorite show of all time. Definitely the best time travel show of all time. Watch it.
Love on the Spectrum,"Well based on the comments here, I'll have to give it a go!"
Love on the Spectrum,"I'm struggling a bit with Season 1. I know the show is supposed to get better, but the editing/writing/music feel very 2015 SyFy (which is hardly surprising I guess). 

Does it shake some of this off in the later seasons?"
Love on the Spectrum,This show was great. Might be time for a rewatch
Love on the Spectrum,"I thought it was pretty entertaining and certainly doesn't get the respect it deserves compared to other recent sci-fi programming. The woman basically playing the Brad Pitt character had a great run - she went from being a bit annoying to the show stealer.

Still had some issues though. The baddies were like comic book baddies, it might have been more interesting if they were more nuanced. Sometimes character motivations felt forced to make the time loops still work. And the usual stuff where it falls apart if you think about it too hard (They will reject an obvious solution because it might ""affect the timeline"", then the next episode they do something way more drastic in the past and it's seemingly not a problem.)"
Love on the Spectrum,Travelers is a good time travel show
Love on the Spectrum,One of the few shows I'll watch at least yearly all the way through. Amazing television.
Love on the Spectrum,This show is one of my favourite shows of all time. It’s entertaining and time travel actually makes sense. Very well written and underrated for sure.
Love on the Spectrum,"This show was a ""secret tip"" over 5 years ago... But there are still people who had never heard of it. 

This show is one of my all-time favorite shows."
Love on the Spectrum,This is probably the best time travel show I have ever seen and probably the best sci-fi show show after Fringe for me.
Love on the Spectrum,"I've definitely watched this show. But honestly I cant remember really anything from it. 
A showdown in a warehouse? 

Was it really that good? How comes I don't remember what happens in it. Hmm."
Love on the Spectrum,Love this show so much.
Love on the Spectrum,"It's a shame that many, many people quit this show during the first season altough the story hasn't begun yet. It takes time to unfold. This is one of the best written shows and it has the BEST FINALE ever. Better than Six Feet Under. Better than Breaking Bad. It has no plotholes (which is insane because it's time travel) and you can even watch it backwards and it still makes sense.

Don't even get me started on one of the best characters ever developed: Jennifer. What a delight. THIS is how you write strong women, dear Hollywood!

What a masterpiece!
10/10"
Love on the Spectrum,I stopped somewhere S02. Dont know why
Love on the Spectrum,"Fantastic show, where does it stream?"
Love on the Spectrum,"Absolutely loved this show. Been trying to chase a similar show to scratch the itch for time travel and/or epic scifi ever since, and just can't find one. Closest thing was probably Continuum. But Battlestar and 12 Monkeys are probably my two favorite epic sagas."
Love on the Spectrum,"I stopped watching, because while it had good scifi and concepts, it felt like the same antagonist/situation season after season."
Love on the Spectrum,"great show
always recommend it"
Love on the Spectrum,"I loved Nikita, and since this show had a bunch of that cast and I always enjoyed the movie I checked it out. I remember enjoying the first season but just kinda stopped watching after a while, I need to get back into it one day, always heard good things."
Love on the Spectrum,Same show runner for the new season of Picard which is night and day different quality from the first awful 2 seasons of Picard.
Love on the Spectrum,"I never knew there was a show, will check it out."
Love on the Spectrum,I've seen the movie.  Didn't know there was a show.
Love on the Spectrum,"This show, Black Sails, and The Leftovers have been among the most satisfying series for me in recent years. They are exceptional, and worth investing the time into.

12 Monkeys is a carefully planned and well executed time travel story that will have you on your toes for the duration of your first viewing, and if you rewatch you will get the pay off of seeing how lovingly the puzzle got masterfully shifted into place. 

Genuinely one of my all-time favourite TV shows."
Love on the Spectrum,"The movie was brilliant, if depressing. I never even heard of this show till now."
Love on the Spectrum,I still watch full series every few years. A good example of how a reimagining / reboot can work.
Love on the Spectrum,You really can see the actors and writers having fun.
Love on the Spectrum,"wasn't a huge fan of the movie, hows the show in comparison?

edit: alright i'm convinced. going to potentially binge it this weekend!"
Love on the Spectrum,"Loved this show. So we’ll done. As much as I would have liked more seasons, it ended well and feels complete."
Love on the Spectrum,I loved this show. Definitely worth a watch.
Love on the Spectrum,Aaron Stanford should be a bigger star than he is
Love on the Spectrum,"I haven't seen it in a while but I remember thinking it went on for too long. They had a great reveal of who the villain was but then it felt like thet got renewed for more episodes and had to add a 'actually, this was the real villain all along'."
Love on the Spectrum,"If you get past the fact that the show is a reboot/reimagining of the original movie premise, then it is a really fun watch. They really fleshed out the characters and just took it in a whole new direction. The movie is definitely in my top 10 list. I love Terry Gilliam movies and the heartbreakingly beautiful closed loop time travel paradox ending will always be a cinema high to me."
Love on the Spectrum,"i liked it, i watched it until the thing with the baby and it was too much."
Love on the Spectrum,"My favorite TV show of all time. Great story, time travel is very thrilling and keeps you invested, but even the best of stories is nothing without great characters and this series has amazing characters. By the end of it I was very invested emotionally in the characters. Also, the best finale I've ever watched, which is very hard to get right."
Love on the Spectrum,In this thumbnail that guy could’ve already shot her. Shows use guns so stupidly and it doesn’t add to the excitement at all. Basically TV writers have no respect for or connection to other people and are all Michael Scott.
Love on the Spectrum,Couldn’t the guy in the picture quickly scoot slightly to his left and take the shot with her head turned?
Love on the Spectrum,"I wish the true ending was the bleaker one, but still enjoyed the show."
Love on the Spectrum,Someone must have never seen futurama
Love on the Spectrum,"Man that show was an insult to the source material. 

Y'all like that show but hated Cowboy Bebop is sure a indictment to objectivity."
Love on the Spectrum,[deleted]
Love on the Spectrum,"Been thinking alot about this show lately, especially when ""red flowers"" became a device on ""LA Brea""."
Love on the Spectrum,Where can 12 monkeys be streamed in the US?
Love on the Spectrum,"I think I forgot about it. The movie was a real trip - if the show is that good, I need to watch it."
Love on the Spectrum,"Where can we watch this? Indian here. HBO content is on Hotstar for your reference. 

Lionsgate, Hulu are shared between Prime and Hotstar."
Love on the Spectrum,Started drinking whiskey sours because of this show.
Fear City: New York vs The Mafia,"Looks really good. I'm glad Giuliani is feature. I am by no means a fan of his, but you can't tell a story of 1980s- early 2000s New York without mentioning him. The man had a great hand in dealing with the mafia during his time at SDNY. Quite the resume before falling off the rocker after 9/11."
Fear City: New York vs The Mafia,I’ve been really into mafia history the last couple months. This is coming at a great time me. I can’t wait.
Fear City: New York vs The Mafia,I’ll tune in to see the theme but will reserve the right to bail if it sucks
Fear City: New York vs The Mafia,"I stopped after Roanoke, which I thought was a good season, but I still always tune in for the show's promo materials up until the new season's opening sequence just because they're interesting."
Fear City: New York vs The Mafia,"The fan sites that decided to base their lucrative time and efforts on promoting the show without any official support and who [decided to go on strike](https://www.primetimer.com/news/american-horror-story-fan-accounts-strike-ryan-murphy-fx#:~:text=Podcasts-,American%20Horror%20Story%20Fan%20Accounts%20Go%20on%20Strike%20to%20Protest,the%20show%20on%20their%20own.&text=American%20Horror%20Story%20fans%20are,they're%20going%20on%20strike.) because the network didn't give them any tidbits of information must be happy that their drought of entitlement is over."
Fear City: New York vs The Mafia,Finally a season that doesn't fall apart halfway through! jk
Fear City: New York vs The Mafia,It's weird that they are just announcing it a few weeks before airing. I miss the viral marketing the show use to have.
Fear City: New York vs The Mafia,"Maybe unpopular opinion because he seems to be well liked, but I don’t find Kal Penn a good actor at all. Like he really feels like a regular guy reading a script. He even managed to make How I Met Your Mother even less funny, which is quite a feat. Is there anything he’s really good in i’ve missed?"
Fear City: New York vs The Mafia,I was hoping Macaulay Culkin would be in this season. He was so great in S10.
Fear City: New York vs The Mafia,"I've never watched AHS, is there a general consensus on the best seasons? I'd like to watch a few."
Fear City: New York vs The Mafia,SEASON 11! Where have I been?
Fear City: New York vs The Mafia,American Horror Story: Flog the dead horse.
Fear City: New York vs The Mafia,"I dont know what Zachary Quinto is doing for his acting career but he should be a much bigger star. I know he has a production company, but after Star Trek and Margin Call I thought he would be a bigger name. And now he's signing on to a Ryan Murphy TV show? I just feel like his talents are being wasted."
Fear City: New York vs The Mafia,"No mention of Kal Penn in the article so Idk why he's in the title. Other than Billie Lourd this is probably the least interesting cast so far, and by a wide margin."
Fear City: New York vs The Mafia,What can be scary in NYC?
Fear City: New York vs The Mafia,Never heard of More Starring
Fear City: New York vs The Mafia,[deleted]
Fear City: New York vs The Mafia,more starring is a great up and comer! looking forward to their role in the show!
Fear City: New York vs The Mafia,Wish they would time the start of the season so that the finale falls near or before Halloween. I hate when my horror content carries over into November.
Fear City: New York vs The Mafia,Is it going to be set in modern day or some retro time like 2001?
Fear City: New York vs The Mafia,Season 11 is such a disappointment
Fear City: New York vs The Mafia,Just like Ryan Murphy does
Fear City: New York vs The Mafia,Spoiler alert: it will.
Fear City: New York vs The Mafia,"It's getting to be just more of the same.

I'll give it a go but the past few seasons have gone downhill fast"
Fear City: New York vs The Mafia,“…if”
Fear City: New York vs The Mafia,"Speaking about themes, the theme tune for 1984 slaps."
Fear City: New York vs The Mafia,"I also really enjoyed Roanoke.  Honestly, I recommend the first five episodes of last season (Double Feature, specifically the Red Tide story).  But don't watch episode 6.  If there's anything you ever do, do not watch episode 6."
Fear City: New York vs The Mafia,"Roanoke really felt like they reached peak horror. A lot of seasons just felt like they weren’t actually trying to be scary, but Roanoke was a great horror season."
Fear City: New York vs The Mafia,"1984 was great, campy fun. And Red Tide was near-perfect until the last episode."
Fear City: New York vs The Mafia,"The promo materials and opening sequence are often times the best part of the show imo.

And I consider myself a fan of AHS."
Fear City: New York vs The Mafia,"I can remember the exact moment I stopped- *Apocalypse*, boys school flashback episode, twelve minutes in. It was a real ‘nope, I’m done’ moment."
Fear City: New York vs The Mafia,Yeah. Why does this have 11 seasons when it stopped being decent after 2 seasons?
Fear City: New York vs The Mafia,[deleted]
Fear City: New York vs The Mafia,"Tried explaining to fans the other day that perhaps — JUST PERHAPS — Murphy has a promotional agreement in his contract to support Dahmer up and through its release (Netflix probably wouldn’t want him spending their time in the spotlight promoting a competing network’s show), and that once the week of release is up, he’d move to promoting AHS.

They didn’t like that. AHS fans think they’re supposed to get a notification the minute Murphy sits down and puts one word to the page for the first episode of a new season. 

They’re almost as entitled as Rick and Morty fans — and god help me, I enjoy both shows."
Fear City: New York vs The Mafia,I'm shocked to hear that people making their living off of clickbait found it's easier to stir up controversy than generate new content lol
Fear City: New York vs The Mafia,He was really bad in HIMYM but I liked him in House.
Fear City: New York vs The Mafia,"1, 2 and 6 are generally universally beloved

>though 1 feels extremely early 2010’s and doesn’t really hold up.

3 is fine but campier, 4 and 5 are kind of great but start to show real faults and are carried by aesthetics. Beyond that it gets pretty rocky"
Fear City: New York vs The Mafia,Murder House and Coven are my favorite seasons.
Fear City: New York vs The Mafia,1 2 3 4 9
Fear City: New York vs The Mafia,"I feel like Murder House (season 1) gets a lot of love and is overall a pretty solid show. After that, I would say Hotel (5) and Roanoke (6) are the best but I haven't watched any after those."
Fear City: New York vs The Mafia,"I would assume fans of the show care about Quinto and O'Hare, though the script still matters more."
Fear City: New York vs The Mafia,Staten Island
Fear City: New York vs The Mafia,The constant smell of piss everywhere and the green puddles along sidewalks.
Fear City: New York vs The Mafia,The cost of living
Fear City: New York vs The Mafia,Being lost in it as a kid?
Fear City: New York vs The Mafia,I’m thinking it’s Broadway related. Phantom of the Opera style maybe.
Fear City: New York vs The Mafia,It's about the Son of Sam and other serial killers targeting the gay community in the 70s/80s
Fear City: New York vs The Mafia,Scaffolding
Fear City: New York vs The Mafia,"I don’t trust Ryan Murphy to properly handle indigenous culture, so no skin walkers please."
Fear City: New York vs The Mafia,Aliens were featured in death valley which was part 2 of season 10
Fear City: New York vs The Mafia,">  aliens

There have been aliens in AHS, though?"
Fear City: New York vs The Mafia,Rumored to be the late 70s early 80s
Fear City: New York vs The Mafia,"Actually I think I love the idea of the show more if most seasons have sucked due to people realizing within two to four episodes that nobody knows where this is going. I really did adore a few of the early seasons, though, the first season was wonderful enough that it has tricked me into continuing to try."
Fear City: New York vs The Mafia,But it will start great!
Fear City: New York vs The Mafia,What a fucking nosedive episode 6 took. They were so close to telling the best AHS story yet they just fumbled the landing
Fear City: New York vs The Mafia,"man I totally agree. They were SO CLOSE to getting it right all the way through for once! The second half of the season was all bad, tho"
Fear City: New York vs The Mafia,"Funnily enough, the first 5 episodes of the previous season ""1984"" also were good, but then episode 6 onwards was terrible."
Fear City: New York vs The Mafia,Oh I love 1984. As an 80's kid it really brought back memories.
Fear City: New York vs The Mafia,1984 was so campy it was great.
Fear City: New York vs The Mafia,1984 by george orwell 1949
Fear City: New York vs The Mafia,Not just 11; it's renewed through season 13 and also has 2 seasons of a spinoff anthology series.
Fear City: New York vs The Mafia,What stan culture does to people
Fear City: New York vs The Mafia,"> dumb shit in fandom

I’m still gonna put the Arrow fans who harassed the lead actor’s wife because he wasn’t dating his on-screen love interest in real life over that. Garbage behavior for a garbage ship."
Fear City: New York vs The Mafia,"That seems strange to hear because I started with Asylum and loved it, went back to Murder House and thought it sucked, then saw Coven and immediately jumped off after it ended because it was just so bad."
Fear City: New York vs The Mafia,That's how I'm feeling. O'Hare is always one of my favorites and Quinto coming back is sweet.
Fear City: New York vs The Mafia,I like O'Hare but he's been in the show so much and is never my favourite part so 🤷‍♂️
Fear City: New York vs The Mafia,First 3 seasons was some gourmet shit. After that it was definitely a show
Fear City: New York vs The Mafia,That is also true
Fear City: New York vs The Mafia,That’s basically every season since season 1
Fear City: New York vs The Mafia,I remember watching it an enjoying it. Why should I hate it again? My brain has erased it from memory.
Fear City: New York vs The Mafia,"I felt the opposite, that 1984 invited you to take it less seriously so the usual weaknesses didn't matter nearly as much."
Fear City: New York vs The Mafia,Coven was the funniest shit ever.
Fear City: New York vs The Mafia,"Quinto killed it in Asylum though and hasn't been back since, so I'm pretty pumped about that.  Quinto plays a good serial killer with that Asylum role and season 1 Sylar in Heroes."
Fear City: New York vs The Mafia,Yeah but usually the nosedive is in episode 6/10. This was episode 6/6. Got my hopes up when I shouldn't have lol
Fear City: New York vs The Mafia,Everything after >!the daughter killed her father!< onwards was just so goofy. That part at least tracks story wise but once they get to LA afterwards the events are so nonsensical and tonally different to the rest of the story
Fear City: New York vs The Mafia,"Coven is glorious camp and I loved the sheer absurdity of like 90% of the cast dying and being resurrected via magic. Hotel's a mess but I love it for similar reasons, especially the iconic scene of Evan Peters as a psychotic ghostly murderous hotel owner murdering a woman while he proclaims ""You may be a witch, my dear....but I'm a ghooost."""
Fear City: New York vs The Mafia,I just meant the nosedive part I still eat this shit up every year but I never expect them to know how to write an ending
Fear City: New York vs The Mafia,"Oh yeah, forgot all about that. It definitely felt silly, like an SNL sketch that didn't know how to end."
Fear City: New York vs The Mafia,I wouldve liked to continue with Hotel but the first episode was really not great for me.
Fear City: New York vs The Mafia,Just do the Monty python thing where the cops come in and arrest everyone
Fear City: New York vs The Mafia,"I really enjoy, uh, the pausing nature of his, uh, narration."

Fear City: New York vs The Mafia,"Is this the guy who does those short films like the one about having bedbugs, or the one about dating in NYC?

Edit: yes it is! You can watch his films here: https://vimeo.com/johnsmovies"
Fear City: New York vs The Mafia,"I’ve enjoyed all of the episodes so far. I’m a bit of a sucker for daily life type clips though. John is awkwardly funny but not overly so. Worth a shot to see if it’s up your alley for sure. Nathan For You was an infinitely funnier show, don’t go in expecting that level of humor."
Fear City: New York vs The Mafia,"Oh man, Kyle McLaughlin swiping his card. I was sold."
Fear City: New York vs The Mafia,The one where the referees wouldn't follow the rules absolutely killed me.

Fear City: New York vs The Mafia,[deleted]
Fear City: New York vs The Mafia,Be warned. The episode How to Cover Your Furniture is... Umm. Interesting.
Fear City: New York vs The Mafia,"I thought this entire show was fantastic, like actually amazing. Was able to make me feel all sorts of emotions in a single episode while also having that odd Nathan For You type humor. The way it was able to capture certain distinct personalities in a way that was both absurd and human was really special.

It might not be for everyone but I’d honestly recommend everyone just try it out because there is a lot of greatness here and it definitely deserves a second season."
Fear City: New York vs The Mafia,[deleted]
Fear City: New York vs The Mafia,my new favorite show that (currently) nobody I know is watching
Fear City: New York vs The Mafia,Been waiting for years for Nathan Fielder to come out with something new and it did NOT disappoint
Fear City: New York vs The Mafia,"The finale was so strangely beautiful.

Actually this might be my favorite show in hbo these days"
Fear City: New York vs The Mafia,Working on this show was genuinely awesome. I had a blast working with them. John is a genuinely great dude based on the short interactions I had with him.
Fear City: New York vs The Mafia,"This show is incredible and such a fascinating look into human nature. I think a lot of the “random” run ins are planned especially with the Mandala effect shop owner and the Foreskin rejuvenator. Might not be but I think it’s part of the dry wit of the show.

I’m also biased because any show with NY as a character is especially fascinating to me. All of the seemingly perfectly composed shots of day-to-day life he has lined up with his narration. John Wilson himself is also a fascinating character, especially his seemingly  endless collection of footage and his personal journal. Has made me think a lot about the kind of mindset to record everything and live behind the camera."
Fear City: New York vs The Mafia,The episode on covering your furniture went a lot deeper then I thought it would.
Fear City: New York vs The Mafia,I love how John has the same disarming nature as Nathan but approaches it in a much more reflective way. There is meditative quality to it that I find weirdly therapeutic.
Fear City: New York vs The Mafia,[deleted]
Fear City: New York vs The Mafia,"I keep asking myself ""how is he able to use this footage?!"" Does anyone know how he's able to use people's faces?"
Street Food: Latin America,Love these shows. So simple and easy to watch.
Street Food: Latin America,"The Peru episode better have Fried Guinea Pig on a stick! It’s a common one to see, and a popular one too.

That aside, I like the idea, just hope isn’t too... corny? That one woman shouting at the beach for instance. Doesn’t feel empowering, just makes me think about how everyone else at the beach is gonna be look at her like a wacko."
Street Food: Latin America,"they're going to bolivia, nice to see them show loves to some of the lesser known countries & cuisines"
Street Food: Latin America,can't wait for the pandemic to end and start travel and eat all the amazing food again!
Street Food: Latin America,[deleted]
Street Food: Latin America,"The problem with these shows is just like finding recipes online. 

90% of it is filler that you don’t care about when you just want to see the food and how it’s made. 

The big difference is these shows you can’t scroll past the bs and instead have to watch it all."
Street Food: Latin America,Cool
Street Food: Latin America,They're not food network cooking shows dum dum
Street Food: Latin America,"I also thought this show was hammy and formulaic, but it was still a fun watch. Excited to see what Latin American street food looks like."
Street Food: Latin America,ouch
Street Food: Latin America,"They’ve got a point though. I just finished it. It was a show about people, not about food. Don’t get me wrong, it was good, but I was expecting a Flavorful Origins-style doc. The title should be more representative of its narrative. Like “Food Stories” or “Street Chefs.”"

Street Food: Latin America,When you let AI write your article 💀
Street Food: Latin America,">which this Sunday premiered its first episode, maintaining the weekly launch dynamic from the previous era stream.

Wut?"
Street Food: Latin America,What an unbelievably shit article 😂
Street Food: Latin America,How much is HBO paying Reddit to post this garbage over and over?
Street Food: Latin America,"That's hardly ""making history"" to be the most watched show on a service that's only been around for a very short time, and only in one market.

Making history would be the most watched premiere on say, all streaming services ever, globally."
Street Food: Latin America,"I copy pasted the article into ChatGPT and told it to make it coherent and [it did an infinitely better job](https://i.imgur.com/wuhHPUe.jpg):

>HBO continues to uphold its reputation for producing high-quality, award-winning series with its latest major production, ""The Last of Us."" Based on the popular video game of the same name, the apocalyptic drama premiered its first episode on Sunday, maintaining the weekly launch dynamic that has worked well for the channel and studio in the past.
>
>The series, which was created by Craig Mazin, the creator of ""Chernobyl,"" and Neil Druckmann, the creator of the acclaimed video game, has already made a significant impact. The premiere episode, titled ""When You're Lost in the Dark,"" became the most viewed premiere in HBO Max history in Latin America within its first 24 hours of availability. This achievement beat out two other strong performers: the first day of the debut episode of ""Game of Thrones"" and the second season premiere of ""Euphoria.""
>
>""The Last of Us"" takes place twenty years after modern civilization is destroyed by the spread of a virus. The story follows Joel (Peter Pascal), a seasoned survivor, who is hired to smuggle 14-year-old Ellie (Bella Ramsey) out of an oppressive quarantine zone. However, what starts out as a small job quickly becomes a brutal and harrowing journey as the two must rely on each other to survive as they travel across the United States. The series is not just appealing to fans of the video game, but also to a wider audience.
>
>The series has also been a hit on social media, trending as #1 worldwide on Twitter on the night of its premiere. Brazil was the market with the most conversations about the series on social networks worldwide, accounting for over 50% of those mentions and dominating fifteen of the thirty top hashtags in the country during Sunday night.
>
>With a production budget of about one hundred million dollars, ""The Last of Us"" is expected to continue to dominate conversations every week with each new episode. In addition, the series also boasts an Argentinean presence with Gustavo Santaolalla, the Oscar winner for ""Babel"" and ""The Secret in the Mountains,"" as the creator of the music for the series. Santaolalla had already created the songs for the video game and knew well the world his music was to have.
>
>In addition to Pascal and Bella Ramsey, the cast of ""The Last of Us"" also includes Gabriel Luna, Anna Torv, Nico Parker, Murray Bartlett, Nick Offerman, Melanie Lynskey, Storm Reid, and Merle Dandridge, among others. The series premiered its second episode on Sunday, January 22nd at 11pm on HBO Max and HBO.

I implore content farms to start using AI instead whatever the fuck are they using now."
Street Food: Latin America,"I think AI would have been better hahahah 

Sadly didn't find any other translated content (I'm Brazilian)"
Street Food: Latin America,I think it's trying to say HBO has historically released their biggest shows like Game Of Thrones on Sundays and the Last of Us is keeping up the tradition. Definitely weird wording.
Street Food: Latin America,Ai
Street Food: Latin America,"Seems like it was translated, some rogue ""y""s instead of ""and""s"
Street Food: Latin America,I wish they were paying me.
Street Food: Latin America,It's probably just a poorly translated article that didn't get formatted properly
Street Food: Latin America,Too true

Street Food: Latin America,"Not sure. Friends is very popular in Brazil at least. Now about Office, yes. The Office is not very popular, most people who watched only watched in latest years..."
Street Food: Latin America,It'll keep doing that for even 30 years.
Street Food: Latin America,It always has. Here in the U.S it’s still the 2nd most streamed show on HBO but the idiotic Reddit hive-mind would make you believe “nobody cares anymore”
Street Food: Latin America,[deleted]
Street Food: Latin America,"Yep, Brazilian. Game of Thrones is definitely the biggest TV show to date. I'm not a GoT fan, only watched the first season, and it was basically impossible to use social networks around GoT time because everyone talked about it.  

I'm yet to see a TV show that was like this here.  

Now, Star Wars is less popular than Marvel, DC, GoT...."
Street Food: Latin America,Mucha Lucha 2 ?
Street Food: Latin America,# [WHO'S THAT JUMPING OUT THE SKY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnBqJr3QBdk)
Street Food: Latin America,"Did anyone ever watch Mucha Lucha as a kid? That show’s theme somg was awesome: https://youtu.be/31NxuMrtWsk

My Guatemalan baby sitter would always be so excited to see my brother and I watching a Latin American-influenced cartoon"
Street Food: Latin America,This sucks. He just lost his eye and he won’t be able to fully appreciate the show.
Street Food: Latin America,I'll have to keep an eye out for it.
Street Food: Latin America,"Awesome! I wonder if a.) WWE’s gonna collaborate on this in any fashion, or b.) if we’ll get an English dub too. Might just watch the original version and use it to pick back up on my Spanish.

In any case, this is cool because it seems like CN’s wanted to do a lucha show for a while, they had an El Santo show lined up for a U.S. release (after a microseries did well in the LatAm market), so this is really cool to see."
Street Food: Latin America,The description of that show is amazing lol. If I was 7-12ish id be hooked.
Street Food: Latin America,I always played as him in the WWE games!
Street Food: Latin America,Last I heard about rey mysterio he had that terrible accident in the ring with the other guy. How's he been doing from that?
Street Food: Latin America,"Considering Rey is popular in the rest of North America I'm hoping they do an English track also. Not sure of much in terms what's playing on CN nowadays, but this would seem like a minor hit with Pro-Wrestling's re-growth, not to mention a lot of fun as well."
Street Food: Latin America,Rey Mysterio's Rock 'n' Wrestling?
Street Food: Latin America,"Good, when I was younger Rey was my idol I'm glad he's still being a good role model for kids"
Street Food: Latin America,This sounds right up my alley
Street Food: Latin America,booyaka booyaka!
Street Food: Latin America,He's been around a while. I worked for TBS as the video projectionist for WCW Thunder and Nitro in the late 90's and 2000. The acrobatics these guys performed impressed everyone. Push back from lumbering wrestlers overcame their early popularity. American fans prefer mutant giants that flex the deck when they hit it. We tried working them into vignettes but the language problem and their small size made things complicated.
Street Food: Latin America,"They should go the [Adult Swim] route and have him solve mysteries like the Mike Tyson one.

“Rey’s Mysterios”"
Street Food: Latin America,Does the villain coincidentally end up laying face-down across some ropes every episode?
Street Food: Latin America,La Parka or GTFO
Street Food: Latin America,Maybe he can go around solving crimes and unmasking other luchadores in a van called the Mysterio Machine
Street Food: Latin America,[Here's hoping we get a storyline where he beats his kids.................in WWE 13.](https://twitter.com/reymysterio/status/263061905764151296?s=20)
Street Food: Latin America,That's fucking awesome.
Street Food: Latin America,So like the Santo movies?
Street Food: Latin America,Good for him! Haven’t watched WWE in a while but Rey is a legend. Pretty sure he went to the Lucha network a few years back.
Street Food: Latin America,love rey mysterio so cool
Street Food: Latin America,Thats cool
Street Food: Latin America,He’s the man
Street Food: Latin America,He killed a guy once from his 619
Street Food: Latin America,Luchq Dora the Explora
Street Food: Latin America,Keep searching boys we gotta find who the fuck asked
Street Food: Latin America,"It should be like Rock N Wrestling, where Rey has a team of technicos, and he battles a team of rudos, led by like Andrade."
Street Food: Latin America,"How did this guy get his own show, but not Bat Manuel. This is clearly racism against bats, due to that whole COVID thing."
Street Food: Latin America,"This seems about 15 years too late, but nonetheless congrats to Rey."
Street Food: Latin America,Mascara Magica tribute when?
Street Food: Latin America,"The industry is ugly. 

It's carny bullshit, and we routinely watch women and men take decades off their lives one match at a time. The McMahons routinely cross the line between everyday villainy and cartoonish supervillainy.  No matter what strides are made in human/worker's rights in society, the Wrestling industry is routinely/habitually years, or decades, behind the curve.

But. 

Pro Wrestling and the Olympics are humanity's best ongoing showcases of what our bodies and brains can accomplish with training. They let us see people do the impossible. Sometimes those people look like us. Increasingly, more of them look and act and love like more of us. Rey has been a literal superhero for decades. I'm so glad he gets to canonize that in the proper medium. 

I don't know if I want more kids to dream of putting on tights and backflipping onto their necks for our entertainment; I don't know if the current industry makes that trade-off worth it. But I'm happy kids will see Rey, a guy who looks and talks like them, as a capital-H hero. He'll do the impossible. And I hope they'll find an impossible and do it too."
Street Food: Latin America,"makes me think of Mucha Lucha obviously but also Guacamelee, hope it turns out well"
Street Food: Latin America,"OMG... This is great news... I grew out of my WWE maybe in my 16-17...I'm in my late thirties now... And Ray Mysterio was the last wrestler in that industry I remember. 

Short, but man those moves stuck in my head for so long."
Street Food: Latin America,"Yo jo, yo jo a pirate's life for me!"
Street Food: Latin America,Rey has always been my favorites wrestler. The Mugsy Bouges of wrestling.
Street Food: Latin America,Who's that jumping off the sky R E Y Mysterio here we GO
Street Food: Latin America,Would have worked really well in the 90s with Biker Mice From Mars and Mmmies Alive.
Street Food: Latin America,That’s nice
Street Food: Latin America,619
Street Food: Latin America,61999999999
Street Food: Latin America,"Not surprised, in the ring he was always so animated!!!!"
Street Food: Latin America,Mr T pities the fool who rips off his 80s cartoon.
Street Food: Latin America,That’s mad
Street Food: Latin America,The greatest of all time gets his own cartoon!
Street Food: Latin America,He’s still at it?! Damn
Street Food: Latin America,Imo Mysterio was always the coolest WWE wrestler.
Street Food: Latin America,"I loved rey mysterio growing up, this is kinda disappointing knowing i won't be able to watch this"
Street Food: Latin America,BOOYAKAH
Street Food: Latin America,Me yelling “Booyaka booyaka 619!” As I jump off my bunk bed in a flying elbow position headed right for my sisters dome piece
Street Food: Latin America,dude wtf is that website. toxic ads
Street Food: Latin America,Holy shit!! Used to watch WWE as a kid but stopped watching it Rey Mysterio is in my top 10 favorite wrestlers i was so bummed when he retired but had no clue he RETURNED?! Good for him on both those things!! That makes me extremely happy for him
Street Food: Latin America,nice
Street Food: Latin America,Wow Is he still practicing ?? How old is he now anyone know ?
Street Food: Latin America,The animation is...eye popping
Street Food: Latin America,Living the El Santo life
Street Food: Latin America,"One of the most recognizable pro wrestlers has finally got his own Animated show, which sounds pretty awesome really."
Street Food: Latin America,I'll keep an eye out for it.
Street Food: Latin America,"This guy came to my new startup school when I was in 4th grade and I still don’t really know who he is, but yeah! Good for him!"
Street Food: Latin America,The Flea can take down Mysterio any day.
Street Food: Latin America,Still the best character on wcw vs nwo
Street Food: Latin America,What is it about
Street Food: Latin America,Nice
The Luminaries,Very meh
The Luminaries,"Lol i hated it but do what you must. 

> How much mystery is there?

Not much. The show foolishly gives away its supernatural aspects from the first episode. 

> Is the acting and writing good?

Acting is good.... I mean it's Eva Green and Eve Hewson. Writing is mediocre. 

> Did you enjoy watching it?

No I quit after 4 epsiodes."
The Luminaries,"I watched 1 episode, and I can totally see there is something there, but I didn't watch episode 2. So...take that for what you will."
The Luminaries,"I enjoyed the show! Is it the best thing ever? No not at all. But I think it is worth the watch. Visually I thought it looked great and was shot well. There is mystery for sure, it centers around a murder. The acting is great, but the writing is just ok. I thought at times the writing could be a little confusing and clunky. The pace could also be a little weird especially in the middle of the series."
The Luminaries,"So, yeah. I found the first episode quite enjoyable to watch and am looking forward to next week.

 The events presented were things that happened in the book, although the order of presentation was quite different.   

We got two timelines interwoven : the earlier timeline (April 1865) of Anna and Emery arriving in Dunedin and Anna meeting Lydia Wells; and the later timeline (January 1866) opening up with a mysterious shooting; and then Anna being arrested in Hokitika in connection with the murder of Crosbie Wells. 

In the book, it started off with the later timeline and we did not go back to 1865 until about halfway through to flesh out the back-story of the characters.

A major omission so far is that we have not met Walter Moody who served as a POV character for the opening parts of the book; and a lot of the events of the story were told by means of a luminary recounting the events to Moody. I wonder if maybe the TV adaptation will not feature him at all and we will just see the events directly.

Hopefully non-book-readers didn't have trouble following the two timelines?"
The Luminaries,"It's just come to my attention that , as well as having this weekly timeslot for 6 weeks, the whole series is available for binge-watching via TVNZ on Demand.  Not sure if there is any interest in weekly threads perhaps for those watching overseas without access to TVNZ On Demand ? Or if I should also make a ""whole series spoiler"" thread."
The Luminaries,Looking forward to this but not sure where it will air here
The Luminaries,Any idea where/if it can be seen in the US?
The Luminaries,i dont feel represented in the cast so i have to skip that one.
The Luminaries,"Wasn’t confused by the two timelines at all. Very intriguing— can’t wait to see the rest of the series. 

One of the better first episodes I’ve seen for a while. Man the music and sound design is very cool!"
The Luminaries,Wish us Aussie folks could watch this!
The Luminaries,No idea sorry... tried netflix?
The Luminaries,"Haha, on that topic I'm not sure if there would have been any people of Indian ethnicity speaking English with a pure British accent in 1865 ? The British Raj had only just been established ."
The Luminaries,"Awesome!

I've watched the whole series now so I won't say anything more but I'm pretty happy and have to read the book again now , lol"
The Luminaries,Hopefully the distributors give legal worldwide viewing options sooner rather than later! It seems like a decent production
The Luminaries,"yeah, no go. Search only seems to bring up BBC One, which is not available in the US"
The Luminaries,"Except that the British East India Company was already running things to some degree from the 1700s.  Plus Indians were already enslaved by Britain as far as I know, so its not completely bonkers as a concept.  Also option of wealthy people sending kids to Britain - the story of Anglo Indians is a real muddle!  I'm so desperate to see this, but can't find it (I'm in Aus), so assuming we won't have it yet.  Need....NZonDemand..."
The Luminaries,Or a clever kind kiwi Rips the series and streams it for the rest of us. In these times of kickdown my patience can't manage a 1 week wait!
The Luminaries,It is completely bonkers. You just said they were slaves you think an Indian man would have a proper education? Money? You know nothing about history of you think this Indian actor would be laughed out of every room. Ridiculous. Made it literally unwatchable.
The Luminaries,"I stopped after 3 episodes.

I liked the main girl, Bono's daughter whose name escapes me. She looked the part and did a good job. 

But it was just slow and it dragged. Bad pacing basically. And I found Eva Green to be a bit typecast - Villainous Vixen in a Corset, ho hum."
The Luminaries,[Saw it early last year when it first came out](https://www.reddit.com/r/television/comments/hoayy8/despite_having_eva_green_and_eve_hewson_at_the/)..... meh.
The Luminaries,So I completed it and forgotten most of it. It had a cool setting but I didn't get most of it.
The Luminaries,"Having recently finished DQ11.... 

The Luminary...."
The Luminaries, the biggest victim is Adam :(
The Luminaries,"Now that I know that Rob was Adele, I'm surprised Adele wasn't funnier."
The Luminaries,[deleted]
The Luminaries,"Why would Rob be so in love or obsessed with David? Why wouldn't he just dump David as soon as he took over Adele's body and keep the fortune to himself, free to get high for the rest of his life without scrutiny?"
The Luminaries,"The supernatural twist basically makes the show memorable, otherwise it's quite usual domestic thriller. In the book, the supernatural elements are kept pretty vague until the final chapters. Whereas the show does a better job in introducing them slowly but surely."
The Luminaries,It was bad and I hated Louise. She got herself killed over some dick 😂like she got involved with some shit that didn’t concern her in the slightest and she was so stupid in the end I just didn’t care at all. It wasn’t believable at all.
The Luminaries,[deleted]
The Luminaries,Girl got herself killed over some dick 🤷🏻‍♀️
The Luminaries,The ending was just...what the fuck was even the point of the journey?
The Luminaries,[deleted]
The Luminaries,"So how did David straighten things out with the police? I didn't understand that. Did he just go up to them and say: ""hey listen this woman from London sent you a letter telling you I dumped a body in a well but you shouldn't believe her cause it's all a misunderstanding!""? Why was he so relaxed with Louise sending that letter to the police in the first place? I really didn't get that. I would be livid if someone falsely accused me of murder."
The Luminaries,"This series wasn’t perfect, but it delivered the best twist ending in a long time!
At first, I rolled my eyes when astral projection was first introduced - but then it all started to make sense. I couldn’t figure out how Louise was going to get into the house to save Adele, & it took me a minute to have it register when she blanked out & then knew where the spare key was hidden. I didn’t know astral projectors could switch bodies(admittedly my knowledge in that area is pretty limited!) so it just starting dawning on me when Louise got to Adele. Than it all made such perfect sense! Rob was a very troubled soul, & calling him a psychopath is not a stretch. Yes, he loved Adele, but he also envied her. She was kind to him, & certainly the only friend he ever had. But a psychopath doesn’t let things like that deter him. We were clued in that he was gay early on, which served the plot well, because it eliminated the pitfall of any sexual relationship between Rob & Adele. He had known only rejection & cruelty all his life, so the beautiful, kind, trusting young heiress Adele must have seemed like a fairy tale princess to him. We saw his attraction to David early on, as well as the fear that David would take Adele out of his life. Drug rehab was a joke to Rob - he liked taking drugs & never intended to quit. When he was able to escape his miserable life at his sister’s & actually go to Adele’s estate, it was a dream come true. He wanted to stay there, but knew it would never happen. David & Adele were in love. They were getting married. When David was there, she only had eyes for him. And Rob had his eyes on David, too. So, when He learned astral projection & found people might be able to switch, he went for it. As Rob, he had nothing. As Adele, he had money, an estate, instant position in society - and David. I don’t think David knew that Adele was really Rob. He was a doctor, & his scientific mind would not accept astral projection & body switching. All he knew was that his wife was changed, different, & he likely chalked it up to mental illness, hence all the meds. It sounded like he knew she had done drugs, but not that she was currently shooting up between her toes. But he sensed this was not really Adele, just as Adam quickly sensed that this Louise was not really his mother. Of course, at some point David will also realize that. 
The fascinating thing is, Rob could go on like this indefinitely, if he laid off the smack, learned some discretion & played his cards right. Who says only vampires can live forever?"
The Luminaries,I binge watched it...the ending ruined it for me. If I wanted to watch The Skeleton Key again I would.
The Luminaries,"Louise makes me want to stop watching the whole time, she makes several of the most dipshit decisions.."
The Luminaries,Why did Louise go into Adeles body though? She could've just chilled and then any chance Adele/Rob came out of her body she could steal it back. That's a good plot for a season 2.......reveal that Louise's soul escaped and is floating around waiting for the chance to get her body back lol
The Luminaries,"This whole thing was so aesthetically pleasing, I watched all episodes in one day.  Adele was mesmerizing to watch.  When Lo said she’s tired of bing a good person I felt that.  Adam took a lose."
The Luminaries,"Louise was an idiot. I mean a PURE idiot. Girl what are you doing? You're doing too much as a side chick, you doing too much as a crime sleuth, you doing too much as a captain save a hoe. And why tf are you tryna save a hoe that you received multiple warnings to stay away from and you just found out that she threw someone down a well, threatened somebody else's cat, been astral spying on you, and manipulated the hell out or you. Why you sooooo dumb? And Rob, joke's on you. You dont know nothing about twist outs, wash and go's, the importance of sleeping in a scarf or on satin, or any of the other weight that comes with being a black lady. Also, how is it good to impersonate someone by immediately being an asshole? Get your life together, asshole. K I'm done, this show made me mad but I enjoyed it lol. Great acting all around."
The Luminaries,"I get the sense this would have been much more effective if it was adapted as a film, rather than a six hour series. A lot of the unnecessary red herrings could be cut, and the resulting need to focus might have forced the David/Rob relationship to be telegraphed a bit more clearly."
The Luminaries,i liked it honestly though i can understand why some people probably dont. overall i think that the show is saved by the incredible actors as well as some of the settings/sets of the show. i hope that there isnt a season 2 because as a stand alone mini series it really isnt too bad at all and its easy to finish binge watching.
The Luminaries,"The ending pissed me off because it went for an ending where the villain ultimately wins after spending most of its time giving us reasons to love those characters. Rob isn’t really properly set up as anti-hero, so when he pulls off his diabolical plot you don’t exactly feel good about it at all. Idk I guess I thought it would feel more like Gone Girl where, yeah of course Amy is evil, but a part of you still sort of wants her to win? I ended up just regretting I watched this series. Louise, Adele, Adam, and David all deserved better or to at the very least eventually see Rob get what he deserved."
The Luminaries,"I realized it was Rob inside of Adele when they show that scene of him telling Adele he’d found something new, “Adele” and Rob were too similar, the OG Adele didn’t want to try heroin, and rob knew how to cook well. Rob also displayed obvious symptoms of narcissism throughout the story, from stealing money from his sister to saying he didn’t even want to quit heroin, also displaying massive amounts of jealousy towards Adele’s lifestyle."
The Luminaries,"Why does David give ""Adele"" that old crap phone and credit card in one of the earlier episode? Did they explain why he confiscated them or why exactly he rang her at the same time every day?"
The Luminaries,I loved it. It could have been an episode or 2 shorter though
The Luminaries,I didn’t really understand why Rob did what he did...was it because he was after Adele’s money or because he’s in love with David?
The Luminaries,All im saying is the cops would have gotten to that house faster than i would have if i was louise. Like they had to have all been at lunch
The Luminaries,"Is it really just a coincidence David was at Adele's house the night of the fire? Do we think David set fire to Adele's house while she was astral projecting elsewhere? 

They mentioned his family was not well off. He could've been looking for a way to access Adele's family fortune. I know the writers meant to make him look like a villain to throw us off, but I still find there to be something off about him, even after finishing the show."
The Luminaries,"Can someone explain what were Louise’s night terrors about? She saw pills spilling on the floor and held someone’s hand as they seemed they were dying. At first I thought it was her Mom’s death :( but at the end of the show I am wondering if it has anything to do with Louise’s real death in Adele’s body. Louise’s death scene on the bed looked very similar to Louise’s nightmares, at least visually. Was Louise having a premonition?"
The Luminaries,i thought that David Fucked ROBB in the House and adele found out about them :v well fuck me iwas wrong
The Luminaries,"Lmao, I'm sorry but what was Louise planning to do when she astral projected into the house to save the supposed Adele, like we all know she was just going to witness a suicide. 

I guess in a way though it might make sense, since she may be trying to observe a way to get in the house, but no she just had to go watch her lay there."
The Luminaries,I must have missed something that said Louise was definitely dead? Is she? Otherwise it would have been good to keep her in a coma or something so there was the possibility of her coming back for retribution in season 2.
The Luminaries,"Okay just finished binging it from last night (loved it!) but a few questions ..

SPOILERS

1) I notice Adele wears white mostly ... kinda like how they did in the rehab/psych hospital ... this must be some kind of metaphor for being trapped. Anything think this too?

2) Adele says you can only astral project if you can visualize the place you’ve been to ... would this mean that I’d you’re blind you wouldn’t be able to?

3) why would Adele/rob want to take over Louise’s body anyway? Start over again with David? He’ll be sure to notice the second time that she’s not acting like Louise just like Adele wasn’t acting like Adele

4) Didnt rob/Adele love being rich , part of why he took over Adele’s body .. so he ditched all of that to be Louise ? Was it all just for David after all?

5) did rob ever actual care for the real Adele? His notebook/journal sounded sincere .."
The Luminaries,"Not gonna lie the ending and last half of this show is so stupid. Out of nowhere they introduce this supernatural element, and then they use it to make a mindfuck ending that is actually super stupid and makes no sense. We literally know that all you can do when you are in that supernatural state is that you can observe and watch people. Wtf was Louisa thinking? She would go in that state and watch Adele burn? Like??? They literally made her so dumb at the end, just for a twist. They could have easily made Adele(Rob) manipulate her more to distrust David again and then trick her into doing that thing. Not to mention Adele killed an innocent man, why would she save Adele? What was the reason?"
The Luminaries,so did adele set up the fire or was it truly an accident??! now that i know the rest wasn’t her i’m conflicted
The Luminaries,"Great review. This series was in some ways something quite special and unique... And in others it missed the mark... It's not that I'm upset without a happy ending, it's that the plot/dialogue is at many points just really weird in a sort of mediocre kind of way... Something about the series felt special for sure, though."
The Luminaries,The ending was way too similar to Us by Jordan Peele
The Luminaries,"Why would louise set herself up for the Astral switch at the end ? Seemed too unreal to be true. She could have waited for the cops or simply broken in another way, Adele simply got lucky. 
Apart from that scene, pretty gripping."
The Luminaries,This show was a total waste of my time. So dragged out and the acting gave me nothing. Script was so bad and unengaging as well.
The Luminaries,"the show is little ridiculous to want us to believe that  that character would do all that for a man they just met I'd say it's homophobia but tbh it's just bad soapy writing, both from the show and orginal source. I wish the show /book had laid more groundwork where the motivation to be this committed to be with david abd wanting his love made sense. Otherwise it's just oh those unbalanced gay ppl they will do anything to get their object of obsession. And also does this mean the diary was also fake and only there to mislead and set a trap to lead to the final event. In that case why the missing pages at the end of the diary? I mean all in all half the ppl would be satisfy with the pet food otherwise laugh would just laugh their ass off at the ridiculousness of it all but I guess at least it's something out of the box lol"
The Luminaries,[deleted]
The Luminaries,"Just curious, is Louis(Adele's body) actually dead, or in a coma, or in prison?"
The Luminaries,Man I hate it! I want my money back netflix.
The Luminaries,"Can someone confirm why David was always giving Adele/Rob meds and checking in on her whereabouts etc? I’m confused as to why Rob as Adele acted so strangely all that time and just made David suspicious? In hindsight, wouldn’t it make more sense of Rob to put an act on as Adele and try super hard to be like her?"
The Luminaries,"makes me think, if David wasn't such a good looking charming guy, Rob probably would have killed him so that he can stay with Adele forever."
The Luminaries,Let’s not forget that Rob could also cook and that’s why he was constantly making meals as Adele trying to get David to be in love with him. Just a fun little detail I missed on my first watch!
The Luminaries,"I’m surprised no one is talking about Adele (rob) calling louise and Louise telling Adele what David is going to do and that she told the police. None of this would of started if Adele didnt tell rob hoe to astral project. it freaked me out when Adele was smiling In Louise’s body I think that was the freakiest parts. Plus the part when adele was picking up Adam from the dads house in the last part and Adam knowing quickly that’s something up with his mom he didn’t even run to her like he usually does, plus Adele(Louise) didn’t even hug or have open arms with him. I’ve gotta say rob is pretty F’ed up honestly thinking about It I wondered why Adele was so happy and fun loving with David in the past and in the present she looked like dead in side. I knew something was off and realized that Adeles body soul is robs, I wish Adele never told rob about astral projecting. Rob was a vibrant character as well in the beginning and it’s interesting how in Adele’s body he’s very monotone. I congratulate the writers bc I’m still shocked it’s definitely expect the unexpected type of show . Poor David and Adam is what I gotta say. Honestly I wish Louise had stopped seeing him the minute they had sex but she continued to do it while being Friends did with Adele ughhh come on Louise I know your lonely but your ex literally did the same thing to you for another women. It’s also interesting that David waited 10 years to say anything?? And what happened to adeles body ? Is she dead ? Robs body probably died from the “overdose” and fall. Thinking back in the past David should of left Adele long time ago and call the police he literally just finished school and had to deal with a messed up life?? It’s also interesting that he told Louise everything in public ??? Like ok bud u trust her after everything ??? There were parts that were super confusing for example why did Adele give Louise Adams book that still baffles me cuz she new Louise was banging her man ?? Omg I just finished this show as u can tell!!"
The Luminaries,"
What I was confused about was the fact that David would call home to see where Adele was if he wasn’t in love with her any more"
The Luminaries,Ok wild thought: couldn’t Louise in Adele’s body astro-project out before Adele’s body died... and then just hang around Rob in Louise’s body and wait until rob astro-projected next and jump back in?
The Luminaries,"Didn't know anything about the book or the show prior to watching it on Netflix. It's slow but I am a fan of those type of shows so it did well for me. For a few hours.

But the ending is such a shit-show that I am still pissed off that I spent 6 hours of my life watching that crap. 

The moment I saw some sparkling thing flying around I just could not believe what I was seeing. Up to that part it was a good, slow-building possibly shocking crime story which could turn really interesting.

Instead, we got a C-level half SF half mystery show with an embarassing ending. Louis lying by the door, falling asleep and trying to get into Adele's head to do what exactly? Tell her to get out? Just call the fucking fire brigade, jesus.

Besides for the show ending so hillarious, the characters were great, especially Adele with her crazy AF facial expressions etc. 

2/10"
The Luminaries,**headache* uggggggggggggghhhh!!! 😩
The Luminaries,Has anyone ever experienced astral projection IRL? Growing up my dad would claim he went to pay a visit to so and so or even me when I was in boarding school.. One day one of my mum's friends who can also do astral projection came over and asked my dad to stop visiting her and she is perfectly safe..I thought that was all BS as my hometown is a bit bonkers but after watching this show it made me realise maybe my dad was never lying
The Luminaries,"Overall the show was trash, just finished it and I'm on my phone so I don't want to write a long review."
The Luminaries,"So I love the plot twist but didn't like how it was delivered. When Rob body switched with Adele in the flashback, it was consensual, both knew what they were doing. I didn't really get how he was able to do it with Louise unwillingly. I get her body was vacant, and he could just slip right in. But how would she had known to enter Adele's body? The twist is a little similar to the bly manor dream plot, but at least they threw in the ""tucked in"" aspect. This felt way more forced."
The Luminaries,Do you think David ever guessed the truth about her/Rob? If not why did he hate her so much?
The Luminaries,"Rob's care for Adele was entirely rooted in the fact that he saw how kind she truly was as an individual. She signed her entire fortune away to a man , who could really have killed her parents. Rob desperately wanted David to be a nut-case and THEN plot on ways to convince Adele to leave him. He knew Adele really empathised with him as a drug addict from the unfortunate side of town, and capitalised on this knowledge. Ultimately, he did not like being the unfortunate drug addict, he wanted to be a fortunate drug addict. 

I think he was definitely a psychopath and was ready to do anything to keep his relationship with her (Adele). He quickly fell in love with David, like they literally showed him clutching his heart when David touched his shoulder , before going up to meet Adele. 
At some point, I believe he was suicidal because he saw how in love Adele was with David and him (David) with her and knew his proximity to her lifestyle would have to quickly end. So there was no way he could properly infiltrate her life with his physical presence without her ultimately becoming wary of him and remembering where they met and seeing the naivety of her acceptance of him(with David's help ofcourse). He said it so many times that she would soon forget him and the reality is she would have. They would probably have sold that estate , due to the fire that happened. the astral projection moment was his golden ticket. They both couldn't believe it worked but he quickly realised how he could use it to his advantage and trucked the deuces up to Adele. his decision was Adele as a friend or be Adele. His life was pretty miserable and quite frankly as a married woman, he would have had less access to Adele over-time and consequently the proximity to the lifestyle.

Louise and the original Adele were similar I believe. So Rob already had the experience required to manipulate her. I am so mad she didnt just stay her ass at home and let Robele burn to a crisp. I mean she knew the extent of her(his) madness , so why attend a gun fight with a broom? A frail broom at that?! She was a newbie acting like she knew ish and now look!

I was really spun by this series especially because I mostly just had it on in the background when it seemed like just another ""wife finds out her husband is cheating and befriends the mistress to convince her to leave said husband alone"" series. Loved it, definitely didnt see the plot-twist fully unfolding this way!"
The Luminaries,The only thing that peeved me off was Louise’s decision to ASTRAL PROJECT when there’s a bloody fire going on with fake Adele obviously still inside! How useful did they she think she was gonna be whilst not in her body!? Could have avoided the entire body swap tbh. But whatever plot convenience yada yada
The Luminaries,It's like what would happen if Stephen King wrote a Gillian Flynn story without capturing the magic of either.
The Luminaries,"can someone explain to me all of the episodes where Rob talked about being in love with Adele and how he wrote about how in love with her he was? Why was he so obsessed with her in the rehab place, if he was actually obsessed with David? i am so confused"
The Luminaries,Nobody going to talk about how Adele is clearly in the body of a pigeon?
The Luminaries,"Do we ever find out what was on the torn out pages in the notebook?

Also, when Adele is watching David and Louise have their convo and you can tell the orb is in the room, it looks like pink/purple hue, not a blue one."
The Luminaries,Double woman in a refrigerator.
The Luminaries,"Was enjoyable but I hated the ending. The ""depraved homosexual"" trope is too overused. Further still, it would have been much better storytelling if they never explicitly told us that it was Rob all along and instead we were left to wonder."
The Luminaries,"remember in the start when David had to stop traditionally fucking Adele/Rob, & switch to anal (heavily suggested in scene).  Rob can get off being fucked in his/her vag, but every so often he wants a bit of the old anal.  He switched w/Adele, & then Adele to Louise, because he liked the money = access to heroin = player status.  David very suspicious when Adele would cook because Real Adele inept & Rob a helluva cook.

    My Qs:  did David know Adele was Rob?  When & how? What wefe exact deets of Scotland fire & rescue.?

Perhaps the best bad series of the covid stay at home?  But Your Horror neck & neck."
The Luminaries,"The problem with the show was that it dragged. I've read the book too, but found the show just kind of relies on the ending to make the rest of the episodes makes sense.
Plus don't get me started on the slightly homophobic overtones to it..."
The Luminaries,"Need to come here as I really felt bad with the ending. I really felt sorry for the true Adele, her story was the most sad, she lost her parents, she trusted Rob so much yet he betrayed and killed her and she and Adam were so in love yet Rob ruined their chance of happinness.. Adele’s the real and biggest victim :("
The Luminaries,"Rob got himself a free n-worf pass lmao. Rip Adam though, best case scenario is that Rob in Louise's body overdoses or something and social security allows him to go live with his dad and ""Lisa?"""
The Luminaries,"I agree; the supernatural elements were some of the most interesting aspects of the show. I actually thought that Adam knew about Adele’s astral projecting at first because (I forget which scene) Adam tells Louise that she “shines.” If you pay attention, later in the series, “Adele” (really Rob, ew) tells Louise she was waiting to find someone who “shined” too. When Adele said that, Louise markedly pulls back, seeming to recall Adam’s earlier words to her. I thought maybe Adele, Adam, and Rob all “shined” and that’s what formed the basis of that seemingly unbreakable bond. All of the “shining” references instantly made me think of Stephen King and some of his creations—foremost, Castle Rock. Ultimately, the show didn’t go in that direction per se but that theme definitely piqued my interest."
The Luminaries,My question - why the f did Louise go into astral form anyways at the end? It's not like she can physically carry her or wake her. She can only observe.. or am I missing something here?
The Luminaries,"i didn't understand why ""Adele"" had heroin until the ending. super weird but a pretty good series"
The Luminaries,That last look of dismay on his face breaks my heart😭
The Luminaries,"I like to believe that the bird we see at the end hosts her soul. And she is flying around the world trying to find her son again and claim her body back. And once the honeymoon is over and the problems in the relationship with Rob start to surface again,  he starts to travel out of his body again, she will claim her life back."
The Luminaries,"The ending pissed me off so much that when I knew where it was going, I turned it off. I have exactly 11 mins left. Then I went to google and confirmed it and then the whole Rob/Adele thing. Louise really should’ve stayed out of it but beyond that did they really need to kill her? Seriously as a mom, that hit wrenched me and I couldn’t anymore."
The Luminaries,I feel for Adam so much as someone who had her mom die at age 10. The difference is he's never gonna know the truth
The Luminaries,"Nah at least he isn't dead, his live is ruined but is say its Louise s she was a mother"
The Luminaries,"Absolutely. Rob-Adele definitely seemed extra robotic. I know Rob was acting very awkward around David, but it was like RA had 0 personality around David which was super odd, especially if we are to buy the notion that Rob is a master manipulator who managed to have both Adele and Louise completely under his influence like that.

Also another petty but hilarious complaint is accents. I would imagine IRL RA would struggle to have to sound so posh all the time (imitating Adele's accent) and every time RA was alone they'd be all ""fookin ellll"" lol."
The Luminaries,This.
The Luminaries,"Same. But has been ten years since the body swap, so probably he lost his humour while the wedding was rotting"
The Luminaries,Wasn't he receiving medications through Adele that kinda messed him up more?
Monster Girl Doctor,"Capaldi's run is going to age well as more people go back and binge it.  His character arc is, imo, the best character arc any Doctor has ever had, but most people didn't really pick up on it, either because of the weekly format, or because they felt they already knew who the Doctor was and didn't like him having a character arc.

Capaldi's run dismantles the Doctor, examines every piece, allows him to make mistakes in his pursuit of figuring out who the Doctor is, and what a good man is, and then slowly builds him up even greater than before."
Monster Girl Doctor,"""The writing failed Capaldi."" How many times have I heard that from viewers who dropped off after a couple Capaldi episodes? It is one of the worst misconceptions the modern series has ever had. No not even close. If anyone was failed by the writing, it was Smith with the convoluted plot lines and turned the Doctor into an all-knowing superhero. 

Capaldi's era took a look at who the Doctor is and deconstructs what they should be after Tennant and Smith's characterization. It's the best character arc the Doctor has gone through. From angry, old man questioning his existence to Rockstar co-dependent on his companions to the final, evolved version of the modern portrayal. You couldn't imagine other Doctor's going through Listen, Heaven Sent, World and Time Enough, or The Doctor Falls. 

After multiple series of universe ending threats, Moffat does something unthinkable. He scales it all down. Series 8 deals with afterlife culminating in the Doctor deciding who he is - an idiot with a box. Series 9 shows the Doctor at his most wounded and deconstructs Moffat's own universe ending plot lines. Series 10's finale is the ultimate statement of the character. The Doctor is just a time traveling alien who walks right into unexpected trouble. 

And each series has its own range of great episodes to all-timers. 

Series 8 - Deep Breath, Listen (all-timer), Mummy on the Orient Express, Flatline, Dark Water

Series 9 - The Magician's Apprentice/Witches Familiar, Under the Lake/Before the Flood, Zygon Invasion/Zygon Inversion, Face the Raven, Heaven Sent (arguably the GOAT), Hell Bent 

Series 10 - The Pilot, Oxygen, Extremis, World and Time Enough (all-timer), The Doctor Falls (all-timer)

His Christmas Specials are also pretty good. Last Christmas is underrated.  Husbands of River Song is arguably the best Christmas special competing with A Christmas Carol. Return of Doctor Mysterio is a goofy love letter to Superman. And Twice Upon A Time is a quiet, introspective send off to not just Capaldi, but Moffat as well. 

Sorry if I've ranted. I've always been annoyed by the common belief Capaldi's era was somehow significantly worse than the others. I'd argue he had the 2nd golden era of the modern series after Tennant."
Monster Girl Doctor,Capaldi and Tenant both had such great runs as The Doctor. Definitely my 2 favorites.
Monster Girl Doctor,"Capaldi and Smith are the best runs, writing is top, story is top.  No one was failed."
Monster Girl Doctor,One of my favourite scenes in NuWho. Always love seeing callbacks to earlier seasons like this.
Monster Girl Doctor,Still not a ginger :(
Monster Girl Doctor,"It definitely felt like it was almost a retrospective reset of sorts for both the character and Moffat as a showrunner.

I know some people didn’t like it but I loved that after years of Tennant and Smith being all manic and cheekily charming, it was tempered down to a measured and more mature Doctor who has to reevaluate everything he’s done and is after what should’ve been his true end.

He’s still the Doctor with all the expected pathological quirks, but he definitely didn’t announce it as loudly as Tennant asking for a banana or Smith speaking baby.

Casually taps a kid’s head to reset his memory with no fancy speeches or assurances. “Dad Skills”."
Monster Girl Doctor,"The Capaldi run could have been shit (it's not!) and I'd still stan it, if only for Capaldi insisting the Doctor wear a hoody and have sunglasses for a season so that any kid could easily dress up like their hero. That alone? Huge respect."
Monster Girl Doctor,"If I recall correctly, I liked a lot more of the episodes with Bill, because I was always in the camp that Clara overstayed her welcome. Also that episode with the fucking trees. yeah, *more Oxygen* that will stop us from burning."
Monster Girl Doctor,Capaldi himself was incredible. But a lot of his run is ruined by Clara imo.
Monster Girl Doctor,Not just character development for the doctor but also a certain other important one.
Monster Girl Doctor,"I'm not interested in character development for the Doctor. I see Doctor Who as more of an anthology show and the supporting cast should be the main focus of the episodes. Just like how the Mad Max movies aren't actually about Mad Max.

Too much focus on the Doctor is what I don't want to see. I doubt I'll come around to loving the Capaldi era."
Monster Girl Doctor,Heaven Sent is quite possibly my favorite episode of any TV show ever. It’s at least in the top 5
Monster Girl Doctor,"I think the themes of Capaldi's run kinda begin at the 50th anniversary special.  

Obviously, they didn't destroy Galifrey, so as the audience we think ""Doctor saved Galifrey.  Doctor good,"" but it's not so simple.  3 different versions of the Doctor were willing to destroy the planet, willing to burn all those people, and were only stopped from doing so by Clara reminding him to ""Be a Doctor.""  The willingness to destroy Galifrey wasn't something that afterwards could be simply blamed on a rogue regeneration of the Doctor.  It was something within The Doctor's core character that transcended regeneration.  

So, Capaldi's self-reflection and self-doubt on the question of deep-down, ""Am I a good man"" is a natural and reasonable one for the character to have at this time.  The rest of his arc is trying out several different answers to that question, usually ending in some sort of failure.  For example, one of the ideas he tries is good works, thinking a good man is simply doing good works.  It fails.  Finally, the Doctor comes to the conclusion of his arc and what makes a good man in his [standoff with the two Masters](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnouj9Yz-Gs).  ""Above all, it's kind.  It's just that.  Just kind.""

Then, in his last speech, he sums up everything he's learned and what it means to be The Doctor.  ""[Never be cruel.  Never be cowardly](https://youtu.be/yJqsPBWbtjk?t=61).  Notice how that's a direct callback to the 50th and the ""Be a Doctor"" scene when Clara asks ""[You told me the name you chose was a promise.  What was the promise?](https://youtu.be/gPu9XtfEicM?t=141)""

That's what makes a good man, and that's who the Doctor is.  Just being kind is what a good man is, and never being cruel, never being cowardly, never eating pears, always trying to be nice, but never failing to be kind, is who the Doctor is."
Monster Girl Doctor,"What the hell, I watched his whole run and never once noticed he wore a hoodie for one of the series. Blowing my mind rn"
Monster Girl Doctor,"Clara probably should have died off a little earlier than she did.  

However, I think a lot of the negative perception of Clara is colored by assuming that the Doctor is always right.  The Doctor isn't always right though.  The Doctor builds her up as ""The Impossible Girl"" as though she's super-special and kind of a Mary Sue.  Except she's not, we find out that she's just a regular, simple girl.  She's an everyman.  The show goes to great lengths to show us that Clara is just a regular, simple girl, and yet, we somehow still have this perception of her as a Mary Sue because the Doctor's incorrect assumptions of her."
Monster Girl Doctor,"I definitely would've liked it if we said goodbye to Clara for good after one season of Capaldi.

I also really wanted at least ONE episode of Capaldi-Doctor meeting Donna Noble. They'd have an amazing snark-off and she could get mildly distressed because he seems familiar to her and she feels like she can remember his face but not from *where*. Not saying she should've been the companion, but him just bumping into her for one episode would've been nice."
Monster Girl Doctor,I think Clara leaving to return that kid Danny killed to his parents was a great stepping off point. Clara's story could have ended there. And I'd have been happy. Then she was in the Christmas Special. And the following season. And it just felt like she overstayed her welcome.
Monster Girl Doctor,YES. The #1 reason why I jumped ship.
Monster Girl Doctor,It's basically a Capaldi One Man Show too. Just pure acting.
Monster Girl Doctor,Funnily enough that's the last episode of Doctor Who I've ever watched.
Monster Girl Doctor,"I like that take, but it is an odd join with the very beginning of the 50th where Clara starts off with a Marcus Aurelius quote on “Waste no more time arguing what a good man should be. Be one.”

On one hand, it could be a clash with Aurelius’ stoicism since the very fact that the Doctor questions it is part of what makes him a good man, setting himself from the tip of narcissism and being the Time Lord Victorious.

On the other, it could also be seen as a quote to remind that the Doctor never truly forgot his promise, but rather he only needs to remember to move forward with the core values of it. It’s tonally subtle"
Monster Girl Doctor,I feel like you're forgetting one more vital message from Capaldi's final speech as the Doctor.
Monster Girl Doctor,Its more that a hoodie is added to his revolving choice of outfits after a certain point in his tenure
Monster Girl Doctor,"> The show goes to great lengths to show us that Clara is just a regular, simple girl

I vehemently disagree. 

The show goes out it's way to make Clara the most important human being who ever lived. She literally saved every incarnation of the doctor at multiple times during the course of his timeline. She's the reason he picked the TARDIS. By the end of the show she's immortal and has her own TARDIS/companion. 

She is very, very much not a regular simple girl."
Monster Girl Doctor,"I think the truly odd join is Time of the Doctor, the episode after the 50th where Smith regenerates. The Doctor defends a planet against overwhelming odds for 900 years! He doubles his age defending innocent people to his literal last breath, and then starts wondering if he's a good man. I still find it baffling."
Monster Girl Doctor,"And I think the show was disagreeing with Aurelius a bit.  Aurelius's quote is a call to action.  It's a call to do something.  Well, what does a good man do?  

What Moffett is saying through the Doctor is that what a good man is isn't entirely in your actions, it's in your being.  Be kind.  If you're kind, even if you fail, like Capaldi's Doctor believed he would taking on the Cybermen in his scene with the two masters, every action you take will be what a good man would do."
Monster Girl Doctor,"She's a regular person who is the most important person in the universe, for a single brief moment.  
Pretty much like Donna.  Not that different from Bad Wolf Rose even.

Clara's brief moment is the moment she jumps into the Doctor's timestream.  

Clara didn't save every incarnation of The Doctor.  An echo of Clara, a Clara who had been ripped into a million pieces, none of those echoes being the real Clara, saved each incarnation of the Doctor.  [Rewatch River Song's warning to Clara before Clara jumps](https://youtu.be/8cZFDtOMYtQ?t=112)."
Monster Girl Doctor,"That one actually makes sense to me. He thinks he’s going to die. Really die. And so he does the one thing, especially that incarnation, he never does—he stays. 

And fights and takes care of one planet for centuries. He’s forced to watch generations pass while he ages, where it must be such a cycle that he loses track of which generation was that little boy Barnabas.

After that much time and a period of not being able to distract himself with a new adventure or planet (especially in the case of 11th Doctor), he has to go over what he’s done in not just the Time War but like Donna or Amy or Adric (poor Adric). That has to have him stop and contemplate"
Monster Girl Doctor,"A wonderful episode examining the question of what it means to be ""The Doctor"".

With Clara adopting the role while The Doctor is stuck, she assumes that to be The Doctor, she must be cold, calculating, and do anything she must to keep control of the group and prevent any deaths.

With The Doctor questioning his morality throughout this series, it allows him to sit back and examine what being The Doctor actually means.

As The Doctor says to Clara in this clip, ""You were good, **and** you made a mighty fine Doctor.""

The concept of being good and being The Doctor are very clearly two mutually exclusive concepts to him, and betrays the conclusion that he has determined from his observations.

Also, while trying to determine what role he plays when he does what he does, he's attempting to figure out what these monsters are, and what role they are playing. 

Ultimately, they are nothing but monsters, and his role, regardless of morality, is to stop them. He implies that he knows that what he's doing will likely kill most of them. He's committing murder, as he so often does when fulfilling his role. Which further raises the question of the series: ""Am I a good man.""

The dialogue for this scene was very well crafted to further the themes running throughout this series, as is typical of Capaldi's era. They're ripe for literary dissection."
Monster Girl Doctor,"I know people love the speeches throughout the Steven Moffat era, but this was one of the few speeches that never really worked for me. Just has a bit of a ""Just get on with it and defeat them and stop talking!"" vibe to me"
Monster Girl Doctor,"Extremely well said. I hope RTD brings Jamie Mathieson back, I wanted him to take over for Moffat, one of my favorite who writers ever"
Monster Girl Doctor,I felt the same. And the way Clara throws the Sonic at 12 was so awkward looking.
Monster Girl Doctor,"People love the speeches? Idk, how many times were you supposed to be in awe because they said “that’s not possible!” Or “that’s impossible!”"

Monster Girl Doctor,"Left out the part where The Doctor stabilizes that chick as a paving stone.

Alive, conscious, stuck in that guy's house pretty much forever. Wholly dependent on him for socialization and locomotion. Probably unable to feel anything past her face and most likely unable to appreciate a wide array of comforts of any kind. 

Probably undying, too. 

Shame."
Monster Girl Doctor,Oh no not this one.
Monster Girl Doctor,Was that Moaning Myrtle?
Monster Girl Doctor,Worst. Episode. Ever.
Monster Girl Doctor,"The only episode I tried to convince my gf to skip on her first watch through the show, this one is really rough."
Monster Girl Doctor,You left out the part where they admit to her and the guy still having a sex life.
Monster Girl Doctor,It is. I had to IMDB it. Shirley Henderson
Monster Girl Doctor,Fear Her? Kill the Moon? Rosa?
Monster Girl Doctor,"First time through, I'd kind of agree. Started a rewatch of the series recently and the episode actually had a lot of charm to it. This scene in particular cracked me up with the exchange about not being from Raxacoricofallapatorius, and instead being from their neighboring planet Klum.

While not a particularly outstanding episode for Doctor Who, the amount of heart it carries is splendid. If you go into it expecting The Impossible Planet or Don't Blink, you're going to come away disappointed. The whole episode is almost like one big joke with the punchline being that making Jackie Tyler cry was a bigger offense than the alien that just murdered four other people."
Monster Girl Doctor,Did your monster not win the Blue Peter competition then?
Monster Girl Doctor,No worse than anything in the last 2 seasons.
Monster Girl Doctor,"Kill the Moon was THE worst, by far."
Monster Girl Doctor,Kill the Moon was the episode that made me drop the series.
Monster Girl Doctor,"I just rewatched this episode and I'd agree! Couldn't stand it first watch, was annoyed and considered skipping but figured it'd be fine for right-before-bed brain-tired tv, and was pleasantly surprised by the amount of heart! ""We forget because we must"" is a great line, and the jokes were actually pretty well timed. Not brilliant, but overall better on a rewatch and I thought it really harnessed some of the charm of older monster-of-the-week style TV."
Monster Girl Doctor,"Yeah, I give this episode a lot of grains of salt due to the fact that it was a child's prize winner idea. Also had great use of music."
Monster Girl Doctor,I don't even remember that one.
Monster Girl Doctor,There is something to be said for that....
Monster Girl Doctor,I looked up the synposis... wow that sounds aweful.
Monster Girl Doctor,Marc Warren is great though.
Monster Girl Doctor,Classic Who fan here: the Sea Devils were the sea-dwelling cousins of The Silurians who were the original inhabitants of the Earth who sought shelter from a planetary impact millions of years ago. First seen in the early 1970's when Jon Pertwee played the Doctor.
Monster Girl Doctor,"This is a big deal for Classic Who fans. The last time the Sea Devils appeared was in ""Warriors of the Deep"", in 1984 (Fifth Doctor, Season 21)."
Monster Girl Doctor,I want doctor who to bring back that bad guy made from sweets https://youtu.be/Qkjc_5yGCmM
Monster Girl Doctor,Bring back the Meddling Monk
Monster Girl Doctor,"The real monster, returning for the last time, is Chibnall"
Monster Girl Doctor,Really can’t wait till RTD comes back. Haven’t been interested in DW since Smith left
Monster Girl Doctor,[deleted]
Monster Girl Doctor,"Alright! And they look so authentic to their originally design.

I have to admit I was concerned when I heard this (especially as to my knowledge Chibnal was part of the driving force behind the drastic redesign of the Silurians which I both never liked and always felt missed the point of them), but it looks good.

The Sea Devils are iconic for a good reason. Coupled with other factors this might actually be a good return.

I have to be honest, I haven't actually watched a single recent episode. I still consider myself a fan, but I'd more or less resided myself to ignoring the rest until Chibnal is gone and RTD is back.

But this is actually making me hopeful."
Monster Girl Doctor,"Will this be solely written by Chibnall, meaning there's no hope for it whatsoever, or will there be a co-writer, meaning it might turn out well -- at least in part -- like ""Fugitive of the Judoon"" and ""Village of the Angels"" did? I swear to glob, ""Village"" was almost like we had proper Doctor Who back again! I suspect Chibs only wrote the segments of ""Village"" set elsewhere, outside of the village, with Bel/Vinder et al."
Monster Girl Doctor,"Over the years I’ve only watch a couple of episodes. Where would be the best point in the whole series to start a binge watch? Help me , I need this."
Monster Girl Doctor,"> a planetary impact millions of years ago.

Stupid cybermen."
Monster Girl Doctor,"I can't believe there's never been a DW story set pre-asteroid impact when the Silurians and Sea Devils populated the Earth. Obviously to capture it in scale would be way beyond BBC budget, but you can set in a few bases with a couple of outside CG shots. There's a lot of narrative potential there, especially with how connected the Doctor is to Earth. Does her interest extend to the other two native sentient races?"
Monster Girl Doctor,Thanks. I never watched early Who but I'm a huge fan now.
Monster Girl Doctor,"Then why the redesign isn't looking ""connected"" to the Silurians got?"
Monster Girl Doctor,Yeah but bring back the myrka or no balls.
Monster Girl Doctor,"Not really. The Sea Devils are boring versions of the Silurians. This is one of those things where people just want a reference to the old stuff to feel vindicated and go ""Oh, I know where that's from"" rather than it being anything good."
Monster Girl Doctor,The Other
Monster Girl Doctor,"Still one episode left after this, which is the regen episode. We aren't away with him just yet."
Monster Girl Doctor,"I know Reddit really does like to circlejerk about Capaldi, the Doctor immediately after Smith, but his episodes **are** pretty good.

If you're interested, I'd say ""Time Heist"" from Series 8 is a very good standalone episode with him. ""Mummy on the Orient Express"" from S8 is good as well, and the finale is enjoyable, but it's the finale and a two-parter.

Series 9 is arguably my favorite of all modern Doctor Who, **solely** because every episode, with the exception of one, is a two-parter. The The finale is meant to be a two-part, but I argue that ""Face the Raven"" ties into well enough that it's a three-parter. Anyways, Series 9 is really good."
Monster Girl Doctor,"If you stopped around then I’d suggest giving the Capaldi-Era a watch. 

His first series is a bit inconsistent and it felt like they couldn’t *quite* figure out who he is but it rapidly improved. He’s got an alien irreverence that channels just the right amount of Malcom Tucker to be hilarious. Jenna Coleman also has way more chemistry with Capaldi than Smith so their dynamic drastically improves.

Series 9 is arguably one of the best of the revived show and it’s penultimate episode (Heaven Sent) has achieved legendary status with a good number calling it the best episode of the entire run of the show."
Monster Girl Doctor,"Doctor Who monsters retaining that element of ""We have exactly three quid for suits so it's gonna be a little naff and you need to accept that"" after so many decades will always be a positive."
Monster Girl Doctor,Chibnall pissed off the old team so he fired them or they quit.
Monster Girl Doctor,It's co-written by Ella Road
Monster Girl Doctor,Shame Adric never got to know if he was right.
Monster Girl Doctor,[This audiobook](https://youtu.be/PydI4MbPl-o) of an official Target paperback has a small scene from those days.
Monster Girl Doctor,"There's a ton of cool stories from the Classic era (63-89). Three Doctors, Genesis of the Daleks, Black Orchid, The Visitation, Pyramids of Mars, Terror of the Autons, The Krotons, Keys of Marinus, Mark of the Rani, Trial of a Timelord..."
Monster Girl Doctor,The sea devils and the silurians never looked alike
Monster Girl Doctor,And then lovely Russell T. Davies coming back to make everything okay again. :)
Monster Girl Doctor,Huzzah! Thank the (Time) Lord(s).
Monster Girl Doctor,"I remember that story - ""Earthshock"". End credits had no music and it was a picture of Adric's broken Gold Star."
Monster Girl Doctor,"I'm sure, but I can't get past the old video quality. I couldn't even re-watch one of my favorite shows until they tweaked it, and it's not nearly as old (Babylon Five)"
Monster Girl Doctor,Also I liked how the Dalek 2-parter during the Capaldi era had a callback to Genesis of the Daleks from like 50 years earlier. That has to be one of the longest callbacks in TV history lol.
Monster Girl Doctor,"Yeah, for back then that was some mind-blowing shit.  The Doctor's companion, a mere boy, dies, the Doctor and everyone around him takes in the horror, and the credits roll."
Monster Girl Doctor,"Did you start right at the beginning with the first Doctor, Hartnell? Because a lot of that video is super rough. I would start at the Fourth Doctor era if you try again. It's obviously not up to par with modern productions but it's a vast improvement from the early seasons."
Monster Girl Doctor,"I feel like Moffatt went to that well a little bit too often. The girl in the fireplace, the whole multiple Clara storyline, heaven sent/hell bent - he was always writing stories about how jumping around the Timeline and/or living for a long time changes your perspective on life and death. Don't get me wrong, it's a great theme to explore on doctor who, but by the time it got to Ashildr, it felt like there wasn't much left for him to say."
Monster Girl Doctor,I love Me.
Monster Girl Doctor,Not wasted. She was never intended to be in more than 1 season. She was there to show the consequences of the doctor making a human immortal and how it backfires. That was it.
Monster Girl Doctor,"Yeah, this really felt like Moffat trying to make his own Jack Harkness but she didn't get nearly enough screen time to pull it off. 

It'd be great to see her developed more in the new RTD era, or at least Big Finish."
Monster Girl Doctor,Maybe with RTD he will bring her back.
Monster Girl Doctor,"I'm really intrigued by what RTD wants to do with his Cinematic universe MCU style approach that's been rumored. 

Charecters from the moffat era like her and Clara getting their little spinoff would be cool, same with if we got a full series for strax and vastra doing their mystery solving stuff, although I could see him sticking with stuff from his own era and doing something with Jenny the Doctors Daughter, or maybe he'll create new characters to give spinoffs like with Jack and Torchwood, or maybe he'll do something like the Sarah Jane Adventures and do something with an older favorite. 

The one I really hope we get is one I came up with in a different reddit comment a while ago where we get a series of multi doctor specials where they trade companions around so we could get stuff like Amy and Rory with Capaldi, or Martha with Eccelstone, or Clara with Tennant, etc."
Monster Girl Doctor,Valhalla Morghulis
Monster Girl Doctor,"She wasn't a wasted character at all.  Capaldi's arc was all about deconstructing the character of the Doctor, examining all the parts, and then putting the Doctor back together in his most pure form.

Ashildr was there as a vehicle to give the Doctor an excuse to break his rules, so it could be examined why he has those rules in the first place.  Job done."
Monster Girl Doctor,It would've been good if the actress was better at acting.
Monster Girl Doctor,"He *really* liked to do the ""mysterious woman who is obsessed with the Doctor waits for/tracks him down across time and space"" story. That broadly describes Amy, River, Clara, Missy, Lorna Bucket, Tasha Lem, Ashildr, Madame de Pompadour, Kovarian, Sally Sparrow, Queen Elizabeth I etc. lol"
Monster Girl Doctor,[deleted]
Monster Girl Doctor,"I don't think she's meant to be like Harkness at all. She's basically the flip side of the Doctor's immortality. The whole point of S9 is the Doctor getting extremely attached to mortals to the point of crossing the line and breaking his own values/rules (first with resurrecting Ashildr and then endagering the stability of time with Clara). Me/Ashildr is supposed to be the flip side of that who gradually loses the ability to love anyone or anything. 



The finale culminates in them arguing about this very idea and the Doctor's relationship with Clara at the end of the universe."
given,The cast is dynamite so I hope someone picks it up.
given,Ironically enough that would PERFECTLY fit the show. So hopefully
given,They could easily fit the “Hulu dropped us so we found a new home” story with a new streaming service.
given,If it does I hope we get to see more of Judy Greer on mushrooms.
given,"I'm still in shock that it didn't get renewed. These streaming services need to stop looking at their initial numbers and invest in things that are actually good and trust that audiences will find them eventually.

The reason a lot of those sitcoms like the Office and Friends are streamed is because they have hundreds of episodes in their catalog. Never going to have another show like that if they don't believe in some of their products and give them the benefit of the doubt."
given,"They cancelled this? Gdi, Judy Greer was great in it and I really loved the cast they had."
given,"They could pull off a meta ""Hulu cancelled us"" story if someone else picks them up. It seems too obvious since they actually used Hulu in the first season instead of an unnamed studio. 

I hope it finds another home."
given,This was an amazing show that I binged in one sitting. So surprised it wasn’t renewed.
given,I haven't finished watching season one and now I kind of don't want to.  Getting burnt out on being invested in one season shows.
given,I'm in the minority that thought this show was just okay. I would love to see this exact cast and premise with better writing. i watched it and chuckled a few times but can't say I'm surprised it got pulled.
given,By far my favorite new comedy of last year. That’s a shame.
given,"I hate this show only because it made me say, ""Johnny Knoxville affected me emotionally""   


I seriously never thought he'd get anything other than physical cringes from me and this show changed that perception for me."
given,"I enjoyed the story arch with Johnny Knoxville, very much."
given,Probably one the funniest comedy in recent years. Surpasses Abbot Elementary in my opinion by a longshot.
given,"It's been interesting since that one character is a Hulu employee, so they'd either need to write her out or have her quit"
given,"Ugh I really hope so, but it seems unlikely in the current state if the industry. Even tho this is one of the most egregious cases, basically every streaming service is cutting shows that don’t make any apparent sense because????? profit somehow????? Hard to imagine one of them picking up another’s leftovers. *Maybe* something like Peacock where they really don’t wanna give up but they also still haven’t garnered a huge audience?"
given,Was this always the plan? Are they going to “reboot “ it in a year or so with a new cast?
given,"huh, a post with no title


Edit: What's with the downvotes? It's literally a blank post"
given,What if they cancelled it just so they could reboot it.
given,"Netflix just picked up a peacock comedy Girls5eva, so maybe. But probably not, there are no huge names attached to this and it only has one season. Outlook doesn’t look good"
given,If it happens then I'm sure the show within the show is going to a new network too
given,Judy Greer in general is amazing
given,"They would have had to do 12 more seasons to squeak over 100 episodes.  They don't just need to renew them, they need to give them larger season orders."
given,You can’t compare the two. When friends was still on the air it was without a doubt already mainstream. Something ridiculous like 50 million people tuned in live for the series finale. Whereas the office became mainstream through streaming
given,"> the Office and Friends are streamed is because they have hundreds of episodes

They get that many episodes because they were popular...

The Office was even based on the already popular UK show."
given,"It's not really that bad for this show. It ends on a good note. Also, it's extremely funny. I hate whoever cancelled this show."
given,It's what I expected from a cast of comedic actors and creator Steve Levitan but didn't realize it was TV-MA.
given,"I prefer it a lot more when it was focusing on the writers and producers, but my interest would be drained a bit when it focused on the actors"
given,"Even the comedies on Appletv surpass Abbot, not that hard of a feat"
given,With it only being one character they could have a ton of fun with it… she could stay at Hulu but still want to be friends so the cast think she’s a spy sent to sabotage them. Or the show could use her character to just take a bunch of hits at Hulu. Or she gets a job at the new network and they think she’s stalking and get a restraining order. Or she gets a job as a huge exec at the new network and now is in over her head trying to manage it along with other shows. There’s SO much they could do that would still fit the show.
given,Except it's not?
given,She’s got two golden globes.
given,Okay but what about season 1 of the Office? Take our the pilot and it’s viewership wasn’t great. But they renewed it and good word of mouth meant viewers found the show in between seasons.
given,They weren’t super popular during their first season. Seinfeld and Parks and Rec would have been canceled after season 1 if they were on modern streaming services.
given,Both were nearly canceled in season 1 and didnt gain a followimgbu til seasons 2/3. Same with Parks and Rec.
given,"Yeah I like the show a lot, I'll end up watching it all was just bummed reading it was not renewed."
given,It did end on a semi cliff hanger though. It’s fine to finish but you really don’t have to if it’s not being picked back up.
given,She is the love interest of one of the main characters
given,"It is.

https://i.imgur.com/e8LBA7K.png


No, not running any extensions."
given,Yeah she does.
given,but the ending is fitting
given,No one else sees that then.
given,"Say goodbye to THESE, Michael!"
given,Like 80% of the plotlines are not resolved.
given,"Are you on old reddit, or the shitty new reddit?"
given,( . )(  •)
given,"Fear the Walking Dead, Vikings"
given,Coma seasons of Archer lost me for good. I know it's back on to the original setup but I just don't care anymore.
given,"Did you watch the first three seasons of Arrested Development?  Because if so, that's all you need to watch.  The Netflix seasons are trash."
given,*Whispers* I'm already getting a little bored with Poker Face.
given,Sons of Anarchy
given,"I never finished Grimm, Orphan Black, Black Sails, The L Word, The Originals, I also gave up on Lost. 

All of these shows I enjoyed for at least 3 seasons (except Black Sails, I stopped at 2.) but they started getting stale."
given,"Twin Peaks has an incredible season 3 (The Return) but it's not a show for everyone. If you hated it immediately then don't bother, but if you were perhaps turned off by certain season 2 plot lines I'd vote to try and push through. Up to you though."
given,"Legacies

A dude literally melted into goo after having sex…… plus one of the actors left and I stopped caring about it."
given," at least 80% of those I watched in the last few years, too many to mention honestly. Exponentially more compared to the number I dropped during the 35 years before"
given,The Wilds on Amazon prime. The guys made it weird. Plus I heard sad news ab my fav girls
given,A new one just came out - *Hunters*. Went through 9.5 episodes just to find out I never should have started it.
given,"The Americans.  I have tried so many times to watch that show, probably watched the first 2 seasons 3 or 4 times.  I just could not keep going.  It's not bad, it just comes across as mediocre to me."
given,"What We Do in the Shadows

The Walking Dead

Fargo (season 4 only, first 2 seasons are amazing, especially 1)"
given,"Once Upon A Time. Gave up during Season 6, even though it jumped the shark way earlier. 

The Morning Show. Had one more episode left of S2 but couldn't continue because it felt so self-indulgent, like I was watching these celebs jerk off each other over their acting abilities. 

The Walking Dead, just really bad after Negan entered the scene. 

Russian Doll, watched a few episodes of S2 and the concept was interesting but not enough to justify watching over other shows. I may return to it at some point."
given,"I give up on most shows because they go on too long, and become repetitive.

Even if they are actually good, like Shameless or The Americans."
given,"House of cards.   I legit loved the first two seasons.  After that,  Meh turned into disgust"
given,"- The Blacklist
- The Flash"
given,"The Wire. I know, its one of the greatest ever. Ive watched Breaking Bad, Sopranos, Better Call Saul multiple times. I even loved the first season. But I simply cannot get through season 2. I think ive been stuck on the first few episodes for three years now.

The Walking Dead is of course an easy answer."
given,If a show has 5+ seasons I'm just totally unable to finish it
given,Deadwood greys shameless arrested development
given,"Sherlock — If you know, you know (and if you don’t know, imagine writing a story and without any build up or foreshadowing, throw dozens of things in the middle with no prior setup, and stumble from there.)

The recent run of Doctor Who, the 13th Doctor, her stories fell flat for me (and the Jack thing.) 

Which is a damn shame because the actress was trying her best with the material she had.

I might return to Doctor Who when the 14th Doctor comes into the picture since RTD was the saving grace for Doctor Who before, however, so half-y on Doctor Who.

But definitely Sherlock."
given,"I recently gave up on Kaleidoscope, I thought it would be a fun show but I found it too dull, I stopped watching after the fourth episode.

I’ve given up on too many shows but these are some of the recent ones I’ve given up on: The Sandman, Blockbuster, Wednesday, The Old Man."
given,"Outlander, Billions, NCIS, Masterchef, Teen Wolf, Shameless, American Horror Story, A Million Little Things, Archer, Twin Peaks/The Return, Orphan Black, The Vampire Dairies/The Originals, House of Cards, Orange is the New Black, Hemlock Grove."
given,"The Walking Dead: think I stopped watching around S7/8/9 or something in that region. Eventually dragged on too long, had too much filler, quality declined, things didn't feel as high stakes etc. to the point where I lost interest.

Westworld: Watched S1 and liked it a lot, watched S2 and liked it somewhat, watched the S3 trailer and felt like it was gonna decline (or at least my level of enjoyment would) and thought ""yeah imma wrap up here"".

Game of Thrones: wasn't for me

House of Cards: wasn't for me."
given,"Most recent is Night Court. I gave it a try because the original is so good but needs a reboot because of how poorly it aged. It's such a great concept for a show, but the new one is just awful. The show works if people are reacting to the ridiculous situations that occur, but the new show is just ridiculous people acting ridiculous. 



Other shows I didn't finish:

Breaking Bad everyone is unlikable and I couldn't get invested in the story. 

Cobra Kai started great when it was mostly focused on Johnny, but when it became a teen melodrama I left. 

The Office is just to cringe inducing."
given,Succession.  Everybody's an asshole.
given,I gave up on Falling Skies and Lost after about 3 seasons each. I just stopped caring.
given,I gave up on GoT after a couple seasons.
given,"Raised by Wolves

I love weird shows, but this one lost me somewhere. Either I didn’t get it or it was deliberately obtuse."
given,"Cobra Kai. It started off as an homage to the movies and the 80s, but lately it's just a bad telenovela."
given,The Last of Us
given,"About to give up on Last of Us.  Episode 2 (outside of the Indonesia part at the beginning) can be summarized as:

*walk...walk...walk some more...walk...walk...walk...again we're walking....*

*hid, fight - BOOM.*

I will watch what I'm told is the greatest piece of television every created - episode 3 before making my final decision."
given,"""The Arc"". At first I was excited because they said it was made by the same people that made Stargate. Then I realized these must be the people that made the horrible Stargate Universe spinoff. Just like Stargate Universe, ""The Ark"" is just a way-over-the-top teenage drama. They just use the SciFi concept as a device to create nonsense drama. They dont obey any of the laws of physics - it's insulting and infuriating."
given,"The Blacklist, Grimm, Fear The Walking Dead,  Falling skies, Riverdale and more..."
given,Sense8. Tried but got too weird too early.
given,"Mayor of Kingstown, Fringe, King of the Hill is the most recent I couldn't finish"
given,"If they had actual finales, go back and finish them unless they actually weren’t liked."
given,"Star Trek, as a franchise"
given,Dexter after the first season
given,"The Flash. I always thought somehow I would make it, because I liked it longer than most, at least in spurts. But when he became father to the elemental forces of the universe, I just couldn't deal with the stupid anymore."
given,"Every show the past 20 years, except Breaking Bad and a few sitcoms. Gonna get back to Better Call Saul sometime."
given,Breaking bad. I got to that fly episode and I just couldn’t do it anymore
given,Man I enjoyed Vikings soo much then each later season that enjoyment dwindled away. Even after Ragnar died there was some cool stuff (He was the heart of the show tho) but damn I had only final season left and just mentally tuned out. Couldn’t focus watching it at all.
given,Walking dead goes through cycles of me giving up then getting back into it
given,"Fear the Walking Dead got much better when they scrapped most of the original crew and brought Morgan into it…but then started going off the rails again. TWD itself was always watchable, but really lost its focus when Carl and Rick both left…it started becoming so repetitive that there were times when I wouldn’t bother to watch unless nothing else was on."
given,"Fear 100000% I sat thru the awful season 4/5…. Seriously go watch it if you want to see the worst writing from tv I swear. So many things are poorly written… and then season 6 was okay, then they killed a main character midway and I gave up, and from the looks of it, killed off another main character…. THEN BROUGHT MADISON BACK AFTER THEY SENT THE OTHER AWAY…. Worst writing. And Vikings seasons 5/6 was a slog. It just turned into brother v brother"
given,"Archer lost me around that time, but I kept watching. The latest season seemed to be a return to something resembling what it used to be. But it feels off, like the show is referring to the earlier Archer without really capturing the same tone and rhythm.

It doesn’t ask much out of me, so I keep watching. But I haven’t really enjoyed much of it since the coma season."
given,"Yes, I watched the first episode of the newer one and it was so strange because they acted like no time passed at all. Kinda wish they left it alone."
given,"Each episode is way too samey, even for a procedural."
given,"I appreciated that the most recent episode was handled somewhat differently than the previous episodes and hopefully that’s a sign that the writers understand that every episode can’t be a murder, but I can definitely understand starting to get a little bored with the show"
given,It’s the overacting that’s doing it for me.
given,Black Sails has an amazing finish.
given,"Grimm, Orphan Black, and Black Sails were excellent shows. Lost as well…but it could be confusing to watch at times."
given,What are you doing?! Black Sails is literally a PERFECT show. And Orphan Black is one of the most underrated shows. Tatiana Maslany is an absolute gem.

Kissing Game,"I don't hate your post.

I just hate you."
Kissing Game,"You, my friend, are quite clearly trolling. Good try but you laid it on a bit thick there at the end."
Kissing Game,I hope you are trolling
Kissing Game,"Nice try, troll.

Get the fuck outta here with this bullshit."
Kissing Game,How much are they paying you for this?
Kissing Game,"I actually read through the post and was getting influenced to restart watching witcher again after leaving it the first time, until you said it's better than arcane, and that's where i stopped reading. Having watched and loved arcane which was brilliant throughout - from first episode till the last, I'm not sure witcher would have that consistency."
Kissing Game,Anyone who likes it did not read the books
Kissing Game,This is bait.
Kissing Game,I watched the first episode last night and it wasn't bad. Haters gonna hate.
Kissing Game,"Didnt watch it. But The Witcher isnt a video game adaption, it was a series of novels first"
Kissing Game,i actually kinda liked it.
Kissing Game,I haven’t (and likely won’t) watch the Witcher. Can I still watch this and understand the plot?
Kissing Game,I’m enjoying it so far. I expect I’ll be downvoted. *shrugs*
Kissing Game,"It’s objectively a bad show. With that said, I got some enjoyment out of it for the fight scenes which were entertaining. Four episodes, so not a large investment. But to say this was better than Arcane, you’re for sure trolling haha"
Kissing Game,Yeah i enjoyed it. I guess cos Ive never read the book and so have no expectation.
Kissing Game,Your standards must be really... really low
Kissing Game,Is this satire??
Kissing Game,Allow me to recommend this review: https://youtu.be/O0qc-lm4VD0 - it perfectly summarizes the show
Kissing Game,">It’s almost as good as Arcane last year. Actually scratch that, I think it’s better than Arcane.

This is how I know OP is not being serious.

So, troll or Netflix shill?

YOU DECIDE"
Kissing Game,Paid shill?  It's a bad as RoP..
Kissing Game,"I enjoyed it, but it wasn't The Witcher."
Kissing Game,Low quality bait
Kissing Game,"thoughts; 

This is the perfect example when a company wants to ""milk"" something.

OG Witcher is one of those series that believes its good but technically its not as well.

Put aside Henry cavil, and what do you have? A shit story with some mediocre CGI."
Kissing Game,"Huge book and games fan here, watched around 3 minutes of it, decided to do a rewatch of Better Call Saul > Breaking Bad instead, only so much time in life."
Kissing Game,"How do you say, you're an advertising bot account for Blood Origin, without saying it......"
Kissing Game,Hi Lauren
Kissing Game,this post almost makes me believe its one of the writers or people that worked on it trying to make it look good lol
Kissing Game,I like your sarcasm too ☺️
Kissing Game,How much are they paying you
Kissing Game,"Seems like a paid comment…

I watched episode 1 last night and it was very uninteresting. The episode was not Paramounts Halo series bad but Blood Origin is not the Witcher."
Kissing Game,Damn they want us to watch it so bad. This is hysterical 😂
Kissing Game,"Honestly its fine. I don't understand the hate, its perfectly in line with the tone and standards of some of the more whimsical Witcher episodes and I'm enjoying the more straightforwardly heroic tone immensely. 

Granted, knowing that the Conjunction of the Spheres turns everything into a massive cluster fuck is a bit of a downer amd adds some hefty dramatic irony to the proceedings, but what can you do."
Kissing Game,Careful your breaking the circlejerk
Kissing Game,"Not to Arcane’s level, but I’m enjoying it more than the Rings of Power. Fight sequences are good, the scenery and cinematography are excellent. I know nothing of the vaunted ‘source material’ so I’m just along for the ride"
Kissing Game,"The arcane level comment makes it hard to take this post seriously but to piggy back on the positivity of the show, I actually liked it. It wasn’t amazing and didn’t blow me away but I liked the world building and I didn’t think the characters were as bad as most others say. I loved seeing how the Witcher world came to be the way it is and the beginnings of hybrids and elixirs. I thought it was a solid addition to the world of the Witcher."
Kissing Game,"There's no way u have the depth to know what good cinema is. Ur missing so much to consider this good. World building? It's impossible to know where anyone is from. There's zero consistency. The fighting? What is this a YouTube short? No, I've seen much better in ytshorts. The plot.... is told to us in 5 min. They don't show, they tell bc the writers couldn't write. I'm not gonna go on, but I feel you might be lacking in some areas. I'm glad you liked it, ur likely their target audience."
Kissing Game,"Can't believe some people really fell for this.
Come on, guys, he said the Resident Evil adaptation was good!"
Kissing Game,Troll post
Kissing Game,Lauren? Is that you?
Kissing Game,Lmao please tell me you’re joking.
Kissing Game,"Awful, awful piece of work."
Kissing Game,Bad troll is bad
Kissing Game,I watched the trailer and decided that it was not for me.
Kissing Game,"“Video game adaptations are in a good place.”  Holy shit, never in my 26 years on this earth have I ever seen a sentence so false. I could give a shit about the Witcher, but this shit has nothing to do with the Witcher besides the title."
Kissing Game,"I loved it but I’m confused about Michelle Yoeh sword…. Seemed to have a good amount of story line, yet nothing."
Kissing Game,Tf you smoking
Kissing Game,Tehee
Kissing Game,meds
Kissing Game,This dudes previous comments are… interesting.. at least I know this person isn’t trolling
Kissing Game,Putting it off? For what a few days? That turd was barely just squeezed out
Kissing Game,"It's better then watching paint dry I guess. Actually, depends on the color of the paint"
Kissing Game,"I enjoyed it a lot, it was good fun."
Kissing Game,TIL the Witcher spin off came out
Kissing Game,"alright everyone took you to task here, but what I'm curious about is you say VGA are in a good place ""now"" and reference Castlevania season two, which is over 4 years old now, but did you hate seasons three and four?"
Kissing Game,"It's not a masterpiece, the Sandman is actually closer to being that than Witcher Blood origin. I didn't mind it tbh, I didn't hate it like most people in this thread, I thought it had a decent cast and action, and for the exception of a very few bad performances here and there (Merwyn namely) it was pretty alright.

But obviously people will not appreciate some changes the showrunners made to the lore, particularily in regards to the lineage of a certain character in the main series."
Kissing Game,"You watched the Dragon Age show?  Was it good?

I love the games, but am nervous to watch the show for some reason."
Kissing Game,"Whether this post is sarcasm or not, I like to think that anyone can like whatever show they want to watch.  Personally I didn't care for the show since I'm  fantasy racist towards elves and the show takes place where they're the main focus.  But my opinions are my own, I just won't watch it while waiting for another series to enjoy."
Kissing Game,"I thought Arcane, Castlevania, and Edgerunners were great. Dragon age was okay. Haven't seen resident evil, but also never played the games. Blood Origin.. was also okay. I don't know, it was the worst Witcher thing I've seen. Had a few good jokes, cool scenery, etc. But the writing/acting/pacing, etc. weren't great. Character development was rushed, motivations didn't make a lot of sense, some were shallow. It kind of just felt like a neat aesthetic applied to some generic fantasy tropes.

I'm kind of thinking you're trolling by putting it above Arcane. Because I'm almost offended by that. Lol. But to each their own I suppose."
Kissing Game,"I agree, i didnt think it deserved the low ratings it got, but it was not better then any of those shows you named. Except dragon age absolution, that show was complete shit."
Kissing Game,i enjoyed it tremendously but i got blasted down saying this in another thread.
Kissing Game,Lol resident evil was good? Dude trolling
Kissing Game,Why are people being so mean? It's just somebody's opinion.
Kissing Game,most \[white\] people shitting on it probably just hate it because they can't stand seeing POC on screen
Kissing Game,"seemed unnecessary and low-budget to me , I've seen it all"
Kissing Game,"A. I'm sorry everyone on Reddit is a huge jerk. 

B. I really liked Arcane so I'm not sure anything could top that. 

C. I'm only through a few episodes of Witcher and it's not super terrible but I did not read the books so..."
Kissing Game,"I thought the show was fine. I really like the Witcher series and I’m sad that Henry Cavill is leaving, he has been perfect for it.  I don’t know much about the Witcher other than the series, never played the games even though I game. I did watch the anime back story one it recommended and that was good. But anyways I thought Blood Origin gave a decent backstory."
Kissing Game,"Naw man, it's genuinely not good."
Kissing Game,I found it it to be pretty forgettable. It was watchable but not good.
Kissing Game,lol a masterpiece of a show?  You can like it all you want but you are going to lose all credibility with that kind of opinion
Kissing Game,"You serious, Clark?"
Kissing Game,"It’s mediocre at best, waste of time at worst"
Kissing Game,You can't be serious.
Kissing Game,https://twitter.com/stephenseanford/status/1607826013773524993?s=46&t=PmawwCpGaPIEHhSEKpjdvw
Kissing Game,LIES!!! This is just a Netflix employee that’s trying to get us to watch it. Don’t give in. Make Netflix understand who the audience is and wants.
Kissing Game,"Until the Resident Evil bit you almost had me. But you have eyes, so this is clearly shit posting."
Kissing Game,Awful
Kissing Game,Bless OP’s heart.
Kissing Game,Show looked like it was made with the budget of a high school play.
Kissing Game,It is shit as is your opinion.
Kissing Game,"Lauren hissrich, is that you?!?!"
Kissing Game,Literally what happened when I read this too lol
Kissing Game,Welcome to Raccoon City seems like a masterpiece compared to whatever that show was.

Cursed,Kids have enjoyed the Sonic movies.
Cursed,"It could be, the game is more linear and cinematic than other adaptations"
Cursed,Once I found out it’s being ran by the guy who made Chernobyl I went all in. Very excited for this show
Cursed,"Netflix has good video game adaptations though. Castlevania, Cyberpunk Edgerunners, Cuphead, Arcane."
Cursed,I really like the first Silent Hill movie.
Cursed,"Lol everyone asking this is acting like LoU isn't already a prestige HBO miniseries in videogame form. This is like the easiest videogame to adapt into a tv series because the game is already a playable goddamn tv series.

It's not like they're trying to live-action adapt... Bayonetta or something."
Cursed,Detective Pikachu and both Sonic movies were pretty good live-action movies.
Cursed,"Are we going to play this game again where we sit here and pretend Street Fighter (1994) isn't a goddamn masterpiece?

Or are we only talking about series?"
Cursed,Sonic 1+2 were an absolute blast so it’s been broken.
Cursed,"I’ve been actively avoiding any trailers or teasers, and I’ve never played the game. So I’m going in cold and hoping for a good show!"
Cursed,There have been a few good video game adaptations lately.
Cursed,Fantastic article by The New Yorker that provides insight into the development of both the game and the upcoming TV show as well as how both mediums can be limited and elevated by porting the experience  from one to the other...aaaand Reddit in the comments only wants respond to the title headline.
Cursed,"Hopefully yes, the guy responsible for Chernobyl is also responsible for this so I'm pretty sure I'll watch it"
Cursed,"I've never been more confident about a game adaptation being good. Chernobyl was one of the best things I've seen in the last 5 years and I trust their showrunner. And we all know the story is great, I'd be very surprised if this turned out to be anything but excellent. I'm pretty envious of my friends that have never played the game and curious to see what they think of the show."
Cursed,I have high hopes. The trailer’s looks awesome. Plus Pedro… what a dream boat…
Cursed,"Yea it can, it has all the elements for greatness, showrunner, cast, HBO.


It's gonna be great."
Cursed,Cyberpunk edge runners and Arcane were both incredible shows
Cursed,This is actually such a good article and interview about the making of the show and the thought behind it but all anyone cares to talk about is the headline.
Cursed,It’s HBO and so we can have more hope than usual
Cursed,"Sonic movies.

I thought detective Pikachu was a very fun movie."
Cursed,So Arcane does not count because its League ?
Cursed,"I really liked the first Resident Evil movies from 20 years ago. Sure, it wasn’t perfect, but it was a fun action movie with some of the lore thrown in. It didn’t do much for the zombie genre in that first film, but I went in with the lowest of expectations."
Cursed,"Here's the problem I have with The Last of Us:

I loved the game. It was great, played through twice. It's praised for its story and rightfully so, it was a gut punch that had me enthralled the whole time with such a killer ending.

So to that point, what's this show gonna give me that the game already hasn't? 

It was amazing and well executed. I'm satisfied with my experience, I loved it. Craig Mazin compared the game to a movie and called it the best video game story of all time ... so it's just a question of why make it?

Is it just for people who haven't played the game? As a Last of Us fan am I not the target demographic? In some instances I understand adapting it, and in some others I'm just like yeah I've seen this already so is the appeal just watching it again?"
Cursed,The fact that its on HBO and not Netflix or Amazon already gives me hope. HBO is just better quality over either of those studios. The games more linear and has a high quality story. Druckmann is working on it as is the guy who made the mini series Chernobyl on HBO. Yea im feeling good for this. And I dont think it will veer to far off from the game like that abomination “Halo” show on Paramount.
Cursed,"The one thing that could save these “bad adaptations” is just to simply stick closer to the source material. 

There is a reason why certain video game stories speak to the fan base, and changing them no longer hits the mark. Simply stick to source material and don’t change the mechanics."
Cursed,"I enjoyed Sonic 2 a lot so it’s been done 

People just like to keep saying this as of arcane isn’t out as well, an adaptation is an adaptation doesn’t matter if it’s animated or not. 

So it’s Been done a few times now"
Cursed,"I think the Tomb Raider movie with Alicia Vikander was very enjoyable.  Not perfect but it was fun.

I also enjoyed Warcraft, although it was just too crammed with lore for someone who hasn't really played the games.  I felt like it actually should've been two movies, but I've watched it a couple of times and liked it."
Cursed,"Between Sonic, Arcane, Edgerunners, Castlevania, DOTA, and even Detective Pikachu, there's already been adaptations that ""break"" the curse. It can be done, it's just very difficult. 

I'm not counting the Witcher, though some might, as I consider that a book adaptation, not a videogame one."
Cursed,Pretty sure Sonic and Detective Pikachu already broke the curse.
Cursed,"Arcane, Castlevania already were fantastic."
Cursed,"I’m not religious, but I’m praying it will"
Cursed,Umm… Arcane.
Cursed,It has all the pieces it needs to be good but at this point I do not want to get my hopes up.
Cursed,"It’s not generally regarded as great cinema, but I think Silent Hill did a phenomenal job of adapting the atmosphere of the games."
Cursed,"It has a lot going for it. As far as plot and setting, it’s pretty grounded so it’s not really that hard to adapt, has the maker of Chernobyl heading it, and it’s HBO.

But I’ll still hold off on my opinion until I see it because video game adaptations do be cursed lol."
Cursed,"From what I’ve learned with Arcane, I think the only real way a video game can be a movie is if the people who made the games story in the first place does it"
Cursed,*coughs in silent hill*
Cursed,"Why did they go and do that?

Why did make the headline in the form of a question??!?

Now the answer is ""no""... Had they left it alone it had a chance.

It's like quantum mechanics.."
Cursed,"I thought the ""curse"" was already broken with Sonic the Hedgehog 1 & 2, Angry Birds 2, The Witcher S1, Arcane, Cuphead, and Werewolves Within?

Update: forgot about Cyberpunk Edgerunners and Detective Pikachu as well! Those were also great!"
Cursed,"Castlevania, Arcane, Cyberpunk, Witcher, and others haven't done it yet?"
Cursed,"The answer is no.

  


That girl they cast as Ellie can't act."
Cursed,"Yea the sonic and pokemon movies were fine, hell il even defend the warcract movie as being okay"
Cursed,"Curse has been broken for a while: Arcane, Castlevania, Edgerunners, Detective Picachu, and The Witcher to name a few."
Cursed,Author of this clearly hasn’t seen Castlevania or Arcane.
Cursed,It’s not a curse so much as it’s the ego of showrunners and directors that think they’re better than the source material they adapt when no one care who they are and their original ideas they confidently crowbar into the story are insipid trash.
Cursed,"I’m confused, why are people forgetting about arcane? lol

The curse is already broken."
Cursed,Arcane was good
Cursed,Arcane was fucking beautiful
Cursed,The casting is wrong from the get go
Cursed,"i mean, have you heard of Arcane?"
Cursed,Arcane would like to have a word
Cursed,Arcane and Sonic have been pretty good at breaking the curse
Cursed,"No, because it’s already way off with casting."
Cursed,"Probably not, it was an awful “game”. It was more like an interactive movie"
Cursed,"That “curse” was broken a long time ago, Castlevania, Cuphead, Cyberpunk Edgerunners, Arcane, Sonic 1 & 2 and Detective Pikachu are all great."
Cursed,Sonic movie already did.
Cursed,Arcane was pretty great I feel.
Cursed,"Not live action, but they did a great job on Arcane and Edgerunners. Live action wise, not getting my hopes up at all."
Cursed,Arcane: am I a joke to you??
Cursed,"""Arcane"" already did you philistines."
Cursed,I am sorry but what about Arcane?! Is like one of the best shows??
Cursed,Arcane already shattered that curse
Cursed,"This is a really dumb title. We KNOW there are so many good ones out already, many listed here."
Cursed,no because Arcane did!
Cursed,Arcane has entered the chat.
Cursed,"Rhe curse has been long broken though. Castlevania, Cyberpunk Edgerunners, Detective Pikachu, Arcane and Sonic have been decent to great adaptations. What remains to be seens is live action TV series but we've been getting a decent stream of great adaptations as of late."
Cursed,Have they not seen Arcane?
Cursed,My guess is no
Cursed,The author obviously hasn't seen some of the more recent video game derived shows.
Cursed,"Mortal Kombat had 2 great movies.

Sonic one was pretty damn good

Witcher is a great show. My wife hates video games and loves the Witcher.

League of Legends Arcane

Pokemon has lasted 25 years based on a game

This article is dumb"
Cursed,"Uhhh sonic? Arcane? Edgerunners? Likey the mario movie? Need i go on, that streak was broken a long time ago"
Cursed,Arcane?
Cursed,Did you somehow forget about Arcane?
Cursed,I'm sorry. Didn't Arcane already break this curse?
Cursed,So we are just going to ignore Arcane?
Cursed,"Kind of weird article since Sonic, Cyberpunk, Arcane and Uncharted ( yes if it does that well you could consider it a break) all “broke the curse”.

Articles like this always seem weirdly out of touch."
Cursed,Arcane and Castlevania: Am I a joke to you?
Cursed,Cyberpunk edgerunners would like a word
Cursed,"Sonic movies, Arcane, Cyberpunk Edgerunners"
Cursed,That “curse” has already been broken as of late: Sonic & Detective Pikachu have been really good compared to the others.
Cursed,Wtf does this mean? Detective pikachu and sonic were good. Or does it matter only mean adaptations of bad video games?
Cursed,I hope so…high hopes for this one…
Cursed,This sub sucks.
Cursed,You mean like Arcane already did?
Cursed,"its HBO, bet this will be the best of bunch live action game adaptation that we got and we will get. from recently Halo-Resident evil. and soon, fallout- god of war-horizon-warhammer, and many other."
Cursed,I love the Street Fighter movie. (Covers left eye) but I guess you didn’t see that!
Cursed,Everyone in this thread talking about the 3 good animated things that came out in the last few years and ignoring 20 years of live action bombs
Cursed,"It's not a curse. It's because video game IP has never been treated seriously and is turned into genetic action flicks like Resident Evil or Assassin's Creed. They don't hire screenwriters or directors who are excited about the world, characters, lore, or themes. That is not the case with The Last of Us. It wasn't the case with Arcane either. Hire talent, not hacks. How the fuck are execs still scratching their heads over this?"
Cursed,"What I don’t understand about this show is that I really loved the game’s story, and thought it was a great medium for it cause while the story happens you also spend a ton of time in the environments soaking it in seeing how the world is which colors the dialogue in and out of cutscenes. So why would a show bring anything to it? Either it is the same story which I can’t imagine being better than just playing The Last of Us, or its a new take on it, which I have no need for cause I like the source material as is and it’s not like a big expansive universe you can draw from. Idk seems so weird"
Cursed,"Stupid. Not a real curse. Many examples otherwise (Sonic, Cyberpunk Edgerunners, Arcane, Silent Hill, first Resident Evil movie, Super Mario Bros movie)"
Cursed,"The Witcher has been quite good regardless of what the diehards say (though it was a book series first so perhaps that DQs it). 

Arcane is one of the best shows of the last 18 months. Period. Video game adaptation or otherwise it’s truly an amazing bit of content. 

I’ve heard that the Castlevenia show was quite good. Cuperpunk Edgerunners has received positive critical attention. 

It’s not as though no “story based on a game” has done well."
Cursed,Have people forgotten about Resident Evil?
Cursed,"I love how many people are denying there’s an adaptation curse by bringing up a handful of niche Netflix cartoons and children’s movies while conveniently ignoring Halo, Netflix’s Resident Evil, Uncharted, Assassin’s Creed, Prince of Persia, Warcraft, and dozens of other disastrous adaptations."
Cursed,You're gonna disrespect Mortal Kombat like that?
Cursed,The cast is already concerning.
Cursed,No
Cursed,Resident Evil movie was a good watch.
Cursed,Arcane and other shows have already broken this curse but most people don’t consider animation to be “adult” enough
Cursed,What a dated article.
Indian Matchmaking,Love is Blind Japan was the best and so different from the US version.  It's cool to see how different cultures approach the 'experiment.'
Indian Matchmaking,"Love is Blind is my wife and I's favourite guilty pleasure trash TV. It's an absolute trainwreck of cringe and we binged each season as it came out in a couple of days. 

Also obligatory - fuck Shake."
Indian Matchmaking,Love on the Spectrum is a sweet little show. Not sad to see more of it.
Indian Matchmaking,"I've been meaning to watch the latest season. I don't usually watch stuff like that, but someone I graduated high school with, Deepti, is in the latest season. So it just automatically makes me curious. And I did enjoy the couple seasons of terrace house i wound up watching."
Indian Matchmaking,Glad I cancelled
Indian Matchmaking,They renew the Brazilian version too...
Indian Matchmaking,I wish they would bring back Dating Around. S1 was popular but it seems to have gotten lost in the sea of/upstaged by other dating reality tv.
Indian Matchmaking,How was it different from the US version? My gf watched the US version and I didn't like the way the show was set up and the overall feel of the show
Indian Matchmaking,You're glad you canceled because.... more shows got renewed/picked up?
Indian Matchmaking,"The setup is the same but culturally it’s completely different.  It’s super interesting to see the difference in respect and comradeship vs the Americans which just come off as cheap, drama seeking narcissists."
Indian Matchmaking,Not exactly prestige tv I was looking for when I originally subscribed
Indian Matchmaking,"It’s trashy “reality” TV. 

Two or three months a year is more than enough time to watch the two to three quality shows. 

It also doesn’t help that they’re only releasing them every other year."
Indian Matchmaking,"Also, US dating shows tend to be quite sexual. There was hardly any sexual content on the Japanese version. Agree that it felt more respectful"
Indian Matchmaking,"I mean they have a whooooooooole lot of other shows, but hey if you didn't enjoy Netflix when you had it who am I to judge."
Indian Matchmaking,"> Two or three months a year is more than enough time to watch the two to three quality shows.

I disagree, but whatever, it's your experience I guess. 

> It also doesn’t help that they’re only releasing them every other year.

What!? You think Netflix only release quality shows ever other year?"
Indian Matchmaking,It seems to be the case with all their “big budget” quality shows. They didn’t do it before and they didn’t start doing this because of covid.…yet they keep increasing the Price.
Indian Matchmaking,"They are releasing quality shows every week in some cases- we just had Last Kingdom, Top Boy, Vikings, Juvenile Justice, Drive to Survive etc and coming up soon we’ll have Bridgerton, Russian Doll, Grace and Frankie and Ozark. 

The distain for Netflix in this sub for easy upvotes is absolutely comical."
Indian Matchmaking,The one thing this show definitely showed/s is the caste system is very much alive even in the US.
Indian Matchmaking,"🤢🤢🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮 

Edit: 🤢🤢🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮 

Edit 2: 🤢🤢🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮"
Indian Matchmaking,"I almost lost it when Ankita, the photographer/business owner girl showed up and Sima said ""she's not very photogenic"" like whaaaaaaat ? Because she's not light skin ? Because she's curvy ? Girl was freaking pretty.

She didn't say that with the other girls and it really bothered me. 

And when Geeta, the other apparently ""modern"" matchmaker said things like she should make more compromises and stuff, it felt like she just wanted Ankita to tone the ""independent woman"" down. 

Ankita, you go girl !"
Indian Matchmaking,"I'm glad this atrocity of a show is finally getting some public attention. India (and many other South East Asian countries) are in a weird flux where western modern concepts are clashing head on with the older traditions. This, in my view, has made things even more hectic and stressful for young Indians in a 'marriageable age'.

Case in point my friend was engaged to a guy. It was an arranged marriage between 2 upper class business families. However, the Groom's family found pictures of my friend in a bikini on some old facebook album and freaked the fuck out and cancelled the engagement cause their future bahu (daughter in law) cannot be allowed to be anything less than a symbol of feminine purity.

You think Tinder & other dating apps are depressing? Try using an Indian Matchmaking App. The amount of different fields you have to fill up ranging from education to current salary to your caste would anyone lose faith in the concept of marriage itself"
Indian Matchmaking,"Given the outcome of all the couples, I would say that the matchmaker is batting 0%."
Indian Matchmaking,"I honestly thought that the show was shedding a light on how people are, especially in a casteist society. The problem is that they didn't expand further on it."
Indian Matchmaking,"Honestly, INDIA should start focusing on making documentaries a lot. That would be something"
Indian Matchmaking,"I cant express how much I hated every reference to 'biodata'.
Whenever that phrase was mentioned my brother would laugh at my subsequant rant."
Indian Matchmaking,"While the show was enjoyable I can easily tell how casteist people are talking about being “fair” or “fair skinned”. The face reader/astrologer annoyed me just on my skeptical reasons but it is whatever. 

Arranged marriages are horrible for the simple fact that “they give freedom of choice” that is an illusion because the parents are the ultimate deciders it seems. The children get no true say in the matter. Obviously it is a culture clash from me (atheist, white American) that they treat marriage as more of a political merging of families to keep the family welfare to continue and the love of the participants is a plus. 

And then you have this system that keeps castes in place and perpetuates them.
Theoretically the matchmaker is an in person Eharmony, but within the Indian/Hindu cultural is has negative undertones.

Article also brings up the misogynistic aspects of it as well.

Also, my hero of the show is the woman who runs the photography business who says fuck this system I’m staying single."
Indian Matchmaking,"I found a really hilarious review of the show on YouTube that takes a sarcastic approach. Had a blast watching xD.
Leaving the link if you might be interested to watch. NO SPOILERS.
[Indian Matchmaking Review](https://youtu.be/kM73REHLy04)"
Indian Matchmaking,Is there such a thing as bad publicity?
Indian Matchmaking,"There is definitely a lot of sexism/bigotry/ignorance in the Indian community.

I don't see what is wrong though in wanted someone that is light skinned to marry. There is nothing wrong with having preferences for people's looks...."
Indian Matchmaking,What the fuck does colorism mean
Indian Matchmaking,"The irony is that the vast majority of people LIKE the show and would want their kids to go on it. However, their is a vocal minority complaining about the show on the blogosphere (with good points) that is getting the attention. Reality is most people love the show but a few didn't like it."
Indian Matchmaking,"You know that’s not the show’s fault, right? It didn’t create the caste system in India or the the line of bigoted useless aunty/uncles in the show. It’s a documentary series, and (other than some obvious reality tv editing manipulation) it basically shows it as it is. India is a hierarchical society and Indians can’t meet one new person without measuring them against their caste, class and creed."
Indian Matchmaking,"Yeah, this show is just holding up a mirror to things that are commonplace in the Indian community. 

It left interpretation of it kind of open to the audience, I think because they may have been concerned about how comfortable non Indian western audiences would be watching a straight forward condemnation of another culture."
Indian Matchmaking,India should make documentaries about arranged marriage/dating and then the subsequent weddings. Indian Weddings are easily the most entertaining/luxurious/colorful in the world. It would make SO much money.
Indian Matchmaking,Me too. Like they are they sending over blood samples or wtf
Indian Matchmaking,"At first, I thought that biodata was samples or tests, it took me a while to realize they were talking about the resumes"
Indian Matchmaking,"> Arranged marriages are horrible for the simple fact that “they give freedom of choice” that is an illusion because the parents are the ultimate deciders it seems. The children get no true say in the matter. 

In older times, this was true in most cases. In modern times, this is still true in some cases but not true in most. Arranged marriages today tend to happen because the boy or girl hasn't found a life partner after years of freely dating in their 20s/early 30s, and want some help from their family or from a matchmaker with finding someone to settle down with. 

My parents had an arranged marriage; they were introduced to each other in their late 20s by their families and were never forced into anything. This was after both of them turned down many potential matches. My mom didn't want to date anyone, and my dad was tired of dating people. They found that they liked each other and had a lot in common. So they agreed to get married, and both families were on board with it. They've since been happily married for the past 32 years. 

All the caste stuff and colorism stuff though I agree with you on, it's really antiquated and I was quite annoyed to see that it's still prevalent with some of the families we saw on the show. Just know that things today aren't really like that for a very large chunk of the Indian population. 

Majority of the children today ultimately have the final say in their marriages, and we saw this to be true in the show because most of the people portrayed were turning down matches that were shown to them or that they went on a date with. It's especially true of the Indian Americans that were on the show (Aparna and Nadia) who from what I understand are currently still single today."
Indian Matchmaking,"Someone else addressed your point about the freedom of choice. I just wanted to tell you that skin color has very less to do with casteism. They are separate problems. I belong to an ""upper caste"" family and my skin color is much darker, for which I face a lot of discrimination. I have many friends from ""lower caste"" families who are much more fair than me. I also just want to say that the newer generations, or at least quite a large chunk of them, definitely do not give a fuck about caste anymore, and slowly but surely the mindset here is changing."
Indian Matchmaking,"If you are familiar with arranged marriages at all, you would see that children 100% have a say in who they get to marry. I'm not sure where you are hearing otherwise.

Also, there is nothing wrong with wanting your marriage partner to be fair skinned. It's the same as wanting someone who isn't short or has blue eyes or black hair. Nothing wrong with having physical preferences for your partner.


Of course, discriminating outside of that is wrong of course."
Indian Matchmaking,">I don't see what is wrong though in wanted someone that is light skinned to marry. There is nothing wrong with having preferences for people's looks....

They do completely take it for granted in the show, though. When Sima is listing off what makes someone's biodata promising, she'll say something like ""she's well-off, quite pretty, very fair..."" It's less of a personal preference than it is considered a standard way to judge prospects in the show"
Indian Matchmaking,"The problem is that it isn't a simple individual preference. It's a whole societal attitude which sends a message that you need to have a fair skin in order to succeed. Case in point is their whole skin lightening branch of cosmetic industry, that even some Western companies engage in because it's profitable."
Indian Matchmaking,There is definitely a lot of sexism/bigotry/ignorance in your comment.  Holy shit!
Indian Matchmaking,"Well, you sound aggressive and I'm guessing you won't care about the answer, but colorist refers to preference given to light-skinned person of the same ethnic or cultural background as darker-skinned people. 

Now I'll wait for you to predictably say ""people's preferences are natural and they aren't racist!"" and then wave your hands around, to which I will reply ""it's still a thing that negatively affects darker skinned people, and it's a phenomenon that bears discussion."""
Indian Matchmaking,"I don't think the show is honestly trying to critique anything. What they show is honestly just an accurate reflection of the matchmaking process in India, they're just showing it for what it is."
Indian Matchmaking,INDIA is full of rich materials for Documentaries. Not limited to Marriage but I get what you mean.
Indian Matchmaking,"When Hari got Married, What's love got to do with it and A Suitable Girl are all great documentaries if yiu want to check out."
Indian Matchmaking,The producer of this show already made an arranged marriage documentary a couple years ago.
Indian Matchmaking,Thanks for the info!
Indian Matchmaking,"That seems like an excuse to me concerning the children having the choice. Yes, they can say yes or no. But isn’t that completely dependent on the parents/family saying yes first?

I’m sorry, I don’t think these physical preferences are because the person finds only light skinned people attractive. Maybe they do find them attractive but that is completely hiding the caste system behind that. No one rules someone out because they have brown eyes and not blue.

I think it is dishonest to not mention that this is a systemic occurrence on finding light skinned people more attractive and also light skinned people are “higher up” in the caste system."
Indian Matchmaking,[removed]
Indian Matchmaking,"Again, having physical sexual preferences in someone is totally fine imo. Liking fair skin is the same as liking blue eyes or someone tall. 

Now, of course discriminating and treating people poorly because they are dark is wrong. But wanting a fair skinned marriage partner is totally fine imo."
Indian Matchmaking,"It is a simple individual preference in many situations though. You can't just claim ""they only light skinned because of societal pressure"". Some people prefer light skin in the same way some people prefer taller people. Ain't nothing wrong with it. What you are saying is that everyone who prefers light skin in a partner is just following for society's racist narrative and they are subconsciously racist."
Indian Matchmaking,"Exactly this. I think if anything the show is just trying to raise cultural awareness. By the end of the last episode, they show us a good handful of clips of couples, both young and old, who are in arranged marriages and how happy they are together. 

The show to me is just showing that matchmaking in Indian culture isn't as medieval of a concept as the Western world makes it out to be. It's just a potential solution for people in their late 20s and 30s who are having trouble finding a life partner. My parents had an arranged marriage and have been happily married for 32 years. It's nothing they were forced into. They just met through their parent's introducing them, found that they had many things in common, and agreed to get married.

I also do want to say that as a Trinidadian Indian, I really appreciate that they had some Indo-Caribbean representation on the show with the Guyanese girl. 

Much of the Indian community look down on us as not being Indian despite the fact that in some ways we're honestly more cultured than many Indian people are. I appreciate the show for raising awareness about something that many East Indian people are either blind to or aren't aware about.

I have my issues with the show (mainly to do with things like colorism that the show doesn't address, and also I have connections with Aparna IRL through mutual friends, and there was a lot of manipulative editing and stuff behind the scenes that was done to portray some of the people in a bad light) but as a whole, I think the show isn't all that bad."
Indian Matchmaking,"ooooh yeah 100% agree. I don't remember where I heard it, but India is the most traveled to /documented country for travel shows. Especially food ones."
Indian Matchmaking,"If you notice on the show, most people are in their late 20s/early 30s and have already been dating/trying to find a mate. Indian parents are definitely judgmental but the prevailing sentiment in India is if you can find someone organically to marry (a love marriage), go for it ! Of course parents will provide backlash, but this is the prevailing sentiment.



Most of the people on the show have tried organic dating but it didn't work out so they want a match maker to help them. Of course the parents play a part in that, but the child still ultimately gets the choice. They can say yes or no, even if the parents don't like them."
Indian Matchmaking,"They do the same thing for tall women. There were height, skin color, and career requirements for both genders."
Indian Matchmaking,"See it is not just a ""preference"" in India. A lot of people here will call out darker-skinned women and call them names. They will tell them to get fairer, because otherwise how would they ever get a husband. There are tons of people who will see you as straight up ugly.

The difference here is that while you might be more accepting of other polygenic traits, people who are of a darker colour are rejected by almost everyone in their life when it comes to beauty. It goes from a preference, which is something you like, to discrimination, something you actively look down on.

I don't know how much sense I made but I hope I was able to tell you why it is different."
Indian Matchmaking,Height isn't how we group people into races and then discriminate against them though.
Indian Matchmaking,"Where do you think discriminating against dark skinned Indian people comes from.... excusing fair skin as simply a “preference” directly correlates to how those people are seen, valued, and treated and is reflective of a larger attitude held in that society. 

Like dude.... you can’t be that dumb"
Indian Matchmaking,"You must appreciate though that people don't live in a vacuum and the ""personal preferences"" that most people have, with regards to what features they find attract, are heavily influenced by the values of the culture and history of the society they live in. Finding lighter-skinned people, particularly women, more attractive is absolutely part of a larger culture of beauty standards in India (and many other places) and while someone can certainly feel that this is their own preference, it's important to understand the influences that affect our preferences. It's not as though this is a problem unique to India but a show can depict norms and also acknowledge that they can, and have been, harmful or limiting to this day."
Indian Matchmaking,It's not an individual preference.  It's a subconscious result of living under systemic racism.  Same reason a white woman crosses the street if a black man is approaching.  That's the effect of racism acting on an individual coloring (no pun intended) their view of the world.
Indian Matchmaking,Wait how are you more “cultured” than “many” Indians? If you were you wouldn’t say something like that.
Indian Matchmaking,"""Much of the Indian community look down on us""

What experience s led you to that conclusion.

BTW ""many"" in India is really many. So be careful with that broad brush."
Indian Matchmaking,"Anthony Bourdain said India is the only place where he'd be ok eating vegetarian all the time. If that isn't a glowing endorsement, I don't know what is."
Indian Matchmaking,"“the child still ultimately gets the choice. They can say yes or no, even if the parents don't like them.”

So that makes a difference (concerning my personal problem with arranged marriages). If the child has complete control, and can say yes when the parent says no that is great."
Indian Matchmaking,As long as your love match is also Indian.
Indian Matchmaking,"discrimination of dark skinned people dates back to the Aryan invasions in India and developing the caste system.

That doesn't change the fact that individually people are perfectly fine to have standards and prefer certain skin tones over others. How people are treated should never be based on skin tone. However, you can't tell someone who prefers light skinned people sexually that they are racist for believing so. Or if someone prefers dark skin to light skin in terms of attractiveness. Or liking brown hair vs blonde etc."
Indian Matchmaking,"Of course people understand that it's a societal thing, it doesn't mean they are wrong however for having preference. I'm well aware that society pushes light skinned beauty standards. I still however prefer light skinned people attractiveness wise, and there is nothing wrong with that."
Indian Matchmaking,"When it comes to Hindu culture, West Indians seem to be more upholding. They'll usually be at their mandir for 24 hours of Shivraatri every year, both Navratris, Ganesh Chathurti, Ram Navami, Krishna Janamashtami, Hanuman Jayanti, etc. where as most East Indians don't observe all of these at all. That's in addition to going to every Sunday morning for 4-5 hours. They also wear Indian clothing when going and will sit for puja, havan, and a 1-2 hour discourse by the Hindu priest. 

Whereas from what I've seen of the East Indian community, most families show up to a temple in normal Western clothing, take about five minutes or so to do basic worship to the murtis, take their prasadam and then immediately leave. 

Many of the younger generation including myself included are also classically trained in singing and playing Indian instruments, and are adept at singing bhajans, ghazals, etc. while playing a harmonium and tabla. Because of this, music is also a huge part of worship at West Indian mandirs. I usually spend every Sunday morning at my temple playing meditative violin during worship. Here in Orlando, the most prominent Indian musicians are literally all West Indian, and are even getting hired now by the East Indian community when they're in need of light music at their weddings and other Indian events. 

This is all in contrast to what I've observed from all of my friends, who are American Indians from traditional Indian families. For the most part, they are living much more American lifestyles and have all but given up observation of Hindu culture outside of Diwali and maybe Navratri every year."
Indian Matchmaking,There is a reason the British literally were traveling across the world to India.....their SPICES
Indian Matchmaking,"yea they can always say no.

It's just a grey area because Indian culture is different. They are far more family oriented, so the family's getting along is a LOT more stressed than in western cultures. The kids as a result value and ask for a lot of input from their parents because they need to make sure their own family approves. Some kids go overboard however and just put all the decision making in their parents hand (which is foolish and wrong). But 99% of the time the kid has the autonomy to say no."
Indian Matchmaking,"My parents got married even though their parents said no, this was more than 20 years go. So children definitely have a say"
Indian Matchmaking,"You can when the “preference” is stated or viewed in any way as a requirement, as it was in this show. 

If you’re not open to meeting anyone dark-skinned or blonde-haired and don’t believe their other factors can compensate for missing that preference, it’s because you’re racist. It quite literally means you think skin color is more important than every other facet of a human being.

In Indian communities this “preference” that’s actually a requirement is due to living under a culture of widespread systemic discrimination."
Indian Matchmaking,"How far up your ass are you? Imagine believing going to temples on Sunday somehow makes you ""more cultured""?"
Indian Matchmaking,"You’re a traditionalist, you’re not “more cultured”. You’re also quite judgmental it seems by generalizing Indian Americans. Also, many Indians have diverse religious backgrounds."
Indian Matchmaking,"I understand that child can say no. But my question (which you seemed to have addressed) is can the child say yes (and get married) while the family says no. 
Do the parents act as someone else helping the child with someone to marry or are they gatekeepers? The gatekeeper meaning that only candidates who the parents say yes to “make it through” for the child then to say yes or no to."
Indian Matchmaking,That wasn't the only point I raised. But okay buddy lol
Indian Matchmaking,"It's case by case tbh. For example, I know kids who have super rich parents, and thus their parents are the gatekeepers of money. Many of these rich kids let the parents be gatekeepers due to $$$. Some just say fuck it and tell their parents to fuck off."
Indian Matchmaking,"Dev1359 don’t worry about these idiots. Ppl here will intentionally, flat out miss your point or try to critique 3 words you said to feel smart or be an asshole."
Indian Matchmaking,"👍, gotcha"
Indian Matchmaking,"When The Circle first popped up I was hoping they went more down the angle of competitive reality shows like Big Brother/Survivor/The Challenge and things of that nature but everything they've premiered since has sort of gone in the exact opposite direction.

Go buy the rights to The Genius or some of the South Korean reality shows!"
Indian Matchmaking,"This was the most binge-able show I've seen in a long time. SO and I demolished it in two evenings.

I've seen it called a reality show a few times, but I think it's firmly in docuseries territory. I hope they will do more seasons."
Indian Matchmaking,"Interesting read, makes me wanna watch the show"
Indian Matchmaking,"wow, really took a sarcastic approach to review the show in a clever and hilarious way. Had a blast watching. Check it out if interested... No spoilers :
[Indian Matchmaking Review](https://youtu.be/kM73REHLy04)"
Indian Matchmaking,This show was great. Binged it all.
Indian Matchmaking,"""Powerful, successful Indian-American feminists are rightfully enraged at having the strong Indian-American woman represented by the rude and tempestuous Aparna.""

Wtf? Who says that every Indian they have on has to represent the best versions of a specific demographic? Anyone with half a brain would realise not all independent Indian-American women are like Aparna. Just look at Nadia!

Edit: I meant Nadia was a good example of a strong independent woman"
Indian Matchmaking,"Aparna was such an extreme. Self-obsessed, lacking self awareness, difficult, rude and condescending. She is the reason she is single. Being an independent and modern woman doesn’t mean you’re an asshole."
Indian Matchmaking,"Vikings and Ozark are not on the list because you did not enjoyed or because you never watched?

I love Game of Thrones,The Last Kingdom,The Handmaid's Tale and Westworld from your list.
Unpopular but i also enjoyed Cursed,It was fun to watch.
Season 4 of The Walking Dead was one of the best seasons in my opinion,If you disliked that season you would have hated some seasons in the future."
Indian Matchmaking,Big Mouth is 10? That's seriously the worst show I've ever seen.  I always wondered who exactly watched that.
Indian Matchmaking,Bob is awesome! Love that show!
Indian Matchmaking,How is Ted lasso not a 10
Indian Matchmaking,Breaking Bad but no Better Call Saul?
Indian Matchmaking,Ewww Chrishell and Christine are both bad. Mary all the way.
Indian Matchmaking,"Half of Game of Thrones (seasons 1-4) is a 10/10 show and the other half of it (seasons 5-8) is a 2/10 show.

So averaging them together, the show gets a 6/10."
Indian Matchmaking,"If you subtracted 5 from each rating and went an ""* out of 5"" rating system instead, it still would be about the same."
Indian Matchmaking,"Vikings and Ozark are on my list to watch! As for TWD I think I may have stopped after 3rd season? I don't remember as it was a while back but will definitely have to resume. I forgot to add to this list but the new show Invincible is really, really good and is made from the same people as TWD, highly recommend."
Indian Matchmaking,exceptional in its 1st season and hits different but 10/10 is hard to hit for me and should be reserved for the absolute best that couldn't have been better
Indian Matchmaking,😑
Indian Matchmaking,Simply haven't seen but I hear it's as good as if not better than BB
Indian Matchmaking,Mary is indeed the most mature and apparently carries the load in terms of earnings for the O group. the favoritism seems to only be for drama as she has actually earned her place at the top.
Buy It Now,I like Tubi.  Had no idea FOX owned it.
Buy It Now,"""Tubi, or Not To Be""."
Buy It Now,Tubi is fantastic. Lots of great movies from before the 90s on there.
Buy It Now,Did they air a commercial during the Superbowl last night? I only caught the very end where they showed the logo. It surprised me bc that's a pretty big platform for a second-tier (third-tier?) streaming site to be advertising on unless they're trying to make some major moves.
Buy It Now,"I love Tubi. it packs a ton of movies on the system. Yes tons of garbage content. but i don't feel bad about cutting something off 10 mins in and switching to something else.

Meanwhile there's always that great feeling when you stumble upon something that is good or even ""aight""

i also take comfort in that if i had to slim down my budget i could cut streaming services and still have stuff i can throw on TV for movie night."
Buy It Now,I quite like Tubi. It has some utter crap on it but in Canada it has things like Ultraman and Kamen Rider and some decent movies. I also noticed it’s in the process of adding Live Channels as well. Very similar to Plutotv just a better on demand library
Buy It Now,"Pluto isn't bad either. 

I'll throw on Star Trek channel, Stargate channel, or Rifftrax/MST3K channel for mindless background TV when I can't pay full attention and don't want to have to keep picking shows, like doing chores or work.  Movie selection is decent too.

There are ads but they aren't too bad, though I think Tubi has slightly fewer. The types of ads can be oddly specific. I never knew Lupus patients were a target demo for Deep Space Nine."
Buy It Now,"I call bs, they won't say who wanted to buy. Sounds like a nice story to advertise the service"
Buy It Now,"I watch Tubi from time to time. While their content library is full of trashy B-movies for the most part, they do have some good, old & new, movies as well."
Buy It Now,"Tubi's good. It just has tons of content that isn't elsewhere. 

I found it when i was looking for Xena/Hercules episodes. Unfortunately those aren't on there anymore"
Buy It Now,"Tubi has a few older shows that aren’t available on other platforms or even digitally purchasable on iTunes/Google, etc that I enjoy watching once in a while."
Buy It Now,whenever I open up tubi I see lots of older stuff that I would kind of like to watch but I just don't have the time to do it
Buy It Now,Tubi has a great selection of older/80s horror movies.
Buy It Now,"TIL Fox owns Tubi.

Today I decided not to watch Tubi as long as Fox owns it."
Buy It Now,My only context I have for Tubi is the terribly edited Tubi parodies people post on other websites.
Buy It Now,I seriously never heard of Tubi.
Buy It Now,Such a lie…
Buy It Now,So does Disney technically also own Tubi or is fox still an independent company. I thought all of 20th century Fox assets now belong to Disney.
Buy It Now,"Tubi's not bad. Mostly just throw it on in the background, recently catching up on old favorite MST3K and Rifftrax episodes."
Buy It Now,"I am bewildered as to what was on the table. Is it just the infrastructure of the service or the content?

Edit:  The more I think about it, it has to be the content. That is just baffling. Do they really think old all the reality show trash that fox has will really carry a streaming platform?"
Buy It Now,"I didn’t even know Tubi existed, let alone being worth $2 billion."
Buy It Now,"I wasn't familiar with Tubi until my mom cut the cord and had to acquaint with streaming on her smart TV.  She loves it, it's not really big on new, original content but there's so many old movies and TV shows, it's perfect for older people."
Buy It Now,"They didn't build it, they bought it. Murdoch also loves making money, so if something is profitable enough he doesn't necessarily try to run it like his propaganda operations. See the Simpsons. But in the end he either wants it to bring him money or political influence or both."
Buy It Now,Fox as in newscorp or fox as in disney ?
Buy It Now,"That’s a funny way of spelling Disney.

Edit: oops apparently it’s actually the conservative rag version of Fox."
Buy It Now,"i assumed it did only because they get the newest episodes of whatever the current Gordon Ramsay cooking show is, pretty quickly"
Buy It Now,Same. I was sketched at first but they have great content for free
Buy It Now,I read this with Tommy Wiseaus voice in my head.
Buy It Now,"More like *Tubi, is not to be*.

The [Tubi Interface Interruption](https://www.msn.com/en-us/sports/nfl/tubi-super-bowl-commercial-was-absolutely-diabolical/ar-AA17qPH8) ad was actually quite distressing to my gf because it looked like someone was controlling the tv while I was not in the room.

Then this morning I saw [what FOX traded to get Tubi](https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/01/25/did-fox-make-a-mistake-buying-tubi/) and I felt better. If someone offers them $2 billion they should take it. Then they'd only be down $500 million."
Buy It Now,"And classic shows like MXC, Brisco County Jr, etc"
Buy It Now,"The super bowl was on Fox, who owns Tubi"
Buy It Now,"The ad was pretty clever actually. Made it seem like someone cut away from the game returning and put in Mr and Mrs Smith on Tubi. 

It was obviously an ad to me but I could imagine falling for it if I was at a bar and I’m sure there were a lot of people freaking out at parties thinking someone changed the game"
Buy It Now,"Yep, [two](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73p4lL1iq7w) in [fact](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GtyxWvifru8)"
Buy It Now,Yes. They’re owed by Fox. There were a ton of ads for Fox’s ~~propaganda~~ media network.
Buy It Now,To be arguably had the most famous commercial of the night. It'll definitely be the commercial remembered from this super bowl.
Buy It Now,I actually believe it but I bet it’s from like late 2021 when media stocks were flying through the roof. They’ve all been slashed by 50%+ and I doubt any offers are rolling in anymore.
Buy It Now,"It's the place to go if you want to relive the glory days of Skinemax, without all the pesky nudity."
Buy It Now,Its great for Horror movies. Second best streaming service for horror besides Shudder
Buy It Now,Best msk3k and rifftrax libraries
Buy It Now,They usually have a decent selection of absolute classics mixed in with everything else.
Buy It Now,Their horror catalogue is by far superior to any other streaming service.  They also have a large collection of Chuck Norris films.
Buy It Now,"I use it more for TV shows that I want to revisit. I don't watch so many movies, it always feels weird to watch them with ads since they're not meant to have them, while shows are produced with ad breaks in mind."
Buy It Now,Explains why they had so many ads during the game. At least they only aired one Fox Nation ad.
Buy It Now,"There's a few rival services. I mainly watch pluto, same type of linear tv streaming but primarily the paramount library...I stick to the star trek and comedy central channels, but they got tons of other shit."
Buy It Now,It's a free streaming service but with ads. It's pretty good if you don't want to pay for streaming services or don't mind the ads. The content isn't overwhelming though
Buy It Now,"It has Gordon Ramsay’s full catalogue including all his UK shows, before he moved them to the US and they became overdramatic reality TV."
Buy It Now,"It's a lifesaver if you travel a lot/ stay in a lot of AirBnBs and don't feel like signing in on a host's device. 

I rarely use it at home though as it typically has the same options as a lot of other streaming services, esp movies. Otherwise it's not bad."
Buy It Now,It's just another bottom feeder FAST (Free Ad-supported Streaming Television) service like Pluto TV.
Buy It Now,"This is Fox Corp, which is the part Disney doesn't own."
Buy It Now,"Anything called ""Fox"" now is not owned by Disney, they renamed its division they bought into ""20 Century"""
Buy It Now,"Not all of Fox was sold to Disney. Just most of it. Murdoch (Fox Corporation) kept some stuff like the Fox US TV channel, the Fox Studio Lot (yeah, Disney doesn't own the lot their movie studio is based at), and the Fox Sports US TV Channel. 

Murdoch really wanted to keep the Fox name for himself which still causes a lot of confusion. Disney renamed most of their Fox stuff and removed the Fox part, but not all of it. There's still currently a Disney subsidiary named Fox Networks Group which operates international TV channels using the Fox branding. Yeah, if you live outside the US and you see a Fox TV channel somewhere in your channel list, that's owned by Disney, not Fox Corporation."
Buy It Now,"I've never watched a single reality show on there, I'm too busy with its vast catalog of old horror and exploitation/grindhouse stuff. I never understand the people who bitch about not enough mainstream ""hit"" crap being on it."
Buy It Now,Tubi is not a bunch of reality shows. They actually have traded a bunch of big titles back and forth for years with bigger services. It is NOT a service full of fox crap.
Buy It Now,"Tubi is ridiculously good if you're a horror fan. Excellent selection of foreign movies, classics, and lower budget/indie gems."
Buy It Now,"2 billion isn't a crazy valuation in the entertainment/tech world these days (that is, amongst the giants). People are reporting that Hulu is potentially worth 28 billion. 

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/as-disney-doubles-down-on-streaming-strategy-iger-hints-hulu-might-be-on-the-block-133309161.html"
Buy It Now,On Amazon prime tubi is a free app with movies and shows with commercials
Buy It Now,Tubi is huge in horror movie circles. It usually has one of the best selections of horror films amongst all the streamers and it’s free.
Buy It Now,Or younger people who like older stuff
Buy It Now,"Tubi also does alot of what has been a tentpole of these free ad supported services, which is just having ""channels"" akin to linear tv that let you to say run an endless marathon of like cop or reality shows to run in the background"
Buy It Now,"Disney rebranded previously known as fox content as ""20th century"" films"
Buy It Now,Murdoch fox. I think disney would have sold it by now or merged it into D+ if they had ownership
Buy It Now,Your GF should get therapy if a television commercial is “quite distressing” to her. That doesn’t sound healthy.
Buy It Now,My man came out of a 2.5 year hibernation for this comment.
Buy It Now,MXC? Where is that? Never seen it on Tubi.
Buy It Now,"That's a good point, but those ads still sell for the highest amounts of the year. Even if Fox was essentially using it on themselves I think it must mean they're trying to make Tubi a much bigger platform than I think of it as being (kinda like all those Paramount+ ads a year or two ago) or else why not just sell the ad space?"
Buy It Now,I fell for it for a second bc it was right after 9 when the bar I was watching it at technically closed so I thought they were trying to get people to leave lol
Buy It Now,I was shitfaced so it felt real. Sorry bartender for my cursing.
Buy It Now,I was in a bar and the whole place went nuts lol
Buy It Now,My girlfriend and I were two high dipshits who fell for it and were fumbling to find the remote.
Buy It Now,The memes all over Twitter today were about the Tubi commercial that made everyone scream at the person with the remote
Buy It Now,"She-Hulk pulled a similar move in the finale, only with the Disney+ interface.  It was brilliant!   

I fell for it (I thought I had somehow sat on my remote), so knew what was going on with the Tubi spot."
Buy It Now,"For people like Murdoch, media is more like real estate than stock trading. Even if you offered him a more than fair price, he might prefer to hang onto one of the ad-streaming services with the most potential for long-term growth and influence."

Buy It Now,"Which was one of the names of the company's predecessors. Fox Films was a studio from the silent era, and owned a chain of theaters. 20th Century Pictures launched in the early sound era, but had no theater chain. When Fox Films ran into financial trouble during the Great Depression, 20th Century bought Fox, and 20th Century Fox was born.

Fun fact that the famous 20th Century Fox intro originated with [20th Century Pictures](https://youtu.be/9jgWvn7EIrQ).

Before that, Fox used [a different intro](https://youtu.be/HdnYCnwHXIc), which was dropped after the merger."

Dark Desire,"Things worth noting:

- Vikings: Valhalla had a good second week but not a great one. It got the equivalent of 16.7 million complete viewings. Up from 11.9 million in the first week. A good performance but one of the lower second week gains for a “big” drama lately. 

- Inventing Anna finished week four with an impressive 7.7 million. Roughly the same as week one figures! An excellent hold and the first time I’ve seen numbers hold up like that outside of Squid Game. It finished its 4 week run with 47.9 million. Making it the biggest hit series on Netflix since Cobra Kai s4. The biggest show of 2022 so far just edging out All of Us Are Dead. 

- Two new arrivals had OK starts. Pieces of Her got an OK opening of 7.8 million. The hit of the week was docuseries Worst Roommate Ever which got a very impressive 13 million opening week! 

- Cuphead was solid again netting another 4 million viewings in its third week. This has been a shock hit. 

- Juvenile Justice bounced back a tiny bit from a dreadful week one (1.6 million) to hit 4.5 million viewings in its second week. Still the worst South Korean original post Squid Game but a small recovery and more solid week two numbers. 

- Five of the ten foreign language slots were filled with South Korean shows this week. Impressive! With Forecasting Love & Weather, Twenty Five Twenty One, Business Proposal, Thirty Nine, and Love ft Marriage & Divorce s3 all running weekly through April it probably explains why April is the first month in ages without a Netflix original South Korean show scheduled for the service. 

- Midnight at the Pera Palace made the charts in it first week but only managed 1.8 million viewings. After failing to make the charts in their opening week both Back to 15 (4.7 million) and Fame Game (1.9 million) did chart in their second week. 

- Space Force, Murderville, and Young Wallander s2 all failed to chart…again! It is fair to say these three shows have been massive flops for Netflix. Especially the expensive Space Force. 

The shows to look out for next week are The Last Kingdom s5, Queen of the South s5, and Formula 1 Drive to Survive s4. On the foreign language side they have Love Life & Everything in Between and An Astrological Guide to Broken Hearts s2 arriving. Probably going to be a quiet week for them outside of the F1 show. Looks like they are focusing on The Adam Project movie as the big drop of the coming week and avoiding any big hitting competition on the TV slate."
Dark Desire,"Juvenile Justice is a good watch. It slips into silliness on occasion, and some of the directing choices are a bit too on the nose, but it’s very enjoyable. Korea are just cranking out quality shows left and right at the minute. 

Midnight at the Pera Palace is decent if you’re after something light with a bit of Turkish history thrown in."
Dark Desire,"Nice to see that despite some negative comments, Valhalla is performing excellently."
Dark Desire,Cuphead's figures are impressive considering how short the episodes are. I haven't watched it. Is it worth it for someone who hasn't played the game?
Dark Desire,Of course it is. Most people don't give a damn that there's a half black woman in the cast.
Dark Desire,"It’s the same old groups of people who kept bashing it. By now, we all know who they are and we all know what they are doing.

The show started at around 6.2 imdb score and has increased to 7.2 which is very impressive, plus indicates that review bombing exists."
Dark Desire,"I hadn't even read that was something people were upset about, however it's (depressingly) not a surprise to hear that."
Dark Desire,"The problem is that they gender and race flipped an actual historical character, Jarl Haakon - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haakon_Sigurdsson

Had they simply invented a fictional character that was a half-black Viking there would be no issue with that, as Vikings actually went as far as Africa through their south incursions and technically mixed race Vikings would be possible. She even explains at some point that her grandfather met her grandmother in Africa.

Edit: someone posted [this link](https://www.newsweek.com/vikings-valhalla-jarl-haakon-real-person-black-viking-female-leader-caroline-henderson-1682608) below explaining that the Jarl Haakon from the show is not intended to be the real Jarl Haakon and is actually inspired in an amalgamation of characters. Anyhow, the article itself observes that ""History buffs may assume Jarl Haakon is based on the real historical figure also known as Haakon Sigurdsson"", which was likely the case for everyone. It wouldn't have hurt if they had used a fictional name without a clash with historical ones."
Dark Desire,History buffs would know that Kattegat is a fictional place not a historical place so they would understand she isn't Haakon Sigurdsson who was ruler of Norway. Also her character's name is Estrid Haakon.
Dark Desire,"Who cares, Vikings has never been historically accurate. Why kick up a fuss about it and let the dozens of other historical inaccuracies go without issue?"
Dark Desire,"Except they didn't  gender and race flipped an actual historical character. It is just people like you keep spreading misinformation because of ill intent.  They invented a fictional character who was inspired by male and female characters from the Viking era. Kattegat is literally a fictional place and she rules Kattegat but Haakon Sigurdsson was ruler of Norway.

https://www.newsweek.com/vikings-valhalla-jarl-haakon-real-person-black-viking-female-leader-caroline-henderson-1682608"
Dark Desire,"Vikings is known to be historically inaccurate in many cases, but you draw the line on black women?

The whole last season is based on a completely invented geopolitical event."
Dark Desire,"Vikings always had historical inaccuracies, the fact that a town leader could just take someone's plunder, the shaman or whatever who looked like he was from a horror movie rather than an actual person, shieldmaidens and probably a bunch of other stuff this is just season 1 or so. Still I never remember it having such a gross historical inaccuracy, a black viking and female leader is nonsense. Just like how a white male Penthesilea Queen of the Amazons would be nonsense."
Dark Desire,Because that's something that *looks* unusual and automatically drives to the history books lots of people that would otherwise just enjoy the show. =)
Dark Desire,"I get it, black person = bad"
Dark Desire,So race is the answer. Yikes. People really need to get a grip of themselves.
Dark Desire,"And you=ignorant, do you just believe that anyone that has an opinion which challenges yours on a sensitive topic is automatically just a troll or some word that ends in ist?"
Dark Desire,"Things worth noting:

- The big winner of the week is All of Us Are Dead. It gained the equivalent of 19.5 million completions in week two. That is a figure that brings it in line with Netflix’s biggest hits of recent times like Cobra Kai, The Witcher, and Emily in Paris. Squid Game got a lot more but that show is just an absolute monster and an anomaly. Be interesting to see if All of Us Are Dead can mimic Squid Game and peak in week 3 or if week 2 will be the peak as it is for almost all Netflix drama series. 

- The Women in the House Across the Street From the Girl in the Window also had a fantastic week. The viewing hours metric favours longer runtime shows but the reality was this show got 17.8 million completions in its second week. Nearly matching All of Us Are Dead! A very good week two. 

- Ozark slowed down in week three. It got the equivalent of 6.5 million completions. It has been a solid performer for Netflix but lags a good bit behind shows like Emily in Paris and The Witcher in terms of viewership. 

- In From the Cold looks DOA. It got 6.7 million completions in week two (up from 3.7 million week one) but is one of the worst performing Netflix English language shows of recent times. 

- New arrivals Raising Dion (9.1 million) and Sweet Magnolias (5.1 million) had decent opening weeks. The numbers for Raising Dion were particularly impressive. Murderville failed to chart meaning it got less than 5 million. The metric simply does not favour short run time comedies like Murderville or After Life. 

- It was a good opening weekend for Dark Desire s2 with the equivalent of 5.8 million completions meaning it pipped a number of English language originals! 

- I’ve not crunched the numbers for I Am Georgina but it has racked up impressive numbers for two weeks in a row so it is fair to assume it has been a big hit for the service. 

One other small thing of note: this is actually just Feria: The Darkest Light’s second week on Netflix. For the curious it garnered 2.4 million completions. 

All in all this was a good week for Netflix with both All of Us Are Dead and The Woman in the House performing at the top end of Netflix shows in the last 7 months. Then they had some solid performances from the supporting shows."
Dark Desire,I think we can basically gaurentee The Woman in the House Across the Street from the Girl in the Window a S02 at this point.
Dark Desire,"I started In From The Cold, but it just didn't grap me at all. Even though in theory it sounds like something I would like. 

Ive only heard bad things about The Woman in the House Across the Street from the Girl in the Window, mostly that it is supposed to be a parody, but that it just falls flat. But apparantly there are people watching it, so maybe I should give it a chance."
Dark Desire,They listed it as a limited series but given the excellent ratings it will be interesting to see if they try to bring it back. They probably need it considering how poorly the comedy genre has done for them lately!
Dark Desire,"Yeah, the only real thing that's popping in the numbers in the last while has been Emily in Paris. And neither this show nor Emily In Paris are critical darlings. Netflix needs to step up its game."
Dark Desire,"I’m not sure what has gone awry at Netflix in terms of comedy hits but something definitely has as they have cancelled 18/24 comedies launched across 2020 and 2021. That is an abysmal record. Most have sank with hitting with either viewers or critics. 

At least Emily in Paris and now The Woman in the Window were big hits with viewers. 

As for award winning shows? I think Netflix seem to be struggling in that department since axing senior TV executive Cindy Holland and replacing her with Bela Bejaria. Bejaria has found a bunch of hit shows with the viewers but seems to be struggling to win over award voters with her commissions. 

Be interesting to see how Inventing Anna fares. Netflix have been pushing it hard and I do think they had hopes it could be this years Queen’s Gambit or Maid. Unfortunately for them the critics do not seem to be taking to the show. We will see in the next couple of weeks how regular viewers feel. I think The Woman in the House was another Netflix awards hopeful that seems to have meet a lukewarm response from critics but the failure there was mitigated by the fact it has proven to be a viewer hit. Be interesting to see if the same thing happens for Investing Anna. 

Netflix definitely need some new comedy shows though as a lot of their awards friends stuff like Grace & Frankie, The Kominsky Method, Glow, Dead to Me, and After Life have wrapped or are heading into final seasons. There does not seem to be any replacements on the horizon."
Dark Desire,"Things worth noting:

- It was an excellent third week for Inventing Anna. Week three (13 million) beat week one (7.7 million) and that is still pretty rare for Netflix shows. It is a sign of good word of mouth. It has racked up the equivalent of just over 40 million complete viewings over three weeks and should hit around 45-46 million by the week four mark. That will make it a decent hit for Netflix and have it just behind stuff like Cobra Kai and Emily in Paris and about level with All of Us Are Dead. 

- It was an OK opening week for Vikings: Valhalla. It got the equivalent of 11.9 million complete viewings. That is solid. If it jumps week two we can consider it a hit. 

- One of Us is Lying got 5.2 million week two. Pretty solid considering it is not in the US domestic market. It beat stuff like Space Force, Murderville, and Young Wallander comfortably and those shows were everywhere! It has been a solid pick-up. 

- Space Force s2 finally charts with 3.8 million week two! Pretty awful. This must be headed for cancellation. It cannot be cheap to make with the talent involved and it gets beat by limited region buy-ins like One of Us is Lying and animated shows like Cuphead! 

- Raising Dion s2, Sweet Magnolias s2 , and Dark Desire s2 wrapped their 4 week run with totals of 20.2 million, 17.7 million, and 15.4 million respectively. Solid but unspectacular for the English language shows but pretty impressive numbers for Dark Desire! 

- Cuphead exceeded expectations again by growing from 5 million week one to 7.2 million week two. It is definitely a surprise hit! 

- Terrible start for Juvenile Justice. It just got the equivalent of 1.6 million complete viewings opening week. By far the worst of any post-Squid Game South Korean original by a large distance and easily being beat by licensed weekly shows like Forecasting Love and Weather and Twenty Five, Twenty One both of which only released their opening couple of episodes. 

- Two new foreign language shows Fame Game and Back to 15 failed to chart opening week putting them below 1.8 million and 3 million respectively. Not a great start for either show though they probably did not fare much worse than Juvenile Justice!  

- Fishbowl Wives and Devotion: A Story of Love and Desire chart again but with 1.9 million and 2.6 million they are definitely not big hits. 

- Poor Young Wallander s2 joins After Life s3 and Murderville as rare English language shows that just fail to make the charts. 

Overall it looks like viewership at Netflix was down this week on the whole compared to previous weeks. Mostly thanks to shows like Space Force, Young Wallander, Disenchantment, Murderville, and Juvenile Justice all flopping and not holding or gaining any decent numbers. 

Next week Pieces of Her is the big English language release to look out for in the charts with Midnight at the Pera Palace, Lies and Deceit, and Savage Rhythm the non-English titles due for release."
Dark Desire,"Vikings is at number 1 now. It was released on the 25th (end of the week) which is presumably why is 2nd here.

Agree about Space Force, but wish it was higher up as I really want this to continue. Guess it depends on what the budget was."
Dark Desire,Almost done with Inventing Anna. What a Bullshit show that wastes so much time getting to the fucking point. This should be 4-6 hours tops.
Dark Desire,"Things worth noting:

- It was an excellent second week for Inventing Anna. After a middling first week (7.7 million) it got the equivalent of 19.5 million complete viewings in its second week. That brings it in line with the best weeks of Netflix hits like Cobra Kai, The Witcher, and Emily in Paris. Though those shows did two weeks of that type of number rather than just a single week. It performed similarly to All of Us Are Dead!

- All of Us Are Dead (44.2 million), In From the Cold (12.8-14.5 million), and The Woman in the House (39.3 million) completed their 4 week run that Netflix loves. Two of the bunch were big hits. In From the Cold…not so much. Both the other shows topped the 4 week total for the latest season of Ozark (35.3 million). Impressive stuff! 

- Sweet Magnolias and Raising Dion chugged along in their third weeks with 3.5 million and 3.3 million complete viewings respectively. Not bad but neither show are big hits. I’ll be super interested to see if these middling ratings performers are going to do good enough for a third season renewal. 

- Space Force s2 and Young Wallander s2 failed to chart in their opening week. Which meant less than 3.4 million for Space Force s2 and less than 2.7 million for Young Wallander s2. Pretty poor for both! It shows why the performance of shows like Raising Dion and Sweet Magnolias might be good enough to stick around! Murderville failed to chart again on week 2 meaning it got less than 3.3 million. All flops. 

- One of Us is Lying got 2.4 million complete viewings week one in the charts. Not bad for a show that is not on in its biggest market (The US). 

- Cuphead was a big winner! I did not expect it to pop up in the charts due to its tiny runtime but thanks to the fact it got 5 million complete viewings in its first week it made the chart! 

- Both Fishbowl Wives (2.8 million) and Devotion: A Story of Love and Desire (4.7 million) charted in their opening weeks. Pretty solid for Devotion! I’d expect a drop second week though as both got an unusual Monday release. 

I never did the numbers for Love is Blind but it is clear the show is another reality hit for Netflix. 

Vikings: Valhalla is the big release to look out for next week. On the foreign language side we have another South Korean show in Juvenile Justice to look out for as well as Fame Game from India."
Dark Desire,Space Force only came out on the 18th. I assume it will be on next week.
Dark Desire,It would be nice if these numbers were adjusted for the length of the show. A half hour show with the same amount of episodes as a full hour show has to get twice as many viewers to get on these lists.
Dark Desire,"None of that appeals to me at all, glad I cancelled Netflix. I'm even a cuphead addict but I'm not going to support that garbage."
Dark Desire,"Its crazy to me that Inventing Anna is doing that well. The source material is great, but the execution is a disaster. I'm happy for Anna Chlumsky tho."
Dark Desire,You are getting downvotes but I agree with you. I’d rather they gave the equivalent completions data. I’ve calculated a bunch of that data myself and included it in my own post. The viewing hours metric absolutely favours shows with long run times.
Dark Desire,"You’re being downvoted but there are literally only 2 shows here which have above average critic scores. Most of them don’t even have reviews lol

This is why I don’t like how people get defensive when someone complains about the quality of Netflix material. Sure they produce the same amount of good stuff as other streamers, but it’s frustrating when they do so despite releasing so much more content than other streamers."
Dark Desire,Thank you. I've been paying for Netflix for 10 years but 3 weeks ago let it cancel and my wife hasn't even noticed yet. She prefers peacock or even Pluto tv with tons of ads.
Dark Desire,"Things worth noting:

- All of Us Are Dead held well in its third week on the chart and was the top TV show of the week not only by viewing hours but by the far more relevant complete viewings metric. It pulled in the equivalent of 9.3 million completions this week. It has more viewings in three weeks than the latest season of Ozark managed in four weeks. It has been a big hit for Netflix!

- Inventing Anna had an OK start but nothing special. It got the equivalent of 7.7 million complete view in its first week. It will definitely do better week two but how big the jump is will be crucial for how successful this show ends up being for Netflix. 

- Sweet Magnolias (6.9 million) and Raising Dion (5.6 million) both did OK in their second weeks but are not trending to be one of Netflix’s more popular English language series. Sweet Magnolias second week increase was a little disappointing while Raising Dijon’s week two decline was also a bit disappointing for it. Both have performed OK over the opening few weeks so I’ll be interested to see if that is considered good enough for renewal or not by Netflix in the coming months. Sweet Magnolias in particular does not look an expensive show to produce. 

- The Woman in the House Across the Street from the Girl in the Window has been an excellent performer for Netflix. It got the equivalent of 6.5 million complete viewings in its third week. That puts it at around 36 million total over its first three weeks in the charts. That is good! Netflix finally have a hit comedy and unfortunately it was a limited series! 

- In From the Cold just made the list in week three with 2.4 million complete viewings. It has been one of the worst performing English language shows of recent releases. A few comedies like After Life and Murderville failed to chart but for all we know might have performed better. The charts do not favour shows with short overall runtimes. 

- Dark Desire s2 had a decent second week with 5.1 million complete viewings but Toy Boy s2 had a quiet opening with just 2.4 million completions in its opening week on the chart. Until Life Do Us Part, a Portuguese dramadey, failed to chart in its opening week. 

Space Force s2, Young Wallander s2, and One of Us is Lying are the big English language TV shows to watch out for next week while in the foreign language category we have Devotion: A Story of Love and Desire, Fishbowl Wives, and Secrets of Summer all hoping to make an impression on the chart!"
Dark Desire,"I always expect these ""top watched shows"" correlate with whatever Netflix wants on the frontpage. Like, back when I had netflix the most watched was often the one highlighted. It's not really that much of a surprise. Like, take a terrible show/movie and put it on the frontpage + tell everyone that this is the most watched show/movie = profit."
Dark Desire,Season 2 of Raising Dion was......Interesting
Dark Desire,"All of Us Are Dead is a hit and Sweet Magnolias looks like a solid mid level performer for them 

Disenchantment Season 4 flopped, for a returning veteran show I expect at least one solid week in the top 5. It didn't even show up on the other Netflix top 10 thing.

In from the Cold and The Silent Sea are the most DOA of new Netflix shows of the last few months"
Dark Desire,Thanks for the break down.
Dark Desire,I think just throwing up various minutes watched for various length shows with world wide viewer data is already munging things up enough that it's impossible to tell what actually is and isn't popular.
Dark Desire,"The Silent Sea performed decent enough. It got the equivalent of around 15-17 million complete viewings over four weeks in the charts. Nothing special but better than a lot of shows. The big negative for The Silent Sea is the fact it was the least popular of the 4 Korean shows that have followed Squid Game. D.P, the Korean show that released before Squid Game, got renewed with a 4 week viewership of under 9 million. Though it is fair to say it was not as expensive to produce as The Silent Sea. 

For perspective Narcos Mexico s3 got 13 million over the same timeframe. Locke & Key s2 got about 18 million. After Life s2 got around 7 million. Lost in Space s3 got 18 million. Archive 81 got around 18-20 million. 

All is not lost for The Silent Sea!"
Dark Desire,I agree.
Dark Desire,"Maybe. My method is to track by netflix top 10 (giving 10 points to #1, 9 points to #2), since I started tracking in December Silent Sea is my lowest ranked new show of the ones that made it with 5th on its debut and then off the chart. In from the Cold did 9, 6 then off, Bebop had 2, 9 then off."
Dark Desire,"Tracking by viewing hours or equivalent views (my favourite metric of those available) is far more relevant than tracking by Top 10 points. If only because where you land in the Top 10 can vary by competition but viewing hours and equivalent views are solid regardless. 

Which is to say some weeks the 5th placed Top 10 show or movie could beat the best in another week. Just depends on when a popular run of shows come along. Unfortunately for The Silent Sea it got released alongside four of Netflix most popular shows of the last 6 months in Money Heist, The Witcher, Emily in Paris, and Cobra Kai. Those shows were absolute monsters and that made an OK performing The Silent Sea look bad by comparison.

Bebop was a massive flop by every metric. It only got around 10-11 million complete viewings. Even In the Cold is going to beat that!"
Dark Desire,You appear to be using global which is also why you have the total hours viewed and why shows like Emily in Paris do better than in my ranking where it is more of a mid level success. I am using US.
Dark Desire,I watched the shit out of this show. My 14yo ass thought Jessica Alba was the hottest woman ever to exist.
Dark Desire,"I swear those FOX bastards were trying to sabotage every show I enjoyed by moving it to that cursed Friday death slot. There's even a [Wiki entry](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friday_night_death_slot) for it.

Brisco County Jr, Firefly, Dollhouse, The Sarah Connor Chronicles, just to name a few others."
Dark Desire,"Young Jensen Ackles was really yummy on that show.  I remember hearing a lot of behind the scenes drama when he was cast to be Max's love interest, because Michael Weatherly was the co-lead (and also dating Jessica Alba) and worried about his future on the show and made a big stink about not pairing Alba and Ackles and tried to get him fired.  I think Ackles even mentioned that in one of his interviews on Michael Rosenbaum's podcast.

So it wasn't a shocker to me to find out Weatherly was also a huge douche to Eliza Dushku."
Dark Desire,I am literally in progress on this show right now lol. I am on Jensen Ackles' first episode! I heard about it many years ago when I started Supernatural and it was always on my list to check out and I finally started it :P.
Dark Desire,I loved the first season.  The second season got a little too weird for me.
Dark Desire,I watched it but I barely recall anything about it except that it's the first thing I saw Jensen Ackles in and that I thought Jessica Alba was absolutely gorgeous. I'm sure I watched both seasons so I must have enjoyed it.
Dark Desire,I loved the first season. Then they introduced the dog hybrid brother in season 2 and I fell off big time.
Dark Desire,"It had a lot of potential for worldbuilding and I liked it overall; 

I wouldn't mind a remake set in 30-40 yrs. 

Points of improvement though:

1. go beyond Seattle into other cities/states over seasons
2. make it about more than one nuke that set of an EMP- that won't be enough to set back the US the way the show makes it out to be
3. if they're gonna have 20-episode seasons (and I hope they do), then make some larger arcs through the seasons that scale up the stakes at a slower pace
   1. first season should be about finding some fellow x5's and battling crime/corruption at a base level across Seattle + western US
   2. second season should introduce the government trying to recapture Max and the x5's; perhaps succeeding at the end; small crime + corruption stories inbetween
   3. third season is 50% about her escape and flight through the US to throw off the scent, and 50% about settling back into life as usual; peaking with that wierd cult discovering the x5s
   4. fourth season should be taking on the wierd cult in private; more focus on x5's and other civilian-run genetically enhanced operating underground across the US
   5. 5th season should be about going public; there should be an underground movement to get the VERY genetically enhanced somewhere safe.  Maybe end here the original show did?
   6. 6th onwards could be questionable but I'd like to see the final stakes being genetically enhanced from other countries -like China playing a huge role in some kind of international incident- end with a joint US against some external baddy."
Dark Desire,"I absolutely loved this show. Bought the box sets and even the crappy game they made for Xbox/PS2. I do think the quality really dropped in the second season, and that’s also when they injured the wrestler Lita on the set and derailed her career at its peak, so teenage me was very angry at the time lol."
Dark Desire,"I remember some speculation that at least part of the reason for the show's decline in ratings may have been because of September 11th. In the aftermath of 9/11, the concept of ""America is attacked by a nuke and reduced to a third world country"" didn't sound as entertaining to people."
Dark Desire,"One of the worst victims of Fox's deliberate sabotage, and meddling with a good concept."
Dark Desire,Loved this show. It was dark and edgy.
Dark Desire,I just remember some press event announcing it and thinking Jessica Alba is hot AF
Dark Desire,Who does but all I remember is Alba.
Dark Desire,They set up season 3 so well too..
Dark Desire,"Oh yes, the start of my boyhood crush on Jessica Alba. It was also fairly good TV, at the time. My brother and I followed it for a bit. Guess I'd forgotten it was a James Cameron project."
Dark Desire,At one point my favorite tv show.  Haven't watched it since it aired. Think I need to find some dvds.
Dark Desire,Great pilot. The rest of the episodes were disappointing for me. Never finished it.
Dark Desire,I loved Dark Angel. I had a crush on Jessica Alba and Jensen Ackles. I read book series after season2.
Dark Desire,"Yup, loved that show.."
Dark Desire,I got both seasons on dvd. There were 3 (I think) books written that take place after the 2nd season that were okay. I had them but they got wet when my basement flooded. Loved the show.
Dark Desire,"I think all of us old enough to remember, remember this show fondly. Yet it hasn’t made to streaming  & what copies on dvd or Blu Ray you can buy on Amazon or EBay are extremely overpriced!"
Dark Desire,i didn’t find this one until a few years after it was over but it wasn’t bad
Dark Desire,"There were also 3 novels after it was canceled, one prequel, and 2 sequels."
Dark Desire,"It was a great show!

I think it had the biggest drop in quality between season one and season two that I've ever seen.

The world building was great, interesting story, well-cast, and with James Cameron directing and Jessica Alba as the lead it was almost sure to be a hit.

I think what happened (pure conjecture I know nothing about the financials) was that the show was too expensive to make for the good but not stellar ratings it got. So, they had to cut the budget way, way back."
Dark Desire,"That was my Friday night TV jam.  Season 2, Idk what they did other than introduce the mutants, but somehow I lost track."
Dark Desire,I have the DVDs and SO and I watch it fairly regularly.
Dark Desire,">A few decades ago

Ok take it easy buddy. It was \~22 years ago."
Dark Desire,It's funny how their dystopian near-future Seattle is still somehow safer and less decayed than current-day Seattle.
Dark Desire,"Great first season, second season completely lost its way. They even had an ""it was all a dream"" episode. They just didn't know what to do with the premise and it showed."
Dark Desire,"Man, reading the synopsis of both seasons on Wikipedia was a wild ride. Season one sounds like a fairly normal futuristic action show. And then you get to season two and it descends into some kind of drug fueled psychosis with millennia old breeding cults and dog human hybrids."
Dark Desire,I have the set on DVD. Very underrated.
Dark Desire,Ah yes the show where weatherly used it as a opportunity to groom alba when she was 18 and he was 30.
Dark Desire,We were vacationing and met Richard Gunn who played Sketchy on a liquor cruise on a catamaran. He was there with his mum.
Dark Desire,Michael Weatherly and Jessica alba. My younger me remembers .
Dark Desire,I watched the first season. It was funny how hyped up this show was and then it was suddenly gone again.
Dark Desire,"I’ve always presumed this show was Cameron’s way of putting some of his ideas for Battle Angel and Avatar on screen years before he could make those projects with the budgets he wanted. The Battle Angel influence is pretty obvious, but Weatherly’s character ends up a paraplegic who who later regains the ability to walk through assimilating with his love interest’s “kind” in a way that has echoes of Avatar, not to mention some of the season two gene wackiness has undertones for the way the avatars work in the films. There might be other parallels I can’t remember - haven’t watched it in years and years, but it’s interesting from that angle if you’re studying Cameron’s filmography."
Dark Desire,"Awesome plot and acting, second year got weird though"
Dark Desire,"i loved this show, watched it twice. considering the time it was made, it was pretty good. so much potential, i think a remake could do really well nowadays at the right channel/platform. Amazon could be a good fit, maybe Hulu.

however the best thing about the show to me was Jensen Ackles, and he couldn't be Alec in the remake now so that sucks. 

always found it so odd that a James Cameron show would be cancelled after only 2 seasons. whoever decided to move the show to friday nights fucked up. it deserved a proper ending."
Dark Desire,"Yeah, I remember the pilot episode not being very flashy for all thr hype they made it about it being made by Cameron and it being expensive. I don't think there was much in the way of big action scenes.

Their profession of being Gen-X looking couriers, I thought it was kinda silly and forced.  Now that I think about it, they attempted that same premise with Mirrors Edge from DICE and EA.

Ended up being annoyed by the show when the news hit that Michael Weatherly ended up hooking up and somehow duping an absolute-peak Jessica Alba into an engagement. So everything the opening credits roll, I see his smug face. Even back then, I knew there was something annoying about that guy. Those gut feelings were verified when I heard he was being investigated for acting like a sexist douche on his Bull television series.

Lastly, I didn't know he would save his career with Supernatural, but Jensen Ackles will always be the guy who had the shitty plastic LED eye in Season 2. That's when I knew that the show had become pure crap, when it had been a full 10 years after Terminator 2, and they weren't bothering with makeup  and just taping a crappy piece of plastic with a red LED onto this guy's eye."
Dark Desire,First season was good. Shocked we haven’t seen a remake
Dark Desire,"I remember it, but the only time I ever really paid any attention to it was all the hubbub around one of the show's stunt people dropping WWE's Lita during her guest spot and breaking her neck."
Dark Desire,"I remember after i think the first or second season they fired all the actors over the age of 30 except the antagonist guy, possibly to try to appeal to youth. It didn't work and the show died"
Dark Desire,I remember it was randomly on the SciFi channel and I watched the first episode and thought it was alright mainly for Jessica. I never watched an episode after that.
Dark Desire,Didn't alba and ackles have mad beef on that show?
Dark Desire,"There were only two seasons? It felt longer, they covered alot it felt like a season of her running around, a season of the other escapes, a season of the more animal hybrid and a season of that weird Manticore shit. But yeah I guess only two"
Dark Desire,"I'm a little late to this but I'm so happy to find other people who remember this show. I absolutely loved it. It was one of my first times feeling so mad about a show being canceled. I even got the follow up books, I still have them somewhere. I torrented the show years ago and still watch it every year or so then read the books. I was a young teen when it came out but have always loved sci-fi and just thought the whole concept of the show was super interesting. I've always thought this would make a good show for some sort of reboot on a streaming platform or something."
Dark Desire,"I never understood the Reagan worshipping boss, literally named Normal.  Bip bip bip!"
Dark Desire,"In the first episode,  when she climbs out of the pool wearing a red dress - a defining moment for adolescent me."
Dark Desire,"I mean, she was."
Dark Desire,Jessica Alba and Sarah Michelle Gellar were my favorites growing up haha
Dark Desire,I watched every episode.  The Alba made my pants fit funny.
Dark Desire,She was
Dark Desire,"Aaaaand, now JA is worth over $100M

Dark Desire,I think this might be the only reason I watched the show in its entirety
Skin Decision: Before and After,"I do it as a basis of scheduling.

If I find out a show is cancelled without closure, I don’t bother watching."
Skin Decision: Before and After,"What's difficult for me about this is that the show's that are in their first or second season who inevitably get cancelled, didn't have the viewership to begin with *because* people were waiting for like season 3 or 4 so they can binge it when they have the time and interest in a longer show to enjoy.  


It's a snake eating its own tail. The network/streamer cancels the show that doesn't get ratings vs viewers not watching it as it comes out because they've been burned before by cancelled shows they wait for more content to watch it lol"
Skin Decision: Before and After,"The real abomination is cliffhanger endings. 

When I commit myself to a season of television, I want closure at the end. 

A contrived cliffhanger ending is a cheap and unnecessary trick."
Skin Decision: Before and After,The Babysitters Club was cancelled?! Nooooo! That was such a cute shot of nostalgia
Skin Decision: Before and After,"As someone in the UK, I hate when a show is cancelled with the excuse of poor viewing figures, but it's neither advertised or not available till 6 months after airing in the US if made available at all"
Skin Decision: Before and After,"Finally, some data to hear what I've heard anecdotally A LOT over the last couple of years."
Skin Decision: Before and After,"Yeah it depends on the show.  But I will do this for some shows.


My wife is really like this tho, she almost always waits until is finished before watching.  We’ve been burned so many times before especially with Network tv before streaming was big and they’d cancel them mid season smh"
Skin Decision: Before and After,"Well, yeah.

Paper Girls. Good show, didn't deserve to be cancelled. I think we were five episodes in when it was announced, and then just gave up because we just didn't see the point.

The kicker is that it, and hundreds of cancelled shows just like it, are littering streaming services. With every show we choose to watch we have to look up whether it's been cancelled, or if it's popular so we can gauge if it will be cancelled."
Skin Decision: Before and After,"In reading all of these comments, I find that there is a critical component of the problem that only a few point out: the market is oversaturated. There are too many shows. It's impossible to watch everything all at once. But the studio execs seem to maintain this mentality of making as many large budget shows as possible, in the hopes that a handful will become megahits. 

It's unsustainable."
Skin Decision: Before and After,I just wait for 2 seasons before I start watching most shows.
Skin Decision: Before and After,"\*gasp\*

well imagine that.

constantly cancelling shows after one season becuase they didnt break the ratings in 5 secs has affected viewership.

who could have possibly seen that coming?

im not sure how many /s's to append to this, so just assume infinite sarcasm please."
Skin Decision: Before and After,">A quarter of U.S. adults wait for streaming originals’ finale before starting, citing fears over the show’s potential cancellation with an unresolved ending (27%) or because they do not want to wait for the next season after a cliffhanger (24%). Nearly half (48%) of the participants who said they prefer to wait until the series ends before starting it cited a preference for binge-watching shows."
Skin Decision: Before and After,Netflix: I didn’t do fuckin shit. I didn’t rig shit.
Skin Decision: Before and After,"Still mad about OA. And recently, 1899. Fucking hell

And yeah, Mindhunter"
Skin Decision: Before and After,I’m still so mad Dark Crystal Age of Resistance was cancelled.
Skin Decision: Before and After,I've started listening to audio books instead. Considerably less likely just stop before the story is over.
Skin Decision: Before and After,Only a quarter? That seems a little low
Skin Decision: Before and After,"Yeah cliffhangers at the end of seasons have the exact opposite intended effect... instead of making me drool with
anticipation, i think about the year+ i'll have to wait and i get annoyed. GET TO THE FUCKING POINT

Every season finale should behave as if its a series finale"
Skin Decision: Before and After,"I'm looking at you, Netflix!"
Skin Decision: Before and After,"This is mostly me. If there is a show I am interested on, but it didn't pop off, I won't be watching. However stuff like Rings of Power, Last of Us, Yellowjackets and more are on my list because I know their future is safe. 

Which basically means I watch the mainstream shows and ignore smaller, interesting and maybe even better projects.

And yes, The OA changed my watching habbits."
Skin Decision: Before and After,"I know it's been going on for decades, but I really wish they would stop making the season finale of a show a cliffhanger. Thankfully not all of them do it. 

There's other ways to wrap story beats up without leaving the viewers hanging with no resolution due to a cancellation. 

This is partly why I don't watch things until I know they have an ending."
Skin Decision: Before and After,Streaming services have spoiled us.  TV shows on networks get canceled all the time.  One of my favorite shows growing up was canceled in the middle of the 2nd season lol.   But what did we do?  We found another show.
Skin Decision: Before and After,"This just in - ""Show business execs are detached from reality, and don't give a fuck about what the viewers want."""
Skin Decision: Before and After,"There's  TV Tropes entry for this: [The Firefly Effect](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFireflyEffect). It's been happening for a while, not just with streaming.

I *still* think that streaming doesn't cancel shows any more or less than broadcast TV has ever done or does now, so I don't really feel like it's that big of a deal. 

I strongly suspect that most people in this sub don't understand that there are viewers-per-cost metrics people look very closely at, and chances are your favorite show didn't make the cut. I *do* think they probably wait too short of a time before they make the decision--streaming habits *are* different--but I also think they *know* this. They have more metrics than we every will."
Skin Decision: Before and After,Who the hell wants to invest 10+ hours into something with no ending? My time is valuable. Either the networks need to see a show through or they need to tell the writers to make every season completely self-contained.  No cliffhangers and no open ended bullshit.
Skin Decision: Before and After,"That’s me, 100%; I’m looking forward to starting Carnival Row this weekend when the last episodes come out. I’ve been burned too many times and I HATE cliffhangers. Finish your story while I am paying attention. Don’t leave me hanging so you can assure I’ll come back next year. Tell a good story and I’ll be counting down the days while telling everyone how great the show is. Drop a cliffhanger and I’m out, and trashing your crap storytelling every chance I get."
Skin Decision: Before and After,Especially if that show is on Netflix.  Apple TV on the other hand does a great job of sticking with their titles.
Skin Decision: Before and After,"I hate that some shows I love were cancelled after ending with HUGE cliffhangers, but at the same time I don't really regret watching those shows!

Cancelled shows are part of the life cycle of TV, and even though I have a hard time letting go, I can always rewatch things and just be glad that those episodes got made and are available"
Skin Decision: Before and After,It's funny I made a post about this about a month ago and I was told it wasn't happening.
Skin Decision: Before and After,"I'd bet  long-arc shows are more at risk of this cancellation phenomena than an old-style ""monster of the week"" show.

If I was a showrunner with a netflix commission I'd get rid of my fancy long arc and switch to an old style show where every episode can stand alone.

With the long arcs viewers want to sit down and digest in big chunks, so they wait until there's an arc completion to get to.  Unfortunately by the time the arc completion is broadcast those ""wait until it's fully baked"" viewers habits have sealed the shows fate by staying away.

This is just some stupid theory I've concocted based on nothing but guesses."
Skin Decision: Before and After,"I don’t get this sub sometimes. People complaining about cliffhanger season finales, and yet Severance gets praised, which has a HUGE cliffhanger"
Skin Decision: Before and After,I do this. Too many shows have burned me
Skin Decision: Before and After,"I'm a weirdo


I usually watch 1-2 episodes to see if I like it, then I will wait until the season is over so I know it actually had a finale"
Skin Decision: Before and After,I’m still pissed about Last Man on Earth
Skin Decision: Before and After,I love how the algorithm introduced me to Tuca and Bertie’s existence AFTER it got cancelled. Thank goodness for Adult Swim. The only animation that’s safe on Netflix these days is freaking Big Mouth.
Skin Decision: Before and After,"More shows need to be like Dark. 3 seasons, complete story, satisfying ending."
Skin Decision: Before and After,i wont watch attack on titan until it is done
Skin Decision: Before and After,here's to 22 more seasons of stargate
Skin Decision: Before and After,Last man on earth 😭😢😭
Skin Decision: Before and After,This is the way.
Skin Decision: Before and After,"I don’t even start watching a show until there is like 3 to 5 episodes out, so I can spread them out until the final. 

I blame the writers and how they write. You 10 episodes season but you only have enough material for 6 episodes. So you come up with a bunch bullshit filler. So you will have like 6 episodes really good and 4 bullshit filler episodes."
Skin Decision: Before and After,Sad about Pantheon never getting marketed properly or at all and getting cancelled. It supposedly had a second season that was already produced but might never get released.
Skin Decision: Before and After,I actually started this practice way before streaming was a thing. #Firefly
Skin Decision: Before and After,"I mean lately it seems like I find out shows exist when I see an article about them being axed. These companies aren’t giving things enough of a chance at all. If it’s good, people will find it, but not every show is going to be number 1 and go totally viral the first week."
Skin Decision: Before and After,"I feel like everyone forgot the good old days where they would randomly change the time a show aired without warning and then would cancel it mid-season, never to be seen again🤣"
Skin Decision: Before and After,I'm more and more in this boat. I'm not going to take the limited time I have to invest in a series that's going to end prematurely and without a real ending.
Skin Decision: Before and After,"I've been saying this (not that it's never been said) for a longgggggggggggggg time. It's a toxic relation that dates back to network TV shows. Pilot season starts and network TV shows beg you, with all of their promotional ads, to watch their shows. Give them a chance. Be a loyal viewer. Then when the viewership isn't good enough, which sometimes is based on realistic needs but often seems to be a desire for their show to be the next big hit, they cancel it. Each time it damages the relationship between content producer and viewer. After long enough I was done. I wasn't watching first seasons or even second seasons of shows, I was waiting. 

Then came streaming, it was great at first, but now so many shows get one season or two and then cancelled that I don't start watching. It is even more damaging for streaming because a large part of the value of their subscription service is tied to their library of content. Well, Netflix's library of content is a freaking grave yard of uncompleted series. Who the F\*\*\* wants to start a series that doesn't have any conclusion? It's like libraries only stocking book series that are missing the last 1-3 books of the series and they will never be released. 

So, now I say if streaming wants to survive or thrive they must change their way of business. There's the HBO model: being very picky with what is greenlit for maximum odds of success, investing heavily in the shows so their quality is as high as possible and having a relatively low amount of original programming. HBO pumps out S-tier quality shows but they pump them out slowly because they only put so much on their plate at a time. 

Or, the other option is to overwhelmingly prefer anthologies, mini series, and series that end in 1-3 seasons. From the start, no matter how successful the series, keep series its pre-planned length. [All these shows](https://www.whats-on-netflix.com/coming-soon/new-netflix-series-coming-in-2023-and-beyond/)? 80% or more should be 1-3 seasons long from the planning stage. Increase quality by reducing quantity of episodes. Make each series jam packed with story, character development and reduce fluff, filler and stretching out stories beyond their natural length. Netflix already cancels so many shows after S2 anyways, just make most shows 2 seasons long so their library starts to fill with easily binge-able series that have tight beginning, middles and most importantly; endings.

This would also encourage writers and creators to come to the table with Netflix with more than just a pitch for a pilot and a very loose, general outline and barely an ending. No, come to Netflix with at least most of the first season written and a strong outline for the second season and an even stronger outline for what the ending of the series is going to be. Reducing the ""up in the air, we'll write it as we go along, we'll make changes based on focus group testing's and how the viewers are reacting"" should help increase quality of series as well. 

I would also mention I imagine Netflix would all of a sudden become a very desirable place for writers and showrunners to want to work again. Instead of never knowing their shows numbers and being on edge expecting cancellation after their second season, they would know Netflix is the place to bring your mini series, 1-3 season long story or anthology story and get to make it, completely."
Skin Decision: Before and After,I haven't started a new show in my favorite genre since the OA was cancelled. Just realized it actually
Skin Decision: Before and After,And people said that this wouldn't happen.
Skin Decision: Before and After,"I used to disagree with this idea of waiting, but the cancellation of Reboot (Hulu) was the last straw for me. Give me a real finale, and I’ll watch the whole show start to finish. Otherwise I’m not getting invested"
Skin Decision: Before and After,"Why are smaller streamers not buying rights to these shows and making follow-up seasons?

Surely ratings/viewings that are ""too low"" for Netflix or HBO would work fine for others."
Skin Decision: Before and After,Show runners who write cliffhanger season endings should be fucking fired
Skin Decision: Before and After,Unpopular Opinion: most of the stuff that streaming services canceled `early` deserved to be canceled.
Skin Decision: Before and After,"Frankly, it strikes me as that so many people still watch stuff week to week."
Skin Decision: Before and After,My cousin's been doing this for years after Netflix cancelled a show he liked.
Skin Decision: Before and After,"Lmao yeah it’s not hard to understand. People in US like to act like we’re the only people who exist, but other countries still do the classic broadcasting format and get good ratings. UK (BBC specifically I believe) have like at least 3 prime time drama series that get good consistent ratings cause they’ve been on for like 20+ years. Why do you think the highest rated US series are NCIS, Law and Order, CSI, Greys Anatomy, etc.? Cause all those shows came out during a time where networks weren’t trigger happy to cancel everything, and are still going. Why do you think most modern network series get canceled today? Because that’s the expectation they set"
Skin Decision: Before and After,"Yes Netflix, I am not watching your shows anymore until I know they aren't going to be cancelled. And then you cancel them because no one is watching because they are waiting to see if you cancel the show. Nice little problem you've created for yourself by over green lighting things in an effort to stay on top."
Skin Decision: Before and After,"Right it's not exec bros that don't know what they're doing, it's the viewrship's fault."
Skin Decision: Before and After,/#SaveTheOA
Skin Decision: Before and After,"This is them reaping what they sow by ending each season on a cliffhanger.

Stop doing that so at least we can feel GOOD when we've watched that one season of a show."
Skin Decision: Before and After,Television exists to sell ads.  Period.  The shows are mindless fodder.  Networks give zero fecks about YOUR entertainment.  Toss the TV remote and go fly a kite.  Or take walk.
Skin Decision: Before and After,"Yeah, the whole “release an episode a week” just stops me from watching a show. I cancel the service and forget. Then remember a year later, and watch the whole in a week or whatever."
Skin Decision: Before and After,That’s a heck of a last sentence. Big twist ending there.
Skin Decision: Before and After,I’ve gotten really good at giving up on bad series or waiting until multiple seasons are out.
Skin Decision: Before and After,"I also love a good binge…

Edit: Except for mandalorian. I watch every episode and can’t wait for the next one. Same with the lord of the rings series, so good! Can’t wait to the end."
Skin Decision: Before and After,I do this with a lot of science fiction type shows on major networks. Too many times I have gotten invested in a show only for it to be cancelled season 1.
Skin Decision: Before and After,This is half of it. I also don't waste time watching anything that gets poor reviews.
Skin Decision: Before and After,I often wait for a full season to be out to start watching a new show.
Skin Decision: Before and After,I can't dedicate enough time to TV shows to bother with something that I either won't get closure on or have to wait months or years at a time for the next step.
Skin Decision: Before and After,"I guess I am one of those who wait as I am not a ""diehard"" viewer of most shows, ""hot"" or not.   I can just sit it out, wait for the ruckus to die down, then catch it later. As dedicated viewers breathlessly wait for each episode of The Last of Us. or whatever is hot at the moment,  I am one of those who simply add the show to my queue, to be watched at some future date. 

I never realized my viewing habits had life or death ramifications for at risk series. Goodness!"
Skin Decision: Before and After,"I usually watch as the episodes come out, sometimes I’ll wait a few weeks. It depends on how much time I have. I spend all of it looking for work now."
Skin Decision: Before and After,I’m not afraid of cancellation. I’m afraid that I’ll start watching a show tomorrow and it will continue for ten years with a lackluster resolution.
Skin Decision: Before and After,"I typically don't watch new shoes until they are old shows now. If it REALLY popular, I'll catch up to watch the last season live (Breaking Bad, Game of Thrones to name a few)"
Skin Decision: Before and After,"I've been doing this for years. I wait for whole seasons at a time to finish with animes i want to watch. like My Hero Academia and Attack on Titan. I watched the first seasons of these but now i'm waiting and will them all over again.

same with Demon Slayer and Shield Hero. 

SO MANY animes will start and literally never finish. There are so many 1-3 season shows that just stop without a proper end. There's literally no point in watching them. It really sucks. no I don't want to read about what happens next.

then occassionally some will end up getting a new season after 5-15 freaking years...and then end on a cliffhanger again.

Some will have over 100 episodes and and just stop without a proper end. It's annoying as hell. Same with old shows that ended in the 90's. Sliders just stops and ends on a horrible cliff hanger. Moeisha ends with her little brother being kidnapped by lil Kim or something and it's never concluded.

There should be a law that canceled and airing shows should be allowed to have at the very least 5 episodes to try and conclude. And if it's canceled after a season is over, they get 10 episodes."
Skin Decision: Before and After,Very few shows do I watch week by week. Mostly I wait for the season to end and watch at my leisure. Because screw cliffhangers and waiting for a show.
Skin Decision: Before and After,Yep. Stopped watching plenty in the middle of a season because it was cancelled. Not worth it to me and it’s a dumb thing to include in if you continue to produce a show.
Skin Decision: Before and After,"I’m the same way when it comes to books in a series. Thank you, George RR Martin and Patrick Rothfuss."
Skin Decision: Before and After,"Same behavior here.  I usually wait until the next season starts before I'll watch the previous season.  Some days, I want to watch a couple of episodes.

When it gets canceled, I end up losing interest."
Skin Decision: Before and After,"For me, if I have to wait a whole week for the next episode it increases the chances that I may not get around to watching it. And if I miss a week, I probably won't bother to watch anymore. I have to REALLY be into a show to schedule time to watch it, and I can't think of more than two or three shows in my whole life that I ever watched all of."
Skin Decision: Before and After,"Streaming services are just graveyards now for shows cancelled after 1/2 seasons, especially Netflix."
Skin Decision: Before and After,netflix in particular gave everyone severe trust issues
Skin Decision: Before and After,I just procrastinate and rewatch the same cartoons over and over again while I browse Reddit and tiktok.
Skin Decision: Before and After,This tracks with me. I'm no longer willing to commit my time to incomplete projects. I'll wait to hear whether or not the series was given a final season to close the story.
Skin Decision: Before and After,I definitely think twice about starting a show simply because so many get cancelled...so many good ones too.
Skin Decision: Before and After,I’m kinda leaning towards doing this because I’ve been burnt more than I’ve liked lately. I’ll still tune in for bigger shows that I know won’t be cancelled like House of the Dragon or TLOU.
Skin Decision: Before and After,"I've been doing this for ages.

If shows would actually wrap up a season I'd be willing to get into them while they are ongoing. Even if I'd like more, and there's some threads dangling, I could be OK with things mostly wrapped up at the end of the season. But no, the networks seem obsessed with cliffhanger endings. Which then go unresolved when the show is cancelled.

I stopped watching current shows as soon as the cliffhanger endings became common."
Skin Decision: Before and After,"I watch anime. True, many anime don't get a second season, and that's based on them being long ads for the manga/light novel source material."
Skin Decision: Before and After,"Duh, there is no reason to trust streaming services to finish a show, not even finish it well if they finish it at all. I’ll wait for years before watching a show I want to see. If almost everyone says it ends poorly I’ll just read all the plot points and skip watching it."
Skin Decision: Before and After,Only a quarter? Seems low.
Skin Decision: Before and After,"Its a shame that cancel rate isnt higher.  No one wants to read a book that doesnt have the last few chapters, and the message needs to be sent that series are no different."
Skin Decision: Before and After,Couldn’t agree more
Skin Decision: Before and After,Literally me. I want to know if the show has (or will have) closure before watching. This can be in the form of a conclusive season ending or guaranteed future seasons.
Skin Decision: Before and After,Dark Crystal was the last time I started a TV show when it aired. One of the vest series ever made and they cancelled it after only 1. I'll never forgive Netflix.
Skin Decision: Before and After,"In some countries TV series of 20 or more episodes are shot all at once and then aired, and the audience expect some closure at the end."
Skin Decision: Before and After,Of course. TV shows are now just long movies. I'm not going to start a movie if the end isn't available.
Skin Decision: Before and After,"I intuitively do the same and I was telling my wife this the other day. I rarely watch brand new shows. If I decide to watch a show, I make sure there is a season 2."
Skin Decision: Before and After,Here I am still waiting for final seasons to Raised by Wolves and GLOW.
Skin Decision: Before and After,I learned my lesson with American Gods. I can't even begin to tell you how many shows I will absolutely never watch because they got canceled.
Skin Decision: Before and After,"I do this. I'm not paying for a dozen streaming services every month. I wait until a season or series is finished, then grab the free trial or pay for the plan for a month. Watch everything worth watching. Cancel. Currently, I'm on my free 3 month trial for Apple TV that I wanted solely to watch Severance. I've watched it 3 times, it's so good."
Skin Decision: Before and After,"Not a new thing at all (HBO has axed lots of great series over the years. Deadwood, carnival etc) it is a more crowded playing field now so it is more obvious.  Having said that, Netflix has burnt me too many times to invest in a new series until after it is concluded."
Id like to Borrow a Girlfriend,"Got burned with Person of Interest? That was a fantastic show, much better than Swat.  I quit Swat this season,.there's only so many LA crime stories to tell.  I wished they kept Hondo in Mexico fighting cartels, that is a future gem of a spin-off"
Id like to Borrow a Girlfriend,">I got burned like a year ago with Persons of Interest...

Yes, because shows with complex characters and thought provoking stories should be avoided at all costs."
Id like to Borrow a Girlfriend,"SWAT is pretty good throughout, although it’s never more than undemanding watching.

I always thought that Persons of Interest was more of a tech/sci-fi show disguised as a weekly procedural - closer to Fringe than Law and Order - and I loved it for that."
Id like to Borrow a Girlfriend,SWAT is pretty formulaic but it's one of the better ones of that type.
Id like to Borrow a Girlfriend,I thought S1 was really good - and it has settled into a pretty decent show since then.
Id like to Borrow a Girlfriend,"Well, they mentioned they like the procedural nature of the shows way more than the overarching story where things actually matter. Rare thing to hear on Reddit, but procedurals are in general insanely popular, so no wonder really."
Id like to Borrow a Girlfriend,"Just because someone doesn't like a show you like doesn't mean they're against the very concept of good television.

""I'm not a big fan of salmon."" ""Oh, so you must eat only McRibs and are terrified of good flavor."""
Id like to Borrow a Girlfriend,"Yeah it was fine, but when they killed Carter something about the show felt off for me afterwards. It kind'v e turned into more of a hard sci-fi show with an overarching storyline, which it kind was beforehand, but it lost its procedural feel imo."
Id like to Borrow a Girlfriend,"Anyone preferring SWAT over PoI is expressing a preference for formulaic, bland, cookie cutter TV and sure that has it's place for when you want to turn your brain off. 

But which one is the better show? Anyone saying SWAT has no idea what they are talking about."
Id like to Borrow a Girlfriend,"Yes I hear you with regards to Carter, that killed me too, but it didn't ruin the show for me and is up there with some of my all time favourites. I've been going to try SWAT, but I mostly prefer a more serialised format, however sometimes procedural shows are good to have on in the background when you're doing other things. I did try Seal Team, and plan to give it another go, but I'm not sure that one is for me. I also love character driven shows whether they're more serialised or procedural and Person of Interest was definitely character driven."
Id like to Borrow a Girlfriend,">But which one is the better show?

It depends on the person, since everyone's parameters for ""better"" are different. That's how opinions work."
Id like to Borrow a Girlfriend,Everybody forgets about Daario. He pledged his life to Daenarys. Jon's gonna have 2 thousand Second Sons and an army of former slaves knocking at his door.
Id like to Borrow a Girlfriend,"I had a theory since I first heard about the Jon Snow spin-off that it should take place in Essos, that way you can get around having to have the original actors back, get new storyline opportunities, etc. 

But at the same time, there probably would have to be a confrontation between Jon and Grey Worm, the person who's trying to continue Dany's anti-slave crusade."
Id like to Borrow a Girlfriend,Wow! I had no idea that was the same actor. Hats off to Jacob Anderson — two great portrayals in a row.
Id like to Borrow a Girlfriend,"I had a theory that Drogon would bring Daenerys’ body back to Meereen where Daario and the Second Sons are keeping the peace, and after desperately spending days trying to find someone who could save her, he encounters that red priestess from season 6 who then brings Dany back to life. 

Of course that would mean that the Lord of Light would need her alive for a reason. That reason… well that’s as far as I’ve gotten."
Id like to Borrow a Girlfriend,"The whole idea of this spin-off is  sort of weird to me. Sort of... Pointless? In my head Jon fucking off with the Wildlings is the closest he'd ever get to a happy ending. People who treat him the same whether he is a bastard or a prince. 

If they're going through with it, I hope for as few legacy characters showing up as possible. Just Jon and Tormund dealing with their trauma and... I dunno. Wildling shit. Maybe parts of the Wildlings fracture back into their own clans. Maybe some seek to become a new King Beyond The Wall and there's drama. I wouldn't be opposed to Val showing up."
Id like to Borrow a Girlfriend,"When I started Interview with the Vampire, I knew I’d seen that face somewhere before but just couldn’t place it!"
Id like to Borrow a Girlfriend,"> It’s been a couple of months since the spinoff was announced by HBO, and now Anderson is weighing in on the prospect of appearing in the Harrington-led series. Anderson’s Grey Worm is one of the few who survived the aftermath of the incineration of King’s Landing, and as such, he could appear in the series. However, while speaking to E! News on the prospect of a return, Anderson remarks that he’d be shocked should such transpire. Given the way the relationship ended between the two characters, Anderson believes Grey Worm would only return to kill the White Wolf.

> ""I think it would be pretty tense if he did [appear in the new spinoff with Jon Snow]. I think the only way Grey Worm would show up in that show is to kill Jon Snow. I don’t think Grey Worm would want to see him again. I think that was quite a significant condition of [Jon] living, was like, 'I don't ever want to see your face again. I'm going to go my way, and you’re going to go your way, and that's that.' I'd be very surprised if we saw Grey Worm again."""
Id like to Borrow a Girlfriend,Jacob is absolutely killing it - literally and figuratively - on the new Interview with the Vampire adaptation. Can’t wait to see what season 2 has in store for him.
Id like to Borrow a Girlfriend,"They really need to offer this guy a shit ton of money give him a good plot to work with. 

I really think this show has a chance of working if they just focus on ""fixing"" S8 without hating on it."
Id like to Borrow a Girlfriend,I think he’ll be busy in the Anne Rice universe for a while lol
Id like to Borrow a Girlfriend,Man slayed it in Interview with the Vampire
Id like to Borrow a Girlfriend,"Oh man I knew the guy in Interview With the Vampire was familiar. I didn't realize he was Grey Worm.

He's spectacular in Interview."
Id like to Borrow a Girlfriend,[deleted]
Id like to Borrow a Girlfriend,"He's spectacular in Interview With A Vampire. Grey Worm was kinda neat, but it would be a bit of a downgrade in terms of what he'd be asked to do as a performer."
Id like to Borrow a Girlfriend,I make joke
Id like to Borrow a Girlfriend,"Honestly, I would love it if HBO did the fall of Valyria and Aegon taking over Westeros. That would be an amazing show if it was done right."
Id like to Borrow a Girlfriend,"Honestly, some characters are meant to go separate ways. That’s just the way it happens. The end of the series signified that when they both went their paths forward. He was a great part of the GoT series, but maybe he’s just meant to be just that, and leave it be. There’s much you can do with Snow moving forward…let what happened remain a part of his iconic past."
Id like to Borrow a Girlfriend,This show is a bad idea.
Id like to Borrow a Girlfriend,Grey Worm is dead. D&D forgot about the poisonous butterflies.
Id like to Borrow a Girlfriend,"I can't for the ""jon snow knows nothing"" sitcom"
Id like to Borrow a Girlfriend,Guy doesn’t make it out of Blackwater Bay because Unsullied know bupkiss about sailing. They go down a day underway if that and that’s the end of Grey Worm.
Id like to Borrow a Girlfriend,The Jon Snow show makes no sense to me. A spinoff of the main character?
Id like to Borrow a Girlfriend,"I also think it's crazy from the table read of the finale, other than every major actor being visibly distraught and upset at how the story was planned to end, the show was originally supposed to end like immediately after Jon kills Dany. No story about who becomes King, or how everyone goes their own ways, or how Jon is able to escape. It was supposed to just cut to black after the surprise death. 

Very interested to see how they spin off that ending. If Daario/Grey Worm put their differences aside to go after Jon Snow, that could make for some absolutely insane battle sequences and tension."
Id like to Borrow a Girlfriend,"This whole concept makes no sense to me. They are killing it with HotD and have managed to retrench a lot of the goodwill they lost with the dumpster fire of later Game of Thrones....and yet theyre planning to double down with a fucking Jon Snow spinoff.

Something no one asked for which makes no sense and is completely unbound from the plot or prospective plot of the books. 

Jon's ruined story is finished. If they want more GOT content they should look to a Dunk and Egg series or pad out the lesser seen aspects of the world in alternative media (e.g games, comics, short stories) before they go irrevocably smearing shit on the wall of the franchise."
Id like to Borrow a Girlfriend,Jacob is absolutely killing it - literally and figuratively - on the new Interview with the Vampire adaptation. Can’t wait to see what season 2 has in store for him.
Id like to Borrow a Girlfriend,Can we get an Arya spinoff instead? I want to see her continuing adventures!
Id like to Borrow a Girlfriend,Greyworm died a few days after he arrived at naath though
Id like to Borrow a Girlfriend,"Why are people acting like this Snow show is certain?  It's just in development, I really doubt it'll get a green light.  I know some click-bait sites have said it's going ahead and starting filming this December, but that's 100% bullshit, and honestly your own fault if you believe click-bait at this point.   I'd put money on it not ever happening, if I had any money."
Id like to Borrow a Girlfriend,Grey Worm should've been king. Waste of a plot.
Id like to Borrow a Girlfriend,They could have a cop buddy show with Jon Snow + Grey Worm travelling to bravos to solve a mystery
Id like to Borrow a Girlfriend,Gotta say I'm really tired of all these prequels and spinoffs. Make a new complete show instead of milking shit.
Id like to Borrow a Girlfriend,"I'm very interested in the world outside of Westeros tbh. HotD is great, but it'd be cool to see stuff set in Essos or the lands West of Westeros, or in the North thousands of years ago, or in Valyria before and/or leading up to the Doom"
Id like to Borrow a Girlfriend,"The only way I could see him return, is if Jon return to Westeros and Grey Worm somehow heard about it, making him come back to want revenge. Outside, of that I don't see any other reason why he would come back. I feel like a better solution would be to just a make another sequel spin-off, this one focused on Daario and Grey Worm."
Id like to Borrow a Girlfriend,"So would I

/thread"
Id like to Borrow a Girlfriend,How about a season where you watch ghost grass grow until it covers the whole world
Id like to Borrow a Girlfriend,What an odd name for a Jon snow spin off series.
Id like to Borrow a Girlfriend,I really hope the Jon snow show is made because I am super curious how they squeeze a story out of that dead end. It would be fascinating
Id like to Borrow a Girlfriend,"Greyworm, the absolute dullest character from the series. We don’t need more Greyworm"
Id like to Borrow a Girlfriend,"I don't think anyone gives a damn about that eunuch, Anderson"
Id like to Borrow a Girlfriend,They would find a way to shoehorn the character in somehow.
Id like to Borrow a Girlfriend,"Please, I hope this show dies in pre-production."
Id like to Borrow a Girlfriend,"Good, he sucked"
Id like to Borrow a Girlfriend,please no
Id like to Borrow a Girlfriend,He is sullied now 😂😂
Id like to Borrow a Girlfriend,"Man being Daario would suuuck. Left to rule a city he doesn’t really care about, finds out his Queen and the woman he loved died and the dragons all his enemies were afraid of are either dead or just fucked off somewhere forever. Mereen would become a shit show again real quick"
Id like to Borrow a Girlfriend,Daario uuuuuh kind of forgot about Daenarys. -D and D
Id like to Borrow a Girlfriend,"My memory isn't the greatest, but I believe that in the books Daario didn't really care about Danaerys, he was just a seductive opportunist. At least thats the impression I got."
Id like to Borrow a Girlfriend,Wasn't he ousted immediately? I'm assuming the slave owners killed him
Id like to Borrow a Girlfriend,Jon is north of the wall. How could you get him to Essos and have it make any sense whatsoever?
Id like to Borrow a Girlfriend,"My theory is that maybe Jon Snow's resurrection prevents him from aging traditionally -- to me, the most interesting place the spinoff could take place is hundreds of years in the future, as far removed from the show as possible


Plus it would be nice symmetry to have one spinoff hundreds of years prior and one hundreds of years afterward, both far enough away from the main series that they can toe the line between book and show canon"
Id like to Borrow a Girlfriend,"Grey Worm's pretty small time, though, since his stated goal is to sail to Naath and protect it from slavers. Jon wouldn't have any reason to go there.

(Y'all don't @ me about poison butterflies which clearly don't exist in the show's canon.)"
Id like to Borrow a Girlfriend,"I personally want the Jon Snow spin-off to be about the Night King and the Others; explore how they came to be, who the Night King was, what did those markings they made with bodies mean? 
Include some the Children of the forest lore, the giants and the First men's past, and how to stop another long night from ever happening again.

Let Jon Snow finally become the Prince that was promised.

But maybe that's a bit too fantasy for GoT."
Id like to Borrow a Girlfriend,"I mean it doesn't make sense that Jon goes into exile because of Grey worm anyways especially that Grey worm is leaving for naath. Like when he sails away they can be like okay man, come on back."
Id like to Borrow a Girlfriend,Bringing back old characters is usually good for ratings I expect we see all who survived.
Id like to Borrow a Girlfriend,"My own theory is Drogon returns to Essos, un-petrifies more dragon eggs to bring them back from extinction, and a dragon cult forms to worship them. The dragon cult raids slaver cities to offer sacrifices to the dragons, particularly Drogon."
Id like to Borrow a Girlfriend,"Based on rumors + HOTD mentioning the Song of Ice and Fire a bunch of times, I’m thinking it’s likely that the White Walkers aren’t gone, and the Red Priestesses will bring Dany back to help fight them once again. Basically taking a second swing at that whole storyline without doing a hard remake. I feel like this show will basically be GOT continued minus the Lannisters and Kings Landing characters."
Id like to Borrow a Girlfriend,"i just kinda hope they go the route of Andor. just a high-stakes drama loosely based in the GoT world. fuck the classic narrative, let John get captured by Giants for half a season and then find a new love interest that teaches him how to snowboard like the Northern most Northerners ancestors used to do.

extra super bonus points if Danaerys, Lannisters, dragons, white walkers and thrones are never even mentioned the entire series' run."
Id like to Borrow a Girlfriend,I like to think that Drogon brings Dany to Valyria where she gets revived. In Valyria there is a small colony of Valyrians that wishes to stay hidden and teaches her about the doom of valyria which was basically a lot of Valyrian going crazy and killing everyone and everything.
Id like to Borrow a Girlfriend,"> Of course that would mean that the Lord of Light would need her alive for a reason.

The sociopathic, all-knowing man-god currently ruling Westeros who broke her mind during The Bells leading to the slaughter of King's Landing so he could get power."
Id like to Borrow a Girlfriend,"> red priestess from season 6 who then brings Dany back to life

The only issue with this is that Emilia Clarke has stated in interviews that she is done with the franchise. Now, $$$ talks and I'm sure if they threw piles of cash at her then she would come back.

But if we are to take her at her word, she won't be returning in any capacity. Besides, I think HBO wants to remove itself from bringing back too many main characters from the original show."
Id like to Borrow a Girlfriend,"I think it’s weird because even though Game of Thrones was a massive ensemble series, it can be (IMO) argued that Jon is the main character of the series if you had to choose one character. He even gets the final scene of the show.

So it’s a bit weird that there’s a sequel spin-off starring the main character."
Id like to Borrow a Girlfriend,"I think they're going to try and retcon the white walker story line and have it continue beyond the wall so the Price who was Promised prophecy isn't meaningless. 

They've really been bigging it up in HOTD, which is weird to do to something that actually alienated a lot of the fanbase, unless you're going to do something with it"
Id like to Borrow a Girlfriend,"Oh it's pretty straight forward, Game of Thrones is getting a Franchise Expansion TM that everything else is getting. Jon is a popular character so naturally they landed on giving him his own show before ever coming up with a premise (note that every other Game of Thrones spin-off cancelled or still in development actually had some premise while this one is just the Jon Snow show).

I may sound cynical but I do trust HBO to make this show worth it.

Edit: wasn't aware that Kit Harrington actually pitched the show."
Id like to Borrow a Girlfriend,"_Wildling Shit_, the new sitcom on HBO that follows the silly hi-jinx of Jon Snow and Tormund."
Id like to Borrow a Girlfriend,"My theory is there are gonna do a like "" ohhh the nights king wasn't actually the king but was a general and the walkers are back"" and then go and do the walkers proper justice! You can kinda see that in HOTD they are alluding too them and I think they want to fix what is probably the biggest disappointment in the entire show! Just a theory though"
Id like to Borrow a Girlfriend,Jon's character is interesting because he's Aegon. If he's not gonna pursue that lineage and what comes with it then there's no show. A spin off of what.
Id like to Borrow a Girlfriend,Your version sounds absolutely awful
Id like to Borrow a Girlfriend,I actually liked the ending of the show and I also don't think a Jon Snow spinoff makes any sense. Everyone he ever loved is dead or is not going to be with him north of the wall. What's even up there for him to do for a whole series? A spinoff focusing on Arya would've made the most sense.
Id like to Borrow a Girlfriend,I think him trying to organize north of the wall would make an interesting story.
Id like to Borrow a Girlfriend,">The whole idea of this spin-off is sort of weird to me. Sort of... Pointless? In my head Jon fucking off with the Wildlings is the closest he'd ever get to a happy ending.

I agree. When i heard the talks about a Jon Snow sequel were getting serious i failed to think of a single direction it could go in... and I have a robust imagination. Unless they've somehow come up with a compelling storyline nobody has thought of, it feels very forced and not worth the risk of further tarnishing the legacy of the original series."
Id like to Borrow a Girlfriend,"It's a very natural step if you want to launch any kinds of Westeros based sequels.  If things down south go to hell in a handbasket - you know because they have a sociopath king, a hand with a penchant for diabolically dumb decisions, a sellsword as treasurer, and a completely untrained maester - they could come calling on Jon at some point.  even if he ""doen whan i""."
Id like to Borrow a Girlfriend,"> The whole idea of this spin-off is sort of weird to me. Sort of... Pointless?

Kit himself brought the idea up to George and HBO. And, according to Emilia, the show is essentially the brainchild of Kit and it's more or less being run by him.

Who knows how much of that will end up being true, and I'm not $urpri$ed he wants to return to the universe that made him a global superstar, but I have hope that him having at least some control of the show will create a series that lives up to the idea of a GOT sequel."
Id like to Borrow a Girlfriend,I just watched the first episode and had no idea that was grey worm.
Id like to Borrow a Girlfriend,Is it Any good?
Id like to Borrow a Girlfriend,"> one of the few who survived the aftermath of the incineration of King’s Landing,

Few? Well over half the fucking cast survived to the finale!"
Id like to Borrow a Girlfriend,He was EXCELLENT in Interview. My wife and I watched it this weekend and I told her at the end of the first episode if he didn’t at least get an Emmy nod it’d be a damn shame
Id like to Borrow a Girlfriend,"I waited for all the episodes to come out before binging it and even though I heard only great things about it, the show still blew me away. 

Probably top 3 this year for me. What a surprise hit."
Id like to Borrow a Girlfriend,Sooo good!!
Id like to Borrow a Girlfriend,Everyone is absolutely stellar on Interview tbh.
Id like to Borrow a Girlfriend,"I never would have recognized him in Interview with the Vampire if it weren't for one interview where he was asked to compare his prestige tv experience on GOT vs IWTV. In fairness it's been years since game of thrones, and I think even longer since his role was of any prominence there. So cool to see him absolutely killing it in a main role."
Id like to Borrow a Girlfriend,"I think it could work if they just gave him something to work with. Turn it into a revenge story, or about Grey Worm climbing up in Essos as part of a plan by the Iron Bank to take over Westeros or something.  There is potential here."
Id like to Borrow a Girlfriend,"IDK if the butterflies were ever mentioned in the show, but yes, he'd be just about screwed if he went there in the books."
Id like to Borrow a Girlfriend,"I see it more as a redo of the final season. Less a spin-off and more of a continuation of the series. That ending was massively unsatisfying, maybe we can actually get a half-decent ending here."
Id like to Borrow a Girlfriend,"No one asked for the Peacemaker TV series and yet ...

As long as they make it good, there shouldn't be an issue."
Id like to Borrow a Girlfriend,"Tbh I think something unbound from the plot of the books would be a decent way to go, since they wouldn't have to worry about the existing canon or people who might be mad about how they adapted it

As long as Benioff and Weiss aren't involved I would probably be interested"
Id like to Borrow a Girlfriend,"Shit I just watched the whole season and didn’t realize it was the same actor, he looks so different with hair.  He did a great job."
Id like to Borrow a Girlfriend,his best role was getting [beaten up by daniel kaluuya](https://youtu.be/gpXA6ox4F74?t=2m04s) for leaving mean youtube comments
Id like to Borrow a Girlfriend,"Given the success of HotD, I imagine HBO will be pretty quick to greenlight more spin-offs.  Maybe this one won't happen, but considering how eager Kit Harrington is to come back, I see no real reason it won't happen."
Id like to Borrow a Girlfriend,"are you from outer space? HOTD and GOT are still among the most watched shows worldwide, more spinoffs are but a matter of time, especially about someone like Snow, arguably the show's MC. Heck, if anything a Jon Snow serie has more reason to exist than HOTD considering Thrones' popularity"

The Business of Drugs,"Disney returns to being a for profit business instead of a throwing money into a furnace business.

The fact that they are announcing this now 5 days before there next financial statement means the 4th quarter of 2022 was really bad."
The Business of Drugs,Golden era of streaming is done. Now we're in shareholder wealth-accumulation mode.
The Business of Drugs,"> Walt Disney Co. is exploring more licensing of its films and television series to rival media outlets as pressure grows to curb the losses in its streaming TV business.


> **The Burbank, California-based entertainment giant is seeking to earn more cash from its content library, according to people familiar with the discussions who asked not to be identified as the talks are private. The move would represent a shift in strategy, as Disney has in recent years tried to keep much of its original programming exclusively on its Disney+ and Hulu streaming services.**


> A spokesperson for Disney declined to comment.


> **Disney is under pressure to improve its financial performance and change its streaming strategy. Last year, the company turned in its worst stock market results in decades. After Disney reported a $1.5 billion loss for its online video business in the third quarter**, the board fired Chief Executive Officer Bob Chapek, replacing him with Bob Iger, who had previously held that job for 15 years. Among his many challenges, Iger must also cope with a proxy fight by activist Nelson Peltz, who’s seeking a seat on Disney’s board and pushing for better performance...

> **Although Disney already licenses some titles to other platforms including Amazon.com Inc.’s Prime streaming service, it began to hoard content with the launch of Disney+ in 2019. Disney curtailed licensing of its own programs to third parties to boost that service. A deal that had Disney films running on Netflix Inc. was phased out,** and the company touted how much of its new programming came from its own in-house studios. 


> Wall Street cheered at the time because it meant the company was entirely focused on building out the streaming business. **The shift was costly, however, as Disney surrendered billions of dollars from home video sales and licensing deals with other networks.**"
The Business of Drugs,"We all joked that everyone and their brother starting their own ""XYZ+"" streaming service was heralding the end to the golden age of streaming, but man oh man, it really seems to be the case.  

I have really got to get more diligent with switching up my subs monthly/quarterly.  Up to now I have been too lazy to cut one service for a period of months since I knew I would eventually be back on it for whatever release I was looking forward to."
The Business of Drugs,"I don't think you'd necessarily see the main MCU and Star Wars stuff go elsewhere (at least not as first-run) simply because they are just so fundamental to the service, but I wouldn't be surprised whatsoever if you started seeing stuff from outside the franchises get shopped around and see some older MCU content get offered up for linear TV rights (while remaining on D+) and also see the window from first theatrical release to D+ release expand enough to allow for shopping rights to more places. 

Like, you might see Amazon or Roku pay to show old seasons of Mando or Loki with commercials. And you might see movies first have a longer run on a premium cable network before coming to D+."
The Business of Drugs,It's almost like balkanizing content into a dozen different streaming services was a bad idea or something.
The Business of Drugs,That’s a better reaction than upping the price.
The Business of Drugs,"Pumping out shit content disney doesn’t work guys

People want IP that works and tell good story that isn’t beating a horse to death for money"
The Business of Drugs,"DAE think that Disney+ is just a garbage streaming service, regardless of all the costs/losses mentioned in the article?  Fast forwarding is horrible, half the time it won't keep your place in the show you were watching if you come back to finish it the next day, navigating titles seems cumbersome and not user friendly, etc.  Comparing the functionality of Disney+ to Netflix is like night and day.  If they didn't have the IP they did, Disney+ would have died a month after rolling out."
The Business of Drugs,"Don't they already sell to other streamers?

ABC Studios made the Wilds on Amazon and 20th animation has a show on Apple"
The Business of Drugs,Or just slow down and start making good content again.
The Business of Drugs,"NBCUniversal ought to do the same. I love their back library on Peacock but it’s not enough to compete. An NBC type comedy series will be better suited for a bigger streamer, co-financed by the studio and the streamer. That way it won’t be as expensive for either party and will likely get a second season to grow."
The Business of Drugs,"I'm good with just a few services being available, like the old days. Give me Netflix, Hulu/Disney, Apple, Amazon(?) and HBO as my streaming service options. Everyone else (your Peacocks) will sign deals like in the old days where their content is hosted on one of those services. 

I'm also okay with less content. The days of throwing billions at shows & movies only to get 90% garbage to fill their libraries can die off ASAP imo. Give me the services that are closer to the HBO model. Make a handful of series and movies a year and their quality be increased due to the need for them to be successful. 

I don't need to live in a world where there are a billion shows to chose from. I'd be more than happy if streaming services were like HBO & HBO Max. Of course I wouldn't expect anyone besides HBO to give me HBO level quality but if they at least tried..."
The Business of Drugs,I'm beginning to feel like Netflix got their bad news out the way early last year
The Business of Drugs,I don't get how it can't be profitable with all their content.
The Business of Drugs,"That’s too bad, I enjoy Disney plus."
The Business of Drugs,"I mean sure, their non original Disney + stuff appears across multiple streaming platforms in Canada at least. They can still be the permanent home of their own content, but it's not gonna kill them to license shit like Avengers Endgame to Netflix for 6 months or something."
The Business of Drugs,"Hope they don’t end Disney+, it’s my favourite service. Futurama, the Simpsons, Scrubs, Bob’s Burgers, King of the Hill, I barely need anything else."
The Business of Drugs,"What the did to Willow was absolute vomit.  Obi Wan Kenobe, same thing.  Its a shame they allow such garbage to happen with all that budget."
The Business of Drugs,"I hope the majority of streaming services fail horribly and we go back to 2-3 major players. Not a monopoly, but not completely splintered. Prime will probably stick around because it's backed by Amazon, Netflix is still the biggest even after missteps and it'll probably stick around too. Until then, I'm just gonna sail the high seas, not gonna sub to more services."
The Business of Drugs,"My kids get mad at me (occasionally) when they want to watch Disney Plus, but I can’t see paying for a service that has so little fresh content. Prime doesn’t have the depth of Netflix, but at least they rotate their titles from time to time. 

Disney thought their stranglehold on their content would be a home run and it was when it debuted. Unfortunately there are many more innings to be played."
The Business of Drugs,"Have they tried making good shows?  Other than Andor and some of Wandavision, everything else is pretty mediocre."
The Business of Drugs,Here’s a tip Disney: make a couple half decent shows worth actually watching and then maybe you’ll gain some subscribers
The Business of Drugs,And here's my dumbass hoping for a WIllow season 2.
The Business of Drugs,Maybe they should focus on making more good content like Andor instead of churning out mediocre and bland Star Wars stuff.
The Business of Drugs,[deleted]
The Business of Drugs,netflix remains undefeated. the others will eventually close up shop too. netflix will be the last one standing
The Business of Drugs,Disney+ is for the kids and not for someone looking to stream new content every week. Their new content schedule SUCKS. They are lucky they packaged it with Hulu. Hulu without FX is nothing though.
The Business of Drugs,i hope they sell the hulu / fox content to amazon. after watching the expanse i bet amazon could bring another good alien movie.
The Business of Drugs,Fkin do it already.
The Business of Drugs,"Translation: sell off all the Non PC, Non Disney family appropriate franchises of value the company owns. Examples: Married with Children, Alien and In Living Color acquired with the Fox purchase."
The Business of Drugs,"I'm surprised Disney didn't sell off their non-animated and ""family friendly"" stuff that they got from Fox. Let Universal or Paramount buy the Fox shows, then maybe we'll finally get them on Blu-ray which is better than streaming anyway. :P"
The Business of Drugs,Can some reply in the comments with the article? You know paywall and all…
The Business of Drugs,"Is nobody at Disney able to do simple math?

Disney+ is good advertising for their brands, but it never will be a highly profitable part of the business, unless they start to charge some of the costs vs. their cinema movie profits."
The Business of Drugs,"It’s about the stories. Always has been. 










They need to find new stories."
The Business of Drugs,I can’t wait to watch Iron Fist on HBOMax and The Tales of Arkham Asylum on Disney+
The Business of Drugs,"Oh great, first HBO Max and now I'm also going to have to boycott Disney+ to send a message. Ugh, running out of streaming services here."
The Business of Drugs,I honestly wouldn’t mind if every last streaming service failed but one and everybody just threw their content up there.
The Business of Drugs,"Hmmmm ads during shows, giving content to other steamers, idk man sounds a lot like traditional network  and streaming model to me"
The Business of Drugs,Don't sell ESPN
The Business of Drugs,good sell off owl house
The Business of Drugs,"I mean, they kicked out Chapek and reinstated Iger for a reason."
The Business of Drugs,Losses for Q4 are predicted to be the peak and very similar to Q3 losses. This is not a surprise. They told Wall Street as much during the Q3 reporting before telling them this coming quarter would be the peak loss phase with losses reducing over 2023. That was the plan even before content licensing and content budget cuts just thanks to the subscriber base growth and the impact of late Q3/Q4 price increases at Disney+ and Hulu kicking in.
The Business of Drugs,Two streaming films should have gone to theaters
The Business of Drugs,"Netflix burned money for years. I think Disney expected success too soon, they could make it work if they want to."
The Business of Drugs,Who knew that spending 200 million for “she hulk: attorney at law” was a bad idea?
The Business of Drugs,good point. where do you keep up to date with a calendar of financial disclosures? I agree with you.
The Business of Drugs,Oh come on surely Disney always makes profit
The Business of Drugs,After the She-Hulk disaster I can see why.
The Business of Drugs,"It will be pure cable television by the end of the decade. Like you said, the disruption phase is over, now will come higher subscription costs, the end of password sharing, less content, certainly less original or risky content, contracts, ads (even in what was previously considered ad-free tier pricing), bundling....in time, streaming will be indistinguishable from cable."
The Business of Drugs,When was the golden age?
The Business of Drugs,"Check out YouTube tv. It’s better than Netflix ever was and no one ever talks about it. 

It has all the best shows from every service. Live tv and sports."
The Business of Drugs,"Peter, co Ceo of Netflix said last week that some of their competitors would resort to arms dealers again"
The Business of Drugs,Who was joking?
The Business of Drugs,Same here dude. I got a couple where I’m looking at them wondering why am I still paying for this one??
The Business of Drugs,"Going back to the high seas my dude, much simpler solution. Maybe keep your sub to that one streaming service you always go back to. We all have one"
The Business of Drugs,I think that they are going to sell either the Disney Channel stuff or stuff on Hulu.
The Business of Drugs,You know people are leaving cable right?
The Business of Drugs,"As long as I can still stream stuff on Disney+, I am happy. Just please Gosh don't let them go the scummy way of HBO Max..."
The Business of Drugs,I think it could be a good idea to sell some of their older quality stuff in general to other platforms. 5-10 year old movies like Zootopia or Coco for a couple of months on other services would create some disney buzz and make people longing for more.  And that would give them the means to create more own stuff too and grow with a healty bottom line. But it should be very measured. Never more than 5 of their movies on other plattforms at the same time. Disney plus must still have that exclusive feeling.
The Business of Drugs,"It's not that multiple streaming services can't work (it was inevitable that there would be multiple ones), it's that booming demand for content in the wake of the pandemic has died down and interest rates are high so massive content spending to inundate their currently-unprofitable services with content isn't as ideal. 

That being said there will clearly be losers in this race, with AMC+ and Peacock being the most likely candidates at the moment, so the herd will thin out a bit eventually."
The Business of Drugs,"The issue isn’t multiple streaming services the issue is debt is expensive right now so right now investors they don’t like the idea of them bleeding money to hit profitability (which was okay when debt was cheap); and to keep fox and other content exclusive to their service comes at a cost because they don’t own fully the copyright for a lot of movies and shows so it’s not cheap to have the shows on the service. Almost every streaming service is exceeding their own expectations. But right now nobody wants to be bleeding money or taking as much risk so making some extra money for now is a way to curb loses until they don’t need to anymore (when subs grow). Even for non-fox non-exclusive licensing is also an option that paramount+ for example does with Netflix. 

For new content, streamers like Netflix and Apple pay a premium upfront so that it’s essentially cheaper to have the content for life. Disney has generally always been super vertically integrated and fully owns most things they do. But Fox was like everybody else where ownership is all over the place so people need to get paid."
The Business of Drugs,"I've got 3, netflix, prime and Disney. Am I holding too many or what's the average?"
The Business of Drugs,"Frankly I'm considering just getting rid of Netflix, Disney+ 

Both seem to just lack content at this point."
The Business of Drugs,"How is it ""balkanizing""? A few companies wanted their own service so they decided to compete with each other simple as that."
The Business of Drugs,"Between Verizon and amex, I don't think I know anyone who pays full price for it."
The Business of Drugs,"As long as they don't remove it entirely from their own streaming app, like HBOMax has been doing to save pennies"
The Business of Drugs,100%. Every single tv show theyve produced has been hot garbage and then they wonder why they’re losing money
The Business of Drugs,Well they are enforcing the no password sharing aspect of the business now and people are not happy about that.
The Business of Drugs,"streaming just isn't super profitable because of the continued need for content, so the operating costs are pretty high. And Disney is spending a ton of money (or spent a ton of money) enough that Chapek insisted on hiding the costs from the board."
The Business of Drugs,Im confused they beat expectations (recently reporters on Forbes-end of September). Last I heard they were doing great?
The Business of Drugs,"i don't have disney+ but what content do they have except star wars, mcu and animation? i genuinely haven't heard of anything else

and mcu is losing popularity i think because phase 4 was meh and for most people their mcu journey ended with endgame, i am kinda in that boat as well, i don't care that much if i watch their new stuff anymore, it's like a bj that continues even after you finish"
The Business of Drugs,"servers cost a shitton of money to maintain, also, all those shows cost money to produce.

essentially if costs of content+servers+licensing of other rights > the money of all the subs, it's not worth it."
The Business of Drugs,"What content does Disney have exactly?

Outside of the Disney Princess shit it is MCU and Star Wars crap. MCU and Star Wars are both waning.  

Disney is trapped by its branding. The little kiddos put the Disney Princess shit on constant repeat, outside of that the target audiences of Disney will not tolerate anything else."
The Business of Drugs,"A lot of their subscribers are in cheaper areas.

20usd for 1 year in india for example, they are not making as much as their subscriber count makes it appear.

They also gave free subs and very discounted ones other places."
The Business of Drugs,"Considering The Simpsons is regularly the most streamed thing on Disney+ each month, getting some of that Fox content was clearly in their best interest."
The Business of Drugs,Wasn't Chapek notoriously bean-county?
The Business of Drugs,They hope the losses decrease over 2023.  It's a hope not a guarantee as companies are wrong with their future predictions all the time.
The Business of Drugs,Encanto would’ve set records
The Business of Drugs,That show was one of the better marvel shows.
The Business of Drugs,"Lmao I’ve never gotten frostbite from a take before, but I’ve never seen one this cold"
The Business of Drugs,I mean I enjoyed that show but it cost HOW MUCH?!?!?!?!!
The Business of Drugs,"It was a good show, probably not actually that expensive at all, but why put a sitcom on a streamer for…essentially free, and not ABC where you get ad money?"
The Business of Drugs,Just google search 'company name investor relations'.
The Business of Drugs,"Except. 

Now you bring your own infrastructure and any signal issues become your problem and not theirs."
The Business of Drugs,Good thing we still have pirating
The Business of Drugs,We might actually see the rise of TVOD again or even physical media.
The Business of Drugs,Im gonna mark it back when streamers were ordering series as opposed to cancelling their orders.
The Business of Drugs,"IMO, the great promise of streaming was that you'd get to watch any of a studio's IP whenever you wanted. They essentially killed the home video market with that idea. Now that they've decided it's more beneficial for the bottom line to disappear unprofitable content, that trend will continue and you'll get less and less for your money and niche shows will just stop being made."
The Business of Drugs,"2011 - 2019 when Netflix was the only big player in the streaming market worldwide. 

One ~~ring~~ service to rule them all!"
The Business of Drugs,When Netflix was free with a DVD subscription
The Business of Drugs,When Netflix has everything and you could just get by with a single sub
The Business of Drugs,"Three stages 

1. Market acquisition - companies give us the benefits in order to sign up
2. Supplier acquisition - companies give more benefits to the suppliers as competition in the space heats up and you need content to keep the market share, but this has now gotten more expensive. see Netflix spending big on friends and Adam sandler or Rian Johnson.
3. Shareholder value - now they claw back all the benefits we got and the vendors too to pay the shareholders"
The Business of Drugs,When you could get $100 of content for $10.
The Business of Drugs,When a show being a Netflix original meant something.
The Business of Drugs,2013-2023
The Business of Drugs,"I’m so out of practice on my sailing, all of this BS from the different companies is making me want to relearn for sure"
The Business of Drugs,"The kids content is literally the only reason I have a sub at all, and I suspect a lot of other parents as well."
The Business of Drugs,There still is money to be made from the few who aren't
The Business of Drugs,Yet it’s still far more profitable than streaming far more.
