Durarara!!,"Well, get ready because this season is only getting better from here. I definitely was NOT prepared for what's to come."
Durarara!!,"Thanks for reminding me OP, forgot the new season came out!

Thrones was meh, but Ive got Jojo's on fridays(which has been phenomenal) and Ill def start catching up on AOT today"
Durarara!!,"It’s insanely fantastic. Has a perfect 10 score on IMDB. Season 2 was epic, but this raised the bar. Way less flashbacks too which helps."
Durarara!!,"To me, it's the best airing show right now. Every episode of this show is fantastic, but yesterdays was perfect. To have 54 episodes of buildup to yesterdays episode, and pull it off like that is amazing."
Durarara!!,[deleted]
Durarara!!,[deleted]
Durarara!!,100% agree. It's been absolutely amazing.
Durarara!!,"If anyone wants to get caught up on this season, I have 3 48 hour Crunchyroll guest passes. I do not get anything for handing these out, I don't work for CR, etc, etc

http://www.crunchyroll.com/guest_pass?code=NEWVES8GQ4Y

Durarara!!,"I’d love to see the guys that made *Castlevania* adapt *Berserk* as an animated series for Netflix.

Rereading that manga is filling the *GoT*-sized disappointment in my heart."
Durarara!!,[deleted]
Durarara!!,"I’m reading the manga, and trust me it’s going to get so much more awesome from here."
Durarara!!,"I saw the first season a while back. But aside from that have never really watched anime. 
Where could I catch up on the newer seasons of this show?"
Durarara!!,"Manga reader here (no spoilers obv). Imho, from here on out the series is a 10/10 in regards to writing, specifically story composition.

As intriguing as his writing has been from the start, Isayama REALLY improved since the series began, and it shows."
Durarara!!,"Dude.. You are a saviour. I didn't know there was another season of Attack on Titan :)

Big thanks. I know what I'll be losing sleep over tonight :D"
Durarara!!,"And you still didn't see shit.
If they ever make a S4, the series just straight up change completely and in a better way.

As I said, this isn't ANYTHING."
Durarara!!,"So glad this is getting the recognition it deserves. Since it’s an anime I feel like it’s kind of trapped out of its potential...but it’s writing is phenomenal compared to ANY genre. The mystery, build up, battle strategies, character conflicts, music, artwork, animation, lore....& even the pay off so far in the manga has been fantastic. One of the only shows where the mystery actually delivers. Thankful it doesn’t do a lot of anime cliches (aside from internal monologues, but I enjoy it). I remember the show used to get criticized for things “just happening”....but the beauty of it is EVERY thing eventually connects. If season 4 ever airs, people will be shocked at how deep the story gets."
Durarara!!,is the new episode out?
Durarara!!,so season 4 (ahh seems part 2 of season 3) is out? source? dubbed? When can we expect the dubbed version? I really enjoyed all the episodes so far. very very good series.
Durarara!!,"Absolutely. The last few episodes have been tight, with smooth animation and a return to the grit that AoT first slapped us across the face with in the beginning."
Durarara!!,"Tbg I agree. 

I really didn't care for AoT season 1, but it's only been up from there"
Durarara!!,"I'm holding myself back for reading the Manga. I just watched season 2 and caught upt to 3 last week. I forgot how the show is surrounded with political conflict and hunger of power, which I love.
Season 3 reminded me of Fullmetal alchemist with all the *SPOILER* insurrection and taking out the monarchy set up at the moment *SPOILER*, but yeah, comparing it to Fullmetal is just praising it too much and the show isn't there yet.
While I keep hearing that the show is overrated and often slow, the animation is great (just remind yourself when Levi is attacked in the roof by Kenny) and slow... Yeah, it's slow, but that is how a political matter develops, and it's awesome. I just loved so much when Erwin was plotting stuff.

Ok, I finally got the chance to said some stuff since I don't have enyone to talk to about it...
If you are reading this, know that the show is a above average and beyond decent political thriller with Titans as an excuse to move a lot of the plot points, the show isn't slow if you manage to theorize along with the characters and just alone, the animation saves most of the time what ever complain you might have.
I even checked the Manga and the drawings became so much better since the first Time I read it.

Go watch if, if not, go Watch, Fullmetal Alchemist brotherhood, please."
Durarara!!,"Just curious, does the anime follow the manga really well? The manga is pretty great. It's quite the wild ride, and I would love to watch it animated. I don't want to watch the anime to be disappointed if it doesn't closely follow the manga."
Durarara!!,The most recent episode is the highest rated episode on imdb.
Durarara!!,**And this is only episode 5.**
Durarara!!,"I started rewatching the first season last night, never got beyond it back in 2013. I'm looking forward to catching up."
Durarara!!,"Attack on Titan has got to be one of the best series i've ever watched

imo, i really think its story, character, plot, world-building, visuals and art direction easily sits in the leagues of  the best tv shows out there like breaking bad and GoT (s1 - 4)

the shame with anime i find is that it is often taken less seriously than live action and less accessible due to the language barrier and certain tropes used in anime. 

because if not for that, i would not be surprised if it would be capable of being massive cultural phenomenons such as GoT and BB"
Durarara!!,Glad to hear this! I watched the first two seasons and adored it. I was surprised how much I liked it as I could never imagine taking anime so seriously. I didn't enjoy the third season at the beginning and dropped off. I will try it again. I definitely see this series as GOT like and I need something to fill that aching gap.
Durarara!!,A good example of an Anime that doesn't get caught up in the pitfalls of filler and horrible pacing.
Durarara!!,"It truly is one of best shows running right now, the last two episodes really upped the ante. I understand for a lot of people, anime isn't there thing, but they should definitely give AOT a try, it's definitely some of the best ones out there."
Durarara!!,"As much hype this anime getting, as a manga reader only for this show, this sub will go in a meltdown what I found out in the story. And I cant wait for that day even tho it will be annoying. Im actually surprised the Anime hasnt reached that far yet in the story its been like 4 years or something now. I havent spoiled anything other than hyping the direction of the story."
Durarara!!,"I completely agree, first anime I have ever watched too!"
Durarara!!,"It really shows the true potential of anime, when they don't focus on creepy fanservice and cliche stories."
Durarara!!,"Is the dub out/being simulcast on Funimation yet? Down to pay for it, obviously. I’m caught up on the manga but I started with the dubbed anime on Netflix and find it jarring to revert to another language’s voice actors."
Durarara!!,What’s AoT like?
Durarara!!,"As someone who quit back when there was so much filler that a single chase scene through a forest lasted several episodes, is it really worth going back?"
Durarara!!,Attack on Titan and OnePunch Man are the two things helping wash out the bitter taste that was Game of Thrones Season 8.
Durarara!!,I stopped after season 1 ended because as far as I'm concerned the plot being driven by cringy motivational speeches is completely unwatchable. Have they done away with that and gotten back to good old fashioned Kronenberg style horror?
Durarara!!,How does it stack up to S1?
Durarara!!,is the show true to the manga? also which chapter would season 3 part 1 be in the manga?
Durarara!!,This season has been so much better then last season. It's gotten back to what the anime so great in S1.
Durarara!!,"This is just my feeling on AoT. I'm glad you're enjoying the latest season!

I kept up with the manga till about volume 25? And got bored. It just wasn't my cup of tea anymore. I like a story with ending in sight and I just have no hope AoT will finish anytime soon. I don't even want to invest time watching the anime cos I'm so tired of the world now..."
Durarara!!,"Manga reader here, can confirm the story just keeps getting better from here"
Durarara!!,"You're being overly generous to GoT. There's a huge gulf between ""wasn't perfect"" and the flaming clown orgy shitshow we received."
Durarara!!,"I enjoyed this show until they spent 3 episodes or so monologuing about what they are going to do about soldiers rotating a cannon towards them. This was the moment when I remembered I don't like anime and why I don't like it.

&#x200B;

I have a suspicion that years later they still rotate this damn cannon."
Durarara!!,Could never get through season 1. Tried twice and just always stopped around episode 12/13. Is it worth it to keep pushing through it?
Durarara!!,meanwhile s2 one punch man is absolute pish :(
Durarara!!,Yeah the manga art isn’t the best in the world but he really has a knack for world building and storytelling
Durarara!!,On Netflix?
Durarara!!,"I've not kept up with any of it past the first 2 or 3 episodes when it first came out.

But I'm curious how it holds up against Mob Psychos second season for reference, which is my anime of the year."
Durarara!!,Where can I watch it?
Durarara!!,"Dude, I haven’t even seen season 2. The wait just killed my hype. Guess I’ll have to get back into it..."
Durarara!!,I read the manga but haven't been watching the series. Where is it up to?
Durarara!!,"I've read somewhere that this might be the last season anime adaptation for some reason? Please tell me this is false news? And please don't spoil Season 3B for me, I'm saving it to binge-watch it. Are those rumors true?"
Durarara!!,What arc is it in atm? The beast titan stuff? cuz i dropped the manga shortly after.
Durarara!!,"I read a bit ahead in the Manga after season 1, and I felt like they never really addressed a problem I saw. They never seemed to run out of soldiers and bodies to throw at problems. I thought the show made a point early on to point out how so few signed up to be a scout, but there's so many of them, so many of them die, and they never seem to run low on scouts. I don't get it."
Durarara!!,"Okay I guess Ill give it another go. I really didn't enjoy season 2 that much
It felt so flat at the beginning and was just mostly royalty intrigues. All I wanted to know was about the damn basement lol"
Durarara!!,"I couldn't wait for episode 17.. so I read all the manga.. but I still enjoyed the episode.

Next weeks is going to be very intense. I cant wait."
Durarara!!,"It's technically part two of season 3. And from what I saw, unless this was an old article and I missed the date on it, it's switch to Wednesdays instead of Sundays. However, if Hero is the newest one you've seen, I'm pretty sure the one after that is gonna have some pretty ""huge"" developments 😏 2 episodes after Hero at the most"
Durarara!!,"I'm just starting it now, now that the Dub is on a weekly schedule. Loved the first episode.

Just tell me one thing, though: Did they CGI the Colossal again?"

Durarara!!,"I kind of liked it better before some of the answers got revealed and a certain commander died. Besides that, the action is as it should be and it is incredible tv."
Durarara!!,I seem like the odd person out but I thought the first season sucked
Durarara!!,"I like the show and understand why everyone cries and whines but is their a condensed fan edit out that skips all the rehashing, reduces crying, and skips intro/credits?"
Durarara!!,"I personally dont agree but thats why there are so many options and opinipms. I feel like in the last 3 years there have been so many good anime that i typically forget that attack on titan is a show to watch even. Made In Abyss blew me away, devilman crybaby was a fever dream exercise in how bizarre anime can get, a place further than the universe is an excellent example of story really being driven by the characters. As far as live action goes, chernobyl has been a master class in pacing, tone, and acting."
Durarara!!,"Only anime that I really care about anymore tbh. Wouldn't say its top tier television tho lol.

If they manage to adapt the current final arcs of the manga..man I really hope they can do those well.No spoilers but its such a great progression."
Durarara!!,I'm having trouble getting back into anime after years without. I started up My Hero Acadamia  (dubbed) on Hulu made it up to the intro.. I couldn't take it seriously.
Durarara!!,Can you all stop with the hyperbole
Durarara!!,AoT lost it's glory for me. I enjoyed the first season and I think the second but stopped caring after that.
Durarara!!,Ehhhhh
Durarara!!,"Season three has been a big improvement. Things actually happen now instead of characters just standing around having long internal monologues, or shouting all their lines."
Durarara!!,"Jesus, there can’t be a single appreciation post without shitting on GOT. It’s becoming sheep mentality."
Durarara!!,"Nothing I've seen from AoT (first two seasons) qualifies it as even the best show of that year. Unless there was some drastic changes in the animation quality, writing, pacing, directing, etc. then I feel as though this might be an over-exaggeration. But i'm happy that you're enjoying it."
Durarara!!,"AoT was the most \*tedious\* anime I've ever watched. I couldn't make it past the first season. The pacing was such a drag, and the melodrama and characters so cliche, I gave up. 

I feel like you have to have the processing power of a piece of toast to not get bored with AoT. 

Are you saying it gets WAY better?"
Durarara!!,The Rising of the Shield Hero has been pretty good too in my opinion.
Durarara!!,"Season 3 part one was soooooooooooo terrible.  I don't like a lot of Anime due to its reliance on a lot tropes, but AoT was good \*despite\* those same tropes like ""I don't believe in myself for no reason"", transformations for erryburdy!, and new power assigned at random.  


But season 3 part one was nothing \*but\* those tropes and makes me nervous enough about part two that I haven't started it yet."
Durarara!!,"And OF COURSE the current rumor is that this is the studio behind it in Studio WIT's last season running it....

&#x200B;

I'll be less concerned if the principal key directors and animators behind it can stay or if it more defaults into Production I.G. as Wit was kind of connected to them to begin with as a production but man oh man how Ironic would it be if all these GOT fans find this and start watching only for JC Staff to take over Season 4 and then close it out and it ends up like OPM S2.

As someone that watches a lot of anime, GOT ended BETTER than most anime ever do.  Same company and directors/actors/writers with a complete adaptation that ended relatively satisfactory while the quality declined in the end it wasn't unwatchable.

Most anime either never get that and you have to read the source material OR the source material never finishes either.

TL;DR: Game of Thrones was western media finally catching up to the pain anime fans have felt for over a decade now."
Durarara!!,/u/jdthemannis
Durarara!!,C'mon now. You guys need to watch more shows
Durarara!!,Are we going to acknowledge that the creator is literally a sympathizer for imperial Japan and publicly stated he believes Korean's to be subhuman? I know it sounds absurd but this true and public knowledge. When you look for it it's easy to find the imperialist allegories within the show. Some characters even have names of German generals from WW2.
Durarara!!,season 2 was a huge disapoint ..just finished season 3 part 1.. gonna binge the rest when it all comes out
Durarara!!,Warning: people saying attack on titan is more satisfying than season 8 of Game of Thrones is going to get a massive wake up call in the next episode.
Durarara!!,"Well, I don't agree, but this IS the internet, so here I am.  AoT blew me away when it first came out, so good, the opening theme so powerful, it's ability to surprise me week after week.  This latest season however, just hasn't done much for me yet.  Like what has happened?  Armin is too scared to act, Mikasa has said how many words?  Erin transformed and yells...  I am sure it will get better, I just have been underwhelmed so far this season.

If you are fresh off the end of GoT and still got your HBO sub, check out Chernobyl.  It's educational, dark, Erie, and just keeps you watching.  For a story you kind of know, you will want to watch them tell it."
Durarara!!,really? got bored it of it after the first 12 or so episodes.
Durarara!!,"AoT is the only anime I've watched since Pokemon as a young kid and I really tried to get into it. I just can't enjoy watching a powerpoint presentation for hours on end, I don't see the appeal."
Durarara!!,There's a reason why it's the top rated episode of any TV show ever on IMDb at the moment
Durarara!!,"Meh, I disagree. It has awesome moments (basically everything Levi) but so much is just annoying stupid anime bullshit. The way they try to build Armin as being the smart one because he is so useless, the way soldiers keep crying until some one throws absolutely meaningless motivational speeches at them and the way every scene gets stretched out because of random flashbacks or dialogues is just sooo annoying. The stuff that IS happening is amazing but their storytelling is such cliched anime nonsense it annoys me so much."
Durarara!!,is it just endless scenes of people doing the anime constipation scream?
Durarara!!,Its last*
Durarara!!,Had a friend tell me its so much better without all the normies screeching about it.
Durarara!!,[deleted]
Durarara!!,Add Dororo to that list if you want to scratch that same mildly-grimdark itch as AoT and Thrones
Durarara!!,You picked a good week to catch up.
Durarara!!,MUDAMUDAMUDAMUDAMUDAMUDA
Durarara!!,"Prepare for feels, were only halfway trough the 2nd part of season 3 and its already a bloody bloodbath"
Durarara!!,"I forgot too, and it sure is good"
Durarara!!,How's Part 5? I initially dropped it due to the animation quality going downhill episode by episode.
Durarara!!,The next couple of seasons will be immense too
Durarara!!,i agree OPM season 2 has been really disappointing so im glad theres something to look forward to in the anime world every week.
Durarara!!,"The scenes where camera follows characters flying in odm gear are easily one of the most breathtaking pieces of animation i've ever seen. I just can't wrap my mind around that how do they even do that shit, it's fucking insane."
Durarara!!,The ODM gear GoPro! I was so surprised yet impressed when I saw that
Madam Secretary,David boreanz cant be stopped.
Madam Secretary,The Bull renewal has me surprised after the Weatherly related settlement that came out earlier this year. I guess ratings were good enough to over look it.
Madam Secretary,My dad will be pleased.
Madam Secretary,madam secretary running for president awesome!
Madam Secretary,Im not above saying that I am happy that Swat is coming back. It is my guilty pleasure.
Madam Secretary,yay another season of SWAT
Madam Secretary,"Ahh, so this is what living in the time of peak TV means."
Madam Secretary,Also 60 Minutes & 48 Hours were renewed.
Madam Secretary,"McGuyver tho?

I mean I haven’t followed it all. I tried the first or second (maybe) episodes and it was just so silly I couldn’t bear it."
Madam Secretary,Yea for Madame Secretary. My favorite.
Madam Secretary,"I know people will poo, poo these shows. But these are my easy-going shows-especially in this world of crap news."
Madam Secretary,CBS basically only left The Code (The Red Line being a limited series) from dramas.
Madam Secretary,"Is Seal Team good? I really liked SIX on History, but it was sadly cancelled, so I have been looking for a new military show"
Madam Secretary,Wow.  Watched Hawaii Five-O for a couple of seasons before forgetting about it.  2 more seasons and it will match the original.
Madam Secretary,My parents approve.
Madam Secretary, madam secretary running for president awesome how they will use this as a prop against Trump 2020 and republicans I figured as much
Madam Secretary,"I’m so annoyed that The Bull is staying on television. I hate it when shitty people get rewarded. Yeah they had to pay Eliza and there was some negative press, including Spielberg pulling out, but still. Michael Weatherly is a shitty human being and shouldn’t get to be on air. He’s not even a great actor."
Madam Secretary,"CBS really is the home for old people and their mediocre ""dramas"". I can't think of a single show on that network that young people love and talk about."
Madam Secretary,Oooh still going for that old white demographic eh CBS...
Madam Secretary,The CBS bubble is kind this year.
Madam Secretary,"During the wage controversy it came out that Scott Caan makes as much as the other lead on Hawaii 50, but he doesn't appear in around eight episodes.  His dad is a producer and got him this deal."
Madam Secretary,"How is this shit getting renewed but Fox cancelled The Mick, Last Man on Earth, and Brooklyn Nine-Nine?"
Madam Secretary,"Wow, that’s a garbage lineup. I forgot what was on regular cable these days."
Madam Secretary,"Is anyone else slightly disturbed by the sheer audacity of the pro-military, pro-police propaganda on SWAT and Seal Team?"
Madam Secretary,They should’ve kept The Brave and canceled SEAL team
Madam Secretary,Need an Angel reunion bring back Spike.
Madam Secretary,Guy is a machine. Has basically been on TV since 1997 non stop.
Madam Secretary,"Apparently Michael Weatherly, too. Literally."
Madam Secretary,"It's also 3 seasons in with over 66 episodes shot.  Shows that hit that mark almost always get renewed because they will hit the magic 88 episodes needed for a syndication package the next session. And that's where the sweet, sweet profits are for the producers (also CBS in this case). Guess money talks...

Ditto for MacGyver BTW."
Madam Secretary,"Pretty much, the expected ratings drop after the allegations came out just didn’t happen."
Madam Secretary,Same with my Aunt.
Madam Secretary,"Yes, there are dozens of us!"
Madam Secretary,"First season was bad, then it actually became good, but now with George Eads leaving I'm not so sure anymore"
Madam Secretary,"I enjoy it for nostalgic reasons, and I like the lead. It has some cringe for sure, especially the boss lady. The rest of the cast can be fun, and the situations are usually somewhat interesting."
Madam Secretary,"Its garbage.  The writing is lazy. The token group casting is cringeworthy at best. I cant take the midg.... little lady.. small person.. ,whatever, boss lady seriously. 

I expected more from a great name like McGuyver."
Madam Secretary,"I love Hawaii 5-0 cause it’s pure a popcorn show. Sometimes, I just want to switch off and watch a stupid, predictable cop show with likeable characters."
Madam Secretary,sorry but I watch the first three episodes and it was crap.
Madam Secretary,"it's OK not great, just OK. In the past few episodes though they have be lucky to tag along with Marines and Army doing training exercises so they get to use the real equipment. For example they got onto an osprey and they saw a marine amphibious landing. There was a CGI'ed A-10 in one episode.

They also take on the VA full force, which kind of needs to happen. Once you are out the VA just screws with you and it was a subject in the last two episodes leading to a very surprising ending on a network like CBS show. They sure didn't gloss over that one.

&#x200B;

But of course the real reason I watch is because it has the doggie and his handler. That dog is such a good boy! Love it when they use him, he is totally the star of the show."
Madam Secretary,Personally I'd say it is worth a watch. If you're looking for something military related.
Madam Secretary,"Seal Team has the highest highs and lowest lows. Some really great episodes and story lines but also some utter crap ones. If you tolerated S2 of SIX (lets be honest, S1 was much better) then Seal Team is definitely worth a watch."
Madam Secretary,It's okay.  I liked last year's The Brave better.
Madam Secretary,I liked SIX far better than SEAL Team
Madam Secretary,"I stopped watching after Wo Fat got captured on that reality show episode. Then tuned in just to see what was up between him and Mama McGarrett. 

I'm happy for Alex O'Loughlin though. The dude is living the life."
Madam Secretary,"I'm young and i watch a lot of CBS shows, but i think i'm the exception haha"
Madam Secretary,"SWAt were we have a black team leader, a black police captian for SWAt and a female team member who is polyamorus, but unlike in other shows isn't just defined by that."
Madam Secretary,Because it's a different network?
Madam Secretary,"Different audiences, different rating expectations, different costs to produce."
Madam Secretary,CBS has always been a pro-military and pro-police channel. What would you like in it's place?
Madam Secretary,"I would love a limited revival series.

WB can even do a Buffy revival series featuring Angel and/or Spike."
Madam Secretary,I thought the magic number was 100? I guess that is just a half season more than 88...
Madam Secretary,Because the people who watch don’t care. And don’t follow twitter outrage mobs. And CBS doesn’t care about the outrage mob that didn’t watch the show to begin with.
Madam Secretary,"It hasn't been as bad as I thought it would be since George Eads left. 

Yea it sucks hes gone, but looking past that part of the story, it's still pretty good! The new recruit takes a bit of time to get use to, but as long as they keep bringing Murdoc back the show is a good mindless show to watch"
Madam Secretary,"Coincidentally, it started sucking when he left. Kind of like the obvious hole when Kate left."
Madam Secretary,Don’t pretend that you don’t know that word is horribly offensive
Madam Secretary,It's just not the same without  Daniel Dae Kim and Grace Park
Madam Secretary,"It seems 4 million people would agree with you, since it lost that many viewers from the first episode."
Madam Secretary,"Yeah I missed doggie in the last few episode, we need more doggie."
Madam Secretary,"I really enjoyed (don't have a better word, parts of them made me really uncomfortable) the recent episodes looking at how vets are treated once they come home damaged. It's something that needs to be higher in the public consciousness."
Madam Secretary,"You didn't like Season 2 of SIX? I know it was not as good as season 1, but i liked the story of the second season, too bad it kinda ended on a cliffhanger."
Madam Secretary,Nah I’m also young and I like cbs shows
Madam Secretary,All three characters preferred.
Madam Secretary,Yea it's been sliding back since the 90's and 88 is the standard now.
Madam Secretary,"And because MW played the beloved DiNozzo for over a decade. I've seen massive amounts of people defending him because ""he's a jokester!"" and ""he played Tony, this was obviously just another Tony kinda joke!"". Plus, CBS will renew any and everything."
Madam Secretary,*Show me on the doll where the internet hurt you*
Madam Secretary,"Honestly, I like Junior and Tani. While I liked the others, the show has been a bit fresher with the two new, younger cast members."
Madam Secretary,"A background actor? I'd expect this from a supporting actor, but a background actor? Big balls for an extra."
Madam Secretary,">The incident happened when the background actor cut into a craft services line in front of a waiting line of extras. Told by a female craft services employee to go to the back, the actor instead shoved her. That set off her husband, also a craft services worker, who threw the offender on the table and pummeled him, leaving him bloodied. He was taken to the local hospital by police for treatment. No arrests have been made.

IM KENNY POWERS MOTHER FUCKER. THE STAR OF THIS SHOW"
Madam Secretary,"> fight between  a background actor and a craft services employee left the actor bruised, battered, **and no doubt still hungry.**


Lmfao

Best part of the article"
Madam Secretary,"No cuts, no buts, no coconuts."

Madam Secretary,"Production rule #1: don’t fuck with crafties. You could be an asshole to everyone else on set, but nobody disrespects the people who handle the food. What a dumbass."
Madam Secretary,"""How do ya handle a hungry mmmaaaannnn??...., Manhandlers."
Madam Secretary,"Damn, just like real politics! The people with the least importance act like they're hot shit."
Madam Secretary,"“Now president of the United Stares”... Come on, how hard is it to proof read?"
Madam Secretary,">The incident happened when the background actor cut into a craft services line in front of a waiting line of extras. Told by a female craft services employee to go to the back, the actor instead shoved her. **That set off her husband, also a craft services worker**, who threw the offender on the table and pummeled him, leaving him bloodied.

You have fucked up now."
Madam Secretary,[deleted]
Madam Secretary,"Remember when that Dharma and Greg guy went nutso on the set of Criminal Minds while he was directing and episode. Incidentally was totally obsessed with mid-late '90s Tea Leoni and Jenna Elfman. I watched Naked Truth around the clock on ABC and NBC but I've paused a couple of Madam Secretary episodes early and never went back. It probably would have been a great spinoff to West Wing, though."
Madam Secretary,"Im pitching a new show,'How to kill a career in 5 seconds '"

Madam Secretary,"Pushing a female is a bitch move. Glad her husband smacked him. 

Background actors are bottom of the barrel. I was one!"
Madam Secretary,"In the last few months it's become our Sunday night wind down show.  It's the final season, and she's the President with a VP from the opposing party."
Madam Secretary,"Politics can be brutal sometimes.

But that's a gossip site, so who knows if the story is even true."
Madam Secretary,"I always thought this and that suffragette movie that came out around the time were stealth boosts for Hillary. / end conspiracy theory.

I liked the episode of supernatural where they ended up as production secretaries because no one cared."
Madam Secretary,"Of course they did not do a damn thing since it was a man.

Had it been a woman they would have arrested the person responsible within minutes of it happening."
Madam Secretary,"I've only seen about 1/2 an episode of this show, but I went to high school with the girl who plays the main characters daughter."
Madam Secretary,It was Ricky Gervais.
Madam Secretary,"They called him a background actor, but the people behind him in line extras, so maybe he was actually a supporting actor."
Madam Secretary,"So, the background actor got what he deserved"
Madam Secretary,I would say that’s catering not craft services... craft services is usually help your self.
Madam Secretary,"What? 
You’re not supposed to fuck with anybody on set. There’s no special rule for crafty.
Work rule #1: don’t fuck around at work."
Madam Secretary,next time just hit refresh to kill the timer instead of railing against modern society
Madam Secretary,"I don't think so.  The main character is blond and starts out as secretary of state, but the president that appoints her comes from a party with a bunch of climate change deniers, so he's clearly a Republican, and Clinton of course was in a Democratic cabinet.  And of course there's the CIA background."
Madam Secretary,I thought it was Kaitlin Olsen.
Madam Secretary,Practising another hosting gig?
Madam Secretary,I have a feeling the producer came by the hospital to make sure no charges were filed.
Madam Secretary,So satisfying.

Madam Secretary,Stupid bird
Unfair,"""...she was told GILLIGAN'S ISLAND was going to be her show.""

She could believe anything she wanted, but (1) four of the seven regulars had been in the pilot, and she was not; and, (2) she obviously didn't have star billing written into her contract. Bob Denver was very clear that he had choice of billing, and he leveraged that to improve the billing for Dawn Wells and Russell Johnson after the first season. There's also the common sense fact that the show was called. ""Gilligan's Island."" Louise was 30 when the show started, very experienced in movies, TV, and Broadway."
Unfair,"When you hear complaints about 'typecasting' what you're normally hearing about are actors who got lucky and didn't realize it.

Tina Louise is only a household name because of Gilligan's Island. She was not a major star, despite years in the industry and - especially for the times - on the downslope of her career. If she had never been in Gilligan's Island, you wouldn't even know who she was.

The fact that she wasn't a major star after Gilligan's Island when she wasn't a major star before it doesn't mean she was 'typecast'. It just means she regressed to the norm."
Unfair,"On the one hand, Gilligan’s Island was just one job in a long career for her. I mean, once I move on from job, I don’t stay in contact with my coworkers nor do I talk up my old jobs. I can understand her wanting to move on from that one job. 

On the other hand, Gilligans Island is an iconic, much beloved show. So many actors would love to have such a show on their resume. Although as I understand it, the show predates the modern royalty payments for reruns, so the actors didn’t make a lot of money from the show."
Unfair,That show was somehow so iconic and yet... stupid. It's just stupid family fun garbage.
Unfair,"She could very well have left a negative impression with people on the show if she didn't want to be there. People that are upset about having to do something they don't want to often act like total assholes even without realizing it, or...sometimes they realize it and just don't care.... See Chevy Chase #Community."
Unfair,Idk the remake with Woody Harrelson was by far the funniest movie I’ve seen in ages.
Unfair,She was really good in the original Stepford Wives. Clearly she had talent.
Unfair,"If you felt you were lied too but fulfilled the contract anyway and then feel that you can move on from there but come to find out that not only is that job holding you back but in many cases the reason why you are not getting jobs, yeah, I understand the resentment.

That said it is not like anyone else from the show did much of anything after the show or for that matter not many TV actors from the late 60's through the mid 70's did much of anything either.  They all seemed to get typecast except for Ron Howard."
Unfair,"I don't have all the facts so I can't make a judgment.

But even had she been more of a star in the show, it still would have been the same silly comedy.  Except she would have been even more typecast to the show had she had a more prominent role.

So based on that logic, she would have had even a worse time trying to land other jobs after the show ended."

Unfair,What movie?
Unfair,"I liked Rampart,…."
Unfair,Triangle of Sadness
Unfair,Thanks
Unfair,"The best part is that if it ends up being about Malcolm having his own kids, and features the parents, poor Malcolm is still technically in the Middle."
Unfair,"This show was a comedy gold mine. I rewatch it from time to time. I'm open for more *Malcolm*.

There were so many great moments, but my favorite was that time [Hal led Craig's co-workers into a revolution. All while Phil Collins plays in the background.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuYZz2n2AjQ&ab_channel=KamB%C3%A1)"
Unfair,“Malcolm the middle aged”
Unfair,"I used to watch this as a kid on TV in my country, just random episodes and loved it. I just finished a full watch for the first time and it brought so much memories.

I would love a movie or reunion of some kind if its done correctly"
Unfair,He was just on the most recent episode of Conan O’Brian Needs a Friend. Conan talks about how Hal is one of the funniest characters to ever grace the screen and that Cranston is one of the best comedic actors there is. Cranston didn’t mention anything about the movie though unfortunately (unless I missed it).
Unfair,This show had phenomenal writing
Unfair,"So Malcolm is working towards being president? Deweey is some rich musician?

Was anything else predicted?

I guess Francis has a typical family man lifestyle 9-5.

Reese probably has his own restaurant (maybe even funded by Francis) would be nice if the two of them got into hospitality with Reese doing the food. Maybe Hal and Lois live with them in the countryside to retire away from the city. Maybe Hal and Lois sold everything they had to fund the hotel.

But Francis enjoyed getting fired from the ranch and working an office job right? I found that the weirdest storyline in the whole show 

Jamie. God knows. Military?"
Unfair,This will be the true end of Breaking Bad since the whole show was a bad dream that Hal had after eating a deep-fried Twinkie.
Unfair,I just want to have the reboot happen so modern day [Stevie](https://imgur.io/HhYrx) can make a cameo.
Unfair,Aaron Paul should make a cameo.
Unfair,Yes. No. Maybe. I don't know. Can you repeat the question?
Unfair,"It’s funny that with all those young actors on that show, Bryan Cranston was the one to break out and have long term stardom."
Unfair,"Wonder if they will have any problems getting Frankie Muniz’s schedule to line up. He’s going full time in stock car racing now. They’d likely have to film in the off-season.

[Why ‘Malcolm in the Middle’ Star Frankie Muniz Is Driving in the ARCA Menards Series](https://www.autoweek.com/racing/more-racing/a42484488/actor-frankie-muniz-arca-menards-series/)"
Unfair,"That show held up super well. 

Also, credit to Vince Gilligan for fighting the brass and casting Cranston as Walter White. I really think this would’ve killed his career had he not gotten the chance to prove himself on Breaking Bad. 

Now, we can look at Hal and laugh about it, while respecting the insane acting we’ve seen Cranston pull off since then."
Unfair,[deleted]
Unfair,"i love love love malcolm in the middle, so part of me doesn’t want this to happen because there’s a 75% chance it’ll be shitty"
Unfair,Did they replace Francis with a wax figure for that photo?
Unfair,I still can't believe he's Walt and Hal. I just watched all of MINTM then straight into Breaking Bad. It took me a whole two episodes to fell it. What a great actor.
Unfair,Malcom in the middle age 😎
Unfair,It’s interesting that movie franchises are getting shows and old tv shows are getting movies. How the turn tables.
Unfair,used to watch this when I was a kid. I’m 25 now and the show still holds up. Absolutely cracks me up
Unfair,Malcolm needs to have a joke where people keep thinking he has amnesia and doesn't remember his childhood.
Unfair,*Do it.*
Unfair,Please let this be a reality I'm rewatching that show now. so damn good.
Unfair,"they could always end up seeing how well it does and then do a new series where Malcolm in the dad now and shows him having to go through fatherhood, plenty of cameos from the main cast"
Unfair,Yes
Unfair,Am I crazy or isn’t Malcom supposed to be President? I distinctly remember the reason why his parents push him harder than everyone else is because they were told he’s a genius and the show started on a flash-forward with him taking the oath of office did that happen or am I nuts?
Unfair,Pleas stop these reboots and derivatives
Unfair,Why is she holding the child by the crotch in that photo lol
Unfair,Let's not do this please.
Unfair,These movies based on decades old movies and shows with the original cast are usually pretty bad. I would prefer him to spend the time of something that has a higher chance to be good.
Unfair,Thank you!
Unfair,yes please!
Unfair,This is wild considering Frankie Muniz doesn’t remember much about being in the show.
Unfair,Finally we’ll find out if the Breaking Bad conspiracy theories are canon.
Unfair,"I am sure this is the minority opinion, but my hopes are low.  I think it will just be depressing and inferior to the final episode."
Unfair,Finally something I can be excited for.
Unfair,It was all Hal's dream sequence is canon
Unfair,Can we not?
Unfair,"Is a Malcolm in the Middle movie happening?

Yes no, maybe, I dooon’t knooow, can you reepeat theee queeestion?"
Unfair,Please don’t
Unfair,No thanks
Unfair,"I dont know if i would want a movie imo. 

I love the show and it holds up super well, but most of these actors have moved on with their lives and u would rather have a fond memory versus a tarnished conclusion. 

Frankie Muniz doesnt really act anymore and i think he had a traumatic brain injury from stock car racing. 

Pretty sure Justin Berfield and Erik Silluvan both stopped acting as well. I dont know what happened to the actress for their mother.   


I guess the stakes are against them in making a successful movie imo"
Unfair,Enough with the remakes.
Unfair,Would Frankie even be able to do it? Doesn’t he have a  severe memory loss problem to the point that he doesn’t remember making most of this show?
Unfair,"Oh god, I have had this dream of this movie for a very long time. Not because I love the show just some random ass dream. 

But this is the story. Hal and Lois are at their son Malcolm's wedding. We see Dewey and Reese with their new wives, along with their older brother Francis and his wife Piama. It is a wonderful ceremony. While the reception is taking place, the dance floor is full of everyone partying, with Hal and Lois sitting at a table with friends around, laughing and drinking. Hal is the focal point in the shot, is visibly shaken, as the camera begins to pan through the crowd that is now clearing a small visual path showing a group of friends standing with Malcolm shooting the shit as old friends do. With one new but familiar face to Hal. Aaron Paul plays a business friend of Malcolm. Who share an interest in cars. 

The night goes on with Hal visibly shaken but playing the best poker face he can.  Eventually, Hal and Aaron collide paths trying to hide each other pasts. But when the two finally get a moment to themselves, they begin to reminisce about their journey and the good times they shared in an old life. Til the question everyone wants to know is asked. ""So, Mr. White what the fuck happened, yo?"" ""The News said you died."" 

We are then given the story of how Mr. White survived all along and gave up the cartel to become Hal."
Unfair,"Pretty sure (don't know his name) the ""children"" actors went through hell of a drug phase or still are, if I'm not mistaken?"
Unfair,Will rapist Danny Masterson’s brother be in it? Francis was a fun character.
Unfair,It'll all be brand new content for Frankie Munez
Unfair,Inb4 they recast malcolm as an atheist genderqueer BIPOC
Unfair,"Reese dies tragically and they all come home to the funeral only to find out that shenanigans begin. Or Malcolm wins the presidency, and their family stays in the white house and then Reese dies. What would it even be about?"
Unfair,No thank you.
Unfair,Plot twist: >!The family has a distant cousin named “Jesse” visit.!<
Unfair,Forget talking let's see some action
Unfair,Please let this actually happen
Unfair,Please let this happen
Unfair,Hell yes! This literally comes in my mind on a weekly basis
Unfair,Best part of this show was when it got canceled.
Unfair,I don’t see how this movie gets made without Cranston being the main character and Malcolm being an afterthought
Unfair,[deleted]
Unfair,Hope Frankie plays a race car driver in the show.
Unfair,I didn’t watch this show till after it was canceled and only reruns were aired. Didn’t think I would have enjoyed it and laugh so much. I think Hal is for sure the best character.
Unfair,Cinematic masterpiece incoming.
Unfair,*faints*
Unfair,BUT WHAT ABOUT FRANKIES NASCAR DREAM BRYAN
Unfair,im excited to see dewey on screen again!
Unfair,Hell yeah. Just recently finished a rewatch.
Unfair,Honestly I hope they follow up on his moms vision of his future.
Unfair,Malcolm in the Movie
Unfair,movie in the middle
Unfair,He had better be president
Unfair,YES YES YES
Unfair,Why have I never seen this show in syndication? I gotta see Steve harvey for an hour every night
Unfair,There was a baby?
Unfair,"I hope that there is Breaking Bad references somewhere.

That and Francis was awesome"
Unfair,Didn't know show creator Linwood Boomer was Adam on Little House on the Prairie and had written episodes of Silver Spoons and Night Court.
Unfair,"I think Reese should be a crypto bro. Not like a billionaire one just a bandwagon one but has made a reasonably high amount of money (like $1.5 million) from having gone all in at the right time. 

That's my only creative suggestion."
Unfair,I wonder if they'll make Malcolm president
Unfair,"Jesus… leave it be.

They said no Breaking Bad sequels….just a matter of time."
Unfair,">The actor would love to revisit the Wilkerson family 20 years later.

Didn't his parents' plan involve Malcolm ascending to the Presidency? Unless they drop that, it will be interesting to see how this goes, probably one look at his siblings and he has no chance at political office."
Unfair,I met frankie muniz at work once. He said he has very little memory of filming Malcom in the middle… now I don’t know if he was lying or not.
Unfair,I always forget there was a good Masterson.
Unfair,"That show has a special place in my heart - one of the only shows my family and I would watch all together and laugh. It’s pure gold. 

I’m totes here for the movie! Yay!!!"
Unfair,Times were simpler when I was binge watching this on Netflix.  Things were just better.
Unfair,It’s agent Cody banks 3. So excited for this news!
Yowamushi Pedal,"Since Season 4 was in 2018, figured a little extra notice might be nice. :)

Yowamushi Pedal,Cartoons about sports? No thanks.
Yowamushi Pedal,"I'm about halfway through season two of Haikyuu right now and I'm really enjoying it. I love how despite the necessary bending of time for the sake of story and character, they do as much as possible to ground the show in real tactics and explains itself and volleyball to the audience. Because of the writing the show could probably succeed with a much less realistic portrayal of sport but the fact that they put the effort in makes it that much better for me."
Yowamushi Pedal,No *Prince of Tennis* here?
Yowamushi Pedal,"Soccer also has:

- ""Area no Kishi"" (The Knight in the Area) 
- ""Keppeki Danshi! Aoyama-kun"" (Clean Freak! Aoyama-kun)

I don't know if they are on any streaming service or not since I don't use any."
Yowamushi Pedal,">Eyeshield 21

I really liked this show.  It was fun, exciting, funny. It showed an understanding of what makes American football a good sport.  Good depiction of why team sports in general bond diverse people together, even opponents.  Great depiction of how even if you have amazing talent you will need an insane amount of work to get anywhere."
Yowamushi Pedal,"I'll add a few more that you missed out:

# Football/soccer

**Aoki Densetsu Shoot!** *\[No official stream\]*

58 episodes and 1 short movie. No English dub.

>This anime is based on the manga, ""Shoot!"", which was published between 1990 and 2003. It won the 1994 Kodansha Manga Award for Shounen. The anime adaptation was broadcast from 1993 to 1994 and thus, does not cover the entirety of the manga. It tells the story of Tanaka Toshihiko (""Toshi"") and his 2 friends, Hiramatsu Kazuhiro and Shiraishi Kenji, who played football together during middle school and were known as the Kakenishi Middle School's Golden Trio, and now they have graduated to high school. In high school though, it's only Toshi who continues to play football. His 2 friends have dropped out of football due to their personal circumstances. They are still in the same high school, Kakegawa High School. The reason that Toshi joined Kakegawa High School is because of his football idol, Kubo Yoshiharu, who plays there. The portrayal of football in this anime is a bit more down to Earth compared with Captain Tsubasa, the preeminent football anime then. It is a contemporary of the basketball anime, Slam  Dunk.

**Hungry Heart: Wild Striker** *\[No official stream\]*

52 episodes. No English dub.

>This anime came out in 2002 at roughly the same time as the manga. It is the creation of Takahashi Youichi (the creator of Captain Tsubasa). Created to tap into the interest in football to tie-in with the 2002 World Cup jointly hosted by Japan and South Korea. The story is about Kanou Kyosuke, a teenage high school student, whose older brother, Kanou Seisuke, is a top Japanese professional football player that plays for A.C. Milan (they were giants in European football then). His older brother taught him how to play and love football but he finds himself being regularly compared to his older brother by others. This pressure of expectation made him lose his passion in the game. This anime covers his path back to find that passion again.

**Whistle!** *\[No official stream\]*

39 episodes. No English dub.

>Based on the manga of the same name. The English-translated manga is published by Viz Media. There are 24 volumes in total. The manga/anime is about a middle school boy named Kazamatsuri Sho who dreams of becoming a professional football player. However, he is short and not that good at it but he does have a passion for it and works hard to improve himself. He makes it into Musashi no Mori Junior High School which hosts a top class football team but he is way down the order. He transfers to Sakura Josui Junior High School to have a better chance to make it into the football team there. The school is not known for football but does have a football team there. When the Sakura Josui football team hears that he transferred in from Musashi no Mori, there were high expectations of him but he could not deliver those expectations. The anime covers his determination to improve himself and to defy the odds for a short player. It's a show that espouses positive values.

# Baseball

**Mix** *\[Funimation\]*

24 episodes. English dub available.

>This is the anime adaptation of Adachi Mitsuru's manga of the same name. The manga is still under serialisation with a monthly release of chapters. This manga is set in the same world as Adachi's classic manga, ""Touch"", but 25-26 years after. It is not necessary to have watched the older series. For those who have, it's like slipping into a pair of comfy home slippers. The story revolves around the 2 Tachibana brothers, Souichirou and Touma,  and their younger sister, Otomi. The 2 bothers are step-brothers to each other but it so happens that they were born on the same date and at approx. the same time (to different mothers, of course). The older brother, Souichirou, and the younger sister are from the maternal side, while the 2nd brother, Touma, is from the fraternal side. They are good at baseball with Souichirou being an excellent catcher and Touma being an excellent pitcher. They make a formidable battery. This is their story from late middle school to early high school. For those familiar with Adachi's works, this is very typical Adachi with his quirks in full display.

**H2** *\[No official stream\]*

41 episodes. No English dub.

>Another anime adaptation of a Adachi Mitsuru manga. This is an earlier manga than ""Mix"" but a later one than ""Touch"". The manga ran from 1992 to 1999. The anime adaptation ran from 1995 to 1996. This series revolves around the competition between Kunimi Hiro, a pitcher, and Tachibana Hideo, 3rd base and 4th batter. In middle school, together with their catcher and friend, Noda Atsushi, their middle school team won the national championships consecutively. However, both Kunimi Hiro and Noda Atsushi were diagnosed with career-ending sports injuries before high school. Thus, the both of them enrolled in Senkawa High School, a high school with no baseball team so that they would not be reminded of not being able to play baseball anymore, whereas Tachibana Hideo enrolled in Meiwa Daiichi High School, a high school with a powerhouse baseball team. Early in their high school life, it turns out Kunimi's and Noda's injuries were wrongly diagnosed and that they are in good health to continue playing baseball. They now decide to form a baseball team in Senkawa to continue their baseball career. The title, ""H2"", relates to the initials of their first name, Hiro and Hideo. It also relates to the initials of the first name of the 2 girls, Amamiya Hikari and Koga Haruka, who are a core part of this series. Amamiya Hikari is the neighbourhood childhood friend of Hiro that Hiro matchmakes with Hideo during primary school years while Haruka is the girl who has a passion for baseball in Senkawa."

Yowamushi Pedal," I personally don't like anime much at all and love sports however there are a ton of NFL Players that watch a ton of anime, as well as NBA players. Im thinking its a generation thing, so I think they overlap a bit a more than people realize but yeah def not widespread."
Heartstrings,I enjoyed this episode more than most.  But can we all agree that and many other gun fights in this series are just atrocious?   They're within spitting distance and unloading on each other and yet only about 6 storm troopers die.  Blasters are just so ineffectual when non heroes use them they may as well not exist.  Their primary function is closing doors and disabling machinery in critical moments.  It's just so dumb.
Heartstrings,"One of my biggest problems with this show is that it often feels like the writers come up with cool moments first and then work backwards on how to get there. Don’t get me wrong, there were some fantastic scenes in this recent episode, but the overall story is still so lackluster. 

It makes me even more disappointed this was originally supposed to be a movie. There’s certainly enough material for a fantastic film. Instead, we’re getting a handful of cool stuff scattered throughout an otherwise poorly written, narratively weak show."
Heartstrings,Watching them back to back and it’s absolutely crazy how much better Stranger things 4 looks.
Heartstrings,"yes, but the action scenes, o man, please! i know stormtroopers are useless but this is TOO much."
Heartstrings,"I said it in a different sub, but something about the visual quality of this episode -- the camerawork, the lighting, *something* -- felt like I was watching a sci-fi show made for the BBC. I can't put my finger on it, but for an episode that should've been extremely cinematic, like Vader seizing and ripping that ship apart, it just felt so... cheap."
Heartstrings,"The writing on this show is so fucking dumb. It gets dumber every week. 

-“Get the hanger roof open! It’s not like there is a giant Star destroyer right above us that can fire down and destroy us.”

-Speaking of basic military tactics, let’s have storm troopers just walk forward in formation while being fired upon by refugees. No going for cover, no spreading apart so the other soldiers can open fire. No, let’s just walk in formation so the front line can fire. And they will walk all casually. Because Storm Troopers have to go from dumb to impossibly stupid. 

-The Maintenance panel for said hanger is awkwardly placed and the only one who can access it is a human child. Good thing we have one of those around. And let’s not talk about how the wee droid opens the access hatch. It just kind of open, let’s the droid in and then closes. Like a ghost opened it. 

-Third Sister decides the moment her evil boss gets fooled after pulling a giant starship from the sky with his space wizard skills is the time to jump him. Now, if you ask why he didn’t just do the same thing to the ship that launched which was seemingly behind the ship he destroyed, let’s say he was tired. But not so tired he couldn’t whip third sister’s ass. Just tired enough he couldn’t delay or stop the other ship. 

-The Grand Inquisitor returns to shit talk Third Sister after Vader gives her the same injury she gave the Grand Inquisitor. And he just shit talks her and leaves. Because no one can survive a lightsaber to the chest. Except himself and Reva as a youngling. But he leaves her there because fuck it. 

-Oh, and the step father of the missing child decided to send a transmission outing her brother and his location. Because he’s a fucking idiot. Everyone on this show is a fucking idiot. Because the writer needs them to be fucking idiots or his fucking idiotic show won’t work. If one character had an IQ above oatmeal, they’d turn around and say “The entire series of events relies on stupidity so I’m just going home. Fuck y’all.”"
Heartstrings,"The whole setup to the face off at the end was so awkwardly executed. The writers roughly knew where they wanted the characters, but didn't arrange it organically. Kenobi gives himself up, just to be sent back in they way he came, overpower his one-enough guard, be pursued by Vader who is pursued by 3rd sister. It was all so janky. I'd say an earlier draft had Kenobi and 3rd sister go against Vader together and Kenobi slip out while Vader was distracted, but that had to be rewritten because that's too renegade"
Heartstrings,"It was both a good episode but has all the same complaints many have had from the beginning.

It feels cheap...and it shows, weird angles, hand cams, questionable CGI.

Also, I get this whole stormtroopers have bad aim gag, but come the fuck on, we need to see them actually hit something. Like it's not funny anymore."
Heartstrings,"A few decent Vader moments wasn't enough to tip the scales for me this episode. Still all the glaring issues with the show. It could have been so much more. 

Unless they have a serious overhaul with the direction of these shows I can't see myself continuing watching them."
Heartstrings,Really had to do that predictable redemption arc for the third sister huh
Heartstrings,It was definitely a better episode. But that's not a high bar to hit and I don't think it was good
Heartstrings,How is it that Disney can create a show about a Muslim girl from Jersey City that is a 100 times better than a show about a top 5 star wars character. No disrespect to Ms. Marvel. I just don't get how marvel can churn out hit after hit with C tier superheros and Lucas film fucks up their most popular characters in star wars.
Heartstrings,The awkward moment when you rather watched Ms Marvel than an another episode of Kenobi.
Heartstrings,Holy moly is Vader strong as ever
Heartstrings,That was easily the best episode
Heartstrings,"I haven’t liked the show so far, especially with the budget is has.

But this was a good episode. Really enjoyed it"
Heartstrings,Compared to the prequels locations it was practically photographs of real locations.
Heartstrings,"Absolutely loved this episode, and enjoying the show overall. Episode 4 was the weakest imo, and even then  I liked it."
Heartstrings,"They do know most of the prequels were shot on green screen, right? artificial locations would make it fit in even more with the prequels."
Heartstrings,"Despite? I've never seen any movies post 1975 with more ugly, artificial looking locations than the prequels."
Heartstrings,It was a good episode but some people will complain regardless. This show has its problems but I'm enjoying the ride and I have a feeling they're going to stick the landing next week.
Heartstrings,"People have already made up their mind about the show, no matter how good an episode migbt be they really need to talk about some negative stuff out of nowhere it seems."
Heartstrings,"I agree with most everyone here but I have to add: if stormtroopers were fixed to be made accurate now, it would ruin the continuity of them being so terrible in every other future movie."
Heartstrings,"There's literally a shot of a rebel and storm trooper fist fighting.

Also as Obi-wan is retreating he's just casually blocking blaster bolts from a trooper within saber range, but the script calls for him to retreat, so Ewan just has to awkwardly shuffle backwards through a door while an extra in a Stormtrooper costume awkwardly shoots at him from 3 feet away.

The action scenes in this series have been so fucking awful, like stuff that's on the level of a CW show."
Heartstrings,"It wasn’t quite as comical as the “shootout” in the Book of Boba Fett finale, but cmon - the rebels were literally in a cave 20 feet away, even blind firing they should have been mowed down."
Heartstrings,"It's a poorly directed show.  Chow isn't a bad director per se, but she's certainly bad at this sort of production.  It's overwhelming her abilities.  

I'm really not throwing her under the bus right now, as there's a whole host of production issues going on here.  I get the sense she's and her crew have been overwhelmed with the task.

Mando S.2ep.5 was made at the same facilities, but look what they did with that."
Heartstrings,"The gunfight where Kenobi and the bounty hunter were going at it on a rooftop was decent enough.

Then came Third Sister with the ""I'll make you wish I just helicopter-sabered over"""
Heartstrings,The failure of Solo relegated Kenobi to Disney Plus
Heartstrings,"None of the events of this episode make sense from a logical perspective. Things only coincidentally happen because the plot needs to somehow move from A to B so we have these huge inconsistencies that are skipped over for convenience.

Like why does Reva move Obi-wan to a different less guarded room so that he can easily escape? Obviously it's done precisely so that can happen because it's what the plot needs to happen.

Why does Disney pull the same 2nd ship that no one notices trick that people complained about in Rise of Skywalker? Because the plot requires it.

Why doesn't the Star Destroyer blockade the planet and prevent the ship from escaping? Because that's what the plot requires.

Why doesn't Vader execute Reva even though he's killed for far less? Because the plot requires it, and also maybe Disney wants to use her in future tie-in media."
Heartstrings,"This is a good summary of my issues as of late with many of Disney+ shows. 

They really do feel like they brushed off projects that was stuck in movie development hell and then they converted them to TV shows with fairly arbitrary episode lengths based on how long it should be until their next show is ready and then they just fill in the extra.

All the core ""good"" parts are there but it is just sooooo much of a drag to get to those parts."
Heartstrings,That’s a really apt description now that I think of it. There’s so much going for it but it seems to stumble the whole way until the”climax”’of each episode
Heartstrings,That’s pretty much all they’ve done with Star Wars since they bought it.
Heartstrings,"The show runner and writer is kind of a hack, so there's that."
Heartstrings,"I am beginning to suspect that they are embezzling the budget for this show somehow. 25 million per 30 min episode. How in the hell does this show look so cheap? Stranger Things got a 30 million budget per hour and a half and it fucking shows. Everything on Stranger Things looks prestige. Obi Wan looks like the first cut of a show when there are tons of banners saying ""SFX not final"". The customes, sets, make up, VFX, sound mix (fuck, the sound mix is mind blowing on Stranger Things. It really juices a home theater), the acting is miles ahead of Obi Wan. You can see and hear every dollar spent on Stranger Things. The script is so good. Obi Wan is bad beyond belief in every respect. It is funny how both shows came out at the same time. You can compare in real time the failures of Disney. I watched 3 episodes and promised not to finish the show. I am done with mediocre Disney fare"
Heartstrings,"Honestly, I started ST4 after obiwans 3rd episode and it felt like I got slapped back to reality, ST4 is on another level compared to obi, I haven't watched another obi ep since, just don't care anymore for it."
Heartstrings,"I watched Stranger Things and The Boys immediately after watching the first 2 eps of Obi-Wan.

It is *insane* how much better these other shows look and feel."
Heartstrings,"ST4 had a massive 30 m budget per ep
 Obiwan was shot on a volume soundstste in England. P"
Heartstrings,To be completely fair most shows arent the level of quality stranger things is
Heartstrings,"All I can think in these shows is just how right they got everything so right in Rogue One's third act and I don't understand how they can keep getting it so wrong now?

Like one of the best things in Rogue one was that for the climactic battle with guns, both sides actually used cover instead of just standing around in the open.

And it even showed that Stormtroopers might be inflexible because of how the empire operates, they can still easily overwhelm the rebels just by even employing basic tactics with larger numbers."
Heartstrings,No kidding. As an epileptic I had to look away for most of that scenes because of the absurd amount of cuts and camera shaking. Plus it was so oddly edited. Like Obi-Wan fought the same two troopers and kept knocking them down every cut for a good 30 seconds.
Heartstrings,"Stormtroopers at the time of the rebellion with Luke, Han & Leia were normals, and they plain sucked, bad training, motivation etc. but these stormtroopers are supposed to be clones of Jango Fett and trained/augmented in vitro. It is like the creators of this series are just mixing timelines, not caring about in-discrepancies and create enough plot holes to boggle the mind, hell some of them are so bad you can fly a star destroyer through it sideways."
Heartstrings,"Every single character moves extremely slowly, from leads down to extras in stormtrooper costumes

Most likely because they don't want to run into and break those fancy LED screens they have for backgrounds, amount of space available for actors to move around is probably miniscule"
Heartstrings,That's a disrespect to Doctor Who which was far more visually interesting and creative than anything in Kenobi despite a limited budget.
Heartstrings,"The prequels were heavy on the green screen, not a lot of practical effects.  Millions complained, even tho using green screen allowed Lucasfilm to make these movies look great, but keep production costs low.  Story writing was hit or miss at times. 

Now with the Disney Shows, its more practical effects, less green screen, but its obvious they're re-using the same sets and locations to film scenes in order to keep it under budget.  Now the production looks cheap and the story writing is a total crap shoot."
Heartstrings,"All of this is correct, but to be fair to the stormtroopers… the standing out in the open technique worked perfectly fine for the rebels who were fighting back. Except grenade lady. But she was fucked when she gave us that sympathetic backstory earlier in the episode. The ole Walking Dead character death sentence.

And yeah, re: Vader’s force-grabbing the ship… seems like the perfect time for a little sneaky backstabbing while he’s preoccupied. Not AFTER they get away. And maybe don’t yell before you strike dummy!"
Heartstrings,Sounds like the same issues as Boba Fett
Heartstrings,"Doesn't Reva specifically send Kenobi in so that he can escape as a means to lure Vader into the tunnels so she can attack him? At that stage they're working together, he doesn't just mysteriously escape—she gives him the platform to do it."
Heartstrings,"Yeah, the ""Volume"" technology really shows its limitations in non-Mandalorian shows. 

Mando works perfectly for close-up shots, the ""Good, the Bad, and the Ugly"" standoff scenes. That's the tone Mando is going for, and the scale works for what they're going for. 

And then you have Obi Wan and a group of rebels fighting Third Sister with about 2.5 feet between them and about 1 in 10 shots lands on someone. It's fucking *silly* how bad that cave scene looked. They were elbow-to-elbow and no one could hit the broad side of a barn. 

I was really looking forward to Obi Wan, seeing what he was up to in his hermit years. But still relying on Luke and Leia, and the contrivance after contrivance... Third Sister looking like she might get some kind of redemption arc... It's just so pathetically predictable and boring.

However, the fight scene between Third Sister and Vader was pretty dope. That's maybe the highlight of the show. But in no way makes up for how milquetoast the rest has been."
Heartstrings,"honestly considering there was like 100  storm troopers there

its like they are aiming to not hit anything.

hell old school gun war had hundreds of men stand in lines
because if enough people fired you would be bound to hit something"
Heartstrings,[deleted]
Heartstrings,"After Kylo Ren's arc basically became a rehash of Vader's arc. It basically sour me on redemption arcs in Star Wars, its become just as a lazy way for writers to kill off characters they had no idea what to do with."
Heartstrings,"She didn’t have a redemption arc.

Wanting to kill Vader is not the same as “turning good”. She’s the first character we have seen use the Dark Side for objectively a good reason, doesn’t change the fact she’s still a monster."
Heartstrings,She's still gonna end up dying.
Heartstrings,"Was it really a redemption. She still hates Obi Wan, she’s presumably meeting them next week(cant wait for Luke and Leia to have met 🙄) and she’s probably not gonna be super friendly

If you couldnt tell from the moment we saw she was force sensitive that she was a youngling wanting revenge, thats on you"
Heartstrings,"A 100 times better? Hit after hit? Are we talking about Marvel TV shows?

I don’t like this show or the general direction of Star Wars lately but let’s not pretend that people are watching Marvel shows for their artistic merit and not because they’re Marvel and might tie into the bloated universe that’s currently being built."
Heartstrings,"Completely different teams. Have you ever worked for a large organization?

The specific people involved mean everything."
Heartstrings,Some us like Obi Wan more than Ms Marvel though
Heartstrings,The virgin Kathleen Kennedy vs the chad Kevin Fiege.
Heartstrings,"> 100 times better

I can accept Ms. Marvel being 100 times better, if only because to me Kenobi is a strong 0.04/10"
Heartstrings,"True, I renewed disney plus for Kenobi but I'm glad Ms Marvel also came out. Now I don't feel like I've wasted my money."
Heartstrings,I gave up on mm..
Heartstrings,Gotta include a Vader-on-the-Rampage scene. Star Wars fans love 'em
Heartstrings,You'll die more optimistic than most.
Heartstrings,This is such a nothing deflection of any criticism. This show looks cheap and the writing is lazy. Just because there’s some cool action set pieces doesn’t mean suddenly everything around it is great.
Heartstrings,[deleted]
Heartstrings,people out here acting like one good episode excuses the letdown of previous eps
Heartstrings,"Rogue One already had accurate Stormtroopers, characters also didn't have plot armor."
Heartstrings,Convenient that only Tala seemed to carry a grenade.
Heartstrings,Solo was 4 years ago though. If they wanted to make Kenobi a 2022 theatrical release they definitely could’ve.
Heartstrings,"Thanks, *The Last Jedi*."
Heartstrings,"Why does Obi Wan suddenly trust Haja with his lightsaber and vital information? What has Haja done to prove he’s trustworthy and not just a swindler?

Why is Obi Wan cool with sending a little girl into the vents to fix the door? When did we establish that she knows how to fix doors?

Why did they bring all that equipment down to destroy the door to the cave, when Reva was able to open it in 2 seconds with her lightsaber?

Why did they take Leia to the rebel base in the first place? Shouldn’t they have just taken her straight back to her father?

Nothing in this show makes sense"
Heartstrings,Thank you. I’ve been seeing praise for this episode everywhere it’s baffling to me.
Heartstrings,That’s what the book of boba Fett was. My guess  it was a lot of reused script idea from that Jabba the Hutt series they floated around Pre-TLJ
Heartstrings,"I found out the $25 million per episode figure earlier, and I'm convinced the production company must be paying Times Square-tier rent for The Volume to Disney on some Hollywood Accounting shit because no way in hell is all of that going into legitimate production costs!"
Heartstrings,I'm thinking the stewards of the Star Wars IP at Disney might not be very good at this.
Heartstrings,"Ya I started obi wan first 2 episodes after watching a few of stranger things and I was just like man this looks like shit compared to stranger things. Honestly pretty much everything about ST4 is better than obi, I’m not sure I can think of one aspect of obi that’s better than st4. Kind of a bummer too because he’s one of the most famous Star Wars characters ever, this shit should look awesome"
Heartstrings,u forgetting that Obi wan had a budget of 25mil n it looks waaaay cheaper
Heartstrings,That’s true but a show about obi wan one of the most popular  Star Wars characters ever you’d expect to be solid and most of all have fantastic production value.
Heartstrings,Rogue One showed that Stormtroopers can be effective when the characters don't all have plot armor.
Heartstrings,Quarry in Cardiff > Desert in California as far as Alien planet stand in's go and at least in Doctor Who they can run down a corridor (they do little else :p)
Heartstrings,On what planet did the prequels look great?
Heartstrings,Are you joking? The prequels looked like shit.
Heartstrings,"That makes sense, but it just feels awkward that none of the several dozen stormtroopers are like ""why the fuck are they sending him back in there with just two of us???"", Especially the two that were sent.  I guess stormtroopers aren't known for their mental capacity and probably follow orders to a fault, but it still felt weird."
Heartstrings,Yes. She wants revenge for Order 66 and thinks she can kill Vader.
Heartstrings,"Even so, what did her ""working together"" with Kenobi even accomplish?

If she was just going to announce that she was  going to attack Vader then do so, why not just do that in the Fortress or whatever"
Heartstrings,"1/10 is giving them way to much credit

try 20"
Heartstrings,"> Yeah, the ""Volume"" technology really shows its limitations in non-Mandalorian shows.

It worked really well in *The Batman* as well. This show is misfiring on all cylinders: the writing, the editing, the blocking, the score, the visuals. 

In the hands of a competent director and crew, the Volume tech seems like an amazing tool, but nothing about this production is screaming competency."
Heartstrings,Maybe they are aiming to hit nothing? Ww1 soldiers often aimed to miss because they didn’t want to kill. From what we know a large portion of stormtroopers are not their willingly.
Heartstrings,"Captain Phasma?


Except she was not a real badass villain. She was just...kinda useless."
Heartstrings,"Wow, damned if you do, damned if you don’t."
Heartstrings,"Yeah, the way it's repeatedly handled comes across as Disney's message is the only way to atone for bad stuff is to die. No making amends, no devoting your life to repair stuff - Nope only way is to give your life. It's actually a terrible message - easy yet utterly macabre."
Heartstrings,Not sure why they didn't just commit to having Kylo actually being evil the way TLJ set it up. Even the original cancelled Colin Trevorrow script had Kylo setup as the main villain.
Heartstrings,"She'll get a redemption arc, actively save Leia, Luke, and Obi-Wan by the end, and Obi-Wan will recognize her as the ""real hero""."
Heartstrings,"Marvel tv does kinda suck but I'm more talking about movies. Characters like the guardians of the Galaxy, shang chi, hell even Thor and iron man in the beginning we're at best b tier superheros. Now they are more popular than star wars characters."
Heartstrings,At least the Marvel shows are professionally made. The quality overall may vary but they are well produced.
Heartstrings,"Yes, because you certainly don’t sound bias against Marvel or anything.

Believe it or not, a good chunk of people watch Marvel because they think they’re good AND have artistic value. They wouldn’t be around as long as they have been if a majority of people didn’t feel that way."
Heartstrings,It is hit after hit tho. It’s critically and financially well receive and people love it. I am not even the biggest Marvel TV fan. I don’t even like Moon Knight that much but I don’t know why you got your panties twisted in a bunch over nothing
Heartstrings,Gotta rebuild Vader's rep after the prequels obliterated it.
Heartstrings,Better that than actively hating everything Disney makes while still waiting till midnight to watch the second it drops
Heartstrings,"There is only one episode left, mind you"
Terrace House,"> A cause of death was not immediately clear. However, the most recent update on her Instagram story on Friday featured a photo of her with her cat, with a caption that reads “goodbye.” She had also recently posted a series of troubling tweets, one of which, according to a fan translation, read that she didn’t “want to be a human anymore.”

>“Thank you to everyone who supported me,” read another message, which also implied that she had been cyberbullied. “I love it. I’m weak, I’m sorry."
Terrace House,Twitter was a mistake. Poor girl.
Terrace House,"I doubt this is solely the result of the laundry incident on terrace house.

I've seen a bunch of the japanese twitter posts showing years of abuse from a couple of accounts that were pretty much daily asking her when she's going to die and shit like that.

I imagine the extra attacks regarding terrace house, lack of wrestling shows to participate in due to COVID and a bunch of other shit in her life has caused this.

It's really sad, my girlfriend and I were really looking forward to watching the rest of Terrace House season and Hana was one of our favourites."
Terrace House,Cyberbullying is no joke. Just because you do not care about cyberbullying doesn't mean others can cope with it. I hope the people who wrote those messages knew they just indirectly murdered a person.
Terrace House,It's been a rough week for pro wrestling. RIP Hana
Terrace House,"She had all the potential in the world. Sky was the limit. A charismatic performer and a extremely talented wrestler. I knew people had been sent to check on her and heard she was ok. Relieved, I then sat my phone down for an hour only to come back and get hit in the face with the news. Gutted. I can't imagine what the Stardom family is going through. R.I.P Hana."
Terrace House,Oh my god. She was so young. Wow.
Terrace House,I love TH and cannot believe this. It is such a sweet show.
Terrace House,[deleted]
Terrace House,"That’s sad, geez"
Terrace House,"Holy fuck, she was one of the nicest people to ever be in the house.."
Terrace House,"That truly sucks.

This is one of the few shows my wife and I watch together and we both loved her."
Terrace House,"So sad that it ended like this.  She was very fun to watch on Terrace House and even though there was some controversy, it was never meant to be serious and the internet overreacted as usual."
Terrace House,"Hana Kimura plays a bad girl in Terrace House, and the actors and producers keep saying the tv show is genuine, although this is quite clear that they make drama happen.
Anyway Hana washed her clothes and forgot one item that was very dear to her. I’m not totally sure but I think it’s a piece of clothe related to her pro wrestling career. Another guy of the house didn’t see it in the washing machine and did his own laundry which caused Hana’s clothe to shrink. She got batshit mad at the guy like the 22 years old kid that she is.
And Japan, as usual overreacted and started bullying her in twitter mostly. There is a tweet that has been now removed saying that the world would be better without her and she liked it before killing herself.

After her death the Japanese football player Keisuke Honda wrote about how people were gutless for bullying a weak person and that they should aime at strong targets like himself. Which is super disturbing but the guy is a professional troll."
Terrace House,"Holy shit. 

National Suicide Prevention Lifeline: 1-800-273-8255"
Terrace House,"So sad for people who can’t find support, suicide hurts everyone."
Terrace House,"I am so sad, she was my favorite, such a joyful personality."
Terrace House,Twitter is such an awful place. I sincerely hope it’s shut down. Rest In Peace.
Terrace House,"If in fact she did commit suicide, I feel like whatever country she is from should be able to trace any cyberbullying and prosecute for it. People have to learn to be more loving towards each other. So many people genuinely suck."
Terrace House,Rest In Peace Hana Kimura. Such a tragic loss
Terrace House,That’s awful. :( the poor girl she must have been going through such turmoil.
Terrace House,The people who drove her to suicide should ALL be held accountable!!!
Terrace House,"Reality TV has dominated TV for 20 years now. Haven’t watched a minute. So glad.

What I do know is that 95% of former contestants on reality shows regret it and caution others.

Editing is so slick these days and the viewer can’t tell. Whole conversations can be contrived. It’s too late, you’ve already signed off legally.

Then Social Media has its day with you."
Terrace House,Look up dead wrestler of the week/month. It’s insane how many wrestlers have died.
Terrace House,"hope she get better place. RIP Hanaさん
I just don’t like how the bullies took her life."
Terrace House,Such a talent in the ring as well. It was great to see her become so good over the last couple of years...RIP
Terrace House,RIP. I hope she found her peace.
Terrace House,rip
Terrace House,Wow this is shocking I just finished the last part too RIP Hana.
Terrace House,Poor lady. If only she was able to get the assistance she needed.
Terrace House,It s extremely sad cause she was projected next top star or ace for Stardom
Terrace House,Cyber bullying is stupid needs to stop
Terrace House,"Holy shit! Can we just start taking care of one another and lifting each other up? If you are a bully online or off, you need your ass kicked."
Terrace House,"Fuck, this is sad. Hana was a good one"
Terrace House,A fact Very sad I don't know what say about. RIP Hana Kimura!
Terrace House,Sad.
Terrace House,"Was Her death to due the Cyberbullying attacks on the social medias?

Look at video on Youtube:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqo43SIrfRs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqo43SIrfRs)"
Terrace House,Disgusting. Social media users should be hunted for sport.
Terrace House,"*I should have killed myself hundreds of times ...* 

# many people do everything they can to preserve bullying, especially in its worst form: physical and material"
Terrace House,Omg no.. why would anyone bully her?? Shocked. RIP ❤️
Terrace House,"Damn RIP 

She was so fun to follow and a great member of the community"
Terrace House,"What's truly said is all these comments justifying bullying by saying ""people who commit suicide are weak.""

The fact is, it's weak minded to think that about anyone that feels suicidal, or commits to killing the self. You don't know the mental weight they were under, and just because you've never felt pushed to kill yourself, doesn't mean they were weak for doing so."
Terrace House,Rest Easy Hana 🙏💔
Terrace House,She’s so beautiful and watching videos of her talk she seems like an emotional person. Wish someone could have helped her before things started going south. This makes my heart ache.
Terrace House, May that beautiful lady rest in peace.
Terrace House,Rip. Gone too soon
Terrace House,Reality TV and Ratings (social media count and community) interaction...therein lies the problem: expectations.
Terrace House,Reality TV and Ratings (social media count and community) interaction...therein lies the problem: expectations.
Terrace House,"This really made me sad. I don’t watch reality tv shows the way people do but I religiously watched this show and for this current season, she was my favorite. She was so nice, beautiful and sweet girl. I just feel like there is a terrible online bullying culture in Japan that have not been addressed well. I see the same thing in South Korea too. I hope they do something about it soon because this is ridiculous."
Terrace House,"Oh no, that's fucking terrible. 22? Goddamn. Rest in peace..."
Terrace House,This news reminds me of Hannah Baker from 13 reasons why. The names of both (Hana and Hannah) are quite similar as well.
Terrace House,"It really upsets me to see this. I learned so much from her by watching Terrace house. I cried with her and could relate completely with her feelings, so young, so beautiful, just great as a person and with a bright future.   
Rest in peace."
Terrace House,sax
Terrace House,"Very sad, she was so pure and honest."
Terrace House,"Poor girl, cyberbullies committed murder."
Terrace House,"Unless you have felt this way I just dont think you can understand (not to gatekeep suicidal depression its just hard to explain)

I didnt know who she was but its sad that she felt that way and Im sorry she had to go through that.  I cant imagine what its like especially with the 'world' of twitter anway saying horrible things to you all the time and being hated.  


I hope for her now that all of her problems are gone and she is at peace in some way."
Terrace House,Omg this is heartbreaking. Hana you were such a sweet being
Terrace House,[removed]
Terrace House,"I am so sad about Hana, she was one of my favorites on the show - I thought she was so pure and genuine. I think she was disappointed in Kai for many reasons and her anger stemmed from a loss she felt at the possibility of something with him being over in her mind. (She had also been unsuccessful with/let down by Ryo so her anger could have been a build-up even from that.) Kai’s flubbing the laundry situation was just a catalyst. I came here to see if anyone had any more information on whether any of her Stardom cast members tried to get to her or help her after her (cry for help) Twitter posts. I lived in Japan for a few years and it is very common for people to be very hard on themselves and not reach out for help. Shame at any failure to deliver, or letting people down, can be overwhelming and, unfortunately, suicide is too commonly the “out”. RIP, Hana-chan."
Terrace House,"RIP Hana, you will be missed."
Terrace House,"Let's show love by raising money for Hana's family.

The death of Hana Kimura is an absolute tragedy. I hope this serves as a reminder that interactions on social media can have a serious effect on the mental health of anyone, no matter who they are.

[https://www.facebook.com/john.grace.121/posts/3360728023960239:0](https://www.facebook.com/john.grace.121/posts/3360728023960239:0)"
Terrace House,"I think this just goes to show the horrible, negative influence that social media can have on a person. It appears to be especially bad in Korea and Japan, for some reason. It seems every year there are a few celebrities who commit suicide due to social media bullying, usually young women. 

Reddit often tries to be a decent place but even this website can get pretty insane. I think it's healthier to limit social media and spend more time with loved ones in real life. Unfortunately for me I can't really do that right now, so all I have is social media. It's a poor substitute, though."
Terrace House,"The problem with reality tv is that it's real, but it's not real. It shows only bits and pieces, often reducing people into caricatures. The events might be real, but the depiction of them and the people involved is edited. Fiction can be spun out of non-fiction if you pick and choose which elements to show. Audiences will go off the information they're given and fill in the blanks.

It's like those ""based on a true story"" movies. The fact that part of it is true messes with audience's heads as to how much of it actually is. Social media arrived at a terrible time in this aspect, as we're not taught critical thinking, let alone in a new application as this. I'm still not sure that we as a species were ready for social media."
Terrace House,[deleted]
Terrace House,Bet the marked it down as covid related
Terrace House,Social media is cancer of 21st century. if oyu can't handle this shit you shouldn't be on social media. people are trash.
Terrace House,[deleted]
Terrace House,f in the chat
Terrace House,Just another reason why reality TV is garbage and we should go back to making real programming that actually takes talent and creativity
Terrace House,Are celebrities dying more often? Or is it just me
Terrace House,R.I.P.
Terrace House,"Never heard of her before, but R.I.P."
Terrace House,This is not Japan...
Terrace House,She was so pretty too.  Suicide is so sad man.
Terrace House,"This season is cursed.  Terrace Haunted House.  Watch out for Kai, Vivi, Emika and Tupas are next, Kai has depression, Vivi can be impulsive, Emika had a breakdown on the show, Tupas has severe anger and drinking issues"
Terrace House,5
Terrace House,"Has anyone possibly looked at the factor that CTE might have made this worse for her?

I’m sure wrestling isn’t too good for you, since you are constantly getting it knocked around"
Terrace House,🙏🙏🙏
Terrace House,"So I initially felt bad for this girl, but then I just watched [https://streamable.com/fvy4pj](https://streamable.com/fvy4pj) 

What a disgusting person."

Terrace House,The government killed her
Terrace House,Why do people put so much stock into what others think?
Terrace House,[removed]
Terrace House,[removed]
Terrace House,She deaded herself.
Terrace House,"Guess she dealt with Albert Camus’s most important philosophical question. People know you don’t have to engage or even read social media, right? Or just block all the negative if you really have to? Have a friend who can handle it, do it for you. The ego-feeder swings both ways.

Edit: Would love to know what got these downvoters panties in a twist. Wasn’t exactly controversial or incorrect. Oh, you can only be blatheringly positive and slobber over everything these days. Christ, grow a fucking backbone."
Terrace House,tylerthecreatorcyberbullying.jpg
Terrace House,Weak people commit suicide. Where the fuck were the people close to her that certainly knew she was susceptible to this shit?
Terrace House,we need another world war 'cause people have never been softer and mentally weaker than today
Terrace House,There’s a post on /r/squaredcircle as well where it pretty much states she killed herself because of an incident from Terrace House and fans just dragging her through the mud for it.

Terrace House,Its insanity to me that its easier to kill yourself than to switch off social media.
Terrace House,"Yup. I think on a tweet she mentioned how people sent her message to die or just disappear and that it has affected her like crazy and that she was ""weak.""

Willing to bet it's from people who subscribe to r/MGTOW and r/TheRedPill that regularly harass her. Most of the posts on those subs are hateful and encourage violence and online harassment of women."
Terrace House,"Yeah these cases are usually a result of long term depression rather than one incident. She must have been really good at hiding it, because I never saw any signs of it throughout her time on the show. She had an extremely bubbly personality."
Terrace House,Fans of shows can be dicks. They framed it like she is the villain and she got a wave of hate
Terrace House,"Maybe they want to mourn privately before posting a memorial note.

Edit: Mila, Sacho, Lauren Tsai have posted in kanji on Twitter."
Terrace House,"Why do you find it so weird that people don't want to post highly personal stuff/emotions/opinions online? Ik everyone mourns differently, but I think posting that stuff online is weird. It's not always the case but many times I see posts like that, especially so soon after a death, it comes off as attention whoring narcissism.

""Hey everyone my grandma just died! She was a great person, she is why I am so great. Look at me being great, mourning her greatness. Damn am I great.""

Edit: the conversation below was mostly due to misunderstanding. We both agree everyone deserves to mourn in the way they find best. And to clarify, I am not saying all posts of mourning are narcissistic, it depends on the context of the post."
Terrace House,Almost everyone and cast members from previous seasons that didn't know her personally have said something by now: https://www.reddit.com/r/terracehouse/comments/gp8nnk/statements_from_others_on_hana_kimuras_death/
Terrace House,"i definitely think it's not about the company telling them to stay silent, mourning takes time and i wouldn't blame them if some took weeks to post anything about her. Their friend just died and the last thing they want is someone online who doesn't know them at all to question why they are silently mourning right now and interpreting as anything else but silent mourning."
GTO: Great Teacher Onizuka,"Lmfaoo I tried watching the first episode yesterday. I liked it until the absurdity of the scene with david tenant and the tutor with the flashdrive. No idea why he didnt just tell her it was the kid in church (who clearly needs professional help). Instead we get a completely ridiculous conflict where the tutor falls and hits her head 🤣🤣🤣🤣 and eventually falls down the basement stairs??? 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 All because these idiots cant communicate

I turned off the show right after that scene"
GTO: Great Teacher Onizuka,"I watched it for David Tennant. Figured if he was in it, couldn't be bad. I was wrong. Still love him though."
GTO: Great Teacher Onizuka,[deleted]
GTO: Great Teacher Onizuka,How they wrote that part of the show....unbelievable but i still had fun with the show.
GTO: Great Teacher Onizuka,"I just finished the first episode and I agree that Tennant's character made a series of increasingly stupid decisions.  He doesn't have any legal or moral obligation to protect the pedophile's identity, so there was no reason for him to not just tell her who the flash drive really belonged to and clear his son's innocent name in the process.  I don't even understand why he kept the flash drive to begin with instead of immediately destroying the thing, which would've avoided this whole mess.

I think the teacher should've been more open to the flash drive not being the kid's though, especially considering how nonchalant he was about her seeing its contents.  Did she really think someone his age would be so cavalier about their teacher seeing actual child porn?  That said, I liked how she basically saw no way out of the situation and so made certain to leave as much evidence as behind to really screw Tennant's character over for her likely eventual murder.

I've really enjoyed the Tucci and Estimond side of things though."
GTO: Great Teacher Onizuka,"It’s one of the worst written shows this year. So many truly unbelievable choices made by David Tennant’s character. There’s been a few threads on this show now and every one is the same. 

The show is terrible"
GTO: Great Teacher Onizuka,Janice is fucking stupid. Everyone acts stupid.
GTO: Great Teacher Onizuka,I stopped watching after the first 10 mins that scene in the train is terrible.
GTO: Great Teacher Onizuka,Just an FYI that you can't just watch the prison bits and skip the Tennant bits. The two are entirely intertwined.
GTO: Great Teacher Onizuka,"Convicted death row inmate turned Sherlock, with an intriguing backstory that is never explored, and, on the other side of the pond, an upstanding vicar who kidnaps the nun from Dracula. How will the show tie these two plotlines together? Spoiler, it won't.

Convince me this wasn't planned as a 20 episodes thing that was ultimately cut down to four for whatever reasons."
GTO: Great Teacher Onizuka,"Funny how people in the comments are comparing Tucci's character with Sherlock Holmes and not with Hannibal Lecter.

Anyway, this is probably the stupidest show I've seen in my life and the only way I could finish it was at 1.5x and skipping all the parts that felt absolutely insufferable.

Everything is so bad. The premise, the plot, the camera work, the choice of music. I really feel for the cast who were put in this position."
GTO: Great Teacher Onizuka,"I'm halfway through episode 2.

&#x200B;

Janice annoys me, why on earth wouldn't she listen to Fr. David Tennant lmao?"
GTO: Great Teacher Onizuka,I just got the part of the flash drive and it’s so stupid I don’t know if I want to continue. To protect a deeply troubled man that is a pedophile because he might commit suicide. But who cares about the kids or any crime he may commit in the future????!
GTO: Great Teacher Onizuka,"I just finished it and my jaw was on the floor for the majority of the show because I am just absolutely astonished at how unseemly, banal, unbelievable and lazy the writing is. One misunderstanding after another immersed with well worn cliché after cliché.  A very unsatisfying ending to an abysmally horrid show."
GTO: Great Teacher Onizuka,I agree with all the the criticisms of this stupid show but I still really liked it. It’s a bit like those Harlen Corbin adaptations Netflix keeps making. Nonsense but very enjoyable nonsense
GTO: Great Teacher Onizuka,"There is two shows here, one carried by Tucci and Estimond and another buried by the rest."
GTO: Great Teacher Onizuka,It’s a television show bro. Chill.
GTO: Great Teacher Onizuka,Glad I came here to save myself any more time invested; removed from my list. I'm sad to see David Tennant in this role.
GTO: Great Teacher Onizuka,"Yes, I agree. I kept thinking about that floppy disk that led the FBI to the BTK killer in the mid 2000s, and how downloaded files that are saved on a memory device will have some reference to the computer's ID string or name.

And of course, the computer's registry automatically tracks USB device history and creates unique IDs for each device. So had the vicar simply told the police the truth, their forensics team could quickly match the flash drive's metadata to Edgar's computer registry, to validate the story. The vicar's response to the know-it-all tutor was completely implausible.

I found myself incapable of watching most of the vicar's scenes. It was so frustrating and stupid. So I watched the show strictly for Stanley Tucci (his character, at least, was interesting and the story line plausible)."
GTO: Great Teacher Onizuka,"Also what the fuck is the deal with the OVER USED ""gOdS gOnnA cUt yOu dOwn"" music?! 

To those who haven't seen it, I am NOT exaggerating when I tell you that I heard that song FIVE TIMES!!!"
GTO: Great Teacher Onizuka,Stupidest fuckin show on Netflix. I stopped paying for this garbage subscription after watching this show. Another clear attempt to push the lefty agenda down people’s throats. Oh yea everyone is capable of killing NO SHIT SHERLOCK but we’re fuckin reasoning humans. What a shit show.
GTO: Great Teacher Onizuka,Am i late watching this? Like most of y'all i had to stop a moment to see if this shit show is worth binging.. damn. after that dumb fucking flashdrive porn scene and the tutor fell in th basement.. I cant watch this shit. And now im a bit glad stumbling here to see affirmations i needed to stop. Sucks cause i love David Tennet. This shit is awful
GTO: Great Teacher Onizuka,"Watching it right now and that scene just happened and was so stupidly implausible that I hopped on reddit. Like that’s how you handle that situation? Makes more sense to implicate yourself/ your son, threaten the safety of the math tutor, and not deal with the safety of harmed children because a pedophile might self harm further? Like what?"
GTO: Great Teacher Onizuka,I just paused at this scene to look for reviews before I invest any more time in this garbage 😂
GTO: Great Teacher Onizuka,"I just started watching this show. What I found immediately stupid was: 

1. The son was totally cavalier about it being his porn (of course the plot is he was trying to cover for his dad in an effort to get money). Like if it was truly his and he just got caught with illegal porn he wouldn't been cavalier about it.

2. She's been tutoring him for months (at a minimum) if I understood correctly. She should know his character and personality quite well at that point.

Yet her immediate and foregone conclusion is that it is his beyond a shadow of doubt? What???? Is she stupid?

Well I kept watching and she is indeed stupid. I think the writers are trying to make her seem 'clever', but everything she's done that I've seen thus far is just antagonize her captors and make it worse. She's basically begging to be murdered every episode."
GTO: Great Teacher Onizuka,"I tried this show earlier today and turned it off halfway through the first episode. Decided to check Reddit to see if I was just overreacting to one bad scene

Glad I saved myself 3.5 hours of “this is going to get good eventually, right?”"
GTO: Great Teacher Onizuka,"Edited, don't know how vicar turned into iCarly"
GTO: Great Teacher Onizuka,"Im halfway through the first episode, and although David has been making stupid decisions, I find the teacher more annoying.  Why the heck was she so hell bent on reporting the kid, even after David told her its not either of theirs?  The kid was obviously covering for the dad, and the dad was covering for one of his patrons.  If she just left it alone, Im sure the priest would have gone to the authorities about the true owner of the porn. But the stupid lady was so instant SHE be the one to do it.  It was annoying."
GTO: Great Teacher Onizuka,"Apparently I should have scrolled down a bit further before writing my first reply. That was my point to: why would she be so convinced it was his with him acting so cavalier about it. Edgar's reaction when confronted and realizing he'd been caught by the Vicar would have been the son's reaction when Janice 'caught' him (or at least something close to it).

I agree leaving her DNA and what not all over the place was fairly smart, but that was about it. Everything else thus far (I haven't finished yet) that she has done seems like the writers trying to make her seem 'clever' but to me it just comes off as antagonistic, forcing her captors into a corner where their own solution is murder. She has been downright stupid if you ask me."
GTO: Great Teacher Onizuka,"I have wondered if there has been a reddit question thread on this.

What would you, parent, do if your child was a rapist, pedophile etc.  Most parents do seem to deny, protect.  But maybe I've gotten that from shows lije this.  And cases lije the Brock Turner case  football player rape cases"
GTO: Great Teacher Onizuka,Yea everybody is dumb but she’s the worst cuz she thinks she’s so smart
GTO: Great Teacher Onizuka,"Lady can’t stop, think, and listen for a moment. Her stubbornness is unreal"
GTO: Great Teacher Onizuka,"Same! Was rolling my eyes so hard at that, don't think I even got to the 10 minute mark."
GTO: Great Teacher Onizuka,I’ll just watch the David tennant parts for the eye candy in this show.
GTO: Great Teacher Onizuka,"So so annoying, I had to put basement scenes on 1.5 speed"
GTO: Great Teacher Onizuka,"Apparently, according to Brits, its,a dark comedy.  The absolute absurdity of stupid decisions.  Not sure it's translating"
GTO: Great Teacher Onizuka,"Same. Just finished it and I have that *I wanna stare out the car window and think* feeling going on. Maybe I have bad taste, which is fine, but I thought it was a gr8 show."
GTO: Great Teacher Onizuka,"Don't flat line on emotion, dude"
GTO: Great Teacher Onizuka,"Oh wow, didn't even think about the computer I'd stuff, so yeah totally implausible.  I've seen where Brits say is a comedy so I think us yanks didn't get it.  Regardless I think it was out there.  Which is great that weird things get produced."
GTO: Great Teacher Onizuka,Unfortunately many tv shows have these kind of tropes. The lazy writers have to give the characters irrational stupid decision making in order to develop any kind of conflict to keep the plot going
GTO: Great Teacher Onizuka,SAME HERE
GTO: Great Teacher Onizuka,Are you drunk right now.
GTO: Great Teacher Onizuka,"But it wasn’t their kid. It was a troubled grown man who he barely knew. It made no sense for his character to do what he did. A loose “oh the dudes suicidal wah wah” but that would be an even bigger reason to call the authorities and get him help. He was cutting even before any police involvement, makes no sense to protect him from it. 

Instead he very neglectfully and controlling my manhandled and assaulted a woman over and over. 🤣 Highly unrealistic and nonsensical even for the standards built up in the show."
GTO: Great Teacher Onizuka,I think the down vote shows that parents protect their porno Pedro's and rapists.  Just like this show
GTO: Great Teacher Onizuka,I think she is suicidal and actively wants to be murdered.
GTO: Great Teacher Onizuka,"Yeah it was the worst part, it felt like a bad fanfiction that had no buisness with the other part of the show."
GTO: Great Teacher Onizuka,Just finished 2nd episode and might as well finish it with spoof comedy of genre in mind. Kinda like the series *The Woman in the House Across the Street from the Girl in the Window*
GTO: Great Teacher Onizuka,Still a television show.
GTO: Great Teacher Onizuka,"Huh, that's interesting. It wasn't marketed as a comedy but it definitely has elements of a screwball comedy--which explains why I disliked it so much (that subgenre always makes me frustrated and annoyed because it's so avoidable). Interesting insight. Thanks"
GTO: Great Teacher Onizuka,*The Woman...* was a spoof comedy? I started it and couldn't watch it. I must've missed the point.
GTO: Great Teacher Onizuka,"Yes it's a comedy making fun of all the cliches of the genre, all exaggerated. Even the title is a joke"
GTO: Great Teacher Onizuka,Righteous Gemstones is lampooning Christian mega churches. It’s not a religious show.
GTO: Great Teacher Onizuka,"I'm a big fan of Danny McBride and Co.


What I love most is his ability to let his co-stars shine. Alot of writers who also act would want to have the best lines but in all his shows his co-stars are the ones who truly bring the laughs. Stevie is my favourite comedy character ever."
GTO: Great Teacher Onizuka,All three are top notch. You don't need to be a Christian to enjoy Gemstones lol
GTO: Great Teacher Onizuka,"Kenny Powers is his greatest role and it's not even close

Too many quotables"
GTO: Great Teacher Onizuka,"In reference to The Righteous Gemstones, a satirical take on the lives of a family that runs an Evangelical megachurch, you said:
“…but outside of the religious tone it was pretty great.” 

What in the hell is even that?"
GTO: Great Teacher Onizuka,"If you want to dig through the internet you might be able to find an old clip of him on his promo tour for ""The Foot Fist Way"" (dark comedy about a shitty kids karate instructor) where he was on Late Night with Conan back in the mid 00's. He came on in character with some of his students to do a karate demonstration (punching boards, flips, etc.) and was berating the kids constantly for screwing up.

This was before people knew who Danny McBride was so they thought it was some drunk guy legitimately yelling at kids for ruining his big late night appearance and the audience was *very* uncomfortable the whole time (Conan as well, maybe he was in on it, I don't know). I remember watching it when it aired and feeling the same then seeing him in Tropic Thunder or something the next year and laughing my ass off realizing what he did."
GTO: Great Teacher Onizuka,"All three are great but Vice Principals is the best imo. It really benefits from having such a tight storyline that appropriately evolves throughout the entire show and a satisfying finale. It just feels like such a complete story with no filler or boring, distracting b and c plots to fill time. Not only are the characters fantastic (Lee Russel is the funnest character out of all three shows imo) but the way the show changes course or changes tone throughout the story is really fun. Great pacing."
GTO: Great Teacher Onizuka,"If you haven't seen it already, This is the End is an absolutely hilarious Danny McBride performance."
GTO: Great Teacher Onizuka,“You’re fuckin out!”
GTO: Great Teacher Onizuka,The Foot Fist Way
GTO: Great Teacher Onizuka,"I too just showed these to my girlfriend and she loved them. 

They do an incredible job of humanizing awful people.

Agree that Vice Principals is the best one."
GTO: Great Teacher Onizuka,I’m from Southeast NC and I love Righteous Gemstones! Hits the nail precisely on the head as far as Christian hypocrisy goes. Also love his other comedies. Dude is one of NC’s favorite sons!
GTO: Great Teacher Onizuka,everything he has been in is fucking amazing. and walton goggins ffs same thing.
GTO: Great Teacher Onizuka,"i've been trying to let everyone know about the gemstones. a couple episodes into the second season and i think it's just as good as eastbound and down, which i think is one of the funniest shows ever made. the crew that makes these shows just nails the type of comedy they are going for. always perfect casting too."
GTO: Great Teacher Onizuka,"Vice Principals is illegally funny. 

I went on a Danny McBride rampage after Righteous Gemstones, and VP was soo goddamn funny. Man what a series lol."
GTO: Great Teacher Onizuka,"The frustration in his voice when he screams (I think in episode 1, it's really early) ""I'm Kenny Powers!"" during an argument with his brother is hysterical to me. I can't not crack up watching it. The prince trying to command the tides."
GTO: Great Teacher Onizuka, McBride is funny as hell especially if you grew up white trash and actually knew people like his characters. Saying he nails it is an understatement.
GTO: Great Teacher Onizuka,"Eastbound & Down is super awesome, Vice Principals is really great.

I wish these were available on Netflix!"
GTO: Great Teacher Onizuka,How in the absolute fuck could Edi Patterson not get mentioned in this post????
GTO: Great Teacher Onizuka,"The man is absolutely top tier. 

I'd fallen off of Eastbound and down and never gone back to it, then watched vice principals as it was airing and ended up going back to eastbound and down while waiting for VP S2. What a fuckin treat that was. Don't know why I ever stopped watching I'm the first place."
GTO: Great Teacher Onizuka,Did you feel it in YOUR PLUMMMMS?
GTO: Great Teacher Onizuka,“I love you in a make me cum kind of way”
GTO: Great Teacher Onizuka,"I actually found S2 of Gemstones to be pretty bad.  Especially Kelvins storyline, that shit was absolutely awful."
GTO: Great Teacher Onizuka,"> McBride's first HBO show, it started off to be a little mediocre

You are saying this precisely because you watched the other shows first.  At the the time EB&D came out, it was a monster hit and the talk of every water cooler in every office."
GTO: Great Teacher Onizuka,"Not my cup of tea.  I gave up on him after Eastbound and Down when I decided he always plays the same loud obnoxious narcissist character.

People tell me that Righteous Gemstones is good but I am now at the point that I won't enjoy something just because he is in it."
GTO: Great Teacher Onizuka,"I really haven't been able to get into Righteous Gemstones. Adam Devine is extremely grating and is too transparent of an actor - even when he's playing different versions of himself, he's still always basically just himself. 

I couldn't stand Edi Falco in Vice Principals so I don't know if I can handle her increased role here."
GTO: Great Teacher Onizuka,"I liked VP, gemstones was alright. East Bound (I know came before) but I just didn't like it."
GTO: Great Teacher Onizuka,"> Vice Principals, and Eastbound & Down

Ugh, no."
GTO: Great Teacher Onizuka,Interesting I’ve always heard Season 2 of EB&D fell off but came back strong in season 3
GTO: Great Teacher Onizuka,He don’t miss! I’ve loved every show he’s made.
GTO: Great Teacher Onizuka,Who wants to suck an old man’s dick?
GTO: Great Teacher Onizuka,I fuckin' love his shows.
GTO: Great Teacher Onizuka,"I could not agree with this more. I had the same realization in the winter. I’ve always been a huge McBride fan (Eastbound & Down is hilarious) but I didn’t see Vice Principals or Gemstones until this year.

And as much as I love Eastbound & Down, I absolutely love Vice Principals. Yes the whole Gamby/Russell thing is classic and insanely funny, I couldn’t get enough"
GTO: Great Teacher Onizuka,Danny mcbride and walto goggins is a good duo
GTO: Great Teacher Onizuka,"Gemstones is fantastic, it starts out trying to make you hate everyone but with time you actually grow sympathetic to most of them and realize that while they're kind of shitty people that take advantage of people's faith, they're mostly just a product of their environment, and all have a good side and slowly grow as characters."
GTO: Great Teacher Onizuka,"great rec, thank you"
GTO: Great Teacher Onizuka,"At the same time, it’s pretty respectful to religion/Christianity. It doesn’t mock Christians, even the ones who might find an appeal in a megachurch. Even the Gemstones- their faith is not what makes them foolish and they seem to believe in what they are doing."
GTO: Great Teacher Onizuka,I really don’t understand how OP can watch that much Danny McBride stuff and still get wooshed so hard that he thinks Gemstones is a religious show lmao
GTO: Great Teacher Onizuka,"In Stevies voice: ""A sock on the the doorknob is the international sign that someone is getting laid. AND IT WAS ME DOOOG!"""
GTO: Great Teacher Onizuka,I feel like christians would be the minority in liking it. Especially the groups that love Joel Osteen
GTO: Great Teacher Onizuka,"Right. In my eyes the show shits on religion, especially the mega churches."
GTO: Great Teacher Onizuka,Practice is the crutch of the talentless
GTO: Great Teacher Onizuka,I can throw a ball faster than fuck!
GTO: Great Teacher Onizuka,"""Can I wear the Scream mask? The mask from Scream? When I do you from behind?"""
GTO: Great Teacher Onizuka,Hehehe...what's his name? Shrek?
GTO: Great Teacher Onizuka,"They also said Eastbound and Down ""started off to be a little mediocre"" so it's important to remember that anyone, literally anyone even the bar drunk, can make a post in this sub with their all important opinions."
GTO: Great Teacher Onizuka,"My thought too. Does op think the show is trying to glorify Christianity? Or that they are trying to proselytize? If so, the whole theme just went way over their head."
GTO: Great Teacher Onizuka,Daddy chill
GTO: Great Teacher Onizuka,the foot fist way is a translation of Tae Kwon Do
Fate/stay night,Not as exciting as last weeks episode but certainly was not expecting so see Zeke.
Fate/stay night,i still cant get over sasha...
Fate/stay night,"Fuck Gabi,

All my homies hate Gabi"
Fate/stay night,"I knew her not wearing a chest plate gear was a huge red flag.... fuck 

🥔's in the chat."
Fate/stay night,"Finally bingewatched the whole series after stopping mid-way through S2 a few years ago. Can't believe I have to wait a week between episodes now. This just checks better and better.

I'm having serious AoT withdrawal now and want a new anime series to try. Anyone have any recommendations based on AoT?"
Fate/stay night,"honestly I love this season so far but since Eren's mother died he lowkey been a developing psychopath and now or maybe before now, he just tipped."
Fate/stay night,Rumble the mainland scum for killing Sasha!
Fate/stay night,"rip potato girl....i was lowkey crackin up her last words were ""meat"" but same time im devastated.  #fuckgabi"
Fate/stay night,"Just finished binging over about 2 weeks. My. God. Unreal. This is narratively better than most live action tv series.

Sasha didn't need to die, goddamnit. Idiots for celebrating too early.

I lowkey always suspected something like this from Zeke Jaeger. Just from the way they animated the scene where his parents are taken away, there was something a little off about it. But this brings up the question: how far back does this go? Did he purposefully slaughter basically the entire Scout Regiment as part of a bigger picture plan? Now that is some next level psycopath shiiiiiz

Also, I know that they've set up this season wonderfully in order to first of all make you connect and empathize with the mainland Eldians, but I think having only just watched the battle of Shiganshima only like 5 days ago being super fresh in my mind, my god... their destruction was so satisfying. Screw you guys! You don't know what true suffering is! (Apart from being second class citizens and being used as fodder in countless wars)"
Fate/stay night,Potato Girl will be missed TT-TT I wish she had a happy ending
Fate/stay night,"So, even though Sasha obviously (as did the other characters) matured, so much so that her voice itself matured, in the end, all her character ever boiled down to is food? EXTREMELY disappointing.  At least.. That is my opinion.."
Fate/stay night,"Hey dumbasses, wait until you're back at the island, or at least until you've left enemy territory to start celebrating. She didn't need to die. ;_;"
Fate/stay night,"Slightly off topic, but could anybody please elaborate what they enjoy about this series? I do not get it."
Fate/stay night,rip blouse
Fate/stay night,That's got my head spinning. How far back has he been planning stuff?
Fate/stay night,I will think of her every time I make a sandwich with deli meat.
Fate/stay night,/r/FUCKGABI
Fate/stay night,"The obvious would be ""Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood"" if you haven't already watched it ofcourse"
Fate/stay night,"Vinland Saga is excellent.

Code Geass is very good, albeit flawed.

The Fate franchise is amazing, but it has multiple series and some were adapted out of order, so many people get confused about where to start. I can give you the watch order if you’re interested."
Fate/stay night,"It’s not at all like AoT but I can not recommend Golden Kamuy enough. It’s exciting, riveting, and hilarious"
Fate/stay night,"The mystery, the action, the soundtrack, the animation, the plot, the themes. I will say that I did find the characters rather weak at the beginning of the story but as the series progresses they get far more complex and compelling. For me the biggest draw is the mystery, everything about the world is shrouded in it, and the reveals leave you with more questions yet it's intriguing."
Fate/stay night,"The series is incredibly good about building put the core mystery and expanding on it. It has great storytelling and the characters, no matter how minor, get some excellent development. It balances action and drama really well with the underlying mystery.

That and the show is about humans fighting grotesque kaiju sized mutant humans that eat humans. And the humans defend themselves by throwing themselves at the monsters using a complex system of air bursts and grappling hooks while using swords as their preferred killing tool."
Fate/stay night,"Lots of colossal twists that are integrated expertly into a constantly developing plotline.  The best I can say without ruining anything is that almost nothing about the world as it's set up in season one is exactly as it seems.

I frequently make the comparison that long television series often have the bad habit of tacking on additional plotlines, new enemies, etc. to keep things fresh each season, but AoT has revelations in later seasons tying into the earlier seasons in a very logical way and gives you the impression that the creator planned the whole series out before even starting, which is probably the case."
Fate/stay night,Looks like next week we might find out? Looked like it was a bit of a flashback for what has been happening with the scouts over the timeskip.
Fate/stay night,Would be cool if he was coordinating with The Owl to give Grisha the Attack Titan in order to set our current events into motion.
Fate/stay night,[deleted]
Fate/stay night,Hit me up
Fate/stay night,">but I can not recommend Golden Kamuy enough.

U tryna make him question his sexuality?"
Fate/stay night,This is interesting. Thank you!
Fate/stay night,How? He was a kid back then. If this is a manga spoilers please delete it.
Fate/stay night,"The secondary main characters all had great development earlier seasons Erwin/Levi/Sasha/Connie/Jean etc. Their past was visited, their hometowns, their motivations, their friendship. What more do we want for side character?  This season is all about chaos, war and obviously Eren."
Fate/stay night,"Isayama had planned to kill Sasha already in S2 while saving that little girl, that's why he didn't have a bigger role for her in store in the later seasons either.. But this was a way better way to give her death impact than have it happen in S2E02.

Also the preview for next episode shows that it will shed some light on her during the timeskip."
Fate/stay night,"It's anime, none of the side characters have real arcs anyway"
Fate/stay night,"There are three routes of the Fate/Stay Night, the VN, and each was adapted separately. These three have to be watched in order, as despite being separate routes/timelines, they act thematically as the introduction, middle and conclusion of the full story.

In order, the adaptations are:

1. Fate/Stay Night (2006) by Studio Deen. This one was adapted by a different company, and is much lower in quality. Some people will recommend skipping because of that, but it's not as bad as it's made out to be, and it serves as a good introduction to the series. Personally, I would recommend watching it, as it is important to the story, but feel free to drop it if you hate it.

2. Fate/Stay Night: Unlimited Blade Works (2014 Series) by Ufotable. NOT the 2007 movie by Studio Deen.

3. Fate/Stay Night: Heaven's Feel (Movie Trilogy) by Ufotable. The third one was delayed because of COVID and hasn't been released yet.

The other main entry is Fate/Zero (2011) by Ufotable, which is the prequel of Fate/Stay Night. This is where opinions differ on watch order. VN readers will tell you to watch it after all three Fate/Stay Night routes, because is explains backstory elements that were mysteries in the VN, but that watch order doesn't really work for the adaptations. Since Fate/Zero was the first one adapted by Ufotable, the mysteries of Fate/Stay Night are treated more like conclusions to plot points raised in Zero, as the studio expects viewers to have already watched Zero. You can watch Zero before or after Unlimited Blade Works, but I would recommend watching it after.

So, my recommended order is:

1. Fate/Stay Night (2006)

2. Fate/Stay Night: Unlimited Blade Works (2014)

3. Fate/Zero (2011)

4. Fate/Stay Night: Heaven's Feel (Move Trilogy)

There are also spin offs to check out as well:
Fate/Apocrypha, Fate/Grand Order, Lord El-Melloi II Case Files, and others. Feel free to check them out after you've watched the main series.

This is somewhat related, but Kara no Kyoukai is also a very good Urban Fantasy series that is set in the same universe. It can be confusing, because it is a mystery that is told out of order, and it deals with a lot of complex topics, but it's absolutely worth a watch."
Fate/stay night,"You previously wrote ""I do not get it"" regarding enjoying the serie. What do you not enjoy/like/find interesting? 

And by the way i was not really into the show at the beginning. I remember when the first season aired and i started watching it... after some episodes (like 8 - 10) i stopped because it kind of was not that interesting to me. However after a few years (s3 was ending at that moment) i decided to give it a try and got hooked on it. It was great. And now the 4th season is really fantastic and I can't wait to watch every new episode..."
Fate/stay night,"[season 3 when you find out how Eren's dad became the attack titan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvZZ_pwDsx0). the Owl briefly says ""you have to save Mikasa and Armin"". This implies that the Attack Titan (at minimum) has some sort of future sight abilities because The Owl literally states that he doesn't know who those people he mentioned are, but still requests Grisha to save them. If the attack titan has that sort of power and Zeke was a warrior candidate, The Owl would have had ample time to speak with and plan with Zeke this exact path, which sets into place the current events."
Fate/stay night,"Great explanation of the time lines! Gonna show this to my folks who are watching, but are mildly confused. 

However, you missed one of my favorite (small) details: 

Ciri and Geralt’s destinies are so intertwined that the farmer Geralt saved from ghouls actually offers him the Law of Surprise as payment. Geralt immediately refuses, but had he accepted,  Ciri would have once again been his reward.  She was what the farmer had waiting for him at home, but did not know."
Fate/stay night,"I'm Confused. I've play the games and read about the books, always believed Gerald white hair was due to a more advanced set of trials rarely given to any witcher."
Fate/stay night,"Thanks for the write up of especially the pre story lore of the world as I didn’t get all of that from the snippets of dialogue in the show.  

I do have a question, what is the valley of plenty?"
Fate/stay night,">  Geralt saves Yen by wishing for their fates to be bound together.

Do we know what he wished for?"
Fate/stay night,[deleted]
Fate/stay night,"I think you misrepresented nilfgaard a bit, in a lot of ways they are better than the north for being more advanced and not racist, however Nilfgaard does employ slave labour, slaves that are usually supplied via the wars of agression they fight, and their ""manifest destiny"" of conquering the entire continent doesn't come with just a desire for unification, but with genocide and atrocities that are pretty fucking terrible, if they don't kill people they displace them and bring in colonists from nilfgaard instead, and in Nilfgaard you get hanged by the tiniest of offenses, like speaking ill of the imperator, whereas in the northen kingdoms criticism of the kings and queens is pretty common."
Fate/stay night,"As someone who had no prior knowledge of the Witcher (other than that it existed), I felt the show did quite well in explaining itself.  It usually takes me awhile to catch on so no surprise that I didn't realize 3 seperate timelines until ep5.

That said I didn't know everything you wrote, so it's a nice little background but not entirely necessary to keep up with the show and understand what was happening.

Still, thank you for this."
Fate/stay night,"I do wish they had added a little more fun between Geralt and Jaskier. The sho presents Jaskier as an eternal pain in the ass, and it feels like Geralt just basically dislikes him. Hard to fit all that into a single season, but the way they presented it feels forced."
Fate/stay night,"Thank you so much for this. As someone new to the world, I did not find the series confusing, but I am very grateful for your short description of the background of the world. The whole Conjunction was mentioned in the show, but was not really explained. Really interesting to read about. 

I do have a few questions

> There’s frankly a pretty good case to be made that the citizens of the north would be better off if conquered by Nilfgaard, although since the protagonists are part of the small minority that wouldn’t be better off (rulers, sorceresses, witchers), they don’t see it that way. 

I am happy to read this. I actually found myself cheering for Nilfgaard in the final battle. I could not figure out if the show intentionally wanted us to see good and bad on both sides, or if the show just failed in giving me any sympathy for the North. 

Sure, Nilfgaard was portrayed as pretty bad in some areas, but the whole ""Defend our way of life in the North"" that the Brotherhood kept talking about did not convince me. Their way of life is to turn innocent girls into eels and to kill baby girls who were born at the wrong time... 

Are we supposed to see the North as the good guys and cheer for them? Or is it on purpose that the show is hinting towards Nilfgaard not being the worst side? 

Also, I was confused why Yennefer joined the battle for the Brotherhood. During the whole series she has seemed mostly focused on herself and on achieving beauty, power etc. It seemed that it came down to Tissaia saying something like ""Do it for me"". But I really do not feel the show succeeded in showing any kind of friendship or loyalty between Yenn and Tiss."
Fate/stay night,"To give you some more history about the politics of the Witcher, you need to understand the history of Poland.

Poland, itself, is a country of iterations. Going back from when people bothered recording history we see that the slavic regions have been a stopping off point for many nomadic peoples, from the goths to the Burgundy to the  Tatars, to Mongolians and Germans, and vikings and jews. No one peoples have a claim to the idea of an ethnic pure poland, as poland itself is extremely diverse set of peoples. This is analogous to the Conjunction of the Spheres, as the Elves weren't the first people in the land of the Witcher, and neither were the Dwarves, gnomes are the oldest known ""civilized"" creature in the Witcher World, but that doesn't even take into account the other ""monsters"". In this sense, the amount of monsters and different elder races and humanity living together represent the messy living situation that is the polish ethnic makeup, and how at times it can be peaceful with lots of harmony, and incredibly violent. 

Now; the Nilfgaard vs Northern Realms is something analogous so what happened in more recent history; In World War 2, Poland was being carved up by the two world superpower. The Ethnic cleansing warmongering Fascist-feudalist state that was Nazi Germany (Northern Kingdoms), and the technologically advancing mega-empire with more money and manpower than sense in the Soviet Union (Nilfgaard). Nilfgaard (Soviets) were kinder to the Elder Races (Gypsies) than the Northern Kingdoms (Nazis), so they felt that it was fight or die, while the Northern Kingdoms wanted an ethnically pure realm by ghettoizing and displacing as any of the Elderblood as possible for ""The safety of and prosperity of the Kingdom"".

This dichotomy is what leads us to the Anti-politics Geralt, who represents the post-soviet attitude of Poland that is Neo-Liberalism, the idea of free movement and a more tolerant society for the purpose of ensuring a more free, less oppressed, and more resilient Polish republic."
Fate/stay night,[deleted]
Fate/stay night,"They should have played the opening animated intro (not the CG) to Witcher 3. Briefly explains magic, the conjunction, witchers, people's attitude toward both, and touched on the wild hunt.

Fate/stay night,[removed]
Fate/stay night,"One thing I would add is that the farmer Gerlalt saved offered him the law of surprise as payment for saving his life.  The reward would then be Ciri who his daughter was taking in as a new daughter and, thus, his new granddaughter.   This further reinforces the destiny between Geralt and Ciri."
Fate/stay night,"Good write-up! Although I disagree with the decision to jump around the timelines so much, they do try and drop a few hints here and there that let you figure it out. I think the first one is when they talk about an old battle that Calanthe won, and a few scenes later we hear that she's just won it. There's also stuff like Foltest as an adult king vs. seeing him as a child. You can definitely reconstruct the timelines based on the hints, but it's really hard to do on the fly as you're trying to watch the show."
Fate/stay night,"Omg, you linked my version of the Witcher map!"
Fate/stay night,"Thank you so much for this.  I am enjoying the snow but have been relatively lost.  I don't consider myself a total idiot, either (though that's certainly a matter of opinion).  I was just thinking to myself that this show is likely much better understood by those who are already familiar with it."
Fate/stay night,"This is very well written, but I feel like the show generally explains things pretty plainly in exposition if you just pay attention."
Fate/stay night,"I never read the books or played the games, but I did still pick up on most of that stuff. However, the one thing I didn't pick up on at all is that Nilfgaard isn't actually the bad guys. 

The army clad in black armor surely had to be the horrible people. It is pretty much the trope of all movies/shows that the people in black attire are the bad guys. 

As I watched though, they never really seemed that bad. I just figured they hadn't expressed their true intentions yet. So, the whole time I was just thinking; ""what are they up to?"""
Fate/stay night,"If Nilfgaard is this advanced civilization, why does it have a leave nobody alive policy during war?  It instantly makes them look like the bad guys and somewhere else in this post it says Nilfgaard uses slaves so it’s be counterintuitive to kill everyone.  Does this have something to do specifically with Cintra or do Cintrans just think Nilfgaard is like that because they tend to dehumanize the south?"
Fate/stay night,"This is going to get me downvoted, but I don’t care. Evidently there’s something fundamentally flawed about your storytelling when fans have to write a 20+ paragraph explanation as to what’s going on. 

It’s one of my major gripes about the show - your average Netflix dude/lady isn’t going to understand the world—isn’t given enough information to—and likely isn’t going to deep dive the internet for information if they see a show that jumps around timelines and assumes you already know characters. My friends couldn’t get into it for this reason.

I like the show and hope it improves but this shouldn’t be the norm."
Fate/stay night,"It’s a shame the show needs the fans to fill in everything the show runners failed to accomplish themselves. Cavill is great, but they need to replace the writing/production team. The costumes, dialog, and soundstage feel aren’t up to snuff in 2020.

I’m worried it’s not going to get a third season with drop off of non-Witcher fans."
Fate/stay night,"If I need to read paragraphs of explanation to understand the show, did the writers do a good enough job of world building? I understand they’re not holding our hand, so to speak, but neither did GoT and it was understandable."
Fate/stay night,"Great effort, mate. Appreciated"
Fate/stay night,"The endless circlejerking for this show is so tiring now.

Saying shit like ""this show doesnt hold hands"" is some serious rick and morty level defending to excuse some pretty sub par writing/direction.

To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand the witcher."
Fate/stay night,"I rewatched it again and realized that time doesn't go back and forth. It's consistent, but it jumps for one character to catch up to the other.

Geralt starts when his legend began. Blaviken.

Yennifer starts when her legend began. The Lodge of Sorcerers.

Ciri's starts when her legend began. The Cintra massacre.

The stories don't interwove into each other yet. They show their exploits and experiences first. Time is going forward but at different points. They merge together at the end."
Fate/stay night,This is a great primer but you shouldn’t have to know all this to enjoy a TV show. It was a jumbled mess and I doubt I’ll watch season 2.
Fate/stay night,"I'm late to the game, so this will probably go unnoticed, but I'd still like to show my appreciation for this post.

My biggest complaint about the show - for someone unfamiliar with the Witcher - was how we did have no notion at all how the world worked. There is no timeframe, no location, things just happen. It felt like a small world, because I had no idea what the larger scope was.

The plot felt so convoluted and I really feel they could have used your writing on the show. 
Words like ""meanwhile"", ""northern"", etc.. can give us more information about a larger world while keeping the story focused in a monster-of-the-week routine while we follow Geralt.
Including a map would work too, exactly how you did, because it can make for much better understanding.
Great fantasy shows like ""GoT"" or ""Avatar: the Last Airbender"" even feature their map in their openings, because they know they are important for worldbuilding.

All in all, I did think it was an average to subpar fantasy show when you consider the above. This post made a lot things more clear, which I believe shouldn't have. Since a good story is clear on itself."
Fate/stay night,"Okay, this summary made way more sense than the show itself did."
Fate/stay night,"> In Nilfgaard, elves and dwarves are treated as full citizens 

Nope, that's fanfiction. Nilfgaard's internal racial relations are never addressed. Over the course of the books, we meet only 2 elves (and not a single dwarf) in the South, so it's possible they simply do not have any significant population of elves and dwarves. 

> There’s frankly a pretty good case to be made that the citizens of the north would be better off if conquered by Nilfgaard 

Again, fanfiction (aka Witcher 3). They would be dead or enslaved, since Nilfgaard's goal is to replace Nordlings with their own settlers to achieve Lebensraum (a living space). As a state, they have very little redeeming qualities. Individual Nilfgaardian characters can be nice though."
Fate/stay night,"As a person who first played the games in their release-order and who read most of the books I didn't find the timeline too hard to follow or separate after the third or so episode, and my girlfriend who watched it with me and who never played the games before also caught on to it quickly without needing my help with explaining anything.

And as much as it can be a bit confusing for the first episode or two I actually really appreciate how the story was structured since it really puts the differnce in life-span between Sorcerors/Sorceresses, Witchers and humans as a whole into sharp contrast.

While Gerald and Yennefer is effectively just dicking their way through the decades a teenage-queen becomes a mom, a granny and eventually see her kingdom razed to the ground."
Fate/stay night,My wife and I are watching the series now and were quite confused. Your timeline doesn't seem to match what we are watching.
Fate/stay night,"I know that I will get downvoted for this but if the first season of a fantasy show needs a post like this to explain it... then it is not a good show.     

I am currently watching the Dark crystal age of resistance and it has a lot of fantasy elements which are very original yet nothing that needs a lot of outside explanation if you have not seen the movie since it explains most of them as the story goes on"
Fate/stay night,"I watched it and was also mildly confused until the last two episodes. If a show needs a ""guild"" then it wasn't explained good enough in the series. Did anyone notice when a time or scene changed there was never a caption explaining the time or location? Pretty frustrating and not insightful"
Fate/stay night,"Guide or no guide, it's still an average show"
Fate/stay night,Appreciate the help!
Fate/stay night,"The thing is, this being necessary means the show failed in its job."
Fate/stay night,"Very nice explaination. Although the plotis not hard to understand by just watching, your write-up makes it better.

> Geralt broke out of Cintran captivity in the chaos, but had no idea that Ciri successfully made it out, too. Geralt, like Ciri and the Nilfgaardians, also travels north from Cintra, in his case heading for the witcher’s keep of Kaer Morhen to lick his wounds and feel sorry for himself over the whole Ciri business. He saves a travelling farmer from ghouls attracted by the bodies of Cintran refugees, but catches a nasty bite in the process. The farmer tosses Geralt in his cart to recuperate. As a wound-fevered Geralt is transported back to the farmer's house, the Battle of Sodden Hill happens close enough to be within earshot, and Yennefer (who Geralt doesn’t know is fighting in that battle) goes MIA after summoning a firestorm that stops the invasion cold.

You didn't mention the part where Geralt saw his mother. Was that a ""dream"" or was his mother actually there?"
Fate/stay night,It’s a really big indictment on the writing in the show that you’d feel like this type of thing was necessary.
Fate/stay night,This is an absurdly long post for a show that isn’t at all hard to follow
Fate/stay night,"Holy heck thank you for this write up. I watched the show and loved it though was very confused initially. I own Witcher 3 but haven’t played and have never read the books. It helped so much, especially the backstory."
Fate/stay night,Extremely helpful and well-written. Thanks!
Fate/stay night,"Thanks so much for this. I went in totally blind and this helped world-build a ton for me. I think the show is entertaining and pretty well done, but I wish this backstory would have been explained more (or better)."
Fate/stay night,Very helpful. I think if you pay attention most of this is clear in the show but this definitely helped me connect some dots. The law of surprise connection being such a strong father - daughter bond for them was not 100% clear to me before this so things make a lot more sense now.
Fate/stay night,"The wish to tie their fates together, didn't that stop the djinn because if the djinn killed Yennifer then it would have killed Geralt and a djinn cannot kill it's master?"
Fate/stay night,Fantastic writeup
Fate/stay night,"Good writeup overall, missing most of the details of Yennefer's plotline, but I can see why you left them out for clarity's sake."
Fate/stay night,[deleted]
Fate/stay night,"Super helpful. Once I realized there were more than once timeline, even for just a relatively short period of the show, I got co fused and somehow thought Renfri and Yen would end up being the same person. Like Yen would transform to Renfri which is why Renfri was a monster or something."
Fate/stay night,"Any explanation as to why Geralt's eyes turn black and face turns extra veiny looking during a fight, but he looks like a normal, painfully handsome man the rest of the time."
Fate/stay night,Saved for when in finished
Fate/stay night,Very good post
Fate/stay night,"The only thing that bothered me was the characterization of the Wizards/Sorcererers in the series. In the books and games, they are said to be the most beautiful/handsome a person can get due to magic manipulation. So they should be all Kens and Barbies, but i can udnerstand the issues of adapting that."
Fate/stay night,Thanks man this helped so much! Hopefully they have a less confusing timeline in season 2
Fate/stay night,"Thanks very much for the write up! It's nice to have some of those gaps filled in. I didn't see this asked anywhere, so apologies if this was clarified, but why was the law of surprise in one case (Duny) a marriage, but in another (Geralt/Ciri) it's protection? 

Will Geralt eventually marry Ciri when she gets older or something? The rules just seem so ambiguous for such a powerful request."
Fate/stay night,"RemindMe! One week ""Read this when you have finished the series"""
Fate/stay night,"Thanks, that is helpful. Never read books or played games but post TV series, inspired to buy and started playing Witcher 3. Already learnt lots prior to this post thanks to the game."
Fate/stay night,Save for later
Fate/stay night,Commenting to find later!
Fate/stay night,Awesome write up! Succinct and to the point. I like how you skipped over the entire forest of Brokilon arc with a single sentence :p
Fate/stay night,Bravo and thank you.  *Tosses a silver to his Witcher bard*
Fate/stay night,Question for anyone who caught this: what was vilgefortz doing at the end? He survives his battle with Cahir and then wakes up and....bashes a friendly mage's head in with a club? I was so confused.
Fate/stay night,"If they’d simply added some kind of year captions before each short story, it would’ve solved a lot of problems. Even something so basic as “X years before the War”"
Fate/stay night,Wow this was so thorough and now I know what the hell is going on with no help of wikipedia. Thank you!

He Who Cant Marry,I’ll pass. He’s homophobic.
He Who Cant Marry,"Joel bombed worse than ever at a sold out comedy show of 17,000 people in attendance. To hear 17,000 people screaming “Get the fuck off the stage!” Was really quite amazing. He responded with racist jokes(¿) that infuriated the crowd even more. He remained on stage to collect his check,but he was absolutely horribly horrific."
He Who Cant Marry,It's a dream come true for me too :')
My Love from the Star,I just loved Jun Ji Hyun's character so much <3 It's nice to see a female lead in a Korean drama who's not a wallflower and doesn't get dragged around everywhere by the arm.
My Love from the Star,"""One pregnant woman from Jiangsu, a province in eastern China, almost had a miscarriage, according to news reports, after she stayed up too many nights binge-watching and eating fried chicken and beer.""

................."
My Love from the Star,"For a much more in depth article of whats going on in the Chinese film industry, check out this article from The Economist from late last year-
http://www.economist.com/news/christmas-specials/21591741-red-carpet

The Chinese entertainment industry is a fine example of how censorship kills art.  China is a huge market for TV and Movies that the Chinese government wants locals to dominate, but they are unlikely to get there with their heavy handed censorship program.  "
My Love from the Star,"Here's a link to the first ep

http://www.viki.com/videos/1026409v-my-love-from-the-star-episode-1#

It's not bad at all -- I watched it last night.  Subtlety is not its strong point, but the narrative structure is first rate."
My Love from the Star,"Yeah, I've spent the last two months following this show religiously as it's been released. Can understand the Chinese sentiments."
My Love from the Star,"""meets an arrogant female pop star and falls in love.""

Never seen this show and yet I've watched this a million times. I've seen a lot of kdramas."
My Love from the Star,Its kind of funny to imagine officals from the second most poweful country in the world having a debate to discuss why South korea is making better shows than them
My Love from the Star,As a Korean male who watches a lot of Korean shows it gets kinda annoying that certain shows get so popular you see English subtitles already AND Chinese subtitles :/
My Love from the Star,The premise sounds a bit campy. Is it straight up drama or some type of whimsical dramedy? 
My Love from the Star,I bet it's better than Star Crossed. What a fucking horrible show that is. 
My Love from the Star,"Doesn't Hong Kong make decent TV serials? Yeah, yeah, ""hk hates the mainland""."
My Love from the Star,"you had me at Jun Ji-Hyun...  *swoon*

I didn't realize she was doing TV again."
My Love from the Star,Yeah but there are perks to being one. 
My Love from the Star,This is the primary appeal of the whole series
My Love from the Star,"It's actually a really interesting subject with some nuance. 

From ~1920-1930 Soviet cinema was some of the strongest and [most studied and emulated](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_montage_theory) in the world. Then Stalin institutes censorship programs on the arts, and you've got maybe 3 or 4 Soviet productions of note until the 70s. I can't think of any other country that has gone from so high to so low almost overnight. You can also look at the United States, which was dominated by a strict moral code for moviemaking until ~1967. That system was abolished and [quality, style, freshness, everything skyrocketed](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Hollywood). Really strong examples of censorship killing art.

Then you get to 1980, once the success of Star Wars and Jaws has demonstrated itself, and the quality starts falling again. Quality is obviously subjective, but in objective terms, the variety of stories being told drastically shrinks, and the control individual artists have over their movies is strongly limited as studios start investing in a small number of massive and globally-released blockbusters rather than a collection of smaller roadshow films. This is when sequels started becoming common -- try to find many sequels before 1980. Many directors found themselves more limited in 1985 than they had been under the Hays moral code in 1965.

The director Bela Tarr, who worked under the Stalinist MKP in Hungary for years and continues to work 20 years after its fall, has talked about this a lot. In one interview with an American radio station, he was asked whether the arts had changed since the fall of the USSR. He responded ""No -- not really. You know... What's changed is, during my youth, I had censorship of the politics. Now I have censorship of the market."" He films things today, like *Satantango*, that would have been disallowed while the MKP and USSR stood; but he points out that he would never be allowed today to film some of the things he did in the 80s, things that British and American filmmakers wouldn't have been allowed to make. 

Rod Serling (creator of *The Twilight Zone*) had a really interesting interview where he talked about these problems as well. During the 1950s and 1960s, he was at the cutting edge in more ways than one -- he wrote really well-produced, detailed, professionally-made TV productions at a time when TV was considered a child's toy, and as early as 1955 he was writing stories decrying segregation, the treatment of the mentally ill, etc. But he had a lot of problems with censorship, both of politics and of the market. His stories about traumatised soldiers witnessing chaos and violence in war were targeted for their violence, his stories about women and drug addicts were targeted for their supposed immorality. But he was also unable to write stories referring to the Holocaust, because gas oven manufacturers advertised heavily on TV networks and didn't want negative mentions of gas made. Similarly he was not allowed to make a show dealing with cancer with a cigarette company as his sponsor, wasn't allowed to cast a black lead because it'd alienate his white audience, and had all sorts of other limitations introduced by the market outside of direct state censorship.

So there's no place or system you can operate under right now that doesn't have major limitations, and looking at the different kinds of limitations that can appear is actually really interesting.

"
My Love from the Star,"That in-movie user commentary is hilarious, totally ruining it for me.  It's like an ad-hoc MST3k."
My Love from the Star,"You know, I kinda like it.

The only kdrama I know is Coffee Prince, which can be soo aggravating to watch."
My Love from the Star,not available in my region
My Love from the Star,"Korean Dramas are straight up soap operas full of people getting cancer, car accidents, funerals, pathetically crying in regret, two unexpected people falling in love, their parents disapproving of their choices, and finally someone getting amnesia.

Along with everyone looking like a model."
My Love from the Star,It's more akin to the teen dramas you see on the CW or ABC family or something. Those guilty pleasure shows. This particularly show has a lot of humor that draws fans in
My Love from the Star,"I didn't notice that.  Are you talking about them explaining the mocha/cottonseed goof she made?  Non-Korean speakers wouldn't have understood it.

I got it that she said something stupid, but still had to google it:

http://www.dramabeans.com/2013/12/you-from-another-star-episode-1/"
My Love from the Star,"I think he's talking about the real time comments for the video. They're done similarly to soundcloud where you can comment on a specific time in the video. It is pretty funny to watch. 

My favorite instance of this was when the first trailer for the 3rd Evangelion movie came out, the only link to it had user comments ALL OVER the video like throughout the screen not just a corner that you can turn off. Seeing people's thoughts line up all at once is pretty funny. "
My Love from the Star,"Oh that banner at the top?  I remember seeing that but turned it off -- I couldn't figure out what was going on.

Was that from people watching it at the time I was watching it last night or a replay of those watching live"
My Love from the Star,"It was just comments people left. Kind of like regular youtube comments but every one is timestamped so you see the comment when the action the commenter is referring to is shown on the screen. Such as them talking about her ""Sorry, Sorry"" thing right after she said it. "
My Love from the Star,"Gotcha.

BTW what was up with the sorry, sorry line?  Do Koreans say that?"
My Love from the Star,"No idea. I'm pretty sure they have their own word for it so I don't really know why she'd say it in engrish other than comedic effect. 

I don't really watch Korean comedy that much, mainly their revenge/action movies so I'm unfamiliar with their humor beats. "
My Love from the Star,"I think it could be a reference to a popular k-pop song: [Sorry, Sorry by Super Junior](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6QA3m58DQw)?"
My Love from the Star,it's one of her trademarks. she pronounces sorry in english throughout the series in an exaggerated and incorrect way
My Love from the Star,"To my American ears, it did sound like she was using a hardcore Chicago accent. She'd be fine at after, say, spilling a beer at a Cubs game. 

Thanks for the context!"
My Love from the Star,Imagine your industry being so shit that Twitch is the less toxic environment.
My Love from the Star,"Grace Van Dien:
>“Here’s the thing, I have seen that some people are upset with me for turning down acting projects and deciding to stream more, but the fact of the matter is the last few projects I’ve worked on I didn’t have the best experiences with some of the people I had to work for,” Van Dien said.

>She then alleged that a film producer made unwanted sexual advances toward her on set.

>“One of the last movies I did, one of the producers asked me to… like, he hired a girl that he was sleeping with and then he had her ask me to have a threesome with them,” Van Dien said. “So… that’s my boss. And then I didn’t and I cried and I was so upset. But when people are like, ‘How is streaming better for your mental health?’ That’s how. I get to stay inside my house and play video games and I don’t have my boss asking me to have sex with them.”

>Van Dien added that though she’s sticking to streaming for now, she hopes to get back into show business soon — and on her own terms.

>“I’m happy here, and I’m developing my own projects,” she said. “I’m hoping that someone decides to fund them because then I can be in control of my own set, and I’m not gonna ask my actors to sleep with me.”"
My Love from the Star,That’s fucked but at least she’s still able to do something lucrative and didn’t have to throw it all away to avoid being Weinsteined
My Love from the Star,Scumbags are getting too comfortable again as time passes the Weinstein stuff. Time to nip that shit in the bud.
My Love from the Star,who was she on stranger things?
My Love from the Star,"This person clearly forgot that her father is Johnny f'n Rico. 

So frustrating to hear things like this. Like the money you get from existing in the producer-tier of the film industry isn't enough? You also have to torment your talent?"
My Love from the Star,Hollywood is full of some really dark shit and it’s getting really hard to see past it.
My Love from the Star,"I may be naive, but her dad is Casper Van Dien. I would think having a fairly famous dad would be the best kind of nepotism: insulation against those dirty fucking movie execs."
My Love from the Star,She should name the projects and producers.
My Love from the Star,"She'd rather stream on Twitch playing games than work in Hollywood. And I say good for her, her health and safety are more important. Fuck Hollywood and the sexual predator scum that run the industry"
My Love from the Star,"Was so mesmerizing in the few scenes she had in ST, such a shame there are so many shitty people who take advantage of nice people like Grace.

Edit for all of the people arguing about this in the comments: I took her task to be difficult because she only had one episode to make the audience feel sympathy and care for her enough to be the whole impetus of the season, basically.  And I think she did a great job with it."
My Love from the Star,"Good for her! Honestly though it's so fucking sickening and at the same time unsurprising that there was a whole cultural moment a few years ago about exactly this sort of behavior and yet there's still just so much rot. Hollywood is morally bankrupt, and I don't blame any young women for not wanting to associate with that cesspool."
My Love from the Star,Good for her.
My Love from the Star,That fucking sucks nobody deserves to go through that. I’m happy she has streaming as something that she does. Don’t usually give two shits about famous ppl or celebs but that’s just Down right shitty. Do your thing young lady and fuck these Hollywierd ppl and their horrible practices! Hopefully somebody does fund one of her projects bc she sounds like somebody who has a future in helping make sure her cast and crew are safe and protected!
My Love from the Star,It's totally bullshit that with film unions and guilds that Producers can keep their job after such disgusting behavior.
My Love from the Star,">“One of the last movies I did, one of the producers asked me to… like, he hired a girl that he was sleeping with and then he had her ask me to have a threesome with them,” Van Dien said. “So… that’s my boss. And then I didn’t and I cried and I was so upset. But when people are like, ‘How is streaming better for your mental health?’ That’s how. I get to stay inside my house and play video games and I don’t have my boss asking me to have sex with them.”

Just one of the many benefits of working remotely."
My Love from the Star,"Chrissy wake up!

On a serious note, good for her by not compromising her morals to advance her career."
My Love from the Star,NPR just did a story about how conditions in the entertainment industry are basically back to pre me too. Large companies hired experts to help them change but just used them as shields whenever concerns were raised. All outward change was purely performative.
My Love from the Star,Chrissy woke up!!!
My Love from the Star,"I gotta say, for one of the most unioned up industries in this country, they do fucking fuck all when shit like this comes up."
My Love from the Star,"Harvey Weinstein was just the tip, the whole industry is fucked"
My Love from the Star,So in other words nothing has changed at all?!
My Love from the Star,That’s awful. Hopefully she can find some projects without any sex pests. I was impressed with her on Stranger Things. She really elevated what could have been a typical mean-girl cheerleader tropey character.
My Love from the Star,"On another note, it just hit me that her dad is Johnny Rico from Starship Troopers, Casper Van Dien. My mind is blown that he has a 26 y/o daughter, but it makes sense."
My Love from the Star,I wish some of these women would be more Ellen Barkin-like and say names when they talk of these things.
My Love from the Star,Good that she knows her worth and kudos to her for sharing what happened
My Love from the Star,What is it with Hollywood and the total inability to not be a creep?
My Love from the Star,Wow that sucks. But at least she can get some joy out of streaming
My Love from the Star,Out that boss - hollywood still full of assholish men treating women like shit.
My Love from the Star,Stranger things star? She was in like one episode
My Love from the Star,"No relation to Casper van Dien, is there?"
My Love from the Star,“Star” is used pretty loosely these days eh
My Love from the Star,Her twitch handle is BlueFille. I couldn't find it in the article.
My Love from the Star,"More power too her. She’s doing her part!

She was good in Stranger Things, her role was small but complex and her performance was memorable. I’ll miss seeing more from her but she doesn’t owe us her talent. She owes herself her happiness."
My Love from the Star,"I love that she not only didn't cave to the pressure, but called it out. She can't name the man because he'll bury her financially in litigation, but she can make it known that she's experienced what we all know the industry does and that other women don't have to accept it either."
My Love from the Star,"I don't want to in any way downplay the inappropriate sexual situations she was exposed to, but this article really exaggerated and overplayed her role in Stranger Things.  She was in part of one episode... Not exactly ""the breakout star"" they claimed

Jazzing up the story is not how journalism is done"
My Love from the Star,What’s sad is after everything the last few years these abusers in Hollywood can still get away with it and keep doing this awful shit to more people. I’d like to think we live in a world where they can’t hide anymore. I wish she could name this person but I get why she can’t. I feel for her.
My Love from the Star,Didnt know she was Johnny Rico's daughter.
My Love from the Star,Had no idea this was Casper Van Dien's kid.
My Love from the Star,"Understandable, have a great day"
My Love from the Star,It’s horrible that so many industries are operated this way and not enough people put their foot down and expose it.
My Love from the Star,Johnny Rico doesn't like this
My Love from the Star,Why can’t people just go to work and do their job instead of trying to sleep with people / sexually harass or assault those they work with?
My Love from the Star,name names. burn that cesspool to the ground
My Love from the Star,Y’all should watch the movie “she said” came out late last year and is about Harvey Weinstein and that New York Times article. Really begs the question of how many other Harveys are out there?
My Love from the Star,"I feel so bad for her. She's been bullied by people who are obsessed with Joseph Quinn (Eddie from Stranger Things) too, because they are friends.

I hope things look up for her."
My Love from the Star,"Amuzing people are still dubious of potential repercussions if she spoke out more, considering the trash she's already getting in this cesspool of a thread, entirely from people with no stakes in the matter."
My Love from the Star,"She was only in 3 episodes, how is she a “star”?"
My Love from the Star,Name them!
My Love from the Star,"Stranger Things *Star*? I watched it and don’t even remember her character, let alone know who she is."
My Love from the Star,Wait… that jawline. I just realized she’s Rico’s daughter.
My Love from the Star,No idea who this is
My Love from the Star,Hollywoods gunna Hollywood
My Love from the Star,"Common Hollywood L 

Wish more actors and actresses were strong enough to call out all the predators

Sadly doing so puts their career and money at risk"
My Love from the Star,"A producer asked his girlfriend to ask Grace if she would like to have a threesome. 

She decided not to. Then cried about it. Then left 

What a load of overblown hysterics."
My Love from the Star,"""star"""
My Love from the Star,Back in the day that would have gotten you blacklisted from movies. Hopefully this isn’t still the case.
My Love from the Star,"I didn't know she streamed and I thought I'd check it out, but she has no archived past broadcasts or anything at all eh?"
My Love from the Star,It is unfortunate when an industry becomes known for having a toxic environment. It is important for all industries to prioritize creating safe and respectful spaces for everyone.
My Love from the Star,"Waiting for the usual suspects to attack and vilify her for daring to speak out against an abusive man, the way they have for other women over the last four years. Claiming it was their fault they were abused, or that they were the ones abusing the men."
My Love from the Star,Hollywood never cleaned up after Harvey obv
My Love from the Star,"One horrible takeaway from all of this is that too much of this comes down to “talent”. 

The producers with “talent” get away with this shit behavior while the many victims have to hope they’re “talented” enough to be heard. 

Super mature move out of her to acknowledge how toxic that is instead of suffering."
My Love from the Star,"Inaccurate title: ‘Stranger Things’ Star

‘Stranger Things’ Actor more like it - she's in 1 episode, and 2 flashbacks (uncredited)

Regardless - why is this still happening? Did Hollywood ignore the Harvey Weinstein crap"
My Love from the Star,[removed]
My Love from the Star,Why is the industry that prides itself on moralizing to the world is actually the most racist and sexist hive of villainy?
My Love from the Star,hows this still happening after weinstein?
My Love from the Star,"I always find it interesting when people in America express such sexually liberal views, and then something like this comes up people act as though the employee and worker relationship is somehow sacred. 

She is an attractive and semi-notable young actress, who must receive attention from many men, especially as a streamer. Is the only reason for this being news and outrage-worthy the fact that her boss tried to get his way with her? 

Perhaps it’s the power dynamic people find offensive. They picture a helpless and naive young woman, and a strong older man who aims to take advantage of her. However, the woman in question is well of age, so is this really anybody’s business other than her own?

Surely we wouldn’t mean to patronize the young woman, who is obviously more than capable of rejecting someone’s advances on her own, without the aid and outrage of the thoughtful Reddit community."

""Star"""
At-Home Dad,"There's a great character on Parenthood that's a stay at home dad. It's not seen as something to be ashamed of, and the shows story addresses it in a way that is grounded and realistic. Check it out. "
At-Home Dad,"I feel there's a certain prejudice against stay-at-home dads, this perception that men who do it are either ""lazy"" (why can't he go out and be the breadwinner?) or ""enmasculated"" (he cleans and cooks! What a freak!). Both, of course, are quite wrong.

"
At-Home Dad,"Well there is one at Lilyhammer but hes in siderole (kinda)
But this show is rather outlier and potrays to live of Norwegian people and i guess in Scandinavian culture ""Stay at home dad"" is more common than in other parts of western world"
At-Home Dad,"In that NBC show *Up All Night*, Will Arnett's character was a stay-at-home dad."
At-Home Dad,"Good question. My best friend basically is one. He brings in money doing gigs and fixing instruments, but his wife has the 9-to-5."
At-Home Dad,I think it has less to do with the networks and more to do with the public. Stay at home dads are looked down on in the US. 
At-Home Dad,"Tv tends to really cling to gender roles and stay at home fathers go against that, and going against the norm is usually lazy comedy. I watched Nashville and the father was kind of a stay at home dad in that the mother toured and he stayed home with the kids, but I think he had a job. I think I saw some second or third tier comedy that did it, but they pretty much used it to make the wife=man and the husband=woman jokes that fit with the overall quality of the show. Cam in Modern Family was for a few seasons and I thought they handled it reasonably well with how he felt about it.


I watched what I think was the first episode of Rizzoli and Isles, the going against type but actually a cliche character was all cringe worthy about a male nurse and I still remember face palming over it. Fuck, have some critical thinking skills, writers."
At-Home Dad,"I feel like this topic is getting explored more and more lately. The main reason is times are changing.

Right now I am really enjoying the Mindy Project this season due to a samiler matter. Over the past couple of episodes they been exploring rather or not if the main character should SHAM. There's pressure from her SO to be a ""traditional"" family. I love that they are exploring this. My favorite bit was when the character asked if her SO was willing to do the same of which he asking her to do. 

A somewhat of an off topic but the subject I brought up with anyone I dated. I grew up with both parents working ( although my dad did random spurts of being a SAHD due to unemployment). If I wasn't childfree and choose to have kids I would work because I find it to be a good ideal for both to work.  "
At-Home Dad,Sounds awesome. Let me check my Netflix. 
At-Home Dad,It is not on my Netflix. I am a sad person.
At-Home Dad,"I'm not a stay at home dad but I was recently admonished by a coworker because I mentioned I was tired from getting up in the night to change my two month old daughter's diaper. According to her, that was my wife's job and I should refuse to do it.

For some reason some people don't want dads to be dads."
At-Home Dad,"This prejudice does exist. My hope is that by portraying stay at home dads in a positive light, perhaps the prejudice can lighten or, optimistically, go away. "
At-Home Dad,"I haven't watched all that much of it (yet, I think I might go back to it at some point) but I liked that about it. And from what I've seen it's not a huge deal for the characters. It's not the point of the series, it's just the way things are for these people. "
At-Home Dad,Which is very unfortunate. 
At-Home Dad,I'm also watching The Mindy Project. It's one of the reasons I made the post (since I'm rather hoping Danny pulls his head out of his ass and becomes a SAHD).
At-Home Dad,Note that although he's the more nurturing parent his being a stay at home parent was not fully his choice but partially a consequence of lack of construction work and his wife's higher paying lawyer job.
At-Home Dad,"Oh, sorry. It's on American Netflix, so I can't help you there. "
At-Home Dad,[deleted]
At-Home Dad,"My observation is that Men see them as weak or as failures (why else would they end up at home?), and women see them as weak,not masculine and therefore unattractive. 

I am speaking in generalizations of course. I personally don't have a problem with someone making that choice, but I wouldn't make it. I find being a breadwinner too fulfilling. "
At-Home Dad,I hope so to in a way. It was nice seeing Danny's mom agreeing with Mindy. I do think we'll see them sperated for a bit with her learning on Jordy but together at the end with a compromise. When they showed her making measurements as to rather or not Leo's crib would fit in the closest it showed how much stronger she has become. Especially with standing for what she felt was the right thing for her family. 
At-Home Dad,Surely though that's often the deciding factor in which parent does 'stay at home' rather than it being the case that one of the parents wants to and the other doesn't. 
At-Home Dad,"Yeah, UK user here. One day maybe."
At-Home Dad,"Em, what? 

It's just unfortunate that people look down on stay at home dad's. That's all. "
At-Home Dad,"Very true, Mindy had grown into a very strong person.

Have you read the Christmas Carol theory someone posted on the subreddit?"
At-Home Dad,"You can find every single episode streamed online, though. 

Google ""Parenthood S1E1 and so on and so forth and there you go. "
At-Home Dad,"No, I haven't. Can you link it?"
At-Home Dad,[Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/themindyproject/comments/3voe7p/anyone_else_think_spoilers_maybe/) we go.
At-Home Dad,"This was like if someone fed a bot a list of sitcom clichés and made it shat out a script.


There was no real personality, selfish characters for no good reason. 

Stopped watching after the second episode"
At-Home Dad,"King Bach still out here trying to make the acting thing work lol. 

Premiere was alright. As a reformed sneaker head, i appreciate it (Seeing bach argue with the reseller, the hype beast asian rocking all supreme gear and cutting the line - this show was made by folks who get it lol)"
At-Home Dad,All the characters are way over the top and none of them are likeable. Young teenagers might like it.
At-Home Dad,Trailer reminded me of a less dramatic How To Make It in America. Anyone checked it out yet?
At-Home Dad,Call me crazy but I actually enjoyed this a lot. Was pretty funny and the characters were great.
At-Home Dad,This looks terrible. Won't be surprised when it get cancelled after 1 season.
At-Home Dad,"Such a frustrating show, characters are so challenging to ""root for"" or like. It was good to have  on while i was dungeon grinding in WoW though haha.

&#x200B;

3/10 funny

8/10 background show.. 

Perfect netflix and chill show,.

zero way you'll get ""Distracted by a good part."" Because there are none LOL"
At-Home Dad,"Its watchable but not funny ,the acting is beyond cringe and the story doesnt make sense most of the time"
At-Home Dad,Saw all 6 episodes. In summary: It was *okay* but I'm not recommending it.
At-Home Dad,"I had a great time with it.  I agree, it was enjoyable, the characters were very funny.  It could have dragged on but wrapping it up in 6 episodes was just right."
At-Home Dad,"I actually liked it too. Not something that is Emmy amazing, but it's entertaining enough."
At-Home Dad,Hi crazy
At-Home Dad,"Very silly show, loved it :D"
At-Home Dad,I’ve no idea how this even got made. I’ll be super surprised if this is not quickly cancelled.
At-Home Dad,"The story wraps up so I don't expect there will be a part 2 and the ""series"" is only 6 episodes long.  I enjoyed it."
At-Home Dad,"It's only 6 episodes and the story wraps up at the end.  I guess they could write ""new adventures"" for them but there's nowhere to go with the current story."
At-Home Dad,"I don’t think this premise has aged well. Sure, in the 80s the idea of a stay at home dad was basically ridiculous. Not really the case anymore though. 

As an aside - wouldn’t Mr. Mom just be...Dad?"
At-Home Dad,"I watched the first two free episodes; not bad. It had some charm and I'd probably watch it free on broadcast TV but I'm not going to pay.

The 11 minute length is odd. The first episode doesn't really have an ending but just flows into the next 11 minutes.

Sorry, Vudu."
At-Home Dad,"FWIW, I’ve now heard of Vudu for the first time today so that’s a victory."
At-Home Dad,This is Sylvester Stallone's break out role!  ¿

At-Home Dad,[deleted]
At-Home Dad,"I like the concept of 30 minute dramas like Homecoming and Cobra Kai, but an 11 minute TV show? Are people's attention spans really getting that bad?"
At-Home Dad,Why? It’s a huge hit
At-Home Dad,"It's crazy to me how poorly they do of advertising their service. Barely anybody seems to know it exists. I use it pretty much every day, but I'm not surprised if no one really knows about it."
At-Home Dad,He's been a father for years but has no experience managing a household or taking care of children! Hilarious!
At-Home Dad,"That's *Man With a Plan*. Completely different show. Yeah, they're both about stay-at-home dads, but they have completely different styles of comedy from what I've seen (I'm a fan of neither)."
At-Home Dad,"It’s fascinating that things have changed so quickly, agreed. But I meant more that this concept for a show just isn’t made for this generation. That time has come and gone. It’s like if they recreated All in the Family today - it was acceptable at the time but certainly isn’t today.

Or maybe it would be a hit in the States, given who the President is."
At-Home Dad,"Well no they don't. Looking back at how things were is interesting. The problem is doing an outdated thing now. That's weird.

This concept is interesting because ""oh, this is how male parenting was seen in the 80's. Here's the stereotypes we held back then"". Those things in a modern show/movie are a problem.

Same reason bimbo characters are fun in old movies now simply for looking at how absurd and offensive they could be towards women being sex positive and simultaneously strong people. But a modern show with a poorly written woman is not good."
At-Home Dad,11 minute shows have been around for years on Adult Swim. Spent my teenage years watching them
At-Home Dad,Dunno about how bad 10 - 15 minute shows are in general but IMO State of the Union was a good show that made it work
At-Home Dad,"You're talking about two completely different style of ""comedies"". AitF would have difficulty nowadays. So much of it came from Caroll O'Connors rude, & blunt character that of course many would object to today. Mr Mom was hilarious, & still can be for the spouse who hasn't a clue about what the other spouse goes through. The only rude part is that people think being a stay at home parent is easy & proceed to demean it. Plus like the other poster, many of us don't appreciate the style of our president."
At-Home Dad,">Does Randall as a Black man have to end up with Beth? Did the writers make that his only choice, because lingering social taboos makes its hard to depict a leading Black man with a White woman on TV/film? Or being raised by a White family, was he attracted to Beth because he felt a sense of kinship he was missing?

Randall was attracted to a black college because, being raised by a White family, he felt a sense of kinship he was missing that he found at Howard. Where he met Beth. "
At-Home Dad,"I certainly don't hate the show.  In fact, I think is a quality production.  But yes, it's too sappy.  When I finally determined that the entire intent of the show is extract an emotional response (primarily sadness) then I lost interest.  I think I made it through the first 6 episode before dropping it."
At-Home Dad,"Ummmm... I'm attracted to Beth, and I am white. Very white. I make Johnny Winter look deeply tanned."
At-Home Dad,"I actually find it charming. In an era where television has embraced too much nihilism it’s refreshing to see a show that manages to create good drama without it. Plus does anyone else love how it constantly subverts tropes and expectations?

For instance:

Jack is going to be like all the other flawed males in Drama and cheat on his wife. Nope!

Kevin’s drug problem is going to last the whole season and cause him to go past the point of no return. Nope! 

Jack is going to die in that fire. Holy shit he survived it!

  

The only problem is that now we’ve all stated to expect the sunshine and rainbows subversions so they’ve become predictable when they’ve tried avoid such a thing."
At-Home Dad,"Well Randall went to a historically black university where I believe he met Beth. He did date a redhead in the Pittsburgh suburbs. Randall and Beth are my favorite couple, and I love their daughters. Excited for the flash forward with them! "
At-Home Dad,"Emotionally manipulative is a pretty apt way of characterizing the show.  I don't get why they need to be squeezing every ounce of blood from the stone when a character has feelings. The music, the lens flare, the silhouette shots in the late afternoon sun, just my take on it but it seems about as subtle as a hammer. "
At-Home Dad,I think it is underrated. It is well directed and edited in my opinion. It tries to make people emotional but much of it is earned. The characters emotional presents is believable when you know their trials and tribulations of the past.
At-Home Dad,"Yeah, it's just like a daytime soap opera."
At-Home Dad,"> Does Randall as a Black man *have* to end up with Beth? 

That's Sterling's wife in real life, so clearly they've got some chemistry. You will see more about his upbringing in later episodes in season one that explore his experience being a black kid in an all white environment. It makes total sense that he would marry a black woman. Also it's fucking hilarious that you're bitching about diversity and then ask why he didn't marry a white woman. WTF?"
At-Home Dad,You're not allowed to have that opinion. 
At-Home Dad,"So this is us is a soap opera,  Soap operas do very well tradionally. I catch episodes here and there, the super bowl episode.  no spoilers. I mean there are worse shows.  

Addiction plays a huge part of the show.

I assume people who grew up with an alcoholic have a special attraction to this is us.  Its not for everyone. If you don't like its cool.  I love Game of Thrones, some people think I am stupid, that's ok too. Everyone is entitled to their opinion."
At-Home Dad,This post just pointedly asked me if I assumed its gender.
At-Home Dad,My wife tried to get me to watch this with her.  I saw down and watched 2 mins of the first episode and knew this show would suck.  I quit watching it and said she was on her own.  There are plenty of signs early on that this is crap.
At-Home Dad,It's emotionally manipulative romance porn. 
At-Home Dad,I've never even seen it and I know I would hate it.
At-Home Dad,"I hate this post so much. I hate it so very much.  I don't know why we need it about *every* television show ever.  You don't like a thing that many other people like.  Neither you or all the other people are wrong, you just enjoy different things.  Just watch something else."
At-Home Dad,It’s absolutely terrible.
At-Home Dad,There’s a whole category of films & movies that tell you if someone has terrible taste but mistakenly thinks otherwise. “This is Us” and “The Notebook” are categorically definitive of this. True trash for people who can’t tell the difference between filet mignon and feces smeared on bread
At-Home Dad,"Yes! Finally! Thank you! What a melodramatic cliche piece of garbage. Every character is cliche flawed we get it. Does every fuckin episode have to be so disgustingly dramatic and sappy? It makes my skin crawl to have to watch these neurotic people react to the shit end of life for 45 mins a week when reality is already so god damn depressing. I don't find it entertaining at all. In real life I react to tragedy with dark humor and a grounded sense of realism. There is none of that in this show. It's not particularly well written or original and just constantly jams generational sadness down your throat with no reprieve. The characters are static and any growth happens in flashbacks so the character have no opportunity to grow from the past and neither does the audience. I've lost all empathy for this fuckin pack of losers. The bar was set so low for this show from the beginning that I have 0 hope for any improvement at this point. My wife watches it and so I therefore I am subjected to it but I often tune out and surf my phone. Often in relation to how fuckin dumb this show is. I appreciate there's now a reddit that I can fully vent my feelings on this garbage. 

Milo, loved pathology and Heroes. Go back to smoking meth and committing murder or saving the planet. That mustache is ridiculous!"
At-Home Dad,"If you like this show, you don't have enough of your own problems..."
At-Home Dad,"Not just emotionally manipulative but it's a crutch. A better show gets you emotionally invested based on the quality of its writing, acting, and directing. This feels like it's using every other tool in the toolbox to try to get you there."
At-Home Dad,"We are constantly bombarded with their past. There is no growth from that point. They're all stuck in these ridiculous loops of generational trauma. Thats not enough to derive a whole season of plot... let alone an entire show. We get it. She's fat, he's a token black guy, dad was an alcoholic, mom never moved on, bro is shallow and a drunk and mommy never let me dance anymore... Do we really have to just watch these people play out their past trauma and call it entertaining? It's bloody exhausting..."
At-Home Dad,">That's Sterling's wife in real life, so clearly they've got some chemistry. You will see more about his upbringing in later episodes in season one that explore his experience being a black kid in an all white environment. It makes total sense that he would marry a black woman. Also it's fucking hilarious that you're bitching about diversity and then ask why he didn't marry a white woman. WTF?

That is not Sterling's wife in real life. But they two do look similar. "
At-Home Dad,"He's married to Ryan Bathe, who plays Yvette in Season 1.

Let me ask you then how many shows or movies depict a strong nonwhite male getting with a white woman?  It's still very much in the minority.  Look at the couples pairing on the show and tell me that it's not a bit odd for optics:  In cities as diverse as NYC or LA, you have the white woman getting with the white man, the black man getting with the black woman, and almost nothing in between, which is ridiculous.  Everybody stays in a single lane.  Miguel's literally the only Latino worth giving a damn about in the whole show...which is set in Los Angeles.  "
At-Home Dad,"I'm sorry if I went off on the show there, but it's just really alarming to me for people to talk up the show and not notice such glaring issues in the writing or the optics with what type of characters they choose to portray and how they portray them.

After being stuck in binge mode with my peeps, I lost my damn mind."
At-Home Dad,">My wife tried to get me to watch this with her.  I saw down and watched 2 mins of the first episode and knew this show would suck.  I quit watching it and said she was on her own.  There are plenty of signs early on that this is crap.

You are truly missing out. "
At-Home Dad,"you're not missing out, it's crap ;)"
At-Home Dad,"You ain't missing shit. It's melodramatic cliche garbage that uses a loop of flashbacks and generational trauma as an excuse for no plot or character development. The whole show is stereotypical adults overcoming the drama of their past without any real life present concerns that are not somehow tied back to their own drama. I'd rather catch venereal disease, a treatable on of course, than watch this show again..."
At-Home Dad,"I hate *this* comment so much. This is a place to discuss shows. Discussion isn't just ""I love this show"" it also includes ""I am indifferent"" or ""I don't like it"" 

If you don't care for discussion why do you bother coming in threads that you know you're not going to like. Move on to the ones saying how much they love the shows you love. "
At-Home Dad,The constant use of flashbacks creates this unending cycle of generational trauma that is supposed to act as character development but it just acts to justify where the characters are at now. We see no growth beyond that. Everything goes back to their past. That's weak story telling because they just add more and more adversity based on those same themes. Nothing new is ever explored just recycled drama that's emotionally poignant enough to catch the attention of your average slack jawed soap watcher...
At-Home Dad,Omg my bad! I knew his wife appeared on the show and I totally got them confused. Although still he is really great opposite Susan.
At-Home Dad,">how many shows or movies depict a strong nonwhite male getting with a white woman? 

*Grey's Anatomy* did it for a long time with Jackson (Jesse Williams) & April (Sarah Drew), but a new showrunner came in this season and re-paired all the black characters with black characters and all the white characters with white characters, and fired Sarah Drew (after 9 seasons) so fans would stop pushing for that interracial pairing. "
At-Home Dad,The white son whose name I forget is with Beth's black cousin in the flash forward. I don't think this show lacks diversity.
At-Home Dad,"Dude you fine, its summer, I got one more episode of Westworld, then I will be struggling to find something. We good.  You just don't like soap operas.  I used to have a gf in 2008, made me watch Brothers and Sisters, it was awful.  "
At-Home Dad,"It's never a discussion, though.  It's one person so desperate for attention that they find popular things to shit on so that people who like the popular thing get angry and show up to yell at them."
At-Home Dad,They were friends in college or something like that. So they still known each other for a while. 
At-Home Dad,Maybe where YOU live
At-Home Dad,"I'm not desperate for attention, I'm trying to point out the hypocrisy of a show many on here adore:  The show's entire underlying premise is to have diversity and be inclusive, and even goes far as to be rewarded for it by the industry and award judges...when it's really doing nothing of the sort.  *This is Us* missed the basics.  It excludes wide demographics of people in cities that have the largest numbers of those demographics.  If the show stayed in Pittsburgh, or had present parts that were set in the middle of Memphis, Milwaukee, St. Louis or something, I honestly wouldn't care.  In essence, the show's supposed far-reaching diversity is puddle deep in depth and significance, yet people go on and on about it like the red sea was just parted in front of them.

There's shows that practice this goal yet don't receive the same amount of love for their efforts.  *Brooklyn Nine-Nine.  Lost.  The Good Place.  Westworld.*  *Breaking Bad.*  *Community.*  *The Expanse.*  *Into the Badlands.  The Walking Dead.*

I could on with shows that do a great job being diverse and inclusive with the cast and character stories, but the difference is they don't toot their own horn about it."
At-Home Dad,"No him and Lois are going to Argo where him and the baby won't have super powers so the baby wont kick a hole thru Lois' stomach. (Easter Egg Kevin Smith called that out in Mallrats).

I don't know how the baby would have powers tho since in utero it cant actually absorb the Sun's rays. Unless it's not the Sun's rays but radiation."
At-Home Dad,My bet is that the famous Superman holding supergirl’s body cover from the comic crisis will Ben reversed in the show.
Afro Samurai,bro you need to proof read your shit...
Afro Samurai,"I think I agree with you, but this was hard to read."
Afro Samurai,"lmao it looks like your grammar might kill the discussion but I do agree with you

it was pretty boring and the story was basic to the point where it didn't feel like it had a point and all of the fantasy elements didn't add much value imo

it's like the American writers just threw in all the ""cool"" anime tropes they could think of since they had the opportunity to do so

just an overall disappointment"
Afro Samurai,"Dude. Your grammar and sentence structure is abysmal. 

I teach high school English and these sentences sometimes just don’t make sense. 

I get what you are going for and the basic gist, but this was very difficult to read. You should go back and proofread and clean it up.

The first sentence alone is a clusterfuck.

“Yasuke sucks ass for reason the show more about Sami than yasuke, developments rush as shit due to short episodes.”

Like I said, I got the gist of.  But man…That was straining to read.

Edit: fixed my grammar mistake"
Afro Samurai,Nah I'm good
Afro Samurai,How
Afro Samurai,"> I teach high school English

> **I get what you are going for and the basic gist** but **this was very difficult to read** and **you should go back and proofread and clean it up**.

I'm fine with people not being grammatically correct, but that's a run-on sentence in a comment criticizing someone's grammar after telling them you teach English."
Afro Samurai,I'm hoping English isn't your first language...
Afro Samurai,Touché. I did not use correct punctuation. I shall admit my fault. Good on you!
Afro Samurai,"Yup, but I have done this structure before haven't got any issues outside Reddit."
Afro Samurai,definitely proof read your work. it's awful to read.
Afro Samurai,"damn, this list is more useful than I thought lol. Definitely missing a 'High school or Teen comedy' category though.

also, change 'Crashing' to 'Crashing (US)'. Can't be forgetting about Pheobe Waller-Bridge's underrated masterpiece **Crashing** just yet. "
Afro Samurai,"Ash vs Evil Dead, not an outright comedy but very funny and continues on the Evil Dead franchise

Son of Zorn, only had one season but very original idea about an animated 80s He-Man style dad and his human family

The Grinder, cancelled after one season but incredibly underrated. Rob Lowe plays an actor from a family of lawyers who moves back home to work with them

Mike Tyson Mysteries. An animated show starring Mike Tyson (Tyson also provides the actual voice) and his gang as they go around solving mysteries Scooby-Doo style. High concept meets lowbrow humour

New Girl, ensemble sitcom about a girl moving in with three guys. A bit in the vein of Brooklyn Nine-Nine

Trailer Park Boys. Canadian sitcom that on the surface is about three guys committing petty crimes and doing drugs but deep down a show with a lot of heart

Brockmire. Hank Azaria playing a washed up baseball announcer who moves to a small town to rejuvenate his career"
Afro Samurai,"There are some clear British snubs on this list:

**Frisky Dingo** for fans of Archer (and maybe even Pacific Heat even though it's not very good).

Nice list!!

Ooh, and **The Guestbook** for workplace, romantic, adventure comedies.  I think this show made me laugh more than anything else last year.

I miss **Triptank**. Sadly cancelled :("

Afro Samurai,"This list should absolutely include the British series ""2012"" (office comedy, about an inept team organizing the London 2012 Olympics) and it's insane sequel ""W1A"" (two characters from 2012 start working for the BBC as clueless consultants). IMHO some of the situations in both of those series reach The Office-levels of good (and cringe). 

There is an spirit animal for those two series in the Australian ""Dreamland"" too (a team works at the office of the Nation Building Authority, a new government org where is impossible to get anything done)."

Atelier,"Hi! I watched it a few years ago and I enjoyed it a lot, but can’t be sure I remember it perfectly. 

I think Mayu and Kaji did not get together but maybe left the door open for the possibility down the line. I was rooting for Mizuki and Ken to become a couple! No idea about the bustier thing."
Atelier,Oh yea their chemistry was really good but then you find out she is a mom but never showed a husband so kind of makes you wonder. Thanks for responding btw! I have no one else to talk about it with lol
Atelier,"Haha I know the feeling! I’m glad we could chat a little about it too :) 

As for those two, yeah my ship has sailed xD it is my headcanon that they’re like a month away from the first date, child notwithstanding (it could make for a very interesting backstory, too)."
Samurai 7,"Post more threads like this for sure. Always fun to read about some of the lesser known and hyped shows that are due in 2023. I was aware of some of these shows but I had no idea stuff like Mrs Davis and The Consultant were in the works. 

You do a decent job of selling all the shows on that list and that is often more than can be said for the distributors themselves!"
Samurai 7,"This is really cool, I've seen some of these where the ""why you should be excited"" section didn't do much but you made me genuinely excited to watch a lot of these, thank you!"
Samurai 7,The Curse is going to be fucking bonkers but it's going to be on Showtime so I won't ever see it
Samurai 7,Warrior season 3 HBO Max
Samurai 7,"There's a non-zero chance that Brit Marling's show is actually season 3 of The OA in disguise, knowing how creative she is."
Samurai 7,"Fantastic write up, love the format. Already knew about many of these, but the 'Why should I be excited?' would for sure sell me on these shows otherwise. Specially the mention of showrunners, writers, and directors and previous shows, since is really common for people to look for new shows based on previous ones they've liked.

I personally I'm most excited for **The Fall of the House of Usher**, as a Flanagan superfan that recently watched **Midnight Mass** and loved every second of it and **Retreat**, ever since **The OA** cancellation my heart longs for more Brit and Zal storytelling.

I'll add **The Consultant**, **Mrs. Davis** and **The Curse** to my list, all seem like great projects."
Samurai 7,Interesting that there's no mention on IMDB or the show's poster that Shogun is an adaptation of an incredibly popular book by James Clavell. You would think they'd want to let people know to draw in that audience
Samurai 7,Woah the guy who made counterpart is making a shogun adaption?? Holy fuck I am extremely excited for that. Counterpart is one of the coolest shows I’ve ever seen and definitely the most unique spy thriller show.
Samurai 7,Well now im interested in Time bandits
Samurai 7,Nice to see a list that isn't just posting all the blockbuster shows
Samurai 7,The ending to the time bandits movie was so messed up it still bothers me to this day ever time I think about it.
Samurai 7,Most interesting is mrs davis
Samurai 7,Really looking forward to the Apple + shows.  Mrs American Pie and Time Bandits.
Samurai 7,"I started watching Willow and was thinking how cool it would be to have a Time Bandits TV series, so happy to see it on the list. The rest of the shows don't really interest me much at this stage, going by the descriptions. Could be some gems in there but nothing I can see right now.

Thanks for posting though."
Samurai 7,"Not excited by any of those, but thanks for the post.

Hopefully something piques my interest in the next one.

I have almost nothing to watch at the moment and struggling to find new stuff."
Samurai 7,"Or I can not access the streaming service or I dont have that service or Is not interesting enough. Or all reasons to once in the mayority of times.

But your work is interesting."
Samurai 7,Looking forward to Shogun. Anything with Samurai Warriors & Japanese Culture intrigue me.
Samurai 7,"Echo (Disney+) 

Agatha: Coven of Chaos (Disney+)"
Samurai 7,"> Shōgun, set in feudal Japan, charts the collision of two ambitious men from different worlds and a mysterious female samurai.

That... Is not the plot of ""Shogun"""
Samurai 7,None of these sound interesting.
Samurai 7,How about some foreign shows?
Samurai 7,"Great, more of the same shitty shows for white, middle-aged, alcoholic moms."
Samurai 7,Only the curse sounds great on paper
Samurai 7,"They pretty much all sound good, but really excited for retreat, shogun and the curse because of whose attached"
Samurai 7,I try to keep on top of new stuff but there's a couple of things I'd not heard of that I'll likely read more about/check out
Samurai 7,Only one I knew about was House of Usher. I'll definitely check out the shows from ''Servant'' and ''The OA''s creators as well as the one from Lindelof.
Samurai 7,Honestly I had never heard about any of these shows before reading this. Definitely looking forward to a few of them.
Samurai 7,"If Damon Lindelof hadn't already sold me on Mrs Davis, ""Betty Gilpin as a nun battling artificial intelligence"" definitely did"
Samurai 7,Agreed. Excellent thread and now I have shows to be excited for. I’m pumped.
Samurai 7,"To be fair, most of those shows just haven't started their marketing campaign. The important thing for the distributors is that people know about it when it releases."
Samurai 7,"Same. As someone who loves House Hunters International *and* Emma Stone, I feel like this show was basically made for me but I have no clue if Showtime is even a thing here? And if not, where can I watch it?"
Samurai 7,It's really not that hard to watch a show on a channel you don't have c'mon.
Samurai 7,Paramount+ and Amazon Prime have deals on Showtime frequently. If you have Prime go sign up for their 1.99 a month Black Friday deal and watch Yellowjackets. At least if you're in the USA.
Samurai 7,"Please God, I'd do anything for this"
Samurai 7,we can only hope.
Samurai 7,It was evil.
Samurai 7,Shogun doesn't interest you?
Samurai 7,What do you like?
Samurai 7,Read the book. It is a masterpiece.
Samurai 7,I'm pretty sure at least 2 of the 10 are foreign.
Samurai 7,"There was one on the list, but I’d love to see more options too. There are some great shows out there we  Americans miss out on until someone like AMC+ or EPIC+ buys the rights. *This is Going To Hurt* was my favorite show this year and no one saw it."
Samurai 7,You need to get out and experience the world more.
Samurai 7,"Indeed. I read through the list and perhaps *Time Bandits* might work, assuming Jemaine can successfully reign in Taika still.

Also I don’t like the Horror genre but Mike Flanagan can probably pull off a big win."
Samurai 7,"Yeah, only one of those seemed even remotely interesting"
Samurai 7,For real…. but latter day snarky soap operas seem pretty cheap to churn out.
Samurai 7,"I’m not criticising the networks for not promoting these shows that are probably not due until well into 2023. Most will ramp up marketing a month out from the release date. 

I’m just saying the OP’s article here has done more to hype and hook me for the shows on this list than the majority of marketing I’ve seen for any show released in the last two or three months."
Samurai 7,No.
Samurai 7,"It's difficult to imagine it being better than the Richard Chamberlain mini series, but I'm still looking forward to it"
Samurai 7,"I'd like a new sci-fi show.

Finished up Star Trek DS9 recently and trying Battlestar Galactica but struggling."
Samurai 7,no what ?
Samurai 7,"The first season of battlestar is a bit of a slog, but it gets really good in season 2. The expanse is really good if you haven’t seen it."
Samurai 7,"Yeah DS9 was the same.

Looking forward to BSG getting better.

I'll add The Expanse to try next, thanks for the recommendation."
Samurai 7,Luckily haven’t seen a single one of these lol
Samurai 7,I highly disagree about Heels.. it was a well written show with good drama.
Samurai 7,A worst shows of 2021 list is incomplete without Apple TV's Invasion included.
Samurai 7,I will not stand for Heels slander.
Samurai 7,I'm not entirely convinced half of these shows aren't made up.
Samurai 7,"i had to sit thru Sex/Life. Wife loved it, for me every minute was torture."
Samurai 7,"I liked it, but Cowboy Bebop should be #1 by a wide margin. It was canceled the same day it was released (hyperbole).

Also, where are Wheel Of Time and Foundation? Again, I enjoyed both, but I spent a considerable amount of time on both subs and both series are very divisive 

Heels doesn't belong on this list. A Best of 2021 series..

I agree with Yasuke. I was expecting historical fiction that made me Google a whole bunch of terms, but instead we got some science fiction junk. Did have a great soundtrack."
Samurai 7,"Never heard of Them but it's got a great iMDB score. I don't know if I mind a little ripping off, that's how new frontiers are explored. There wouldn't be a lot of great bands if they never ripped off Black Sabbath."
Samurai 7,"Katla is fine imo.

Invasion and Cowboy Bebop deserve to be mentioned on this list."
Samurai 7,Wheel of time for me. Expected and wanted better.
Samurai 7,"Gossip girl reboot was so painful. I would argue that *some* of the case is talented. The actor playing Julien makes me want to stab myself with her delivery. Max is like Chuck bass lite. Audrey is like only the nice parts of blair with none of the spice. There’s not as much plotting which is what made the original so much campy fun. I think they need more monet and Luna to inject some life into this thing. I feel like zoya julien and Obie and aki don’t have much charisma to speak of 

Also I literally couldn’t  believe how cringe the writing/ dialogue on sex/ life was. I’m shocked I finished either of these shows but I was couch bound for a period of time so that’s probably why"
Samurai 7,"lol Didn't even know there's a remake of I Know What You Failed at Last Scream Ripoff.

Speaking of which, that wasn't even a great movie to begin with. I don't know why anyone would bother to remake it."
Samurai 7,Definitely agree with Katla. The first episodes I was hooked because you want to find out how and why these things are happening. But the season falls apart more and more with each episode and characters doing incredibly incredibly stupid shit.
Samurai 7,Lee Pace is solely responsible for Foundation not being on this list. It should be though.
Samurai 7,The most remarkable thing about this list is that Foundation and Invasion are not on it.
Samurai 7,"Thankfully haven’t seen these. And the ones I know of, I actively avoided. The worst show I watched was Nine Perfect Strangers. Couldn’t even finish it."
Samurai 7,Have a feeling the 4400 reboot will make this list when it comes out. Only saw Katla was hyped for it due to who was involved but just your average Netflix/SVOD drama.
Samurai 7,"I know it's not a new show, just a new season, but Snowpiercer season 3 has been pretty disappointing. First three episodes were okay, then five where basically nothing happens, and now one moderately good one leading to the season finale which just looks like it's going back to the first season."
Samurai 7,"I thought Gossip Girl was entertaining as hell, and I enjoyed having the Hawaiian setting of I Know What You Did Last Summer on in the background as I was doing other things. There's way worse stuff out there. Like Invasion or The 4400 reboot."

Samurai 7,Book of boba fett started in December right?  Lol
Samurai 7,did only watch katla from the list. i wouldnt say one of the worst but that review couldnt be more agreeable. writers sucked badly about a good premise and cast did really bad job on this.
Samurai 7,"Wondering what Sex/Life would be like had it bee made in the 80s and if Patricia Rozema directed all episodes. Maybe it's the times, but shows about a woman's rock phase now has less bite than it did forty years ago. 

Also, another friend of mine tweeted about how Sarah Shahi plays a psych major but can't figure out her basic bitch of a husband which is accurate."
Samurai 7,"Yasuke instead of being what it should have been - probably something like Rurouni Kenshin, wanted to be Samurai Seven and just couldn't make it."
Samurai 7,I actually watched I Know What You Did Last Summer and even enjoyed most of it in a so bad it's funny way for the most part but the ending was just offensively stupid.
Samurai 7,I don't think I've even heard of a single one of those.
Samurai 7,This is literally the first time I've ever heard anything negative about it.
Samurai 7,"Definitely. Heels is a gem with a 8.1 score on IMDB after 6.2K votes. Ace, Wild Bill, Jack and Crystal are interesting characters with nice tension between some of them and the plot, which feels authentic, made me very invested."
Samurai 7,Nor will I sit for it
Samurai 7,"If you only use reddit as proof, then any book adaptation is going to be garbage. Outside of the diehard book fans, wheel of time did really well. It had good reviews and great viewership. Even the ratings are good when you consider the fact that diehard book fans brigaded and gave one star reviews"
Samurai 7,">I liked it, but Cowboy Bebop should be #1 by a wide margin

Not even close.  Yasuke was clearly worse."
Samurai 7,"It's not really a rip off, black horror is a popular genre now. Jordan Peele is not the only person that can make black horror films."
Samurai 7,"They could've at least not titled it ""Them"" considering there's a recent release called ""Us"". Like if you're going to rip off Black Sabbath you probably wouldn't want to call yourself Dark Saturday."
Samurai 7,i agree with invasion.
Samurai 7,Yep.  It’s one of the worst shows I’ve ever watched.  And I’ve watched a lot of cheap sci fi/fantasy made in the 80s & 90s.
Samurai 7,"Agreed. My expectations were tempered as I knew cuts would have to be made.  But they introduced entirely new scenes, rewrote character personality and motivations, and switched several important achievements/events to female characters.

It was an expensive, poorly constructed vehicle to promote The Message."
Samurai 7,"Second this, because from all those in the list above, I expected shit, and we got shit.

Wheel of time with its budget and potential was probably the biggest let down."
Samurai 7,"The 4400 reboot has been out actually, it premiered last year in October, I believe.

I saw maybe one and a half episodes and uhh... Well, personally, I just hated the dialogue, can't comment on much else as I didn't get very far :D"
Samurai 7,"Giving ""worst performance"" to a 6 year old is certainly an opinion lmao"
Samurai 7,"It’s almost a bit disrespectful regardless of how good the film is to force that semantic “Us and Them” connection, normally reserved for spiritual sequels, to a film they have no relation to, purely for marketing reasons.

It reminds me of a book I read where a superhero called Battery (because she charges energy) is forced to take on a partner who calls themselves Assault, purely to completely change the meaning of Battery’s identity through the automatic “Assault & Battery” association."
Samurai 7,"For a second I thought I was on the Witcher sub cause everything u described happened with the Witcher lol.

>	switched several important achievements/events to female characters.

The only difference being that the achievements were mostly given to one character, Yennefer. So much achievements and character arcs were given to her that folks speculate there is some [self insert](https://reddit.com/r/witcher/comments/rwhzzh/the_show_is_in_love_with_yennefer_and_it_will/) going on with the showrunner. It probably also doesn’t help she said Yennefer is her favorite. The cherry on top is that I wish the only change they made was giving her so many achievements and character arcs, they also decided to just completely change her character from the books.

Season 2 is 90% made up with the first episode being the only one that is somewhat based on the short story from the first book. The rest is I kid you not all made up. Even the “deathless mother”, which is a huge character in S2, doesn’t even exist in the book. To add insult to injury it was the showrunner’s second time promising the season this time would be a close adaptation with little to no original content. With s3 coming she is once again promising the same thing on her twitter lol.

Edit: linked one thread talking about it"
Samurai 7,"Honestly, I couldn't look past them cutting out the boat training montage. It was my fav part of book one lol."
Samurai 7,[deleted]
Samurai 7,What’s wrong with honesty? Not like he said it to the girl just gave his opinion.
Samurai 7,"lol i don't know if you've seen this series, but if you did, i don't know *how* you could and this kid's performance not standout to you because of how atrocious everything was everytime he appeared on screen. 

there were even a few memes of the kid on twitter. lol. everytime he had to deliver a line the entire flow of the show just crumbled. worst child actor I've ever seen."
Samurai 7,"I did read Cavill has supposedly negotiation for more story control, and he said he intends to keep it closer to the book.  We'll see.

Unfortunately, WOT has no actor or celebrity with enough clout to do the same."
Samurai 7,The showrunner shoved in filler for over 25% of the season.  And the filler did nothing to drive the plot or make the adaptation better for tv/visual medium etc.
Samurai 7,"Space ghost coast to coast was a god send

Edit: Ooh, mama, am I nervous. Sweatin' like a Trekkie. I smell like oil of Olestra. "
Personal Taste,I disagree but I love a good unpopular opinion. Here's your upvote.
Personal Taste,"Completely agree. It's a show about family trauma dressed up as something fancy and that's about it. It's not funny or witty, everyone is shitty, the dialogue is like a madlibs of phrases and nothing ever happens."
Personal Taste,"First off all it's an HBO show so people over at Warner Media have control over its promotion/awards push/street cred.

I do enjoy the show, but yes, it's overrated.
I've seen people mention Succession in The GOAT discussion and people's top 5 already.

I'm guessing these people haven't seen the modern masterpieces such as Better Call Saul, Fargo, Mr Robot, Gomorrah which are all elite tier."
Personal Taste,"Literally just googled ""succession- overrated?"" because I just started watching yesterday and after a few episodes into the first season I'm really not feeling it and I was just so disappointed. After all the praise it's gotten I expected, at the very least, the dialogue to be written well but it's... kind of terrible? Say what you will about Aaron Sorkin's tendency towards melodrama and (for those that don't like it) music cadence in his writing- but damn, at least he's clever. And as far as the rich, horrible, back-stabbing family members/business partners aspect of the show goes- it's been done before and far better. 

This is not to say people shouldn't be able to enjoy it. Enjoy away, by all means. It just wasn't the great revelation I was expecting and I wanted to check and see if maybe it merely started off rocky and got better. But... based on this post, it looks like it will just be a lot more of the same. So I think I'll cut my loses & go find something else to watch. Thanks for the insight."
Personal Taste,"Mostly agree...it's entertaining to a point, but I have been far more engaged by other shows in the past. It doesn't stay on my mind or plant interesting things to ponder until the next episode; I don't find myself with that longing for the next episode the way I have with some shows. Primarily, I just watch the awful people being awful, have some emotional gut-reactions to their mustache-twirling machinations or ""shocking"" impropriety, chuckle here and there at the ""rich people problems,"" and then forget about it all shortly after watching. Most people I know on Facebook seem to currently be in a contest, falling all over themselves to be the one heaping the most praise on it, but I just don't see it. And with many of them it's hard to put a finger on, since we usually have pretty similar tastes. It's...a fine show? I'll keep watching for now, but it's certainly not something I'd ever even consider watching a second time."
Personal Taste,The excessive cursing is the most tryhard thing I've ever seen in a TV show. They try SO hard to be cool and it doesn't come across as genuine at all. Nobody talks like that 100% of the time no matter how rich or conniving they are. Honestly felt embarrassed for the actors while watching it and gave up after episode 5.
Personal Taste,I don’t think it’s overrated at all but that doesn’t mean it appeals to everyone which buzzy stuff has a tendency to imply.
Personal Taste,You are entitled to your opinion but I completely disagree.
Personal Taste,">	It might be some people's personal taste, but I kinda wished people spoke normally in this show.

Well, people do. Hadn't you noticed? The people who *aren't part of the family*, aren't part of the company, speak in naturalistic dialogue.

It's a use of language to mark who's in and who's out. The more ""in"" you are, or the more ""in"" you're trying to be, the more your language is inflected by these ""shorthand-corporate-training-handbook"" idioms. *Logan Roy's* language. It's people trying to be near him, be like him, be him.

People who Logan Roy doesn't have power over, or people who don't give a shit about Waystar RoyCo, have naturalistic dialogue. People hopelessly corrupted by being in his orbit say stuff like ""I'd like my Twitter to be 'off the hook'"", or ""fire a million poisonous spiders down your *dickey*"", because they're trying to follow Logan Roy's mold in the exercise of linguistic power over people through manipulation and threat."
Personal Taste,"I 100% agree with every point you made. When I watch a show, I like to forget the actors are acting. But the dialogue is too scripted that it just doesn't feel immersive or real."
Personal Taste,I love the show but totally agree with you about the dialogue.  The metaphors get old.  I feel like Kendall forgot how to speak like an adult so far this season.  Everything he says is like the example you wrote about.  I still like the show and will continue to watch.
Personal Taste,There’s no such thing as overrated. You may not like it as much as others but the general reception is what it is
Personal Taste,"I absolutely love this show. The writing is immaculate and carried out perfectly by the cast. I love the depth of every character. I just love this show. That being said, I wish the story moved on from “who’s going to take over”. I think this is the last season so that’s is probably it. But I’m a fan to the end and this is on my top 3 favorite shows."
Personal Taste,Couldn’t agree more. I watch it and forget about it. It’s fine but I can’t believe how people say it’s the best show they’ve ever seen.
Personal Taste,"I only watched through season 2.

The show is not well shot. There's no creative use of the handcam gimmick, even for layups like humor. The dialogue is not that interesting and certainly not that funny. The show absolutely butchers and misuses its supporting characters (Marcia Roy, Lawrence Yee and Brian/Zach Cherry were all super promising and provided opportunities the show desperately needed to flesh out the story but the scriptwriters either forget about them or toss them out the window). The music is TERRIBLE and almost obscenely low-effort (I have never been so thick of a theme/motif in my life).

The sets are great and the acting is great but Better Call Saul makes Succession look like a high school film.

Still a hundred times better than ersatz shit like Fargo, Dave, or Watchmen, though."
Personal Taste,"Season 1 really made my hopes high and I looked forward to it but eventually seeing it all, I think it is highly overrated. All it does is gives you a sneak peak of how 1% of the population lives or maybe a very small part of that 1%. The plot is repittive, there was some good stuff in season 2 but 3 was meh."
Personal Taste,You call the show immature but are mad major things don’t happen every episode lol.   This show is clearly too mature for you if this is all you got out of it
Personal Taste,"I love the show but agreed on the dialogue. The way people talk remind me of Sorkin. Not in the specific style but how no one in real life talks like almost any of the characters on the show. 

Sometimes it gets really frustrating. Just say what you mean instead of incredibly specific metaphors that are clearly written."
Personal Taste,"Maybe check out this article: [https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2021/nov/16/its-like-a-horror-film-why-succession-season-three-will-end-in-tragedy](https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2021/nov/16/its-like-a-horror-film-why-succession-season-three-will-end-in-tragedy). I think it echoes some of your points about the lack of  movement in the overall story. 

Personally, I haven't really noticed this and I've just been watching for the spectacle of seeing how this whole thing plays out. I really like season 3 actually and think this is the best season so far whereas seasons 1 and 2 were mostly setting the stage. Hopefully come the end of the season you will change your mind about the show."
Personal Taste,"I only watch to be part of the zeitgeist.  I'd classify it as ""hate-watching"" but I also understand that similar to music, everyone has their own tastes"
Personal Taste,"It’s not a smash hit like GoT.

People are fascinated, repulsed and jealous simultaneously of the life of the super rich. That’s the appeal of the show IMO.

But this show has a limited shelf life. Needs to have an end date before things start getting stale.

I have a feeling the show is going to end with Logan Roy dying or becoming a vegetable."
Personal Taste,"You take that back, sir."
Personal Taste,[deleted]
Personal Taste,"Shows get overrated because there are so many boring ass, by the numbers, formulaic shows that anything that departs from that fires people up."
Personal Taste,You ever see a good show that wasn't overrated. Even the crap is overrated.
Personal Taste,">It might be some people's personal taste, but I kinda wished people spoke normally in this show. Not everything has to be some weird metaphor to dick sucking or ass munching. I know this is a comedy-drama, but it just feels like a very immature drama. 

Hmm. Roman's character is just immature. He has a lot of sexual hang-ups, and I would say it's mostly him that rushes into making those kinds of metaphors.

More generally, I like that they all have their unique voices. I liked Kendall going around calling himself the ""Puppet Master"" in the last episode. Greg is still an awkward schmuck interpersonally but it also trying to make moves now. 

I have the same general critique of the show that you do, that this specific season seems a little less driven or focused than the last season was. But the interpersonal stuff remains good, to me. I think the show would lose part of it's strength if it took their voices away from them."
Personal Taste,Season 1 and 2 were great. Couldn’t turn away. 3’s really dropped the ball. Feels one dimensional without those juicy sub plots of 1 and 2. With most of those ends tied up you’re left with a run of the mill charge for the throne.
Personal Taste,"Just finished season 1. It is no Six Feet Under, but I'm interested in following these assholes around for another 2 seasons."
Personal Taste,"Had to google Succession overrated after seeing Rolling Stones ranked it as the 11th greatest show of all time

Enjoyed the show as well however found it to be just be a bit one dimensional where there's just low levels of variability in how the episodes play out. I'll give it the point that it likely does have wide appeal but it being ranked 11th by Rolling Stones has it highly overrated imo. 

Would personally give it about an 8.5/10."
Personal Taste,"My family was raving about Succession, so I added HBOMax to check it out. I have binged the episodes, and am in the middle of Season 3. I currently have no desire to watch anymore. The acting and the dialogue is really well done, but the show goes absolutely nowhere. Roman's juicy and snarky dialogue is getting old, and as much as I like Jeremy Strong, his character is a completely unlikeable, mopey, bipolar and flakey drug addict. Three seasons of a dysfunctional family fighting off a hostile takeover is just getting old - and that is the entirety of the show: 25 episodes so far of the Roy family trying to convince shareholders from accepting a higher buyout price from a slightly mysterious character, while they all stab each other in the back and cover-up an awful malfeasance in their cruise division from the 1990s. Highly overrated show, but then again nearly everything on television is usually crap."
Personal Taste,Thank you kind stranger
Personal Taste,"lol, same. Watched only one episode and was kinda meh. Was hoping hear about a build up etc. Much of it seemed like a lifestyles of the rich and famous sorta thing with backstabbing. Not my cup of tea tbf."
Personal Taste,"5 episodes in, can't agree more.  You are correct about the writing in particular.  It feels like it was autogenerated by an app. I suppose it's unfair to expect West Wing, The Wire or The Americans level writing and show running but I do.  And shows like that are in another galaxy in terms of quality.  Succession, at its best, doesn't even reach escape velocity from a world of  mediocrity."
Personal Taste,">And as far as the rich, horrible, back-stabbing family members/business partners aspect of the show goes- it's been done before and far better.

Do you have any examples? I love Succession because of these aspects and I can't think of any other great shows or movies off the top of my head that are centered around them. Not calling you out, just genuinely cant think of any."
Personal Taste,This is exactly how I feel. Thanks. 🤪
Personal Taste,Tips for better shows?
Personal Taste,"Exactly this!

After a certain point of ""praise"" a lot of works start to fall into an area where it is perceived that it will just be ""universally liked"" which isn't always exactly what the praise is saying or necessarily represents. And thus more and more of ""overrated"" and such post come through.

There was a video a LONG while back on someone putting why he hates giving games a score rating because ""There are games that I play on technically I can't find anything wrong with it, and I know others will easily have fun with but just isn't clicking for me. And then there are times where I am playing a game I explicitly know is flawed but is just syncing with me but I know if I recommend it people would think I am crazy"". And I think that relates with a lot of people, them wanting to admit it or not."
Personal Taste,The point of the character is to show the regression and self destruction he causes himself. That is what is being portrayed in S3
Personal Taste,"Says the person that was claiming Arcane's popularity was inflated by astroturfing just a day ago. 

Guess a show is only overrated and inflated when you dont personally like it. Got it."
Personal Taste,Thank you. I really hate that word.
Personal Taste,"I get that. The same goes for superhero movies and anime. I don’t exactly love it, I may not even like it, but the general public does so I don’t mind it existing. It’s just not for me"
Personal Taste,"I'm going to disagree with you there.  I truly believe that some shows get popular because people fall in love with the coolness of the show itself (not the premise, but the fact that you feel ""in"" for watching it).  People see the ratings and think they should like it too.  I've seen several people saying that season 3 is dragging and has the same premise as season 1.  I'm literally two episodes into season 1, and the same premise has played out 5 times already.  That tells me that there is a disconnect between how people think of the show and what is actually happening.  I believe people became so enamored with it early on that they fail to see the shortcomings that more people are beginning pointing out."
Personal Taste,“You must have a high IQ to watch Rick and Morty”
Personal Taste,">I have a feeling the show is going to end with Logan Roy dying or becoming a vegetable.

The show is called Succession, and is all about who will take over when Logan dies. The series literally begins with him having a major health scare. It is definitely a safe bet that he will die before the series ends lol"
Personal Taste,"I agree with you. The primary appeal is voyeuristic.  


My problem with the show is the (absolutely stale) premise of each and every episode-- ""Who's going to be CEO?"" Yeah, there's sibling rivalry for the top spot: We get it. Move on..."
Personal Taste,Ah yes a show about LOL and a CN show. You def know me
Personal Taste,"Deadwood, The Sopranos, Rome and The Wire. That's about it."

Personal Taste,"Counter argument: All first season shows should be a self contained story. If it is decent enough, then a second season could be considered. 

Many of not most Netflix shows don't have story to cover 8 episodes, let alone 10-13, and the seasons drag on aimlessly."
Personal Taste,"You've got a little nugget of a coherent point in there, hidden amongst the needlessly inflammatory language and mostly wrong assertions about personal taste"

Honestly the fact that you think it's one or the other makes me not care too much about what you think. If you genuinely think your opinions are immutable facts then there's not much to be had in any discussion."
Personal Taste,What sacred vow did Netflix take where they have a “higher obligation” to do anything with their shows?
Personal Taste,I needed the laugh that this title gave me.
Personal Taste,"> Let me preface this by I do not care at all about Netflix's profitability. I care none whatsoever about Netlix's arbitrary metrics for renewing a show.

This take is already worthless. The reason that Netflix cancels shows before they are 'finished' is precisely because of profitability and internal metrics.

> I also do not believe in subjectivity when it comes to television or movies. It's fact The Wire is a good show. If you disagree, you are defying all rationality.

This is clearly wrong. Even the Wire has some negative reviews. I have never even watched the show because it doesn't appeal to me.

> With that said, it's also fact Netlfix has cancelled many good shows which has done a great disservice to its viewers and more importantly itself. If Netflix is supposed to be akin to a library of movies and shows it's like they tore out the last chapters of many of its books.

Netflix is not a public service, they are a private company. They can remove items from the catalog at any point, which is something that their paying customers agree to. Is it disheartening for some shows to be cancelled? Sure. But every show comes to an end eventually, it just *appears* that Netflix cancels them at a greater rate because of the vast number of shows they have in production.

> Just because an asset they have isn't profitable in the short term doesn't mean it won't ever be profitable to them.

This suggests that they should keep shows that objectively have poor viewership ratings in the extremely unlikely scenario that the shows will achieve cult-classic status in the coming years. This would have them hemorrhaging money and, as a result, many more shows would be lost by not signing distribution contracts.

> Ultimately I am tired of having my heart broke by Netflix, not much else for me to say.

Your heart isn't being broken by Netflix, it is being broken by the shows that are being axed. If you appreciate a show that died, ask yourself why they did not write a conclusive ending to the last season you watched. Writers bank on cliffhangers and incomplete storylines to garner another season, and it instead hurts the viewers. That isn't the fault of Netflix."
Personal Taste,"I think Netflix is launching too many shows and their recommendation algorithm is not what it used to be, so it cannot keep up.

When I try to watch Netflix, most of their recommendations are for things I have already seen and things I have already decided that I won't watch. It keeps recommending all of those CW DC shows that I gave up on years ago (basically, Arrow season 4 happened, although it is a little bit more complex than that - I realized that those shows will always lead with some decent action to pull you in and then turn into teen soaps because it is cheaper, and I'm not interested in teen soaps ever). There are so few new shows hidden in among them, that the algorithm is pointless for me - I find interesting shows outside Netflix and then have to search for them. Just something simple like ""don't recommend this to me again"" without disliking it would go a long way.

Now, I also get why Netflix throws everything at the wall to try to make something stick - they want to keep us all from trying alternatives by keeping us stuck in their ecosystem - but I think that it is failing them."
Personal Taste,[deleted]
Personal Taste,Then watch the fucking shows!
Personal Taste,"Cancel Netflix, tell them why on your survey, and move on.  There's plenty of other streaming services for your money."
Personal Taste,Why is Netflix getting this scrutiny? The TV networks have been cancelling shows for decades. I don't see anyone complaining about them.
Personal Taste,"Or! People could try and write their seasons so they have an ending and not rely on dragging their storylines over multiple seasons. Most television series could be cut in half and still get their plots across as most of stuff in them is filler. The multiple episode format was created for advertisers and the networks, not the filmmakers."
Personal Taste,"I feel like the part that's being missed on Netflix's part is that by not completing most of the shows they make, they risk people not giving future properties a chance out of a fear of investment with no payoff."
Personal Taste, Bring back Travelers.
Personal Taste,[removed]
Personal Taste,This has to be a fucking joke
Personal Taste,"Why does stupid stuff like this keep getting posted and upvoted? You think a business cares if a few people like a show? If it's not doing well it gets canceled, what's so fucking hard to understand about that?"
Personal Taste,[deleted]
Personal Taste,"While we love talking about Netflix Originals, cancelling a show before it's finished is far from one of them.

At a certain point a show isn't just unprofitable, but just throwing money in the garbage production wise despite its popularity. When a show becomes more popular the actors starting wanting more money, and when someone gets paid usually other actors have it in their contracts to get more money and it snowballs.

Sure it sucks when a show you love never gets an end and it bugs me just as much, but let's not pretend this is some Netflix only occurrence let alone a new one. Firefly is one of the biggest examples of a show being dropped before it finished and arguably at the height of its popularity and this was before anyone had even heard the name Netflix.

If you want to stop having your ""heart broken"" then stop being naïve to be blunt. Canceling shows early isn't new and it isn't some slight against you personally. Thought given that you said "" Let me preface this by I do not care at all about Netflix's profitability. I care none whatsoever about Netlix's arbitrary metrics for renewing a show."", you clear are not only incredibly naive, but also selfish and exactly the type of person Netflix isn't going to give two shits about. Chances are you aren't even paying for Netflix you are using a friend/roommate/parents account and are just groaning on the internet for Karma points."
Personal Taste,They could even just have a 2 hour wrap up TV movie type thing.
Personal Taste,Honestly the cancelling of shows doesn't bother me so much as the noncompete clause they require them to sign that prevents them from effectively ever being picked up again by other networks.  That is where I feel Netflix oversteps.
Personal Taste,Fucking GLOW!!!!!!!!
Personal Taste,Dude what show did they just cancel that has you so triggered?
Personal Taste,Networks cancel unprofitable shows all the time. Why do people get so bothered when Netflix does it?
Personal Taste,I'm still passed they canceled the next season of The Dark Crystal
Personal Taste,"> It's fact The Wire is a good show. If you disagree, you are defying all rationality.

Stopped reading here."
Personal Taste,I think the people who make decisions at Netflix don't perceive new series as art or as something that has any value beyond being bait to bring in more subscribers. They found out that they can make money from unfinished books so that's what they'll continue to provide.
Personal Taste,"At this point I would even take the cast of a show that was cancelled reading out a script for a series finale.

Don't have to spend any extra money on filming, we will know how the story of that particular show ends"
Personal Taste,"That's not a feature.  That's a business model.  And the only way that will change is if you talk with your wallet.  If you're still subscribing to Netflix, why should they change what you're happy to give them a monthly fee for?"
Personal Taste,Why post to a discussion site when you're going to spend so much time telling people you don't care about what they say and do not intend to listen?
Personal Taste,Also bring back star ratings and not the dumb thumb so we actually see a the bad stuff
Personal Taste,The wire is too slow at the beginning
Personal Taste,Nobody ever watched Twin Peaks after it aired because it didn't have an ending.
Personal Taste,"OA was always gonna be a hard sell to a wider audience. I wish Netflix had prestige devisions like smaller networks on tv or smaller film distributors who the mothership leaves alone to do their own thing. What I don't get is how they knocked off The Dark Crystal when it was the most hype thing through its premiere for many weeks, had its own strategy video game, and clearly was a big investment. Often it seems like Netflix, if it had the rights to Lord of the Rings instead of Amazon, would make Fellowship of the Ring, consider Two Towers, but ultimately junk it and go on to something else. This makes me very concerned for the properties they've acquired like Narnia. Sure, they actually finished A Series of Unfortunate Events, but I feel like it was begrudgingly by the third season."
Personal Taste,">How can I recommend a show to a friend or family member if I have to preface by saying the show will never be complete? Why would I go to a particular library if I could never finish a book?

The fundamental flaw in your argument becomes clear in this analogy. Television shows and books are not the same thing, which is why the analogy does not work.

Television shows are not meant to tell a single story. The business model isn't actually well-suited for this. For the vast majority of people, a show is a thing you watch until you don't, for whatever reason. You lost interest. You have other things to do. You just can't go through the trouble. You've changed over the 5 years the show's been airing and it no longer matters to you. And studios have the same attitude. They produce the shows until they don't.

People who refuse to watch a show because ""they don't know if it will be complete"" are a small minority. The vast majority of people don't think like this at all, because this is simply not the way television has worked for most of its existence. It hasn't even that long since you can even *choose to watch a television show after it aired*.

I read these posts and I honestly wonder if the person posting is like 12 years old. Not because the argument is immature, but because it's so ahistorical. Television shows having an ending wasn't all that common until recently. Television shows ending on a *high* is still a rarity. The track record of successful, fully serialized shows is practically nonexistent. Where on earth are you people developing these expectations?"
Personal Taste,Lmao the entitlement on this post is super extreme.
Personal Taste,"Netflix's only obligation is to maximize profits for it's shareholders.  If it can show a video of a black dot and have people subscribe to watch it, then it's doing it's job.

Most serial shows nowadays usually prepare the season finale with closing elements.  It acts as a somewhat satisfactory end should the show not get renewed.  If the showrunners don't bother to do this, it's their fault.  Not Netflix/any network.  Renewal should not be a guaranteed given."
Personal Taste,"I dont know, I'm all for shows having shorter runs... so many of them seem to just drag on - too many episodes per season and top many seasons.  I feel like Daredevil wrapped its story up perfectly in 3 seasons.  Shows like The Bodyguard and Godless I found told a pretty complete and consise story in one tight season.  I feel its more so the showrunners responsiblity to make sure each season is it's own compartmentalized story"
Personal Taste,Someone should start a streaming service that just continues Netflix’s cancelled shows
Personal Taste,"Netflix is the Google of TV shows... tons of cool shit I'm nervous about investing in, because it's probably going away in a year or two."
Personal Taste,"It's going to bite them in the ass eventually.  I no longer put ANY stake in something being a Netflix Original show.  Shows that I'm actually interested in from Netflix I just put off and will eventually watch it once it's complete (if it makes it that far).  I don't doubt they've lost a lot of equity with subscribers over the years due to this.

Canceling Daredevil after a critically acclaimed Season 3 just to spite Disney/Marvel started it off for me."

Anohana: The Flower We Saw That Day,"I had a theory since I first heard about the Jon Snow spin-off that it should take place in Essos, that way you can get around having to have the original actors back, get new storyline opportunities, etc. 

But at the same time, there probably would have to be a confrontation between Jon and Grey Worm, the person who's trying to continue Dany's anti-slave crusade."
Anohana: The Flower We Saw That Day,"The whole idea of this spin-off is  sort of weird to me. Sort of... Pointless? In my head Jon fucking off with the Wildlings is the closest he'd ever get to a happy ending. People who treat him the same whether he is a bastard or a prince. 

If they're going through with it, I hope for as few legacy characters showing up as possible. Just Jon and Tormund dealing with their trauma and... I dunno. Wildling shit. Maybe parts of the Wildlings fracture back into their own clans. Maybe some seek to become a new King Beyond The Wall and there's drama. I wouldn't be opposed to Val showing up."
Anohana: The Flower We Saw That Day,"I had a theory that Drogon would bring Daenerys’ body back to Meereen where Daario and the Second Sons are keeping the peace, and after desperately spending days trying to find someone who could save her, he encounters that red priestess from season 6 who then brings Dany back to life. 

Of course that would mean that the Lord of Light would need her alive for a reason. That reason… well that’s as far as I’ve gotten."

Anohana: The Flower We Saw That Day,"> It’s been a couple of months since the spinoff was announced by HBO, and now Anderson is weighing in on the prospect of appearing in the Harrington-led series. Anderson’s Grey Worm is one of the few who survived the aftermath of the incineration of King’s Landing, and as such, he could appear in the series. However, while speaking to E! News on the prospect of a return, Anderson remarks that he’d be shocked should such transpire. Given the way the relationship ended between the two characters, Anderson believes Grey Worm would only return to kill the White Wolf.

> ""I think it would be pretty tense if he did [appear in the new spinoff with Jon Snow]. I think the only way Grey Worm would show up in that show is to kill Jon Snow. I don’t think Grey Worm would want to see him again. I think that was quite a significant condition of [Jon] living, was like, 'I don't ever want to see your face again. I'm going to go my way, and you’re going to go your way, and that's that.' I'd be very surprised if we saw Grey Worm again."""

Something no one asked for which makes no sense and is completely unbound from the plot or prospective plot of the books. 

Jon's ruined story is finished. If they want more GOT content they should look to a Dunk and Egg series or pad out the lesser seen aspects of the world in alternative media (e.g games, comics, short stories) before they go irrevocably smearing shit on the wall of the franchise."

Anohana: The Flower We Saw That Day,"I also think it's crazy from the table read of the finale, other than every major actor being visibly distraught and upset at how the story was planned to end, the show was originally supposed to end like immediately after Jon kills Dany. No story about who becomes King, or how everyone goes their own ways, or how Jon is able to escape. It was supposed to just cut to black after the surprise death. 

Very interested to see how they spin off that ending. If Daario/Grey Worm put their differences aside to go after Jon Snow, that could make for some absolutely insane battle sequences and tension."

Let Jon Snow finally become the Prince that was promised.

But maybe that's a bit too fantasy for GoT."
Anohana: The Flower We Saw That Day,"I mean it doesn't make sense that Jon goes into exile because of Grey worm anyways especially that Grey worm is leaving for naath. Like when he sails away they can be like okay man, come on back."
Anohana: The Flower We Saw That Day,Bringing back old characters is usually good for ratings I expect we see all who survived.
Anohana: The Flower We Saw That Day,"I think it’s weird because even though Game of Thrones was a massive ensemble series, it can be (IMO) argued that Jon is the main character of the series if you had to choose one character. He even gets the final scene of the show.

So it’s a bit weird that there’s a sequel spin-off starring the main character."
Anohana: The Flower We Saw That Day,"I think they're going to try and retcon the white walker story line and have it continue beyond the wall so the Price who was Promised prophecy isn't meaningless. 

They've really been bigging it up in HOTD, which is weird to do to something that actually alienated a lot of the fanbase, unless you're going to do something with it"
Anohana: The Flower We Saw That Day,"Oh it's pretty straight forward, Game of Thrones is getting a Franchise Expansion TM that everything else is getting. Jon is a popular character so naturally they landed on giving him his own show before ever coming up with a premise (note that every other Game of Thrones spin-off cancelled or still in development actually had some premise while this one is just the Jon Snow show).

I may sound cynical but I do trust HBO to make this show worth it.

Edit: wasn't aware that Kit Harrington actually pitched the show."
Anohana: The Flower We Saw That Day,"_Wildling Shit_, the new sitcom on HBO that follows the silly hi-jinx of Jon Snow and Tormund."
Anohana: The Flower We Saw That Day,"My theory is there are gonna do a like "" ohhh the nights king wasn't actually the king but was a general and the walkers are back"" and then go and do the walkers proper justice! You can kinda see that in HOTD they are alluding too them and I think they want to fix what is probably the biggest disappointment in the entire show! Just a theory though"
Anohana: The Flower We Saw That Day,Jon's character is interesting because he's Aegon. If he's not gonna pursue that lineage and what comes with it then there's no show. A spin off of what.
Anohana: The Flower We Saw That Day,Your version sounds absolutely awful
Anohana: The Flower We Saw That Day,I actually liked the ending of the show and I also don't think a Jon Snow spinoff makes any sense. Everyone he ever loved is dead or is not going to be with him north of the wall. What's even up there for him to do for a whole series? A spinoff focusing on Arya would've made the most sense.
Anohana: The Flower We Saw That Day,I think him trying to organize north of the wall would make an interesting story.
Anohana: The Flower We Saw That Day,">The whole idea of this spin-off is sort of weird to me. Sort of... Pointless? In my head Jon fucking off with the Wildlings is the closest he'd ever get to a happy ending.

I agree. When i heard the talks about a Jon Snow sequel were getting serious i failed to think of a single direction it could go in... and I have a robust imagination. Unless they've somehow come up with a compelling storyline nobody has thought of, it feels very forced and not worth the risk of further tarnishing the legacy of the original series."
Anohana: The Flower We Saw That Day,"It's a very natural step if you want to launch any kinds of Westeros based sequels.  If things down south go to hell in a handbasket - you know because they have a sociopath king, a hand with a penchant for diabolically dumb decisions, a sellsword as treasurer, and a completely untrained maester - they could come calling on Jon at some point.  even if he ""doen whan i""."
Anohana: The Flower We Saw That Day,"> The whole idea of this spin-off is sort of weird to me. Sort of... Pointless?

Kit himself brought the idea up to George and HBO. And, according to Emilia, the show is essentially the brainchild of Kit and it's more or less being run by him.

Who knows how much of that will end up being true, and I'm not $urpri$ed he wants to return to the universe that made him a global superstar, but I have hope that him having at least some control of the show will create a series that lives up to the idea of a GOT sequel."
Anohana: The Flower We Saw That Day,"My own theory is Drogon returns to Essos, un-petrifies more dragon eggs to bring them back from extinction, and a dragon cult forms to worship them. The dragon cult raids slaver cities to offer sacrifices to the dragons, particularly Drogon."
Anohana: The Flower We Saw That Day,"Based on rumors + HOTD mentioning the Song of Ice and Fire a bunch of times, I’m thinking it’s likely that the White Walkers aren’t gone, and the Red Priestesses will bring Dany back to help fight them once again. Basically taking a second swing at that whole storyline without doing a hard remake. I feel like this show will basically be GOT continued minus the Lannisters and Kings Landing characters."
Anohana: The Flower We Saw That Day,I like to think that Drogon brings Dany to Valyria where she gets revived. In Valyria there is a small colony of Valyrians that wishes to stay hidden and teaches her about the doom of valyria which was basically a lot of Valyrian going crazy and killing everyone and everything.
Anohana: The Flower We Saw That Day,"i just kinda hope they go the route of Andor. just a high-stakes drama loosely based in the GoT world. fuck the classic narrative, let John get captured by Giants for half a season and then find a new love interest that teaches him how to snowboard like the Northern most Northerners ancestors used to do.

extra super bonus points if Danaerys, Lannisters, dragons, white walkers and thrones are never even mentioned the entire series' run."
Anohana: The Flower We Saw That Day,"> Of course that would mean that the Lord of Light would need her alive for a reason.

The sociopathic, all-knowing man-god currently ruling Westeros who broke her mind during The Bells leading to the slaughter of King's Landing so he could get power."
Anohana: The Flower We Saw That Day,"> red priestess from season 6 who then brings Dany back to life

The only issue with this is that Emilia Clarke has stated in interviews that she is done with the franchise. Now, $$$ talks and I'm sure if they threw piles of cash at her then she would come back.

But if we are to take her at her word, she won't be returning in any capacity. Besides, I think HBO wants to remove itself from bringing back too many main characters from the original show."
Anohana: The Flower We Saw That Day,He was EXCELLENT in Interview. My wife and I watched it this weekend and I told her at the end of the first episode if he didn’t at least get an Emmy nod it’d be a damn shame
Anohana: The Flower We Saw That Day,"I waited for all the episodes to come out before binging it and even though I heard only great things about it, the show still blew me away. 

Probably top 3 this year for me. What a surprise hit."
Anohana: The Flower We Saw That Day,Sooo good!!
Anohana: The Flower We Saw That Day,I just watched the first episode and had no idea that was grey worm.
Anohana: The Flower We Saw That Day,Is it Any good?
Anohana: The Flower We Saw That Day,"> one of the few who survived the aftermath of the incineration of King’s Landing,

Few? Well over half the fucking cast survived to the finale!"
Anohana: The Flower We Saw That Day,Everyone is absolutely stellar on Interview tbh.
Anohana: The Flower We Saw That Day,"I think it could work if they just gave him something to work with. Turn it into a revenge story, or about Grey Worm climbing up in Essos as part of a plan by the Iron Bank to take over Westeros or something.  There is potential here."
Anohana: The Flower We Saw That Day,"I never would have recognized him in Interview with the Vampire if it weren't for one interview where he was asked to compare his prestige tv experience on GOT vs IWTV. In fairness it's been years since game of thrones, and I think even longer since his role was of any prominence there. So cool to see him absolutely killing it in a main role."
Anohana: The Flower We Saw That Day,"IDK if the butterflies were ever mentioned in the show, but yes, he'd be just about screwed if he went there in the books."
Anohana: The Flower We Saw That Day,"No one asked for the Peacemaker TV series and yet ...

As long as they make it good, there shouldn't be an issue."
Anohana: The Flower We Saw That Day,"Tbh I think something unbound from the plot of the books would be a decent way to go, since they wouldn't have to worry about the existing canon or people who might be mad about how they adapted it

As long as Benioff and Weiss aren't involved I would probably be interested"
Anohana: The Flower We Saw That Day,"Shit I just watched the whole season and didn’t realize it was the same actor, he looks so different with hair.  He did a great job."
Anohana: The Flower We Saw That Day,his best role was getting [beaten up by daniel kaluuya](https://youtu.be/gpXA6ox4F74?t=2m04s) for leaving mean youtube comments
Anohana: The Flower We Saw That Day,"I see it more as a redo of the final season. Less a spin-off and more of a continuation of the series. That ending was massively unsatisfying, maybe we can actually get a half-decent ending here."
Anohana: The Flower We Saw That Day,"Given the success of HotD, I imagine HBO will be pretty quick to greenlight more spin-offs.  Maybe this one won't happen, but considering how eager Kit Harrington is to come back, I see no real reason it won't happen."
Anohana: The Flower We Saw That Day,"are you from outer space? HOTD and GOT are still among the most watched shows worldwide, more spinoffs are but a matter of time, especially about someone like Snow, arguably the show's MC. Heck, if anything a Jon Snow serie has more reason to exist than HOTD considering Thrones' popularity"
Anohana: The Flower We Saw That Day,Why would Torgo Nudho be buds with the guy who killed his Mhysa?
Anohana: The Flower We Saw That Day,"You're in luck because there's two shows in development that would show more of the world, there's a project set in Yi-Ti (which I believe is animated) and then one based on Corlys's voyages."
Anohana: The Flower We Saw That Day,That's another good point. Why the hell would Grey Worm go on his little adventure knowing everything Daenarys fought for in Slavers Bay is gonna go to shit?
Blood-C,"Yes but it’s not all about boobs and blood.

After Life is a perfect example. It’s a pretty bleak show. Largely about death, about suicide, about struggling with loss etc. Some censor has decided these themes are a bit on the tough side for a 15 year old. I couldn’t say if they are correct or not, but the few episodes I have seen of After Life suggest that it’s probably correct.

I do think violence should be rated more strongly - but it doesn’t always come down to the *amount* of content, but sometimes the intent of it, the emotional states driving it, or is it cartoonish or is it real? Some scenes just deliver a certain punch of shock that others don’t. But I think you will find that a lot of the rating is to do with the motivation or purpose of the violence, rather than the violence itself. It is those psychological aspects that make a more lasting impression sometimes.

That is definitely how sex is approached. It’s not about number-of-boobs per minute. Is there sexual violence? Coercion? Are women objectified? What is the emotional intent of the sex scene - is it just happy lovers, is sex being used to bargain, are people comfortable or uncomfortable. Is it vanilla or not? Is nudity with purpose or titillation? Natural or stylised? Foreground or background?

Etc etc. There are so many variables, but there are likely some pretty clear aspects of a character’s motivation or attitude that drive a higher rating. Censors would have lists of this stuff. There’s also things like drug use and language, (and language doesn’t even have to be swear words, but just particularly nasty attitudes) which can cause a higher rating even with minimal sex/violence."
Blood-C,"Seems the same as TV-MA in the US. Castlevania is TV-MA here. It has strong language and extreme violence. That's just how the ratings system is. I think TV-MA is appropriate. It doesn't mean younger people can't still watch, it's just there to tell you what you're in for and for guidance for parents of children."
Blood-C,https://www.classification.gov.au/classification-ratings/how-rating-decided
Blood-C,"sexual violence, suicide and drugs push things up

gore is generally fine"
Blood-C,"I get your point but we need an R18 so out video games dont get censored.  Also I feel too many stupid parents don't follow ratings anyway.  I'm going by how many kids I see being brought to R rated films then parents getting offended by the content Sex scene in Deadpool ringt in my memory.

What I saying if we didn't have a R rating in film and TV like we had for video games for years.  I wouldnt put it pass the Australian Nanny Government cencoring scenes and films and TV altogether."
Blood-C,"It's a loosely numerical system assigned to the amount and severity of mature themes, including language, nudity, violence, illegal substances, etc. It's not entirely arbitrary, at least in the US, but there are definitely some flaws to any system"
Blood-C,Can u feel it now mr krabs?
Blood-C,"Best revival that I’ve seen in recent years. It managed to capture the essence of the main character from the original show while also adding interesting new elements that made ‘Dexter: New Blood’ a gratifying series.

Other recent revivals like ‘The X Files’, ‘24’, ‘Twilight Zone’, ‘Heroes Reborn’ all failed to do that."
Blood-C,Easily the best Dexter villain since Trinity.
Blood-C,"He is amazing, the new season has been great."
Blood-C,He’s been an excellent villain. I’m loving this season.
Blood-C,There can be only one...
Blood-C,Is this title not a spoiler?
Blood-C,Did I just miss in the show where they said that this takes place in New York? I honestly assumed Alaska
Blood-C,"If they make 2nd season I hope he finally gets caught. I want to see trial, old characters reactions and everything."
Blood-C,Dexter moves to a small town and of course there.is a serial killer there too.
Blood-C,How the heck does a dead father age?
Blood-C,Clancy Brown has always been my choice to play the Judge if they made a movie based on Blood Meridian.
Blood-C,I always forget that's him. He's been doing a lot of cartoons I use to watch that I didn't know about
Blood-C,"Not had much competition, but agreed. Once I saw Clancy Brown was involved I knew we were in for a good time"
Blood-C,"I agree. The first couple of episodes were a bit meh, but afterwards it has been excellent. I have really enjoyed this season."
Blood-C,This’ll go over a lot of people’s heads.
Blood-C,"That the serial killer that kills serial killers faces off with a serial killer?  Nope.  Its been that way for 9 seasons, not a spoiler."
Blood-C,"The title is broad and doesn’t imply anything specific. Fate can be anything, positive or negative."
Blood-C,Nope
Blood-C,no
Blood-C,I mean it's heavily implied he found over 100 serial killers in just Miami.
Blood-C,Yea the show about serial killing has serial killers. Who'd have thought
Blood-C,In the Dexter universe there is at least one Ted Bundy in every small town.
Blood-C,Dexter's father isn't in it.
Blood-C,"Clearly, you haven't watched yet."
Blood-C,"NoRolexNoSex, I am your father."
Blood-C,This has convinced me to go back and get caught up. I watched the first couple and was pretty let down that it was just fine and was going to give up. But people seem to really like the latest episodes.
Blood-C,Or under their heads.
Blood-C,Technically you're right but it takes little to no critical thinking skills to connect the dots and have something spoiled that you may not have seen. The title is bad.
Blood-C,"No longer just implied. Last week Dexter explicitly said that he's had ""hundreds"" of people on his kill table over the years."
Blood-C,No plans for it. I watched the original series. Ill leave it at that
Blood-C,"Hey Dad, why did you choose to stop being around?"
Blood-C,"Yee I know what you mean, definitely toeing the line but technically kosher. 

I completely agree that using the word fate is a bit of a spoiler of the big twist that he’s actually Doakes trans-racial twin."
Blood-C,[deleted]
Blood-C,"Stand your mother, I could not."
Blood-C,didn’t he also one time accidentally kill an innocent person? Like season 5 or 6 or something IIRC
Blood-C,Yoda is that you?
Blood-C,[deleted]
Blood-C,"right? would be interesting if it make him question is “code” or whatever but lol nope, just went right on to killing more people"
Blood-C,Backwoods bearded Dexter hacking up mother fuckers and leaving them in the woods with no silly family ties. I'm in.
Blood-C,"They've been talking about this ever since the show ended.  Michael C. Hall left the show, he doesn't want to do it anymore.  This is a non-story until he, specifically, says otherwise."
Blood-C,"Set 25 years in the future, Dexter has one target: the murderous, conniving Harrison Morgan."
Blood-C,Just erase the last 4 seasons and start again right after season 4. There's not really anything worth keeping there.
Blood-C,Honesty the show was the best with doakes. Without him it just doesn't seem to work very well.
Blood-C,"Another misuse of the word ""reboot"" can be found in this article. The world is driving me crazy with this bullshit.

Regardless, I'd watch the hell out of some new, good Dexter. "
Blood-C,Can we just get 12 episodes of Harrison eating it on a treadmill again?
Blood-C,[deleted]
Blood-C,"I stuck around watching the show longer than I should have, but I thought the show was really going somewhere unapproached when [](/s ""Dexter's sister basically comes to terms that she loves him, and then they totally drop it all together in the next season and never bring it up again"").  It was jarring."
Blood-C,Does no one remember praying for it to finally be over with for the last 2 seasons?
Blood-C,After reading this thread I'm apparently the only one who enjoyed the entire series. Maybe it's because I viewed the finale different than most people... or I'm just crazy. 
Blood-C,"Man, I really hope this happens. At least for a one-off mini-season like 24 and X-Files are doing. (Hopefully FOX leaves it at that and doesn't try to do House again. As much as I would love to see him come back, that finale was perfect.)

Dexter was such an incredible show, and then it took a dive for mediocrity and never really resurfaced from that. Have something happen that he sees on the television that calls him out of retirement. Or maybe have someone from Miama PD hunt him down and say they found out what he did, and they'll let it stay buried if he helps them catch a serial killer on the loose. I hope Michael C. Hall gets on board with it, because it could be truly incredible if done right. "
Blood-C,"I pray that this is real. Please, please, please let it be real.

Dexter is definitely one of the best shows ever, I was *hooked* every goddamn episode. Despite the general consensus I even like the ending. Fuck the haters, this needs to be on the air again."
Blood-C,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAUY1J8KizU
Blood-C,Does this mean I'm relevant again?
Blood-C,I think I'm the only dexter fan who enjoyed every season and even the finale.
Blood-C,"Since showtime is also doing the revival of twin peaks, why not just give him a guest role?"
Blood-C,"because that last season went so swimmingly
"
Blood-C,can't be worse than the finale right?
Blood-C,Not going to lie I was a huge fan who bailed on last season hard. It just sucked in my opinion. Anyone have a link to season recap or give me the gist of last season?
Blood-C,Can't unfuck the ending of the original series.
Blood-C,I'd love for it to come back. But I also love limitless and the actress that plays Deb is a lead on that show....heck the actor that plays quin is a minor character on limitless as well.
Blood-C,"The way the last few seasons went, why is there a clammoring for more 'Dexter'?  I loved the series, but it was pretty bad towards the end.  If they have fresh and creative ideas, why weren't they implemented in the last few season?  "
Blood-C,"Please, no. I can't be the only one who thought it became irredeemable trash after season 4... Right? I know most people still like Dexter but someone else out there has to agree? Just let the show stay dead."
Blood-C,"everything between season six and the final episode was pretty shitty imo. I would however like to see where they would take it from where we left off, even if its just in a one shot or short film."
Blood-C,Can't wait for the thrilling mid-season episode where we get to see Batista doing his taxes.
Blood-C,NO. IMO Dexter ended at season 5. They've fucked it up enough already just let it die god dammit.
Blood-C,"In all seriousness, Michael C Hall hasn't done to much since Dexter, I'm sure he'd return. I'd personally love to see one more season. Though David Zayas has a recurring role on Gotham, I'm sure that can be worked around. "
Blood-C,"To clarify, there are no rumors or any news of the show returning, just that the president of Showtime would like it to return in some form based on how successful the show was. 

I definitely don't doubt that they will get a showrunner or someone on board to run a new spin-off show, but I honestly can't see Michael C. Hall returning, other than as executive producer or something like that. 

But Showtime lately has been a little odd. They announced a co-production with Microsoft to make the Halo TV series, and it has since gone ultra quiet, Twin Peaks keeps getting pushed back, and there hasn't been any major new shows outside of Billions in January and Roadies likely in the summer. Their hour-long shows look to be in a good place. Two of their longer running half-hour shows ended in the past two years, so I see that being their focus next. "
Blood-C,[deleted]

Blood-C,http://www.inquisitr.com/2592993/dexter-returns/
Blood-C,"They blew a chance at a spin off with the Zach Hamilton character that was Dexter's apprentice in the final season. He was killed off almost as an afterthought, when there were a ton of other ways for the Brain Surgeon to have announced he was back.

Following Zach would have worked as a chronicle of a killer of killers who was just starting out, since Dexter's beginnings were only covered in flashbacks. I kept hearing around the time of the final season that they were looking at a way to continue the universe without Hall, and Zach was easily the best option available."
Blood-C,Can they retcon the last four seasons?
Blood-C,"it hasnt even been gone long enough to start talking about a revival.

also, why?"
Blood-C,Hopefully they do
Blood-C,Series is great all the way up too the last 2 seasons. 
Blood-C,"unless MCH really needs  some cash or something,I can't see him going back.He has said he hated the finale"
Blood-C,please.. I've already accepted the shitty ending. Don't make it even worse (if such a thing is even possible).
Blood-C,"if it involves somehow undoing most of the last season, especially the absurd and dumb ending.. then great."
Blood-C,I could actually get behind this idea... they have a chance to fixed the botched conclusion to the series.
Blood-C,"If they don't revive the series... they'll reboot it outright. Supposedly the eight and final book in the Dexter series is forthcoming. As it were, the TV series only shares the first book's main plot; the rest of the TV show is virtually unrelated to the goings-on of the book."
Blood-C,If showtime Dosent pick it up I hope Netflix will.
Blood-C,Does he meet up with Hannibal?
Blood-C,"Pretty sure they said a while ago that it would be ""son of dexter"" dealing with his son's struggle and trying to find his dad for answers. "
Blood-C,No thanks.
Blood-C,"After the last shit season and that disastrous 'ending', I SURE HOPE **NOT!**"
Blood-C,Be sure to bring back Jennifer Carpenter.... so hot....
Blood-C,"So forgetting about seasons 5-8, does anyone feel that chronologically the show would have been better served if season 2 was the last season? Obviously rewriting parts of the script to make it fit in. So season 1 we are introduced to Dexter, we have the ice truck killer etc, then moving onto season 2 we have the whole miguel prado arc, then onto season 4 where we have the trinity killer and the crazy ending. All of this Doakes is right on his tale for the 3 seasons up until we get to season 2 in which all of dexter's kills are discovered and Lyla is introduced and shit starts to go down. "
Blood-C,Please no awkward love scenes with his estranged daughter.
Blood-C,"Yes please! I loved Dexter overall, the last few seasons were a bit weak (apart from S7 imho) but I still want more.

We need a real final season with the cops hunting Dexter (like it was supposed to go after S7 ending)"
Blood-C,Deb's dead.
Blood-C,"Was a little Meh towards the end, but even the Meh was better than some of the shows on at the moment.  Would love for a return."
Blood-C,"I'm actually okay with this.  That series needs a proper ending.  Plus

>Backwoods bearded Dexter hacking up mother fuckers and leaving them in the woods with no silly family ties

sounds like my new favorite show. "
Blood-C,"One of my top rated posts was my take on how the show should have ended. It was mostly a joke, and that should show how depressed the fandom was towards the end. 

Let the train wreck die. It had good moments."

Terrace House: Boys and Girls in the City,"This post really makes me sad, since it highlights the poor marketing Disney is giving the series. 

It's been [known](https://twitter.com/DisneyAPromos/status/1600624288855658496) for nearly a month, yet there are still people out of the loop/it wasn't established enough to get hype. This, coupled with iTunes leaking it, will hurt it when it ultimately airs."
Terrace House: Boys and Girls in the City,"Looking forward to this. Will be terribly sorry to see the show end though, it really hit a hell of a stride."
Terrace House: Boys and Girls in the City,[removed]
Terrace House: Boys and Girls in the City,Neat. Can't wait.
Terrace House: Boys and Girls in the City,S3 taking so long to drop and in 3 chunks makes me just give up on it. It's not as good as Amphibia or GF but it sucks S3 is getting such a shit treatment.
Terrace House: Boys and Girls in the City,Didn’t they cancel it?
Terrace House: Boys and Girls in the City,I would also argue that the latter half of S2 was as true an heir to the good episodes of Buffy as I've seen. The sense of genuine desperation against the terribly high stakes hits that same bittersweet note.
Terrace House: Boys and Girls in the City,"It's very weird to me how persistently iTunes Canada, specifically, leaks *everything*, from Disney shows to indie albums. I used to be a music blogger, when that existed, and they were *notorious* for it even then."

Terrace House: Boys and Girls in the City,"Well deserved.

I for one am so happy they didn't mess with the story.  Too many adaptations just do lip service to the source material and end up being completely different.  This just upsets the existing fanbase, especially when the adaptation is bad to boot.    Here they had a stellar story and didn't mess with it often recreating scenes that were near identical to the game.    It was so awesome seeing it come to life without significant changes other than cutting things for brevity.    

Here's hoping they do the second game similar justice as it's story is just as worthy of being adaptated straight up though I can see how they might tinker with way they tell the story in that they'll show the stories of the dual protagonists at the same time rather than separately."
Terrace House: Boys and Girls in the City,"Discovery really underestimated HBO, I hope this means that they aren't going to try and control more in the merger and still take risks on shows."
Terrace House: Boys and Girls in the City,"You know what's the best feeling in the world after every good news about this show? 

It's knowing that the salt mine that is The Last of Us 2 subreddit are seething with hate. Absolutely love it. 

Good news. Can't wait for season 2."
Terrace House: Boys and Girls in the City,"HBO needs to pick up the Witcher man, which they won’t do because they have Westeros, but I still dream of what could have been"
Terrace House: Boys and Girls in the City,"TLOU is a rare example of a big production team having respect and understanding for the source material. Most of the time, Hollywood follows the business model of  taking a generic script and sticking a known IP in it to gain publicity (see- Halo TV)."
Terrace House: Boys and Girls in the City,"I played the game a couple times. Once on ps3 and then ps4. But I didn’t it so long ago I was able to watch the show and not know exactly what was going to happen scene to scene or what was change or the same. The game definitely has you feeling more attached to Ellie and Joel together as you play as Joel and it’s your job to keep Ellie safe. So some of the stuff in the show didn’t hit the same. Also, I found when I played the game I sided with Joel almost fully. Like he was doing the the wrong thing for the right reasons. But being removed from controlling him and watching it play out on a tv show, I feel I got the intended effect. And it definitely makes Last of Us part II more obvious how that plays out."
Terrace House: Boys and Girls in the City,"Damn. This is impressive.

Imagine how Halo show could’ve been if they actually respected the lore."
Terrace House: Boys and Girls in the City,The writing has been superb.
Terrace House: Boys and Girls in the City,"I liked TLOU wayyy more than HOTD and I’m saying this as someone who loves GOT and who didn’t play the TLOU game.

TLOU felt way more streamlined and easier to follow. Maybe it’s like not really comparable as they’re different thematically and stylistically, but I remember numerous times during HOTD being like “who’s that guy again?” Or “why are they doing this again?”

TLOU is solid storytelling and great acting. Coming into it with no background, my wife and I thoroughly enjoyed ourselves far more."
Terrace House: Boys and Girls in the City,It’s a copycat industry so be on the lookout next year for the newest video game adaptation series: Turok Dinosaur Hunter on Showtime
Terrace House: Boys and Girls in the City,Praise Druckmann. Well deserved achievement. It goes without saying that TLOU Season 1 has probably surpassed viewership records for Game of Thrones Season 1 when it first aired as well
Terrace House: Boys and Girls in the City,"It’s a good show. The ending felt rushed and a bit of a flop for my wife who didn’t play the games. I think they could have done better with Joel thinking about everything, slap in a ton of flash backs and actually show the action more. 10 more minutes would have been great."
Terrace House: Boys and Girls in the City,This is the way.
Terrace House: Boys and Girls in the City,It’s because House of the Dragon didn’t cast Pedro Pascal
Terrace House: Boys and Girls in the City,So for the fifth straight year some very vocal people who told me a show or a movie was going to bomb for being too woke were wrong? Say it ain't so....
Terrace House: Boys and Girls in the City,"They really have to stretch. HOTD still had more peak viewers, but to make TLOU look better they have to go to ""full season viewers"".

Isn't it enough that TLOU did good? HOTD had almost 2 million more viewers on air date."
Terrace House: Boys and Girls in the City,"I must applaud the show's comittement to the source material, but the execution left me wanting. I didn't enjoy it nearly as much as HotD.

Ellie not being able to swin paid off with her nearly drowning while trying to reach the hospital near the end of the game, but that was cut from the story. Instead we got a flashback, which explains why Ellie is immune, which undermines why it has to be Ellie that needs to die in order to produce a cure. 

Action setpiece, tense sequences where you sneak past Clickers, or move through spore-filled underground tunnels (which wouldn't work anyway, given how they changed the cordiceps), the show could have used more of those."
Terrace House: Boys and Girls in the City,House of the Dragon season 2 and Last of Us season 2 are going to pull huge numbers is what you're telling me. HBO wins on both counts.
Terrace House: Boys and Girls in the City,"While the show has been strong I feel like they’re making changes to make part 2 make more sense. So much deconstructing of Joel as a strong survivalist. Too much Ellie making jabs at Joel and not enough of Ellie and Joel bonding. It took 6+ episodes before we got any survival bonding. This show feels rushed and it feels like Druckman is changing so much just to make part 1 make part 2 make sense. Part 2 made so little sense vs part 1. 

I haven’t hated this but as I went through this show it got worse and worse imo. I am not looking forward to the less well received part of the Last of Us getting more love. This first season has felt rushed in ways."
Terrace House: Boys and Girls in the City,"Great HBO, now do oryx and crake!"
Terrace House: Boys and Girls in the City,HoTD > TLoU
Terrace House: Boys and Girls in the City,"Don’t care, HOT D still better 👍

TLOU was pretty good but it didn’t really blow me away. A nice 7/10 show, maybe 8. Was never gripped like I was watching my Targ friends weekly"
Terrace House: Boys and Girls in the City,"Kid asked me why did Marlene task a single man to deliver Ellie across the country when she managed to teleport there before them with a big armed crew?

I didn't know what to say"
Terrace House: Boys and Girls in the City,"Man, I really hope HBO picks up a good Sci Fi IP. That would be the ultimate trio.

Bring back FIREFLY please"
Terrace House: Boys and Girls in the City,"Its almost like HOTD becoming popular brought in more viewers for this show to do even better  🤔

This is why making well written content matters."
Terrace House: Boys and Girls in the City,Bring back WestWorld!
Terrace House: Boys and Girls in the City,"I never played the game or seen anyone do it.
So i didnt know what to expect when i started watching this series.
After the 2 first episodes i pre-ordered the PC release for the las of us, after 5 episodes i jumped on youtube and watched jacksepticeyes playtrough of the last of us 2.

I don't know why i never bothered earlier, but goddamn this is some good shit."
Terrace House: Boys and Girls in the City,God I Hope so
Terrace House: Boys and Girls in the City,Well deserved. The Last of Us is the better show with better source material and audiences clearly agree with that sentiment
Terrace House: Boys and Girls in the City,How the hell?
Terrace House: Boys and Girls in the City,"Unpopular opinion but to me this show was way overrated. Boring, characters making dumb decisions, like walking around unattentive. I enjoyed Raised by Wolves and From much more."
Terrace House: Boys and Girls in the City,"As an experiment in turning a video game into a show, I thought The last of us was really great sometimes. The last episode however, did not work for me at all."
Terrace House: Boys and Girls in the City,Pascal Power.
Terrace House: Boys and Girls in the City,Now get the rights to Red Dead Redemption. Adapt the 2nd game first and then the 1st.
Terrace House: Boys and Girls in the City,"The most overhyped tv show I've ever seen. Just wait, it's not even going to be close to House of the Dragon in terms of award nominations"
Terrace House: Boys and Girls in the City,I'm happy these two shows got made but at the same time it makes it hurt even more seeing things like Wheel of Time and The Witcher with c tier writers with no respect for the source material.
Terrace House: Boys and Girls in the City,"And people try to say that hbo is the worst streaming platform. HBO is by far the highest standard when it comes to making quality content, it’s not even close."
Terrace House: Boys and Girls in the City,Is the season over yet? Can I pay for one month of HBO and watch it all at once?
Terrace House: Boys and Girls in the City,if only they did halo correctly.
Terrace House: Boys and Girls in the City,"hey, i didn’t have time to follow the show this last month, was it good?  did it feel like a video game movie addaptation?"
Terrace House: Boys and Girls in the City,[deleted]
Terrace House: Boys and Girls in the City,It was pretty lame compared to HOTD.
Terrace House: Boys and Girls in the City,Its a much better show so thats great
Terrace House: Boys and Girls in the City,Good
Terrace House: Boys and Girls in the City,"Excellent, TLOU was so much better."
Terrace House: Boys and Girls in the City,"Why does anyone care about this kind of thing? If it’s good it’s good, do we really need to know who’s watching which more?"
Terrace House: Boys and Girls in the City,"It's a bit like comparing the heights of new NBA players to Minut Bol.  They are all frigging giants.

I'm just impressed that HBO has managed to keep its quality > quantity in an era that seems to be all going the latter (at least in terms of it's original scripted content, not so much the streaming service licensed content)."
Terrace House: Boys and Girls in the City,The nice part about The Last of Us compared to House of the Dragon is that you can see things on your TV screen when you watch it.
Terrace House: Boys and Girls in the City,Good. It was better.
Terrace House: Boys and Girls in the City,"Well deserved. 

Craig Mazen does it again"
Terrace House: Boys and Girls in the City,"Well deserved. Great casting, even greater writers."
Terrace House: Boys and Girls in the City,Deserved. It's a better show.
Terrace House: Boys and Girls in the City,"That’s crazy, as HotD was loads better, imo. It even came from the public falling out that was Got season 8."
Terrace House: Boys and Girls in the City,"No surprise. HOTD was a pretentious, often boring disappointment. TLOU wasn't perfect but at least met my high expectations."
Terrace House: Boys and Girls in the City,I honestly didn’t like house of the dragon but loved TLOU but that’s just my opinion
Terrace House: Boys and Girls in the City,Was it really THAT good???
Terrace House: Boys and Girls in the City,"Hype is a powerful thing.

I watched it all and thought it was okay. The game is superior."
Terrace House: Boys and Girls in the City,"Almost as if respecting the source material has its pay offs. While HOTG’s been doing great job at sticking near the source material, the fuck up that was Game of Thrones season 8, has tarnished the brand’s reputation. IMHO."
Terrace House: Boys and Girls in the City,My favorite thing about The Last of Us is that there were no late night misunderstandings that dropped the entire European country into a bloody war and made a family slowly kill each other over the course of decades which resulted in one of their descendants losing it 270 years down the line and burning a city down :)
Terrace House: Boys and Girls in the City,"That's because ""The Last of Us"" wasn't a mediocre show trying its damnedest to ride the hype of a show that came out ten years ago."
Terrace House: Boys and Girls in the City,Now let's get them to do an Uncharted series on HBO. Can Craig do comedy?
Terrace House: Boys and Girls in the City,Good. Screw Game of Thrones and everything that spawned from it in the cinematic spectrum. They did us so freaking dirty with that last season.
Terrace House: Boys and Girls in the City,"I couldn't finish HotD, got to episode 5 dragging my feet. I watched TloU every Sunday night, it was a better show for me personally, but I think my opinion is from a biased perspective, I played the game, but never read the story about HotD so felt less invested"
Terrace House: Boys and Girls in the City,It's a vastly better show
Terrace House: Boys and Girls in the City,Not surprised.  House of the Dragon was awful
Terrace House: Boys and Girls in the City,I dropped off hard with House of Dragons. I got to episode 8 and just forgot about it.
Terrace House: Boys and Girls in the City,"This season felt so rushed

Episode 3 spent too much time away from Joel and Ellie. That episode being longer than the finale is a shame

The lack of infected is a damn shame

Walking dead season 1 was much better"
Terrace House: Boys and Girls in the City,"HoD sucks donkey balls.
That’s why."
Terrace House: Boys and Girls in the City,"I didn't care for house of the dragon. Just didn't grab me. I feel like the only one. On the other hand, I loved TLOU."
Terrace House: Boys and Girls in the City,Not watching any gOt spin-offs as revenge for season 8
Terrace House: Boys and Girls in the City,I couldn’t get into either show. I think I’m over GOT and zombie type shit. I’d like to see more dramas about real life again. Plus that girl in The Last of Us just makes me want to turn of my television.
Terrace House: Boys and Girls in the City,It was better.
Terrace House: Boys and Girls in the City,It's worth pointing out that HotD went up head to head with NFL football
Terrace House: Boys and Girls in the City,"fuck that game of thrones lite boring ass bullshit

this isnt even close"
Terrace House: Boys and Girls in the City,HotD is the definition of mid and I'm tired of holding my tongue
Terrace House: Boys and Girls in the City,This always ends each episode with a “OH NO!’ It’s always a long week until the next episode!
Timmy Time,"Comparing it to the highly rated animated shows today (Adventure Time, Steven Universe, etc), how would you say JN holds up?"
Timmy Time,"That was a great read. Thanks for reminding me of one of my favourite shows growing up. I always loved the Stranded episode and the Power Hour Fairy Oddparents crossovers.    
I think I'll start borrowing [this reaction image](http://i.imgur.com/PXIuWfT.png) if you don't mind."

edit: wrong link"
Timmy Time,"I've been an enormous fan of Jimmy Neutron for over 10 years; as a lonely 13 year-old I latched onto the idea of a group of kids going on adventures, slowly becoming friends, and eventually becoming a family.  I began writing Jimmy Neutron fanfiction once I'd seen all the episodes, and this is what got me into writing.  I'll always be thankful to Jimmy Neutron for not only helping me develop my writing skills (I hope to be an accomplished author / screenwriter one day) but also explore the childhood I felt I missed out on by using these characters in situations I invented.

I'm really glad you mentioned how Cindy and Libby become part of the group over the show's three seasons, plus the fact that this show has continuity and character development.  These are all things that made me love the show as a kid and appreciate it more as an adult.

I was also really interested in Jimmy and Cindy might have picked up some of each other's characteristics.  Jimmy became a little angrier and Cindy a little more playful / relaxed.  That's an interesting idea.

If you (or anyone reading this) wants more info on Jimmy Neutron, I've written a lot about it on my blog.  I'll post some links to that and my fanfics below; I always love to hear what people think of my thoughts on the show and discuss the show with them.  

Unfortunately, the chances of Jimmy Neutron coming back in any form are extremely low.  A couple years ago, I worked with Director Mike Gasaway and creator Keith Alcorn, as well as a couple writers from the show, to get a fourth season made with myself and a few other aspiring screenwriters on the writing crew.  It was a long and very rewarding journey, although Nick ultimately turned us down.

[Fanfics](https://www.fanfiction.net/u/851789/quietthinker) (I recommend checking out Last Call, A Trip to Loch Ness, Scattering Ashes, Fireflies, & The Final Battle Series.  The older stuff isn't that great.)

Timmy Time,"I'd personally say it holds up pretty well. It's probably not as good as this ""golden age of cartoons"" we're apparently in, but it was fun and had nice character development and overarching story"
Timmy Time,"I'm not very practiced in objective criticism, but I'll give it a shot. Sorry if I overdid it.

In terms of entertaining kids, I'd say it's great. It's fast paced, action packed, and fairly imaginative. It's full of that kiddy boy-girl drama that kids are likely exploring at that age, but not too much. The kids are all very immature, and the story writers do a lot with it. Even most of the adults are immature. The kids on the show are almost always faced with real emotional problems that the viewers can relate to. I noticed it's clever at times with taking advantage of kids' short attention spans. A specific example: When Jimmy and Cindy have that moment on the island where they can't remember why they used to fight so much, as a kid I remember trying and failing myself to remember why since that seemed like so long ago. As an adult, I remember all of it since it feels like it only happened a minute ago. It's very spontaneous and random, which is mostly Sheen's department. Each episode actually ranges widely in terms of adventure. Sometimes they're selling candy, and sometimes they're exploring a planet. It's very good about making you wonder what's going to happen next. The comedy is frequent and pretty well suited for the age of viewer they're going for. I even had a few good laughs.

In terms of creating a believable world, I'd say it's pretty good. The characters are very loud half the time, and almost always full of emotion. The characters have thoughts, feelings, desires, problems, and all those good, believable character attributes. To be honest, I really do wish Jimmy and Cindy were real. The constant yelling and arguing between the two did get a little obnoxious, but I was aware of the deeper meaning behind it, even as a child, so I learned to enjoy it. Every character has a very distinguishable personality which makes them highly memorable. The story lines for each episode are usually, but not always, pretty basic. I really enjoyed the occasional long episode full of real adventures where the characters grow and learn as people. The overall story, while kind of a small one relative to everything else that goes on, I would have to say is the main characters' general maturation over the series, and the main focus is on love. The JN formula (Jimmy uses brain to create then solve problem) is pretty much adhered to, but there are some surprises here and there. Some of the interactions can get a little corny at times (even as a kid I thought so), but it's easy to get past. The show is riddled with 4th wall jokes, though (e.g. making a face at the viewer, which was the most used). I don't know why they made that decision, as it makes it kinda hard to stay immersed in the world. Although, I don't remember them at all when I was a kid. They must have just went over my head. In order to create a real sense of urgency when it's needed, they mostly kept the cartoon physics to a minimum. Although... there was that one time when the very Looney Toons, pitch black, perfectly round hole appeared by expanding out of nowhere on the ground in the middle of a jungle that someone falls through. [sigh...](http://i.imgur.com/rJZaQ6z.png) In this world they've created, all of the crazy impossible things that happen are explained by science and technology, which makes them awesome and relatable. That was just straight up lazy cartoon physics. (I suppose you could argue that Meldar spawned some kind of wormhole right there, but whatever.)

There did seem to be a few subtle sexual innuendos speckled about. Just for fun, I'll point out a questionable one: *Beautiful Gorgeous (a hint of the aforementioned corniness) compliments Jimmy on his big brain. Then Jimmy says, ""Yeah. Huh, it's pretty big."", while making a debatably suggestive [facial expression](http://i.imgur.com/PXIuWfT.png).* Then I'll point out probably the most explicit one in the series: *Jimmy says referring to Cindy, ""Goddard. X-ray the suspects clothes."" Then this [series of freeze frames](http://imgur.com/a/h6hpD) should explain the rest, especially if you pay attention to Sheen's reaction.* I'll just take this opportunity to point how very rare it is for Cindy to actually engage in physical violence against Nerdtron. Their abuse toward each other is almost exclusively verbal. I guess that's expected on a kid's show, but it doesn't seem to be entirely in character, at least for Cindy. Although, there was that one time when Cindy slapped Jimmy across the face in his own house for kissing her in Carl's dream.

**TL;DR: To answer your question, very well. I would show this to kids today along with current cartoons.**"
Timmy Time,"Thanks. I love this show. I love it mostly for nostalgia reasons, but also because it's an awesome show. 

If you liked that one, then you might like [this one](http://i.imgur.com/1tcF3Ur.png). This is the second time Jimmy gets kissed by April, and she tells him that it was a kiss as opposed to a Gorlockan seal of trust."
Timmy Time,"Wow, Thanks. I'll definitely look into it."
Timmy Time,"> I was also really interested in Jimmy and Cindy might have picked up some of each other's characteristics. Jimmy became a little angrier and Cindy a little more playful / relaxed.

Wow. I hadn't thought of it that way actually. I was only seeing it in a negative light, but now I think it's really fitting. 

> I always love to hear what people think of my thoughts on the show and discuss the show with them.

That sounds like fun. :)

Thanks for the links."
Timmy Time,NO! Just no. ...ok maybe. 
Timmy Time,"You might be referring to [This post](http://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/38smox/so_i_just_got_done_reliving_a_large_chunk_of_my/). I put it there first, but then I thought this would be a better spot."

Cool. Good luck with the drawing thing. I'm pretty sure I can't draw anything better than a stick figure.

Edit: Oh yeah, and check out the subreddit /r/Jimmy_Neutron. It's very small right now, but maybe it will get bigger."
Timmy Time,"If you consider the story arc of the series to be the relationship between Jimmy and Cindy, then I would say it ended on a very satisfying note. Although, it teases you painfully with the potential for so much more story that's just begging to be written. Maybe that's just me.

If you're going to watch it, make sure you watch Lady Sings the News last. In fact, if you care about the order of all the episodes (I do), then use [this](http://nickelodeon.wikia.com/wiki/The_Adventures_of_Jimmy_Neutron:_Boy_Genius_episode_list).

Timmy Time,Wait are people really calling the current age the golden age? I enjoy most of the current toons but we are nowhere near calling it a golden age. 
Timmy Time,[deleted]
Timmy Time,"Yeah I've actually heard multiple people call the current era of animation a ""golden age"". And I agree, I don't think we're in a golden age. Still awesome cartoons, but not a golden age"
Timmy Time,Any other suggestions to go along with it? My mom loved broadchurch and is looking for some other similar things. 
Timmy Time,"Thanks for the recommendation! I actually like my crime series slightly understated, so this might be good. "
Timmy Time,I love this show! I can't wait for season 3 either!
Timmy Time,If there's no sex or violence i can't imagine it's a good detective show.  Crimes hang on those sort of things
Timmy Time,"I reccomend Kenneth Branagh's Wallander. It's a British adaptation of a Swedish Book Series. A little grimmer in tone, and mildly more graphic but similar. "
Timmy Time,Thank you for liking this!
Timmy Time,Thanks! Isn't it hype
Timmy Time,Watch Unforgettable. Maybe you'll be surprised.
Timmy Time,Oh it's so well written. The last episode of the second season tore my heart out. The acting was excellent!
Timmy Time,"Lol you've already forgotten the title of the show. Is it Unforgotten like in your original post, or Unforgettable as you stated here? "
Timmy Time,It's really a humanist and moving show. It's very much unlike any other mystery show in how emotional it is. I'm always a wreck after watching it.
Timmy Time,Unforgotten
Timmy Time,"Rules of Engagement just barely made it season to season after the first two or three. Not helping was the fact that it had a new timeslot or even day every season and in the end was even eventually moved to Saturdays.
      
I remember seeing a new episode appear on the DVR and going ""Oh shit, they didn't cancel it yet?"" That was pretty much the general consensus at the time. Mainly because, during the last two or three seasons it wasn't even on every week, sometimes taking 2-3 weeks between new episodes.
      
It's a great and I think somewhat underrated show (Could be biased because I adore Patrick Warburton) and I'm truly surprised it lasted as many seasons as it did. At least the ending was nice."
Timmy Time,Well it made it seven seasons and it was the natural ending point imo. Cancelled or not I think ti was a good time to end.
Timmy Time,Agreed seeing 1 more 1/2 season would have been interesting but the good thing is that it never jumped.   I'm glad I get to enjoy the syndication episodes. 
Timmy Time,"Idk it's such a great show and should have had more season, every time I watch it I get sad when I get to the last episode and know there are no more."
Timmy Time,"did it!? i think the show is very underrated i much prefer it to HIMYM. I love Patrick too because of his role in Emperors new groove as Kronk 'the meathead' lol Would've been nice to see what happens with timmy and russell, and jeff and audrey after the baby and their subsequent gay marriage lol :/ same with friends i guess after ross and rachel finally got together and chandler and monica move house. "
Timmy Time,"I honestly was impressed by how long it lasted. It always felt like a filler show. Entertaining but filler. 


And I agree Patrick Warburton is underrated. "
Timmy Time,I think I just would have liked one season with Audrey and Jeff with their kid. Also to see how the marriage between Russell and Timmy would work out. I'm happy we got as much as we did though. 
Timmy Time,Although the characters you name were good (actually I don't like russell much) the dumb pretty couple was a huge liability.
Narcos,that’s ironic given (partly) what the show is about…
Narcos,¿Dónde está la plata?
Narcos,Good old Hollywood accounting by Hollywood guys.
Narcos,What is this?  AMC?
Narcos,"he made that dreadful Robocop remake, he deserves to pay for that. Jk, this is shit if real"
Narcos,"I think there is a lot of shady shit going on at Netflix and other streaming services when it comes to money.  
   
It's very hard to define profits, revenue etc. And much easier to conceal/move some stuff that it would be for traditional theater/broadcast releases."
Narcos,o plomo
Narcos,"I mean, he wanted to make that Robocop film match Narcos and his Tropa de Elite movies (those films are brutal btw).  Gritty realism and extreme violence, social themes, and cops versus criminals are things he has long explored well.  In typical Hollywood fashion, the studio execs stamped down on Robocop, much to his frustration."
Narcos,Netflix didn't produce Narcos though.
Narcos,"They were/are the main distributor, so most of the money goes through them or is affected by their statistics etc.  
   
But like I said, I was talking about streaming in general."
Narcos,"I'd love to see a season focused on ""The French Connection"" and a follow up past that in a following season to the Frank Lucas era.

We have a whole other ""drug"" war from the 60s and 70s to explore.

Also do we know enough about Tse Chi Lop to explore ""The Asian El Chapo"" ?"
Narcos,">Or even drug trafficking into Europe by the prominent Mafias there.

A high school student makes crystal meth and sells it at school. A special team of police officers who look like teenagers go undercover."
Narcos,I'd like to see a season set during the Vietnam war when heroine was being smuggled into the country in solder's coffins.
Narcos,"This month **Narcos-Saints** premiered on Netflix. It's a korean show about a Korean drug boss in the South American country Suriname.

It's loosely based on real events of the life of real drug boss Jo Bong Haeng. Jo is said to have created a channel of drug smuggling and supply in the 1990s while he was in Suriname. He was arrested in 2009 in a joint investigation by South Korea, Brazil and the United States."
Narcos,The blonde American actor from season 1 of Narcos being in Netflix’s The Sandman made me realize I never finished this show! And now I plan on going back and watching
Narcos,"As a Brazilian, I would like to see a show focused on São Paulo in the 1990s and early 2000s. That's when the largest Brazilian criminal organization was founded.

HBO did a great documentary about this. It was released a few months ago on HBO Max Latin America. (edit: it was released in the US as *PCC, Secret Power*)"
Narcos,"A story about this guy would be awesome
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khun_Sa"
Narcos,What I'd like to see is what was actually going on in the CIA during this time.
Narcos,"triads or Yakuza, need me some Asian trafficking"
Narcos,Frank Larry Matthews (aka Black Ceaser). I'm a bit amazed theres never been a big production about him. He was bigger than Frank Lucas.
Narcos,A show where we actually see how Escobar started snuggling. The show glossed over the entire thing
Narcos,"I've heard Sacred Games is like an Indian Narcos, and even though it's not based on a true story you could possibly enjoy that if what they say is true."
Narcos,I came here to recommend ZeroZeroZero too. Such an amazing show.
Narcos,"No meth, but Extracurricular is about a teen prostitution broker."
Narcos,"We're reviving a canceled undercover police program from the '80s and revamping it for modern times. You see the guys in charge of this stuff lack creativity and are completely out of ideas, so all they do now is recycle sh*t from the past and expect us all not to notice

“Deputy Chief Hardy-21 Jump Street”"
Narcos,"> Netflix’s The Sandman

Ohhh that's where i know him from"
Narcos,">	The blonde American actor 


Put some god damn respect [Boyd Holbrook’s](https://m.imdb.com/name/nm2933542/?ref_=m_ttfcd_cl2) name. He’s earned it."
Narcos,It would be funny if they cast a Colombian to play a Brazilian main character.
Narcos,">A show where we actually see how Escobar started snuggling.

Do you want to see him snuggle with his wife or with his mistress?"
Narcos,Yea it was just hinted at the first episode. Kind of like a prequel of sorts I guess
Narcos,"The Mexican parts were awesome, the USA/Italian parts were lacking in comparison. But a really good overall"
Narcos,"Colombian*

*sigh*"
Narcos,Preferably with El Cuddlio
Narcos,"No, I was referring to an inhabitant of the city in South Carolina :-)

A proud city with a history of public drunkenness, gambling and poor sanitation (this is actually true, the city put it on their website)."
Narcos,"> Diego Calva is about to get his big Hollywood break as the star of Damien Chazelle’s upcoming epic “Babylon,” but Netflix subscribers might already be familiar with the relative newcomer thanks to his supporting role on “Narcos: Mexico.” **Calva starred as the Mexican drug lord Arturo Beltran Leyva in six episodes of the show’s third season**, but it appears he’s not too fond of the series. Speaking to GQ magazine, **Calva said he disagrees with how “Narcos: Mexico” represented his country.**


> “**There’s a moment in your career as an actor that you really can’t choose your roles,” Calva said. “You are just grateful that you’re having a job, and ‘Narcos’ is a great show.** But in my case, it’s a little hard because **the way they put the story of my country, I don’t agree at all. There’s a lot of truth and that’s amazing, but there’s a lot of lies, too.**”


> “**I think my country doesn’t need more narco culture and making these guys heroes,” Calva said**, adding that when the show aired on Netflix he remembered thinking to himself, “This is too raw. I don’t know if I really want to keep shooting people.”

> **“Narcos: Mexico,” a companion series to Netflix’s “Narcos,” ran for three seasons and dramatized the true story of Mexico’s illegal drug trade.** The series starred Diego Luna and Michael Peña in leading roles."
Narcos,I think that's a fair opinion to have but as the Cunninglynguists said America Loves Gangstas. The mobster/narco trafficante stories will be eternally popular. The Wire ended almost 20 years ago and Baltimore *still* has that shadow looming over it.
Narcos,Is there gonna be next season?
Narcos,"there's a fucking Narcos Mexico 3? what, when??"
Narcos,I feel like I miss out on The Wire.
Narcos,"Third season was the last of Narcos Mexico, but the producers are working on a new series starring Sofia Vergara as Griselda Blanco."
Narcos,No. Season 3 was the [final season of ‘Narcos: Mexico’.](https://deadline.com/2021/09/narcos-mexico-ending-season-3-netflix-premiere-date-first-look-photos-teaser-released-1234831990/)
Narcos,it’s never too late.
Narcos,Did someone forget to pay the war tax? :P
Narcos,Plata o hidden profits
Narcos,Well this show is done.
Narcos,What do you mean
Narcos,"when production partners start suing eachother, the writing is on the wall and its written in blood"
Narcos,"But it was already released, how much more done can it get"
Narcos,how many more episodes will there be for this season?
Narcos,"Next week: Performer of the week: Pedro Pascal in The last of us AND in The Mandalorian.

Can’t await it"
Narcos,Makes sense. The scene with Tommy in that shop probably secured this. Amazing acting.
Narcos,"According to the official companion podcast, the ""when I wake up...I've lost something,"" line was actually thought up by Pedro.

That line and, ""I'm failing in my sleep,"" were just gut punches to me."
Narcos,"Dude is fucking killing it, and so is the rest of the cast. They could give this award every week to someone from this show."
Narcos,It’s funny how you could just pick any performer from any episode as a potential performance of the week. The show is a really great vehicle for any actor to show off their chops.
Narcos,"Love how they're making Joel so much more human in this show. I had no problem with how his issues were handled in the game, but the execution in the show has been next-level."
Narcos,"His line about his dreams was heartbreaking, and as someone who suffers from nightmares constantly, I found it very moving."
Narcos,Pedro Pascal in Narcos was masterpiece.

Narcos,"Damn this dude is *everywhere*

And it’s amazing"
Narcos,"Meta comment about these Performer of the Week posts:

It seems pretty naive of a spoiler-phobic person to enter a PotW thread feeling like they are safe from spoilers on the latest episode of the show in the post title. That is clearly the thread's discussion scope.

Per [sub rules:](https://old.reddit.com/r/television/wiki/rules)

>Untagged spoilers in comments are allowed depending on the context of the thread's title"
Narcos,"When he was first cast as Joel, I was totally against it. Nothing against his talent, I was just trapped in the ridiculous “he doesn’t resemble the video game character” mentality. I’ve been eating my words ever since. He’s fucking outstanding."
Narcos,Well deserved. I hope he submit this episode for the Emmy because he deserves one.
Narcos,Up there with episode three with the best acting in the series thus far. They are truly honoring this story with this adaptation
Narcos,Next week : Pedro pascal in the mandalorian lol
Narcos,I'm failing in my sleep.
Narcos,Pedro is quickly becoming one of my favorite actors.
Narcos,“I’m failing in my sleep” really hurt.
Narcos,How come no ones talking about how Pedro Pascal is the modern Burt Reynolds?
Narcos,TOMMY
Narcos,I'm so glad he's getting recognition. Truly phenomenal actor & a charismatic Person!
Narcos,"HBO is gonna be pretty much the winner award season

They got White lotus,we all know succession will win again,HOTD,and now last of us,most of the other shows might as well go home in the drama category

it sucks we wont see TLOU till 2025 or beyond now tho"
Narcos,Amazing work by Pascal thus far. Here's hoping next week gives us a Bella Ramsey performer of the week.
Narcos,"Dudes in his prime, I see him taking a long break soon though. His output has been crazy the past few years"
Narcos,Bro the scene with Tommy in the shop while wholly different in tone from his speech in the game was wow. I felt so bad for him dear lord. Then the convo before that in the bar was *mwah* fricken “I guess we’ll find out.” And Tommy’s response was amazing.
Narcos,His SNL episode was one of the funniest in a long time! He’s such a chameleon.
Narcos,This dude was the perfect casting choice.
Narcos,I feel like Pedro is one of those rare actors-and people- that brings out the best in everyone around him.
Narcos,"I was super annoying about watching it because I thought it wouldn’t do the game justice, but holy smokes was I wrong"
Narcos,I want Pedro Pascal to play my Daddy.
Narcos,"I wasn’t familiar with his work prior or him as an actor all together and went into this show blind,  I think he’s been knocking it completely out of the park."
Narcos,His best performance in anything I’ve seen him in.
Narcos,"I think Nick Offerman deserves a ton of praise for his work a few episodes back, too. I thought it was a remarkable performance."
Narcos,I’m sure as hell not your dad
Narcos,"I laugh at the YouTubers crying that they made Joel soft by having him cry and have ptsd and never actually opening up about being scared and heart broken.. like it’s his brother who he hasn’t seen in a while and he hasn’t been able to process Tess, plus his daughter…. 

I felt for him at that moment."
Narcos,"Well, he became a popular meme this week, so I'd say well deserved lol"
Narcos,everyone go back and watch Prospect!
Narcos,"Man, for all the critical acclaim this show is getting, it's a good thing it's not on Netflix or someone would have been fired for not canceling it by now."
Narcos,TV line promoting views for their site for ad impressions. Pretty solid formula since it will always pick favorites
Narcos,"Dudes in his prime, I see him taking a long break soon though. His output has been crazy the past few years"
Narcos,I know I’ll get downvoted but I can’t get into this show. I love the game but the show just seems so off to me and I can’t put my finger on what it is exactly
Narcos,Still not as great as he was as Inigo in The Princess Bride. [Sauce](https://youtu.be/29s1yU3nGkQ?t=6m23s) for anybody who hasn't seen it. Worth a watch from beginning to end
Narcos,[deleted]
Narcos,The Last of Us is as boring as the Walking Dead became.
Narcos,Social media hype for this show seemed to have died down significantly. Viewership is still up though right?
Narcos,They turned Joel into a bitch
Narcos,"Honestly, I'm a big fan of Pedro but he's mailing it in as Joel. Bella is running laps around him as Ellie. She deserves the praise."
The Code,The age of the implication is over. The age of the echo chamber has just begun.
The Code,They cut out the best part at the end
The Code,"You can’t just cut out the last part hahaha
Everyone deserves to see that face"
The Code,Feel bad for the millennials nearing 40 lol always getting lumped in.
The Code,"Finger on the pulse, finger on the puss!"
The Code,I need to get back into this show.
The Code,Love when people post stuff from always sunny like the evolution argument and miss the point that all the characters are sociopathic monsters.
The Code,You should’ve put the whole clip lol
The Code,That's true the hive mind is real... Especially on Reddit.
The Code,The Dennis System 2.0
The Code,"This is actually a real conversational tool. Mirroring. And I do it all the time when people say something I don't really know how to respond to. I'll say it back to them, usually the last few words. Like a summary of what they just said. Most of the time they will continue to go on and hopefully give me something to work with. Works like a charm."
The Code,"Honestly one of the best bits of social commentary the show has ever delivered. This can be evidenced by attempting to have a dialogue about a current event on this very website. People have been conditioned to go to their respective corners and block out anything that may be contrary to their mindset, and this has made it impossible to inject nuance into conversations. 

If we largely insist on operating in bubbles of confirmation bias, then we lose our ability to function as a society."
The Code,Sounds like Reddit in a nutshell!
The Code,"It is hilarious watching the people in this thread worshiping this idea.

As soon as the characters say something they agree with they forget that IASIP is a show about terrible people and anything they say is dumb as shit.

If you ever find yourself agreeing with any of these characters its a sign that you need to reevaluate everything about yourself."
The Code,"I feel like this isn't meant to stand as some generational critique. It's supposed to read as Dennis being a psychopath who cannot understand this woman's sense of empathy. Sorta like when people talk about ""virtue signaling"", because they cannot even comprehend a world where people actually care."
The Code,Actress name?
The Code,"Dennis shouldn't be a beacon of generational relations.  It's good to laugh at him, but he should be right like a broken clock.  Twice a day.  

Are people in echo chambers?  Fucking right, they are.

But if Dennis is right all the time, then the viewer has crossed into Joker fanboy territory."
The Code,"""Generations"" aren't a real thing anyways. An older millennial, say age 41, is much more likely to be similar to a young gen x person aged 43 than they are a young millennial aged 27."
The Code,Who tf posts a Always Sunny clip and doesn’t include the Dennis O face?
The Code,It's like they were describing reddits user base.
The Code,Because of the *implication.*
The Code,Finally someone takes a shot at Millennials.
The Code,This was my favorite episode from this season.
The Code,ITT Millennials who are offended
The Code,"Basically Reddit in a nutshell.

Example:

Weekly posts of ‘omg Leftovers is so good’- ez Karma."
The Code,I'm sure everyone can appreciate this being uploaded to reddit - perhaps the greatest echo chamber of them all.
The Code,"I can't even. What can't I even? I don't know, but the kids tell me this is a thing."
The Code,"I think you mean Gen Z.

The Gang already are millennials..."
The Code,The nose ring 🤣
The Code,"The entire bit is flowing over most of the heads of the people in this thread

But sure “hur dur young people care too much”"
The Code,Generations are just astrological signs for redditors.
The Code,This entire subreddit is just my YouTube algorithm from last week
The Code,"Or, hot take, younger generations are just genuinely more empathetic than the generations that threw rocks at black school children."
The Code,Damn he looks old now
The Code,"Sadly, facts."
The Code,"Uh you know Dennis is intentionally wrong, right? This 'cracked code' is some old man dinosaur take on a younger generation."
The Code,Wanting to be seen as more ethical is better than not wanting to be seen as more ethical.
The Code,Dennis is a moron anyway
The Code,She think she a bull.
The Code,"Man. If anything tells me a show has lost it, it is bitching about younger people. Like fuck off Archie Bunker."
The Code,That sounds dangerously close to boomer logic to me
The Code,"The number of Gen Z's in this thread raging about ""boomer humor"" is really funny. Y'all take yourselves so seriously."
The Code,"I'm not a fan of that show, but I'll join in more explicitly. Fuck Wokeism."
The Code,Sounds like marriage
The Code,Didn't know Always Sunny was such a boomer show.
The Code,Scarily accurate
The Code,Still waiting for them to crack the code for making a good show after season 12.
The Code,"Nooo fuckingggg shittttt. 
I’m going to try this with my son.

Edit: Wtf. Sorry I did not know this was about sex..  I was only talking about the method of just saying exactly what the person says back to them   to make it seem like that you are listening and on there side.   
Lol. This is why I belong here…  I have to see the show now…"
The Code,Spot on. I bet a lot of people would laugh and be like “that’s what i’m like” without any awareness that they don’t have to just say whatever everyone else is saying. if you say argumentum ad populum they’d say “fuck you too.”
The Code,"Lol she’s too ~~old~~young to be a millennial. Guess millennial means group of people that OP doesn’t like. Boomer detected.

e:oops I meant too young"
The Code,"""Don't even understand half the shit that they're saying""

Says a fucking dumbass screaming about CRT at the top of their lungs because right wing media said so."
The Code,"As a Millenial, I really want to see Mr. Dennis Reynolds crack the Gen Z code."
The Code,"Did they film this multiple times with different girls?  I could have sworn it was a blonde when I saw it on Hulu the other day and she looked much younger, was a bit weird."
The Code,"Wow, she looks like a younger Pamela Adlon."
The Code,this belongs on r/GenX
The Code,"The super troopers ""repeaters"""
The Code,"all these people here, yet there isnt any links or debate on who she is??!!! HERETICS!!!"
The Code,"It applies to all generations and all people, except for politicians."
The Code,"Has he had plastic surgery? Giving me a real ""Ronaldo"" vibe."
The Code,This sounds oddly familiar in a very scary kind of way
The Code,She is a classic Reddit mod and Dennis is an average white male walking into Reddit.
The Code,"It's not ethical but when my ex started yammering on about things that made no sense, I'd keep like a three second loop of what she said, echo her statement, then discard.  Funnily enough, my bad behavior is not why we broke up."
The Code,Lolllolololllololo exactly! I Think I’ll deploy that tactic at every opportunity hilarious.
The Code,"Bruh you left out the best part, the pay off."
The Code,what episode is this?
The Code,Which episode?
The Code,What episode is this?
The Code,"As a male feminist, I find this clip extremely offensive and misogynistic"
The Code,How pathetic and predictable these people can be?
The Code,What episode is this? Looks like I’ve missed a few
The Code,What episode was this
The Code,Which episode is this from? I don’t remember this scene!
The Code,The age of the implication is over. The age of the echo chamber has just begun.
The Code,Should this be read in a creepy orc voice? https://youtu.be/R1x4JkZTfPs
The Code,Something's over and something started
The Code,Cut that cut that cut that
The Code,"Here:

https://youtu.be/uOVJ3zaQnYo"
The Code,"Interesting how the edit kind of redirects the satire. The edited version is being shared around to make fun of millennials, the actual scene is indicting selfish and cynical older generations."
The Code,Is it the return of Dennis' O-face?
The Code,"IKR  
https://youtu.be/uOVJ3zaQnYo"
The Code,I think officially the oldest millennials turn 42 this year and the youngest 26.
The Code,"Seriously, I'm turning 40 this year and technically a millennial. There was no such thing as social media until I was already in college. Us Xillennials are like a lost micro-generation."
The Code,"People think there are only 2 generations that exist right now; Millennials and Boomers. 

Millennial age range: 28 - 42 (born 1980 - 1994) 

In this scene, about 20 seconds earlier, there's a joke Where Denis says ""OLD!? I'm 26...""

This entire thing is just more ignorant circle jerking about millennials. 

*For those who don't understand, they're making fun of Gen Z. Nowhere does he say ""Millennial"" in the scene."
The Code,It’s also almost like Dennis is a terrible person. So the things he says are from point of view of a terrible person.
The Code,[deleted]
The Code,"The MORONS' rotten brains can't handle more than one label. They get flustered and panic if the see two or more, example: if they see Antifa and BLM in the same sentence, most of them have mini-heart attacks thinking WW3 started."
The Code,40 year old millennials have almost nothing in common with 26 year old ones. Technology and the way we grew up are so different. Generations need to be grouped in much smaller time periods. Things change much faster today.
The Code,Almost as though lumping people together based on what year they were born is as logical as Astrological signs
The Code,I'm pretty sure everyone on that show but danny devito is millenial.
The Code,Yeah it bs. These guys are only like five years older and they get to act like they're somehow superior
The Code,I’m 39 😩
The Code,"I feel bad that the generations most susceptible to propaganda keep accusing the younger generations of not knowing anything.

I mean, you’d think the people who grew up through the Civil Rights movement and the people who were disillusioned by the rampant corporatism of the ‘80s and early ‘90s would be more sympathetic to people being denied their civil liberties and indebted to oblivion, but no—*somehow* the younger generations’ ire at people’s rights being taken away and not being able to buy anything beyond living expenses means we’re “too thin-skinned and don’t appreciate the value of work.”

Seriously: you’d think age would give people wisdom to see that maybe—just *maybe*—the fact that none of the shit from the past is getting better has something to do with the people convincing suckers that “no, there’s nothing wrong with you. It’s those *other* people (who you should kick down on) responsible for the problems in this country.”"
The Code,"Yeah, are they not millennials? If they're gen x, they have to be the youngest batch of gen x"
The Code,"how about those of us already over 40... because yes if we go by the grounds millennials are 1980-1995, then there are 41-42 year old millennials out there."
The Code,Eewwwww
The Code,"God, the nose ring. It’s like a signal that you’re about to deal with a tremendous amount of bullshit."
The Code,The new season was great imo
The Code,"This show is brilliant, it's just getting better each season."
The Code,You should! The Ireland episodes were incredible and classic Sunny
The Code,This clip was one of the very few highlights of the most recent season. It’s pretty rough overall.
W1A,"It's an excellent comedy.  Have you also seen Twenty Twelve, which is by the same production team and features several of the same characters?"
W1A,"As an American, this is a super under the radar comedy.  It's super dry British comedy, narrated by David Tennant, with Hugh Bonneville.  It's hilarious, but I sometimes struggle to catch what they're saying with all their different accents."
W1A,And ripped off an australian show called The Games from (2000)
W1A,Can’t say that I have but lol definitely check it out
W1A,Yes exactly

W1A,"Andy Richter Controls the Universe. Paget Brewster alone would have been fantastic, but it was all gold. I have literally never met anyone IRL who's seen it. Felt way ahead of its time in terms of morally compromisable douchebag sitcoms, I think it looks far more at home next to Always Sunny or Arrested Development than it did next to anything of its own era.

Particularly big fan of the episodes where Byron accidentally becomes a pimp after giving some ladies financial advice and the one where they start doing poetry classes for prisoners and get competitive over their students when they realize there's a prize.

W1A,Easy! The norm show!
W1A,"I've always had a soft spot for Hi Honey, I'm Home. I thought it was very clever. Not brilliant of course, but fun."
W1A,"Don’t trust the B in apartment 23. great show, just have to remember watching it in the correct order. Even streaming has the episodes out of sync."
W1A,"I don't think it's underrated in this sub but maybe overall out there in the world but definitely **The Grinder**

But, what if it wasn't?"

Wilfred

Bored to Death

I forgot to add Detroiters"
W1A,"I LOVED NewsRadio, well the Phil Hartman episodes. Lovitz just couldn't fill the void :("
W1A,"NewsRadio is my number one. Also Living Single, Happy Endings, and Better of Ted."
W1A,"Julia won an Emmy for that. One time, same as the number she won for Seinfeld. She should have won more for Seinfeld, TBH. And then six for VEEP"
W1A,And an early lead role for Clark Gregg.
W1A,My mom still talks about how much she liked that show.  I only caught some pieces of episodes here and there but it was pretty solid.
W1A,"That was when I first became aware of Brett Gelman, and have been a fan ever since.  He's awesome."
W1A,Murder Board!
W1A,I thought The Mick was very unenjoyable
W1A,Bored to death is elite
W1A,"I remember this show getting critically panned at release but like, me and my mom loves watching it every week."
W1A,This is the first I've ever heard of this show. Will check it out.
W1A,I loved this show.  It had cultural racism issues I'm sure but it was just heartwarming and funny.
W1A,"If I recall, it got lost in the shuffle of NBC's loaded Thursday night. Hard to compete with the Office, 30 Rock, Community, and Parks"
W1A,The movie it was based on was far better. They really hammed it up and went over the top for the show.
W1A,Used to love watching reruns on USA. Was a better Ferris Bueller show than [Ferris Bueller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferris_Bueller_(TV_series\)).
W1A,"The relentless pace of jokes in that was like getting jumped into a gang. The whole bonkers universe was great, but W1A felt like they perfected it."
W1A,"young me liked Crystal Bernard with her southern accent, as a non-American I always thought it was cute and she seemed a nice mix of sweet and sexy to a teenage lad!"
W1A,"There aren't a lot of shows that my roommate and I watch together, but we watched this one every week. Idk what it was about that show, but we really enjoyed it!"
W1A,"Yes!!

I really really liked that, shame they cancelled it :/"
W1A,Ah-mahzing show!
W1A,Amazing show!!
W1A,South Side started on Comedy Central and didn't really pick up viewers until it moved to HBO. I guess that means the low viewership was due to people preferring streaming over cable.
W1A,"The best part of that show was the opening scenes, they always had me rolling."
W1A,"If you liked that check out Corporate and Review, both on CC around the same time and both hilarious"
W1A,Mindy was good and had a really fun ensemble but the romantic entanglement of Mindy and prick Italian doctor in her office was not good and did not play well on camera
W1A,Don't forget it also had Andy Dick!  But sometimes you gotta ignore the artist and enjoy the art.
W1A,How much more could it realistically get?  I think it’s a huge success by any metric.
W1A,Frankly I feel like Community is significantly *overrated* at this point.
W1A,"Really? This subreddit constantly sucks at the proverbial teat of Dan Harmon, this show in particular, that I've been finding its constant praise of *Community* to make it **over**rated, if anything.

^and ^that's ^not ^even ^getting ^into ^how ^quickly ^this ^sub ^forgave ^him ^for ^sexually ^harassing ^one ^of ^his ^writers ^compared ^to ^lesser-liked ^showrunners ^I ^said ^what ^I ^said"
W1A,"Underrated? We used to call it ""Unwatchable"""
W1A,"Oh yeah, he was magnificent in it!"
Heidi,"You're looking for ""America's Got Judges."" It's super boring."
Heidi,"Well you got one from North America and one from South America, so 2 Americans....."
Heidi,"In the early years of the 21 Century, few would have believed that the War of North American Union was to be fought over ownership of Howie Mandel."
Heidi,London is a country too?
Heidi,[deleted]
Heidi,"Makes since, most of the contestants aren't American either."
Heidi,I said this to my wife just yesterday.
Heidi,The actual Americans are mostly kept on reservations.  The rest of us are or came from interlopers anyway.
Heidi,Colombia*
Heidi,Curious why Simon got a city and everybody else got a country?
Heidi,All the foreign acts bother me.
Heidi,"But in Bobby's World, it makes total sense."
Heidi,"And England is a city. 

Sigh I just made a Jake Paul reference in 2022, I feel icky now."
Heidi,"well man believe me, it feels like one"
Heidi,"Not sure why people are downvoting    

Heidi Klum; born 1 June 1973)[6] is a German and American model, US/Ger citizen, she is American    

Howie Mandel is Canadian, lives in California.    

Sofía Margarita Vergara Vergara; born July 10, 1972)[1][2] is a Colombian and American actress and model, shes been here for over 20 years, she is American.    

You don't have to be born here to be considered ""American"""
Heidi,I was going to if you didn't.
Heidi,https://i.imgur.com/uellMwP.gifv
Heidi,Thank you for this. It’s disheartening to see comments that think you can never become an American if you were born someplace else.
Heidi,Tell that ICE.
Heidi,"She might not be everyone's favorite but Sarah Sherman is bringing some ""out of this world"" insanity to SNL that hasn't been around since the 70s."
Heidi,"Sounds like the normal cycle of the show.  The players from the last era leave, SNL sucks, people say the show is done.  Last generation's featured players become the main players and the new featured players both find their grooves.  SNL is solid again."
Heidi,"Wow, hard disagree. The sketch writing is straight up terrible this year. There have been a few decent hosts that have smoothed things over, but the show is hurting from losing a lot of their veterans."
Heidi,They're doing a pretty solid job despite all the turnover going into the season.
Heidi,"I think its the direct opposite. SNL is justso bad. It got so bad i only watch the few highlights of an episode on YouTube the last multiple years. Id only watch the cold open, maybe the monologue, & Weekend Update, but now it all just sucks!"
Heidi,"I think most of the cast and writers did find a groove. I would say it's a huge step up because I thought last year was generally good too.

Shout out as well to the Please Don't Destroy trio because all their stuff has been hits the last 2 years and it's cool seeing them get to expand on their sketches."
Heidi,"The general consensus is the opposite, the writing just is not that funny. Its either too safe or too weird for most people. Most the skits anymore and just rewrites of someones skit on Youtube or Tiktok that was seen earlier that week."
Heidi,Idk I feel this season has been sooo boring. The new cast members are very bland. Plus too many all black sketches
Heidi,"Disagree. Pedro Pascale episode was great… and… 

I mean Aubrey Plaza sucked. No good skits. How can you make Aubrey Plaza suck?

Headline News hasn’t been memorable either."
Heidi,I haven't seen her on SNL but if it's anything like her standup opening for Eric André I will be very pleased.
Heidi,"Ha, she's the only one I don't really like actually, and her Weekend Update segment doesn't do a thing for me. But I guess that person is needed."
Heidi,"Maybe I'm in the minority, but I didn't find the previous cast very strong at all at any point (and I don't consider myself the ""every cast sucks except the one when I was 13"" type). Aidy Bryant was great but really only starting to find her groove by the end, and I liked Pete even though he was barely used."
Heidi,Major SNL fan and agree this season skits have been lacking
Heidi,I have never not skipped the please don’t destroy sketches
Heidi,They weren't...? Seems like Heidi was in half the sketches
Heidi,Yeeeeee! Hunter the Hungry is gonna eat!
Heidi,I swear Kristen Schaal puts on a wig and uses an alias so we can live out her lifelong dream of being on SNL.
Heidi,"Chris Redd could be great if SNL learns how to write for him. I feel like his talent will go wasted. Heidi is great. She’s a funny character actor right now, and could turn into a lead actor with enough experience."
Heidi,"""Does Colin know?.."""
Heidi,"How do I know Chris Redd?  He looks familiar.  Was he in a movie?  
  
Edit : I remember!  He was in Popstar!"
Heidi,They deserve it. Funnier than half of the regulars already.
Heidi,"Not sure if it was just live tv jitters but Chris Redd was having a really difficult time reading his lines and getting through sketches all season. I really hope he gets more relaxed and enjoys his job, I think he has a lot of potential"
Heidi,Watch his portrayal of Kanye. I don’t think he even uses queue cards. Dude looked like a pro up there.
Heidi,I thought Gardner already was part of the regular cast. Could've fooled me.
Heidi,Ego deserves some love too!
Heidi,Heidi Gardner is my biggest tv crush since Al from Step by Step.
Heidi,That's great I hope they are featured a ton this year. Heidi might have the best presence of the whole cast.
Heidi,Heidi is a star
Heidi,Wait. They weren't already?!
Heidi,Chris Redd is a funny dude
Heidi,Cool!  Both of them are awesome!
Heidi,is kenan thompson a regular yet?
Heidi,"She is brilliant, goop skit is an all time great"
Heidi,"heidi is great. her ""every boxers girlfriend from every boxing movie ever"" character on weekend update kills me."
Heidi,Nice. Both are really good.
Heidi,"Chris Redd's ""Fighting in Chicago"" story is hilarious. [https://youtu.be/33fLisIFCas?t=61](https://youtu.be/33fLisIFCas?t=61)"
Heidi,"I don’t get Heidi, she seems one dimensional to me. But good for them"
Heidi,These two are industry picks already on a path for fame they deserve it.
Heidi,I don't dislike her or anything but Heidi is very much a one trick pony imo.
Heidi,That's great!
Heidi,I love Heidi. I thought she was already a regular though.
Heidi,who?
Heidi,They act as if viewers have any idea what the difference really is
Heidi,Hooray! Congratulations to them both! I wish them lots of success in the present and in the future!
Heidi,"Yes! Heidi is super talented, she never fails to get a laugh from me."
Heidi,Heidi has the best Weekend Update characters.
Heidi,Bout damn time
Heidi,"Step 1, promote the funny people.  Step 2, bye bye Lesie Jones!!!"
Heidi,SNL successfully fighting humour since the late 90's managing to stay consistently not funny for so many years.
Heidi,"I'm starting to come to the sad realization that Pete Davidson is still in the cast.  

Everytime I see one of these posts, I pray that Pete has left the show to ""pursue other opportunities""."
Heidi,That show has been absolute trash for years.
Heidi,Cool so does this mean we have to investigate their past now and make sure they never once said anything offensive or disparaging?
Heidi,Won’t help. SNL is garbage and hasn’t been funny in years.
Heidi,Just a reminder the Japanese Jeopardy sketch is still on the snl webpage.
Heidi,[deleted]
Heidi,YESSSSS!
Heidi,"Dope, heidi is great"
Heidi,[deleted]
Heidi,Heidi is awesome!!! Well deserved.
Heidi,"Heidi has stood out for a while now.  Glad to see her.  Chris Redd is solid but doesn't stand out for any specific characters.  Still, solid news all around.  Glad we are getting a few new characters.  If Ego does well again this season, I think she should get promoted next season."
Heidi,Who...? What? SNL is still on??
Heidi,Who?
Heidi,"Betcha the woke ""cancel"" folks won't bother trying to get either of *them* fired.  

Gee, I wonder why..."
Heidi,SNL has turned into such garbage. Haven’t watched it in years. Firing Shane was just another smear on the face of a once show.
Heidi,"This is my personal favorite

https://youtu.be/iyOCe8o6-gw"
Heidi,They waited too long on both accounts.
Heidi,"Chris Redd was amazing in the Roast of Baldwin I’m sure that helped a bit too, or was the plan. Either way stoked for both of them !"
Heidi,Has this guy done a Kanye sketch yet?
Heidi,*S T O M P I N G  T H R O U G H  T H E  F O R E S T  L I K E  A  R E T A R D E D  T Y R A N N O S A U R U S*
Heidi,Congrats to Heidi. KCMO represent!
Heidi,"YESSSSS MY BOY CHRISSSSSSS

he is the most talented on the show right now by farrrrrrrr"
Heidi,Two super solid talents.
Heidi,Guessing they looked at which skits were most watched on YouTube and did based off that. I don't watch SNL live. I watch it on YouTube and figured both were regular cast since I saw them in so many videos
Heidi,We need some Sarah Beattie in the show.
Heidi,I saw Chris Redd at the Green Room in Chicago once. Hilarious dude.
Heidi,Just a way to keep money from them.
Heidi,He was great in Blackkklansman.
Heidi,He was great in BlacKkKlansman.
Heidi,Wish he would bring back his Dank (& Dabby) character on SNL.
Heidi,SNL making good moves. Congrats to both of them!
Heidi,Chris Redd's credit is good with me for the Fresh Prince sketch alone.
Project Mc²,I could see David Spade.
Project Mc²,Do we really need to grind everything into the ground like this? This doesn't need to be a movie.
Project Mc²,Lt. Dangle
Project Mc²,When my roommate first turned it on I thought it was really weird that Michael Keaton was doing mocumentary...so imma go with Michael Keaton.
Project Mc²,"Jimmi Simpson for Joe Exotic   

Tim Robbins for Doc Antle    

Wendy McLendon-Covey for Carole Baskin"
Project Mc²,I think Michael Keaton would be a good Joe Exotic. You put some crazy ass hair on Keaton and he'll look just like Joe Exotic.
Project Mc²,Obviously Kate McKinnon should play him.
Project Mc²,Danny McBride is the only option for Joe...
Project Mc²,Thomas Lennon
Project Mc²,"My vote goes for John Hawkes. 

He has the build. He just needs the haircut."
Project Mc²,Those are two wildly different suggestions.
Project Mc²,"That seems like a good pick, her beiber is awesome"
Project Mc²,"Joe Dirt FTW.

The [Trailer](https://youtu.be/FpHIIE9Lois) footage can even be used for promos."
Project Mc²,"Oh good, let’s needlessly make it into a movie wherein we’ll have to hire tigers that are exploited by other horrible garbage people.

I loved the series but why does an in-depth, complex 7-part documentary need to be distilled into a two-hour movie?"
Project Mc²,"Nicolas Cage as Joe Exotic, Michael Shannon as Doc Antle, Billy Bob Thornton as Jeff Lowe, and Michael Rooker as Allen Glover."
Project Mc²,"This guy tortured animals and treated people like dirt. 

Why is he being lauded so much?"
Project Mc²,"I want so bad, for either of those actors to play Joe"
Project Mc²,My choice would be Jason Sudeikis.
Project Mc²,Oh boy we're getting a Hollywood production of [Whiskers R We](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzcSJ1setd0)!
Project Mc²,I think they are too old. I think Sam Rockwell might pull it off. He is only 51.
Project Mc²,I think Kate McKinnon as Joe Exotic would be way more entertaining than those guys.
Project Mc²,"I think Sam Rockwell would do an amazing job! He’s so versatile, has great comedic timing, and has already proven he can do a southern accent."
Project Mc²,Andy Dick
Project Mc²,This is like a high school student applying to Harvard and going with a 2 year trade school as his safety school.
Project Mc²,"Why do people care what this piece of shit says? 

This guy abused endangered animals and tried to have an enemy murdered. Quit giving him attention and let him rot in prison for the rest of his pathetic life"
Project Mc²,"Brad Pitt or David Spade, six of one..."
Project Mc²,Brad Pitt could pull it off if he lost some weight.  Let the Coens direct.  I think we should wait until Carol gets busted though as that may be in the pipeline.
Project Mc²,I like he recognizes and casts one Actor for Drama and one Actor for Comedy
Project Mc²,lol this dude was definitely inspired by joe dirt
Project Mc²,What about Daniel Craig!!??
Project Mc²,Why do we need a movie? We just saw the documentary lol
Project Mc²,"OK, I get Brad Pitt but why David Spade?"
Project Mc²,It's an unorthodox choice but I trust Kate.
Project Mc²,Jack Black as Doc Antle.
Project Mc²,James Franco would be my top choice. He's wild enough that I think he'd slide right into that character.
Project Mc²,Honestly Kate McKinnon as Joe Exotic sounds like solid casting.
Project Mc²,Danny McBride. Not debatable
Project Mc²,Definitely give it to McKinnon.
Project Mc²,"When I wasn't thinking of how much of a slimeball Doc Antle, I was thinking of how he was the spitting image of Tim Robbins."
Project Mc²,How do you go from Brad Pitt to David spade?
Project Mc²,"Joe Exotic: Billy Bob Thorton

John Finley husband#1: Brad Pitt/ Channing Tatum

Travis Maldanodo, husband #2: Pete Davidson

Carol Baskin: Angelina Jolie/Sally Struthers
Carol Baskin's husband: Dad from Alf

Doc Antle: Val Kilmer

Jeff Lowe: Ray Liotta
Rick Kirkham director: Steve Buscemi 

Tiger: Al Pacino

Hitman: Jon Voight

Fat guy fbi informant: Mike Myers

Seff: Michelle Rodriguez 

Legless guy: Tommy Lee Jones
Head zookeeper with stuffed tiger: Iggy Pop"
Project Mc²,"Tyler Durder or Joe Dirt

Tough choice"
Project Mc²,Michael Rapaport should play Jeff Lowe... Oh wait nevermind Michael Rapaport is 6'2
Project Mc²,If ya'll could kindly stop giving this this animal abusing piece of shit the attention he's always been seeking that would be great.
Project Mc²,"David Spade, and Hillary Clinton...."
Project Mc²,I don't really see the appeal of a comedy that involves animal abuse to the extent this story does.  I would only support it if a vast portion of the profits went to helping captive big cats (and other animals) in this country.
Project Mc²,The problem is that he has already done Joe Dirt and it is too close.  If you cast him it is just Joe Dirt 3.
Project Mc²,He looks like Michael Keaton tbh
Project Mc²,"Totally agree. Plus the martyring of Exotic Joe has become totally confounding, the guy was a complete piece of garbage who horribly abused animals for many years. Sure there are other people on the show who seem bad too, but that doesnt mean we need to make Joe out to be some wrongly accused good guy."
Project Mc²,Agreed 100% this is so stupid.
Project Mc²,I would love if it were a mockumentary.
Project Mc²,Also no need to make this guy into some kind of cult hero. He is a scumbag and an animal abuser.
Project Mc²,"Yup, it doesn't need to be a movie. 2 hours will only just be the tip of the iceberg, it won't be able to cover all the bat shit crazy things going on. IT NEEDS TO BE A TV SERIES!"
Project Mc²,"I really enjoyed the series and love a lot of the memes out there. It's an obvious PR campaign from Netflix though. A lot of the attention on social media that looks organic isn't.

I know this isn't new in 2020 but it's super obvious with Tiger King."
Project Mc²,Something like Bernie (Jackblack) would be great.
Project Mc²,"While it's fun to think about casting a movie.... (guilty as charged)
I agree that we shouldn't be celebrating terrible people. There's a reason why Joe didn't have a single friend at his trial. He might even be worse than the documentary shows him to be. Lots of footage burned, I'm just sayin."
Project Mc²,If it's well done and entertaining I couldn't care less
Project Mc²,"This is one of those things they announce that never gets made, dont worry"
Project Mc²,Good thing you have a choice to watch it if you want. You wont be forced.
Project Mc²,Disagree...it 200% needs to be a movie
Project Mc²,Joe exotic is the only one that disagrees
Project Mc²,A woman/man of culture I see. Only if he keeps the short shorts
Project Mc²,Me too! I thought it was like an American Vandal thing so I had to look the IMDB so see if that was him.
Project Mc²,It's a shame Philip Seymour Hoffman isn't around to play Baghavan.
Project Mc²,That Carole Baskin casting is bloody fucking perfect mate!
Project Mc²,"I can see that, I can just hear her voice saying hey all you cool cats and kittens"
Project Mc²,Fat Timothy Olyphant for Antle
Project Mc²,I was thinking helena botham carter for Carol
Project Mc²,"I read someone saying that Joe Exotic is who Beetlejuice was when he was alive, and found that so apt...so it could work"
Project Mc²,He'd have to do a convincing accent too
Project Mc²,"I don't actually think he'd be a good Joe Exotic at all. Joe is a Dale Gribble type of character. He's very loud and over the top, but he's very vulnerable at the same time. Joe Exotic needs a softer touch, imo."
Project Mc²,Danny McBride should be the strip club guy.
Project Mc²,yep he would be perfect
Project Mc²,"He’s considerably larger than Joe, though."
Project Mc²,Do they sell padlock cock rings in bulk?
Project Mc²,"Lol same thing I thought. Those are very, very different people. Lena Dunham or Emily Ratajkowski should play That Bitch Carol Baskin."
Project Mc²,If you watched the documentary you would know that Joe exotic likes to give people in need a chance.
Project Mc²,They will gloss over it the same way the documentary did.
Project Mc²,"Perfect, make it 

Joe Dirt 3: Tiger King"
Project Mc²,">Joe Dirt 3

They made a 2nd one? And i thought things were dirty last time, but this time it’s filthy"
Project Mc²,"I disagrees- if Jack Nicholas can successfully play so many shades of the same character (himself, lol) than David Spade can do Joe Exotic!

That said...I sorely, sorely hope this is a comedy. If they are actually trying to make a drama or something serious....I just can't."
Project Mc²,Joe dirt 2 was a disaster.
Project Mc²,There was a 2nd one????
Project Mc²,That's a good shout.
Project Mc²,The movie was already planned way before the documentary dropped.
Project Mc²,"Reunite Brad Pitt and the Coen's and keep it in the comedy style of Burn After Reading and I think it could be great.

Also bring in JK Simmons from there to play Doc Antle."
Project Mc²,"Maybe ""Documentary Now!"" will take it on?"
Project Mc²,I’d be satisfied with more JE music vids
Project Mc²,How are you going to get more of a mockumentary than the real thing?
Project Mc²,"It was with Bird Box too, but people still bought into it."
Project Mc²,theres legit a tiger king fb group with thousands of people posting their oc memes. this show is genuinely popular
Project Mc²,You could? Or couldn't?
Project Mc²,I'm not.
Project Mc²,Gee really?
Project Mc²,"Yeah, he'd have been great!"
Project Mc²,Man that makes me sad I wish I never read this because it's too perfect
Project Mc²,Yes! I could see cast of Reno 911 doing the movie.  Lt. Dangle as Joe Exotic
Project Mc²,Michael Keaton for sure
Project Mc²,That could work! I was think Will Sasso or Z Galifianakis
Project Mc²,Bring back the Panty Dropper!
Club de Cuervos,Yess! Love the show. Cant wait
Club de Cuervos,Yay!
Club de Cuervos,Do you speak Spanish? I'm a native Spanish speaker and a fair amount seems to get lost in translation with the English subs.
Club de Cuervos,I don’t. My native language isn’t even a latin based derivative. I find the show hilarious nonetheless. Partly because the comedy is very physical at points. And partly because it’s about football. I am sure i loose a lot of the tonal comedy as you said.
Club de Cuervos,"Also as a native speaker, can I ask when Chava goes: “Heeenh!” sometimes, is that a regular expression in the spanish/mexican diaspora? Because that expression with that tone is very common for my native language, Bengali. "
Club de Cuervos,"Have you seen The Ballad of Hugo Sanchez? It seems to lose a bit more, but it is hilarious.  I actually watched that one before Club de Cuervos."
Club de Cuervos,Not that I  know of -  I think it is just a Chava thing. I lived in Mexico for 6 yrs and grew up in El Paso - I think it just one of his idiosyncrasies. 
Club de Cuervos,I see. The expression and the tone is so similar to the Bengali “Heeenh!” that my wife and I found it incredibly amusing to the point we use “Heeenh! Hugo Sanchez” when we want to use the phrase.
Club de Cuervos,"Haha, that's cute!
If you haven't seen it yet, watch The Ballad of Hugo Sanchez! Hugo's life is ridiculous!"
Club de Cuervos,"I have! Loved it. Have to check out I, Potro"
Club de Cuervos,Also funny!
Club de Cuervos,Was looking to something to learn some spanish on. I applaud you for bringing this to my attention
Club de Cuervos,I noticed about a month or two ago they had a ton of Spanish speaking shows and movies show up. About a year ago it was the same thing with Bollywood products.
Club de Cuervos,Starting watching not long ago. Love it!
Club de Cuervos,[deleted]
Club de Cuervos,Yep. Three episodes so far. It has its moments.
Club de Cuervos,"And all of them white Latin Americans. Just what I expected. They also had terrible Mexican accents. 

Interesting concept though, so I might still check it out. 

EDIT: I noticed that they named the personal assistant Hugo Sanchez. Subtle dig at Hugo Sanchez, the soccer star?"
Club de Cuervos,[deleted]
Club de Cuervos,No respect if you don't watch El Principe
Club de Cuervos,Gran Hotel and El Internado are also available.  Gran Hotel is like Spanish Downton Abbey.  El Internado is a teen series inspired by Lost.
Club de Cuervos,"Yeah, Netflix has been expanding its Spanish media, particularly from Spain."
Club de Cuervos,But this is the first Netflix production made in Spanish.
Club de Cuervos,Psh. Feels far less cheap than a Canadian sci-fi show.
Club de Cuervos,"How can they have terrible Mex accents when most of the actors are Mexican? 

Don't be nitpicky just for the sake of it"
Club de Cuervos,"Ajjajaja, what da fyck? Terrible mexican accents? And a lot of mexicans ARE white, just saying..."
Club de Cuervos,What? The whole series is available. Where did you get that info? 
Club de Cuervos,"> I will wait till the entire series is available for a weekend binge

[looks at post in confusion... goes back to watching episode 3.]"
Club de Cuervos,i check it and do review afterwards
Club de Cuervos,thanks for recommendation really appreciate this
Club de Cuervos,This will also be the shows final season. I'm going to miss it after it's gone. No other show has make me love to hate their characters as much as this one
Club de Cuervos,Yes!
Club de Cuervos,I finished watching Saturday. It's a good one. Had me hooked. I really connected with Isabel this season and will totally miss Hugo Sanchez.  
Club de Cuervos,¡Si! 
Club de Cuervos,oh holy crap i forgot!
Club de Cuervos,Can anyone share English subtitles for season 4?
Club de Cuervos,"If you haven't yet, check out The Ballad of Hugo Sanchez! I love Hugo. He is such a weird guy and his life is insane,  lol."
Club de Cuervos,⚽️!
Club de Cuervos,"I'm on ep11, and I'm very much liking,  so far. I  wasn't crazy about ep1, but I'm loving the rest of S4. So many ridiculous new jokes!

Zombie 💔"
Club de Cuervos,If only you had a Hugo to remind you of things and keep you on schedule!
Club de Cuervos,Netflix 
Club de Cuervos,"I did watched it! Hugo is by far my favorite character in the show. As a matter of fact, I remember telling my brother, as we were binge watching the first season over a weekend: ""Bro, every single character in this show fucking sucks, I hate them... Except Hugo Sánchez. Hugo Sánchez Is the shit!!"""
Club de Cuervos,"I actually watched Ballad of Hugo Sanchez first. He lives in fucking retirement home - he is crazy! I actually really like Zombie, too. 

I'm on e4s4 and I think those that haven't seen it are missing a wee bit of back story to this season. "
Club de Cuervos,Club De Cuervos is a comedy gem.
Club de Cuervos,Did you watch in Spanish or subbed?
Club de Cuervos,"I watched it, I like it. Some of the dialog is a bit weird but overall not too bad. "
Club de Cuervos,"Oh, I'm Mexican, and I was really esceptic of Club de Cuervos, and the first episode is horrible, the FX are horrible, Luis Gerardo Méndez is the same than in Nosotros Los Nobles, but, then, before the third episode it gets SO much better. There is when you notice is a different story than Nosotros Los Nobles, so, I really enjoy it, I just finish the season and I really want another one."
Club de Cuervos,I thought season 1 was actually pretty good. Glad to hear it was renewed.
Club de Cuervos,That was a great show. Can't wait for the sequel
Club de Cuervos,[deleted]
Club de Cuervos,"Many/most of them are worth watching. But not every viewer will enjoy every bit of content they churn out. For instance, The Get Down and Hip Hop Evolution was something I was super psyched about. Would someone that is not into hip hop enjoy those? Probably not!"
Club de Cuervos,"Most shows labelled 'Netflix Originals' aren't really originally produced by Netflix. Netflix only holds the US/International distribution rights to the project and thus labels it a 'Netflix Original'.

Shows like *Daredevil*, *House of Cards*, *Luke Cage*, etc. are created by Netflix and are true Netflix Originals. 

Most others they just paid to be the sole distributor and are branded Original. This includes Stand up specials, Documentaries, reality shows, foreign speaking shows.

From the ones you listed:

Club de Cuervos,"The thing to note is that for some people, Netflix is the only thing they use to watch TV. Like any old TV channel, they can't just have a couple of shows and that's about it. They've got to have a wide variety of content, otherwise they'll alienate a large percentage of their audience. 

I wouldn't say they have too much, so much as they have a large variety of programs on. "
Club de Cuervos,"You do realize that stuff like 3% and Club de Cuervos is not necessarily meant for you?

Netflix is a global company, they are not making stuff just for americans."
Club de Cuervos,"Club de Cuervos is a funny show (only watched season 1 so far), but it's about owning a soccer club, probably won't have the same pull for people who don't care about soccer just like a show about American football probably won't be of interest to someone in South America.  I'd still give it a try since it's not really about Soccer but about a stupid man inheriting ownership of a professional sports team."
Club de Cuervos,"Everyone here is talking about a show they liked but another that they didn't like, and the vast majority of the titles mentioned are different in every post. So yeah, they're producing a lot and it's not all meant for a single viewer, but overall they're making quality content. Each show has some audience. None will likely have 100% viewership, but they're targeting their viewers well and making sure they're all served in some way by at least 1 thing they produce."
Club de Cuervos,"You're asking Reddit. The answer is no, and they're all worth watching, of course."
Club de Cuervos,I actually find it really interesting how low key their advertising for shows is. ie Stranger Things. I heard nothing about this until someone posted on here that it was a really cool show and then it just exploded. 
Club de Cuervos,"They're definitely not putting out too much, that is the perspective of someone who thinks Netflix expects you to watch everything they put out. TV watching these days is very niche, there are so many shows out there and most of them live on niche followings. Netflix is catering to this by putting out a ton of different things. You aren't meant to like all of them, you're meant to have a wide array of choices giving you a good chance to find something that's in your wheelhouse."
Club de Cuervos,Chewing Gun is really funny. It's a mix of the inbetweeners and girls.
Club de Cuervos,"I haven't watched the majority of their original shows but so far I've enjoyed Bojack Horseman, House of Cards, F Is For Family, Stranger Things and Bloodline. I tried Marco Polo and 3% and never got into them. But they definitely do have original shows worth watching"
Club de Cuervos,"Sometimes it's overwhelming. I really cant keep up with all the shows even though they could be binged in a week.

I am finishing up the Marvel series while starting The OA and need to put Narcos S2 aside for a bit. Haven't even watched one episode of Black Mirror, so that's next. Then there's A Series of Unfortunate Events in Jan that is a must watch for me!

Is it overdoing it? No... because there's a genre for everyone. I tried The Crown and HoC... a bit too slow. You can pick and choose which series to follow and luckily the originals should be on the permanent inventory so I'll pick it up whenever. 

Speaking of HBO, it definitely has been taken to the back burner. I've tried 3x to start The Wire. I know it's good... it's legendary in the sub, but I get amped for new content from Netflix all the time."
Club de Cuervos,I really like the Medici: Masters of Florence. It's very interesting if you like shows like the Borgias and Game of Thrones
Club de Cuervos,"I mean when you churn out 60 shows in a year, theres bound to be several duds. They are still above average compared to most networks. The difference is that Netflix isnt really canceling their bad shows (besides Marco Polo) like othee networks, so theres some selection bias."
Club de Cuervos,"I wish Netflix would make a distinction between ""Netflix originals"" (shows they bought the rights to from other networks) and ACTUAL Netflix originals (House of Cards, Orange is the new Black, etc) on the app."
Club de Cuervos,"Yeah, I feel like they're going a little nuts. Most of them are actually quite good too, but the sheer quantity of them makes me mentally perceive them as being possibly lower in quality, and also possibly being an indicator that they're neglecting their non-original content. Even if neither of those things is actually true, that's the perception it creates (to me)."
Club de Cuervos,"Yeah, I wish Netflix would learn the difference between Netflix Original and Netflix Presents.  The latter is more appropriate when the content originally aired somewhere else, even in another region."
Club de Cuervos,[deleted]
Club de Cuervos,"I admit it's overwhelming, but started Glitch last night and really loved it."
Club de Cuervos,"I don't think OP's point was that there are too many shows, and that sheer ammount was just egregious. I think it was more about being able to successfully advertise/hype/give room to a show? 

OP if you're still lurking, please clarify, because I tend to agree with the latter. "
Club de Cuervos,"I think a key part of innovation is trying out lots of different things and accepting that many of them will fail, so from that perspective I don't see the quantity itself as an issue.

For me, Netflix has had quite a few hits in the last year or two. Most of the ones in this batch are somewhat outside my domain of interest, though, and I've only seen Spectral so far. It was entertaining with a cool premise, I would say not bad but not great either; a somewhat generic sci-fi military shooter with the tropes you'd expect. I watched it mainly because I'm a fan of Stalker and Orpheus."
Club de Cuervos,Club de Cuervos is great. 
Club de Cuervos,Grace and Frankie
Club de Cuervos,3% is awesome
Club de Cuervos,Some of these shows are purchased and just labeled exclusives here in the US.  These shows might run on tv in another territory. 
Club de Cuervos,"I'm a bit disappointed. To me the appeal of Netflix was the long tail. Now they're just turning into an HBO clone.

Every month I see an announcement of something leaving Netflix that I didn't even know was there due to their shitty channel organization/promotion. I'd have enjoyed the hell out of watching old Columbo movies. Instead it kept trying to get me to watch OitNB and rewatch(What the hell?) Stranger Things."
Club de Cuervos,"The bad part for me is there are so few of them I'm interested in.   Sorry, stand-up comedy and history documentaries do nothing for me *shrugs*
"
Club de Cuervos,"If they'd put some fucking money into them I wouldn't mind but they're very clearly cutting as many corners as possible with their budgets.


""So who what superheroes should we make our shows about?""


""Hmmmmmmm, lets do Punchy man, Punchy Woman, Punchy Black Man, Punchy Asian-Themed Man and Gun Man to start out with."""
Club de Cuervos,I didn't like Jessica Jones as much as Luke Cage or Daredevil.  I am suspecting that deep down I am either gay or the kind of sexist who chooses Donald Trump over Hillary Clinton.  I am hoping that I am gay.
Club de Cuervos,I think this is the best explanation of why there is such a high quantity of Netflix originals. Their user base is massive and diverse. They're currently doing the best job of putting out quality shows for every demographic. 
Club de Cuervos,"> A show like Hater's Back Off has never been pushed to me

awww, it's great. I feel like any lover of internet culture would like it."
Club de Cuervos,i don't really like hip hop and I thought it was a lot of fun.
Club de Cuervos,"Can confirm. I tried watching The Get Down. I can recognize that it's a very high quality show. Acting, writing, cinematography, music, everything fit right. It just wasn't my thing.

It's like almost everyone complaining about The OA at the moment. Granted, I've just finished episode 5, but I'm still enjoying it."
Club de Cuervos,that's because you're a television addict! get help!
Club de Cuervos,Medici was produced by Bright Light Productions and aired on Rai 1 in Italy
Club de Cuervos,"Likewise, in the UK we get THE EXPANSE even though it's a Syfy show. It's still slapped with a 'Netflix Original' title. "
Club de Cuervos,"> Shows like Daredevil, House of Cards, Luke Cage, etc. are created by Netflix and are true Netflix Originals. 

None of those examples were created by Netflix either; the Marvel shows are produced by ABC Studios, House of Cards is produced by Media Rights Capital. So far there are only a few shows (such as The Ranch) that Netflix has actually produced and they're quire recent, though Netflix is looking to increase in-house production going forward."
Club de Cuervos,"Is there a list of *true* Netflix originals? And where does something like Arrested Developmenr fall, which was created by another network but is not actually produce and created by Netflix?"
Club de Cuervos,You are really mischaracterizing this.  Some shows netflix brands as originals they just bought the rights to but that isn't the case for all the shows you listed.   Having a separate production company doesn't mean the show isn't an original.  It is a pretty standard setup that also exists in regular television.  No one is going to say Breaking Bad wasn't an AMC original or that Seinfeld wasn't an NBC original.   Doesn't make sense to start doing it for Netflix shows. 
Club de Cuervos,"Really glad you pointed this out. I've often thought this was the case. As a result, the productions that ARE actually original (Daredevil, HOuse of Cards, etc) are usually predictably better than many of the sub-par shows they are branding Netflix, but have actually ""rescued"" from oblivion. Yea - way too much ""original"" content."
Club de Cuervos,Thought 3% is more familiar in the sense that it's mystery type fun show so it will attract more viewers. Club de Cuervos doesn't look like something Americans would watch.
Club de Cuervos,"My cousin told me to watch it a year ago but I brushed it off initially. They're visiting from Mexico and we were watching it one day and I binged the first season in a week. I don't watch Spanish TV and I'm not really into soccer ( I will watch it occasionally, but don't follow it) but I was surprised how much I was invested into the show. I'm fluent in Spanish so I understand it all, but I wonder how well the humour would translate into English with subtitles. 

I recommended it to my brother, but it's hard to recommend it to friends that don't speak Spanish because I'm not sure if they'd like it. 

It's a great show and the 2nd Season just came out but I hope it gets renewed for another season, because I would love to see more of these characters. 

"
Club de Cuervos,"> I actually find it really interesting how low key their advertising for shows is. ie Stranger Things. 

there was nothing low key about that, they advertised it all the time on regular tv channels, even billboards up in my city. I think i even saw a trailer/ad for it in the cinema around the time it came out.

they pushed hard on the advertising for that show and it was money well spent."
Club de Cuervos,They pretty much just drop the trailer and move on. They sometimes pay for commercials too.
Club de Cuervos,Nice to see Walder Frey finally got Robb to marry his daughter 
Club de Cuervos,Ahhh fuuuck I would certainly like to see more rob
Club de Cuervos,"For me the hard part is figuring out which shows are worth watching. There's a couple shows that I can't find any reviews on at all. For example, I've heard some people love The OA and other people who hate it. And since my time is really limited I don't like investing in a show unless I know it's going to be good. "
Club de Cuervos,Why?
Club de Cuervos,"Yeah, it's like that thing in cognitive psychology where the more choices you have, the less satisfied you'll be with the one you pick. Sure, this one show might be nice, but I'm always going to be wondering if I should be watching one of the other 29 shows. It doesn't help that Netflix doesn't keep a convenient list anywhere - every time I click the home page I'm bombarded with 7 new original shows and it's actually pretty hard to keep track.

HBO only has a handful of really outstanding shows (Deadwood, Rome, Sopranos, Carnivale, The Wire) so I don't feel too bad picking one to binge watch. "
Club de Cuervos,This as well. It was really strange to see Glitter Force (Saban's attempt to dub Pretty Cure) advertised as a Netflix Original.
Club de Cuervos,"> Stranger Things (it's not that great though

this show has gotten so much hype. I just finished watching it and it's not perfect but I think it does the 80s so damn well it gets a lot of hype. but seriously I love how no one made a big deal about barbara going missing and not being found."
Odd Squad,"She served as an executive for Nickelodeon and Cartoon Network both, and both runs were during some of their best years. I have high faith in her selecting quality projects for kids."
Odd Squad,"Man...I'm not saying it's a bad show but the wild kratts drive me up the fucking wall. They have access to multiple pieces of completely ground-breaking technology and make the DUMBEST GODDAMN DECISIONS with it. Like they were studying ~~grizzly~~  black bears and ~~one of them activates into a bear to get into a salmon-fishing competition with a real bear~~, they track two bears catching fish to see who gets more, and one of the brothers gets into a salmon-sized boat that looks JUST LIKE a fucking salmon and SWIMS INTO THE EXACT AREA WHERE REAL FUCKING BEARS ARE TRYING TO CATCH SALMON and QUELLE FUCKING SURPRISE, a bear catches this fucking miracle of technology and tries to EAT IT.

Sorry. I've been carrying that around for a while.

Edit: mis-remembered a few details. The point still stands."
Odd Squad,Odd Squad is awesome.
Odd Squad,Dinosaur Train sounds like a badass metal band
Odd Squad,Grownnnnnn ups come back.
Odd Squad,My 2 year old loves Daniel Tigers Neighborhood.... and I love getting the little reminders of Mr Rogers. So she’s a-ok in my book and I’m happy for her success.
Odd Squad,Odd Squad FTW
Odd Squad,"Dinosaur Train is pretty fun for my oldest, but I really like Wild Kratts and love Odd Squad. I just turned 36."
Odd Squad,"If she's also responsible for Pinkalicious, my 3 year old may have single handedly secured the promotion for her."
Odd Squad,"I had some friends shit on Daniel Tiger as ""it wasn't made by the Roger's estate"" a few years ago. So I assumed it was shit.

Flash forward to me having toddler and I am realizing it's the best show on TV to teach kids how to be a decent human being. (t also makes me realize the kind of behaviors I need to exhibit as a parent, too)

Just because a piece of media is made outside the legacy of a prominent figure doesn't mean it can't be amazing."
Odd Squad,"My 3 year old loves all of those shows.

&#x200B;

I approve."
Odd Squad,"Daniel Tiger is great. Wholesome, with lots of teaching moments for both kids and adults."
Odd Squad,All my favorite shows
Odd Squad,"Odd Squad is great, and Wild Kratts is good enough.  My kid likes them both, but even I, as an adult, somewhat enjoy OddSquad."
Odd Squad,Odd Squad rules.
Odd Squad,Good! She’s great! And give PBS funding too!
Odd Squad,"PBS Kids is the only subscription service my family pays for. My boys enjoy all these shows. Actually, my wife and I do too.
 
Based on the shows listed and Linda’s overall track record, I’m looking forward to what’s coming next. It should be great."
Odd Squad,Who made Paw Patrol? ...'cuz they need to be exorcised and sealed in a floating tomb of holy water
Odd Squad,/r/danieltigerconspiracy
Odd Squad,Good! We need moar Dinosaur Train things! My youngest who isn’t even born yet will give me an excuse to watch it again.
Odd Squad,Molly of Denali is my jam
Odd Squad,She knows what to do
Odd Squad,I miss just old school Mr. Rogers
Odd Squad,We did most of these with our son. I hope for all the best things for her:)
Odd Squad,"Idk what odd squad is, but the rest are pretty good. Dinosaur Train is something I would want to dislike, but I’d stick up for it if some other show was bullying it."
Odd Squad,My son and I have some good memorable times watching Wild kratts 🤙🏼🤙🏼🤙🏼
Odd Squad,She deserves it! I have a 6 and 5 year old boys and they grew up on those shows! My wife and I ended up liking them as much or more as our boys
Odd Squad,"My kids like most of the above shows, but for me, **Peg + Cat** is where it's at."
Odd Squad,Congratulations Linda!
Odd Squad,"The Kratt bothers are still around? Damn, I didn’t know they were still making shows. I still remember Kratt’s Creatures and Zaboomafoo."
Odd Squad,"Just FYI, PBS Kids is free steaming live on their website. Important bookmark for the living room PC!"
Odd Squad,"Lol, saw the thumbnail and I was like why is Weird Al associated with this?"
Odd Squad,I was hoping that satan Caillou was not on her resume and am greatly relieved
Odd Squad,Those are the four shows that my kids like.
Odd Squad,bring back zoom
Odd Squad,Dinosaur train. Dinosaur train.
Odd Squad,"Basically all the best shows.  I’m not young anymore and I still think they’re all awesome.

....Now the dinosaur train song is stuck in my head.... damnit"
Odd Squad,"Oh no, not Odd Squad."
Odd Squad,"I watch all this shit all morning before getting the kids ready for school, and I love Nature Cat!"
Odd Squad,"I watch dinosaur train after the kids go to sleep, no shame."
Odd Squad,The first time I watched Dinosaur train like 9 years ago I was half asleep half dreaming with a screaming 3 month old in my arms and I thought I was hallucinating. My son and I still sit down to watch the time traveling dinosaurs because it’s something we shared and it’s completely bonkers. And the equally bonkers odd squad is one of the strangest funniest shows I’ve ever seen.
Odd Squad,Of course the promote a woman since in todays world if you promote a man you are sexist and oppressing.
Odd Squad,Hopefully she can bring it back to level of 90s PBS
Odd Squad,"Why doesn't Daniel Tiger wear pants?  Or his dad.  Everyone else seems to wear pants, dresses, or skirts.  Daniel wears PJ pants and snow pants, but most of the time he's out there freeballing it.  Why?  This is a show that deals with serious issues like the potty and dealing with strangers.  Daniel should be wearing pants."
Odd Squad,Wild Kratts depict predators as malicious animals. Total bullshit and misleading.  Daniel Tiger’s Neighborhood is mindless garbage.
Odd Squad,"Look I know I'm biased because I'm an adult and I wasn't raised on any of those shows, but they all pail in comparison to their predecessors. Kids really have to settle for Daniel Tiger and Wild Kratts when we were getting Mr. Rogers and Zoboomafoo? Give them some good shows. Odd Squad is the only thing listed there that didn't make me roll my eyes and that's because I only know it by it's name."
Odd Squad,Daniel Tiger would make a nice rug tbh.
Odd Squad,If both my kids are indicators her track record is phenomenal
Odd Squad,That's a lot more relevant to the new position than shows she's directed. Makes me more confident.
Odd Squad,It makes me miss Zoboomafoo.  But I do love the Kratt Bros so we still watch Wild Kratts.
Odd Squad,"I thought Wild Kratts was live action for a second so I was majorly confused until I looked it up... ohhh


https://youtu.be/Vqj-r83ywUc?t=1170"
Odd Squad,LMAO so mad that the French came out
Odd Squad,See you on the creature trail!
Odd Squad,"I was about to be mad at first, and by th he end I was rolling. I can totally relate"
Odd Squad,"I think we made a lot of good progress today. Wait here please, and we'll schedule your next appointment."
Odd Squad,"If they really want to perform a Creature Rescue, they’d shrink herds of cattle, put them to grange for a month on a half acre, then bring them back to size. No more clear cutting the Amazon."
Odd Squad,"You definitely have kids and have been watching Wild Kratts with them. That one is definitely not my favorite for the reason you stated, so it's usually when I tune out a little and read."
Odd Squad,"Honestly, that sounds hilarious."
Odd Squad,I have similar feelings about Vampirina. That show seemed so cute at first but now its permanently banned in our house because it pisses me off so much.
Odd Squad,The Kratt brothers when they appear on the show in the real look bizarrely different than their young and spry animated counterparts. I feel like they really dropped the ball on more accurately portraying middle aged dudes.
Odd Squad,"How did they react to it, being their fault and all? Maybe the point of it was to teach kids not to get angry at animals for behaving as they obviously would and to act accordingly around them (i.e do not become salmon shaped in front of a bear and then put it down when it attacks you)."
Odd Squad,"This happens all the time on this show. 
My problem, though, is how narcissistic it is. Chris and Martin Kratt create, write and produce a show about themselves. They give the main characters their names and have them always out in the wildest landscape, seeing amazing sites, saving the environment, with the most amazing tech especially built for them. With the people essentially following them about driving them about and inventing things for them.
The way they talk about how they love to see animals fighting each other. Some of this just weirds me out."
Odd Squad,"Odd Squad is one of the weirdest shows I've ever randomly seen. [Like full on Adult Swim level weirdness.](https://youtu.be/XdENWz0zIus)


I guess spoilers for a kids show: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15HHeaULkIk"
Odd Squad,Love me some Odd Squad!
Odd Squad,"that show is fuckin wild man, spy kids meets scp foundation."
Odd Squad,"I love the cop show parody jokes that only adults would get. I love all the weird quirks they bring out of each character, like how Agent Otto eats soup weird.

It's a house favorite."
Odd Squad,"Odd Squad is the goods. Actually, if anyone involved is reading this, there’s a little girl I love named Oswin and she soaks up everything about each episode. Almost five years old and a huge fan.She’s able to follow the math concepts but she’s studying the humor too. 

Anyways, what I’m saying is  “O” names are cool and if she ever heard her name on the show? I think she would run squealing through the house for at least half an hour. Just tossing that wishing coin out into the internet wishing well. (That said, I have no clue when this show was made or if new episodes are even being produced)"
Odd Squad,I’m super impressed by their set designs. Always wondered how they got the budget for it.
Odd Squad,My kids love it...almost as much as my wife and I do. If this was on when I was a kid I’d be downright OBSESSED with the show. As an adult though I’m equally impressed with the performances they get out of the kid actors as I am with the writing/world building/sets/etc. They must pick just the right kids and then have people on set working absolute magic with them.
Odd Squad,"Odd Squad is this generation's MathNet, basically."
Odd Squad,"Odd Squad pisses me off. You notice, all the competent characters have to be attractive. The fat kid is, surprise surprise, an idiot who calls himself Potato. Only attractive girls can lead in the show. The less attractive girls are nerds, dorks, etc. Pretty pathetic stereotyping if you ask me. It's the only PBS Kids show I won't let my kid watch.

Edit: guess I found where all the incels went. Touched a nerve, didn't I?"
Odd Squad,It’s also a metal concept: a train filled with dinosaurs run by velociraptors that travels through time.
Odd Squad,"Dinosaur Train, dinosaur train, Dinosaur Train, dinosaur train
we are going to riiiiiiiiiiide the Dinosaur Train!"
Odd Squad,[Dinosaur Warfare](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hUUaMD2l7Ms)
Odd Squad,"When you have to go potty *STOP!* -- and go riiight awaaay.

We just started potty training our little one and this show has been a major help."
Odd Squad,"When something is new, holding a hand can help you"
Odd Squad,My wife works graveyard at a hospital so I sing this to our 5 y/o almost every night. Some nights are harder then others for her.
Odd Squad,"God-tier public transportation and for some reason Daddy Tiger and Grandpere don’t wear pants, but Mama Tiger does."
Odd Squad,"Can Blue fish play, tomorrow?

No... Blue fish cant play anymore."
Odd Squad,Daniel Tiger's Neighborhood acts like they are teaching kids but they are low-key incepting ideas on how to be a good parent.
Odd Squad,"My two year old demands “the kitty show” daily.   I feel like bad parent letting her veg in front of the tv but it buys me so much time for chores and self-care!  Plus, it’s educational and not horribly annoying to listen to.   

We’ve started teaching daddy the cleanup song and will probably hit others as we go."
Odd Squad,"I was not aware of Daniel Tiger's Neighborhood until my son was born, and so far removed from Mr. Rogers Neighborhood that I didn't even realize what I was watching until the end (I didn't hear the opening theme).

I actually teared up from the flood of childhood memories that came back while I held my infant son. It also comforted me to know that he will have exposure to the same quality material I did, if not better than what I watched back in the 80s/90s."
Odd Squad,"Coming from a masculine household and not being able to properly convey my emotions, DT and my daughter have helped me tremendously"
Odd Squad,My sons a year and a half and loves the show. It’s really good imo.
Odd Squad,Hell yeah...
Odd Squad,Wild Kratts is great. Family favorite here too. PBS kids app could use some help though. I’d pay for content on it.
Odd Squad,"pinkalicious is the female caillou, and i fuckin hate caillou."
Odd Squad,"I'm not sure I'd say it's outside his legacy. I mean would you rather a show be made by the guy's estate or by [his production company](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Rogers_Productions), including many of the people who worked with him?"
Odd Squad,I can only watch so much of it because I miss Mr. Rogers so much somedays
Odd Squad,Disney
Odd Squad,What the fuck did I just walk into
Odd Squad,A way for adults who are forced to watch kids' shows to derive entertainment from it
Odd Squad,"My god, thank you for this. Now I have to dig up the outline for the YA action adventure I almost wrote as a sequel to Jim Henson’s Pajanimals."
Odd Squad,Cheers!
Odd Squad,"I grew up watching Mister Roger's Neighborhood, and I firmly believe that he would be rather disappointed with the spiritual successor to his show. Many who loved his show may remember his prominent display of the yellow traffic light as a reminder to ""slow down."" The frenetic pace of Daniel Tiger sells out on that point completely, electing instead to cater to over-stimulated i-pad children just to stay competitive. I think this show would fall closer to the TV that Fred Rogers ""hated"" when he struck out to do something better.

I low key fucking hate Daniel Tiger"
Odd Squad,Same. My 2 year old loves it and I’m fine with her choice
Odd Squad,You can watch some episodes on the PBS Kids app.
Odd Squad,Odd Squad is like “what if the MIB or SCP Foundation was only run by kids and they learn math and stuff while trying to contain weird aliens in Canada”. It’s legitimately good.
Odd Squad,All of those shows are still on demand via their website. My 3yo enjoys Daniel *and* Mr. Rogers.
Odd Squad,Odd squad has some good jokes even for adults.
SamSam," “It went from satire to the thing it was satirizing.”  

Sounds like a Sam Levinson project."
SamSam,"> “It was a show about a woman who was finding herself sexually, turned into a show about a man who gets to abuse this woman and she loves it.” 

😬"
SamSam,">Casting K-pop superstar Jennie of Blackpink was the biggest get for Levinson. Under the show’s hashtag and teaser trailers, her stans steamrolled comment sections to cheer on the singer in her first acting role. But crew members claim Jennie has barely any air time and an inconsequential story arc. “It was like three or four lines per episode for her,” a production source says. “They didn’t let her talk that much. Her job was to sit there [and] look pretty, basically.” 

Like YG Entertainment would have agreed to anything more. They now have a well-established reputation for overhyping and underdelivering."
SamSam,Sam Levinson seriously needs to jerk off before coming into work.
SamSam,">The first public inkling of trouble came last April, when director Amy Seimetz, of The Girlfriend Experience and She Dies Tomorrow, suddenly exited with roughly 80 percent of the six-episode series finished. HBO addressed the news by confirming The Idol was set to have a major creative overhaul and would be adjusting the cast and crew. There was little explanation for the shakeup, except for reports that Tesfaye, who is co-creator, felt the show was heading too much into a “female perspective.”

&#x200B;

I mean, the protagonist is a woman, how is leading too much into a female perspective is bad?"
SamSam,"I understand that Levinson is a fucking creep, but let’s not forget that The Weeknd is co-creator, co-writer, exec. producer, and apparently put in the request that turned the show on its head. Whatever comes of this, he deserves just as much blame as anyone else, and it’s crazy that most people are kinda glossing over that."
SamSam,It’s insane that Euphoria will coast over 100 million for the next season.
SamSam,"Man, I was mostly interested in this show just for Amy Seimetz. Replacing her killed my interest even before all that shitshow."
SamSam,Every single thing I read about Sam Levinson screams *”I’M THE SON OF A FAMOUS DIRECTOR SO I THINK I CAN DO WHATEVER I WANT!!!!”*
SamSam,I seem to recall that the original director had wanted episodes exploring Lily rose depp’s character’s personal life and relationship with a childhood friend- good reflective stuff that gives the show depth. Anyway The Weeknd vetoed it for being too feminist 💀
SamSam,"> Levinson allegedly stopped sending scripts to HBO and certain department heads, according to two people familiar with the matter. “I got the vibe that the mood on set was, ‘What’s HBO gonna do, pull the plug? Yeah, right. If they want a third season of Euphoria, they’ll give me what I want… We’re just gonna shoot what we want and if [HBO execs] have a problem with it, that’s their problem,’” they explain. 

wouldn't be surprised if Euphoria gets canned after this, the arrogance is astonishing"
SamSam,"*Seimetz seemed set up to fail from the start. When she arrived on set seven weeks before the show started filming, she was given half-finished scripts, a first-time showrunner in Epstein, a tight schedule, and near-impossible expectations from HBO, those sources say. “Amy was doing her best in an impossible situation, but she was going to lose this no matter what,” one production member says. “Honestly, I think HBO handed her a shit stack.” (Seimetz declined to comment.)  HBO had wanted to keep costs low with a series budget around $54 million...Euphoria’s upcoming third season, which is expected to cost at least $110 million.*

So they wanted to do it cheaply, didn't make sure the script was done, drove the director out of the project before it was done, reshot the whole thing writing it in a completely different way...  It's sounds like the developmental execs at HBO are terrified to do their job well given all the projects getting axed by the new overlords."
SamSam,I went from wow that sounds like a mess to work on to wow an egg where and she is begging him for what?!?! I like dark shows and shows that push the envelope but this is not it.
SamSam,I know several people worked on this show and I’ve yet to hear a single person say a good thing about it. Such a fucking mess and it definitely crossed into dangerous territory once Levinson was there.
SamSam,They gave The Weeknd too much power and not surprisingly he went on an ego trip. He has that movie with Jenna Ortega and Barry Keoghan that he's also writing and producing up next which is too bad because we'll probably hear something similar there.
SamSam,"I'm genuinely starting to believe that this show does not and never will actually exist, and that its seemingly neverending promotional rollout/behind-the-scenes soap opera is in itself a work of Andy Kaufmanesque performance art. Certainly I'm no closer to knowing - beyond the bare-bones outline - what the hell the actual story is supposed to be than I was when it was first announced approximately two thousand years ago, so maybe it really is all just an elaborate Situationist prank?

At any rate, I think it's very funny that everyone's wringing their hands about an obviously planted story that paints the show as a dark, dangerous, boundary-smashing orgy of decadence, which just so happens to be the exact image its makers are going for. [This legendary Onion story](https://www.theonion.com/marilyn-manson-now-going-door-to-door-trying-to-shock-p-1819565904) kept springing to mind."
SamSam,All of Sam Levinson’s projects seem like a dumpster fire to work on. His sets are always chaotic and messy and unorganized. And this torture porn thing is not a good look.
SamSam,"""Falling too much into a female perspective [paraphrased]”

On, my dear God, *no*!  Not something that will speak to 51% of the human population!!  The *horror*!

JFC."
SamSam,ok but that egg scene? have you lost your damn mind levinson?
SamSam,"Levinson sounds like a budding Weinstein. Dude's private, sketchy predilections coming out publicly, and all he gets is more money and power. 

When someone shows you who they are, believe them the first time, Hollywood."
SamSam,I'm not going to be surprised at all if some kind of Kevin Spacey/Bryan Singer/Harvey Weinstein type stories come out about Sam Levinson. I am surprised they haven't come out yet.
SamSam,Sam Levinson’s got some issues.
SamSam,"Warning: Rape, Sexual Assault

“At various points, Levinson’s scripts contained disturbing sexual and physically violent scenes between Depp and Tesfaye’s characters, three sources familiar with the matter claim. In one draft episode, there allegedly was a scene where Tesfaye bashes in Depp’s face, and her character smiles and asks to be beaten more, giving Tesfaye an erection. (This scene was never shot, the source says.) Another proposed scenario was for Depp to carry an egg in her vagina and if she dropped or cracked the egg, Tesfaye’s character would refuse to “rape” her — which sent Depp’s character into a spiral, begging him to “rape” her because she believed he was the key to her success. (This scene also was not filmed because production couldn’t find a way to realistically shoot the scene without having Depp physically insert the egg, another source explains.) “

Can someone check Levinson’s and The Weeknd’s hard drive and search history please. I know that these ended up not getting filmed but why were they up for consideration in the first place?"
SamSam,"Even since it was revealed that The Weeknd felt that the show was heading too much into a ""female perspective"" and therefore decided to change that I knew the show would end up being messy."
SamSam,This will either bomb or this will be such a huge hit that talking heads will question if this is the further moral decline and decadence of society.
SamSam,The Weekend is a misogynist? How unsurprising.
SamSam,Wish Harmony Korine was at the helm 😀
SamSam,Well I'm glad I'm not the only person who thinks Euphoria is creepy voyeurism and not the show of a generation anymore
SamSam,"Reading the whole article, it appear that as problematic as Sam's writing is, the issues were apparent long before he took over.

Looking at some of these quotes in bold:

**As promising as those initial scripts were, the scripts for the final episodes were still only half-finished and the finale completely unwritten. Seimetz was encouraged by HBO and producers to put her own spin on the show and write the last episode, a source explains. As a result, Seimetz was polishing up scripts and writing while directing. She also had her assistant, who had no previous credited writing experience, writing scenes, with HBO making the assistant a staff writer last January. (The assistant did not respond to a request for comment.)**

**Organization quickly evaporated, mainly due to changes in the script, sources say. One production member says the first version of the show went through more than 20 rewrites, saying scripts were being updated constantly: “We did it every fucking day. It was insane.** 

**Eventually, the crew say they stopped getting one-liners, an industry term for daily schedules of what was being shot. And the few one-liners that were given out quickly became useless due to changes, sources say. Decisions were being made on the fly, frustrating several crew members who say they felt they could never properly prepare for the next day of work. “I’d be driving home [at the end of the day] and they’d be like, ‘Oh, we’re adding a scene, but it hasn’t been written yet,’” one says.** 

**A report from April blamed the show’s overhaul on Tesfaye, who was reportedly unhappy that the story was focusing too much on Depp’s character, according to Deadline. A source with knowledge seconds that Tesfaye was the reason behind the shakeup, wanting to tone down the cult aspect of the storyline and pivot into something else entirely, dropping the “feminist lens” through which the show was being told as a result. “It was like the Weeknd wanted one show that was all about him — Sam was on board with that,” another source explains to Rolling Stone.**


In a six episode season, if you still have unfinished scripts for the remaining episodes and an unwritten final episode while you are filming an hectic production, it is obvious that the problem are deeper than just one person.


From reading the quotes above, It look like nobody had any actual finished outline of what direction the show was going toward or how it would end since they admitted that they already have gone through 20 rewrites while Seimetz was still in charge of the show. 

When you are rewriting scripts that many times and you still haven't even finished the scripts for the remaining episodes in a six episode season, it will be difficult to have a coherent story and character development. 

The crazy thing is that if this was a 22 episode season, it would make sense to have rewrite or revision to the scripts due to the length of the season but when you are struggling to write up only six episodes with a small timeframe for shooting and production, this is basically an issue from HBO management to the writing team. 

As problematic and disturbing as the reports have been about Sam especially backstage on Euphoria, it appear that just blaming him is the easy way out regarding the issues plaguing this show. 

The article make it clear that the issues were there from the first day of production before he was even involved and that the issues just kept getting worse as shooting continued. 

Also, It look like Tesfaye wanted the show to be more about him and his character compared to Depp's character. When you have one of the two Main Character of the show apparently having an issue with a woman character being the focus, you are going to have a difficult time appeasing him unless you recast him with a new actor who would be fine with allowing a woman to shine.

Honestly, you can just lay the blame on HBO management which appear to have an unrealistic deadline and a refusal to oversee what actually is going on regarding the scripts and production."
SamSam,Kpop fans will make or break this show.
SamSam,[removed]
SamSam,"Slightly off topic but does anyone else share this opinion about The Weeknd:

He sings about all the drugs and sex he does but form the very beginning I was like “nah,  I don’t believe you.”  He’s trying too hard. Like that kid that brags about his hot girlfriend but you don’t know her cause she goes to another school. He’s always giving lil dick energy. Some artists can pull it off, the attitude, the machismo, but not him. He’s a dork to his core. A pretender. 

Solid pop music though. Can’t argue with his phenomenal success!"
SamSam,I mean Euphoria was softcore porn with the appeal of teenagers pretending they invented fucking wasn't it?
SamSam,I always found the critics absolute obsession and love for this show odd. The length to which they show drugs and sex not only feels weird to watch it’s also just not accurate. Then again maybe most of the critics hadn’t experienced high school in some time so they actually thought this was accurate.
SamSam,Honestly I stopped watching euphoria after a season because it just made me feel yucky.
SamSam,"Tbh, you could also make a fine argument about euphoria glamorizing drugs and debauchery, more than actually addressing its problems. Just watch the first few minutes of the very first episode and you'll understand,lol"
SamSam,Same with Euphoria.  It’s porn.   You can tell his intended audience is one that enjoys sec versions of saw.
SamSam,"His Netflix film, Malcom and Marie was utter garbage in my opinion. I enjoyed Euphoria but when I look back on why I enjoyed it nothing comes to mind. I tried rewatching it with my girlfriend and found it to be more annoying than thought provoking or even entertaining."
SamSam,"Justice for Amy Steimetz, an actually talented director with a VIEW and not just sensationalist style over substance.

This could have been so good with her given how terrific The Girlfriend Experience was."
SamSam,[deleted]
SamSam,The joys of Hollywood nepotism. Does Sam even know what real life is like?
SamSam,"Used to date his former nanny. She’s also a total sociopath, and I’m not surprised she found herself in his employ. Hope this is the end of his gross and weird almost-middle-aged-man-cum-teen-sex-fantasizer trip."
SamSam,"You can tell this show is going to be fucking sick, not in a good way. Euphoria works because it’s a more modern day “skins” but with all this stuff coming out about this guy his shows and its intentions are starting to show themselves"
SamSam,"Zendayas story arch aside, Euphoria is just Degrassi with penises."
SamSam,This is pretty obviously some marketing hype disguised as an expose.
SamSam,What an awkward headline
SamSam,This is giving Marlon Brando/Bernando Bertolucci vibes (IYKYK)...
SamSam,"Sam do be into depraved, toxic sexuality."
SamSam,"on the fence about whether this is *intentional* marketing -- but given that this exact article has been posted on Reddit 11 separate times, has almost 1500 comments on this thread alone, Tesfaye had a targeted and ready-made clip to respond to Rolling Stone with, and it subsumed discourse all day yesterday on other social media platforms incl. Twitter, I'm pretty sure it generated exactly the kind of outrage/buzz that will propel the premiere to sky-high viewership. Happy to revisit this comment when the show premieres and eat my words if I'm wrong but I doubt I will be. It's worth noting that the loudest critics of Euphoria have usually watched 16 episodes, maybe even all 18.

I'm pretty disturbed at how comfortable everyone is casually slinging around rumors about Levinson being some kind of predator, though. Not only is there zero evidence of that, but there's not even any *allegations* of him being remotely creepy. There's not even anything to disprove, just people clearly hoping that bad things will come out about him presumably because they dislike his work so much. Levinson certainly doesn't seem to find his own work as titillating as everyone here clearly does -- [seriously, I'd recommend reading this THR interview with him, he comes off as very thoughtful and just...not creepy](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/euphoria-creator-boundary-pushing-hbo-drama-didnt-pull-punches-1218588/) -- and nearly all the social media comments are bursting with inter-generational hysteria about Kids These Days and dismissing Euphoria as porn while clearly ignoring the fact that Euphoria is making a commentary on how the ubiquity of internet porn has affected culture and particularly teenagers. I respect it for at least trying to start a cultural conversation on how porn is affecting youth and sexual expectations/gender dynamics especially when a lot of the takes around porn are just like, ""why don't you just jerk off in the privacy of your own room, you sick freak, and we can all pretend this huge cultural force doesn't exist.""

All this is not to discount the worrying accusations in the article, such as that of a disorganized set -- poor work conditions are no joke -- but all of the other stuff like the description of the egg scene, which wasn't even filmed, is to some extent clearly being enjoyed as salacious and transgressive by those who read it. Rape kinks are real and [not uncommon](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19085605/), another thing that could stand to be critically engaged with instead of acting like it's some collective dirty secret. Maybe the show failed at that but we can't really say until watching, which I'm sure most people will -- but I'm fascinated by how many people will eat up Levinson's work and then will completely miss the commentary or continue to insist he's some pervert. This conflict between what people do/want and what they openly admit to doing and wanting is a running theme throughout his prior work....and if you don't believe me on that then read the THR interview. anyway, ready to get downvoted into oblivion lol"
SamSam,"Why do people keep hiring Lily-Rose Depp?

How much is this costing her dad in influence and cash?"
SamSam,Gonna be funny watching everyone slowly realize Sam Levinson is a total hack…
SamSam,Idk something tells me we will one day be talking about Sam Levinson the way we talk about J*ss Wh*d*n
SamSam,"This: 
>	Tesfaye, who is co-creator, felt the show was heading too much into a “female perspective.”

Plus this:
>	It was like any rape fantasy that any toxic man would have in the show — and then the woman comes back for more because it makes her music better,”

Is super disconcerting."
SamSam,"I’m not a huge Euphoria fan, and I tend to agree that Zendaya’s arc is definitely the best (and maybe the only good) storyline, but I’m always a bit confused by Reddit’s disgust for the show. 

It’s definitely not a super realistic depiction of high school and it’s way over dramatized, but people do drugs and have sex in high school. I went to a tiny school and even there we had heroin addicts, meth addicts, etc. People had sex at parties. It was certainly way more awkward and not as glamorous as it is on Euphoria, but Euphoria is purposefully melodramatic.

The nudity can be too much, but all of the actors are in their mid-twenties. I don’t really agree that it’s pedophilic of the creator to depict high school sex.  All of Harmony Korine’s early movies had  more fucked up stuff involving kids and teens than Euphoria does."
SamSam,Dude is a scumbag. Plain and simple.
SamSam,Read the stuff that got cut and I think I'm going to skip this one.
SamSam,">There was little explanation for the shakeup, except for reports that Tesfaye, who is co-creator, felt the show was heading too much into a “female perspective.”

Oh boy."
SamSam,"Its funny, I work in TV maeketing. Was watching a few trailers of The Idol today for work and said to my co workers “this is just softcore porn”."
SamSam,"I'm so fucking done with overly sexual shows and movies. I just want a good show/movie without having to see extremely graphic sex scenes for way too long or straight up pansexual orgies.

I want to be captivated, not shocked. It has nothing to do with my beliefs (atheist) and I'm not sexually frustrated, I just hate it because of how unnecessary it is. If I wanted to watch porn, the internet's full of it already. It's not art, it's just showing everyone you're a fucking pervert."
SamSam,Sam Levinson is gonna be one of those guys you find out in twenty years was doing some mad creepy shit behind the scenes
SamSam,Euphoria sucked so I’m sure this will too.  At least it looks like the characters are supposed to be adults at least.
SamSam,"The Weeknd deserves as much blame as Levinson imo, dude was a co-producer. Even some of his earlier music references taking advantage of young models, etc. Fucking creeps."
SamSam,More high school teens fuckin... I mean that's HBO's bread and butter
SamSam,I just know Sydney Sweeney is going to expose Sam once *Euphoria* is done. Expecting the upcoming season to be its last tbh.👀
SamSam,"“The Idol, which is being billed as a **darker, crazier, and more risqué** version of Levinson’s smash-hit Euphoria.”

Wait, WHAT?"
SamSam,"It's not porn, it's HBO.

https://youtu.be/pBhLI3NqnaQ"
SamSam,Sam Levinson sounds like one of those guys in Hollywood who is going to become a major flash in the pan and done with.
SamSam,"Never seen Euphoria, is it good?"
SamSam,Wasn’t interested in seeing it but now they’ve got at least 2 guaranteed episodes out of me.
SamSam,"I bet zaslav loves that shit, it combines the unscripted trash he became famous for with the high budget and audience HBO brings"
SamSam,"Every single reasonable Euphoria fan: ""Yeah, I could see Sam Levinson doing that"""
SamSam,"Nepo Depp ""best director ever worked for""...in her long and storied career phhht"
SamSam,"Who want's to start a pool and bet on when Sam Levinson is going to get his first accusation of sexual misconduct? Maybe he hasn't yet, and he legit thinks he's just an artist, but people lie to themselves all the time and often times the harder they try and cover shit up, the more it pokes through. Either way, I'm leaving this here so I can link back to it when it becomes clear I was right."
SamSam,It does suck if hbo enocouraged seimetz to do her own take and bailed on her...But overall I dunno...its the weeknd's show basically.If he wants it changed I guess I don't see the problem.The main creative leads are him and levinson I think(?).
SamSam,"I'd never heard of this show until just now. It sounds terrible and expensive. 


HBO is about to lose their asses on this train wreck if it ever actually comes out, I'm getting some 12 Miles of Bad Road vibes from this article."
SamSam,Oh man is Hollywood a bad place
SamSam,"Interesting marketing plan, HBO..."
SamSam,"Mark my words, this man's career will be hit with a sex crime scandal, most likely from him being a predator."
SamSam,"That was a fucking trip to read, yikes, I loved Euphoria’s first season and haven’t watched the second yet, but this dude seems like trouble"
SamSam,Nice try but I’m still not watching a show starring those fools. You could tell me they literally get tortured to actual death and I’d still refuse. 😂
SamSam,Never go full Ryan Murphy.
SamSam,"Wow you mean to tell me that a man who dated Bella Hadid since she was underage and visited all the Covid-unsafe parties in LA is self-centered and egotistical? That’s crazy, I would have never thought."
SamSam,"I'm sure the production of the show has been bad. But this article, to me, seems like it's slanted in a weird way.

The article seems written to imply that something changed from the ""original"" show to ""the current show"" due to the involvement of Levison and The Weeknd. But Levinson and The Weeknd created the show.

I'm failing to understand how the show transforms from A to B when the creators are also the same people leading now. I would understand it if you said it went from A to B to A, but that's not what it says, nor does it say Seimetz rewrote the whole thing. The current version of the show sounds exactly like Levinson and The Weeknd, so how could it have been different in the beginning and why would they have wanted it to be different?"
SamSam,Who exactly is surprised with those two involved?
SamSam,This is such a load gossipy bullshite. How is rolling Stone even in publication still?
SamSam,"""Another proposed scenario was for Depp to carry an egg in her vagina and if she dropped or cracked the egg, Tesfaye’s character would refuse to “rape” her — which sent Depp’s character into a spiral, begging him to “rape” her because she believed he was the key to her success. (This scene also was not filmed because production couldn’t find a way to realistically shoot the scene without having Depp physically insert the egg, another source explains.)""

How hard is it to shoot that? You shoot an angle of hand with egg going between her thighs, you cut to a reaction shot of her face. I mean, we've been simulating actresses being penetrated for decades without actually penetrating them, this cannot be difficult."
SamSam,"What's missing from the story, because it's sourced by anonymous people who clearly wanted to publicize Amy Seimetz's perspective, is The Weeknd's vision of the show. They say it's about a guy's sexually abusive relationship with a woman but missing is his point. 

It could be wish fulfillment smut but there could be  something interesting he's wanting to land on that just wasn't what Amy was interested in doing. 

Messy production and sexual minefields aside, artists can connect with different aspects of a vision and end up running in opposite directions. I loved The Girlfriend Experience and find Amy Seimetz a great director but this may not have been the project for her. Also the Weeknd has never produced a TV series before and relied on Sam Levinson to execute his vision but Levinson was failing everyone

Either way I'll be watching, always down to see a beautiful mess of a series."
SamSam,Nice marketing. When does it air? Sounds interesting.
SamSam,"Unpopular opinion; i can see theWeeknd and Levinsons point of view.  If you want to make a dark and disturbing noir tale about how easy people can be used and abused, you have to show that. Film it. You cant just have have characters say things are bad then turnit in to the triumphs of the independent woman.  Which it sounds like what was happening.  The original director was turning it in to something hopeful and uplifting how the female character perseveres over all obstacles- which is the opposite of the story youre trying to tell"
SamSam,"This comment section is weird. You can tell when people already have their mind made up about something based on what other people have said. It’s just a circle jerk here of people saying basically the same thing.

This is a tv show we are talking about right? They can do whatever they want as long as everyone involved is on board.

We’re getting to this point where sex and nudity in mainstream media has to be tasteful and meaningful and it’s bad if it’s it’s gratuitous. Gratuitous violence is ok though. But at the same time so many people are making a killing on onlyfans servicing that side of what people want. It’s like we’re trying to hide that part of what people are. But at the same time empower people to do whatever the fuck they want. So what if it’s torture porn? Don’t watch it if it sucks. Dude’s out there making what he wants and what some people want to see."
SamSam,[removed]
SamSam,"So after hearing the first buzz about Euphoria I started watching it but was like ‘UGH, this nudity is TEW MUCH’ …so unnecessary! I won’t be watching this garbage 

I wouldn’t want my daughter starring in ANY of that shit."
SamSam,"Article is definitely worth a read, what a fucking shitshow. HBO just lets you make the most disgusting trash if you made them a popular show I guess."
SamSam,[deleted]
SamSam,Is Sam Levinson just Larry Clark with clout? Let's think about that for a moment...
SamSam,"The Weekend is not a good man. He’s got form, he even brags about it in his lyrics. He’s another R Kelly and the industry are just letting it happen….again."
SamSam,God Sam Levinson is so creepy. I really can’t enjoy Euphoria without thinking of how a grown man was writing these sex scenes between kids and adults.
SamSam,"Do we as a culture hate edgy things now? I like to feel uncomfortable watching SOME of the media I consume. Not everything had to be feel-good cartoons, remakes, or the next mediocre superhero crap. This puritanical nonsense is very frustrating and annoying."
SamSam,Wild how HBO went from “can do no wrong” to “everything is fucked up and terrible” so quickly after Discovery took over. I hate them for what they’ve done to HBO and other stuff.
SamSam,The only thing I've learnt from this thread is that reddit absolutely hates sex lmao
Fate/stay night: Unlimited Blade Works,"Season 1 was great, but it ended pretty cleanly if I remember right. Also, Tom Hiddleston and Hugh Laurie had great chemistry, probably the best part of the show. Hopefully this isn't just some cash grab and they have a proper idea for a season 2"
Fate/stay night: Unlimited Blade Works,"This was an adaptation of a John Le Carré novel, right? Is there a 2nd novel, or will this be a writer winging it?"
Fate/stay night: Unlimited Blade Works,"The cast was ludicrously good and, for me, Tom Hollander almost stole the show. He is a brilliant character actor who can be extremely funny, such as The Thick of It, and a great pompous ass, like in Mission Impossible. But it was a shock to see him as this deeply menacing psychopath, he was spectacular."
Fate/stay night: Unlimited Blade Works,"Woah, did not expect that. It's been so long I don't remember how it ended, but I'll definitely rewatch it before this airs."
Fate/stay night: Unlimited Blade Works,"S2 starts filming this year with David Farr returning to write:

Fate/stay night: Unlimited Blade Works,Oh shit is he gonna be a day manager now
Fate/stay night: Unlimited Blade Works,"This is exciting news! The first season was excellent, in my opinion"
Fate/stay night: Unlimited Blade Works,I don't remember much about this show. Except that I really enjoyed it. So a second season with the same main actor should be good.

Fate/stay night: Unlimited Blade Works,"Damn. That's awesome!

That being said, if it's even going to film this year then it won't release until 2024. Eight years is a long time between seasons. Though it's probably not going to film until 2024 making 2025 the most likely release date placing nine years between seasons.

That's pretty uncommon!"
Fate/stay night: Unlimited Blade Works,how... can they do a second one?
Fate/stay night: Unlimited Blade Works,"Hmm... I loved the first one but I kind of feel this is unnecessary. The first ended pretty cleanly, are we to believe Hiddleston's hotel manager has just become a full on spy now? If they get the majority of the amazing cast back it will help"

Fate/stay night: Unlimited Blade Works,"I watched Season One of ‘The Night Manager’ on Amazon Prime and I am just here to say it was one of the best series I have ever seen! The acting by both Tim Hiddleston and Hugh Laurie was suburb and the location filming and production values outstanding! 

I had given up hope on there being a second season, but now my prayers have been answered!"
Fate/stay night: Unlimited Blade Works,Why do we need this
Fate/stay night: Unlimited Blade Works,IMO the series stands well on its own.  This smells a bit of desperation based on the absence of source material.  My skepticism meter is tingling.
Fate/stay night: Unlimited Blade Works,And here they swore that because the book ended here they would off course never due a second season.
Fate/stay night: Unlimited Blade Works,FINALLY
Fate/stay night: Unlimited Blade Works,Fuck yeah. This is one of the best underrated shows I’ve ever seen.
Fate/stay night: Unlimited Blade Works,Time for a rewatch to prepare
Fate/stay night: Unlimited Blade Works,YEEEEEEEESSSSSSSSSSSS!!!!!!!!!
Fate/stay night: Unlimited Blade Works,I’m down.  The first one was so damn good.
Fate/stay night: Unlimited Blade Works,"I enjoyed it.

Will be hard to replace Hugh Laurie's charisma, they'll need to find someone opposite Hiddleston to make it as good as season one."
Fate/stay night: Unlimited Blade Works,Oooh I'm down
Fate/stay night: Unlimited Blade Works,"Sweet.  Enjoyed S1, Hugh Laurie was fantastic as the antagonist."
Fate/stay night: Unlimited Blade Works,So you think Tom is out as Loki after season 2?
Fate/stay night: Unlimited Blade Works,"Happy for fans. I admired a lot of what it was trying to do, particularly with the vulnerability of the lead. But I didn’t enjoy the camera licking up the women in bath scenes and ended up tuning out. Hope it’s good for everyone else, though."
Fate/stay night: Unlimited Blade Works,Fuck yeah
Fate/stay night: Unlimited Blade Works,I've been badly wanting Ink Factory to adapt another LeCarre book. Little Drummer Girl was also amazing.
Fate/stay night: Unlimited Blade Works,hell yea!  loved watching season 1.
Fate/stay night: Unlimited Blade Works,At last !
Fate/stay night: Unlimited Blade Works,Whoa I only just watched this show for the first time last week. Really enjoyed it. This is good news as long as they can write something good for the new season.
Fate/stay night: Unlimited Blade Works,"Fantastic news! Season 1 was great and I hope the team keep up the good work in season 2. Check it out, if you haven’t already."
Fate/stay night: Unlimited Blade Works,So they are doing like a decade between seasons at this point?
Fate/stay night: Unlimited Blade Works,"I have to rewatch this when season 2 comes around, I remember that it was a really good show that I really enjoyed, but that's about it."
Fate/stay night: Unlimited Blade Works,Best news eveeeeer!!!
Fate/stay night: Unlimited Blade Works,They should call it ‘The Day Manager Too” for season 2
Fate/stay night: Unlimited Blade Works,Great news!
Fate/stay night: Unlimited Blade Works,"Holy FUCK, let’s hope they don’t cock this up"
Fate/stay night: Unlimited Blade Works,I am whelmed.
Fate/stay night: Unlimited Blade Works,well I don't remember anything about this show except that it was good so sweet
Fate/stay night: Unlimited Blade Works,"Huh wow. This is not one I saw coming. Still even if its half as good as the first season, it will be great to watch."
Fate/stay night: Unlimited Blade Works,Can someone tell me if the Indian version is good?
Fate/stay night: Unlimited Blade Works,When the sun shines through a dress… or whatever that acronym is😂.
Fate/stay night: Unlimited Blade Works,This is such good news. Too long of a wait
Fate/stay night: Unlimited Blade Works,That took a while. Definitely enjoyed season 1 a lot but it felt like a standalone story that doesn't need a sequel.
Fate/stay night: Unlimited Blade Works,High hopes but every chance this turns out like the shitshow that was *True Detective* Season 2.
Fate/stay night: Unlimited Blade Works,Jesus what a wait
Fate/stay night: Unlimited Blade Works,Interesting that an [Indian remake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Night_Manager_\(Indian_TV_series\)) is currently streaming on Disney+ Hotstar. That's a lot of buzz around this novel all of a sudden.
Fate/stay night: Unlimited Blade Works,I was just thinking about the first season and Susanne Bier recently and been wanting to do a re-watch. Glad Hiddles is on board as well as David Farr. Now lock in Bier too please!
Fate/stay night: Unlimited Blade Works,"Good God!

I'm not sure how I feel about this; it was such a perfect show in a particular moment. The movie remake by Christopher Nolan already wasn't as good."
Fate/stay night: Unlimited Blade Works,"So tom's character is a full fledged mi5/6(or whatever agency) agent and his cover is the nightmanager at hotels. 

Can we please bring back Hugh Laurie that was tortured.. But somehow survived minus a leg, hand and eye? So we get pirate Hugh with a peg leg.. Hook hand and an eye patch? Hell bent on revenge!"
Fate/stay night: Unlimited Blade Works,The fact that this aired almost a decade ago gives me a little hope that the writers have had a long time to come up with a decent story they want to tell.
Fate/stay night: Unlimited Blade Works,"Am I the only one that thought Hiddleston was super cringe? He was not right for the role at all. Everyone else was good and it didn't stop me from enjoying the show overall, but honestly shocked nobody else is saying this in the comments."
Fate/stay night: Unlimited Blade Works,"Oh hell yeah, loved season 1"
Fate/stay night: Unlimited Blade Works,Is this why Loki has been gone for two years ;(
Fate/stay night: Unlimited Blade Works,Yes! This was an amazing series.
Fate/stay night: Unlimited Blade Works,Great
Fate/stay night: Unlimited Blade Works,Inexplicably. Palpatine returned
Fate/stay night: Unlimited Blade Works,Hugh Laurie's character had a pretty clean ending.  There's places they could go for Hiddleston/Coleman.
Fate/stay night: Unlimited Blade Works,I agree completely. I thought the ending to season 1 was satisfying and tied up everything neatly. And you're right Hiddleston and Laurie together carried the show (Tom Hollander did a lot in his own right too). I felt similarly after watching the first season of Russian Doll.
Fate/stay night: Unlimited Blade Works,"Yes it was a clean end. It was awesome but I'm really afraid of what's coming. Of course I'd like another show like it but I'm afraid it would be better to not be made. Why can't these companies just leave something good alone...

I'll just forget it until it's out and not get my hopes up. If it's good, nice surprise. If it's bad, well I wasn't expecting anything"
Fate/stay night: Unlimited Blade Works,">Hopefully this isn't just some cash grab and they have a proper idea for a season 2

I wouldn't get my hopes up"
Fate/stay night: Unlimited Blade Works,"I enjoyed it thoroughly, but heard the book is even better and the main character is even more charming. Going to have to read it someday."
Fate/stay night: Unlimited Blade Works,"""You didn't stop smoking, even as a guest came and barged in. You're self-assured. Good for you."""
Fate/stay night: Unlimited Blade Works,Given season 1 is just the book it’s an entirely new story
Gotham,Who listened to this so I don't have to
Gotham,I still can’t believe they actually made this. Like who’s this for? Who wanted this?
Gotham,I watched it. It is so awful that you could screen it at a CIA black site and people would confess to anything.
Gotham,"What baffles me is that in the comics Bruce Wayne has had THREE adopted white sons and one biological son, yet the TV show felt the need to introduce an OC white son as the main character anyway."
Gotham,"It is *astonishingly* terrible. Makes Batwoman - for which this group of writers was previously responsible - look like Breaking Bad. Not a single, solitary memorable character (and the choice to center it around ""Turner Hayes"" - a character not from the comics and essayed by the absolute blandest white boy imaginable, like, seriously, imagine Ansel Elgort to the power of nine hundred - is frankly baffling). Immortal lines of dialogue such as ""Dad didn't have a problem with bisexual chicks in his porn, but having one under his roof was another story!"" and ""There are going to be some things coming out about your dad, so, I have to ask you this...did you know he was Batman?"". The overall feeling of everything and everyone in it being a store-brand knockoff (not helped by the fact that Danny Cannon, who was responsible for the look of the legitimately fun/insane Gotham, directed the pilot, so it *very* much feels like I Can't Believe It's Not Gotham, right down to the blimps). It will either die an unmourned one-season death, or inexplicably run for the next ten years."
Gotham,"I don't know they are allowed to even make such shows. If I owned the IP for Batman, I wouldn't have permitted anyone to create shows that clearly lacks quality (just by reading the script)"
Gotham,TLDL: It's shit. Don't watch it.
Gotham,"> We Watched It So You Don't Have to

Oh, haha, *don't worry*"
Gotham,"Misha Collins is good in it, everyone else… had a hard time caring for them. The HBO Titans cast was much better imo"
Gotham,"I watched half.  It was terrible.  I'm not a huge comic reader, but I'm super familiar with Batman via movies and the Arkham games. It didn't seem very connected to established stuff at all"
Gotham,I thought Gotham knights was a videogame. TIL there's a tv show too.
Gotham,"at the time this aired for me, another station was starting to air Fringe reruns so I opted to rewatch that again. but the few times it popped over it seemed bad. One of the scenes I popped over to was the bisexual porn / not in our house line"
Gotham,I normally watch at least the full pilot to make my decision. I couldn't get through it.
Gotham,Never planned to...
Gotham,"Well, I did watch it so you don't have to and... it sucks!

And it's bizarre as to how and why they made it.  This is like the sixth ""Batman without Batman"" series in the last 20 years (Birds of Prey, Gotham, Pennyworth, Titans, Batwoman, and this).  

There are some minor connections to the Batman lore, one of rebellious teens is the Joker's daughter (really), and there's a Robin based off of the Dark Knight Returns comic.  And there's Harvey Dent, who is apparently pre-Two-Face, or maybe he's a cured Two-Face, I don't know.

But it's weird how they keep repeating the same concept.  In Bird's of Prey, Batman was missing.  In Titans, Batman's there but he's always seen off-screen.  In Batwoman, Batman was missing.  In Gothman Knights, he's flat-out murdered.

A part of me wants to watch every episode knowing that it'll be cancelled for both it's content and that the CW was sold."
Gotham,"Right? An hour long podcast? At that point, I may as well just watch the dumb thing myself."
Gotham,I had no idea they made this.
Gotham,Contractual obligations
Gotham,They saw Disney's Descendants and wanted a Gotham version. They figured DC fans could introduce their kids to this but didn't do any of the marketing to make it happen and didn't make it bright and flashy enough for kids to enjoy.
Gotham,Must juice Batman IP
Gotham,People who like generic handsome people in low-budget settings?
Gotham,It's so bad it violates the Geneva conventions.
Gotham,His biological son is Chinese/Arab on his mother's side.
Gotham,"My best guess is DC/WB wanted to avoid Dick, Jason and Tim because they're on Titans.  Maybe there's a plan that we'll find out this random guy is actually Damian?  I doubt the series will last long enough for us to find out.  

When they introduced Carrie Kelly as Robin it felt like they did so because there were no other Robin's left to use.  I can't remember if they addressed her being the first Robin or if they just ignored it."
Gotham,And as bland a white boy as one could find.
Gotham,"> Dad didn't have a problem with bisexual chicks in his porn, but having one under his roof was another story!

That's... that's not an actual quote from this show, is it? You made that up, that's not a real thing said in a Batman TV show."
Gotham,"> or inexplicably run for the next ten years.

James Gunn about to be so busy directing Superman that he forgets to cancel this show"
Gotham,"What helped with Gotham is that the showrunner clearly had a ton of references in mind when they created the show and fought tooth and nail to bring them to the screen. You can see the likes of Tim Burton, Batman '66 and especially Batman the Animated series as well but also many, many non-Batman related influences to build up the world such as the Maltese Falcon, the French Connection, Double Indemnity, The Rocky Horror Picture Show (for that sweet, sweet ultraviolent camp), The Hunger, Dirty Harry, The Warriors and The Night of the Hunter. 

The showrunners stole like an artist and created something unique. These other non-Batman Gotham related shows do not do that. That looking back for influences and wearing them on their sleeve. Even when you have a director that had work on Gotham doing your pilot such as Cannon, it can't make up for a lack of a strong foundation if the showrunner never bothered to create one in the first place."
Gotham,"What makes someone a bland white boy? I don’t really understand the implication. If you think the actor is not good, wouldn’t you just say that?"
Gotham,"sucks he wasted his time and talent on this, hopefully he can get another DC role"
Gotham,And they both have the same basic plot while also having none of the same main characters.
Gotham,The TV show and video game are unrelated to each other but are both reportedly bad (for different reasons).
Gotham,"> Titans, Batman's there but he's always seen off-screen

Been a while since I've watched Titans but I was under the impression that Bruce was getting old and wanted to step away from being Batman"
Gotham,Don't you let Titans off that easy. Batman wasn't just off screen. His character was taken behind a shed and beat to death. What Batman represents was assassinated by that show.
Gotham,Batman (and now Joker) is too valuable of a property. They know their TV content is second tier and they don't want the character tainted by constrained budget. That's why Gotham had Jerome instead of Joker and didn't show Batman or Joker until the last possible episode when they knew the show had been somewhat of a success. Even then it was maybe one scene.
Gotham,"I declare Arrow to be another “Batman without Batman” show. It’s not about someone from the Bat Family, but it’s DC and Green Arrow does all the Batman stuff they would have Batman doing if they could get him."
Gotham,"Yep sounds about right. Thank you for your service.


o7"
Gotham,Sounds like a fanfic. And not the good kind.
Gotham,"I think the simple answer is that Batman has a lot of expensive technical equipment that would pose a headache for a cheap TV production to recreate and build decent action scenes around.

On the other hand, there’s no Jokermobile or Robincopter."
Gotham,"Because Warner Bros explicitly said they want to reserve live action Batman to movie theatre, so don't expect to see any live action batman show in the foreseeable future."
Gotham,For real. Just give me a minute read to confirm my preconceived notions about how shitty this is. No I do not wish to take an hour of my life to hear someone wax on about it
Gotham,Damian?
Gotham,"My hand to God, it's real. Feels like it really belongs in a nonexistent sub called r/AccidentalJohnWaters, but nonetheless, it's real."
Gotham,"I can confirm, that is an actual line of dialogue from the show's pilot episode."
Gotham,"Hey, jinx! (I posted something similar just a minute ago in response to *you*.) And, yes, Gotham's enormous range of pop-culture influences - the first season alone is, for all intents and purposes, a fever-dream remake of Miller's Crossing - enriched it enormously. One episode (""A Legion of Horribles"") is titled after a quote from Blood Meridian, for God's sakes; you're not gonna see *that* on Gotham Knights anytime soon."
Gotham,"I enjoyed the game.

I didn't enjoy the trailer for the tv show."
Gotham,"Last time we saw him, joker murdered Jason, so Dick gave Bruce a big lecture, then Bruce went and murdered the joker, then ran away"
Gotham,"Iain Glen's ""Bruce Wayne"" was the most un-Bruce I've seen on screen."
Gotham,"Yeah, it's definitely a scenario of them trying to have their cake and eat it too with these shows.  Well, we can't give them a Batman show, but we can give them one that mentions him a lot...?  

I also remember Bryan Singer was hoping Smallville would finish up prior to Superman Returns, but I think that was making too much money.  They did allow Superman and Lois, and I'm glad they did because the show is pretty good.  Superman must not be seen as hot of a property as Batman in the WB offices."
Gotham,"What Gotham did was smart compared to the other non-Batman show. Can't have Batman in all of his caped glory? Then hyperstylize the show and make it about the town, itself, and how if you stay there long enough it will either corrupt you or make you psychotic, often both. No one is normal. 

The result is a show that doesn't look like it belongs to any exact decade but instead looks like a mash-up of the 40's, 70's and 80's with its dated tech, cars, fashion, buildings. The characters speak in pulpy Raymond Chandler noir dialog and the violence...whoa, the violence. This show takes in glee in all the ways it can kill someone. 

It's these changes that make it stand-out from the other non-caped Batman takes. And why the other non-caped Batman more often than not fail to grab the audience's attention. Because nothing makes them stand out from a regular superhero show.  

As much as I love a caped Batman, I didn't miss him in Gotham because Gotham, itself, made for a more interesting character."
Gotham,"Gotham technically did have batman throughout the show, he just wasn't called batman"
Gotham,"Totally.  I remember WB touting it as inspired by Batman Begins when it first premiered, fans of the Green Arrow comics weren't too happy just how dark the show was.  And considering the main villains early on were Deathstroke and the League of Assassins, they weren't even trying to hide it."
Gotham,Apparently the show wasn't made because they wanted to Make a batman show but weren't allowed to due to rights issues it was actually because it was supposed to be a spinoff to smallvile which Green arrow also appeared on [though to be fair he was originally meant to Be Batman but wasn't allowed to so it isn't entirely untrue ] but decided for it to be disconnected but yeah Batman was a clear inspiration for the series
Gotham,"The real answer is that Batman is WB's movie franchise and not their TV one.  It appeases not only the directors they hire, but their merchandisers as well.  Apparently Nolan struck down a Robin spin-off they were planning at one point.


Batwoman had just as much gear / gadgets (on an obvious lower budget)"
Gotham,Which didn't stop The CW from making Batwoman with theoretically the same equipment.
Gotham,Yeah.
Gotham,We need to nationalize the CW before they can do any more damage to our nation's psyche.
Gotham,"> then ran away

Which is bizarre because they firmly establish that the Justice League exists in that universe but none of those characters go to check on him or go to Gotham to check on the situation."
Gotham,I feel like i need to watch Titans now
Gotham,">  most un-Bruce

He went down on Catwoman?"
Gotham,"My problems with Titans are numerous.  They screwed up basically all of the characters.  But the fight choreography of Bruce Wayne is fantastic.  Check out this scene, starting 1:25 in.  Bruce dodges or deflects everything, doesn't do any flashy or extraneous movements.  I'm not sure if there's a better live action depiction of Batman fighting.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXpb1ouD748"
Gotham,"I honestly think Superman has lost a lot of his prestige. He didn't even get a solo DCEU movie. Man of Steel doesn't count because it was a movie before DCEU was a thing and the last critically praised Superman movie was before most fans were born. I know Synder has a lot of fans who will gush over the character and Cavill's portrayal but that has never lead to the box office numbers or critical success. God knows they kept throwing money at Justice League trying to make it work.


I think considering all those factors are why they are okay giving Supes a TV show. That and his last big success was The New Adventures of Lois and Clark, which did get cancelled but still ran for 88 episodes and was able to dictate what stories the comics could and couldn't do. Even that was 30 years ago now."
Gotham,"Yup - Gotham, and its sibling show Pennyworth, worked because they knew exactly how absurd their premises were and how fundamentally bizarre Batman's whole world actually is, and they played that to the hilt, with palpable glee. If anything, actually having a fully-fledged Batman in there somewhere would've just ruined the fun.

The other shows? Forget it. They don't know how to have fun with this material, and they don't have the talent necessary to pull off a more grounded take either, so they just wind up in this awkward no-man's-land where everything always feels sort of bootleg, like a dollar-store action figure for a superhero called ""The Flying Bat"" who lives in ""Gothic City""."
Gotham,"I do like the Gotham took a little bit of everything from previous incarnations. It had some silly plots and villains like the Adam West show, it used a lot of the style from Burton and The Animated Series. It tried to be like the Nolan movies at times and then even humorous so there was some Schumacher in there. There was even some Arkham.

Sometimes it worked well, sometimes it went far too off the wall. but overall they had their vision and stuck to it."
Gotham,I love how Gotham got denser and wackier with each season.
Gotham,They even had the family fortune & company angle and how Oliver had to maintain his Playboy persona
Gotham,Hell they even made count vertigo act alot like Heath ledger Joker
Gotham,"Ah yes, the Bat Corvette. :/"
Gotham,"It's not good but there's something genuinely hypnotic about it, like you're watching it and thinking ""Oh no they're not actually doing this, are they?"" only for them to do that exact thing."
Gotham,theres no choreo here. its just a bunch of stitched together shots that almost make sense...
Gotham,Still gotta show us what happened to Batman’s parents. We just keep forgetting!
Gotham,How this show is still happening is utterly beyond me.
Gotham,We have such ice to show you.
Gotham,The camel who sells cigarettes to kids?
Gotham,"Ok, here’s my pitch for the next DC CW show.

It’s called “Guardians of Oa”, but all the Green Lanterns were killed off-screen before the first episode. Instead, we give three kids (one of them is Sinestro’s daughter, but looks nothing like Sinestro) a bright green Yamaha bike. 

They cruise around northern Idaho every now and again and fight a guy in a banana yellow ski-mask who calls himself Parallax alongside his henchwoman, Jennifer “Bleez” Braithwaite, a corporate big wig who wears ruby earrings. Villains of the week include Hector Hammond, who is an online game streamer, and the mysterious “Larfleeze”, who is a crazy homeless man with an an orange stick that he spray painted.

They always beat the villain at the end of the episode by saying “beware our power, Green Lantern’s light,” before doing a kinda ok bike trick (we’ll poorly CGI it in post).

I think it’s gonna be a hit with the fanbase."
Gotham,"Why so many non-Batman Batman shows going on at the CW? I don't get it. Is there some licensing issue that prevents them from actually using the character?

Edit: lmao not just Batman, wtf is going on with that entire cast? Why make a show focusing on the Batfamily if the only members you're actually allowed to use are Carrie Kelley's Robin and some series-original character as a Damian Wayne stand-in..."
Gotham,Nice jump up from his last gig doing VO for an AEW promo for Malakai Black.
Gotham,Batman's parents got murdered by fuckin Pinhead!
Gotham,"**""Have you ever** ***danced*** **with the** ***devil*** **in the pale moonlight?""**"
Gotham,Wait CW still has shows?
Gotham,Ok
Gotham,Great. Another Batman show without Batman.
Gotham,Why? What happened to Batmans parents?
Gotham,"IIRC, they died when Krypton exploded."
Gotham,I would've been so much happier with another season of Legends of Tomorrow instead. At least that show was fun!
Gotham,"With most CW shows, especially their superhero ones the first 1-2 seasons are usually quiet good but man i refuse to believe when it comes to Gotham Knights it will be like that. There is just no way."
Gotham,"You mean ""*Batman"" Beyond* you?

...I'll show myself out."
Gotham,"This is Joe Chill. He kills Batman’s parents.

You’re thinking of Joe Camel. He’s a camel.

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Camel"
Gotham,I love this haha
Gotham,Not a DC CW but this reminds me of the mos vespa gang from boba hutt
Gotham,"WB has a thing about reserving Batman for films. That's how we've had Birds of Prey, Gotham, Pennyworth, The Penguin, and now this steaming pile."
Gotham,"In fairness they are using Stephanie Brown, along with Harper and Cullen Row too (they are part of the Batfamily, but only just). I do find it weird they're using Stephanie without Tim Drake though, since she's mainly one of his supporting characters. I wouldn't be surprised if it turns out this Turner Hayes character ends up being revealed as Tim. It just seems strange they've created an original character for this show. It looks shit anyway, so it's not like its gonna have a high viewership, but if they had at least made him one of Bruce's already established sons then more people might watch it. It makes me think that Titans is the reason why they had to create an original character. They couldn't have two versions of the same character on different shows."
Gotham,I've got some bad news...
Gotham,"They went to a special, happy farm where they make buttermilk"
Gotham,And then he ran back in time to save them and changed the timeline
Gotham,This show is cheaper.
Gotham,"Well, Batwoman was their first attempt at Batman without Batman and we all know how that went..."
Gotham,I fucking wish
Gotham,"If killing a kids parents turned them into a vigilante, Joe Camel would have have millions of Batmen after him."
Gotham,"I thought that was Joe Cool.

EDIT: For anyone who doesn't know what I'm referencing, [this scene from Harley Quinn.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hvddWn8SSQo&t=60s)"
Mushi-Shi,"It’s keeping this pace, it’s like a come down, relax, meditate sort of anime. It takes time to build up the concepts and is refreshing new and relaxing to its core. There are 1000 fast paced anime’s out there but barely to none quite 5he opposite like mushi."
Mushi-Shi,"It's amazing, but it is an entirely episodic atmospheric show with no overarching plot, and the pace is very much the same all the way through. That's not for everyone, but if you can enjoy it anyway you're in for a treat, and s2 is even better though still the same style 

Id suggest watching a couple more episodes because they can vary a lot in tone, some are quite soothing while others can be disturbing, but its not really something I'd recommend binging or trying to mass watch. I found a lot of enjoyment of of watching it once a day or just when I felt like it more than anything."
Mushi-Shi,I watched the entirety of it over the course of 2 years. Just sometimes put on an episode. It's a very well made show and it's simply beautiful (the backgrounds/backdrops are all amazing). Each episode is basically a standalone story so you can just put on an episode when you're in the mood for something relaxing.
Mushi-Shi,"Lean in to the slow pace of the show. Each episode doesn’t really have a lot of conflict since Ginko just kind of shows up and knows how to solve the problem. 

The power of the show is in the visuals and music and just how dreamy everything is presented. Everyone (and I mean EVERYONE) that I have recommended the show to has come back and said they fell asleep while trying to watch it, but they all eventually went back and ended up loving it. I think that’s ultimately a positive for how chill and relaxed the show is."
Mushi-Shi,Yes
Mushi-Shi,"No it's not good .......... it's superb. Easily one of my favorite anime shows. The stories are intriguing and also very relaxing. The animation and stories are perfect as is the music. It's not a show to binge watch though, each episode needs to be absorbed and mulled over, so just watch one or maybe two a day, perhaps in the evening before bed for the ultimate in relaxation."
Mushi-Shi,"It's among the greatest anime ever made, so yes."
Mushi-Shi,One one of the greatest anime ever produced.
Mushi-Shi,[deleted]
Mushi-Shi,Interesting. Mushi means Pussy in German.
Mushi-Shi,"I love it, but it's never really fast-paced.  There is rarely ever any urgency in the progression of the plot and Gin is not some fighting underdog protagonist, so the tone of the story is often very chill and atmospheric."
Mushi-Shi,"Definitely try to get in a meditative mindset and you're going to have a blast with this. The soundtrack alone makes this show, it's fantastic."
Mushi-Shi,"Huh... that sounds interesting!

I’ll definitely test this out... Thankyou :)"
Mushi-Shi,Funimation.com has season 1 and Crunchyroll.com has season 2.
Mushi-Shi,Californication is 30 minutes.
Mushi-Shi,"your concern shouldn't be half hour dramas but the number of episodes in a season.

I always think shorter seasons allow for more quality and cuts the filler episodes down. Lost could of been so much better (it is still one of my favourite dramas) if they cut the number of episodes down to 11/12 per season. A lot of pointless subplots could of been dropped and more time on the important plots.

Homeland is one new series I think is bang on with the the length of the episode and the number of episodes. The pace just works so well and there is hardly any filler episodes and pointless subplots.

Breaking Bad is another, the number of episodes just fits with the story and allows the pace of the story to excel and keep viewers interested."
Mushi-Shi,"HBO's ""In Treatment"" is one example."
Mushi-Shi,"Sports Night was kind of a ""dramedy"" and was a half hour long.  Of course, it was written by Aaron Sorkin before he was hailed as the greatest thing ever so it got cancelled.  Same goes for Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip."
Mushi-Shi,"How to make it in america was a drama in half hour format, a pretty damn good one at that"
Mushi-Shi,"They're not labeled as dramas, but that doesn't mean they don't exist.

Look at How I Met Your Mother. I realized a few months ago that I'm not watching for the humor anymore. It's funny, but that's not why I'm sticking around. It's a good story that stretches over the entire series. That's not typical of a sitcom. A lot of other sitcoms at least dabble in dramatic episodes.

Labelling half hour shows ""sitcoms"" and hour long shows ""dramas"" is really just tradition at this point. There are plenty of hour long shows that largely use humor, and there are sitcoms that tug at your emotions. The main problem with half hour shows is that it is hard to flesh out a full story in 23 minutes. You can, but people don't always want that. Having a half hour show allows you to use pretty flimsy episode plots but keep it going with jokes. An hour of jokes is hard, just like half an hour of emotional drama is hard as well. "
Mushi-Shi,"I suspect one of the big reasons is that (good) modern dramas have to (or I suppose should try to) get through two tasks in every episode: 1)A theme/plot that's self contained within the episode, so that the viewer feels a sense of fulfillment when the credits roll 2) an ongoing plot or structure that ties the episodes to each other creating storylines that span multiple episodes.

If you omit the first of these, you get dramas in the form that HBO has recently been experimenting with, where each episode moves a series of parallel plots forward, but doesn't really have the full internal story structure.  This relies on having a fixed and loyal set of viewers who don't need to be caught up on backstory, and who aren't going to drop in for random episodes during the season and expect to enjoy them.  That kind of audience doesn't really exist in the numbers broadcast networks need to be ratings competitive.

If you omit the latter, on the other hand, you get procedurals, which come with their own extra workload in the form of every episode needing a complete narrative arc and to differentiate itself from other episodes of the show, as well as making sure the audience knows who the characters are and what their role in the plot is. This last part is trickier in dramas, especially non-procedural dramas, because much of the meat comes from complex character relationships and interactions that are built by knowing the characters' pasts.  Comedies often get away with much simpler up-front characterization, because while the comedy *can* come from complex character interactions, it doesn't *have* to.

Either way, dramas have a lot of ground to cover, which is probably easier to do in an hour long format.

I would disagree that there are no low-key hour-long dramas.  There are rarely ""hang-out"" dramas in the way that there are ""hang-out"" comedies, but I think that's an inevitable function of what people look for in a drama versus a comedy (watching people be funny without much at stake is enjoyable.  Watching people interact/fight without much at stake is boring/irritating, respectively.)"
Mushi-Shi,Entourage was a 30 minute show.
Mushi-Shi,"Weeds, United States Of Tara, Nurse Jackie, etc.  They have some comedy elements, but are also dramas.

They also all seem too short.  You really can't get a good drama going with 4+ plot-lines and 15+ characters with just 1/2 hour.  "
Mushi-Shi,Moral Orel ended up being a ten-minute drama.
Mushi-Shi,"The soap opera is a popular half hour long drama. Most of the American soaps switched over to the hour long format in the 70's, but British soaps like Coronation Street or EastEnders maintain the half hour format that they have had for decades."
Mushi-Shi,how i met your mother sorta turned into one.
Mushi-Shi,"I think it could be easily done. If you look at most American dramas they have almost always have two or more storylines going on at one time. I think if they widdled down the cast and focused the storyline it could be done. Also weren't some Twilight Zone episodes only 30 minutes? I definitely think that anthology series could benefit to going back to a 30 minutes format. Especially thriller type stories because usually there is a twist you can see coming by halfway through the hourlong episode, while with 30 minutes it packs more of a punch. "
Mushi-Shi,"There are a fair amount of half-hour dramedies out there. In addition to the ones already mentioned, there's *Bored to Death*, *Hung*, *MASH*, and *The Wonder Years*. (I realize that I might be stretching the definition of ""dramedy"" with some of those.)

You're right, though. There aren't many true half-hour dramas."
Mushi-Shi,"Dramas generally require longer/more complicated character arcs (good ones do, anyway) which are harder to setup and maintain over a shorter time. Even the sitcom dramedies listed here are better when watched as a block of episodes, and not individually. Heck, some dramas are better when you watch them in blocks. I recently re-watched season 4 of *Breaking Bad* over a weekend, and got more out of it than watching them piecemeal."
Mushi-Shi,"one reason is money.  the shows mentioned in the thread that are half hour dramas - are pretty much all cable shows with no commercials.  HBO and Showtime make so much money that they can have higher budgets, and aren't bogged down with having to make a certain profit per hour(or half hour) from commercials. it really boils down to the cost of television per hour.  an hour long show will make more money, because, per hour, vs. comedies, it costs less.  most of the half hour comedies on tv that are multi-camera(stage based sit-coms) are less per episode than single camera.  shows with exorbitant salaries not included, of course... but those salaries are only justified once that show is a success, and they can afford the salary.  basically, the production of dramas is more expensive per hour than comedies.  so it's not good business to spend MORE money to produce a show that is a half hour, if you're not making enough ad revenue on it.  and if the follow up question is 'why aren't there hour long comedies' ... then you get into story, and sustaining a comedy audience for longer than a half hour, etc.   "
Mushi-Shi,why are there no hour long comedies
Mushi-Shi,The Big C
Mushi-Shi,"I think the question is why aren't there many 1 hour comedies? It is hard to come up with good material for 22-23 minutes, let alone twice that amount. That is why. Or the quality would suffer."
Mushi-Shi,I believe it is because they've all been saved for our mamas.
Mushi-Shi,Because there's not enough shit to get through in just 23 minutes.
Mushi-Shi,"Almost every so-called comedy on premium cable is actually a half-hour drama. Very few actually have that much comedy. Weeds is the only one with consistent comedy and drama that comes to mind. (And there are a few pure comedies like Party Down and Bored to Death [at least the good season, the first].) But other than those, they're close to all straight dramas with a few jokes here and there, but not any more than an hourlong that isn't pure serious business.

And Doctor Who for a very, very long time was half-hour.

Also Australia and the UK have nightly half-hour soaps. They're absolute garbage, but they exist (and they're not the same as daytime soaps)."
Mushi-Shi,Weeds & United States of Tara too.  They are more of dramady though.
Mushi-Shi,"At the end of every episode, I yell at my TV, ""That's not it is it? There has to be more!""

Those 30-minute episodes really pack a punch."
Mushi-Shi,Also Secret Diary of a Call Girl I believe.
Mushi-Shi,"Yeah. Homeland is great. Best first season of a show I've ever seen.

I guess my point is not that it should be shorter to get rid of the filler in episodes. I'm saying shorter episodes would allow you to write a *different kind* of episode - less plot driven.

But it's a pretty vague concept to bring across, so yeah... sorry if I'm not making sense."
Mushi-Shi,"I agree with this absolutely. 10-13 is a good number. It cuts out the stupid subplots and keeps the story moving at a fast pace. Look at The Shield, any HBO show, or Breaking Bad. I actually feel like with Lost my favorite season was season 4 because it was short and the plot moved along a lot faster. They were offing people right and left and just pushing through big reveals nearly every episode. Battlestar Galactica could have been flawless if they had cut out the filler episodes, especially the filler in the last season. If they ever bring back Star Trek to TV I hope they do it as a 13 episode series. I feel like shows like Fringe and even older series like DS9 would be a lot better if the episode count was cut down to 13 episodes. "
Mushi-Shi,YES! This is exactly what I mean when I say that it's not just hour longs in shortened format... but that it allows you innovate storytelling by necessity of the shorter format.
Mushi-Shi,"Studio 60 was GOLD. I still can't believe it was canceled and so many people still have no idea what it is. It could have been so amazing. Haven't seen Sports Night yet though, I'm just starting the West Wing."
Mushi-Shi,"it came along when dramedy wasn't even really a thing yet, which was too bad. it was ahead of it's time. "
Mushi-Shi,"Also, Entourage."
Mushi-Shi,"How I Met Your Mother has always been a character driven comedy. Makes very loyal viewers, but makes it a much harder show to start watching, which leads to lower viewers."
Mushi-Shi,"I agree with you actually. How I Met Your Mother's best episodes are the ones with pathos and real emotions (e.g. this week's episode).

Part of the reason why I think current Parks and Rec is so brilliant is precisely for this reason. It's about the characters and their interactions more than it is about the humour. It feels like the comedy is the backdrop to tell the real story - and that's a good thing.

After a Parks and Rec episode, my overriding emotion is not one of post-humour elation, but warm-hearted happiness. What makes that show great is the drama elements. 

"
Mushi-Shi,">The main problem with half hour shows is that it is hard to flesh out a full story in 23 minutes. 

See ""The Guild"" or ""Awkward Black Woman."""
Mushi-Shi,i don't think how i met your mother is really a comedy at all anymore...i hardly laugh like i used to and it seems overly melodramatic now.  really not enjoying it and only continuing to watch out of stubborness cause i've put so much time into it already.
Mushi-Shi,"Good point. I didnt say there were no low key hour longs, just that they are kind of the exception to the rule. Friday Night Lights, for example, is one (although it does use soap elements).

Another one I can think of is Mad Men. In fact I think that show has become stronger since it moved from plots created around outside pressures, i.e. the plot is driven by a force compelling the character to react to it (typically the murder/case of the week in procedurals) and in this case Don Draper's identity theft back story, to a more meandering tone, where the story is driven purely by current character interactions.

I actually think Mad Men is the loosest of contemporary drama shows in terms of ongoing plot structure, and that's one of the things that makes it stand out.

 "
Mushi-Shi,"Entourage was a comedy. At least it started that way, a show about how awesome it is to be these people. Kinda changed a bit after the first season."
Mushi-Shi,"Seek out Teachers (UK). Amazing ~48 minute comedy. Some drama, but less as it goes on."
Mushi-Shi,Most of the Twilight Zone episodes were 30 minutes. 
Mushi-Shi,"That's what I'm saying - it's a different format. Obviously, squeezing a Walking Dead into 23 minutes wont work. 

But if you write to the format it can work. Hour long dramas are all very plot based- they have to be, because there needs to be something that keeps you watching for that long. 

The aforementioned 'Mushi-shi' doesn't work like that. It's very light on plot, which allows it to delve into ideas about life and spirituality (something that would be a drag over 45-60 minutes). And it's more powerful than a lot of full length dramas I've seen lately - but on an entirely different level. Of course, such themes can also be adressed in full hour dramas - but only *via* plot. 

I guess it just seems worth exploring from a storytelling standpoint."
Mushi-Shi,So is Californication.
Mushi-Shi,"Same here, I am so used to hour long shows now that 30 minute ones make it seem like I'm watching a mini series or something...I crave for more.."
Mushi-Shi,"definatly, I think there should be half hour dramas but what succesful ones have their been?

maybe a comedy/drama would work in a half hour time frame. but the flavour right now is hour long dramas and half hour comedys."
Mushi-Shi,I just want to interject and put Game of Thrones season 1 into the best season of television ever contest. Homeland's finale felt very anti-climatic to me. 
Mushi-Shi,The West Wing is great. Studio 60 was so-so. Sports Night ain't bad. *Please note this comment was made while walking*
Mushi-Shi,"I think Sports Night is Sorkins best work still...so if you liked Studio 60 and if you enjoy the first four seasons of West Wing (after that Sorkin left... it's still good, but takes almost the entire 5th season to regain its stride) then you will have a pregnant over Sports Night."
Mushi-Shi,It's on Netflix Streaming.  I just started watching.  Too bad it's got a laugh track. 
Mushi-Shi,Scrubs. Yes it's very much a comedy but the dramatic portions are what made that show what it is. 
Mushi-Shi,"There was tons of drama in that show! 

""Vince might not get to do the movie!"" 

""Oh, never mind."""
Mushi-Shi,"TIL: Entourage was a comedy.

This may be one of the most closely kept secrets in HBO's history."
Mushi-Shi,"I should probably revise my statement. there's not enough time to get through the shit **AND** have a worthwhile answer for some of it in 23 minutes. Even if you cut down the shit to fit into 23 minutes, it wouldn't feel worth it. It would have to be something silly and dainty to be condensed into a 23 minute long show. Thats why all the dramas are in 30 minute long+ shows."
Mushi-Shi,I hate to say it but this season's Walking Dead would have been far better in a half-hour format.  The long monologues and endless dialog scenes could have been tightened up in a huge way.
Mushi-Shi,"Nope, Deadwood wins TV forever.  Don't get me wrong, I liked GoT, but Deadwood is just better."
Mushi-Shi,"I had read the books twice before I watched GoT. So I guess I was biased and more prone to be disappointed by what was missing. 

However, the fact that I still thought it was a great season stands for how strong that show is."
Mushi-Shi,"West Wing Season 5 Spoiler: [spolier](/s ""I know, the whole kidnapping story is ridiculous, but it picks up in Season 6 when Bartlett's sucessor becomes the focus."")"
Mushi-Shi,"The laugh track fades over time, and I think it's gone by season 2. I don't mind laugh track for a multi-camera sitcom based on punchlines, but it made no sense for Sports Night."
Mushi-Shi,"This is one of the other ones I was thinking off. That, and a few episodes of Fresh Prince popped into my head. Mostly typical sitcom, but when it got serious, it got *serious.*"
Mushi-Shi,E and his girlfriend broke up and they hate each other now and *totally* will never get back together. God the last 2 seasons of Entourage were awful. 
Mushi-Shi,"Yeap.

http://www.slashfilm.com/votd-every-week-on-entourage/"
Mushi-Shi,Have you seen the 2 or 3 Louie episodes that are pretty much just drama?
Mushi-Shi,"Maybe. Walking Dead is annoying because everything is so segmented and obvious. It's true the mid-season finale was great, but that only worked because they spent 5 fucking episodes looking for that stupid girl... way past the point where every viewer was saying 'MOVE ON ALREADY'.


It's like... the show works when it wants to, but it doesn't get there by doing actual storytelling work on a complex level. That's why it can be so great for short bursts but just doesn't satisfy in the long run."
Mushi-Shi,I have yet to watch that. Have it all lined up though. 
Mushi-Shi,"Even in the first episode it really took me out of the show as I was not expecting it at all, but damn if the writing it's top notch.  "
Mushi-Shi,Oh no! No one takes Johnny Drama seriously!
Mushi-Shi,Every season was awful. It wasn't a comedy or a drama. It just… was.
Mushi-Shi,"The last 2 seasons? Try the last 5 seasons, after they did Aquaman the show went downhill fast."
Mushi-Shi,"To be clear, I have never seen an episode of Louie."
Mushi-Shi,"I almost stopped recording Walking Dead during that period. My roommates kept on telling me that they were building up to something, which was obvious. What I hated was that they built it up for that long.

IMHO, Walking Dead shines when they focus on the threat to the community, the fear, and the fucking zombies. Trying to move it into anything else always ends up wishy-washy or worse."
Mushi-Shi,"[Here's a great example.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsQBpG-3TQY&t=2m18s) This is the first episode, where Jeremy is interviewed. The audience laughs for no reason, and worst of all, they *applaud at the end.* That is what drove me crazy."
Mushi-Shi,Turtles new business venture failed again! How will Turtle ever deal with this devastating failure. 
Mushi-Shi,"I thought it just really started to drag after the Medieon story arc. There were parts I still liked of the other seasons. Vince became a very boring characters but Drama and Arie still had some interesting stories. But I've got to say when Turtle was beginning to be more of a main character the show took a serious dip. It's just unbelievable that anyone, especially hot women would like that guy."
Mushi-Shi,"If you're interested, it's a great show. And the episode 'Bully' is absolute genius - you'll see what I mean once you've watched it.
 "
Mushi-Shi,"I think ""God"" is a better episode for what your describing, but that might just be me."
Mushi-Shi,I will now go forth and torrent the shit out of it.
Mushi-Shi,First season's on Netflix Instant.
Mushi-Shi,Torrents > Netflix.
Mushi-Shi,you say that like you're not being a douchebag
Mushi-Shi,"A less contentious summary would be local copy > streaming, which is absolutely true and what I like to think KRAKEN meant."
Mushi-Shi,Calm down you cunt. (see there I was being a douchebag! :D)
Mushi-Shi,"The manga is one of the best I've ever read.  I don't give a shit about vikings or Nordic lore at all, but it was very compelling and the art was incredible."
Mushi-Shi,I live for Thorkells scenes.
Mushi-Shi,"I just started watching it recently and I absolutely love it.

No spoilers, but for anyone who plans on giving it a shot watch at least the first 4 episodes before you make up your mind about the series. That's where the hook of Vinland Saga becomes apparent"
Mushi-Shi,Ya but Vinland saga ain’t shonen genre. It’s really more of the seinen genre.....
Mushi-Shi,Seconded. I can't recommend this series highly enough and am glad to see it's getting the attention it deserves on mainstream subs.
Mushi-Shi,"If you liked Cowboy Bebop, watch Trigun, too. Same creator and space-western feel. Not crazy long, either. I’m not an anime guy, either, but loved it.

Edit: guess I was wrong about the Bebop and Trigun connection. No idea why I put that together. Both are good, though!"
Mushi-Shi,"Vinland Saga was top tier, the last 8ish episodes felt like some prime game of thrones material."
Vexed,"So you are praising a show you haven't even finished? I've seen it a few times (as it's only 9 episodes). The first season, which was only 3 episodes, was very good. After that, it wasn't nearly as good. After the loss of Lucy Punch it wasn't the same"
Vexed,"I binged this around Xmas, I remember liking the first season more than the second"
Vexed,"Yup, enjoyed this a lot. Lucy Punch is brilliant. She has a great turn on Doc Martin for a couple seasons and is hysterically tightly wound in Bad Teacher with Cameron Diaz."
Vexed,Second season turned to shit.
Vexed,"Yeah on season 2 now. It's not just the loss of Lucy Punch that is down to btw, Howard Overman, the actual writer wasn't even on board.

However, Punch's and Stephens' chemistry was off the charts."
Vexed,The second is still pretty damn funny though!
Vexed,It was good
Vexed,"Watching this right now. I listened to the podcast Bad Blood, so a lot of the info is not new to me. But, seeing it: the lab, the people, is fascinating. "
Vexed,"Hey man, wassup?              
...Dude, that Internet these days is so dope, man! School sucks!        
...You can just go on that stinking internet!"
Vexed,I loved the part where he tried to bribe the woman. I couldn't stop laughing.
Vexed,More people need to watch this show! I really hope it doesn't get cancelled
Vexed,"Even though he didn't have a real uniform, that stripper totally caught me off-guard. Much Sexy Time!!"
Vexed,"If you guys enjoyed this make sure you watch at least the Season 1 finale where he helps the private investigator, one of the funniest things I've ever watched"
Vexed,I lost it at the kids taking the photos with their alcohol. 
Vexed,I just started watching this show yesterday and it's so friggen hilarious! Love his awkward confidence.
Vexed,I live in Santa Clarita and know one of the guys that tried to buy alcohol. He is totally somebody that you would expect to do that. At least one of the customers was real. That was a really funny bit and even funnier because it took place in my home town.
Vexed,If they ever cancel this show I will probably burn down television. 
Vexed,"This is one of the funniest new shows of the year.

I don't think he has done a skit that hasn't made me laugh."
Vexed,After watching this video I went right to on demand and binged.
Vexed,"car wash bit was great, when the poop goes in his mouth... ""Pfffthhhfthfpppppfthhhhhththtffttppppfffththhththtft"""
Vexed,Does this guy do the voice of Tina on Bob's Burgers?
Vexed,[deleted]
Vexed,"Oh man, when he tried to slip that one woman a bribe... ""Oh... no. I cant accept this"" fucking hilarious!"
Vexed,Of course a skateboarder is the first guy to try and buy beer. 
Vexed,that liquor store is right by my house. what's ironic is that that liquor store used to be infamous for selling liquor to minors. so seeing the reaction on the owner's face when the cop walked in made it that much more priceless.
Vexed,"In the Midwest state I Iive in a police officer described the sale as being once money is accepted as payment there for the liquor store would still be breaking the law by selling to minors even when they do not walk out the door with the item they purchased. 
 In stings if the minor is successful in purchasing alcohol or tobacco they leave the item on the counter then a cop comes in to write the ticket. Typically a officer in street clothes. "
Vexed,"When talking about alcohol I always find it soo weird that you have to be 21 even just to buy a beer, or intake any sorts of alcohol, in the US.

I mean, I come from denmark where there is no age limit on drinking alcoholic beverages, and the minimum age for buying is 16 for >16,5% alcohol."
Vexed,Can anyone point me to somewhere i can watch the show from episode 1 on?
Vexed,Wow I never thought I would see something involving Santa Clarita
Vexed,Can someone tell me if he is really fucking with real people or if they are actors. I can't tell. It becomes a bit of a prank show if the people have no clue what's going on and their reactions are real.
Vexed,I feel like I need to start watching this show.
Vexed,I could not stop laughing at the chickens in the tree. When he got some in his mouth I literally had to bite my lip to stop from laughing too hard and waking my wife. 
Vexed,That high school he went to is about 10 miles from Santa Clarita. It's Sylmar High School and I know this because I went there... Why would he say a few blocks away!! Ahhh!! Nathan!! *fist*
Vexed,[Stripper be all...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&v=Kv1lSH4hK-w#t=352)
Vexed,"So, i know that liquor store, my friends live across the street from it, can confirm they're kind of shady."
Vexed,"I think it's a really funny show too, but how much of it do you guys think is fake?  I don't think he actually accepted $200 from the car wash owner, etc."
Vexed,how this guy has not got his ass beaten by now is beyond me.  its fuckin funny as hell though.  
Vexed,I can't watch this show... the awkwardness makes me cringe too much.
Vexed,"Just sell them apple cider and yeast at a very marked up rate. Tell them to sprinkle the yeast in the cider and wait 2 weeks. Voila!

It's not illegal either."
Vexed,Wait so is the interviews scripted or does he do these and watch people's reactions?
Vexed,Whoever came up with that skit is a comic fucking genius. That was brilliant.
Vexed,"This show is gonna get huge. Not many people watch it, but most people who do love it. 
"
Vexed,I can go there after I go to Magic Mountain!
Vexed,This dude has a very Sacha Baron Cohen way about him.  Very likely one of his main influences.
Vexed,"That kid and I share the same name, and I talk to my friends about the dope and stinking Internet every day... We are one."
Vexed,I wonder if Comedy Central earns any real profit from this show with all the lawsuits they must get.
Vexed,"I don't get this show, but I don't think I need to cuz it's funny."
Vexed,You can't just bring a stripper into my business. 
Vexed,I can't believe you have to be 21 to legally buy alcohol in the US... You silly Americans.
Vexed,"Backward cap and glasses. Yeah that was the poochy ""cool"" dress code."
Vexed,"Hey! I've been to that liquor store! They didn't attempt to sell me alcohol, though. "
Vexed,"This show is hilarious.  The brand of humor might not be for everyone, but if you appreciate awkward humor then you will love it.  If you spend the entire time trying to figure out if it's""real"" or if it's scripted then you are missing the point.  Just sit back and laugh."
Vexed,Not a fan of this show. I think I am too old. 
Vexed,I don't think would drink a beer expired 3 years before.
Vexed,"So...would this actually work? I don't think so. This is completely illegal, right?
"
Vexed,"So how much of this show is actually real? I assume the business owners are in on it, but are they actual owners? Or just actors? And are the interactions with the public real? Or is everything fake?"
Vexed,Wait. What? New episodes?! Since when?!?!
Vexed,Makes it even funnier those in the know. I grew up down the road from this liquor store and selling alcohol to minors has been a real thing for the past 20 years in this area. As a minor I would hear about it myself.
Vexed,"Brings me back to the days of my youth, when I had a room full of ""Rock Music"" posters."
Vexed,I just realized he was behind that whole Dumb Starbucks thing.
Vexed,isn't the actual sale itself illegal in most states?
Vexed,There is one episode where they try to market a pet store at a pet-cemetery by getting a HUGE tombstone and putting the ad on it. Just thinking about it makes me smile.  
Vexed,Why did that white kid have to bother me at the steps that day when I was just waiting for the damn bus to take me home. Damn you Sylmar High School.
Vexed,"Hoooooo. Hooooooooooooo. Hoooooooooooooooooooooooo.

Hooooooooooooooooooooly shit! This might be the greatest TV show ever. I have to watch this."
Vexed,"I had never seen this show before.

I guess I'm in the minority, but I didn't find that funny at all."
Vexed,"I love comedy, I've watched all the classic comedy movies, shows, etc. I love a good comedy show, but man, this show is kind of boring. It has a few good jokes, but it is just really slow and boring. Nathan's since of humor is kind of dry, so I suppose it appeals to a certain audience."
Vexed,It was painful to watch Nathan accept that award from the carwash. The pats on the back.........
Vexed,"Just started watching this show on Amazon Prime, I haven't laughed so hard at a show on Comedy Central in a while. At first I thought it was another one of those stupid shows on there that would run the course of a season and get cancelled. Boy was I wrong, Nathan Fielder is a genius. Definitely would recommend to anyone that likes cringey humor like Curb Your Enthusiasm."
Vexed,"I don't understand this show..

What is it's actual purpose? Or is it one of those shows for TV shucks?"
Vexed,Too long.  Cut this down to 45 seconds and you might have a funny video.  Six minutes?  Talk about beating a dead horse.
Vexed,"I can't stand the pseudo-reality, prank shit!  Most of the comedy is based on the fact that these are normal people put in awkward situations.  That interview with the woman was not believable.  She was clearly an actor.

The Daily Show correspondents do it right and their interviews are both hilarious and believable.  This is just more played-out crap."

Vexed,I was on holiday on a Greek island when I was 12 and I got served beer!
Vexed,It kind of reminds me of Reviews with Myles Barlow. Hopefully it doesn't meet the same end.

Vexed,Need a NSFW for the end with male stripper

Vexed,The Reddit marketing campaign for this show is still in full swing I see.
Vexed,That kid was my favorite part of last nights episode.
Vexed,"teacher sucks but the internet rules ya know. so anyways I got this cool tip. Theres this liquor store down the block. its called boo kay f...plaza f...l..liquor store and it sells alcohol to minors.

ok i gotta go back to skipping class"
Vexed,back to skipping class

Vexed,"O god I couldn't watch beyond that point, I changed the channel."
Vexed,I tried to bribe someone once. It did not go down very well.
Vexed,And with five dollars. 
Vexed,I burst up when the dragon went through the hotel lobby.
Vexed,He's so awkward it's amazing.  He just digs him self deeper and deeper into holes hahaha
Vexed,I loved the part where Nathan went to a liquor store Ha Ha Ha
Vexed,"Hello fellow redditors. Have you also seen $CAMPAIGN_PROGRAM. I really enjoyed $TARGET_SCENE, I could not stop laughing. Ha ha ha."
Vexed,"everyone has to know this is a joke in the video.... giant cameras filming you, nothing is going to be an honest reaction"
Vexed,"I feel like one of the advantages this show has is that not many people watch it. We need to find that sweet spot of enough people watching to keep it on air but not enough to make Nathan Fielder a well known guy, so his segments in public will still work. "
Vexed,definitely one of the funniest shows on television right now imo.
Vexed,"So far viewership is up from last year, but still nowhere near workaholics levels during it's first few seasons.  It's even doing mediocre compared to drunk history.  So who knows.  "
Vexed,"I don't really have a desire to, all the commercials portray him as not funny, just awkward."
Vexed,I just assumed it was a fake cop and it looks like I was way more correct than I expected.

*Paul Rudd tosses Kid out of moving van*"
Wet Hot American Summer,My cousin Craig co-wrote/performed the score. That’s him singing “Higher and Higher” during Coop’s training montage. He’s been buddies with David Wain since they were kids.
Wet Hot American Summer,David Wain and Michael Showalter have been responsible for some of the best American comedy in the last 30 years.
Wet Hot American Summer,"They're all from The State. I just can't believe just how many shows fall under the David Wain/State umbrella. I mean you have all the WHAS stuff, Children's Hospital and all of those related spinoffs, Reno 911; plus a lot of them also appear on shows like Party Down and Veronica Mars. It's crazy."
Wet Hot American Summer,"I was legitimately surprised at how great First Day Of Camp was. I thought it was better than the movie. I remember not being thrilled by 10 Years Later but i havent seen it since release, should probably rewatch it"
Wet Hot American Summer,The movie was pretty solid
Wet Hot American Summer,Look at the burning love cast
Wet Hot American Summer,Victor and Neil hiding from Gene always cracks me up.
Wet Hot American Summer,"**”The phone the phone where’s the FUCKING phone?!”**

I’ve loved the comedy from The State for years, They Came Together is equally as funny. Michael Showalter has also really done amazingly as a director, The Baxter is one of my favorites and he directed The Eyes of Tammy Faye"
Wet Hot American Summer,"While I think 10 Years Later is pretty bad (It still had its moments. Adam Scott worried that people won't like his new nose job is hilarious), First Day of Camp is easily one of the funniest things I've seen and I think it's better than the movie."
Wet Hot American Summer,I’m going to fart my way right into that snatch.
Wet Hot American Summer,Children's Hospital?
Wet Hot American Summer,The tv series is one of the funniest things me and my wife have ever seen. What’s almost as funny is reading reviews (back when Netflix had them) and seeing how many people don’t get it.
Wet Hot American Summer,"Oh, fuck my cock!"
Wet Hot American Summer,"I was about to comment saying “oh my favorite part is…” but I realized I have too many favorite parts from this bizarre, bizarre series. Truly love all the characters."
Wet Hot American Summer,"I loved the scene where Michael Cera got shot. Not because I have anything against him, it was just really fucking funny"
Wet Hot American Summer,I'd like to see a series of episodes with the same event written by one of the cast.
Wet Hot American Summer,I love the part when the crew goes into town for supplies in the movie.
Wet Hot American Summer,"I'll give an alternate take on it: 

WHAS was a low-budget film from 2001 that barely made back a tenth of it's $1.8m budget at the box office. It wouldn't be noteworthy save for the sheer amount of future talent that was in the film. The film lacks structure, doesn't explore any themes meaningfully, and ultimately comes across like a short-sighted homage to 1970s sexploitation teen films. The Netflix shows are better, but if you read the nice things critics say about them in reviews, you will notice that they almost universally point to the shows being just like the film (which critics hated before they knew the cast would be famous - hmm). Those shows undoubtedly do not get made if the original cast doesn't go on to be massively famous for other things. 

If you want to contrast it to something similar, right around the same time we got another failure-turned-cult-classic: Mystery Men. Packed with talent, but ultimately failed at the box office. Yet, it's structure was built around satirizing the superhero films that had been made up to that point, making it a meaningful addition to the culture soup. Today, it's safe to say that the worst thing about Mystery Men is that it came out about 20 years too soon, because it had a lot to say about heroes, villains, and ensemble super films.

WHAS has nothing to add, nothing to say. It's like Masked Singer - you watch because the people in it are famous, not because it has something to say."
Wet Hot American Summer,It really is quite funny.
Wet Hot American Summer,No
Wet Hot American Summer,Higher and Higher slaps way harder than it needed too.
Wet Hot American Summer,That’s insanely awesome that your cousin is Eric!!
Wet Hot American Summer,Craig Wedren was my hero in high school. You can tell him that.
Wet Hot American Summer,I was obsessed with higher and higher. Had it on repeat for weeks back in the day.
Wet Hot American Summer,[deleted]
Wet Hot American Summer,I'll never forget my comedy awakening by watching Stella. What a crazy crazy crazy show.
Wet Hot American Summer,[deleted]
Wet Hot American Summer,Stella was the funniest thing I had seen when it was new.  I should rewatch
Wet Hot American Summer,I'm still nervous to watch 10 Years Later because the trailer looks....not good
Wet Hot American Summer,"Burning Love is so great. Last I saw, it was streaming free on Pluto TV if anyone wants to check it out."
Wet Hot American Summer,"Victor, do you think he knew it was you victor? Do you victor!?"
Wet Hot American Summer,"Tammy Faye was really, really good. Shame it came out when it did when movies aren’t really featured like television is currently. Garfield was awesome in that too."
Wet Hot American Summer,"For real. Almost every single thing is so good, even the smaller things. Like the slow foot chase between Coop and the kid in episode 1 of FDOC or Bruce Greenwood talking on a smart phone."
Wet Hot American Summer,"Sometimes it's fun to get away from the culture soup, even for an hour."
Wet Hot American Summer,Is this some sort of copypasta I'm unfamiliar with?

Wet Hot American Summer,[deleted]
Wet Hot American Summer,I just heard Showalter on a podcast say that he hates the Pizza sketch. Which bums me out because I think it’s one of the funniest ever
Wet Hot American Summer,"> one of the most disappointing casualties of the 2007-08 Writers Strike was The State reunion movie

Surely they would have written this themselves, right?"
Wet Hot American Summer,Did The State have that skit where they were hunting muppets? I think that was just about the hardest I laughed at a skit in my life.
Wet Hot American Summer,"Did you watch their COVID reunion? They did Zoom versions of “Porcupine Racetrack” and “The Jew, the Italian, and the Red Head Gay.”"
Wet Hot American Summer,We...don't have...this...money
Wet Hot American Summer,"No it’s a rant. 

In my opinion WHAS is basically Movie 43, except the latter was raked over the coals for such a talented cast being in such a pointless film. WHAS avoided that level of scrutiny because it’s cast was largely unknown at the time of release."
Wet Hot American Summer,He’s Chris pines character who performs the song bad joke sorry lol

Wet Hot American Summer,Ohhh! Yes. He also wrote “I Am A Wolf”. There’s a nice recording of him doing it on his SoundCloud. Paul Rudd actually went as my cousin for Halloween once in the 90s… 😅

I can't even wait for this, I'll give husband a second chance to like it or I'm moving on. 20years and three kids are no reason to stay with someone who can't get behind this series."
Wet Hot American Summer,I will watching anything Stella-produced for the rest of my life.  This looks amazing.

Wet Hot American Summer,"Im really surprised Paul Rudd has the time for this show.  Dude is busy as shit right now with two Avengers and Antman & Wasp.  
  
Edit : It just dawned on me, Paul Rudd, RDJ and Chris Pratt are all going to be in the same movie and quite possibly the same scene.  Can the world handle that much sarcasm? "
Wet Hot American Summer,"Rad, the prequel-series is so boss and the movie is killer; super siked for the wigs, mostly. Cowabunga. '91."
Wet Hot American Summer,This is going to be amazing. I laughed so out loud at the trailer a few times. Is this going to be another season of episodes or a movie?
Wet Hot American Summer,"This could be 10 episodes of Alan Shemper telling terrible jokes while the whole cast over reacts and I would probably watch.
"
Wet Hot American Summer,I would like to watch this program when it airs
Wet Hot American Summer,I hope the zoot suit makes an appearance.
Wet Hot American Summer,"I like that this show added the actors that I do not expect in the first place like Alysa Milano and Jai Courtney.

I hope that Amy Poehler and Adam Scott shared a scene together. "

Olympus,Where do you get that title from what was written? It says that airing the trailer could result in FCC fines based on the fact that the trailer for Olympus Has Fallen contains actual EAS tones. It mentions nothing about it causing equipment to broadcast a false alarm.
Olympus,"I'm an MCO at a TV station. Never heard of EAS equipment reacting to tones from a spot on air. The box isn't even capable of 'hearing' the tones in that manner. It requires a complete signal from an authorized source such as the Weather Service or state government. 

The real reason for the concern is panicking stupid viewers who can't tell the difference between reality and movie trailers. "
Olympus,I work with an engineer at a TV station. This is the concern. 
Olympus,"Could it be A.D, if so its the sequal to the show 'the bible'."
Olympus,"I don't think so. I saw something to do with the arena. I wanna say the title was something like ""The doves of...."" but I can't find anything related. "
Olympus,"The Dovekeepers is an upcoming miniseries on CBS. I think it takes place in Israel during the Roman Empire. It's based on a novel. Looks interesting.

http://www.cbs.com/shows/the-dovekeepers/"
Olympus,"is it currently out, upcoming?"
Olympus,olympus on syfy?
Olympus,Thank you so much!
Olympus,"While that show looks awesome, it wasn't it. Olympus is Greek while whatever it was I saw is Roman. "
Olympus,"hmm, i checked http://www.pogdesign.co.uk/cat/ for any upcoming shows until august and i couldnt see anything to the likes of 'the doves of' or any roman time shows. but im not sure how full that website is, it doesnt seem to have many of the lesser known channels."
Olympus,I can't seem to find anything either. I know it was on a major network however. But it's starting to feel like I imagined it. 
Olympus,Well i hope you find what your looking for :)
Olympus,"I believe that they are legally required to keep things on the up and up. I think the editing makes a big difference in how matches are perceived. I think that each Titans training is different based on their professional backgrounds, which leads to difficulties in different parts of Mount Olympus. I personally think the Ninja's this season haven't been that good, but I think they try their hardest to win."
Olympus,Tyron Woodley wrestling for 25 minutes straight is a bit of an exaggeration. He got dominated in his last 2 fights and got tired almost immediately in both of them. He's got bad cardio.
Olympus,Is it doesn’t seem Authentic it probably isn’t
Olympus,"I don’t think it’s scripted but it falls into an new trope that it feels like most NBC game shows and reality series do which is to try to make it too cinematic. The climax moment or the celebration turns to slow motion with the same generic theme playing. Titan Games does it, so does the Wall and America’s Got Talent. Overall, not a fan"
Olympus,"Hannah Teeter should've done better then. 

Some people just do better than others."
Olympus,Someone please pitch this to Netflix 
Olympus,"Sure.  Maybe they could actually cast age appropriate actors, too."
Olympus,As long as it doesn't turn out like Shadowhunters.
Olympus,There was some chatter a while back that it would be a CW show.  Which would be a good fit too.  
Olympus,Yes. Reboot all the things.
Olympus,I'd love that. Not sure if you'd even need a full season for each book tbh.
Olympus,"My only request would for it to be animated. I loved the books and would love to see a faithful adaptation, but some of the crazier stuff in the books I feel wouldn't translate as well in live-action as they would in animation. Still, if they did it right and kept certain people away from the project *cough*Guggenheim*cough* then I'd be all for it"
Olympus,"I'd love to see a good adaptation, but that would definitely not mean a season per book, unless they were extremely short seasons. I would say they could do it in one or two seasons in the style of A Series of Unfortunate Events - two or three hour-long episodes per book would be completely sufficient."
Olympus,"An animated TV show, in the style of Voltron: Legendary Defender would be perfect, in my opinion. "
Olympus,"Na. You can absolutely do them as movies, just need to find the right people to do it. A series would be a real stretch imo."
Olympus,If the tv show was 4 episodes each then this would work
Olympus,An animated show would be amazing.
Olympus,I'd be fine if they animate it like Legend of Korra and Voltron.
Olympus,"don't think it needs 1 season per book.

Could cut it down to 3~. 

1/2 first season, 3/4 second, 5th final season.

And then they could do the kane chronicles"
Olympus,Yessss. A perfect netflix show.
Olympus,"I've had this exact idea for years. I've emailed every email I could find for Netflix people. I've also emailed Jeff Bezos about it. 

It would make a solid TV show on the right network. 

In my opinion itnwould either need to be Netflix, Amazon or The CW. "
Olympus,"I think it would probably be too expensive for a live-action show, so maybe an animated show? Something like Avatar: The Last Airbender."
Olympus,"I feel like it wouldn't work as 24 episodes, 12 episodes is best.
"
Olympus,We need to make this happen
Olympus,Yes to Netflix and fully animated in 2D so there would be no budget worries.
Olympus,I'd watch it
Olympus,"I've done that. I've emailed everyone I possible could. Even emailed Jeff Bezos at Amazon. 

I've wanted a Percy Jsckson TV show since I read the books. Itnwould make a great show...the only issue is finding a network for it. It's technically a kids book series and the main characters are 12-16 throughout the series but it also has a lot of violence and death. Finding a proper network is the issue. Netflix and Amazon would be perfect though. "
Olympus,"My first thought was, ""New Netflix series please"""
Olympus,Aging children into late teens is pretty standard in Hollywood and game of thrones shows why it is a good idea.  It makes production a hell of a lot better to have adults on set and it means you probably have a much better talent level.  The movies had many problems but the age of the characters was not one of them.
Olympus,[deleted]
Olympus,"This one really disappointed me. I wasn't expecting it to be that different from the source material. I knew the acting would be rough, first seasons on ABC family (freeform) have always been like that. Season 2 is a lot better though and I still watch it."
Olympus,"Everything on ABC family is cheesey as fuck, and not in a good way like The CW, or as I like to call them, Cheese Works."
Olympus,[deleted]
Olympus,Television/streaming is doing a better job than movies for adaptations. But that doesn't mean they'll always be good. Sooner or later one of them will be terrible.
Olympus,"10 episode seasons

would allow them to pace things better

and tighten the writing and plot"
Olympus,Guggenheim's wife will run it. She will run it just as well as she ran the Agent Carter show. Right into the ground. 
Olympus,"10-13 episode seasons. No need for the 23 episode seasons like some shows have. 

"
Olympus,"> fully animated in 2D so there would be no budget worries.

um 2d animation is very expensive if you want it to look not like total trash. "
Olympus,Hey if they could find kid actors for stranger things they could do the same here. It's definitely not impossible. 
Olympus,Also it avoids the pain in the ass of minor labor laws.
Olympus,"Logan was one of the few people who in my opinion were the right fit for the role, far older though he may have been. Literally everyone else was a miscast."
Olympus,Percy Jackson is supposed to be 12 in the first book so he was FAR too old.
Olympus,Still hoping they revive Constantine when Supernatural is done.
Olympus,Vampire Diaries is wrapping up it's last season.  That will free up some money for them.  Reign is also ending.  
Olympus,Shannara already happened man. 
Olympus,I think Lemony Snickets was done pretty well.
Olympus,Tv has the advantage of a hell of a lot more time to work with.  Movies are just about the shortest of the longform medias.
Olympus,"GoT already got terrible, unfortunately."
Olympus,"One Guggenheim has already run Percy Jackson into the ground, why not another?"
Olympus,"Even then. Let's say it's half an hour per episode at ten episodes a season. That's still five hours per book, which is way too much and you're going to end up with extra filler subplots or extremely decompressed storytelling, which wouldn't fit the series at all.

These are kid's books. None of them can sustain more than two or three hours' worth of story alone. Would it be cool to see multiple seasons, where the first covers all the books and the ones beyond that do their own thing with the world? Sure. The world is awesome. But asking for an entire 10-13 episode season per book, even at half an hour per episode, is just way too much."
Olympus,That is what I meant about production.
Olympus,I felt Percy and Luke were one of the few good casting decisions.
Olympus,[deleted]
Olympus,They aren't going to revive Constantine I don't think. They pushed it to their online thing called CW Seed as a cartoon. Same with the character Vixen from Arrow...dropped her completely and made a CW Seed show and now there is a completely different Vixen on Legends of Tomorrow. 
Olympus,Probably only cast salaries for TVD final. I imagine that TVD and Originals uses a lot of the same sets/pieces just dressed up differently since they both shoot in the Atlanta area.
Olympus,I'm trying to forget.
Olympus,Yeah Game of Thrones did that and no one cares. But at the same time it would be way too fucked up if they were the same ages as the book
Olympus,Completely disagree. Series of Unfortunate Events shows that you don't have to do that. 
Olympus,Actually the CW Seed Vixen show precedes her Arrow appearance. 
Olympus,[deleted]
Olympus,"And was a test to see how well a live-action show would do.  They opted to have her guest star on Arrow instead, and as noted then picked up a past Vixen for Legends.  Constantine animated show on CW Seed could be the same thing- a test for audiences, to see how well a revived live-action show would do."
Olympus,"...why are you saying that like it's a fact? Lol. 

"
Olympus,I'm thinking the same thing. 
Olympus,It just makes sense
Olympus,Why do you think so? 
Olympus,"I swear I remeber hearing the first epsiode that the weights for men and women were different. Specifically concerning the wall push up an incline and the pole raised. So I feel confident that the ball and chain are a lighter version, perhaps just made out of a less dense metal. "
Olympus,"My biggest complaint about the show is it’s just too simple.  You win one match and then you immediately go to mount Olympus. 

Best part of the season was in the first episode when the very buff chick dragged the concrete ball like it was nothing. "
Olympus,I’ve caught the end of it the last couple weeks and it is laughable when this huge ass dude struggles to pull that ball and then a girl comes up and just drags it across in like 5 seconds. 
Olympus,"They spend way too much time on the show talking about the back stories, this is the same reason I got tired of watching American Ninja Warrior. I love watching competitions on obstacle courses, but I seriously dont want to watch a show where more time is spent telling us about the competitors than is spent showing them competing (at least that how it feels on Titan Games). If theyd cut most of that fluff they could have run a whole extra event every episode and made it far more satisfying to at least half pay attention to


Edit: and I gotta agree with the other commenter saying the best moment so far was the first episode when lady came from so far behind and hauled ass with that ball like it was a bag of trash"
Olympus,Show seems fake as shit. From the 2 episodes I watched I saw a handful of laughable cliches where the one person had the other pushed all the way to the end about to win only to have them make some ridiculous comeback that didnt even make physical sense. 
Olympus,Whatever about the rest the last ep I watched said the final ball was 250 for the men and 200 for the women. 
Olympus,"well duh, all of it is scripted tv. it's far cheaper to make reality tv than a pocerderal. Why do you think almost all of the reality tv shows are around now, it's super cheap and they can make it look anyway they way. 

Look at even deadliest catch. it's the most non-scripted TV show and even it's scripted sometimes. 

The idea is to put out as many as possible of reality tv shows and see which ones are a hit and miss. if it's a miss, you don't have to worry about the people. if it's a hit, some become stars, but you don't have to pay star prices to them. "
Olympus,"Nope. They specifically say the weights, and they are all “the same”. 

Edit: I went back and watched the last episode. 

Men and women are all the same weights, wall - 1000lbs, gates of Olympus - 450lbs, crank for torch - 600lbs...
And the ball, you are correct was 250 for the men and 200 for the women. 

Either way, my point still remains. 

Edit 2: you get downvoted for admitting you were wrong. 
Piss off all you downvoters. "
Olympus,"Too simple and too little action. 
Plus, everyone has a sap story, which I’m kinda tired of. "
Olympus,"It's all about technique. The girls have all pulled the chain closer to the ball, versus most of the men fully extend the chain and pull that way. Also look how the chains are positioned. In a couple of the runs the way the chains are positioned at the base of the ball is creating extra friction making it harder to drag. "
Olympus,It’s the same ball too. 
Olympus,"Guess you've never heard of ""sandbagging"" in sports, then. It's a common strategy to let your opponent wear out first before powering back."
Olympus,"Although you didn’t really address what I was saying about the show, I hadn’t thought about your point of why there is so much reality tv before. Good point. "
Olympus,"Guess I was wrong for the other two, but isn't the height of the wall they have to go over also different? "
Olympus,I was thinking that too and it seems the girls do take some time to make sure they pull it right and the guys just grab and pull. 
Olympus,"You mean the 3 toward the end they leap over?

Those were all 5, 6, and 7 feet for each. "
Senora Acero,You can try asking Marcelo (Alberto Agnesi) on Instagram or Twitter. He's not super popular so you have a good shot on getting an answer.
The Wiggles,Do you think Glenn is coming back next season?
The Wiggles,I've always thought he looked a lot like Andrew Lincoln also. 
The Wiggles,So that guy from the wiggle is a 5* man 
The Wiggles,Depends if his pilot is picked up which it likely will be.
The Wiggles,"I literally have no idea. I can think of like eight different directions they're going with this. 

Either it's real, and there's a chance he's not coming back

It's a plot on the show, that will be played up for humor

Or anything in between. I really hope Glenn comes back"

The Wiggles,7 Days In Hell was like 2014 man
The Wiggles,I'm mad that he isn't even on the ballot.
The Wiggles,"That's his own fault though, actors submit themselves for consideration. Tim Allen forgot to submit his name in the 90s and the next year he had his paperwork delivered to the TV academy by the University of Southern California marching band. Candice Bergen never submitted again after winning 5 consecutive for Murphy Brown"

The Wiggles,"Thanks! That's awesome. I know the series isn't that old but for some reason I figured it would be simpler than that. I'd still like to find that behind the scenes footage though. As much as my wallet appreciates all the streaming options for TV these days, I miss having all those DVD extras."
The Wiggles,"Wow lol, thats great.  I always assumed they were cgi things pasted in later."
The Wiggles,"I thought of this, but I guess I figured since their make-up budget only covers a little nose-ridge or some leopard spots for 90% of the new species they encounter, I couldn't see them putting servos and radio controls on every Andorian character. "
The Wiggles,They don't have to do it on every andrioan character.  Just the ones that are being focused on. It can be reused for the characters through out the show.  
The Wiggles,"That makes sense. Even thinking in technical terms its hard to remember that everyone isn't in character, off doing their own thing in the show universe when not on-screen, haha."
Las munecas de la mafia,"2 of your major complaints have more to do with your inabilities than the show itself.

Your inability to read subtitles has nothing to do with the show. It's like an ESL person complaining there's too much subtitles to read when watching The Community.

Equally, your inability to distinguish between the women has nothing to do with the show. Granted, I couldn't tell couple of them apart as well in the beginning (but this happens a lot when I first start a show) but it didn't take long until I could tell them apart and they really don't look that similar.

&#x200B;

I did not get the sense that it promised us an adventurous girls trip. This seems to be an assumption you made then got fixated on? They are a bunch of girls who go on a vacation together; partying, doing drugs, walking around town, chilling on a boat etc, sound about right to me. This isn't some fantasy show where they go on to slay dragons.

Cancer and doing challenges with your best friends? To me it was obvious from the get go that it's a show about self-discoveries. But it really doesn't matter whether my assumption was correct or not because it has nothing to do with the quality of the show.

&#x200B;

I don't think it's even important to know who has cancer. The writer even told us this by showing us how the show could end if it is revealed that a specific character had cancer at the beginning of episode 6.  I would have been ok even if it remained vague. This isn't a mystery ""find the person with cancer!"" show where you go back and see what clues you've missed.

&#x200B;

edit: wording and grammar."
Las munecas de la mafia,Couldn’t have said it better myself
Las munecas de la mafia,"I agree completely. And to add: this is a VERY rare show that has moments that actually makes me ""real"" laugh (like I'm in on the joke and not laughing AT the characters), and had a great portrayal of friendships, and one of the LEAST fake drug experiences. I truly loved this. Even though I binge watch a lot on Netflix, I tend to play some game after a bit in background because there's a bit of irritation at taking too long to get to the point, but in this case I enjoyed the journey, and loved it. I also love that it didn't feel like anything else to me. 

I do admit two things though: one, that for first 2 episodes, I kept confusing the 2 married women, but it was easy to sort their faces as I got to know them better; and two, that i did very mildly try to guess which had cancer, and first thoughts were correct, but it thankfully really wasnt treated as a mystery or important to story. 

I think I'll rewatch in original Spanish versus the dubbing to better get idea of tones and voices of each woman."
Las munecas de la mafia,"Yes! The way I see it OP didn't get the show because they went in with completely different expectations. There is nothing to get or expect from it but just enjoy the time you have with the characters. Most of the time I just wanted to be there, sit next to them and talk about nothing and everything and that's the beauty of it. 

Though i do admit that 3 of the characters looked extremely alike with their head shaven but that is in no way a minus point and more of a fun observation."
Las munecas de la mafia,Im on episode 5 and the season it's hilarious the only thing im hating is that Ernesto storyline. It's worst and more predictable thing ever
Las munecas de la mafia,Wut
Las munecas de la mafia,Could in theory be good for AAA but they half ass everything so much and have half assed the Marvel collab stuff  in particular. Disney has practically begging to raise their platform and the best they've done is some 10 minute pre show matches that they barely put on TV.
Las munecas de la mafia,I need this so badly
Las munecas de la mafia,"First roadside assistance, then car insurance, and now TV shows? I hope I can watch this with my existing AAA membership."
Las munecas de la mafia,"I don't get it, it's a reality fight show or a scripted show?"
Las munecas de la mafia,Finally we begin the marketing lead up for everyone's most anticipated marvel legend *El Muerto*
Las munecas de la mafia,"Fucking hell, am I having a stroke?"
Las munecas de la mafia,"aaa is the biggest professional wrestling promotion in mexico, and it appears they are getting a tv/streaming show"
Las munecas de la mafia,"If the ""Lucha Underground vibe"" comment is accurate you expect a mix of both. The wrestling would be pretty traditional done in front of a live crowd sort of thing, but the outside the match stuff would appear much more like a scripted tv show likely with fantasy/comic elements for the characters and storylines."
Las munecas de la mafia,"They've been filming Marvel matches with Lucha-fied superhero gimmicks for a few years. They introduced a Marvel belt at Triplemania, but there is no telling what the storyline stuff will be like. I'm guessing it'll be Chikara meets Lucha Underground."
Las munecas de la mafia,Is it? Now I prefer AAA but I'm pretty sure CMLL is the biggest professional wrestling promotion in Mexico given its existed for 89 years.
Las munecas de la mafia,This looks a bit like a G rated Lucha Underground.
Las munecas de la mafia,Looks fun. The marvel inspired luchador costumes are pretty decent.
Las munecas de la mafia,"AAA has fumbled the bag so badly with the Marvel Lucha Libre stuff that I'm not expecting too much with this, I hope it works out but they've treated it like such an afterthought despite using some of the most famous characters on Earth."
Las munecas de la mafia,"I remember being so excited to watch Lucha Underground, but then I saw just how boring the wrestling part of it was. I’ll still check this out but I’m not expecting anything different."
Las munecas de la mafia,u/savevideobot
Las munecas de la mafia,Is this satire ? I can’t tell lol
Las munecas de la mafia,Bruh lucha underground was a GEM. It was either so blatantly fake that it was beyond hilarious or it was them actually smacking the living shit out of each other. Either way it was a spectacle to behold.
Las munecas de la mafia,Pretty sure I saw it somewhere described as trying to be Lucha Underground
Las munecas de la mafia,How can you find LU boring from a wrestling standpoint?
Las munecas de la mafia,I think I find all wrestling boring. Throwing someone to the ropes and doing moves which look weak just isn’t entertaining to me. I would rather watch a wrestling anime like Ultimate Muscle.
Las munecas de la mafia,"So then you don't like wrestling. That's ok as it's not for everyone. Lucha Underground had a hybrid comic book/telenovela style of presentation for their vignettes. Since it was taped and had a special studio for the wrestling, the in ring product was heavily edited and could seem a little disjointed at times but the action itself was great"

Las munecas de la mafia,"I wouldn't Call it a long string, it makes it sound like she's been in dozen akf movies with two good films when in reality she's been in 9, two of those (Rio andady and the Tramp) were VA roles that at worst are mediocre with another two to three being solid to great films. That's leaves 4 actually bad films. Not saying it's a miracle of proof or anything but that the way you frame it exaggerates how many flops she's atcually been in."

I'm not familiar with most of these, and I watch a shit-ton of TV and movies. I really like the effort, and the writeups are perfect in length.


Again, not knowing these a lot, is Severance the highest ranked English speaking show? (Nothing against non English speakers of course) 


Also, I'm guessing most of these are straight drama? Language and genre might both be useful things to put in parenthesis for anyone else unfamiliar.


Totally agree with the couple from White Lotus being great characters, I much preferred season 1 (which seems like a hot take) but those two, specifically the woman, were very interesting characters to me."

..................

I didn't like what 2022 television had to offer for the most part. One too many disappointments for me as well. I mean I watched a lot more shows than I did in 2021, yet struggled to find 25 new shows for this list. But I do think my top 13 here are genuinely great.But anyways, thanks a lot for reading, even if you just scrolled through this lol. Same time, same place, next year? ❤️"
El Cartel 2,"Neat list.  A lot of shows I've not seen.

A few shows from 2022 I'd recommend if you haven't seen em:

- Black Bird

- SAS Rogue Heroes

- The Offer

- Under the Banner of Heaven"
El Cartel 2,Recency bias but I just finished Yellowjackets and really had a great time watching it.
El Cartel 2,No Atlanta? Both seasons last year were incredible
El Cartel 2,Pachinko is the most slept on series of 2022
El Cartel 2,"1. She hulk
2. Ted lasso
3. Ms Marvel
4. Harley Quinn show
5. Lord of the rings
6. Spy x family 
7. Chainsaw man
8. Loki
9. Mob psycho
10. Hot D"
El Cartel 2,Which ones did you see? 🤔 amma take a wild guess and say The Bear and Severance?
El Cartel 2,"> is Severance the highest ranked English speaking show?

Yes. Even though Pachinko got a bit of english too. 

> I'm guessing most of these are straight drama? Language and genre might both be useful things to put in parenthesis for anyone else unfamiliar.

Yea. And yea I should probably do that next time."
El Cartel 2,"i just read the synopsis and glance at the preview a bit sometimes just to check visual/production quality. if it looks like something that could be potentially great, i check it out."
El Cartel 2,🙂💕
El Cartel 2,It’s great but it’s depressing.
El Cartel 2,"What other new anime from 2022 did you think were great? 

Anime for me in 2022 was, *meh* tbh. I didn't like Summertime Rendering much and Chainsaw Man hasn't gotten to the good parts of the manga yet. I was suppose to see Bocchi The Rock! before making this list, but ended up getting an ear infection so couldn't."
El Cartel 2,I'd count Yellowjackets as 2021 TV show.
El Cartel 2,on the other version of this list pinned on my profile.
El Cartel 2,"Nice! Do you often give the pilot a go before fully committed to the whole season? Any shows that you have given up midpoint? 


Like I tried to start Warrior Nun because the trailer seems fun and the lead actress looks very beautiful, also being afraid of it being cancelled (it indeed got cancelled then), but have given up after episode 6 or 7… cause the plot is very weak and the characters are laughable.


And then I tried to pick the ones that got high ratings in imdb, and started watching Extraordinary Attorney Woo and I do like it so far! Although sometimes being too cheesy at times, the acting is excellent and the stories are well-written. Highly recommended."
El Cartel 2,"Dropped Summertime after 5 minutes lol.

But personally, Bocchi the Rock is incredible TV and is my #1 show of any medium this year. And I'm not even usually into anime comedies. It's just that good, glad you're gonna try it! I'm an Attack on Titan fan after the massive story shift in Season 3, and S4P2 aired at the start of the year, although personally I don't like rating something that isn't an entire season.

Otherwise Chainsaw Man would be a decent pick even if, as you said, it hasn't quite gotten to what makes it special yet. Cyberpunk Edgerunners is one that would be worth watching and has near universal praise, and my other 2 shows to hit a 9 were Kaguya S3 (but it's not everyone), and Paripi Koumei, which I thought was an extremely passionate show but it might hit as a 7-8 for others. 

From your list I probably have to watch the 2 seasons of Tatami though. I had no idea it was well regarded I never looked into it!

Other than that though, yea there was a lot of meh. Spy Family went from potentially great to just average as it went on, LycoRyco got a lot of hype but was merely good not great (needed some writing cleanup). Personally though Dress up Darling was ok at best, and Gundam and To Your Eternity were massive disappointments"
El Cartel 2,Ignoring some great sequels I thought Chainsaw man was awesome even if it hadn't gotten to some of the good parts  of the manga. And I really liked summertime rendering (although I haven't seen the last few episodes). Lycoris recoil was fun. Spy X Family was great.
El Cartel 2,Oh my bad. I’m late to the party.
El Cartel 2,"> Do you often give the pilot a go before fully committed to the whole season?

I give everything at least 4 episodes before I decided whether it's working for me or not. Unless it's *reeeeeeeaaaaally* bad... then I quit after the 2nd or 3rd. But that rarely happens. That has only happened like 4 times in the past 3 years. 

> Any shows that you have given up midpoint?

A shit ton. 

> Extraordinary Attorney

I was suppose to watch this show too but unfortunately didn't have time for it. There are some great shows coming out of korea nowadays (3 are on this list too lol), but they require commitment with those lengthy episode counts and runtime. 

I recommend ""**D.P.**"" on netflix too if you haven't seen it. That's another outstanding one."
El Cartel 2,"> Bocchi the Rock is incredible TV and is my #1 show of any medium this year. And I'm not even usually into anime comedies. It's just that good

damn. guess i gotta hurry and check this one out now. lol."
El Cartel 2,"You should check out Kotaro Lives Alone, such a good show!"
El Cartel 2,"Heard good reviews about DP but I haven’t managed to watch it, with season 2 coming this year I may watch it soon!

For other Korean shows I watched My Name, Hellbound and of course Squid Game in 2021, which were all very good. Narco-Saints, The Glory and Somebody are shows I saved in 2022 but not started yet."
El Cartel 2,I did hear about it! I'll add it to my list thanks!
NCIS,Hoping the edits for Survivor improve. The last three winners being so under the radar was difficult to connect the dots. I was told rather than shown what happened in the finale.
NCIS,"The list:


CSI: Vegas

NCIS

NCIS: Hawai'i

Amazing Race

Lingo

Survivor

Tough As Nails

48 Hours

60 Minutes"
NCIS,Amazing Race too! Hooray!
NCIS,Is that Bill fucking Lumbergh?
NCIS,"Ghosts has been such a delightful show on CBS, happy to see it get a renewal!"
NCIS,48 hours and 60 minutes need to be renewed? I never thought of them as seasoned shows. But more as a news style programs that are year round.
NCIS,I hope Blue Bloods gets renewed!
NCIS,We feast today! - *the over 50 crowd*
NCIS,"Not sure what is sadder, that NCIS:LA is ending or the writing in last few seasons."
NCIS,I feel like nobody watches Tough as Nails but it somehow keeps getting renewed.
NCIS,[deleted]
NCIS,"Execs keep phoning it in with their cash cows, as well as the cast, crew, and writers of this neverending garbage."
NCIS,[deleted]
NCIS,"I also wish they brought back the ""Last week on Survivor"" opening. I found these were really helpful to be reminded of the machinations.

And please, get rid of the sob stories, I'm watching Survivor, not American Idol."
NCIS,the last couple winners have just annoyed me not even for their edits but just annoyed me on the show
NCIS,Disagree on the most recent season. He/She pretty much told us every week they were in the perfect position to win and was making all kinds of deals. We just didn’t believe him/her.
NCIS,"For as ass as Big Brother US is, this is why I like BBUS and BBCan to a lesser extent, there’s live feeds so we can see what happened behind the scenes

I think this is why I just can not get into an other reality show except for The Traitors cause it’s in the similar vein without the live feeds"
NCIS,Have you watched Survivor South Africa? The one season I watched was amazing.
NCIS,"Which leaves the following up in the air at CBS still:

Blue Bloods Season 14  
East New York Season 2  
S.W.A.T. Season 7  
True Lies Season 2"
NCIS,And people wonder why cable cutting is so popular
NCIS,[deleted]
NCIS,"Hoping they can start flying commercial again, it’s been a little bland without the travel booking drama"
NCIS,"Yes, he replaced Gibbs on NCIS. Also another role he's known for is the main bad guy in Pineapple Express."
NCIS,I love him on the Good Fight. Makes a very likable human being... and Republican
NCIS,I keep meaning to check it out
NCIS,"I'm surprised it hasn't, it seems to be doing pretty well ratings-wise. I wonder if any contracts are up for renegotiating."
NCIS,Meanwhile the children are crying that their shows get canceled.
NCIS,"I watch it, my favorite CBS show, less sob stories than survivor, more challenges. Still too many sob stories for my tastes. It seems like a pretty cheap to produce show as well"
NCIS,this guy hasn’t met any parents
NCIS,let me introduce you to the magical world of viewership
NCIS,"Yeah. I'm not digging the slant on personal/sad stories with the flashbacks with photos myself. That's why I stopped watching ANW. It's hard to avoid casting superfans though given how long Survivor has been airing but I do think we've gotten some average/relatable cast but probably not enough to my liking. But I'm also a stubborn Millennial and think Influencer isn't a job (someone on the upcoming season is one lol). I'd like casting to be more grounded and less, pretty people.

And then there's the loss of days on Fiji and then never leaving, no more auction...a back to basics would be refreshing after so many twists/advantages."
NCIS,"There's a big emphasis on 'big moves' and 'padding your resume' these days, like it's almost become the *'only*' way to win"
NCIS,Or America's Got Talent
NCIS,"I don't mind the winner or their strategy, just that I'd rather see the behind the scenes, rather than them saying as much. I'd love more concrete foreshadowing but I think once I rewatch, it might look less muddy."
NCIS,"It was pretty rare to not have an idea where the player stood and whom they were aligning with consistently. Maybe not an outstanding performance as a player, but you have an idea on how they could convince a jury."
NCIS,No but I have heard good things. Same with AUS Survivor but finding a way to watch it has been a little tough for me. My Google skills are lacking haha.
NCIS,True Lies hasn't aired yet.
NCIS,My dad loves East New York. Will be bummed to tell him if it gets canceled
NCIS,Blue Bloods will never be cancelled. East New York would have already been cancelled on any other network.
NCIS,"They've also renewed Fire Country, Young Sheldon, Ghosts, The Neighborhood, Bob Hearts Abishola, So Help Me Todd, The Equalizer, FBI, FBI: International, and FBI: Most Wanted"
NCIS,"You say this as if streaming services aren’t just as if not more prone to cancelling shows.

Eyes the 20+ cancellations in the past 3 months from streaming alone."
NCIS,Big Brother was renewed for season 25 at the end of season 24.
NCIS,"As long as they keep all the self driving too. Taxis are a dice roll, self driving actually seperates the teams with navigation skills."
NCIS,The most recently filmed one (35) is still using the charter.  36 is likely to resume commercial.
NCIS,Travel booking drama rarely happens in the later seasons regardless.
NCIS,"Hasn't been as dramatic since they removed a lot of the independent travel dynamics years ago. The BBC did a much better version (Race Across the World), which I absolutely love because it takes the race and makes it the essential part - and not the challenges along the way."
NCIS,"He has really, really made the role his own. They are even building his backstory out more this season.

It's a smoothly run machine again."
NCIS,Does he make them all file TPS reports?
NCIS,"Me too, I loved him on the Good Wife but hated how they ended it."
NCIS,"If you get the chance it's worth it, such a sincere show with a lot of fun characters, and even more heart!"
NCIS,"Maybe watch a few commercials now and again, Zoomers!"
NCIS,[deleted]
NCIS,"I think “hiding in plain site” is just the current winning strategy with so many super fans trying to impress the podcasts and twitter with their big, loud strategy. I don’t think the edit is hiding much because those three winners didn’t even start playing until post merge. 

Lovely discussion, friend."
NCIS,The Survivor youtube channel had some seasons during the missed Covid season. I'm not sure if they're still there.
NCIS,But what about MILF Island?
NCIS,I’m not commenting on what’s being cancelled.
NCIS,Agreed that can stay
NCIS,Depends on the location. There's places that work better with cabs like London or New York.
NCIS,I doubt they ever go back to commercial again
NCIS,They address that on Good Fight. He's still with Diane.
NCIS,"it's like a reverse psychology thing, when someone does a 'big move' everyone is like 'OMG, they're padding their resume by claiming the credit for a big move' and so, become a target

One is feeding the other, for sure

There still feels like a bunch of talk on the juries about who did this move and who did that one though, imo"
NCIS,You make a good point there! I'm still hoping we get to see more of the deals or a better indication. I don't want to have to read exit interviews to get a clear picture. But maybe the next season will be different!
NCIS,Phil and production have been suggesting otherwise.
NCIS,"Odds on them cobbling together another NCIS spin-off to replace it, the way Hawaii replaced New Orleans?"
NCIS,All these NCIS' make it sound like joining the Navy is a death sentence. If you don't commit murder someone will murder you.
NCIS,I imagine a lot of the cast was ready to leave. The main 4 have been doing it since season 1(with one joining late in the season). In a hypothetical season 16 I could see all of them gone due the actor wanting out. The original NCIS was able to space out departures much better. It kinda funny but if the show had been less successful at retaining cast members it might have been able to continue.
NCIS,"Not surprising given how checked out the cast is. There has only been 1 I think episode this season where every cast member was in it. They rotate an episode off, but it def seems like LL Cool J and Chris O’Donnell are out the most. It’s annoying how obvious it’s been for like 3-4+ seasons that it’s just a cash grab-they are probably making a ridiculous amount of money. 

I’m enjoying the new Hawaii leg of the franchise. It’s much fresher and I like the cast."
NCIS,INB4: NCIS Hawaii CSI Mcguyver 5-0
NCIS,"Awh damn, I love this show. Time for a rewatch from season 1."
NCIS,"Kind of a big shock, even bigger than them canceling Magnum PI last year."
NCIS,Who's going to break the news to grandma?
NCIS,For some reason this is the only NCIS I haven't watched but after the crossover episodes last week I finally started watching it and it's not too bad.
NCIS,"as a nobody actor it is my dream to just get a recurring role on one of these shows that nobody really watches but lasts like 15 years

I still regret not going ti work on the walking dead. turned into a 20 yr gig for some of my friends (here in Ga)"
NCIS,14 seasons is a great run- I honestly thought that it was going to end sooner.
NCIS,Just in time for Chris O’Donnell to star as Robert Pattinson’s Robin in The Batman 2!
NCIS,"This show is still on! The LL Cool J and Chris O'Donnell one? Wow, I thought it was one of the CSI spin-offs that fizzled out."
NCIS,It'll be replaced with more police/military procedurals or a new fire fighting show.
NCIS,My mom is going to be so disappointed.
NCIS,My favourite NCIS
NCIS,I'd like a show that follows actual NCIS crimes instead of terrorism and murder durder.
NCIS,Should have ended like 12 seasons ago.
NCIS,"Damn- my great, great, great grandmother is going to take this really hard…"
NCIS,Why is nathan drake standing on the left?
NCIS,Look at those empty plate carriers
NCIS,Why do all of these people look like posers?
NCIS,"Thank goodness because the episode I just watched was so abysmally atrocious it was beyond comprehension. I mean, it was NCIS in name-only because they always did more spy / espionage / terrorist stuff than any actual Naval Criminal Investigative stuff. But “Best Seller” — totally horrendous."
NCIS,Who watches these low bro shows?
NCIS,I went 14 years not watching this. Was hoping to make it an even 15.
NCIS,Who?
NCIS,Is there a place where one can stream NCIS Los Angeles (older seasons and not just current or last season) and not have to pay by the episode or for the season (e.g. like a Netflix or a Paramount Plus)?   I’m on Season 14 of the original NCIS on Netflix and cannot find NCIS Los Angeles (whole) anywhere.  Plan was to start that next.
NCIS,Why do they all look like discount Delta Force?
NCIS,I need someone with a lot of time on their hands to do a total body count for this show.  How many kills did the team make in the 14 years?  I’d guess it’s in the thousands.
NCIS,Does this mean no more navy-related crime in LA?
NCIS,Not bad for a show set in a city with little to no NCIS personnel.
NCIS,Not surprised since they never even bothered to pair it up with the other NCIS shows to create a NCIS Monday block.
NCIS,NCIS: Gary Indiana
NCIS,there's  Sydney Australia  one that's supposed to come out sometime this year
NCIS,"unclear. honestly, a big impetus for hawaii was because CBS has a standing production setup in hawaii dating back to the original hawaii five 0 that has resulted in them near constantly looking for cost savings by reusing it with new shows. they axed the reboot 5-0 and almost immediately there was an ""NCIS: pearl harbor"" pilot script making the rounds.

that being said i hope they keep going cause eventually theyll run out of major port cities."
NCIS,"I didn't know that New Orleans was over, does that mean that Captain Archer has a clear schedule?"
NCIS,"Navy petty officer vs starfleet ensign, neither for the faint of heart."
The Day My Butt Went Psycho!,"I'd like to reiterate, fuck Caillou."
The Day My Butt Went Psycho!,here's a [good read on Total Drama Island](https://www.reddit.com/r/HobbyDrama/comments/uptttz/animation_the_tragedy_of_total_drama_reunion_how/) from the r/HobbyDrama subreddit
The Day My Butt Went Psycho!,This was a great read.
The Day My Butt Went Psycho!,"That was quite the word vomit, and I remember Teletoon fondly as a kid watching it on weekends during sleepovers at friends places. How are you going to write all that and not mention some greats like:

-	Roughnecks (Animated Starship Troopers)
-	The Oblongs
-	Undergrads
-	Mission Hill
-	The Critic
-	Tripping the Rift

And some weirder ones like Home Movies, Quads!, and god knows what else I can’t quite remember. I do recall Cybersix being a little over my head as a kid though and thought the main character was actually a dude for awhile lol.

Edit - I also rewatched the entirety of Roughnecks recently and it actually holds up pretty damn well. The voice acting is done well, and even though the CGI is from that era, it was really well done. I had never seen it all the way through when I was younger due to missing episodes and their infamously bad release schedule, but it was well worth the time to watch. The last season got cut short and it could have ended more cleanly, but I still enjoyed it thoroughly even after all these years."
The Day My Butt Went Psycho!,"I was there for the silver age. 

I really liked Delilah and Julius. 

And one I didn't see mentioned later on was Detentionaire. Came in 2011-2015 and was pretty good."
The Day My Butt Went Psycho!,"I remember watching Undergrads and Clone high on Teletoon, you mentioned so many shows I totally forgot about....What a loss, but it was time."
The Day My Butt Went Psycho!,Teletoon was such a big part of my childhood. I used to watch scooby doo every day after school.
The Day My Butt Went Psycho!,Neds newt was the shit. You missed Dragon Ball
The Day My Butt Went Psycho!,"Omg I forgot about Megababies. The theme song immediately started playing in my head. I LOVED Braceface and For Better Or For Worse! Ugh I grew up on Teletoon, from the mid/late nineties till about 2004. This post was so nostalgic."
The Day My Butt Went Psycho!,"This post was a huge nostalgia trip for myself. Just thinking back there are so many shows that I enjoyed that actually were Teletoon originals and I just didn't realize it - it's kind of amazing! Teletoon circa 2005 through 2009 was my favourite period, mostly because of all the cool action-adventure shows that premiered in that time. I loved watching Chaotic, Bakugan, Spider Riders, Atomic Betty, and Skyland. I did also enjoy 6teen, the first season of Total Drama Island, and Johnny Test, but I never watched them consistently. From their earlier blocks, I will always have a soft spot for The Tofus, What About Mimi, What's with Andy (though admittedly I mostly watched the Romanian dub for this), Rescue Heroes, Maggie and the Ferocious Beast, The Kids from Room 402 (mostly the Romanian dub again)...and the theme song from Flying Rhino Junior High will still occasionally get stuck in my head :P 

I just hope that all these shows will be made more accessible for more folks to enjoy in future and not get put into an inconspicuous vault/removed from streaming without warning."
The Day My Butt Went Psycho!,I just bought the entire Redwall book series. 20+ books. Hoping it gets another shot at the screen because it's prime for adaptation imo
The Day My Butt Went Psycho!,"I grew up in Quebec and teletoon was my childhood. I remember it had the best animated series out there even before series that had continuity(not episodic) was a thing. Redwall, silvering and toad patrol were amazing."
The Day My Butt Went Psycho!,"My parents didnt want to get more than the basic tv package, we didnt have the Teletoon channels, much to my chagrin.

Channel 44 for us, I think that was the french version.

We had to make do with VrakTv (25) and YTV (70?)."
The Day My Butt Went Psycho!,Anyone remember Untalkative Bunny? That's the first thing that comes to mind when I think of Teletoon
The Day My Butt Went Psycho!,"Man I thought I was the only one who remembered Mega Babies.

Also shout out to weeknights from 8-9pm when The Bugs Bunny and Tweety Show was on."
The Day My Butt Went Psycho!,Delta state was the shit!
The Day My Butt Went Psycho!,"Don't forget Clone High! The late night era with Undergrads, Oblongs, Mission hill and Clone High was the best."
The Day My Butt Went Psycho!,Dragon Ball was on YTV
The Day My Butt Went Psycho!,I knew I was forgetting one. Clone High was amazing.
The Day My Butt Went Psycho!,It was on both actually
The Day My Butt Went Psycho!,I seem to remember Sons of Butcher playing in that era with those shows but that might’ve been YTV
The Day My Butt Went Psycho!,"Ah, I see now. They aired 13 episodes in 1997. So yeah you're *technically* correct, but I think most Canadian kids who grew up in that era would remember it as a YTV show."
The Day My Butt Went Psycho!,Saw that too and I swear they had more than 14 episodes. It was a long time ago so who knows
The Day My Butt Went Psycho!,"I've watched the premiere.  One thing that stuck out to me is when Lori's mom and others remark, ""she changed when she met Chad.""

No, she didn't.  She was always nuts!  Anyone who claims to speak to Jesus or Angels or anyone else who is not present clearly has a screw loose."
The Day My Butt Went Psycho!,"For those who didn’t read the article:

The story is told from the son’s point of view, he is portrayed as sympathetic and a loving husband and father. Son just got arrested for domestic abuse. Makes it awkward how he is portrayed in the documentary."
The Day My Butt Went Psycho!,Like it says in the article it doesn't change anything and to be honest I don't think the documentaries about sympathy for him as it is just telling the story of this insane family which is obviously still insane. Him getting arrested reinforces this documentary in a way that this family needs to be locked away.
The Day My Butt Went Psycho!,"Excerpt:

>Latter-day Saint ties


>Very little of what happens is directly tied to Utah, but a lot of it is tied to the fact that both Lori and Chad Daybell were members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Chad served a mission to New Jersey, where he “set all sorts of baptismal records,” another returned missionary says in the documentary.


>Chad is a graduate of Brigham Young University; he, Tammy and their children lived in Springville before moving to Rexburgh, Idaho; Tammy is buried in Springville, which is where her body was exhumed during the investigation into her death.


>“I raised all our kids in the LDS Church,” Lori’s mother says in the documentary. “All of our kids loved the Book of Mormon, and Lori’s always loved the scriptures.”


>And Ryan says, “As time went on, the LDS Church was becoming a bigger topic in our house. I think it started to become a little bit more of idolatry. There was just pictures everywhere. Everything was getting replaced slowly with pictures of temples and stuff like that. All over the house — all over everything.”


>“Sins of Our Mother” outlines how both Lori and Chad Daybell moved far from their Latter-day Saint upbringings. Chad thinks he’s a prophet. He and his followers think reincarnation is a thing, and he was awaiting an apocalypse, when only 144,000 righteous people would survive. And he would lead them.


>“He’s trying to create a new religion on the back of Mormonism,” says forensic psychologist John Mathias.


>There are references that only those familiar with the church will understand, like when Charles texts about “Gadiantons” — seemingly drawn from the Gadianton robbers in the Book of Mormon.


>And there are audio recordings of Lori recounting religious experiences that are … odd. Dead people, angels — including the angel Moroni — and God talking to her. She and Chad believed they had been married to each other multiple times in previous lives.


>Lori is convinced that Chad is indeed a prophet. She believed that her ex-husband, Charles Daybell, and both Tylee and JJ had become “zombies” — evil spirits took over their bodies, and they had to be killed to free their spirits.


>“I mean, look, it’s completely off the wall,” Borgman said. “But, we’ve all seen stories or known people who sort of just go too far in their beliefs. I mean, usually it doesn’t end up with the murder of your children.”"
The Day My Butt Went Psycho!,just rename it Sins of our Mother and One of her Sons and voilà
The Day My Butt Went Psycho!,The Mormons brought us Jody Arias too.  Hat's off to Joseph Smith
The Day My Butt Went Psycho!,Is it still a good documentary? Despite being “awkward”? The case is fascinating
The Day My Butt Went Psycho!,I grew up in Utah. Fuck that cult and all the damage I’ve seen first hand it’s responsible for.
The Day My Butt Went Psycho!,Grandma is reprehensible too.
The Day My Butt Went Psycho!,I read that the charges have been dropped already btw
The Day My Butt Went Psycho!,Colby seemEd to be as fake and fame hungry as his crazy mom. I wondered why always let Lori off easy when he was one of the few in contact with her.
The Day My Butt Went Psycho!,His charges were dropped 2 days ago
The Day My Butt Went Psycho!,I literally just finished the show and was looking for somewhere on Reddit to comment how strangely cold and disconnected the son seemed from these traumatizing events. I was trying to tell myself everyone grieves differently but it just seemed off to me. Lo and behold
The Day My Butt Went Psycho!,LDS is illegitimate!
The Day My Butt Went Psycho!,"Why are there so many Mormons involved in murder? This case, the Susan Cox Powell case, etc"
The Day My Butt Went Psycho!,"The charges against Colby Ryan were dropped and court appearances cancelled on Sept 6. Apparently, it was his estranged wife. [https://www.deseret.com/u-s-world/2022/9/12/23349124/sins-of-our-mother-colby-ryan-charges-dropped](https://www.deseret.com/u-s-world/2022/9/12/23349124/sins-of-our-mother-colby-ryan-charges-dropped)"
The Day My Butt Went Psycho!,"I do not think that she was a ""faithful"" good member of that cult ever...she was always nasty, hypocritical and shallow"
The Day My Butt Went Psycho!,Agree. She accused her 3rd husband Joe Ryan of sexually assaulting Ryan & Tylee because she wanted full custody even had her now deceased brother Al taser Joe in a parking lot after a custody hearing. Lori told a social worker she wld kill Joe if he got shared custody. Even falsely told 4th husband Charles lies about Joe hoping to get full custody of Tylee. Charles spent thousands on court case fighting custody. Later found out was all a lie. Social workers police did a thorough investigation into allegations and concluded it was obvious Lori coached both kids as to what to say about Joe. Btw Joe is Tylee's bio Dad. Ryan still claims Joe sexually assaulted him since Lori was arrested. Seems to add to it  each time in paid interviews.
The Day My Butt Went Psycho!,"So a guy who lived with some reprehensible woman as a mother grew up to be a domestic abuser?

*Shocking.*"
The Day My Butt Went Psycho!,He also has a rape charge. There is verbal evidence to his admission of doing so on a recorded phone conversation… i thought he was a loving married man?!
The Day My Butt Went Psycho!,"Are you serious. I felt something was off with him and his wife, but I couldn’t put my finger on it."
The Day My Butt Went Psycho!,Damn….
The Day My Butt Went Psycho!,"Agreed with this guy. It doesn’t taint his image within the documentary, it just goes to show that these people are messed tf up and need help"
The Day My Butt Went Psycho!,"I haven't read the article, but this excerpt doesn't really explain why the documentary is now awkward with the arrest of her adult son. Why is it awkward?"
The Day My Butt Went Psycho!,"Her ex-husband Charles “daybell”. Gross!!! 
🤢🤮🤢🤮I’m sure it’s honest mistake."
The Day My Butt Went Psycho!,"May I reccomend Neil LaBute (a former LDS member) excellent play ""BASH"" 
It is a three part play about the intolerance of some members of the LDS 
It is available in paperback and I got a VHS copy of it, I do not know if it made it to DVD or YouTube.
Neil LaBute was expelled from the church because of it."

The Day My Butt Went Psycho!,I see what you did there
The Day My Butt Went Psycho!,Jody Arias only joined the church because Travis was Morman
The Day My Butt Went Psycho!,And Josh Powell.
The Day My Butt Went Psycho!,I don’t think we can blame them for Arias since she only “converted” to get Travis Alexander to marry her. She wasn’t raised Mormon and wasn’t even close to living or subscribing to the lifestyle.
The Day My Butt Went Psycho!,So Joseph Smith brought us Jody Arias’ asshole?
The Day My Butt Went Psycho!,"The LDS has the rare distinction to share 1st Prize ex-aqueo with Jehovas Witness as the MOST INTOLERANT Christian cults.
Evangelists and Lutherans are among the tolerant top. Catholics too, but boy, their church has a nasty past...."
The Day My Butt Went Psycho!,Keith Morrison better narrate or I’m out.
The Day My Butt Went Psycho!,I watched it just now and thought it was very informative. Then came here and wondered why they left so much out
The Day My Butt Went Psycho!,If you aren’t a part of the Mormon church is it an ok place to live? UT looks so beautiful.
The Day My Butt Went Psycho!,I had no idea about the Mountain Meadows massacre until Under the Banner of Heaven. What a PR job by the church
The Day My Butt Went Psycho!,"But not cancelled, the victim can bring them back if she wants, at anytime..."
The Day My Butt Went Psycho!,"How did he seem cold and disconnected?

In my opinion he seemed to be making everything about himself. He did break down a few times about the deaths of the children and his step father. What did I miss?"
The Day My Butt Went Psycho!,"Do you remember that it was a whites only cult, and then President Carter told them if they kept that ""rule"" they would have to pay TAXES ??
All of a sudden, they changed and became a ""non racist"" cult...."
The Day My Butt Went Psycho!,LSD is pretty legit tho
The Day My Butt Went Psycho!,Which are very acceptable traits in cults as long as you profess belief.
The Day My Butt Went Psycho!,"What would Colby gain from saying that Joe sexually assaulted them? I’m not saying I don’t believe you, but I don’t see the point in lying about that. 

I also had no clue she was married 4 times. Edit- just looked it up, and apparently she’s been married 5 times."
The Day My Butt Went Psycho!,I recall Ryan's mil starting a gfm the minute Lori was arrested in Hawaii. Ryan quit his job at a lube centre car wash type job had his car repossessed was living with mil wife new baby. Don't think he's worked since but has had another baby with his now separated wife. He needs to man up do the responsible work needed to support his young family. Instead seems to want to live off drama and paid tv interviews.
The Day My Butt Went Psycho!,"No, he is not a loving married man. He is, after all, Lori's son."
The Day My Butt Went Psycho!,"Because he is one of the people interviewed for the documentary, he is depicted as someone you’d feel badly for. Then, he was arrested for sexual assault - the same week the series is airing."

Must have been after the second hole"
The Day My Butt Went Psycho!,The only right answer 👆🏼👏🏻
The Day My Butt Went Psycho!,"Yes and it’s beautiful. But the culture is not friendly to non Mormons. Its a “good ol boy” state, aka which powerful Mormon family you know."
The Day My Butt Went Psycho!,Yes as long as it’s not Provo
The Day My Butt Went Psycho!,"Yeah, I have no idea about the legal system. What exactly is he supposed to have done? And to whom? (Not doubting or judging, just curious about the context)"
The Day My Butt Went Psycho!,"Idunno to me he seemed like he just really didn't care enough. When calling his mother in prison after finding out they murdered his brother and sister his first thought was to record it and not even shed a single tear and he was barely angry. He only broke down once and even when he broke down he just covered his face and when he finally moved his hands there wasn't even tears and his eyes weren't red. The reporter who was reporting that the children's bodies were found seemed more upset then he did. This guy's whole entire family was murdered by his mother and he didn't shed a single tear. I just felt his behaviour was very off and idunno I guess narcissistic? Maybe he has the same mental issue his mother has just hasn't gone completely insane like her. Of course he's gone through stuff too but it was just was weird to me how completely unphased he was by everything. Imagine if something like this happened to you I mean I know personally I would not be able to fathom it or keep it together. And I definitely wouldn't be calling my murdering mother telling her ""I still love you but I can't believe you went this far! My siblings!? 🤪"". Even him calling them his siblings was just odd too. It's such a cold phrasing given the circumstances, that's what you call your brother and sister in a professional setting, but calling them your siblings while you're calling your mother in prison after finding their bodies buried in her back yard?!  Just my 2 cents, everyone grieves differently at the end of the day but dam he realllllyyyyyy didn't seem to care much that his whole entire family blew up. Even this story here, you'd think he would hold on to the family he created for dear life with everything that happened but he has SA charges and he's cheating on his wife? Sussy baka"
The Day My Butt Went Psycho!,🤭🫡
The Day My Butt Went Psycho!,Joe Ryan took a polygraph which he passed. Yes her marriage to Chad Daybell is her 5th husband.
The Day My Butt Went Psycho!,Colby did it because Lori asked him to. Colby was paid hush money by Lori for years.  When she stopped paying he got mad and turned on her. Colby is not a good guy. How much do you think he was paid for the documentary? I sympathize with him in that he was raised by Lori and of course his values would be all over the place due to that.
The Day My Butt Went Psycho!,Calling the murders of someone’s stepfather and siblings “drama” is heartlessly reductive
The Day My Butt Went Psycho!,Interesting point: I wonder how many members of Lori's family have EVER had a JOB ??
The Day My Butt Went Psycho!,Obvs this person is not okay
The Day My Butt Went Psycho!,"WOW !! A play within the play !!
I think there are more shocking events in the near future !!"
The Day My Butt Went Psycho!,"once the r/LoriVallow trial starts in Jan 2023, it’s gonna be 24/7 nonstop piping that insanity to everybody’s screens.  Lori & Chad took Mormon true crime to a horrific next level."

The Day My Butt Went Psycho!,"Whoops, thank you! Fixed it!"
The Day My Butt Went Psycho!,"Yeah, that was *his* hang up, not hers. He was a classic hypocrite- being very socially active and faithful in the church and then doing whatever he felt like in his personal life."
The Day My Butt Went Psycho!,"A friend of mine was made to sit alone on a bench outside the SLC Temple as her son was married.  He converted to please his fiancé but neglected to tell his Mom that after she travelled 1000 miles to attend the wedding she wouldn’t be allowed to actually see it.  Happy ending, two years later he announced he was gay. She was relieved the church no longer wanted him cuz she still did."
Dragons: Race to the Edge,"Nope and I ADORE the movies! Watched them all as an adult, after college and still became obsessed! Thanks for the rec!

Also, if you haven't already, Trolls of Arcadia and the subsequent tie-ins (3 below and wizards of Arcadia) are also awesome! My husband and I have watched the whole series together about 3 times

Edit: and for the record, we don't even have kids!"
Dragons: Race to the Edge,"Loved that series, but FYI, **it's the third of three series**; Netflix is essentially missing the first two seasons. It got retitled a lot as Dreamworks kept swapping contracts on everyone. The seasons (in order) go:

1. *Dragons: Riders of Berk* (20 episodes), essentially S1 \[Cartoon Network\]
2. *Dragons: Defenders of Berk* (20 episodes), essentially S2 \[Cartoon Network\]
3. *Dragons: Race to the Edge,* essentially S3-5 \[Netflix\]

Netflix never got the first two series \[they're both up on Peacock at the moment and I believe they're also airing on Universal Kids\], and also did the streaming-usual thing of purchasing a single animation season of 26, then splitting it up into two parts and presenting them as two separate 13-episode seasons (eyeroll).

The two follow-up shows, *Dragons: Rescue Riders* (Netflix. Preschool show) and *Dragons: The Nine Realms* (Peacock, set modern-day) have completely different showrunners, setups, and characters, and aren't really connected.

\--edited to add which networks the shows premiered on."
Dragons: Race to the Edge,"Yes, my 5-year-old loves everything HTTYD, both movies and TV. I've seen all of the TV eps multiple times at this point. It's really not bad."
Dragons: Race to the Edge,"It's what made me like the IP the most. It fleshed out all the characters more than the movies did. 

The last movie felt a bit of a letdown because of this show, while it looked amazing it felt like all these supporting characters suddenly were reduced to bit part characters. They felt more like characters that actually mattered in the tv series.

Still I liked the ride that everything that ""How to Train your Dragon"" gave. I would say it's a bit less all ages than the Trolls of Arcadia, but as an adult I still enjoyed the watch through."
Dragons: Race to the Edge,There are also two (equally good) earlier seasons — respectively subtitled *Riders of Berk* and *Defenders of Berk* — making for a total of eight seasons. The new subtitle (*Race to the Edge*) and redesigns were due to *How to Train Your Dragon 2* just having come out at the time. I would highly recommend both.
Dragons: Race to the Edge,"I'm a huge fan of the movies so I watched the show when it was initially released and remember liking it and getting invested in the storylines. I rewatched it a few months ago and was surprised by how much I still liked it. It's can be really funny and they do a good job of expanding the world, and a lot of the dragons they introduce are really cool. The villains are also generally really well done."
Dragons: Race to the Edge,"Quite liked this show and the preceding seasons *Riders* and *Defenders of Berk*, really well-done ""interquel"" between one of my favorite animated trilogies ever. My biggest complaint with the show would simply be that it had...a very hard time handling its villains. Specifically, it really liked giving them ridiculous redemptions. They would be well-written antagonists, but out of the like...5 ""big bads"", 3 of them got hastily-done, not very convincing redemption stories, the most egregious example being Dagur who *murdered Heather's parents and her entire island*, but then comes around to be a total goofball ally to the heroes by the end.

Like, once or twice is one thing...but you do soon enough notice the pattern that the show's method of handling the majority of its villains is ""Big Bad villain does evil stuff, *worse* villain shows up and does evil stuff, original Big Bad turns good, rinse and repeat."" It's an extremely minor nitpick, but one that I had a hard time getting over when I recognized its existence across the series."
Dragons: Race to the Edge,"HTTYD movies are big favorites of mine, I think they are all stunningly beautiful, funny, and heartfelt. I have watched the series, and find them worthy companions to the films."
Dragons: Race to the Edge,"The dragon riders series were fantastic.
As everyone mentioned you can watch them in order, Riders and Defenders before race to the edge.

The quality of the show and what they did with the characters was exceptional. When the sequel movie came out, I was so disappointed with it because it felt like it threw away everything done during the tv series.

I'd throw away the movies and just take the series as the sequels to the first movie."
Dragons: Race to the Edge,I've never seen it.
Dragons: Race to the Edge,Nope
Dragons: Race to the Edge,"Yup. Followed it as it was coming out. Has its flaws, but I really enjoyed it for the most part.

  Also, when you say you saw Race to the Edge, do you mean _just_ Race to the Edge, or the two single-season preceding shows CW did too? Riders of Berk and Defenders of Berk, respectively. Those were less tonally sophisticated, but still worth watching if you liked Race to the Edge."
Dragons: Race to the Edge,"I absolutely love this show. I watched it as well with my son a couple years ago (a couple times). It’s definitely a show that a family can sit down and watch. They don’t have it listed on anything when u try to look up a list of all of their movies and shows. What others were good that you have watched that were similar to this, other than the movies?"
Dragons: Race to the Edge,Could not have said it better myself!!!
Dragons: Race to the Edge,"If anyone knows the list of ALL of the movies and shows I would be very great full. I’ve tried to look it up on many different sites, and I just can’t seem to find one that has a list of all of them in order. For instance, if I hadn’t already watched race to the edge, I never would’ve found it. It’s not listed anywhere when you search all movies and tv shows. I came across it when we were looking for a movie on TV. We forgot which one of the how to train your dragons one it was so I was trying to search all, and I couldn’t find it until I went on a streaming platform"
Dragons: Race to the Edge,"Another good recommendation is the Dragon Prince, which has 3 series and several more planned.

The Dragon riders shows, Arcadia and Dragon Prince are my netflix favorite cartoons."
Dragons: Race to the Edge,">Trolls of Arcadia

**Tales** of Arcadia. :)  \[See also: r/TrollHunters\] . Guillermo del Toro and Marc Guggenheim.  The series, in order on Netflix goes:

1. [*Trollhunters*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2oNgZlbSKI) (3 seasons)
2. [*3 Below*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfVmNGUA-eo) (2 seasons)
3. [*Wizards*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6adVDTR79n4) (more like a miniseries)
4. [*Trollhunters: Rise of the Titans*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H4Y21Hg2L8) (movie)

*Trollhunters* is also most notable for having to deal with the death of their leading man (Anton Yelchin) when he'd only finished voicing most of S2, and they came up with an incredibly cool in-story reason for why Jim's voice changes.

Other for-kids shows/cartoons you may want to try, that I (also kidless :-) would include:

* [*Star Trek: Prodigy*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBE7d8sH5Rg) (Paramount+/Nickelodeon). The showrunners, Kevin and Dan Hageman were the story architects for S1 of *Trollhunters*. Just saying.
* [*Dark Crystal: The Age of Resistance*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3_owZfYVR8) (Netflix). Best epic fantasy show in recent years.
* [*Bluey*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJkn-r-rJJY) (Disney+) This one is preschool-safe. You'll also learn a lot of Australian along with all the feelz. It's amazing writing. Also the episodes are only 7 minutes long. :)
* [*Ducktales*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XcOWOLX1z14) \[2017\] (Disney+). Look. David Tennant is voicing Scrooge McDuck and Lin-Manuel Miranda is voicing Gizmoduck, and the triplets are voiced by Danny Pudi (Huey), Ben Schwartz (Dewey) and Bobby Moynihan (Louie). Webby is Kate Micucci.
* [*The Dragon Prince*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-djK0YhLmg) (Netflix) \[kind of *Avatar: The Last Airbender/The Legend of Korra*\-adjacent, as one of the three co-creators was head writer on AtLA (Aaron Korsh), and another one was a diretor on AtLA (Giancarlo Volpe).
* *Green Lantern: The Animated Series* (HBO Max). Showrun by said Giancarlo Volpe and Jim Krieg. Best damn Timmverse/DCAU show that isn't, strictly speaking, a Timmverse/DCAU show. Everything I wanted from a Green Lantern movie and never got. 
* [*Kid Cosmic*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBZ9UkhblkM) (Netflix). Craig McCracken (*Powerpuff Girls, Fosters Home For Imaginary Friends).* Co-developed with Francisco Angones one of the two guys who created the *Ducktales* reboot.
* [*Hilda*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCojP2Ubuto) (Netflix)
* [*Over the Garden Wall*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MchGCjJMv3E) (HBO Max)
* *Steven Universe* (HBO Max). Best. Damn. Show.

Not-little-kid-oriented cartoons (both with occasional zombie action):

* [*What If?*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9D0uUKJ5KI) (Disney+). More TV-14, though. :)  Head writer on this show is AC Bradley, who has her writer credits all over *Trollhunters* and *3 Below*.
* [*Genndy Tartakovsky's Primal*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4UN616BFDA) (HBO Max). An Adult Swim TV-MA show with almost no dialogue. Lotta blood spatter, but insanely good writing. 

\--edited to link up to youtube trailers/clips."
Dragons: Race to the Edge,"I have seen those, love them!"
Dragons: Race to the Edge,I notice you don't mention the movie that undoes those tie-ins and makes the whole franchise worse by association.
Dragons: Race to the Edge,The movie kind of makes the show pointless sadly.
Dragons: Race to the Edge,"Neat

Didn’t realise the franchise had that many seasons/shows"
Dragons: Race to the Edge,Where does it fit in the chronology
Dragons: Race to the Edge,I might be crazy but I think I knew who the last big bad was from the moment they were introduced. I felt so vindicated by it when it finally happened.
Dragons: Race to the Edge,What do you consider adult level writing?
Dragons: Race to the Edge,Haven't seen any Trolls of Arcadia movies. So you're recommending to *not* watch it?
Dragons: Race to the Edge,Between the first and second *How to Train Your Dragon* movies.
Dragons: Race to the Edge,"Rise of the Titans on Netflix is the last movie in the saga which ends the entire thing.

I personally didn't like the ending at all. I don't want to spoil it, but the comment above should give you sort of a clue of what might happen. It's not Game of Thrones bad, but I would put it around Dexter ending bad (before the new series started) I wasn't a fan.

If you're a fan of the saga you'll probably watch it anyway to see how it all ends. And I'd say go ahead because it's another opportunity to see these characters again, just be prepared that you might not like the last couple of minutes of the movie."
Dragons: Race to the Edge,"The ending could make sense *if* they were going to continue from it somehow, but as an ending for the whole franchise, it was a really weird choice."
Dragons: Race to the Edge,"Good to know! I *detest* a bad ending. I've loved re-watching the shows, so I'll skip it."
Dragons: Race to the Edge,"Spoilers for Rise of the Titans:

>!I think I even would have disliked it if they had continued. Because it essentially makes everything that happened so far, not have actually happened. So everything one would have liked about the saga,  woosh gone.!<

>!Character wise I also didn't like that the main character was heavily affected by everything that had happened to him as the Troll Hunter, that he would give all that hardship to his ""best friend"" instead. Like ""here, I'll mess your life up, bff!""!<

Dragons: Race to the Edge,"Fantasy Nerds trying to ""win"" at Fandom (a Kobayashi Maru if ever there was one) are going to take this red meat and turn it into the choicest of turds sprayed all over their favorite places like someone turned a rabbit's ass into a gatling gun...

...but *I'm* over here kinda marveling at how Cobra Kai still has the power it has, despite the fact this season is maybe the first one to show that this series is *maybe* overstaying its welcome? That first episode ESPECIALLY seemed like it was Flanderizing itself.

Still though - it's crazy how a decades-late ""legacy sequel"" to The Karate Kid, one that started life as a YouTube series even, went to Netflix and blew all the way up."
Dragons: Race to the Edge,Cocomelon is peak prestige television for kids. They are addicts for it
Dragons: Race to the Edge,CK up there reestabilishes order in this world of chaos
Dragons: Race to the Edge,Nielsen's metrics of million and billion minutes is quite useless.
Dragons: Race to the Edge,"I have no dog in this fight, but wouldn’t the show on Amazon have more reach? We try to limit how many streaming services we are paying for at a time, but Amazon stays because we would be paying for Prime regardless."
Dragons: Race to the Edge,Had no idea cobra Kai even released! God dammit!
Dragons: Race to the Edge,Still no season 6 confirmation for Cobra Kai has me disheartened.
Dragons: Race to the Edge,Most people who watch HOTD don’t stream it but watch on HBO channel. It’s not a streaming exclusive so their numbers will be off
Dragons: Race to the Edge,"It’s interesting. 

I don’t know anyone IRL who is watching HotD but I do know a *bunch* watching RoP. 

My internet experience is the exact opposite. HotD memes and references all over my feeds with nary a (positive) peep about RoP. 

I’m watching both because I’m a nerd, obvs, and the only team I’m on is “entertain me so I don’t unalive myself from unbearable ennui.”"
Dragons: Race to the Edge,I haven't heard of some of these other shows.  Anyone know anything about The Devil In Ohio or Cocomelon?
Dragons: Race to the Edge,"This is a big win for Amazon.  They kept the same great numbers as the first week, with only 3 days left until episode 3."
Dragons: Race to the Edge,B but but they didn't stick to the lore'!
Dragons: Race to the Edge,"HOTD is better, cry harder"
Dragons: Race to the Edge,"Not surprised, i think it's because of the popularity of the streaming services. HOTD has been GOT level good, but hbo max isn't as popular as the other 2. Very few shows are worth a streaming service, but HOTD is shaping up to be one."
Dragons: Race to the Edge,Speaks to how dumb & simple we are collectively.
Dragons: Race to the Edge,"I don’t know a single person who enjoys rop, honestly surprising"
Dragons: Race to the Edge,She Hulks viewer count is higher than either on streaming lol (HOTD overall is higher due to viewers in HBO). But straight up She Hulk has more viewers than Rings of Power
Dragons: Race to the Edge,"So lets do some quick math here for HOD and ROP here to see how many potentially full watches each show has.


1. Rings of Power had 1.203 billion minutes for 201 minutes of episodes. That is roughly 6 million total viewers if each view watched all 201 minutes for ep 1-3

2. House of dragon had 1.016 billion minutes viewed for rougly 246 minutes of content in ep 1-4. That is roughly 4 million viewers if each view watched all 246 minutes of content in ep 1-4.  When you add 3.2 million from HBO's main cable channel for ep 1 I that would put total viewership for HOD around 7.2 total viewers, ahead of ROP's roughly 6 million.


If we want to go into rating war talk the clear winner seems tk have been House of Dragon. And I am highly critical of both shows, especially recent HOD episodes, so I am not biased one way or another"
Dragons: Race to the Edge,"Just wait for number for ep 4, that's when RoP fell of the cliff"
Dragons: Race to the Edge,is there a TL;DR for what show is better based on this? I dont want to read article.
Dragons: Race to the Edge,Franchise projects dominating? Not looking good for prestige tv.
Dragons: Race to the Edge,How can anyone like cobra Kai still? The first 2 seasons were great but these later ones got old so fast. Watching adults act worse than teenagers time after time was so ridiculous…
Dragons: Race to the Edge,It's so weird that people have actually seem to have chosen sides like they win something if one of the other has higher ratings.
Dragons: Race to the Edge,"I just assume it's all bots.

I like HotD and dislike RoP.

I don't care enough to explain it. I also don't care what veiwer numbers it gets, because I don't give a shit about HBO or Amazon."
Dragons: Race to the Edge,"Drives me crazy. I like both shows for different reasons. It's allowed. People can do that. 

I also like DC and Marvel, Star Wars and Star Trek, Country and Western.   

Sheesh."
Dragons: Race to the Edge,Who you callin' a nerd?
Dragons: Race to the Edge,"Yep, thoroughly enjoy it. It's ALOT of people's guilty pleasure.  So many perfect callbacks from throwaway lines and situations in the movies."
Dragons: Race to the Edge,"Oh yeah, it's a great little show and totally binge-worthy, but I'm pretty sure these kids don't have parents (or the parents don't give a damn if the kid spends all their time at karate dojos, or comes home with a few broken ribs).

Let's be honest, all the adults in the show should have been jailed for child endangerment a good while ago."
Dragons: Race to the Edge,I think Cobra Kai is even funnier when I consider that it basically started as a joke on How I Met Your Mother.
Dragons: Race to the Edge,Agreed but this season was still great television. There needs to be a reshuffling of characters but the show is still great.
Dragons: Race to the Edge,"Its live action shonen, people know what to expect. It doesnt tAke itself seriously and is self contained. This seasons plot from the villain was to literally take over the world with karate. Its hilarious. That being said, yeah maybe next season should be the last. Or not. Who knows."
Dragons: Race to the Edge,"> That first episode ESPECIALLY seemed like it was Flanderizing itself.

Huh? It's been that way since the beginning lmao. Not taking the show serious and leaning into itself is what makes it enjoyable, it's complete nonsense otherwise."
Dragons: Race to the Edge,Only 1 season left to it too.
Dragons: Race to the Edge,"> 
> ...but I'm over here kinda marveling at how Cobra Kai still has the power it has, despite the fact this season is maybe the first one to show that this series is maybe overstaying its welcome? That first episode ESPECIALLY seemed like it was Flanderizing itself.

I wish the season had gone more with that goofy as heck plot.

Johnny Lawrence out just randomly kicking ass and right wrongs with his two sons in tow would have made for a much funnier and entertaining season.

It really felt like Johnny was completely checked out (in the best way possible) for about 80 percent of the season and it was still the best thing going on."
Dragons: Race to the Edge,also i’d bet most people are watching hbo through cable still
Dragons: Race to the Edge,Does that matter? Viewer ratings having never been qualified by how niche a channel is or isn’t. More people watching a show is what ratings like Nielsen care about. Whether they are watching it because they have the channel or not doesn’t matter much to them.
Dragons: Race to the Edge,"I want more, but if Season 5's ending ends up being a series finale it, it did tie up a bunch of things nicely."
Dragons: Race to the Edge,"No the majority do stream it, but there is still a big chunk watching cable."
Dragons: Race to the Edge,"> I don’t know anyone IRL who is watching HotD but I do know a bunch watching RoP.

For me it is the opposite. Nobody I know watches ROP, while almost all of them watches HOTD."
Dragons: Race to the Edge," ~~Cocomelon is a toddler show on YouTube that was acquired by streaming services to play their videos. It is a sing song style show.~~

Dragons: Race to the Edge,Nothing you just said makes sense. Most people watched the earlier episodes last week. People don’t usually rewatch the episodes they just watched a few days before
Dragons: Race to the Edge,"Why are you adding 3.2 million from episode 1 when linear viewership dropped to 2.5 million with episode 3  and was the just under that for episode 4, the episodes in question for the week reported.

https://variety.com/2022/tv/news/house-of-the-dragon-episode-4-ratings-viewers-1235371398/

Wouldn’t that put viewership of HotD closer to 6.5 million by your numbers?"
Dragons: Race to the Edge,HOTD is not on ep4 it’s 3 and 3 hrs
Dragons: Race to the Edge,Rings of Power is performing better on just streaming apps compared to House of Dragon but when you add cable numbers House of Dragon is the show pulling more viewers overall in the US
Dragons: Race to the Edge,Ridiculousness is expected with Cobra Kai...that's why people like it.
Dragons: Race to the Edge,"This is very apparent on the box office subreddit (which, as a sidenote, ballooned from <100k to nearly 1 million people since the beginning of 2020 when the box office was pretty dead and as a result now sees a lot more fandom clashing rather than box office analysis) where the box office gross of movies has become a proxy for various fandoms to take potshots at other fandoms for a vague claim of superiority. It's very strange - almost parasocial, like the financial success (or failure) of a franchise is a measure of quality or the superiority of one franchise over another (even if they are in completely different genres). These franchises are tied very tightly to some people's identities.

Then again, we've seen this in other things like sports, where arguably people shouldn't have as much emotional investment into a team as they sometimes do in reality."
Dragons: Race to the Edge,People who watch and enjoy both are the only winners. Normalize liking more things.
Dragons: Race to the Edge,"You’d think they’d want both shows to succeed, which would lead to more high budget fantasy shows."
Dragons: Race to the Edge,So weird since almost everyone I've talked to either doesn't give a shit about either of them or is planning to watch both of them regardless of ratings.
Dragons: Race to the Edge,"Isn't it just the same fandom war shit that has existed for decades? Marvel vs. DC, Star Wars vs. Star Trek, Tolkien vs. [absolutely any fantasy series ever]...ultimately, it shouldn't matter which one technically ""wins"" as long as both franchises are regularly pumping out material, and it's good for any product to have competition; it's just that recent years have made it easier to clash with fans of things you dislike because of how universal social media is and how much fans tend to tie their identities to the media they consume 

Historically, though, fandoms were often stuck in their own (generally private) spaces, such as websites or forums, but now everyone just uses Reddit, Twitter, Youtube, whatever, so I think fights are a lot easier to pick, and any division feels a lot more obvious"
Dragons: Race to the Edge,"I’m watching em both, plus Andor! What a time for streaming television! Haters Gonna Hate. They think it makes up for the lack of any likable personality traits."
Dragons: Race to the Edge,I'm just glad I get both!
Dragons: Race to the Edge,"And nobody seems to mention, Amazon Prime has far more subscribers than HBO because it has several services included. Viewership numbers hardly reflect quality or viewer enjoyment levels."
Dragons: Race to the Edge,I haven't seen much of either group talking about the other one. Seems more like a media narrative to me.
Dragons: Race to the Edge,">Huh? It's been that way since the beginning lmao

It does it BADLY more frequently now.

It's not like my comment is talking about it being *a serious drama* up until now. My criticism, aside from being mild as shit (I'm specifically going out of my way not to be mean to it because I STILL LIKE IT) has nothing to do with it's nature AS a show. I'm not criticizing what **it is**. I'm criticizing that it's not **AS GOOD at being what it is** and *maybe* it's overstaying its welcome."
Dragons: Race to the Edge,"Article says 1/3 of the viewers are watching HotD on cable, and not included in the count"
Dragons: Race to the Edge,"Yes, actually, it matters quite a bit. Certainly to Amazon and HBO, who are looking at their shows’ popularity within their subscriber base relative to its cost. These are also two very different businesses, one of which is only secondarily a streaming service. 

The Dragon show may be driving HBO subscriptions, whose primary business is television, whereas the also very expensive Rings show may not be moving the needle much for Amazon Prime subscriptions at all. 

If Bezos is a fan, it may not matter, but I am old enough to remember the Sci-fi channel cancelling shows with high ratings because they cost too much to make. 

From a marketing standpoint, you want to break down every possible thing about your audience (and your competition’s audience) that you can. Absolutely some niche audiences are more valuable than others. One HBO subscriber may be worth 100 geriatric CBS prime time NCIS watchers. Even in the olden days, it was never about the straight numbers.

ETA: And Nielsen would want to know your poop schedule if they could sell that information."
Dragons: Race to the Edge,"Same, everyone at work is talking about HotD Monday morning again, just like during the original GoT run but I don't hear much about RoP other than, 'I tried to watch it but wasn't that interested.'  
  
But hey, if people like it, I'm glad it's doing well."
Dragons: Race to the Edge,"I did not lie.  It's a victory and a good part of this sub said that it would drop a lot in the second week, because they said that the initial numbers were natural because of the public's curiosity. 

 I don't get anything from Amazon (but if they want to pay me, I'd be happy).  But I have fun with this sub's mental juggling."
Nana,[deleted]
Nana,"Great write up!


I'm not familiar with most of these, and I watch a shit-ton of TV and movies. I really like the effort, and the writeups are perfect in length.


Again, not knowing these a lot, is Severance the highest ranked English speaking show? (Nothing against non English speakers of course) 


Also, I'm guessing most of these are straight drama? Language and genre might both be useful things to put in parenthesis for anyone else unfamiliar.


Totally agree with the couple from White Lotus being great characters, I much preferred season 1 (which seems like a hot take) but those two, specifically the woman, were very interesting characters to me."
Nana,"""hidden gems of 2022 for me"" might be better title for this post.

i must admit some of these plots engaged my curiosity. im gonna look for them. rhanks for the list."
Nana,"How you pick what to watch? I’m overwhelmed with all these shows in Netflix and I always seem to pick the limited series or those talked about in reddit, especially regarding to the foreign shows or K dramas. There isn’t much write-ups or reviews in English."
Nana,I am glad and surprised Prisma is number one. Well deserved
Nana,"This is Going to Hurt: I'm a medical student and I thought I'd seen every medical show but this one is on my list now! I've heard that this show shows the reality of a doctor's life without all the glamor of medicine.  
  
This show compared to other medical shows what do you think and what other medical shows have you watched I'm curious!"
Nana,"Insanely odd for the 2 anime to show up to be an average romcom (with crazy production value) and a good but lesser known sequel.

(Oh NVM I thought this was a list from some website not yours! Still surprised to see MDUD though!)"
Nana,"What did Frank Ocean say that one time? ""I got two versions. I got twooo versions…""

..................

I didn't like what 2022 television had to offer for the most part. One too many disappointments for me as well. I mean I watched a lot more shows than I did in 2021, yet struggled to find 25 new shows for this list. But I do think my top 13 here are genuinely great.But anyways, thanks a lot for reading, even if you just scrolled through this lol. Same time, same place, next year? ❤️"
Nana,"Neat list.  A lot of shows I've not seen.

A few shows from 2022 I'd recommend if you haven't seen em:

- Black Bird

- SAS Rogue Heroes

- The Offer

- Under the Banner of Heaven"
Nana,Recency bias but I just finished Yellowjackets and really had a great time watching it.
Nana,No Atlanta? Both seasons last year were incredible
Nana,Pachinko is the most slept on series of 2022
Nana,"1. She hulk
2. Ted lasso
3. Ms Marvel
4. Harley Quinn show
5. Lord of the rings
6. Spy x family 
7. Chainsaw man
8. Loki
9. Mob psycho
10. Hot D"
Nana,Which ones did you see? 🤔 amma take a wild guess and say The Bear and Severance?
Nana,"> is Severance the highest ranked English speaking show?

Yes. Even though Pachinko got a bit of english too. 

> I'm guessing most of these are straight drama? Language and genre might both be useful things to put in parenthesis for anyone else unfamiliar.

Yea. And yea I should probably do that next time."
Nana,"i just read the synopsis and glance at the preview a bit sometimes just to check visual/production quality. if it looks like something that could be potentially great, i check it out."
Nana,🙂💕
Nana,It’s great but it’s depressing.
Nana,"What other new anime from 2022 did you think were great? 

Anime for me in 2022 was, *meh* tbh. I didn't like Summertime Rendering much and Chainsaw Man hasn't gotten to the good parts of the manga yet. I was suppose to see Bocchi The Rock! before making this list, but ended up getting an ear infection so couldn't."
Nana,I'd count Yellowjackets as 2021 TV show.
Nana,on the other version of this list pinned on my profile.
Nana,"Nice! Do you often give the pilot a go before fully committed to the whole season? Any shows that you have given up midpoint? 


Like I tried to start Warrior Nun because the trailer seems fun and the lead actress looks very beautiful, also being afraid of it being cancelled (it indeed got cancelled then), but have given up after episode 6 or 7… cause the plot is very weak and the characters are laughable.


And then I tried to pick the ones that got high ratings in imdb, and started watching Extraordinary Attorney Woo and I do like it so far! Although sometimes being too cheesy at times, the acting is excellent and the stories are well-written. Highly recommended."
Nana,"Dropped Summertime after 5 minutes lol.

But personally, Bocchi the Rock is incredible TV and is my #1 show of any medium this year. And I'm not even usually into anime comedies. It's just that good, glad you're gonna try it! I'm an Attack on Titan fan after the massive story shift in Season 3, and S4P2 aired at the start of the year, although personally I don't like rating something that isn't an entire season.

Otherwise Chainsaw Man would be a decent pick even if, as you said, it hasn't quite gotten to what makes it special yet. Cyberpunk Edgerunners is one that would be worth watching and has near universal praise, and my other 2 shows to hit a 9 were Kaguya S3 (but it's not everyone), and Paripi Koumei, which I thought was an extremely passionate show but it might hit as a 7-8 for others. 

From your list I probably have to watch the 2 seasons of Tatami though. I had no idea it was well regarded I never looked into it!

Other than that though, yea there was a lot of meh. Spy Family went from potentially great to just average as it went on, LycoRyco got a lot of hype but was merely good not great (needed some writing cleanup). Personally though Dress up Darling was ok at best, and Gundam and To Your Eternity were massive disappointments"
Nana,Ignoring some great sequels I thought Chainsaw man was awesome even if it hadn't gotten to some of the good parts  of the manga. And I really liked summertime rendering (although I haven't seen the last few episodes). Lycoris recoil was fun. Spy X Family was great.
Nana,Oh my bad. I’m late to the party.
Nana,"> Do you often give the pilot a go before fully committed to the whole season?

I give everything at least 4 episodes before I decided whether it's working for me or not. Unless it's *reeeeeeeaaaaally* bad... then I quit after the 2nd or 3rd. But that rarely happens. That has only happened like 4 times in the past 3 years. 

> Any shows that you have given up midpoint?

A shit ton. 

> Extraordinary Attorney

I was suppose to watch this show too but unfortunately didn't have time for it. There are some great shows coming out of korea nowadays (3 are on this list too lol), but they require commitment with those lengthy episode counts and runtime. 

I recommend ""**D.P.**"" on netflix too if you haven't seen it. That's another outstanding one."
Nana,"> Bocchi the Rock is incredible TV and is my #1 show of any medium this year. And I'm not even usually into anime comedies. It's just that good

damn. guess i gotta hurry and check this one out now. lol."
Nana,"You should check out Kotaro Lives Alone, such a good show!"
Nana,"Heard good reviews about DP but I haven’t managed to watch it, with season 2 coming this year I may watch it soon!

For other Korean shows I watched My Name, Hellbound and of course Squid Game in 2021, which were all very good. Narco-Saints, The Glory and Somebody are shows I saved in 2022 but not started yet."
Nana,I did hear about it! I'll add it to my list thanks!
Nana,Time to [blow some damn minds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=615SOafGE50).
Nana,"Patrick Stewart shows up in season 11. Star Trek and Frasier were both Paramount shows, all produced on the the same lot under the Paramount Studios banner (even if for different networks), so makes sense there's some actor crossover. Kelsey Grammer even did a guest spot on TNG once."
Nana,"There's also a lot of overlap between Star Trek and Frasier's parent show Cheers. Kate Mulgrew and Brent Spiner both did guest turns in Cheers, and apart from Grammar's appearance on TNG, Kirstie Alley and Bebe Neuwirth both crossed over to Trek as well."
Nana,That was so wonderfully cringey! How and why did this even happen?
Nana,"Yup... I remember Grammer in TNG too. When Spiner and Visitor appeared on Frasier, both of their shows were long over so they really had no reason being on Frasier. 

Spiner might've been shooting Star Trek: Nemesis at the time, so his appearance makes sense if anything."
Nana,I'm on a season 11 episode where Sarah Silverman (Voyager) and Penny Johnson (DS9) made appearances in the same episode. Mind blown!
Nana,"Same parent company produced both shows, and comedy actors are usually up for some goofy bullshit."
Nana,"Amanda Peet is married to one of them. I guess the article kind of forgot to mention that. #Dany'sNavy  


Still, the cast looks decent. It'll be interesting to see how it develops, as the article is pretty light on details of what the show plans to encompass."
Nana,I don't see why that's relevant. But the cast does look mighty impressive.
Nana,"Dany Kinda Forgot, but we viewers never will.

Of course, on a more serious note, considering how D&D's families were sent *death threats* just for being related to them in the aftermath of season eight, I can imagine why articles would leave that part out. No need to stir that hornet's nest."
Nana,"Very true! It always boggles the mind that people would take matters that far over a fictional television program. It's totally fine and acceptable to dislike the way a story proceeds, but to take it to that level is absurd."
Nana,Courtney Cox was fairly obviously pregnant for the last season of Friends. She wore some baggy clothes but that was about it.
Nana,"Grayza on Farscape. The show got abruptly cancelled, and then two years later brought back as a finale miniseries. By that point the actress playing the main villain was heavily pregnant. They didn't hide it or talk about it, only obliquely referenced in one line (""for the sake of our children"")."
Nana,Debra Messing’s pregnancy was mostly ignored on Will & Grace. There’s like one episode where she mentions gaining a bit of weight but for the most part they just put her in billowy clothes and had her sitting on the couch.
Nana,"Seinfeld;  Julia Louise Dreyfus's pregnancy in Season eight was barely covered up (and not acknowledged in the script.

Mad Men; January Jones's pregnancy was handled by having the character deal with weight gain"
Nana,"HIMYM, Cobie Smulders had a lot of visible weight gain, especially in her face while pregnant and they just ignored it."
Nana,King of Queens: Leah Remini was very visibly pregnant and it didn't seem like they did much to hide it. They threw some ponchos on her but it was still very noticeable.
Nana,"Seinfeld 

Elaine just went on holiday when she got too pregnant for a big coat to cover up lol"
Nana,"The actress who played Margaret (Leo's assistant) on West Wing was pregnant, and they said maybe one line about it? It was never a part of the story and was quickly dropped like a lot of things on WW.

That's maybe as close to completely ignoring it as you might get."
Nana,"Frasier. Daphne got real fat because she was overeating as a way to avoid having sex for the first time with Niles because she was so nervous.

Yes, it was as dumb as it sounds."
Nana,Amy Poehler Parks and Recs
Nana,"Not a show, but Gal Gadot was pregnant during the filming of Wonder Woman. When they went back for reshoots, she was 5 months pregnant and they had to cut out the stomach of our suit and put a green cloth over it so that they could edit it out."
Nana,"Over on Star Trek in the 90s, TNG and Voyager both basically did the same thing. When Gates McFadden and Roxann Dawson were pregnant, they gave their characters  jackets. Doctor Crusher got her lab coat, B'Elanna got an engineer's jacket. 

I understand the lab coat. That made sense. But the ""engineer's jacket""? That was pushing it."
Nana,"I believe that the Nanny did that with CC.

Edit: Never mind, it appears that it was acknowledged on the show by making her mentally unstable for a time."
Nana,"There was Season 5 of Sex in the City when SJP was pregnant. 

Its pretty obvious throughout and was super  hard to hide as a lot of that show was filmed outside with walk and talks."
Nana,Angella was very pregnant during the fourth season of The Office.  She also refused to wear makeup or the wardrobe for the big Toby party at the end of the season.  She was at the end of her pregnancy and just couldn't deal with it. So she just sat in a chair in her own clothes.
Nana,"Mariska Hargitay on SVU, up to 7 months, then took leave."
Nana,McMillan and Wife did this thing where they'd sort of nonchalantly acknowledge Susan Saint James's pregnancies and then it was like her character had two still births because she'd be thin again and there was never a child.
Nana,"Although they hid/didn't mention it in some of the episodes, It's Always Sunny used Kaitlin Olson's pregnancy as part of the storyline during season 6."
Nana,Man all your double negatives confuses me as to what you're actually asking.
Nana,"Geez, is [this](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/ef/ed/9c/efed9c1a71cbaaed21e501f0786c30cd.jpg) the pregnancy we're talking about?"
Nana,I did nooot know that
Nana,They definitely did attempt to hide her and Alyson’s pregnancy though. She was always standing behind the couch or carrying a purse in front her her belly (totally a natural way to do it) and then they wrote Lily off the show for a whole month.  You can argue they didn’t do it *well* but that’s different from not even trying.
Nana,They did it with Alyson Hannigan too. There was even a scene when she was in a hot dog eating contest and they show her baby bump and joke it off like it's hot dogs
Nana,">Has there ever been a show that didn't try to hide the fact that an actress was pregnant

They hid their bellies though with big coats and bags though."
Nana,I think that counts as hiding it though. That's the same for Lily in HIMYM. The actress isn't there during some episodes (Barney offend her a lot with a joke) and has her belly hidden in a few before and after that.
Nana,"In retrospect, I wonder how Jane Leeves felt about that. Some women struggle with body image when going through pregnancy due to weight gain, and they basically had Daphne become little more than the butt of fat jokes the entire time Leeves was pregnant until she left (Daphne went to fat camp) to have the baby."
Nana,I think they were definitely trying to hide it.  For example in the episode with the time capsule she was standing behind the huge time capsule all the time.
Nana,I've watched this series like half a dozen times and never realized she was pregnant at some point during it
Nana,"Didn't they do the same for Scarlett in, was it Civil War or one of the later Avengers, maybe Infinity War"
Nana,I liked how they dealt with Nana Visitor's pregnancy.
Nana,"They did address it as her gaining weight from being depressed that Maxwell and Fran got engaged though, then had her institutionalized so the actress could have the baby, so it wasn't completely ignored."
Nana,"They reveal it to the audience in a scene full of meta jokes about actresses hiding pregnancy, while Lauren Lane was holding in front of her big posters with the word ""baby"" on them."
Nana,"Honestly I thought Lily just leaving for a month was hilarious. We all knew what it was for, so they just kept it simple"
Nana,Apparently she stopped by the set on the way home from the delivery ward.  She sort of swooped in for a quick cameo at the gang's booth with a huge beach bag covering her torso.  It was kind of funny.
Nana,Reminds me of Julia Louise Dreyfus who reacted negatively to a similar pitch when she got pregnant while filming Seinfeld. Apparently when  Larry David says “Elaine should just get fat” she started crying lol though with hindsight she says she wishes she had said yes.
Nana,"Yeah all those examples seems to be cases where they did hide it (well or not) or includes it in the plot. Haven't read one actually answering the question lol (and tbh, I don't have one)"
Nana,I think she was pregnant while they were shooting Ultron
Nana,"Who?

Edit: why downvotes man? I genuinely have no idea which superhero's name is scarlett here?"
Nana,"I don't remember if Keiko's pregnancy pre-dated Visitor's real life pregnancy, or if they knocked Keiko up just to explain Kira away."
Nana,"Yeah, already edited my comment.  I was incorrect."
Nana,"Scarlett Johansson.

Aka Black Widow."
Nana,"Yoshi was definitely conceived to justify the Kira’s inexplicable pregnancy, but I’m pretty sure they had the good sense to announce Keiko’s pregnancy in an episode before the one where she had to transfer the fetus to Kira, so it felt more natural than trying to sell both those plot lines at once."
Nana,"I can see their confusion, Scarlett Witch is a Marvel character and I've never heard ScarJo referred to as just her first name, it's like saying just Sylvester for Sylvester Stallone"
Nana,"The seires is reportedly 10 episodes long and will premiere in 2023. Most of the [original cast](https://disney.fandom.com/wiki/X-Men_%2797) is returning

>“They want this show to pick up where the original X-Men series wrapped,” said Julia Lewald. The original show ended on a bit of a cliff-hanger (Spoiler Below)  

>>!After Charles Xavier was gravely injured by Henry Peter Gyrich, it looked as though the classic X-Men mentor might not make it. Thankfully, Empress Lilandra arrived to take the wounded Professor X into space to be cured by the Shi’Ar Empire.!<  

>X-Men ’97 will “build off of that” according to original showrunner Eric Lewald, who emphasized that the new show will continue the X-Men story fans were left with."
Nana,Dunanunanaaa nana. Dunanunanaaa nana!
Nana,JEEEEAAAAAAAAAAANNNNNN!!!!
Nana,…so 38 year old me will be just as confused as 12 year old me. Got it.
Nana,As long as they don't continue with the final season's art style.
Nana,"“You’re always pushing around people smaller than you. Well, I’m smaller…try pushing me!”"
Nana,Thank fucking god Gambit is back in a mainstream X-Men project again. Fave character always done dirty by movie studios lol
Nana,"Hopefully the writing is better. I re-watched the series a few years ago and seasons 1-2 were genuinely enjoyable. Then 3-5 got way more “this is a kid’s show, start dumbing it down.” 

The animated Spider-Man series on the other hands stays pretty thoughtful from beginning to end.

I need to re-watch Batman and see there."
Nana,[deleted]
Nana,"I hope they keep the theme song, [it slaps](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAkL2-vh2Sk)."
Nana,Can we finish the 94 Spiderman show as well? My mans still in the Multiverse somewhere trying to find Mary-Jane.
Nana,There's hope for one final season of Spider-Man the Animated Series.
Nana,Gargoyles next plz
Nana,As long as Gambits in there I’m good
Nana,Wrap up Silver Surfer you bastards
Nana,So will Magneto be running the school in Charles' absence?
InuYasha,"For any of you r/television junkies, lemme just say right now.

Mob Psycho 100 is one of the best anime series I've ever watched, and although Fullmetal Brotherhood is my favorite *story*, I think Mob might be my favorite anime of all time.

Between Doctor Who, Doom Patrol and Harley Quinn and now this, HBO Max has been crushing it with it's lineup."
InuYasha,Is The Promised Neverland any good? Keeps popping up in different threads that I'm browsing
InuYasha,"The Streaming Wars may get some flack but I for one have been loving it. Because every time I do the math, getting several Streaming Services always adds up to being much less than paying for Cable/Dish."
InuYasha,time to rewatch mob then. and promise neverland been on my list for a while now it is easier to use
InuYasha,Holy cow! Now this is what I'm talking about! Finally I can enjoy season 2 of Mob Psycho without relying on my boyfriend's VRV account!
InuYasha,Oh sweet. I liked Aldnoah.Zero.
InuYasha,Shame its not available here
InuYasha,So are these shows being pulled from Crunchy and Funi?
InuYasha,"The frustrating thing about this is its unclear what options they're adding these with.  The existing series seem to be a scattershot of subbed and dubbed versions, but the exclusively English-dubbed ones are missing English-subtitles, missing even closed-captions for the hearing impaired."
InuYasha,"Adding to this, Mob Psycho 100 is a must watch if you like anime in any capacity. S2 has one of the best fight scenes in anime period. Not only that but it's actually a well-written slice of life that most other animes can't even scratch the surface of. You'll like it if you're into the parody style of OPM (I mean, written by the same guy), you'll like it if you're into Studio Ghibli-esque stuff (think of the end scene of first ep s2), you'll like it if you're into any ordinary shonen, it legit has that kinda appeal. The shows only barrier to entry is the art style, but you get over it after an ep or 2."
InuYasha,Facts 🔥🔥🔥
InuYasha,"Owning at least half of those IPs is a good way to have them.

Having bought one of the two major anime import streaming services is another good way."
InuYasha,Harley Quinn is on Max now?
InuYasha,They have the best lineup of all the streaming apps in my opinion.
InuYasha,"Watching through Mob Pyscho 100 now - THANK YOU! I'm only on season one, episode eight, but I'm completely hooked."
InuYasha,That’s a convincing plug. I’ll watch it.
InuYasha,"Just googled it and it looks like they put a My Hero Academia costume on Saitama from OPM, is this intentional?!"
InuYasha,highly recommend it
InuYasha,"I'm pretty critical with animes, I think most modern popular ones kinda suck, but Promised Neverland is very well written, I gave it an A or 9/10."
InuYasha,"Yes and no, the first season is fan-fucking-tastic and I'd highly recommend it. However the source Manga it's based off of... It... Drops the really hard after the first arc. So basically I'd highly recommend the first season (and so far only season) and just leave it at that. The rest of the story in the Manga has the fastest drop in quality I've ever seen."
InuYasha,The first arc is killer but the decline in quality after it is overwhelming. It gets really bad at some points.
InuYasha,Very very good
InuYasha,It's based off a *very* good manga arc and does it to a inferior degree. The manga also strictly dipped in quality after that first arc so the anime is likely to follow suit. Overall it's quite good but definitely not worthy of any *the next best anime* hype you may be coming across.
InuYasha,I agree. Plus there is so much more good content these days imo than there was 10+ years ago.
InuYasha,You don't have many streaming services or aren't counting internet costs
InuYasha,"No. Both HBO Max and Crunchyroll are owned by AT&T. Their plan seems to be for HBO Max to have some anime, but Crunchyroll/VRV will be the their main anime streaming service. Aside from the Ghibli movies, all anime on HBO Max should be on Crunchyroll. The Funimation shows should be fine until the current licensing deals expire, but even then they should be fine. Madoka Magica, for example, is an Aniplex show, and both Aniplex and Funimation are owned by Sony, so that'll stay on Funi."
InuYasha,"While the art style could be seen as a barrier, I personally find it to be one of the show’s most endearing traits."
InuYasha,"> Having bought one of the two major anime import streaming services 

What is the other major services"
InuYasha,Coming in August.
InuYasha,It ain't on mine
InuYasha,"“Wow. Look at what you’ve done. This has never happened while I’m conscious before.”

That scene gave me chillllllllls."
InuYasha,The original manga was made by the same guy as One Punch Man.
InuYasha,"I think the second major arc is still pretty good (although nowhere near as good as the first), but yeah, everything after that isn’t really worth it."
InuYasha,It really felt like the author had a great concept to start a story but had no idea what they should do after that part was over.
InuYasha,Should be noted that the anime only contains the first arc
InuYasha,i only use the main sub services. i dont use niche stuff like crunchy roll or criterion. hbo max netflix is more than enough for me. disney plus suck ass for a single adult. but family wise it is nice to have.
InuYasha,"The average cable bill is over $200 (source [https://decisiondata.org/news/report-the-average-cable-bill-now-exceeds-all-other-household-utility-bills-combined/](https://decisiondata.org/news/report-the-average-cable-bill-now-exceeds-all-other-household-utility-bills-combined/))

For internet on it's own I typically pay under $70. I'm certainly not spending $130 on streaming services and I'm typically subscribed to 4-6 of them, which is probably more than most people."
InuYasha,"To me its a lot like One Piece. Jarring at first, but it makes it stand out, and once you start to like everything else about it, you become attached to the style associated with it"
InuYasha,I think he is referring to Crunchyroll and Funimation? I know Crunchyroll falls under WarnerMedia and I think Funimation is owned by Sony.
InuYasha,It comes early next month
InuYasha,Bummer
InuYasha,"It's made by the same author of One Punch Man.

Whereas for OPM they adapted the anime to look more like the redrawn manga, Mob Psycho tried to adapt ONE's art style into the series.

OPM was a new take on superheroes, MOB is a new take on psychic powers. 

Some of the fight scenes in Mob *easily* rival OPM, too, but there's so much fucking heart whereas OP is more, I dunno, wacky?

EDIT: I dunno why this got added as a reply to you, RegularJoe. It was supposed to be to saul, but good to see you already answered it. :D"
InuYasha,"I really don't think this was the case.

The Promised Neverland really had the potential to be a significantly longer series, maybe not One Piece but around Naruto level, it's just the author kind of gave up in the middle of it. Almost every major plot thread does not pay off and we're left with a series that starts off really cool but isn't worth it. In a lot of ways like GoT."
InuYasha,"There are like 4ish main ones now? Netflix, Hulu, Amazon Prime, and HBOMax? Then include Disney+. At least 50.50/mo + internet? More if you want higher quality and more limited commercials."
InuYasha," imo you only need two a month and i use amazon prime  other things beside tv so it not really put in the tv sub section it more of a costco/samclub membership for me. then change the secondary subscription every few months based on your needs. i feel netflix is essesntial since they actually release new content every week and at least once of a month i hear culture defining show or critic darling from them. hulu doesnt have a good tv show every single month and for live tv i can just use an digital antenna, amazon tv doesnt anything killer, and then disney plus never releases new content aimed for adults minus mando which was up until december then two months off until clone wars and then like 2 months off until hamilton. there are internet bundles that is 50 dollars a month plus the 50.50 that is 100 dollars essential with the full package of networks. with 1 or 2 sub it is 70 dollars still."
InuYasha,The top 8 stream platforms cost $59.94+tax a month if you are willing to use annual plans and the ad-supported plans.  I'd personally never count internet in the cost of streaming because I'd have internet regardless of whether or not I had any streaming service.
InuYasha,">I'd personally never count internet in the cost of streaming

 Inherently wrong. You can't use streaming services without internet, and possibly higher internet than you otherwise would have.

>The top 8 stream platforms cost $59.94+tax a month

If you use questionable math I assume. I already listed but 5 and it was 60$. I don't think the next 3 are only going to be $10/mo. CBS all access is another 6 by itself"
InuYasha,"No reason to count the cost of internet if you were going to have it regardless of streaming services.

&#x200B;

Netflix $8.99, Amazon $8.99, Hulu $5.99 w/ ads, Apple TV+ $4.99, CBS All Access $5.00 w/ ads, Peacock Premium w/ ads $4.17, HBOMAX $14.99, Disney+ $5.83."
InuYasha,">No reason to count the cost of internet if you were going to have it regardless of streaming services.

 Decent internet is a required cost of streaming. 

>Netflix $8.99

1 device in *SD*. I don't know who would have this, but ok, sure, with that savings, you come under 60"
InuYasha,InuYasha went on for way too long. I lost interest and dropped off watching it years before it was over.
InuYasha,Seems kinda meh.
InuYasha,"Seems really unnecessary imo.

Does everything from the 90s need a reboot or sequel? No."
InuYasha,"i tried rewatching it a few years ago and couldn't get through much of it, i forgot how episodic it was and i can't do anime like that anymore."
InuYasha,">InuYasha went on for way too long. 

Let me tell you about a little show called One Piece..."
InuYasha,The InuYasha anime was from the 2000s
InuYasha,In the last two episodes of Euphoria they kept cutting to the same scene of Rue’s dad’s funeral and Rue’s speech. It was touching the first time but after the 4th or 5th it veered into “ALRIGHT I GET IT” territory.
InuYasha,">Is there any scene you can think of where that meme played into your head in any series you've watched, where they constantly hammer in a theme or event constantly to almost annoying levels?

Vox Machina when they keep bringing up how they're a band of losers every 2 minutes."
InuYasha,"Not entirely TV but in Zack Snyder’s Justice League, when the choir comes BLASTING every time Wonder Woman appears. Frankly it’s comical. 

The Legend of Korra also had that shameful filler episode toward the end of either the 3rd or 4th season. Literally the entire episode was the characters recapping the events of the season and reusing the footage. I recognize it’s kinda Nickelodeons fault for shafting the creators of Korra but my goodness that left a sour taste in my mouth. 

I also admittedly didn’t get very far into The Bad Batch, but definitely in those first few episodes, whenever Wrecker is pretty much the catalyst for problems in what felt like half the episodes bc he’s dumb, reckless, violent, and entirely too strong."
InuYasha,"In Inuyasha, they LOVE playing the flashback of that scene where Kikyo pins Inuyasha to the sacred tree with her arrow. They played it constantly. If anything so much as slightly referenced Inuyasha and Kikyo or Naraku in correlation to either they'd play it. They loved it so much, they tried recreating it with Kagome like three or four times, which was, of course, accompanied by the flashback so we'll really get what they're trying to reference. It drove me up a wall."
InuYasha,That and Elliot singing those lyrics over and over again for what felt like 10 minutes
InuYasha,Man that finale was weak.
InuYasha,"I'm not going to be as clear-cut as the others, so I'd say: ask yourself what it is you don't like about anime.

If what you don't like is the usual premise of ""plucky young boy becomes the best ninja/pirate/warrior through adversity, also there's an on-off relationship with Main Female Character"", then rest at ease: Deathnote is miles away from that sort of things.

However, if you simply don't like the style of anime (the drawing, the pacing, the sometimes overstretched exposition scenes), and that's something that's completely understandable, well, you'll still have a bit of that in Deathnote, although much less than in lots of other anime.

In general, it is regarded as a great series (manga or anime) and I personally really liked it. You have to be ready for rather long explanations since the main characters are geniuses planning 1000 steps in advance, and it's still anime, with its scenical, musical, ""plotical"" codes. But this might very well be the series that reconciles you with the genre!

TL;DR: You will probably enjoy it, except if you really can't stand the usual anime stylistic styles. And even then, it has a rather light anime ""vibe"".

PS: The soundtrack is also pretty awesome, regardless of the anime (here's [one of the main themes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3LeZNlI0Xg))."
InuYasha,"Yes, there really aren't the ""omg anime kawaaai"" cliches that make you remember its an anime. It's also one of the best crime dramas of all time
"
InuYasha,"Honestly. If you want an anime to get you into anime, as in something to transition from Live action to animation, i'd recommend Cowboy Bebop. Also check reviews on sites like IMBD. I say imdb because it's full of critics of TV & Film so you get an opinion from someone who may not watch as much/any anime as say someone on an anime forum."
InuYasha,"Controversial opinion:

Watch until episode 25 and then walk away.

"
InuYasha,"Yup, I think it's the only anime I've watched and I enjoyed it immensely. "
InuYasha,"I'm not an anime buff, Death Note is one of the two series I've watched. I was blown away by it. It is extremely clever, amazing characters. I found myself rooting for both sides; it blurs the line between good and evil. I love stories with fiercely intelligent characters, like sherlock, hannibal etc. The two characters of Light and L constantly trying to out-do each other creating this tension that I've never seen. Could recommend it highly enough. "
InuYasha,"Yes you should. I'm not a big anime fan myself.  Friends have tried to get me to watch Naruto but I got bored after a few episodes.

Death Note is a completely different story. I loved it. Great show allround.

I preferred the Japanese version with English subs btw. The original language just fits better (as it does with most shows/films)"
InuYasha,"Regardless, if you're a fan of metal, watch the intro and outro then be done with it."
InuYasha,Don't watch anime if you don't like anime
InuYasha,"Death Note is one of the single best series for a new anime watcher. I'm not an anime fan myself, but I am a fan of quality, and I consider it one of the best tv shows I've watched.  "
InuYasha,It's the only anime I've watched outside of Dragon Ball Z and One piece but I thought it was great.
InuYasha,"I'm also here to suggest Cowboy Bebop. I'm not big into anime, but I watched a few series as a kid. Cowboy Bebop stands out to me as incredibly artistic and engrossing. "
InuYasha,"Attack on Titan seems to be pretty good to watch even if you don't like anime. My dad doesn't like anime but watched through the whole season of AoT, even if he did complain and made slightly racist comments about the japanese the entire time."
InuYasha,"I ended up disliking Death Note quite a bit. It started out great, but got very groan-inducing and silly. I felt like it tried too hard to keep topping itself. I quit watching rather far into the series and just read episode guides of the rest. What I read made me feel pretty confident that I made the right decision to stop.

I will just say this: if you watch it and find yourself annoyed by the characters or how topsy-turvy they keep making the plot, just know that these things increase in frequency and degree as the show progresses."
InuYasha,"It's one of THE BEST anime's out there. Watch it.

"
InuYasha,I watched it and have never watched anything anime since. It wasn't bad. I didn't love it and haven't even had a thought of re-watching it since then but I don't regret seeing it. Give it a try I say. 
InuYasha,"Watch the first 5 episodes, if you like it, keep watching. If you don't like it, you've only lost an hour and a half."
InuYasha,I got to about episode 20 and lost interest but it was good up to there 
InuYasha,"Everyone's recommending different anime, but the guy isn't asking for recommendations. He's merely asking whether he'll enjoy this one anime as someone who doesn't particularly enjoy anime. Sheesh."
InuYasha,I loved it. Only Anime I ever watched. Tried a few others afterwards but they couldn't hold my attention. Death Note is short and can be seen in a marathon session.
InuYasha,I read it instead. Don't regret that choice at all.
InuYasha,"Yes. I have never seen much anime, but my friend introduced me to Death Note once, and I had to watch it all! It is a great series; incredibly thought provoking and twists and turns. It really has you rooting for all main characters, and the intro music is fantastic!"
InuYasha,"Controversial opinion here: I do like anime but I thought Death Note was incredibly boring. Don't watch it. 

But to reiterate what's already been said here: Don't take our word for it, watch an episode and decide for yourself."
InuYasha,"I'm not a huge anime fan. My girlfriend is way into this show, so we watched the series together. It was alright. "
InuYasha,Just to throw this in the pot as well: There are two feature films with real life actors with the same storyline. They are not as complete as the TV show or the manga but still quite well crafted and an enjoyable watch imho.
InuYasha,I personally think Death Note is way overrated and really not great. I don't really get the love here on reddit. I guess enthusiastic anime fans?
InuYasha,"I'm not a big anime fan, but I really enjoyed Death Note.  "
InuYasha,"Now that its on netflix I've watched it a 3rd time.

Definitely worth it"
InuYasha,"You could watch the two live-action movies. They're not exactly the same, but they're good. "
InuYasha,"You should definitely watch it... You will find that nothing, neither anime nor western tv show/ movie can offer what death note does
"
InuYasha,100% yes.  One of the best stories ever told regardless of it being an anime 
InuYasha,"Anime is just another media. Not liking it as a form of entertainment is kind of silly. That being said anime does have a terrible track record on average, but it isn't an worse than American TV on average.

Watch Death Note, Last Exile, Cowboy Bebop (firefly before firefly and better than firefly). Full Metal Alchemist Brotherhood, and many more. Don't write off a whole medium because a lot of it is shit (And boy Can anime be shitty.)"
InuYasha,"Definitely, I've seen some anime I've liked but I'm alway a little hesitant about new ones. Having said that Death Note is great cerebral crime drama that would probably work just as well in live action. Its great if you like shows like Breaking Bad, House of Cards, or Fargo"
InuYasha,"Definitely, one of the best animes out there alongside code geass, mirrai nikki and attack on titan.
"
InuYasha,"It depends on why you don't like anime. That said, give the first episode a shot. It's a great antihero story with plenty of thrills."
InuYasha,There's a live action movie that you can watch if you don't like anime. And it's good as well.
InuYasha,"So weird that a thread like this popped up when I just watched Death Note for the first time a few days ago. I think the plot was great and the first 30 episodes are very interesting and fun, after that it becomes a little iffy.

Since I had no prior experience with anime, I started out by watching it in English but decided to check out if it felt any different in Japanese with subtitles and it definitely does. It's not like the English version is bad, but the Japanese voice actors just bring something essential to a show that is relatively ""dark"".

Anyhow, after watching the show I am definitely inclined to watch more anime and I hope you will be too!"
InuYasha,Attack on Titan. Subbed is great but dubbed is pretty good too. 
InuYasha,Watch Cowboy Bebop. You wil develop an obsession.
Johan Falk,"I'm gonna take downvotes as a ""Skip it"". Thanks y'all."
Johan Falk,"Sure. Never heard of it, but give it a shot, what else do you have going on. It could look bad and be well written. It could have a feature you love others hate. Always try for yourself."
Johan Falk,"Not seen Johan Falk but on the topic of Euro crime I’ve recently started watching The Missing and it’s fantastic, most of the cast are British but it’s set in mainland Europe and the main detective is French."
Johan Falk,It is DEFINATELY worth it
Johan Falk,I’m a big Johan Falk fan. The earlier stuff isn’t as good as the later stuff. I’d stick with the three seasons from 2009-15. Very well acted. Great story. Fantastic characters. highly recommended friend!
Johan Falk,"Its really good, my favorite crime show. but you might not like it because its swedish."
Johan Falk,majority in this sub cant read subtitles
Johan Falk,[deleted]
Johan Falk,I'm on my movie hiatus man! Lol. Still got over 400 on my watchlist so I want my next show to be worthwhile.
Johan Falk,"Entire trilogy slaps. Season 1, 2 and then ""Baptiste""."
Johan Falk,I drool over Bron...lol. Literally in my top 10 of all time favorite shows. I actually haven't heard of Jagarna...and by the looks of it this sounds exactly what I'm looking for. Good looks man. Thanks.
Johan Falk,but isnt Falk a movie series aswell?
Red Dwarf,"Mr. Flibble’s very cross… you shouldn’t have run away from him. What are we going to do with them Mr. Flibble?

😮🐧 

We can’t possibly do that… who’d clear up the mess?"
Red Dwarf,"Since the return on Dave years ago and all the content they've made since, the writing hasn't been as sharp and honestly there are whole episodes I have just not found not funny but, regardless, there's something cozy about seeing these characters back again every time. 


Red Dwarf: The Promised Land wasn't great but I still had fun with  just because it meant seeing those 4 play those parts."
Red Dwarf,Fish!
Red Dwarf,"Great, now we don't need to go to red alert any more as that would involve changing the light bulb."
Red Dwarf,"So your saying Dave = Cheap and Lazy?

Crikey!!!"
Red Dwarf,"If Lister has given up getting to earth for the sake of it, are they just bumbling about the universe with no goal or direction now? Seems a bit nihilistic even for a sitcom."
Red Dwarf,Someone smoke me a kipper.
Red Dwarf,Fun! Fun! Fun!
Red Dwarf,I love Red Dwarf but I didn't like any of the newer episodes from Dave. I barely cracked a smile throughout. The episodes that aired on the BBC were a lot better written and much funnier. I think they should have let it go out on a high instead of dragging the corpse of a classic series way past the finish line. It didn't look like they had much of a budget for the Dave episodes and it all came across as cheap and lazy in my opinion.
Red Dwarf,( random quote from the show )
Red Dwarf,One of my favorite all time shows. I even read some of their red dwarf books.
Red Dwarf,I didn't know there was a legal dispute
Red Dwarf,"Gonna be against the crowd here, but I like season 7 and think 8 and 9 were the only real misfires. Stoke Me A Clipper is one of the best episodes of the series, and I love Tikka to Ride as well."
Red Dwarf,"Good to hear, I think it's an interesting world. I love seeing the RD crew, but I'd even love seeing another series in the universe. Red Dwarf is so far forward in time there would be plenty of room in the timeline to explore another crew."
Red Dwarf,It’s sad these two don’t want to work together anymore. It’s like Laurel without Hardy; The Lone Ranger without… that *native american* bloke.
Red Dwarf,[deleted]
Red Dwarf,The need Chris Barrie to finish reading the audiobooks
Red Dwarf,"Well, spin my nipple nuts and send me to Alaska!"
Red Dwarf,35 years old? How? I am 41 and remember watching this but didn't think I was only 6. But I do remember buying a sega game gear TV tuner so I could watch it at my families beach caravan holiday park in Hunstanton.
Red Dwarf,"Happened to rewatch 9-11 last week and there’s some really strong stuff in there.

Back to Earth just didn’t work at all but other than that and S 8 RD hasn’t really misfires at all.

V happy we are goin g to be getting more"
Red Dwarf,What the hell is Red Dwarf ?
Red Dwarf,I loved the show (and still do) I haven’t seen anything past the original run. But those are some classic funny moments.
Red Dwarf,"I know this will sound strange to some but I'd like it to continue in animated form. A cartoon series. I think it would give them more flexibility and add a new dimension to it all. It won't feel like the same old, same old."
Red Dwarf,Red Dwarf finds a multiverse wormhole where they encounter their American counterparts.
Red Dwarf,"> Grant has released Red Dwarf novels.

*One* novel. And a shitty five-minute fanfiction script picking up right where he left the show that, if I remember correctly, ends with all the characters getting eaten by a gloop monster."
Red Dwarf,Smoke me a kipper
Red Dwarf,"I don't want a reboot, it was perfect the first time around."
Red Dwarf,Season 9 was such a return to form and I hope they can recapture it.
Red Dwarf,What is this show? This is the first I ever heard of it?
Red Dwarf,"Well, let’s hope they’re not shit."
Red Dwarf,If this came back do you think they’ll give Lexx a second shot too lol
Red Dwarf,"So let me get this straight. You want to fly on a magic carpet, to see the king of the potato people... and plead with him for your freedom, and you're telling me you're completely sane?"
Red Dwarf,I thought 1-6 were peak. 7-9 were actively bad. 10+ have been no 1-6 but pretty great.
Red Dwarf,"I think the opposite. As die hard fan of Red Dwarf, I think that season 12 was one of funniest they made.

But we all have our own sense of humour I guess"
Red Dwarf,"My one wish for the series is that they'd ever address the continuity between the end of season 8 Only The Good and where they are today.

Red Dwarf was always irreverent but it also had moments of meaning and a purpose to things, I just hate that the recent series have just been essentially a standalone 'sitcom in space'.

The show and characters were pretty much my childhood in the 90s, I'd love for them to once again be able to address their circumstances and have goals, with the aim to one day move toward closure."
Red Dwarf,"Honestly, I feel like they need a writer's room, they need the people who grew up with the show to be given a chance to take the reins, write the stories they want to see.  Especially after the last two seasons, when they had to film the back-to-back, that's a lot to ask of a single writer to do."
Red Dwarf,"I definitely think the three most recent series have (10/11/12?) have been much more “on form” red dwarf. There is a LOT about them that is as good as some of the hey-day stuff of season 1-6. The episode with the lemons… oh lord.

It’s very hard to recapture nostalgia. When you look back on season 1-2, we love them because they were GREAT; but there’s also things about them that aren’t great. 3-6 have a different vibe, and it’s the vibe that ultimately made Red Dwarf the best comedy ever made… but we tend to have rose coloured glasses about these: we’ve watched them so many times and we know every single line. It’s very hard for new episodes to compete against that sort of embedded deep obsession we all have about the classic series.

There are moments in 10-12 that aren’t all that great. But overall, it is good Red Dwarf, and I think plenty of scenes and lines that are as memorable as some from 1-6.

We can all generally agree that pretending 7-9 didn’t really happen. Again, there are a few good moments that stand out as excellent, but the overall feel of the shows are wrong, they stray too far from the core of the concept, and the writing is generally flat. 10-12 has recaptured the best, and attempted to bottle it again, with pretty good success."
Red Dwarf,"BTE was ""alright for what it was"" - a Red Dwarf special made some 10 years later with heavy involvement from Dave (who said they wanted certain things, like no studio audience). I said as much to Craig Charles at a convention (who also doesn't like BTE). Series 10 has some good moments but was mostly ""Red Dwarf lite"".

11 and 12, and TPL, were better, sometimes nearly capturing Red Dwarf of old (M-Corp and Skipper probably being my favourites from those two), but also had some garbage +why hello Timewave)."
Red Dwarf,I’m gonna eat you little fishy
Red Dwarf,Fish!
Red Dwarf,Todays fish is trout a la creme
Red Dwarf,"""You mean the channel or the character?""  
""Yes."""
Red Dwarf,I think he's supposed to be finding Kochanski.
Red Dwarf,It's because Naylor writes them now. Naylor has great ideas but Rob Grant is the funny one of the two. I'll be looking forward to whatever Rob Grant writes.
Red Dwarf,Hahahaha!  I love it when they say or do that
Red Dwarf,"Fry me a salmon, I'll be back for dinner! Hahaha love ace ventura"
Red Dwarf,... so what was it?
Red Dwarf,"I know, the Justice Field should have taken care of that."
Red Dwarf,"Same,  but happy for anything that means more will be made"
Red Dwarf,"100% agreed. Tikka and Clipper have some of the biggest emotional beats in the entire series, Blue ends with one of the funniest sequences in the entire series. We also get a great origin story for Lister in Ouroborous, Kryten and Kochanski spark off each other really well, and Duct Soup felt like a sequel to Marooned. Also the best stab at serialisation the series ever took, with the Epideme virus leading to Lister's amputation leading to the nanites leading to the recreation of the Red Dwarf.

It's also the best the series ever looked, IMO, and packed full of great gags. It's always baffled me that fans tend to hate it so much. The only duff note about it for me is that Chloe Annette doesn't have much romantic chemistry with Craig Charles, but she does have great comic timing, and as mentioned, sparks really well with Robert Llewellyn. I liked having her in the cast, and the revival show has felt a bit poorer for her absence to me.

8 and 9 though, definitely by far the show's lowest point IMO."
Red Dwarf,Tikka is seriously great. The rest of series 7 is a no from me.
Red Dwarf,Ambivalence.
Red Dwarf,A very popular show.
Red Dwarf,Is that the novel that goes full bore into the stuff with GELF furniture and other weirdness?
Red Dwarf,"Here, look at this - https://youtu.be/oB-NnVpvQ78"
Red Dwarf,I think that warrants 2 hours W.O.O.
Red Dwarf,"The vibe was so different in S7 and S8, never more apparentl than the S8 bunk scenes which came across so like a US sitcom to me.

Having said that I maintain they weren't *bad*, S7 was pretty weak though I thought Epideme and Nanarchy were pretty great and felt like they had genuine peril from the virus. S8 had Back in the Red trilogy, Cassandra, Only the Good which were all pretty good and even the Pete two parter had some classic scenes.

At the very least grouping S7 and S8 with S9 feels a bit of a crime. I find it hard to consider anything past S8 canon, if that's even a thing in Red Dwarf, but S9 should be erased from history (along with Krytie TV)."
Red Dwarf,I only rewatch 1-6 cba with the rest. maybe a couple from 10-11-12.
Red Dwarf,"Original run good, the Kochanski years not so good. The Blade Runner pastige pretty Dire, the standalone series were fun the 4 part movie was anout 2 parts 2 long"
Red Dwarf,"1-6 is THE show, for me

The rest us just extra with varying degrees of success but 1-6 is the core of the show, imo"
Red Dwarf,My memory from all the Smeg ups vhs was they acknowledge the many continuity errors from series to series by not acknowledging them.
Red Dwarf,Could I jump back in at season ten and just do some retconning in my head? Maybe google bits that cause major confusion.
Red Dwarf,Enjoy your meal!
Red Dwarf,Does Chole Annets act anymore?
Red Dwarf,"What *is* Rob Grant doing? He allegedly left because he wanted to do more than just Red Dwarf (I'm sure that wasn't the only reason), but he barely released anything for years."
Red Dwarf,"I believe it was a ‘blank’ quote, instead of adding a point to the conversation just taking up time instead…"
Red Dwarf,I grew up in the 80s and I’ve never heard of this show….gotta be a Canada thing
Red Dwarf,"The one that heavily features GELFs is Doug Naylor's book *Last Human*. But GELF furniture isn't in it: if I remember correctly the thing about GELF furniture is from *Better than Life*, which they co-wrote.

Rob Grant's *Backwards* is the one that adapts the episodes ""Backwards"", ""Dimension Jump"" and ""Gunmen of the Apocalypse""."
Red Dwarf,That'll teach you to be bread baskets!
Red Dwarf,"Rob Grant's absence was obvious. He clearly reigned in the silliness Doug Naylor is prone to. Reading Infinity and Better Than Life then reading each of their solo books was a great way to see what each brought to the table.

I stand by 7-8-9 being actively bad though. There isn't an episode amongst them I'd call a classic, and not a single scene I specifically remember and laugh at. I will accept that 9 is worse than 7 and 8, but I really don't rate any of them, at all. Personal opinion only."
Red Dwarf,"They were very different, and I do have to give them credit for trying something different after six series.  S7 was attempting to really go ""pro,"" I guess, make it feel like a genuine sci-fi show but not a sitcom, which... parts worked, but I think it reinforced how important that studio audience energy was (losing Rimmer didn't help).  S8 felt like a bit of a victory lap, being the tenth anniversary of the series, they got everyone back, they wanted to do something bigger and grander than the last two years stuck on Starbug, they got to bring a bunch of guest stars in.  9 was a ""find your footing"" kind of season and I love how low budget it is, ESPECIALLY for a show in HD, it looks so wonderfully cheap and basic that it's refreshing."
Red Dwarf,"> came across so like a US sitcom to me.

The tone changed in s7/8 because they actually *were* trying to sell it to the US."
Red Dwarf,"I rewarch 1-6 regularly, but 10-12 only every so often. I got to see one of them being filmed, though, so I may be a little biased :D"
Red Dwarf,The real magic came from *both* Grant and Naylor. In both the shows and the books.
Red Dwarf,"I remember being confused as a kid in-between season 2 and 3 as to why Kryten had returned. what happened to Lister's babies and why Holly was a woman now.

but then much later I realised *it tells you right at the start* with the ""star wars blurb"" but it moves super fast and could only be read if you record/paused it (back when VHS was king)

That ep was ""backwards"" which had another ""VHS"" joke later in the ep calling out all the nerds who recorded and were playing it backwards to see what was being said

""MANAGER: You are a stupid, square-headed, bald git, aren't you, eh? I'm pointing at you, but I'm not actually addressing you. I'm addressing the one prat in the country who's bothered to get this recording, turn it around, and actually work out the rubbish I'm saying. What a poor sad life he's got!"""
Red Dwarf,"""Because we made...a...mistake. OK?!"""
Red Dwarf,"Basically entirely. I can't really think of any plot points in 10/11/12 that are directly linked to 7/8/9... It's just kinda ""more dwarf."""
Red Dwarf,Fish!
Red Dwarf,"They recast Kochanski once, they can do it again.

Maybe she'd like to come back for Red Dwarf though idk."
Red Dwarf,Not sure. I thought he left because he couldn't put up with Naylor anymore. They seemingly despise each other even though together they create magic.
Red Dwarf,Don't know what Rob Grant is doing now but he did a few novels. I really enjoyed Fat and Incompetence.
Red Dwarf,A blank quote?
Red Dwarf,The Rimmer Song (season 7) surely must have made an impact?
Red Dwarf,"Todays fish is trout a la creme, enjoy your meal."
Red Dwarf,Clare Grogan should come back. She looks great and was always the superior Kochanski
Red Dwarf,"Maybe.

Does she still act?
I am genuinely curious as to what she does now."
Red Dwarf,"Honestly it was the kind of thing I always liked least about Red Dwarf. I appreciate why others love it, but I probably didn't think about it once since I last saw it."
Red Dwarf,"Nope. Nada. Seems like she's unofficially retired almost 9 years ago, probably because she's been raising three kids? Dunno how old they are, either way wouldn't be surprised if she's decided to scale it all the way down afterwards. Living her life."
Red Dwarf,"He’s Arnold, Arnold, Arnold Rimmer…  
He’s never been mistaken for Yul Brynner  
He’s not bald and his head doesn’t glimmer."
Red Dwarf,Needs cat! Love Red Dwarf and Lister
Red Dwarf,"Rimmer is indeed a smeghead.

Went to the recording of one of the recent episodes (Siliconia). Absolutely brilliant experience."
Red Dwarf,Loved this show when I was a kid!
Red Dwarf,"Lister, is that a cigarette you're smoking? 

No it's a chicken"
Red Dwarf,SHMEEEEEEEE
Red Dwarf,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E4TLto-nKfU
Red Dwarf,"As funny as this was, I am still annoyed we never got to see him, three girls and a family-sized tub of banana yoghurt...

(On a side note, Danny John-Jules' performance in those first two seasons is up there with some of the all time greats. Indeed, if not *the* greatest. That 10 seconds of speeded up footage of him dancing shows you exactly why he was playing Cat the way he was and frankly made you want to revisit the preceding episodes just to marvel even more...)"
Red Dwarf,[deleted]
Red Dwarf,"Used to have this on cassette - alas, lost to the mists of time. Probably would be worth a pretty penny today."
Red Dwarf,"Danny John-Jules was a dancer before he was an actor, I believe. It also makes me laugh this was on top of the pops"
Red Dwarf,"The whole cast were so damn good at physical comedy in Red Dwarf but Danny John-Jules was a cut above, especially in the earlier 'cattier' seasons."
Danger Mouse,"PopArena has made some AMAZING discoveries in the process of making this series, finding footage of shows lost for 4 decades. If I wasn't a broke joke he'd be amongst my first Patreon subscriptions with Babish."
Danger Mouse,Thank you for this!   I subscribed.  My husband was a producer at Nickelodeon in the late nineties and early aughts and he will love this!
Danger Mouse,Steve reviews will also be a good channel if you appreciate cartoons from the past.
Danger Mouse,"PopArena is a fantastic channel - worth your sub and if you can afford a couple bucks, a Patreon backing."
Danger Mouse,I need to see this!
Danger Mouse,"Being a Brit who grew up on Danger Mouse 80s, the word ""Nickelodeon show"" being associated with it brings me out in irrational rage."
Danger Mouse,"Haha i'm with ya man - i'm a guy who has the classic bomb with lit fuse tattooed on his arm, the tattooist even borrowed my box set of original DM that I had bought in for art reference."
Danger Mouse,"David Jason not on voice...he ain't dead and he's still working.  :-(

"
Danger Mouse,This was my favorite show as a kid.......I even named my hamster Penfold
Danger Mouse,"Can't wait to see John Oliver, Lena Headey and Stephen Fry"
Danger Mouse,"The animation is way too clean and stiff. I really miss the organic look of older cartoons. Computers just take the life away from them. And that's not nostalgia messing with me, that's the damn truth. "
Danger Mouse,"OMG. Im guessing all the 'soul' of the original show will have been sucked dry by todays TV concept writers.

DM had slow moments, just dialogue, of sheer comedy class from David Jason. Im going out on a limb and predicting this will just be an all-out action fest, no heart."
Danger Mouse,This has John Oliver in it too.
Danger Mouse,"This should be the theme music
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAO8vxWn850"
Danger Mouse,With this one it's particularly bad because the original cartoon is noteworthy for how lazy the animators were.
Danger Mouse,"It's on CBBC, so I'm guessing the primary audience is kids, and they wouldn't have any nostalgia from the 'organic' look"
Danger Mouse,"Always assume a rehash like this will be a soul-sucking piece of shit that pays homage to the original only on the very surface layers, then you won't be disappointed, as it seems like we might be from this."
Danger Mouse,No it really shouldn't. That drum beat is way off. Terrible. 
Danger Mouse,"Calling them lazy is harsh, the budget was microscopic, the reason half of the episodes ended up at the north pole was because the white background didn't need painting!"
Danger Mouse,I know. Hanna Barbera was well known fot it's time and money saving animation methods yet they had more life than this. The lines are just too thick and square. 
Danger Mouse,"But it's not just nostalgia. It just looks boring and uninteresting. I know, it is targeted to kids, who'd watch anything, but it just annoys me how lazy the animation and character design looks. "
Danger Mouse,what
Danger Mouse,"If that had happened, than it certainly would have happened, that's for sure"
Danger Mouse,Are you one of those people that makes fantasy logo compilations on YouTube?
Danger Mouse,No. Just wondering and thinking
Danger Mouse,"I'm honestly not sure whether Danger Mouse was actually any good, or if it's just something I have warm and fuzzy feelings about because I liked the explodey bomb thing when I was a little kid. "
Danger Mouse,"So this is the recent reboot that was airing on (I think) CBBC? Watched a couple episodes with my little sister and thought it was decent, will give it another try on Netflix for sure. The voice acting is all great and perfectly cast. "
Danger Mouse,"Danger Mouse always felt like a sort of.. very polite british proto Aqua Teen Hunger Force. 

In that the pitch is its this Action Spy Thriller stuff except it's mostly DM and Penngrove not actually accomplishing a whole lot while this week's antagonist bemoans something entirely tangential to the actual scheme they've concocted. Then it's somehow foiled in the last 3 minutes or so with a quick explanation to the chief. "
Danger Mouse,The new version is actually pretty good.
Danger Mouse,I tried watching it recently and it was shit. It's all nostalgia man. 
Danger Mouse,[deleted]
Danger Mouse,"I remember Duckula too.

Basically the problem is that ""a spy... except he's a mouse!"" and ""a vampire... except he's a duck!"" aren't great concepts to build a show around. There's no synchrony or irony in the combination of spy and mouse or in the combination of vampire and duck, nothing emerges naturally from that."
Danger Mouse,"Oh man, did I love Count Duckula though"
Danger Mouse,"But those were just artistic decisions, Dangermouse is more ""A spy, except he is incompetent but really lucky"" and Duckula was ""A vampire, except he is a vegetarian hipster (before it was cool) with a teleporting castle"" "
Danger Mouse,I hope they retain the cheeky humor from the original series.
Danger Mouse,"I first thought.

The song writer?

Then brain worked again.

"
Danger Mouse,"used to love this show when I was a kid, and that one with the scary house - trapdoor or something? 

haven't seen in years - might youtube them after the soccer"
Danger Mouse,All these reboots from the glorious yesteryear!
Danger Mouse,"Danger Mouse, Powerpuff Girls, Sailor Moon...what's with all the reboots instead of producing original shows?

If you want to have an irreverent, cheeky british cartoon, just do it BBC. You don't need to wrap it in known characters- if it is good, it will be successful without the brand name. Give us something new instead of rehashing classics."
Danger Mouse,I'm hoping it's still David Jason doing the voice of DM. 
Danger Mouse,"Idk I loved this show as well as ""mighty mouse"" there is something to bringing back classic shows.  However some shows don't need to be brought back because they were just over and done with..... Can you imagine an Iraq version of ""M.A.S.H.""?"
Danger Mouse,Reboots?!  How about originals?   Been so long since I've seen Danger Mouse.  Wonder if it's actually good.
Danger Mouse,"Hopefully they pick up Dr. Katz and The Critic both of those are classic shows. The Critic would have a field day with today's movies.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONon4x0RFHg"
Danger Mouse,"Do you really want to see him in that weird PS2 CGI style, though?"
Danger Mouse,"As long as they don't do that ""3D"" computer animation, I'm on. "
Danger Mouse,"Yeah, hoping it maintains at least some of the old style."
Danger Mouse,[deleted]
Danger Mouse,"One of the best animated shows as a kid!

I wonder if David Jason will return, probably not..."
Danger Mouse,"As a fan of the original 80s cartoon (which 80s kid wasn't a DM fan?), I tried to watch the new series and while it was good, the BBC barely seemed to air more than the first 15 episodes last time I checked (which, admittedly, was around Christmas/New Year time), despite listing the episode numbers out of 50 so I hope Netflix UK have the complete series."
Danger Mouse,"You Can’t Do That on Television, Turkey TV and Danger Mouse were my shit when I was a kid."
Danger Mouse,"Oh God, I remember you knew you were up way too late once you started seeing the repeats of the earlier Nick at Nite airing."
Danger Mouse,What is Turkey Television? It seemed to be on a lot.
Danger Mouse,"Doctor Who is probably the most extreme example both in terms of overall length of show and gap in between revival. I think it's pretty easily worth it- the revival can be pretty shit at times of course, but so could the original. IMO the revival has overall reached higher peaks than the original.

Arrested Development S1-S3 is like the peak of the sitcom niche it occupies, but S4 and especially S5 are quite disappointing to me. The remix of S4 was even worse imo."
Danger Mouse,[removed]
Danger Mouse,"I was terribly disappointed with the Murphy Brown revival. The original was a workplace comedy with some political commentary. The revival was just heavy political commentary and jokes about getting older. Plus making Murphy's smug son exactly the same politically killed any chance of them having friction.

I liked the Mad About You revival because I thought it had the same feel, but the daughter wasn't very likable."
Danger Mouse,New Beavis and Butthead and Kids in the Hall are great.
Danger Mouse,"Of your list that I've seen, Girl Meets World, Dexter, Doctor Who, and The Twilight Zone were all worthwhile.  There are some others on the wikipedia list I've seen that were mostly okay, no other big hits.

Not a series continuation, but the Psych movies have been good and better than anything listed above.  Lucifer and Cobra Kai were both saved by Netflix and were good, but they were continued pretty quickly.  Same with Stargirl on The CW.

What I've seen:

Girl Meets World - okay and nice to see the original cast, but doesn't live up to the original.  I enjoyed it well enough even though I wish it were better.

Dexter - New Blood was pretty good other than the finale.  Best season of the show after 4 of the original, but not close to the best seasons.

Doctor Who - Haven't seen more than a few clips from the original but the reboot seems better.

Family Guy - I generally am not a fan of this but the continuation seemed to be more of the same.  If it's your humor I'd imagine it's a big hit.

Futurama - I haven't liked what I've seen of the continuations, they lost something for me.

MST3K - It wasn't the same with the different guy.

The Conners - I was young for Roseanne and hadn't seen it consistently when it was first on.  The continuation is okay but not funny enough for a comedy or good enough drama for a drama.  It doesn't live up to my limited memory of Roseanne.

The Twilight Zone - like the original, there were some hits and some misses.  It's easy to remember the hits on the original but there were a lot that weren't.  The continuation lived up to that history.

X-Files - Not good, but the show hadn't been good for awhile before it left the air.  Definitely not needed."
Danger Mouse,"Enjoyed Veronica Mars! I think any invested fan will enjoy but may feel some type of way about the ending.

I think the Futurama reboots are fine, not as consistently good as the original stuff though and I feel like I’m lower on the movies than most.

I think the Arrested Development reboot is kind of a disaster In comparison to the original. Gob and Tobias have really fun storylines but past that it’s pretty skippable.

I thought when Harmon rejoined Community after the gas leak season he did a great job of retooling the show… not as consistently good as before the gas leak but you have some really great ones here and there like the Ass Crack Bandit and the really bizarre one where the app redefines the schools social hierarchy.. it goes into some really weird directions that are worth checking out even though it’s maybe not as good as the show when Donald and Chevy were on it."
Danger Mouse,"Dexter New Blood was a good one. Dexter S8 was the worst thing I've ever watched. New Blood wasn't amazing, but it was way better than S8 for sure."
Danger Mouse,I love the Futurama movies but outside of a half dozen really neat memes I don’t think we got anything good out of the Comedy Central episodes.
Danger Mouse,"Amazing Stories (2020) - Not totally sure if this counts since it's an anthology series that was resurrected, but since OP included The Twilight Zone in their list, I'll count this one. The first episode is legitimately good. No complaints. And I thought episode 3 was okay. Not great, but fine. The rest of the episodes were a bit too silly or predictable for me.

Animaniacs (2020) - It's still a lot of fun, irreverent, and basically what you would want the Animaniacs to be in a revival. The only issue is how few different skits are available. It's almost entirely the Warners and Pinky and the Brain. And the few sketches that deviate from those two are rarely up to the same quality (though some do get there). It's worth watching if you know what you're getting into.

Arrested Development - It has some good laughs throughout the new seasons, and the Season 5 finale is almost the perfect series finale if you cut it off before the final mystery is revealed, but there's so much baggage and not-so-great moments, not to mention the actual final moment of Season 5, that I typically think the show is best with Season 3 as its ending.

Boy Meets World/Girl Meets World - This is maybe worth it if you have a fairly young child that you watch TV with so they can get the majority of enjoyment out of the show and you can enjoy the plot lines and characters from the original show, but of all the episodes I watched, I would not say that this ended up being worth it in the long run because the show really does cater to the younger audience than the older one.

Futurama - Yes, despite a few rough episodes being included in the new runs, the new runs still produce some of the best episodes in the series, progress the overall story of the show in interesting ways, and are still quite funny overall.

Heroes/Heroes: Reborn - Heroes: Reborn is perfectly middle-of-the-road Heroes. It doesn't reach the original show's highs, but it doesn't fall to the original show's lows either. If you liked or were okay with Heroes Season 2, you'll probably enjoy Reborn as it's a similar quality but ultimately better story. But it's not Heroes Season 1 no matter how much it wishes it was.

How I Met Your Father - It originally didn't have to be a continuation, but they have seeded a couple of plot lines from the original show into this one, officially making this a continuation of sorts. While those continued plot lines are fairly fun/interesting, they're such a small part of an otherwise mediocre-at-best show. So while this may one day be worth it as it continues, right now I don't think it is. You could argue that this is closer to a spin-off rather than a continuation/revival though.

Kevin (Probably) Saves the World - This is a weird one because the show itself isn't a continuation to another show. However, there is one episode that acts as a continuation of the show Reaper. And while it was awesome to see the characters from Reaper back and hear a little bit about what's going on in their lives, especially given Reaper's tragic early cancellation, there wasn't quite enough meat on those reveals to make it worth it, particularly when the main Kevin show is so-so itself.

Parks and Recreation - The resurrection for the COVID episode I thought was really well done. I recommend it.

Timeless - The show had gone off the rails in quite a big way, so the fact that the movie resurrection not only managed to tie up loose ends, serve as a satisfying conclusion, and be a fairly consistent an entertaining story was nothing short of impressive. If you liked the first two seasons, it's a must-watch. If you thought those first two seasons were mediocre, it's worth watching to see if it addresses your issues. If you couldn't stand the first two seasons, it's a better version of more of the same. But overall I'd say it was worth it.

The Twilight Zone (2019) - Because it's more or less an anthology series, it has good and bad. If you're convinced you have to watch every episode, I would say it's not worth it. There is far more bad than good in this series. But if you are okay just hitting the highlights, I'd recommend Nightmare at 30,000 Feet, Six Degrees of Freedom, Blurryman (if you're okay with a cool concept that doesn't get its full payoff), Meet in the Middle (if you're okay with an episode that feels like Black Mirror instead of The Twilight Zone), The Who Of You, Among the Untrodden, and A Small Town.

Veronica Mars - I haven't seen the movie, but I quite enjoyed Season 4. I liked it better than Season 3, at least. However, your mileage for this one will vary entirely on how you feel about a certain character because that character is done dirty in the finale. So if you're not the biggest fan of that character OR if the show eventually returns once more to give that ending a little more conclusiveness, then it's worth a watch for fans of the show. Otherwise, it's skippable."
Danger Mouse,"My fiancé *loves* Will & Grace and she absolutely hated the revival, same with Gilmore Girls."
Danger Mouse,"Leverage got revived somewhat recently.

Personally, I think the new episodes are still worth watching, even if I miss the older team dynamics."
Danger Mouse,"Will & Grace (And ""And Just Like That"" the SATC reboot) proved that some things are just better off left in the past."
Danger Mouse,"Ignore list: The X-Files, The Twilight Zone, and Heroes: Reborn.

Good: Dexter: New Blood (Except for the finale)"
Danger Mouse,Warrior about to top the list; if it counts?
Danger Mouse,"Gossip Girl - awful.

Melrose Place - awful, but pleasantly surprised by Ashlee Simpson.

The Connors - needs Roseanne. Sorry, not sorry."
Danger Mouse,Seasons 1-7 of Doctor Who were great other than that none
Danger Mouse,Dr Who for me and then the Equalizer are both great and were a long time coming.
Danger Mouse,"Twin Peaks is the one I would call a fine sequel, reboot, whatever it was, because it kept the vibe. The X-Files now, boy what absolute garbage"
Danger Mouse,Mad About You reboot stunk. It just ignores the original season finale. Has none of the energy of the OG series.
Danger Mouse,Ugh I keep meaning to finish it. I’ve enjoyed what I’ve seen so far.
Danger Mouse,**EPISODE 8**
Danger Mouse,The new Beavis and Butthead is utterly fantastic.  It might be better than it was originally.  Mike Judge fucking rules.  I cannot wait for King of the Hill to return.
Danger Mouse,">Girl Meets World - okay and nice to see the original cast, but doesn't live up to the original.  I enjoyed it well enough even though I wish it were better.

In *Girl*'s defense, it only ran for three seasons, whereas *Boy Meets World* was fortunate enough to get seven, and many of *Boy*'s best episodes were in its fourth and fifth seasons. If we compare *Girl* to only the first three seasons of *Boy*, it's a much closer comparison (although *Boy* still edges it out for sure). I'd like to think *Girl* could have reached even higher heights than it did if it kept going."
Danger Mouse,"I didn't include Community since it never really stopped.

They did six seasons in six years across two networks, with a showrunner blip in Season 4."
Danger Mouse,"I understand it's all opinions, but off the top of my head I'd put ""Lethal Inspection"", ""The Late Philip J. Fry"", ""Game of Tones"", ""Meanwhile"" up against anything from the Fox seasons."
Danger Mouse,The Late Philip J. Fry
Danger Mouse,I dunno. The X-Files continuation wrapped up nicely.
Danger Mouse,8 9 and 10 are light years ahead of 2 6 and 7
Danger Mouse,Yeah definitely not a reboot technically but a show that went through a lot of transformation.
Danger Mouse,"Lethal Inspection is one of the first I’d list for why I don’t think the Comedy Central episodes are good. I can hear an executive at Comedy Central saying “I don’t care if it feels forced and unearned, the audience likes the dead dog episode, make us another dead dog episode!”  Maybe it’s some sort of Andy Kaufman joke that I didn’t get, and they intentionally made a shitty episode and then slapped a sad song on to the end as a middle finger to that executive.  In that case I might have a little respect for it.  Otherwise, no.  Gross."
Danger Mouse,"Is easily the best Comedy Central episode, and slightly better than a mediocre Fox episode.  The average Comedy Central episode is a lot closer in quality to That Darn Katz, which makes A Leela of Her Own look pretty good in comparison."
Danger Mouse,"Also the Jordan Peele ""Twilight Zone"" was largely very good. People who think it was ""too political"" are ridiculous. The original TZ was incredibly political."
Danger Mouse,"Except for Darin Morgan's episode 'Mulder and Scully Meet the Were-Monster', most episodes of season 10 & 11 were boring and meandering, with none of the thrillers and mysteries of the original X-Files."
Danger Mouse,Didn't it end on a cliffhanger though?
Danger Mouse,"I thought it was pretty good.  Uneven, a few really good episodes.  The original was uneven too, but it lasted a long time and there were several really good/great episodes that are most remembered.  I thought it lived up to what the original did but couldn't live up to people's memories of the best half dozen episodes."
Danger Mouse,It did.
Danger Mouse,Well put. I’ve seen a lot of twilight zone and love it but I do think people don’t really remember a lot of episodes cause they just aren’t memorable. I will say I always saw Black Mirror as the updated Twilight Zone.
Danger Mouse,"Yeah, I agree. I think the show got/gets **way** too much hate. It was definitely the best 'reboot' since the days of Serling. If it were given more time to breath, I think it would have gone down as an unquestionably terrific show in and of its own right."
Danger Mouse,"Obligatory plug for the fantastic deep dive series Nick Knacks. Here's the Nick At Nite episode but the while series is worth checking out, especially if you're a fan of things like Defunct Land: https://youtu.be/hQrrLdVFkVA"
Danger Mouse,It was probably just SMPTE color bars at that time of those early morning hours.  AKA the thing I would wake up to in the morning after falling asleep on the couch watching TV.
Danger Mouse,"Based on [this](http://rugratonline.free.fr/nick20b.html)

Probably *Double Dare* and *Monkees*

But, why"

Danger Mouse,"My favorite show was Today's Special weekday mornings.  And then the ""Special Delivery"" programming on the weekends."
Danger Mouse,In the early 90s it was paid programming at some point. Source: was an insomniac little kid in the early 90s
Danger Mouse,"wul, hold on there, brother"
Danger Mouse,"Space ghost coast to coast was a god send

Bananas in Pyjamas,"fwiw - my office trash can is unlined

knowing this i would take a banana to a kitchen garbage can

the few disgusting people who put their wet stuff into their unlined can are rewarded with a liner going forward."
Bananas in Pyjamas,"If it's primarily paper and other dry office type trash that gets emptied daily, why bother with a liner? I'd wager the break room has a liner but under desk? Probably not."
Bananas in Pyjamas,"Psh... wait until you notice all the unclosed doors people leave open in shows.

Like, front doors, just left wide open.

It's not about the liners, people, IT'S ABOUT THE DOORS!"
Bananas in Pyjamas,It's normal for office trash cans to not be lined.
Bananas in Pyjamas,The Wire is literally unwatchable because of this.
Bananas in Pyjamas,Have you ever worked in an office?
Bananas in Pyjamas,My peeve? When characters brush their teeth without toothpaste.
Bananas in Pyjamas,The worst is how people park. Their cars are usually at an angle and horribly spaced around the lines. Or they just park on the middle of the street.
Bananas in Pyjamas,You throw gross food in the kitchen can. Not complicated.
Bananas in Pyjamas,"If I was a professional prop garbage bag designer, I would design a prop liner that is a tasteful bag that sits cleanly just inside the rim and adheres to the inner wall.  That way the bin looks lined but there’s no messy bag sticking out the top"
Bananas in Pyjamas,If they're rewarded for their behavior then... might as well line all the trash cans
Bananas in Pyjamas,"You don't eat at your desk? A lot of offices don't really have a break room or typical sitting area, plus some just eat at their desk while working even if they have a break"
Bananas in Pyjamas,"No way. Most office trash cans have a super cheap, super thin, absolutely terrible plastic liner that tears the second anything heavier than an apple gets tossed in. It's pretty worthless as a liner but it's there. And the building's janitorial services team often puts extra liners in the bottom of the can."
Bananas in Pyjamas,So... just like real life
Bananas in Pyjamas,"a lot of extra time for cleaning people

also the environmental impact

my office tower likely has 5000+ desks and garbage cans -- all those bags add up"
Bananas in Pyjamas,"I make it a point not to leave food waste in my desk trashcan because if I didn't, I would have to empty it just about every day depending on what was thrown away."
Bananas in Pyjamas,Get over yourself
Bananas in Pyjamas,"That was my thought, too, OP. Line ya damn cans."
Bananas in Pyjamas,Crazy. I wonder if it's a regional thing? Where I am that's not normal at all.
Bananas in Pyjamas,"""Tearable""

&#x200B;

T,ftfy."
Bananas in Pyjamas,Lost
Bananas in Pyjamas,Justified. Raylan sitting at the table with Peter Greenes character perfectly set up who Raylan Givens was as a person. His code and just the man’s overall swagger.
Bananas in Pyjamas,"Looking back, I think that Futurama had an excellent opening scene. It really does a great job at setting up the humor and scifi hijinks that would continue throughout the show.  
  
I love the part right before the opening titles, as Fry wanders over to the window and looks at all of the flying cars. ""It's the future. My parents... my coworkers... my girlfriend... I'll never see any of them again... WAHOO!!!"""
Bananas in Pyjamas,"Deadwood’s opening scene (Bullock hanging the criminal) is one that always comes to mind when this question is asked 

There’s nothing overly special about it but it just perfectly sets the tone"
Bananas in Pyjamas,Mr Robot
Bananas in Pyjamas,"Twin Peaks. 'She's dead, wrapped in plastic' 

And then the Sheriff says... 'Where?'
... not 'Who?' Which I thought was brilliant writing, it makes you wonder if the sheriff was part of the murder."
Bananas in Pyjamas,Breaking Bad. The opening of him just absolutely breaking down on the roadside in his underwear with sirens in the background really set the tone for what the series would become.
Bananas in Pyjamas,The Americans. The use of Tusk was awesome.
Bananas in Pyjamas,The Leftovers.
Bananas in Pyjamas,"* Breaking Bad.
* Lost.
* The Good Place.
* The Walking Dead.
* The X-Files.
* Into the Night.
* Heroes.
* GoT.
* The Detour.
* Review."
Bananas in Pyjamas,westworld
Bananas in Pyjamas,"Honestly, Orphan Black is one of the only opening scenes I really remember that totally drew me in to the show. Normally it takes a few episodes. Westworld also had a great opening"
Bananas in Pyjamas,The Wire. The death of young Snot Boogie haunts me to this day.
Bananas in Pyjamas,The Newsroom coasted off of its opening scene for years. I like Sorkin but the show was not his most impressive work.
Bananas in Pyjamas,"Dexter, when he kills that child killer guy and the infamous line “tonight’s the night”."
Bananas in Pyjamas,"A show I don't think gets talked about much is Damages (2007)

The pilot starts with Rose Byrne covered in blood wearing just a jacket getting off an elevator and she's running on the street until she gets arrested. Gets you interested in the show right then and there."
Bananas in Pyjamas,Band of Brothers- opening with preparing for D-Day.
Bananas in Pyjamas,"not the greatest, but Iliked House of cards .

there is this (famous) thing in screenwriting where if you want to introduce a character that is to be liked right away, introduce him by saving a cat, and the audiance will like him from the start.

In House of cards they introduce the main character (in the opening scene if I remember correctly) directly by killing a dog..."

In less than 3 minutes you've introduced 5 main characters, spelled out how they all relate to each other, found out about the main conflict that drives the first series, and got in some absolutely solid gold hilarious dialogue that sets the scene for the show's whole style. It's a spectacularly well crafted piece of television."

Some Assembly Required,"""Assembly Required debuts on History Channel on Tuesday, February 23 at 10 p.m. ET/PT""  - For anyone that doesn't want to click and search the article."
Some Assembly Required,And when do Hitler and aliens come in?
Some Assembly Required,Lol at Tim Allen talking about be oppressed in Hollywood.
Some Assembly Required,"Tim Allen is a massive bag of shit. If you’re familiar with the Jim Jeffries “Just for Laughs” bit, Tim Allen is the rapey comedian he didn’t mention by name on the special. Allen also advocates for death penalty for drug dealers. Fun fact, he used to be a cocaine dealer in my home town. Caught at the airport with over a pound of blow. Proceeded to rat out numerous people (mostly his customers) that spent 30+ years in prison while he made shitty 90’s sitcoms."
Some Assembly Required,Maybe Tim can show us how to package a certain substance
Some Assembly Required,April Wilkerson's YouTube channel is Wilker Do's. I have known her and her family for years. And her DIY videos are really good.
Some Assembly Required,Wait I thought Al died
Some Assembly Required,Cool. How many episodes before there are aliens? It *is* the History Channel after all.
Some Assembly Required,"If there’s no Jonathan Taylor Thomas, what’s the point?"
Some Assembly Required,The fuck does this have to do with history? They’re just competing to see who can build something the fastest.
Some Assembly Required,An actual Tool Time show that features Tim Allen just grunting over tools? I will gladly pay for this $30/month subscription.
Some Assembly Required,"Between this and that really overt crossover in Last Man Standing I feel like they're going to start really pushing for a Home Improvement reboot.

I don't think it would survive today, though. Even the blandest 90s comedies are too racy for today."
Some Assembly Required,Am I going to watch this? I don’t think so Tim.
Some Assembly Required,So it's chopped but with wood working/diy skills??  Sounds awesome
Some Assembly Required,"Tim Allen is a fucking asshole...he’s demeaning, cruel and abusive to people."
Some Assembly Required,Isn’t Allen an asshole trump supporter?
Some Assembly Required,"it's not horrible, but I hate the google assistant product placement. the tool kit product placement is sort of bad too"
Some Assembly Required,"The construction aspect and having the builders on their home turf is pretty decent. The forced jokes, slow editing to prolong the awkward pause and lack of truly testing the builds needs to tighten up for it to continue. 

I mean, you have two contestants build a hot tub and you dont even bother to get in it for a test soak?

The product placements are rough but I get it when it comes to financing the show so whatever. I did appreciate the manufactured drama being minimalized. I dont care about oh no I'm out of time something just conveniently broke with 15 minutes to go but I pulled it off, or I'm missing my family etc. just show me the build and the process. The sabotage is a nice angle as it's often a quick fix but tests the builder's problem solving skills."
Some Assembly Required,Just a reminder that Tim Allen is a snitch.
Some Assembly Required,Boring
Some Assembly Required,Last Man standing was pretty okay until Tim starting using it as a soapbox to talk about how oppressed Conservatives are.

Some Assembly Required,"I have never seen this show, but this idea piqued my interest so I turned this episode on...Holy shit this show is awful. The tool man nostalgia in this episode is enjoyable, but wow. 9 seasons? Really?"
Some Assembly Required,"I don’t think so, Tim."
Some Assembly Required,Debbe Dunning's Heidi >>>>>>>>>
Some Assembly Required,"Even crazier, Tim Allen at one point had the #1 show, the #1 movie and the #1 book, at the SAME TIME."
Some Assembly Required,"It was pretty much the Full House of the mid 90s, so essentially half of American families tuned in."
Some Assembly Required,"> I found out there was a time where Home Improvement was the number 1 show on TV for a while

Not only that, it trounced Seinfeld in the ratings when they went head-to-head."
Some Assembly Required,I’d watch it every evening after dinner. Loved it. Came after married with children.
Some Assembly Required,"There were a few weeks in 1994-1995 where Tim Allen had the number one show, movie, and book all at the same time."
Some Assembly Required,"Wow...you put Home Improvement on the same level as George Lopez.. one is a long running prime time network show and one was a short running like basic cable show... 

Home Improvement was huge and the kids were very popular also. Tim Allen was also in a ton of movies during this time."
Some Assembly Required,Meh.  Fuck these Trump-supporting idiots.
Some Assembly Required,Jesus...10 PM on a Tuesday? Are they wanting this to fail?
Some Assembly Required,This ^ guy gets it. Thanks!!
Some Assembly Required,That's at the end when you find out that everything they built is secretly a nazi occult device to summon aliens...or it could just be a big jacuzzi...but it's probably nazi aliens.
Some Assembly Required,"I don't think so, Tim."
Some Assembly Required,20 years ago when Republicans in Hollywood organized they had to create a private group called The friends of Abe. It's still a private because the minute anybody even mentions that they might be center-right they get ostracized. And that has been going on for years.
Some Assembly Required,"He did what 99% of people, including you, would've done in that situation."
Some Assembly Required,"Late Canadian comedian Mike MacDonald let out a ""secret"" to an interviewer that Tim Allen is a complete dick."
Some Assembly Required,The fuck would he know about it? He got caught.
Some Assembly Required,I love her videos. Her Instagram is cool too.
Some Assembly Required,"She deserves it but what's crazy is when you look at similar channels they seem to maintain the status quo, but she went from a basement to owning a giant facility with hundreds of thousands of dollars in equipment. Does youtube money pay that well?"
Some Assembly Required,Oh fuck lmao that was Billy Mays
Some Assembly Required,First off to Oak Island
Some Assembly Required,About as much as most of the stuff on History these days.
Some Assembly Required,"Was he? He's a conservative, but don't know if he supported Trump. Seems like he doesn't now at least. From his twitter:

>President Biden, in a inspiration and inclusive speech suggested walking in someone else’s shoes. Love the sentiment but I think he would run a great risk in getting a fungal infection if he walked in mine. Loved my hiking boots since YMCA camp in the 60’s. Got to let these go.

I don't think anyone still supporting Trump is going to call Biden the president, let alone say anything nice about him at this point."
Some Assembly Required,"A drug dealer.  Snitch just means - in theory - he realized the errors of his ways when confronted by the legal system, and cooperated with the police.

And it's not like he was selling weed out of his apartment, he was moving large quantities of cocaine."
Some Assembly Required,You'd snitch too if you got caught with 1.5lbs of cocaine and were looking at a life sentence.
Some Assembly Required,"I see this posted a lot. I don't like Tim Allen, but I also don't care that he once turned in a bunch of fellow drug dealers."
Some Assembly Required,[Word](https://youtu.be/fTxOPcI_j1c) [Son.](https://youtu.be/Z1PHZrtbsxg)
Some Assembly Required,Maybe focus on the fact that he's a racist piece of shit instead
Some Assembly Required,i fucking knew it would be this
Some Assembly Required,It was awesome. I loved it. Go catch it on Hulu.
Some Assembly Required,"Seasons 2-6 of Last Man Standing are enjoyable. Seasons 7-9, including the episode you saw, are awful. Unwatchable. The pacing, acting, continuity, and jokes fell off a cliff. I would give the prime seasons a chance. Tim, the daughters, and supporting cast were all quite funny."
Some Assembly Required,Aged way better too
Some Assembly Required,"Tim Allen, Bob Saget, Drew Carey, Andrew Dice Clay, Dennis Leary . . . The nineties were *really* kind to a certain breed of raunchy, but not really *threatening* or status-quo breaking, comedians."
Some Assembly Required,Don't Stand Too Close To A Naked Man and The Santa Clause?
Some Assembly Required,That's some Michael Crichton shit!
Some Assembly Required,He's also been the lead in a perfect movie. Not many of those.
Some Assembly Required,"I wouldn't say it was quite as campy as Full House, but yeah Home Improvement was huge during it's heyday. I loved it as a kid and it surprisingly holds up pretty well especially when compared to other family friendly sitcoms from that era."
Some Assembly Required,"It was more like the Modern Family of the mid-90s.  Aimed at the entire family, some kid stuff, some adult stuff, something for everyone."
Some Assembly Required,To the point where Seinfeld was moved to a different time slot
Some Assembly Required,90% of magazines had Jonathan Taylor Thomas on the cover.
Some Assembly Required,"Eh. I think you're just making assumptions. Even Trump got too crazy for Allen. Allen is a ""classic"" conservative fiscally, but pretty progressive as far as the individual goes."
Some Assembly Required,Richard Karn too??
Some Assembly Required,"Wholeheartedly agree, and that’s the audience they are looking for."
Some Assembly Required,Get ready for his rant that no one is watching it because of a liberal conspiracy against him.
Some Assembly Required,"You support Trump, you get what you get and I don't have any sympathy for you. That being said, Hollywood discriminates over much more petty shit than politics. I'm pretty sure anyone who isn't a Democrat-supporting lefty (or at least politically agnostic) is going to have a hard go of it out there."
Some Assembly Required,"Yes, Arnold Schwarzenegger had to be all covert about his running for governor or he wouldn't be allowed in LA, they'd throw him out."
Some Assembly Required,"Saying shitty things and then having people say ""Hey, that's shitty!"" is not being ostracized."
Some Assembly Required,Advocate for the death of people who commit the same crimes as you did?
Some Assembly Required,"Mike .. wow that's a comic whose name I hadn't heard in years. Probably on account of being dead.

Was a funny guy though."
Some Assembly Required,I've never asked her. It's none of my business. I'm pretty sure some of it is from DIY work she does for others.
Some Assembly Required,"I can't seem to figure any quotes about him supporting Trump. In fact, other than feeling ostracized for being a Republican, I don't see him saying anything political at all.

I could be wrong."
Some Assembly Required,Realized the error of his ways or realized he would spend more time in jail if he didnt snitch?
Some Assembly Required,"To be fair, I wouldn't get caught with 1.5 lbs of cocaine."
Some Assembly Required,"Not only do I not care, I agree with him. Other people gonna get rich because I do a life sentence? Fuck that."
Some Assembly Required,And it's really hard to judge him not knowing the full context. There's about a million contributing factors that could make his actions better or worse.
Some Assembly Required,"Bob Saget is so interesting to me. I first saw him as Danny Tanner on *Full House* and as the host of *America's Funniest Home Videos*. From those, you expect him to be very straight-laced and boring - until you watch his stand-up for the first time and realize, ""Oh, this dude is as filthy as the rest of us.""

I'm mostly impressed at how well he was able to hide that from most of America."
Some Assembly Required,Bingo
Some Assembly Required,"Yeah it was one of those shows that nobody really liked, but you just watched it. It was good for a weekday laugh and there was usually a good physical comedy bit in every episode."
Some Assembly Required,"He has to play the ""fiscally conservative, socially liberal"" game to keep working. There's nothing wrong with being a Trump supporter. 96 percent negative media coverage and y'all fall for it hook line and sinker. Relax."
Some Assembly Required,Yes.
Some Assembly Required,"Counter argument: lots of republicans/conservative actors have successful careers.

It’s only when they become Trump worshipers that they start seeing backlash, and that’s mostly because they’re spewing conspiracy theories and other nonsense."
Some Assembly Required,Hey Arnold is essentially is liberal Republican and I never said there weren't exceptions to the rule because Clint Eastwood is also Republican but that dude has years of street cred.
Some Assembly Required,"No no no, see, freedom of speech means I can’t be ridiculed!"
Oh No! Its an Alien Invasion,"Somewhat unpopular opinion, but I loved the alien abduction element of S2. Sure, it didn't go anywhere in the end, but it made for some entertaining TV.

That said, that was the last season I watched in full."
Oh No! Its an Alien Invasion,"An alien & a vampire making out while getting blitzed on pills. This poster has a level of internet edgelord desperation I didn't know existed.

  


Congrats Ryan Murphy ya' did it!"
Oh No! Its an Alien Invasion,"I really liked Murder House, and Hotel, there were a few 'meh' seasons...but Roanoake, Cult and Apocalypse shit the bed so hard...so here's hoping this is their comeback season!"
Oh No! Its an Alien Invasion,"If the storyline does involve aliens, I hope it picks up some of the narrative from Asylum. I particularly would like to know what the children are up to."
Oh No! Its an Alien Invasion,This show is fun but I desperately want Murphy to make scream queens season 3
Oh No! Its an Alien Invasion,Alien Invasion themed and 'Double Feature'? Sounds like we're getting some Rocky Horror references this season.
Oh No! Its an Alien Invasion,Aliens coming back to earth like 8 seasons later just to make out with evil mermaids & do designer drugs is the only thing that can save 2021 for me 🤡👽💪 let's goooooo
Oh No! Its an Alien Invasion,"Murder House and Coven were the best seasons.  Everything else is campy garbage with too much going on without a solid mystery hook that solves itself in the end- you know, the whole backbone to a horror story."
Oh No! Its an Alien Invasion,This show is still on?  I honestly thought it died a few years ago.
Oh No! Its an Alien Invasion,Hy that I uiiii pop
Oh No! Its an Alien Invasion,"I haven't seen this show since the second season . I know it's an anthology but do I need to watch the other seasons or can I jump directly into this 

Like is there an overriding thread that binds all the seasons together ??"
Oh No! Its an Alien Invasion,"Seeing the words ""alien invasion"" for American Horror Story make me so sad or so excited. 

Poor Kit. He thought those kids were a miracle but now it's sounding like maybe they're part of the invasion. 

Of course knowing this show they may be a long term play by a rival faction of aliens that prevents or defeats an invasion."
Oh No! Its an Alien Invasion,I believe that is a siren/mermaid based on the teasers so far
Oh No! Its an Alien Invasion,The season is already confirmed to have nothing to do with vampires.
Oh No! Its an Alien Invasion,The poster instantly reminded me of [this](https://giphy.com/gifs/doompatrol-weird-makeout-roach-Jt4O9jaR4QzjhxXkl1).
Oh No! Its an Alien Invasion,"This is just your typical Ryan Murphy joint. There will be plenty of other random, stupid shit besides only aliens and vampires. AHS is all the horror sub genres all the time."
Oh No! Its an Alien Invasion,It's a [black pill...](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Black%20Pilled)
Oh No! Its an Alien Invasion,"I like Roanoke, especially the 2nd half. It felt the most like real horror in a while as opposed to an over the top drama with horror themed characters."
Oh No! Its an Alien Invasion,I love how divided we all are on Roanoke and Cult lol. Like they're two of my favourite seasons but when other fans say they hate them I absolutely see why even though I loved them. That said we fully agree on Apocalypse lmao. So many pretty set pieces and fun scene ideas that went nowhere and really felt like they were throwing those shitty bedsheets at the wall to see what stuck. 💀🤡 I still love all the memes that season resulted in though.
Oh No! Its an Alien Invasion,Murder house was groundbreaking
Oh No! Its an Alien Invasion,"The second story (the aliens one) is set in the 50s/60s, with JFK, Jackie and Marilyn playing an important role. The timeline matches the Asylum setting, so we’ll probably get to know more about the aliens’ deal, yeah."
Oh No! Its an Alien Invasion,"Not only is it still on but it's been renewed through at least season 13, and the spinoff American Horror Stories premieres next month."
Oh No! Its an Alien Invasion,It’s currently FX’s most successful show.
Oh No! Its an Alien Invasion,"Ah, the classic /r/television thread comment."
Oh No! Its an Alien Invasion,"Hmm the coven season (season 3) is IMO their best season and really should be watched. 

But I would say no. The only season that is a direct sequel to a season is apocalypse which is a sequel to Coven/Murder house

I would say you could probably jump in and not miss anything. But do yourself a favor and watch Coven. It is amazing"
Oh No! Its an Alien Invasion,"I hope so, I'm kinda tired of ghosts and vampires. Murder house and Hotel were awesome, but they've now basically done Murder House like 4 times now... and it's getting old"
Oh No! Its an Alien Invasion,[deleted]
Oh No! Its an Alien Invasion,">It felt the most like real horror in a while as opposed to an over the top drama with horror themed characters.

Exactly why I liked Roanoake"
Oh No! Its an Alien Invasion,"I definitely get how you feel on that, personally it just... felt too cluttered of a season so it was kinda hard to  parse"
Oh No! Its an Alien Invasion,That’s what they’re calling the spin-off? Reminds me of the Alien franchise
Oh No! Its an Alien Invasion,"Wow, surprised to hear that!  I think the carnival one was the last one I remember hearing about.

Thanks for the response instead of the randos who just downvote randomly."
Oh No! Its an Alien Invasion,"I don't doubt you, I'm just saying in the cultural zeitgeist of my life I hadn't heard anything about this show in years and was surprised it was still on."
Oh No! Its an Alien Invasion,Considering this is an AHS post I’m surprised no one has commented something along the lines of “can’t wait for this one to start out great and then turn into a massive shitshow” yet
Oh No! Its an Alien Invasion,First 2 seasons were the best.
Oh No! Its an Alien Invasion,Doom Patrol. A great series. Highly recommend it.
Oh No! Its an Alien Invasion,IIRC the spin-off is more stand alone episodes instead of a season long story. Almost like a twilight zone style anthology.
Oh No! Its an Alien Invasion,"Fans of the show being overtly defensive, and I say that as a fan myself. I hate the Freakshow season and I've never been able to put my finger on why. I loved the seasons that followed it though. Since the show has a fresh theme every season and the speculation and theorizing among fans are half the fun, the show makes each season reveal and promotional buildup feel like an actual event that goes beyond the show itself. I think that's why the fandom is so devoted and intense lol."
Oh No! Its an Alien Invasion,"I don’t know how old you are, but I believe it’s still pretty popular with a younger demographic. Also, just because your friends or Reddit don’t talk about it, doesn’t mean it’s not popular outside of those bubbles."
Oh No! Its an Alien Invasion,This show doesn't even start out great anymore. They jump right into the batshit insanity almost immediately now.
Oh No! Its an Alien Invasion,"Yep. Although it seems a lot of these are extensions of existing AHS plots, which is fine but I do hope they branch out into totally new territory more than revisiting the past."
Oh No! Its an Alien Invasion,"I appreciate you recognizing how defensive these fans are being.  I didn't mean to trash the show, just a genuine response that I would have bet money that show hadn't been made in years.

I admit though I was defensive over Orphan Black.  Despite the impossible to follow storyline I loved that show.

And the fessh theme is a cool idea no doubt, its what had me watch AHS for a time."
Oh No! Its an Alien Invasion,Yes I'm aware that things exist outside my bubble.  Soccer is very popular and yet I have no interest in it.  Thanks for your contribution.
Oh No! Its an Alien Invasion,I disagree. Last season was pretty good if you ask me. It knew exactly what it wanted to be (a campy slasher) and sticked to it all the way through.
Oh No! Its an Alien Invasion,I imagine even if it starts with them doing retreads eventually they will find their footing
Oh No! Its an Alien Invasion,"From plot leaks and stuff on the AHS sub, I think the first two episodes are a two-parter revisiting an old season, and the third episode also follows a past season, then the last four episodes of season one will be wholly new/original pieces, so I think they're doing an even blend of both honestly."
Oh No! Its an Alien Invasion,Just like your contribution added so much to this discussion.
Oh No! Its an Alien Invasion,Don’t get mad at him because you’re out of the loop and speaking on it as if you were in it.
Oh No! Its an Alien Invasion,"I stopped watching all of the Discovery Network channels in the late 2000’s when the tag lines all switched to be the antithesis of the namesakes

History: Made Every Day
Animal Planet: Surprisingly Human
Discovery: Grab Life by the Globe

I remember when Discovery used to be synonymous with high quality educational content. Even some of the early reality shows were educational and entertaining. Then they kept on adding more, and getting lower in value and quality. A modern tragedy."
Oh No! Its an Alien Invasion,Every episode asks rhetorical questions like “Is this toy an alien prototype???” And “Did the Egyptians invent interstellar travel???”… Obvs the answer is NO. But they just leave it open ended to seem cryptic.
Oh No! Its an Alien Invasion,"At least its not The Curse of Oak Island, 10 seasons of digging holes on a tiny island and finding nothing."
Oh No! Its an Alien Invasion,"The so-called ""History"" Channel is a symptom of a serious and very dangerous phenomena.  Whether we can survive our own gullibility, ignorance and lack of rationality is in grave doubt."
Oh No! Its an Alien Invasion,"Stargate is the better ancient aliens. A concept so absurd it belongs in science fiction, and the setting allowed for some amazing story telling."
Oh No! Its an Alien Invasion,It would be a much better show if it just focused on unexplainable archeological finds and not attribute them to aliens with 0 evidence.
Oh No! Its an Alien Invasion,It would be much more better for humanity to make docs about how good ancient people were at mathematics and how they applied it. Like ancient Egypt maths was huge part of the religion and philosophy in really cool ways with architecture to symbolism in art. You can defo find experts with charm and excitement to make it engaging. But that doesn’t make the ad revenue and would mean hiring a good research dept. There are defo ways to make that type of show exciting and inspire but it requires more effort. So they make the cheapest show.
Oh No! Its an Alien Invasion,"People say Ancient Aliens is racist because it's white guys claiming ancient Egyptians were too stupid to build the pyramids without alien help. But those people must not have watched up to the part where they also say aliens are the only way ancient Vikings could have built... boats. Actual brain damage.

That or else they're fraudsters, which founding member Erich von Däniken in his youth was actually convicted of. He wrote one of his books from prison. The more you know."
Oh No! Its an Alien Invasion,"It’s very “I couldn’t have come up with that, so obviously no one else could have either.” Some people have a hard time understanding that anyone else in the world might be smarter or more creative than them."
Oh No! Its an Alien Invasion,I think it was cool first couple episodes then you realized… wait they just ran out of material so any achievement… aliens. wtf.
Oh No! Its an Alien Invasion,"probably too young to remember ""In Search Of"" with Leonard Nimoy.

it was popular...(loch ness, big foot, aliens, etc)

In 1972, an edited version of the film appeared as a TV documentary called In Search of Ancient Astronauts on NBC and was produced by Alan Landsburg Productions. The documentary was narrated by Rod Serling.\[26\] A follow-up called In Search of Ancient Mysteries aired the following year, also narrated by Serling.\[27\]\[28\] **The documentary series In Search Of..., which Leonard Nimoy hosted (Serling having died in 1975), was premiered on the basis of those two ""pilot"" films.**  


even been rebooted with the new Spock

Documentary series hosted by Zachary Quinto based on the 1970s series that examined unexplained phenomena from all over the world."
Oh No! Its an Alien Invasion,"Stargate sg-1 is better at this without presenting itself as ""true"""
Oh No! Its an Alien Invasion,"I find stuff like that pretty quaint when contrasted to some or the more toxic paranoias that float around in society these days.

But what does bother me is that the Ancient Aliens videos get like 50 million views on places like YT and the videos debunking them get like 500,000 if they're lucky. 

And those are so much more fascinating. 

The real story is almost always more interesting than the fantasy one because there's so many more reasons why things are the way they are than you can fit in such reductive little ideas.

Like 'out of place artifacts'? The interesting part is discovering why they exist. Antithykera (sp?) mechanism, Voynich manuscript? Those things are fascinating because we're on a quest to learn the real story, not half-ass it and come up with fictional stories."
Oh No! Its an Alien Invasion,I absolutely adore the show it's so ridiculous that it becomes fun to watch.
Oh No! Its an Alien Invasion,"They don’t 100% believe what they are saying.  They believe if they sell it hard enough they will make money, and they have the ratings and paychecks to back that belief up.

If you don’t support this grift than don’t watch it, but it’s pure fictional entertainment dressed up to sound like honest scientific speculation."
Oh No! Its an Alien Invasion,"Wait is that show still fucking making new episodes? 

I remember watching it in 2012 or 13 when it first started and they were scraping the bottom of the barrel for content like 10 episodes in. 

Wtf do they even talk about now?"
Oh No! Its an Alien Invasion,Man there's a YouTube video where a dude watches all of them and he essentially creates like the world's history as it happened according to ancient aliens and humans have apparently not been responsible for any of the achievements we've done lmao its an absurd video.
Oh No! Its an Alien Invasion,But what if and I know this is crazy the aliens made  you stop watching the show because we were all getting to close to the truth. It turns out the aliens are working with the president like maybe the grays??????????
Oh No! Its an Alien Invasion,">Now, you may say ""Oh, don't take it so seriously. These people aren't serious who made it"". Except they are. They 100% believe in what they're saying.

Ehhh...."
Oh No! Its an Alien Invasion,The narration by Robert Clotworthy is legendary though. He narrates Oak Island as well.
Oh No! Its an Alien Invasion,"Once I caught my father watching this. ""Is this for real?"", he asked me. ""Well, it's called Ancient *Aliens*, so you can figure it out yourself"".

I think that's where I lost my inheritance."
Oh No! Its an Alien Invasion,Ancient alien theorists say…
Oh No! Its an Alien Invasion,"Some comedian or meme or something summed up ancient aliens as: could brown people do this? Nah, aliens."
Oh No! Its an Alien Invasion,so what you're saying is it was written by aliens?
Oh No! Its an Alien Invasion,Ancient alien theorists suggest that >!Insert bullshit here.!< Its all I ever hear in this show.
Oh No! Its an Alien Invasion,"It night be insult to *intelligent* human beings, but c'mon, those kind of people are very uncommon. The average person is a complete moron. Companies would be stupid not to take their money.

Never forget that that half of my country thinks a trust fund baby that hosts a reality television show (a known, proven sex offender and rapist) is the now the arbiter of all truth. The same people thought a man who literally set a world record for number of lies told in public is trustworthy enough to be leader of the free world. 

Ancient aliens may be dumb, but it's only because dumb people pay for content too.  Don't blame the people who produce this stuff, blame the people who consume it. Blame the people who consistently rally against funding education. This market wouldn't be worth so much money if we inoculated people against this kind of garbage with education."
Oh No! Its an Alien Invasion,true but I love it
Oh No! Its an Alien Invasion,Ancient alien theorists disagree
Oh No! Its an Alien Invasion,"I kinda like it.

It's like a church sermon, but far more entertaining, and with less hate for non-believers."
Oh No! Its an Alien Invasion,"The show is based on the book ""Chariot of the gods""

if you want a solid reason to avoid it, the usage of the word ""savage"" as a description of the African people is a decent one.   


Its filled with the authors own interpretations of things, it says that the savages could not possibly have built the pyramids and etc. Its mostly just structured ramblings"
Oh No! Its an Alien Invasion,"I used to watching dumb conspiracy shows years ago, back when Alex Jones was yelling at buildings in Houston because it looked like an Owl and thus was where the Illumanti were stations. Ancient Aliens peaked my interest because I remember seeing the Pilot and how incredibly dumb it was. I kept up with the show for a long time due to how they could connect everything to Aliens with any thread. Some of your examples aren't even the dumber ones. Bigfoot and other cryptids? We're suddenly a Prison Planet for dangerous animals/criminals that don't belong on most other worlds. Nazis? They clearly had some kind of super weapon like ""Die Glocke"". Those weird shape stone carvings in India? Clearly some kind of Power Planet and certainly not a certain aspect of Shiva.

However the biggest problem with Ancient Aliens is how much of a fraud the show and the talking heads really are. They use Misleading information at best and downright dishonesty at worst. There's loads of examples on Jason Colavito's Website as well as the Ancient Aliens Debunked Video on Youtube (Though that is written with a heavy Christian/Creationist Bias also, but that's only really a issue in the last quarter of that video), but to list a couple of the biggest from the top of my head:

They claim that Puma Punku cannot be made because the stones used are stones like Granite and others would have been too hard to cut, so they must have used Alien Technology to Laser Cut and then float them in place. However not only are the stones infact Andesite and Diorite (which are much more softer), but there are many unfinished stones on the site that show how they're cut AND the systems used to put in place.

They also claim that the Moai of Easter Island have to be floated by Aliens because they were too heavy. The claim here is that there are no real Trees on Easter Island, so they cannot use Wooden Rollers. Not only do they not take into account that the Moai aren't just the heads, but the fact that Easter Island was probably full of trees at one point and that the Moai are sinking due to Soil Erosion, which can happen if you remove many trees where there used to be. Easter Island infact has some of the worst soil erosion known.

They also keep referencing the work of Zacharia Sitchin also. A man who claimed he translated Ancient Sumerian. If you ever hear about the whole Planet Niberu, let alone the whole 'Atmosphere of Gold' and such like, that never was a thing. He just made it all up. Yet people to this day believe it was part of any Mesopotamian cultures and parrot it. Not only that, but pretty much any information Ancient Aliens says about the Anunnaki is pretty much flat out wrong also. Most Sumerian scholars state the translation for the name 'Anunnaki' means 'The Children of Anu' or something like that. But Ancient Aliens uses the works of Zacharia Sitchin and claim it means 'Those from Heaven they came' or some nonsense like that.

""Now, you may say ""Oh, don't take it so seriously. These people aren't serious who made it"". Except they are. They 100% believe in what they're saying. It's nothing if not misleading about history at the very least.""

Some of them do, some of them don't. Some, like David Childress (One of the 'Big Three' of Ancient Aliens), definitely flip flops going from believing, to calling  Erich von Däniken  a Fraud, to be being one of his fervent believers, generally going with the times and what is more profitable to him at the time. Ancient Aliens has probably been his longest ride and I think he 'joined them' as a 'skeptic' originally until he just went full on Ancient Astronaut theory.

I still watch it occasionally. If I need something in the background while eating or looking after something. However I find that I can be watching an entirely new episode, but they're parroting the same old clips and claims but in different orders because they had to resort to recycling content for newer episodes and seasons."
Oh No! Its an Alien Invasion,The History channel is helping dumb down society further.
Oh No! Its an Alien Invasion,"They are basically just another type of flat earther, some people have also taken this further and no longer believe in aliens but in Atlantis instead, or rather a global human civilization which existed 10s of thousands of years before any proof of human civilization in archeology but must have existed because there's no way the brown people could have actually invented  civilization on their own, and that the only possible way to explain ancient Egypt is that they secretly had power tools to cut stone."
Oh No! Its an Alien Invasion,"I used to like it when Bird Hair Indiana would go to archaeological sites and show neat features up close (funny side note in one of the episodes from the first couple of seasons, he  and his camera man were clearly part of a tour group and just wandered off on their own, It was somewhere in Peru I think) Now its just wonky bullshit, every time that Childress guy talks I just roll my eyes at his nonsense. They clearly ran out of material years ago and are just ridding the wave."
Oh No! Its an Alien Invasion,"The first 6 or so episodes of Ancient Aliens that comprise of its first season ( I think, it’s been a while ), are Actualy really good and entertaining if you switch your brain off for it and just enjoy the ride. It makes for a great doc series that investigates the classic ancient aliens stuff without going beyond the realms of ridiculous and asks some interesting questions. 

It’s everything else after that that’s an abomination. If they’d just left it as this interesting little 6 part doc series it may have retained some sort of interest. But It’s the fact they saw the first season do well and decided to make literally 100 more episodes that basically told us every historical event ever was Aliens, that totally ruined it. Yeti? Alien. George Washington? Alien.

Ruined itself by going off the deep end."
Oh No! Its an Alien Invasion,"Honestly I think it suffered from its own success. The original episodes were at least a little thought provoking, now they are grasping at straws to make connections and to keep people watching."
Oh No! Its an Alien Invasion,I mean how else you explain the Monalisa?
Oh No! Its an Alien Invasion,"I'll give you an idea of how serious i take ancient aliens, there's a guy with weird hair from it, he's a cross between a glue sniffer and a Centauri from babylon5, he embodies the idiocy of believing in the things they put out, he is a meme as well now"
Oh No! Its an Alien Invasion,Gotta watch it with Action Bronson
Oh No! Its an Alien Invasion,It's the fact the they are serious that makes it a 11/10 for me. You do you though.
Oh No! Its an Alien Invasion,"The underlying subtext of almost all of the “ancient aliens” theories about the truly ancient world (aztecs, Egyptians, Greeks etc) is “well obviously they couldn’t have done it, they’re brown people” - you rarely see ancient alien theories about Roman roads or aqueducts or other western European achievements - those were just civilised people so of course they could achieve awesome things. But the brown people a bit further south? No chance, must have been aliens"
Oh No! Its an Alien Invasion,"Not only is it stupid, it's promotes stupidity by asserting ""alternative facts"" for events and artifacts that have been explained long ago, making anyone who digests this show as having any semblance of knowledge dumber.

If you realize how much effort they put into making almost EVERY narrative a question, it's astounding. 

""Easter Island, was a home base to pre-cambrian aliens?""

""These stones were carved with technology that didn't exist yet?""

It's like they stole a legal playbook from Fox News."
Oh No! Its an Alien Invasion,"If you dip your toe into right wing media you'll see a lot of this type of pseudoscience mixed with religion and ancient history.  I used to listen to a lot of Coast to Coast AM which talked about this stuff a lot.  Most of it seems to be based off of Chariots of The Gods by Zacharia Sitchin.  
 
They do seem to believe this stuff.  They have conventions all around the world with the regular cast of characters. A lot of whom show up in Ancient Aliens like Linda Moulton-Howe and George Noory (host of Coast to Coast AM). It's an entire industry fed by books and paid appearances.

EDIT: Have the wrong author for Chariots of the Gods (Erich von Däniken).  Sitchin wrote 12th Planet which is built off of Chariots and is basically a bunch of scifi nonsense about aliens called the Annunaki from Nibiru genetically creating humans to mine gold."
Oh No! Its an Alien Invasion,"Could aliens have evolved on another planet, developed space travel earlier than us, and then visited our planet? Possibly.

Could those aliens have influenced our species / culture, either deliberately or inadvertently? Vaguely possible.

Did aliens cause our species’ development because we couldn’t possibly have done it naturally? If that’s the case… who caused the aliens’ development?!

I’m all for scientific questioning and consideration of alternative theories… but blaming everything you don’t understand on “space gods” isn’t the way."
Oh No! Its an Alien Invasion,I think Chris Rock had a bit about Ancient Aliens where white people refuse to believe black and brown people were able to build the pyramids so they just say it was Aliens.
Oh No! Its an Alien Invasion,I don't watch it for the history and I'm usually very stoned
Oh No! Its an Alien Invasion,"Lol it's a great show, in fact ancient astronaut theorists say yes."
Oh No! Its an Alien Invasion,"Yeah, I always hated that show too. It assumes that humans are helpless, stupid idiots who can't figure anything out for ourselves."
Oh No! Its an Alien Invasion,That show is great for when I want to get mad at the TV. Sorta the same reason people watch Jersey Shore I s’pose.
Oh No! Its an Alien Invasion,"It's not just an insult to humans it's specifically nazism. The ancient aliens theory was started by the Nazis. Partly it was to explain all the shit POC did that they refused to believe ""inferior"" non-whites could do. There was also a lot of crap about whites being descended in some way from these aliens who were believed to be very Nordic looking and therefore superior."
Oh No! Its an Alien Invasion,"It's worse than the ghost and supernatural hunter shows where they never find any ghosts, but they double down on belief. Or like the end times preppers shows. It's not really entertaining because they aren't joking."
Oh No! Its an Alien Invasion,I'm really struck by how commonly the assumption is that folks in not-Europe couldn't possibly have figured out how to do cool things.
Oh No! Its an Alien Invasion,It's awesome and funny as fuck if you know it's all nonsense going in.
"Pablo Escobar, el patron del mal","*Malparida...*

Anyway I really thought Season 3 was gonna be on Mexico since Paquita's from there, I guess they are gonna wrap up the top Colombian stories and saving up the mexican Cartels for the next season(s)."
"Pablo Escobar, el patron del mal",That could be interesting. I'll probably read it later today.
"Pablo Escobar, el patron del mal","Give a try to Pataal Lok, McMafia, The Family Man (all on Prime). Seeing your list, I have a feeling you'll like these."
"Pablo Escobar, el patron del mal","vouch for ZeroZeroZero the way the episodes are structured and shot were just incredible, really blew me away at points"
"Pablo Escobar, el patron del mal","I'd definitely recommend Der Pass (also known as Pagan Peak), despite being the latest foreign spin off of Broen Bron (this time being between Germany and Austria) its an incredibly well made, well written series that plays very cleverly with the source ideas and features a lot of the beautiful scenery of the alps."
"Pablo Escobar, el patron del mal","dude watch paatal lok, simply the best thing to come from indian web space. it's on prime. much much darker than sacred games."
"Pablo Escobar, el patron del mal",Babylon Berlin?
"Pablo Escobar, el patron del mal","I honestly haven't watched this one, but Cocaine Coast (2018) could be a another series in your list. It is a Spanish series set in the 80s about how tobacco smugglers in Galicia turned into narcos. It is also based on real events."
"Pablo Escobar, el patron del mal",The Chalet is a six-episode French mystery series on Netflix that's wonderfully suspenseful.
"Pablo Escobar, el patron del mal","Exellent list. And while it's not a crime show per se, but rather a spy thriller, I'd like to add [Le Bureau des Légendes](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4063800/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0), which is simply the best series French TV has produced in the past 20 years."
"Pablo Escobar, el patron del mal",Amazing. Thanks very much. Great suggestions on the thread as well.
"Pablo Escobar, el patron del mal",Try Broen / Broen or The Bridge on Hulu
"Pablo Escobar, el patron del mal",You should watch Hotel Beau Sejour
"Pablo Escobar, el patron del mal",My dad loved The Sniffer. The premise sounds ridiculous but he really enjoyed it.
"Pablo Escobar, el patron del mal","Thanks for the list! Will check out ZeroZeroZero and a few others, once I finish Money Heist."
"Pablo Escobar, el patron del mal",ZeroZeroZero is like if Gomorrah and McMafia had a baby.  I think you'll like McMafia very much.
"Pablo Escobar, el patron del mal","In addition to *Spiral (Engrenages)* which you mentioned, I also enjoyed:

* 1) *Varg Veum* - A (mostly) serious Norwegian crime show, but some light humor mixed in with it.

* 2) *Les Petits Meurtres d'Agatha Christie* (this is more of a light hearted, ""whodunit"" one, but I really like the humor and the cast, though fair warning, they do keep the sexism of the era in there, so you may find the main character a bit off putting at times, but that's kind of the point too). It is titled as *The Little Murders of Agatha Christie* in English. Almost forgot to mention it, but there are 2 separate shows under that name. I'm talking specifically Series 2, which is the one set in the 50s/60s. There's an earlier one with the same name in the 30s that I didn't get into. 
* 3) *Witnesses (Les Témoins)* - Another good, serious French show."
"Pablo Escobar, el patron del mal","GREAT list!!! 
Gomorrah is a top 3 for me. Can’t get enough of it. 
Completely agree on Suburra, zerozerozero, spiral, sacred games. 

As others said I highly recommend Pataal Lok and Der Pass. Two of the best shows by far I’ve watched this year."
"Pablo Escobar, el patron del mal","If you enjoy dirty cops, you might enjoy the film *Bad Lieutenant* with Harvey Keitel."
"Pablo Escobar, el patron del mal","Thanks for all the recommendations, I feel I might spend a lot of this month sat in front of a TV, well, slightly more than the previous two months."
"Pablo Escobar, el patron del mal","I loved Gomorrah, but I'm having trouble finding seasons 3 and 4 in the US. Does anyone know how/where I can watch it?"
"Pablo Escobar, el patron del mal","You should watch De Dag (The Day), its a 12 part series about a bank robbery. The odd numbers are from the perspective of the cops and the even numbers from the perspective of the robbers 

It's a german series i think, really liked it"
"Pablo Escobar, el patron del mal","McMafia was a really water-cooler show when it came out in the UK. Compelling series with James Norton as a fantastic lead.

Although, there is a lot of Russian and Hebrew dialogue - this is predominantly an English speaking show."
"Pablo Escobar, el patron del mal","This will be my next watch, sounds great."
"Pablo Escobar, el patron del mal",I really like the sound of this one.
"Pablo Escobar, el patron del mal","Good film, Keitel is brilliant in it."
"Pablo Escobar, el patron del mal","Yeah, other than torrents or kodi, you might struggle.

Unless its on the new HBO platform?"
"Pablo Escobar, el patron del mal","> McMafia 

Has the been any news on season 2? They renewed it and then nothing."
"Pablo Escobar, el patron del mal","I've tried kodi, but there's always an issue with the subtitles unfortunately"
"Pablo Escobar, el patron del mal","So, I guess their goal today was to take everyone who said D+ had no original content besides The Mandalorian, and pretty much punch them in the face repeatedly."
"Pablo Escobar, el patron del mal",Hooch is crazy
"Pablo Escobar, el patron del mal","Every official announcement/trailer.

"Pablo Escobar, el patron del mal",I thought this was wallstreebets DD for a second lol
"Pablo Escobar, el patron del mal","Nothing on any of the ""old"" Netflix series has me sad...  Nice write up, though."
"Pablo Escobar, el patron del mal",/u/arashtp you missed Percy Jackson.
"Pablo Escobar, el patron del mal",Super stoked on most of this. I’m especially looking forward to the Nat geo content. Can you imagine if Disney+ dropped with half of these titles? Game changer
"Pablo Escobar, el patron del mal","Based on the release timelines of those shows, it looks like their strategy is: 

Zeitgeist show for 6 weeks -> 1 week of cool down —> couple weeks of hype up -> next Zeitgeist show -> Repeat"
"Pablo Escobar, el patron del mal",They're really going all out with the High Republic.
"Pablo Escobar, el patron del mal",did She Hulk get a trailer or anything?
"Pablo Escobar, el patron del mal",that's a lot of content
"Pablo Escobar, el patron del mal","So strange to realize Ice Age is owned by Disney now. 

Also I’m sort of unexpectedly excited about the continuation of Mighty Ducks!"
"Pablo Escobar, el patron del mal",A Turner and Hooch reboot yyyeeeeessss!!! I've been a fan (we call ourselves Hoochers) for years and am flipping out right now!!!!
"Pablo Escobar, el patron del mal",Missing rogue squadron on Star Wars
"Pablo Escobar, el patron del mal",Hocus Pocus 2. What.
"Pablo Escobar, el patron del mal","A lot of this is awesome, but can I just take a moment to appreciate *Sister Act 3*?"
"Pablo Escobar, el patron del mal",">Tiana is the first princess to have her own Walt Disney Animation Studios series

Just going to ignore the Little Mermaid and Tangled series apparently."
"Pablo Escobar, el patron del mal",[deleted]
"Pablo Escobar, el patron del mal",I have only read a hand full of moon knight comics but from what I have heard and read making a PG moon knight show is not going to go over well with fans.
"Pablo Escobar, el patron del mal",Any specific dates to go with this?
"Pablo Escobar, el patron del mal",You forgot the multiple tongue in cheek references to Matt Murdock.  Charlie Cox's Daredevil is officially part of the MCU now.  Hes apparently in She Hulk and Spider-Man 3.
"Pablo Escobar, el patron del mal","Damn, the Ducks end up becoming what they rebelled against..."
"Pablo Escobar, el patron del mal","As a bi dude I'm still waiting for literally anything big that features a non-straight dude. In film they ignored it almost completely out of fear of gay-hating countries banning it and them losing money (like China). 

Really hoping for something to come through, maybe with x-men back in the fold Iceman could get something"
"Pablo Escobar, el patron del mal",So is Ahsoka taking the place of the Rebels spinoff? Because thats what I was most excited for
"Pablo Escobar, el patron del mal",Disney is milking Star Wars and Marvel for everything dollar they can squeeze. There are way too many reboots and remakes. They need originally sourced content that has no reliance on existing IP. How about some original NON-Marvel/Star Wars scripted content? I think the Mandalorian is a cute show but I want to see ORIGINAL content for once. This slate of shows are not enough to keep all of their subscribers satisfied.
"Pablo Escobar, el patron del mal",I just want to have the spin off Thrawn and Ezra travels in space show.
"Pablo Escobar, el patron del mal","Hey, bozo, why didn't you mention It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia?

Great list, otherwise."
"Pablo Escobar, el patron del mal",so much content that post alone made me vomit .
"Pablo Escobar, el patron del mal",Seems like Star Wars's future is on TV.
"Pablo Escobar, el patron del mal",Is it weird that I'm most excited for the Josh Peck version of Turner and Hooch?
"Pablo Escobar, el patron del mal","Looks like they're updating Microcosmos with A Real Bug's Life, that should be cool as fuck."
"Pablo Escobar, el patron del mal",">The Mighty Ducks: Game Changers

>Lauren Graham (Gilmore Girls, Parenthood) and Emilio Estevez (reprising his role from the original feature films) star in the next chapter of the hit Mighty Ducks franchise, premiering in early 2021. In present day Minnesota, the Mighty Ducks have evolved from scrappy underdogs to an ultra-competitive, powerhouse youth hockey team. After 12-year-old Evan is unceremoniously cut from the Ducks, he and his mom Alex set out to build their own ragtag team of misfits to challenge the cutthroat, win-at-all-costs culture of competitive youth sports.

I hope Disney has been paying attn to Cobra Kai and takes all the good from it and applies it to the Ducks!!!"
"Pablo Escobar, el patron del mal","Man, Tony Stark cannot keep control of his tech, can he? Well, I guess he's dead, so that makes sense."
"Pablo Escobar, el patron del mal",The one thing I want from Marvel is an OG Nick Fury and the Howling Commandos show.
"Pablo Escobar, el patron del mal",They forgot Shadow Hunters.
"Pablo Escobar, el patron del mal",Disney+ launch was more like beta test to ensure their decision of allocating such resources to the platform
"Pablo Escobar, el patron del mal","The criticism was regarding lack of original screenplays, too. It's still true in that aspect."
"Pablo Escobar, el patron del mal","It's still lacks diversity, it's still marvel, star wars and Pixar animated pg-13 movies, still no new new IPs."
"Pablo Escobar, el patron del mal",[deleted]
"Pablo Escobar, el patron del mal","If they don't have Phill Lewis playing the dog using mocap, they dun goofed."
"Pablo Escobar, el patron del mal",*holds up lighter*
"Pablo Escobar, el patron del mal",Thanks man you're awesome
"Pablo Escobar, el patron del mal",[Rogue squadron](https://youtu.be/5bLkTjn6Y_s)
"Pablo Escobar, el patron del mal",Not enough 🚀🚀🚀
"Pablo Escobar, el patron del mal","Just hints at Daredevil, from Sony in Spider-Man 3 and at the reveal here today for She-Hulk."
"Pablo Escobar, el patron del mal","Yeah sounds like the Multiverse in SM3 will pull in Daredevil and Kingpin. Which could be great.

Daredevil was hinted at strongly for SheHulk, and there have been rumors that DNofrio has campaigned hard and they’ve taken him seriously as maybe using his character to put together the Sinister Six."
"Pablo Escobar, el patron del mal","There's a big hint in Hawkeye. Maya Lopez is a definitively Daredevil character (Echo, a deaf woman who can see something once and imitate it originally hired by Kingpin to take out Daredevil and eventually befriending him). She also wore the Ronin outfit for awhile that Hawkeye wore in Endgame after his family vanished (New Avengers comics).

Edit: why am I being downvoted for this?"
"Pablo Escobar, el patron del mal",And Swiss Family Robinson.
"Pablo Escobar, el patron del mal",It’s pretty genius
"Pablo Escobar, el patron del mal",Super into the Acolyte as I’d really like to see what the Sith/dark side users were up to during this time period
"Pablo Escobar, el patron del mal","No, but they confirmed Tatiana Maslany."
"Pablo Escobar, el patron del mal",Tim Roth will be back as Abomination and Mark Ruffalo.
"Pablo Escobar, el patron del mal",Its a rather deceptive line if your not in the know.  WDAS is the movie studio. Disney Television Animation is the studio that typically handles the TV side (they were the ones that made the Tangled series).
"Pablo Escobar, el patron del mal",That's not necessarily a bad thing tbh. It's how they execute it that matters. GOTG was kinda considered a bottom of the barrel IP for marvel before they made it and it turned out well.
"Pablo Escobar, el patron del mal","There’s like 70 announced shows here and less than 10 are actual original ideas. Really disappointing *in my opinion*.

I get people like Star Wars and stuff, but it seems extreme to me."
"Pablo Escobar, el patron del mal","I think it could be done. For me at least the fun part is the mind-bendy unreliable narrator stuff and not the graphic violence. Although there is something to be said for when other characters meet Moon Knight and are like, ""oh this guy is *crazy* crazy and not just *Batman* crazy."""
"Pablo Escobar, el patron del mal","This didn’t mention any of the Marvel movies since it’s still not certain whether they’ll be released in theaters first or on Disney+ at the same time, but The Eternals is set to have their first openly gay main character whenever that’s released.

If you haven’t watched the Disney+ short film Out, you absolutely should."
"Pablo Escobar, el patron del mal","Young Avengers is just over the horizon, and that comes with the most prominent gay couple in marvel. Still a few years out though."
"Pablo Escobar, el patron del mal",Not sure if it is 100% confirmed but I remember seeing somewhere that Valkyrie is looking for a wife in the next Thor movie.
"Pablo Escobar, el patron del mal","As a fellow homo, I'm sorry you're getting downvoted, but that's r/television for you. I've learned not to bring up representation issues on this sub anymore."
"Pablo Escobar, el patron del mal","I would bet it will be in a team, or they will reveal the character is gay in a sequel...that way people in China will already be invested.  Because you’re right....they want that China money badly. 


Wouldn’t it be a kick in the nuts to China if the wait until like Shang Chi 3 and reveal he was gay the whole time! Lmao. That could literally start a war!!"
"Pablo Escobar, el patron del mal","I feel like this'll be a big part of the Ashoka show, considering that she was still searching when we see her in The Mandolorian."
"Pablo Escobar, el patron del mal",Thats not on Disney+ you 1 star fool.
"Pablo Escobar, el patron del mal",That’s pathetic
"Pablo Escobar, el patron del mal",I really don't like the sound of this. The whole point of the Ducks is that they are scrappy underdogs. Having them become what they played against feels kind of weird. And it's obviously gonna end with both Ducks teams playing against each other. It just sounds weird to me.
"Pablo Escobar, el patron del mal","They're going all in because they've lost all profits from Disney parks and tourism, 75% of their revenue.

Also why they gutted ESPN"
"Pablo Escobar, el patron del mal","Certainly, but was anyone really expecting that? Aside from Pixar, Disney hasn't done an original story in... I'm not sure. Possibly ever."
"Pablo Escobar, el patron del mal",Pixar films are all new IPs lol
"Pablo Escobar, el patron del mal",[deleted]
"Pablo Escobar, el patron del mal",One Star Wars IP will drive more total interest than anything on HBO Max lmao
"Pablo Escobar, el patron del mal","Uh ""Win or Lose"" is a new IP."
Sense8,"If you don’t find value in the service then vote with your wallet and cancel. The only one that can answer your question is you. Because your opinions, financials and free time differ from everybody else."
Sense8,I subscribe and unsubscribe constantly to multiple streaming services. It's extremely easy and very little work. I legitimately do not understand why more people don't do it. Sub when you want to watch something. Unsub when you don't. Save your money.
Sense8,">Is it worth maintaining a subscription?

Does anyone really need to ""maintain"" something that you can cancel and subscribe whenever you want?"
Sense8,"What drives me crazy is that Netflix won't sell the rights to shows they cancel, so they have no chance of ever getting a finale season or movie. 

When Santa Clarita Diet was cancelled, Drew Barrymore tried to buy the rights to make the show under her own production company that was ALREADY co-producing the show. Netflix told her to get lost."
Sense8,"Since they raised the price to $20/mo in Canada we started rotating streaming services. It's working out really well.  The kids are excited for new content every month, and they vote for what one we get each month. 

There's a beauty in constraints."
Sense8,[deleted]
Sense8,"""Inventory of Broken Dreams"" absolutely sounds like a show that Netflix would greenlight and then cancel."
Sense8,"There's lots of good shows that have had many seasons or a good ending. Bojack Horseman, Stranger Things, Ozark, Never have I ever, Dark, Big Mouth, Atypical, etc"
Sense8,"We Mean It This Time, This Is The Final Straw For Netflix

--/r/television, for the 400th time this year"
Sense8,season 3 of I think You Should Leave
Sense8,I like the korean shows.
Sense8,"At one point they had so much content that even when they didn’t have anything new to sell you they had enough old shit it was still being worth subscribed.  They were the one with the deepest library so they’d usually have some show or movie you’d like to watch.  Once that all got split up amongst a dozen services it just became another service you renew whenever it’s got enough new stuff piled up.

I don’t think they’re any worse than any other network though. They cancel shit I love because I love weird shit that not many other people love and so the shit I love is rarely popular enough to be renewed. If I held a grudge against every network that cancelled at least five or six shows I loved I would have no networks to go to.  Do I pray that someone invents a replicator so we live in a post scarcity society and art no longer needs to be profitable?  Hell yeah. Am I going to throw a hissy fit every time I’m reminded that still hasn’t happened?  Nah."
Sense8,"If you are cancelling Netflix because it cancelled some shows you like in favour of others, boy do I hope you’re not thinking the other services are any different...."
Sense8,You and I have similar taste. I could have done with more Sense8 and OA. Season 3 of OA would have been intriguing or gimmicky. Not sure.
Sense8,"1899 feels like it was the last straw for a lot of people.

Walk away, see if you miss it."
Sense8,"Why do people here treat unsubscribing like going through a dramatic break up. wtf is this, r/relationship_advice but for tv? Just drop your sub and come back later if you feel like it."
Sense8,Can the people that post to this sub be any weirder and more dramatic about a show getting cancelled?
Sense8,"Then.... Cancel it? Seriously, is it that difficult? If you find you miss it then resub, none of this is hard.

Is there a way we can ban or megathread these posts about Netflix when the answer is so obvious?"
Sense8,"*An inventory of broken dreams*

This subreddit is so fucking *weird* when it comes to Netflix lmao"
Sense8,"Personally I can always find something to watch, I don’t need to watch high quality Emmy contenders all the time. They have good docs, I like the trashy reality tv, and every now and then they have a decent easy to watch limited series."
Sense8,"Some shows worth watching (for me, at least) with a renewed season (or is complete):

Dragon Prince

The Sandman

Stranger Things

Never Have I Ever

Outlander

Bridgerton

Last Kingdom

Lucifer

Disenchantment

And lots of comedy specials, fun movies and other popular shows.  Of course there is a lot of dreck. But I'm keeping Netflix as my most watched streamer because I don't want the gems to go away."
Sense8,It’s so funny how you constantly see posts like this and then a week later everyone is watching and talking about the latest big Netflix show.
Sense8,Just get another subscription for a different service then switch back when the novelty is back.
Sense8,I'm still salty about Santa Clarita Diet.
Sense8,"Every other day people get together to circle jerk about the inevitable demise of Netflix when it is currently the only streaming service that is making a profit. There are plenty of shows, documentaries, mini-series, on Netflix that are critically acclaimed and well liked. And people who fall in love with a niche show with a TINY audience compared to the massive subscription base population of Netflix keep thinking that their love is enough to justify the continuation o a show that isn’t drawing a large enough audience. HBOMax just went on a cancelation spree. Netflix isn’t unique. In fact, HBO was worst because it has literally stopped shows during production. Disney biggest attention getting shows are mostly one offs that were not intended to be a long series. So they don’t have to worry about renewals. 

There are shows that are insanely popular with new seasons coming. There is diversity in shows these days. You don’t have to like everything. You can sign up and leave any streaming service you want easily. Why even ask this question?"
Sense8,"I find this entire situation hilarious. A thousand Redditors are going bonkers over the fact that Netflix cancelled 1899 and predicting the company is doomed because of it while the rest of the world happily watches Wednesday and Emily in Paris.

Not every piece of content created is catered towards you. Cancel your subscription and go outside."
Sense8,"I'm out. 1899 and Archive 81 were both compelling horror series that were barely advertised, did well anyway, and still got axed. Anything that fails to become a mega-hit like Stranger Things is at risk now."
Sense8,We ditched Netflix and use Hulu and Amazon Prime.
Sense8,"Even if you don't factor in dropped series, all the made for Netflix B movies aren't worth a subscription so I just dropped mine."
Sense8,"Netflix has been the one constant subscription I’ve had since, oh, 2010 or so. It’s also become the most expensive one I have. 

Once *Stranger Things* concludes, I’ll likely bring it out of rotation for a long time.

But with all the HBO Max shenanigans, I might just end up seeking alternative media altogether."
Sense8,"I’m so sick and tired of these posts. If you aren’t getting value, then cancel. Stop whining and looking for validation in your choices. Just choose what you want."
Sense8,you can leave...then go back. you're not married.
Sense8,"I think it's also partially the fault of the shows that are getting too cozy doing a cliffhanger as a means of viewer retention. Don't end your season on a cliffhanger if you haven't secured a next season. It's starting to feel like a really cheap tactic to hype up for a future season, when it's in fact the writers screwing us."
Sense8,"I don't really watch Netflix for their major English language shows. I do watch them when they're well-received which is rarely these days.

I mainly watch Netflix for their foreign language shows. Some of them are such gems, tbh. I don't get these varied selections of foreign language shows from other streaming services.

I still enjoyed US UK shows, but sometimes you need some kind of new flavours, so discovering good foreign language shows can be satisfying. Sometimes they suck, but with those many options, when I found good ones, they're really rewarding."
Sense8,"Maybe it's a ""kids these days"" thing but all this whining about shows being cancelled is so bizarre to me. Where does this attitude even come from? A platform or network that doesn't cancel shows and just lets them have as many seasons as they ""need"" to ""tell a full story"" *has never existed.*"
Sense8,I wish I understood this websites love for 1899. It was painfully slow and boring. Now Santa Clarita diet being cancelled is a fucking tragedy.
Sense8,"I refuse to maintain subscriptions for numerous streaming services. Instead I've taken to keeping a list of things I want to watch and what service they're streaming on. When I get a long enough list for a given streaming service I'll cancel my current service and sign up for the one with my list. When I've watched everything on my list I'll move to the next service.

This approach has some risk that content will expire on the platform before you watch it but it's worth it for me to be able to minimize my entertainment expenses"
Sense8,"There's still good *completed* shows on there, and I feel like people forget that part of the appeal of streaming services is the other, older stuff? Or that you can watch things you've never seen before just to see if you like it?

But yeah at this point I feel like Netflix is only good for November and December (Bake-off and their insane Christmas movies), you can just buy DVDs of most of their originals instead of maintaining a subscription."
Sense8,"> Is it worth maintaining a subscription?

Compared to what? 

Is there another streaming service that you think provides better entertainment for a lower price?

Or are you going to -- shudders -- read a *book!?*

I've got like 6 or 7 streaming services (if you include the ones from Korea and China) and personally I think Netflix provides the most value. For me the hard part is trying to find the stuff I like. Their website sucks balls, so you gotta find good Netflix shows using other websites (throwing darts would be more effective than their site)."
Sense8,"Same. They canceled some of my favorite shows. Punisher and Final Space for example. (and others)

They ruined The Witcher.

And they produced nonsense like Blood Origin and Resident Evil and others instead.

Stranger Things will end after season 5. Umbrella Academy is finished after S4.

There are still some nuggets of gold: Arcane, Sandman, Shadow and Bone.

But it's the first time that I consider unsubscribing."
Sense8,"just buy it month to month. get bored? lose it and ge Disney, or paramount, or discovery or one of the million other channels. 

just come back to it later when you've written a list of programmes to watch!"
Sense8,"I still find a lot of great content.

:shrugs:"
Sense8,"Cancel your subscription you weirdo, the fuck do I care?"
Sense8,"We cancel for about six months and then re-up for a month or two. No reason to pay $20/month for something you don't use/enjoy.  
The only subscription I keep is Hulu, but that's $2/month."
Sense8,"What the fuck happened with the real shows? Marco Polo? Narcos? Mindhunter? Why the real stuff gets the axe and the butchered franchises like the Witcher and death note get the extra effort? I don't really understand the thought process. Short term investments will erode everyone's interests. Netflix was doing classics now is delivering bland and dumb stories. It is time to cancel the subscription? Yes, it is. I don't know why I pay it. Routine I Guess."
Sense8,"I have been done with Netflix for almost 2 years now. I am with you OP. Canceling Sense8 was near the start of the decline, I was quite a fan of the show. Not giving Unbreakable Kimmy Schmitt it’s 5th season pissed me off too. After that it seemed they just cancelled every promising new series they made after a season or 2. I am surprised Stranger Things has lasted this long frankly. I about to start watching OA when I learned that it was being cancelled, didn’t bother even starting it after that. Couple this with the price increases and I was done."
Sense8,There are plenty of good shows on Netflix. You also don't need to be tied down to one subscription forever you can bounce around month to month or as you want to watch something.
Sense8,Seems to me like they’re fishing for another hit and not finding it? I agree that recent series have been underwhelming.
Sense8,Norsemen is hilarious
Sense8,I dont have anything to add other than say that i agree. It’s only needed for 1 month a year. Get rid
Sense8,"Adding my voice to those that disliked the cancelation of Sense8 and Santa Clarita Diet.  Both shows had a lot of life in them.  At least Sense8 had a finish, though it was far too rushed."
Sense8,"I always jump from one service to the next.  After a few months they get new shows or new films, once I'm done watching what I like, I stop paying (I use gift cards) and restart the account of another service who has more interesting choices.  

In the last few months I had Prime, now I'm gonna jump to Disney+.  If they don't want me to go, they need to have better stuff."
Sense8,After stranger things I’m going to bounce. I would have stuck around for Witcher but they are sinking that too. Not sure what else to maintain for.
Sense8,Why do you need us to justify netflix for you? if you dont enjoy it then theres your answer.
Sense8,"They don't seem to have a real plan. If they had been ending the stupid series that they were cancelling, they would have a nice catalogue of mini series that were good for short binging sessions. Now it's just a bunch of incomplete shows."
Sense8,I like the stand up comedy
Sense8,I think netflix seasons need to be 26 episodes long and finish the series by the first season.
Sense8,"Questionable taste in tv shows to begin with but sure, might as well cancel if you don’t find value in it

Not like you can’t sign up again if you want to watch something in the future"
Sense8,Tubi has heaps of cool movies.
Sense8,I'm also salty about The QA
Sense8,"I consistently watch kdramas.  Generally they're written to be wholly wrapped up within one season, and any cliffhangers or teasers for following series are not generally emotionally dissatisfying enough to make me really desperately want answers."
Sense8,"If you have any interest in their original series or films, you could easily binge them in one month. Maybe everyone should just do ""Netflix November""? 🤔"
Sense8,They still have Star Trek in the UK. Once that's gone I'll probably cancel matey.
Sense8,"Nothing wrong to cancel or change to a on demand month per mobth subscription, if you feel like it. Or cancel completly. I bet there is at least another streaming service with nany great shows, you didn't see before. Don't be blindly loyal to any company as costumer."
Sense8,"I'm still sad they cancelled Marco Polo, really liked that show."
Sense8,"I wanted to cancel last year but my kids still watch it so we just downgraded it to the lower tier non-4k plan. Painful thing is I do not think my kids have watched it since, they've pretty much moved 100% to Disney!"
Sense8,How much Netflix are you guys watching? I've never felt even remotely like I was running out of content to watch on there. My list just keeps getting longer and longer. More and more series come out and I dont even have time to catch up on what I was already planning to watch.
Sense8,"I’m close to unsubbing. At the very least, I see no point in just having the sub on a rolling basis.

Fuck Netflix"
Sense8,"I just stopped mine, because they have sreadily crept up a dollar here, dollar there and now it's $15 a month. They're getting too full of thrmselves"
Sense8,Soap2day
Sense8,Just sub once ever 3 to 6 months to catch up
Sense8,"No. Once Better Call Saul ended, my subscribtion ended as well"
Sense8,If you feel like you’re done then you’re done. Cancel. Go on with your life.
Sense8,"I will never forgive Netflix for cancelling Santa Clarita Diet. It had such a great cast and entertaining story, and if I recall correctly, every episode received overwhelmingly positive reviews on IMDB. Then they cancelled it on a cliffhanger."
Sense8,I wanted to watch this on Corn Cob TV but they cancelled it
Sense8,I think what OP is asking is is there anything good on Netflix that y’all are watching that they might miss out on by canceling. I don’t think they’re asking for philosophical help making this big decision.
Sense8,"I’ll be honest my Netflix subscription hinges on a bunch of Korean dramas and occasional new movies.

The reason why I like Asian dramas on Netflix is 
1. They’re usually planned for 1 season. So no abrupt endings or cliffhangers unlike 99% of the English content Netflix licences/produces then ultimately kills.
2. The occasional over-the-top soap opera acting that you just don’t get from Netflix’s English catalog.

Also limited series are a reliable watch. Knowing a story has a start-middle-end is appreciated."
Sense8,Netflix to me still has the most diverse programming.
Sense8,As soon as they stop service sharing between households I’m out.
Sense8,Find a hobby
Sense8,dude Sense8 and The OA were the type of bloat you’re complaining about lol
Sense8,"I'm going to bring the perspective of an old person to this.

I grew up during the golden age of network television.  That meant three networks plus PBS (which wasn't even operational all day long), and a couple of indie UHF stations, as I lived in a fairly major market area.

*Many* series never made it past a single season.  *Everyone's* favorite show would get cancelled eventually.

Eventually, syndication happened, but only shows with enough episodes got picked up, which meant that if something was short-lived, you *never saw it again*.

A season of TV *used* to be 13 weeks, so you had to invest time and effort to watch regularly.  It also meant you were mixing it up, because there were six other days of the week to find something to watch.

Netflix bingeing upended that, where you could now burn through a (shortened) 8-10 episode ""season"" in two or three days.  That meant that content that used to be produced continuously a month or even a week before airing was instead completed as a package.

For the producers of the content, what might have taken a year or more to produce is consumed by the public in a couple of weeks.  Even if the show is well-received and picked up for renewal, for the viewers, there's a huge gap while a *new* season is created.

Netflix and Amazon have both dabbled in stretching out shows in the old way, with a new episode released weekly, but *all those episodes* are already finished.  You can't make a new season in 8 weeks under that model.

Netflix created the circumstances that don't allow a show to build an audience over time; if it's not an immediate hit, it basically disappears into the abyss of suggested content (another problem network TV never had; there was about 24 hours of prime time content each week, not 20,000 titles to dig through).

For the amount of content available (even if a large chunk is unwatchable garbage), Netflix is still a pretty good value, but their preferred model for producing new content vs. the burn rate of watching it isn't sustainable.

Hulu, which tends to hew to the old network episodic model, while still offering a giant archive of 'reruns', tends not to be as spikey in terms of grabbing viewers with the latest hot commodity, but is more consistent with the offerings it does have."
Sense8,I just canceled mine. I join every 18 months for a month to watch breaking bad.
Sense8,I couldn't care less if a show is canceled or not. If that one season was good then you got something out of it. Move on and watch something else...
Sense8,"Netflix fuckin around, they are about to find out. The only reason my subscription has been running for so long is the long trail of password-borrowers that I don't want to look cheap in front of. Now I have an excuse to boot them all, and I'm not dropping to the lower tier, shit is getting turned off. My kids stream Disney 247, I watch YouTube, no one watches Netflix except all the olds..."
Sense8,Just cancel it for a month and see if you miss it. You wont. Streaming services don't have term commitments so it makes sense to cancel it if you see no value in it right now. You can always take it up again later for a month if there is something worthwhile on it again.
Sense8,10 points from saying “I couldn’t care less about” and not “I could care less”. That drives me nuts.
Sense8,"Netflix has limited content I want to watch anymore. I had the service from the days of DVDs but canceled a few years ago. Now I sign up for 6 months every other year and watch what I want, then cancel."
Sense8,"It’s $10 a month.

I tip more when I pick up the tab at breakfast with friends.

Is this really worth a thread?"
Sense8,An inventory of broken dreams? Omg so dramatic lol. Just pause your sub until you want to reactivate
Sense8,"I don’t quite understand these posts. It’s a monthly subscription with no fee to cancel or start again, that even for the lowest paid earner, is no more than 2 hours of work to pay for monthly.  Why the agonizing like you’re selling an old vehicle??"
Sense8,So sad about 1899. It was so intriguing and such a cliffhanger
Sense8,If I didn't have a VPN I would've canceled long ago. Licensed content seems to be good enough to warrant subscription for non-US Netflix users. Bear in mind I don't really bother with Netflix' original content to begin with
Sense8,"You’re not tied into a contract with them, so cancel anytime you want to and re-up later. Cycle through all the services one at a time if you want. Watch Apple TV for a month, then HBO Max, then Disney, then maybe go to Netflix again and binge whatever’s new since the last time you were there. None of these services reward loyalty points or discounts for maintaining an unbroken subscription."
Sense8,"They’re all rushing to be the worst right now it seems. Unless you have money to throw away or you get them for free or a large discount, I believe everyone should only subscribe to a couple streaming sites at at time and then rotate every couple months to a couple different streaming sites. That’s the way to get your money’s worth."
Sense8,"I dip back into Netflix for a month about once every 6 months or so. Takes a couple weeks to work through all the shit I ""missed"" and I find myself bored with it by the time the month's up (and half the shit I would have watched has already been canceled). Content wise, the quality's gone off a cliff over the past couple years, I find it pretty worthless. Apple TV+, Disney+, and Prime have blown past it in terms of quality of original programming."
Sense8,"This post made me very angry, Sense8 was a goddamn masterpiece.

Also yeah I cancelled a few years ago, after the cancelled Sense8, Santa Clarita Diet, Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency and GLOW. I know they're fairly niche things but I adored them.

All I've really missed out on in recent times were Arcane and The Witcher (lol) , so I just used the high seas for that."
Sense8,Cry me a river
Sense8,"Once the password share block comes to my region, I'm out."
Sense8,Paramount+ is a decent alternative.  Great if you are a Trekkie.
Los tiempos de Pablo Escobar,Also a good director. He had the best episodes of season 3 of Narcos: Mexico
Los tiempos de Pablo Escobar,"Well said. I just started watching this and I am blown away by his performance. He is so charismatic, while retaining a principled, believable calmness, even when in the most enraging moments. Best word you used... ""contrived""... it could have so easily gone down that road, but it didn't. I'll watch anything Moura is in. He is brilliant."
Los tiempos de Pablo Escobar,Wagner Moura is incredible.  Been a huge fan ever since the Elite Squad films.
Los tiempos de Pablo Escobar,After spending my whole life listening to British actors pretending to be Russians and Germans and French and every other nationality without bothering to change their accent it cracks me up that people let his accent completely ruin the show for them.  No one calls Sean Connery a hack for playing a Spaniard or a Russian submarine officer or an MI:6 agent with the heaviest Scottish accent known to man.
Los tiempos de Pablo Escobar,"His Colombian accent is also... well, let's say, he made an effort to capture that Medellin cadence and ended up still sounding Brazilian."
Los tiempos de Pablo Escobar,"He's a Brazilian guy playing a Colombian. He's a decent enough actor, but the accent is waaaaay off.

It's like if someone was playing the Queen of England with a Texan accent."
Los tiempos de Pablo Escobar,"He's no Vinny Chase, but he's alright."
Los tiempos de Pablo Escobar,He is a great actor and Narcos is a fantastic show.
Los tiempos de Pablo Escobar,"He was amazing, but his casting was *very* controversial because he's Brazilian and the Colombian's are 2nd to only perhaps the Venezuelans in being protective of their language.

There was an uproar because, ""He sounds like a Brazilian speaking Spanish!""

If you thought he was good in that role, check out the movie [""Elite Squad""](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0861739/) about the Brazilian BOPE. It was the movie that catapulted him into stardom in South America."
Los tiempos de Pablo Escobar,Apparently many Spanish speaking natives can hear his Brazilian accent pretty strongly which takes away from the performance a bit. Definitely a case of “ignorance is bliss” since I don’t speak either language because I thought he was an awesome Pablo
Los tiempos de Pablo Escobar,"Gotta disagree. His accent was terrible, and the cadence at which he spoke was off putting. There had to have been tons of native Spanish speakers, probably some even in Colombia that would have done a better job."
Los tiempos de Pablo Escobar,"He’s great but his Spanish is so god awful, kills it for me."
Los tiempos de Pablo Escobar,"Television performances like these keep getting overlooked by mediocre ones like Jason Sudeikis in ""Ted Lasso""."
Los tiempos de Pablo Escobar,"I found it to be the complete opposite. His performance of Pablo was the worst of any of the actors who portrayed Escobar in the past.

People who say they were impressed with his performance haven't seen any of the other movies that focussed around Escobar.

When you think of Escobar you think of someone who oozes power and fear, someone who when he walks in the room the hairs on the back of your neck stand up. 

This guy had none of that. He looks and acts like someone who is the complete opposite of that. No one fears this guy, he doesn't have that dead look in his eyes.

Secondly, the idiotic thing he has with his pants. The constant pulling up his pants. Go rewatch it again and tally the number of times he pulls up his pants in every single scene. Like he needs to emphasize that he is overweight constantly. Why? It's a non important issue but he is using it to cover up the fact that he isn't scary and intimidating. It's a deflection, a motion of weakness.

Go watch Cliff Curtis in Blow or a Benicio Del Toro in Escobar: Paradise Lost to get a real feel on how Pablo should've been portrayed.

Not this abomination of weakness that Wagner did."
Los tiempos de Pablo Escobar,There is also Patrón del Mar which is a lot more accurate to the real-life person and his family compared to the Netflix show. The Netflix show really tries to reinvent him as a family man when he didn't act like that in real life. It's worth watching if you don't mind that it's written in a long-running soap opera format.
Los tiempos de Pablo Escobar,"yes, and one that tends to go unnoticed. But Moura was just amazing"
Los tiempos de Pablo Escobar,"My wife, a native Spanish speaker, can tell Wagner has different accent compared to the other Spanish speakers."
Los tiempos de Pablo Escobar,Which episode was his?
Los tiempos de Pablo Escobar,Brazilians will always sound Brazilian except me.
Los tiempos de Pablo Escobar,People always made fun of Sean Connery's accent.
Los tiempos de Pablo Escobar,a portugese speaker learning to speak a very specific regional version of spanish would be challenging I imagine
Los tiempos de Pablo Escobar,"To be fair it is like expecting Matt Damon to sound like he's French Canadian, it just was not going by to happen."
Los tiempos de Pablo Escobar,That must really suck for people who understand Spanish. I have to read the subtitles and have absolutely no idea what accent he has or hasn't - so it doesn't throw me off.
Los tiempos de Pablo Escobar,I cant imagine this show is popular in latin america
Los tiempos de Pablo Escobar,Which one you like better ? The original or the Mexico version
Los tiempos de Pablo Escobar,His accent is obvious compared to the other Colombian speakers in the show. I don't think Netflix cared much since this show was marketed more towards North Americans.
Los tiempos de Pablo Escobar,Yea his accent is VERY noticeable. It's pretty bad.
Los tiempos de Pablo Escobar,At least Sudeikis can do a passable Southern accent.
Los tiempos de Pablo Escobar,The examples you mentioned are secondary characters; of course they have to be portrayed in a completely different way.
Los tiempos de Pablo Escobar,Episodes 3 and 4. The episodes with the big shootout scenes in the club and in the airport
Los tiempos de Pablo Escobar,Yeah it's absolutely impossible for me to ignore his accent. Doesn't take away very much from the show. I just pretend it's a weird dialect or some shit.
Los tiempos de Pablo Escobar,Apparently Colombians hate the show
Los tiempos de Pablo Escobar,"I’m Mexican so I speak Spanish. I had no idea what a Colombian accent sounds like his Spanish is fluent I have no issues ever understanding him. Him using a Texan accent when he’s King of England is misleading. It’s more like an a British person pretending to be Australian. Casual viewers probably won’t be able to tell the difference.  Australians would.

That being said Narcos: Mexico the accents are spot on, right down to the slang. I actually got pretty excited hearing it for the first time because how they talk is exactly what I grew up around. I have seen other Spanish TV show but never have I seen it so well before."
Los tiempos de Pablo Escobar,It's offset a bit by the fact that the accents in the show are generally terrible. So Moura doesn't stick out as much.
Los tiempos de Pablo Escobar,"His accent was horrible, just plain God awful. He got the look right, but the sound and most of the mannerisms still screamed Brasilero at 100 Mghz"
Los tiempos de Pablo Escobar,"Yank here 

From the first word he spoke it sounded like he had an accent and wasn’t a natural Spanish speaker. I would have thought English was his first language given the accent.

Despite that, it’s an amazing performance by Wagner."
Los tiempos de Pablo Escobar,Oh hell yeah. Those were definitely top notch
Los tiempos de Pablo Escobar,"It would be shocking if they didn’t. Regardless of any weird accents, the events portrayed don’t exactly show them in a great light."
Los tiempos de Pablo Escobar,"Yeah, the post by u/beardphaze really captures why. Here it is, if you haven't seen it:

https://old.reddit.com/r/television/comments/tpd1g1/wagner_moura_as_pablo_escobar_in_narcos_is_one_of/i2c3v5h/

Stories like this are really common. When I asked a friend if they had seen it, he said no because he can just ask his parents about the real life narcos or turn on the news if he wants to see it in real life. Narcos was written for Netflix's audience in North America. The lack of attention to accents, or hiring Colombian actors is a sticking point, but the show does glorify them in a sense by having him do something evil in one scene and then writing in a scene where he is having a good time with friends in the next. I think Patrón del Mar does it better since it shows how he treated his family when they weren't around."
Los tiempos de Pablo Escobar,"The closest Mexican accent to Colombian accents that I can think of is probably the one from Coahuila, but the slang is different and they're usually much closer to Costa Rican accents. So if you make a mental mix of Coahuila and Tico you'd get somewhere close to a generic Andean area Colombian accent."
Los tiempos de Pablo Escobar,"Yank here 

As a someone with Mexican parents, I loved learning about the different accents different parts had, my favorite being amado’s."
Los tiempos de Pablo Escobar,"Luis Guzmán did not even try to not sound like a Puerto Rican from NYC, he's supposed to be playing Gacha who was originally a pig farmer from the ass end of Cundinamarca before getting into trafficking. In that case the bad accent was actually hilarious, because you got a guy who sounds very obviously like a New Yorker playing the equivalent of someone from the Appalachian mountains of Virginia."
Los tiempos de Pablo Escobar,First time I watched episode 3 I felt so disoriented and anxious because I just did not expect that caliber of scene. And then it was followed by the airport scene next episode? Had to make sure I rewatched em after I had calmed down a bit lol
Los tiempos de Pablo Escobar,"I don't think that's the issue.

Wagner Moura is also very well known for the Elite Squad films, which surely don't portray brazilians or the police forces in brazil in a good light, and yet they are beloved by both.

The issue the colombians have with Narcos isn't that it's offensive to Colombia, it's 

1) The accents 

2) As OP said, it somehow humanizes Escobar. He's sometimes shown in a somewhat empathetic light, his care for his family and how he protected his own... Remember, this is the person who was actually idolized as a saint-like being by many in Colombia, while being essentially a terrorist. The guy set off bombs in airplanes! He is an interesting character, but it's understandable that people who dealt with the shit he pulled aren't keen on the portrayal."
Los tiempos de Pablo Escobar,"> but the show does glorify them in a sense by having him do something evil in one scene and then writing in a scene where he is having a good time with friends in the next

I rather thing that's intentionally to make them seem so callous in their disregard for human life that they could order 15 deaths and then go out for drinks.

I understand why people are bothered by Narcos. But at the same time, I watched that movie very much wishing for Escobar's downfall. There was never a point where he didn't feel like a villain to me."
Los tiempos de Pablo Escobar,I definitely need a rewatch... I binged s03 sooooo fast!!!
Los tiempos de Pablo Escobar,"I definitely didn't feel much sympathy for Escobar watching the show. He's a human being, so presumably he did have some care for his family. But he also had hundreds of people murdered. The airplane bombs definitely should have been in the show though - I don't call them. It makes no sense not to include the worst things he's had done - even beyond the need to show his evil it also makes for better television anyway.

But either way, it's hard not to come away from the show feeling like Escobar is a murderous piece of shit along with the other cartels. Really the only primary characters I felt much sympathy for that weren't murdered by the cartels were the guy that turns informant in season 2 and Pedro Pascal's Agent Peña (who is much less of a psychopath than Steve)."
Los tiempos de Pablo Escobar,"He blew up a plane that my uncle was supposed to be in, my uncle missed the flight because the taxi he was in got in a fender bender. Now my uncle was not the target, he was just an engineer that was supposed to fly to Cali. Escobar had the supreme court set on fire and blew up the DAS ( local FBI/ATF/CIA/NSA combo agency) building. I had relatives within a mile of both places when it happened, Narcos minimizes the suffering and glorifies these asshats."
Los tiempos de Pablo Escobar,"In regards to #2 that's just being lazy.  Osama Bin Laden had children, Hitler had a dog, and the vast majority of drug kingpins and terrorists have *someone* or *something* in their lives they care about.  Very few people are pure evil to the core and portraying a real person as a moustache twirling soulless monster with pits of fire for eyes and a snake tongue is some 50s white/black hat shit the entertainment and art worlds moved past more than half a century ago when they realized audiences generally aren't complete morons who can't understand the concept of morally gray areas.

They show the horrors he committed, it's not like acknowledging the existence of his family makes him look better.  He ruined the lives of his kids and wife (who also had responsibility for enabling such a piece of shit) because he was a greedy pig, it's not like any of them have a happy ending.  But oh no, they show a brief scene where he dances with his wife to distract her from the affair she knows he's having so we have to maybe acknowledge his humanity for a few seconds before going back to him ordering the deaths of men, women and children!"
Los tiempos de Pablo Escobar,"Being lazy?

Yes, Bin Laden had children and Hitler had a dog.

How many times have you seem Hitler portrayed in hollywood as a vegan animal lover? Most importantly, how do you think the jewish community would feel?

It's not about denying their humanity or pretending they were moustache twirling villains. But, take something like Breaking Bad or The Sopranos. Media has the power to make people empathize and side with terrible people. That's very interesting when it's a fictional character or someone far removed from your reality...

But you gotta remember we're not talking a fictional character and neither are we talking about someone unheard of - at least not to the colombians. We're talking about the drug overlord who is still VERY present in people's minds, who is still regarded by many as a defender of the poor, whose presence is still very much felt in colombian politics.

Imagine it's not Escobar, but some influential KKK Grand Wizard being portrayed. Can you see how some people might think it's problematic, even if humanizing them is possibly realistic and they are not really a bond villain?"
Los tiempos de Pablo Escobar,">Can you see how some people might think it's problematic, even if humanizing them is possibly realistic and they are not really a bond villain

If it's realistic then no it's not ""problematic"", it's the uncomfortable reality"
Los tiempos de Pablo Escobar,Weekend at Pablo's?
Los tiempos de Pablo Escobar,El chapo. I want to see those prison escapes on netflix
Los tiempos de Pablo Escobar,"The name of the show is ""Narcos"" they could continue on the story progression to how Mexico took over and God knows the Mexico Cartel is a treasure trove of story potential."
Los tiempos de Pablo Escobar,uh!? pablo dies!? thanks for the spoilers jeeeez 2nd season aint even out yet! gosh!!
Los tiempos de Pablo Escobar,i like money too
Los tiempos de Pablo Escobar,"so, it will be a anthology series like Fargo and True Detective.

Fine with me."
Los tiempos de Pablo Escobar,I would love to see an American horror story type format where they cover the rise and fall of several cartels in Colombia and later Mexico throughout several seasons 
Los tiempos de Pablo Escobar,"Move on to the mexican cartels... so many stories, so many characters."
Los tiempos de Pablo Escobar,"They should make a couple of seasons about Griselda Blanco ""The Godmother"".  Her story from start to finish would make great TV.  "
Los tiempos de Pablo Escobar,"Let's see Griselda Blanco's story. She's one bad cookie
"
Los tiempos de Pablo Escobar,If they didn't empty their clip in that first season maybe this series could've continued Pablo's story for 3-4 seasons. 
Los tiempos de Pablo Escobar,Narcos should be a show about narcos . After pablos Death they should move on to another narcos and so on.  That would pretty cool to see
Los tiempos de Pablo Escobar,Personally I'm more interested in how they portray the death of Pablo Escobar in Narcos. There are conflicting stories in real life regarding who shot and killed Pablo. I think that Pablo killed himself as he was trapped. But again many conflicting stories on who got the killshot. I think Pablo. Then there's all the groups after him. I can't wait.
Los tiempos de Pablo Escobar,"I know everyone is saying Mexico, but I'd love if they also went into Afghanistan's drug exporters at some point."
Los tiempos de Pablo Escobar,This is the first show where my mom got hooked.  She barely speaks any English and couldn't stop watching because she remembered so much of it.  Drug lord stories like this are amazing.
Los tiempos de Pablo Escobar,"I always thought this would an anthology series, with each season (or two) dedicated to different drug lords. It seems this is the route they're taking."
Los tiempos de Pablo Escobar,"They should do one about, Amado Carrillo Fuentes,"
Los tiempos de Pablo Escobar,"There is so much they could do. The war on drugs in Colombia is still happening even now, definitely could go into the paramilitary, farc etc. taking over the drug trade from the cartels"
Los tiempos de Pablo Escobar,"They all got captured or killed, while other cartels and groups took over their business.  There, saved people a lot of time."
Los tiempos de Pablo Escobar,"I'm reading ""Power of the Dog"" right now, and man, it would be really fascinating to see a season about Miguel Felix Gallardo and the Arellano Felix brothers.  So many good/harrowing stories related to their cartels."
Los tiempos de Pablo Escobar,ITT: People who think Pablo's death needs a spoiler alert. 
Los tiempos de Pablo Escobar,Should we tell them?
Los tiempos de Pablo Escobar,"I am so pumped for this & I hope they do keep it going. Not sure how that would look, but I'd be interested in watching it. "
Los tiempos de Pablo Escobar,"Meh, I actually thought that season 1 could've had like 4 episodes more or so and just finish of the series."
Los tiempos de Pablo Escobar,Here I am hoping they can find a way to cut the amount of narration down to less then two minutes and episode. 
Los tiempos de Pablo Escobar,They should.  It's a good show. 
Los tiempos de Pablo Escobar,Guy wants to keep his job. News at 11
Los tiempos de Pablo Escobar,I bet he doe$
Los tiempos de Pablo Escobar,No they stopped growing coca and making yayo once Pablo died everyone knows there is no drama in colombia since his death.
Los tiempos de Pablo Escobar,Maybe they could concentrate on the Columbians who put their asses on the line without the backing of the US government. 
Los tiempos de Pablo Escobar,"I take it this show is alright, then? I've seen it listed on Netflix but never bothered to watch it. "
Los tiempos de Pablo Escobar,I know it isn't a spoiler because he is a real person and does really die but it ruins the suspense of the show for me.  I was hoping that he was going to make it a little over half of the season just for the shocker and then set up the next season in the following episodes
Los tiempos de Pablo Escobar,Oh god I misread that and thought Pedro pascal died. I'm not ready for that
Los tiempos de Pablo Escobar,"I thought he would die sometime during the season and would pick up with another narco family. Hopefully this season isn't drawn out nonsense because at the point where season 1 ended, there wasn't that much time until Pablo was killed"
Los tiempos de Pablo Escobar,"Considering how fast Season 1 went through his life, I was expecting him to die in like episode 2 or something of this season, anyway..."
Los tiempos de Pablo Escobar,"No no no!!! Get away from this idea that seeing through and completing and ending your story you intended to tell is somehow wrong. You wanted to tell the story of Pablo and you have done very well so far. At the end: stop! Your just going to drag the name down! Don't be ""The Simpsons"", be ""Seinfeld"". End on a good note guys. Please?"
Los tiempos de Pablo Escobar,"What's the point? Drug cartels basically ended when he died. Probably no good material left to tap. As long as you forget the history of the war on drugs.


"
Los tiempos de Pablo Escobar,"Is this show worth it? I watched the first episode and couldn't get into it--does it get more interesting after the pilot, or would you say the pilot is a good representation of the show?"
Los tiempos de Pablo Escobar,"Article explains very little, unfortunately. I wouldn't mind this if there's still a good story to tell. Mexican cartels?"
Los tiempos de Pablo Escobar,"Goddammit! couldn't be bothered to put [Spoiler!] in the title?

Outside forces tug on their morality at different points, given they're in a corrupt police department in a corrupt city, but it seems like those two were always able to hold each other up to a higher standard. 

Cameron and Donna from Halt and Catch Fire. Two seemingly polar opposites at first (one being the punk, rebel young programming phenom and one being a prissy veteran of the industry who kind of lost her spark and is living a cozy life). Constantly starting brilliant projects together, losing they way due to their egos and splitting up, fucking each other over, finding each other again. They kind of echo Cameron and Joe--which was a romantic relationship--in that they always find their way back to each other, yet it seems inevitable that it won't last, but while they're together it's beautiful."

To see it start with her bringing him to the football club only because she intended to destroy the club and hurt her ex-husband, and then to now where they are besties.

Young and Hungry,Have any freeform/ABC family shows gotten past a 5th season?
Young and Hungry,Wow it took 5 years. I liked this show it was a good time pass but it was doomed to be cancelled. 5 years is impressive especially under ABC who have the worst rate at cancelling shows. 
Young and Hungry,For some reason I thought this happened like three years ago. 
Young and Hungry,No! This show was such a guilty pleasure for me. 
Young and Hungry,Freeform airs the Fosters which is a pretty good show. Not everything is crap on that network.
Young and Hungry,"I remember the very first episode. They walked up to the counter as if getting ready to eat, the intro plays... and they're standing in the EXACT SAME FUCKING SPOT, only dinner is ""done.""

Laziest shit ever."
Young and Hungry,"I just checked and only two that I can see... Pretty Little Liars had 7 seasons, and Baby Daddy had 6... nothing else has gotten past 5 seasons."
Young and Hungry,"Which is also ending after 5 seasons the same as Switched At Birth did .

The Fosters is supposed to be getting a spinoff with Callie and Mariana living in LA after college "
Young and Hungry,I love The Fosters... one of my favorite shows.  Really sad to hear it's ending.
Young and Hungry,It’s gotten a bit weird lately. I feel like they’re focusing more on current politics than they are the family. The only kid we see regularly is Callie. 
Young and Hungry,It’s weird that there are so many people who actually found this show funny … idiots actually gave this lame garbage better ratings than actual funny sitcoms like Everybody Loves Raymond .
Young and Hungry,"did they cancel baby daddy too?
"
Young and Hungry,"I'm still enjoying Young and Hungry. I think it's hilarious. I see how people are getting tired of some of the plot lines, like the will they/ won't they relationship, but it's not bothering me as much as other shows with this problem. "
Young and Hungry,I'm a grown black man but this show is my guilty pleasure
Young and Hungry,"I liked the show.  It was dumb,  cheap fun.  Not that thats a bad thing.  Just saying its not very deep or anything.  Sometimes you just wanna watch something you don't have to think about that makes you laugh.  I like the side characters of Yolanda and elliot and sofia more than the main cast tbh.

I was sad to hear season 5 was the last.  Apparent a tv movie was in the works to end the series properly but who knows if itll happen."
Young and Hungry,It’s a show you watch to kill time that’s about it .
Young and Hungry,I think the movie is still happening. 
Young and Hungry,I hope it does.  Just saying the show was never super super popular like game of thrones or breaking bad popular or something.  Movies being made to finish off series are kinda rare.  Like I said I really hope it does happen though.  The series really didnt get a proper ending.(although itll probably follow the trope of gabi and josh getting married in the end. lol) 
Young and Hungry,I just hate that it’s getting a movie to end it when we couldn’t get the same for Stitchers when it ended on a huge cliffhanger. 
Young and Hungry,"I felt the same way about the witches of east end.  The show was doing pretty good in the ratings for a Lifetime show.  It was the end of season 2.  Everyone was like almost sure it was gonna get renewed so they left the show on a HUGE cliffhanger.  Basically its Charmed 2.0 only in this version instead of three sisters you have a mom and 2 daugters.  The ""sisters"" find out their grandfather is like pretty much satan or some big ass powerful demon from the underworld.  Their mom has two sisters, one who can turn herself into a cat and another who is basically the keeper of souls/Hel from the underworld(they based alot of their stuff off greek myth I think)  It even had James Marsters who played Spike on Angel.  Julia Ormond as the mother and Jenna Dewan Tatum(Channing Tatum's wife as one of the sisters.)  The big cliffhanger at the end of season 2 was that most of the main cast members died.  They were going to have to go to the underworld and fight the mother's sister to get them back. "
Young and Hungry,"I'm kinda tempted to start it, even if I'm not interested, because I want it to do well so that Netflix may consider adapting other stuffs from Jonathan Stroud (yes, this is about Bartimaeus. I want it as a TV show)."
Young and Hungry, I love Joe Cornish so I’ll jump in with no second season renewal parachute
Young and Hungry,"Another fantasy YA!

Netflix is literally a mash up of The CW, Hallmark and Lifetime"
Young and Hungry,STEPHEN!
Young and Hungry,"All the reviews I've seen so far are pretty positive. 

https://www.radiotimes.com/tv/fantasy/lockwood-co-netflix-review/

https://www.telegraph.co.uk/tv/0/lockwood-co-netflix-review-ghostly-adventure-bags-ramshackle/


As a fan of the series and of the movie work Joe Cornish has done (as well as all the Adam and Joe stuff), I am really looking forward to this."
Young and Hungry,And will get cancelled and left on a cliffhanger after season 2.
Young and Hungry,"I am a fan of Joe Cornish's previous films, Attack the Block and The Kid Who Would Be King, so I'll take a chance and check this out even though Netflix has burned me so, so many times before."
Young and Hungry,"Honestly the trailer doesn't convince me, it seems to have the usual Netflix's decent cgi and teen leads acting cool. But I'll be watching since it's Joe Cornish."
Young and Hungry,I love the books so I hope this series turns out to be a good adaptation
Young and Hungry,"Feb 8th 2023: Lockwood & Co. has less viewers than Stranger Things, canceled."
Young and Hungry,Can’t wait for this to be cancelled! It’ll be right after I start watching it too.
Young and Hungry,"Ah the girl from As Dusk Falls,

Sounds cool too, I hope it's enjoyable and can last on its own term"
Young and Hungry,"Really excited for this. It looks like the makers have tried to keep it real close to the source material too. Also, if this is a hit, we can expect some Bartimaeus stuff soon!"
Young and Hungry,I ll wait2 or 3 seasons before starting it
Young and Hungry,STEVEN?
Young and Hungry,"Didn't know Joe Cornish was involved with this, will have to give it a watch."
Young and Hungry,"You this show is great and has good ratings  

Netflix: Awesome, cancel it."
Young and Hungry,"Positive critic reviews, people seem to enjoy it, annnnnnnd it's canceled by Netflix (soon, probably)."
Young and Hungry,"Unless they are absolute must watch, hear about them everywhere shows, I refuse to invest anymore into Netflix"
Young and Hungry,The next news of it will be cancelled after one season.
Young and Hungry,"Netflix cancels most shows before the end of a third season in order to avoid having to negotiate new contracts with all creatives and talent involved. Most upfront deals are for three seasons, with pre-negotiated pay scaling. So small “hits” that in prestreaming times might have lasted four or more seasons get canned, since Netflix will have to pay a LOT more to keep EVERYONE. Only truly massive breakout shows are worth them backing up the truck and dumping money. 

Also there’s a presumed Netflix tax, similar to the Disney or Star Wars tax, where everyone assumes they have infinite money so everyone demands more money to work for them. Which forces budgets up for things. Which means they have less money to extend middling or struggling shows.

Also? They just don’t have enough execs to cover their shows. So quality is wobbly as fuck except for their big big spend shows. Which means, shows don’t have someone helping with quality control AND don’t have advocates INSIDE Netflix who can love that wobbly show enough to fight for it to stay around."
Young and Hungry,Has it been cancelled though?
Young and Hungry,"What *IS* it about UK casting that is so good? When I watch UK TV, the characters seem like real people. When you watch US produced shows, the characters seems incredibly surreal a lot of the time."
Young and Hungry,Odds on it getting cancelled after 1 season?
Young and Hungry,"i just keep giving up on these Netflix YA shows like Locke and Key, First Kill, The Order (latter two were cancelled afterwards)"
Young and Hungry,"Have seen 0 advertisements, or marketing, it’s got a young cast and its Sci-fi YA. Do I even watch if it’s just going to get cancelled?"
Young and Hungry,I’m thinking wait until five seasons as I’m concerned they will just cancel it just as I get into it
Young and Hungry,Ah another good show? Sounds like it will get canceled by Netflix here soon.
Young and Hungry,Waiting to hear about it getting cancelled.
Young and Hungry,"First I’ve heard of it, so I assume it has already been cancelled?"
Young and Hungry,I would watch this but I'm afraid it will be canceled without a conclusion like everything else on Netflix.  Feels like they are in a bit of a death spiral that they caused.
Young and Hungry,Netflix sucks
Young and Hungry,No more
Young and Hungry,"Non ya person here but what’s with the swords? Seems kinda hokey, like swashbuckling Ghostbusters."
Young and Hungry,What does YA mean here?
Young and Hungry,Why can’t we just get an adaptation of the Pepperwood Chronicles
Young and Hungry,important is to know does this season have a cliffhanger yes or no? i read it covers 2 books. but never read the books. so is it a complete story. or will it be very open ended?
Young and Hungry,"Here's a lesson in Economics 101: If there's enough demand for something, smart business minds will find a way to make money off of it. That simple. But the execs at Netflix are just too stupid and unimaginative so they cancel everything."
Young and Hungry,Netflix's YA adaptation will not get enough season and end with one or two seasons.
Young and Hungry,"Bartimaeus is my favorite book series ever. Could translate well to TV, would need a good budget for sure though."
Young and Hungry,"Netflix bases cancellations in large part on what percentage of people finish a show that they started.  If you're starting it for this sake, finish it."
Young and Hungry,I love the Bartimeaus trilogy so bad but I don’t want them to butcher it as a tv series
Young and Hungry,"> yes, this is about Bartimaeus

Holy shit you got me excited for a second there thinking this series was somehow related to the Bartimaeus books. I loved those when I was younger. The Bartimaeus series along with Garth Nix Old Kingdom are my dream series to get adapted well."
Young and Hungry,"There’s no point in starting it, Netflix will just cancel it. They have this self-perpetuating cancelation loop going and it’s super frustrating. They cancel great shows and then no one wants to watch their shows because they know they’ll just get canceled, leading to low watch numbers and canceled shows. I’m still salty about Midnight Club."
Young and Hungry,"I would really recommend watching it, it was an amazing show! I didn't even read the books but I loved it."
Young and Hungry,"I wish Joe Cornish had more stuff out since Attack the Block, one of my all time favorites. I need more movies like that from him."
Young and Hungry,"I understand why people say this, but if you don’t watch it then they *definitely* won’t renew it"
Young and Hungry,"Man, there was like a brief eighteen month period a few years back where Netflix was aiming to be high brow."
Young and Hungry,Just coming!
Young and Hungry,Good ol Cornballs!
Young and Hungry,"I prefer books as a medium but I usually don't read ones aimed at a younger audience, so if you don't mind, could I get a little rundown on why you like it?"
Young and Hungry,"Based on the trailer, it looks to follow the first two books. While there is an arc that goes over all 5 books, these first two books in particular have self-contained stories."
Young and Hungry,Bold of you to assume there will be a season 2 👀
Young and Hungry,Which is why we are probably canceling Netflix this month. Nothing worth watching since it all gets canceled.
Young and Hungry,The Netflix way
Young and Hungry,Very optimistic. I will probably be canceled while I type this.
Young and Hungry,That long?
Young and Hungry,THAT'S where she's from! I liked that game.
Young and Hungry,....Just coming!
Young and Hungry,"> Netflix cancels most shows before the end of a third season in order to avoid having to negotiate new contracts with all creatives and talent involved. Most upfront deals are for three seasons, with pre-negotiated pay scaling.

How many of their new shows have 3-season deals up front?"
Young and Hungry,"I would say with this, it looks like they are straight up adapting the books, there is maybe 3 seasons worth of content. There are five books (and one novella). Season 1 looks to cover books 1 and 2. The later books are slightly longer, but not massively. 

Say season 2 covered books 3 and 4 and then maybe a shorter final season for book 5."
Young and Hungry,That’s not true. Netflix pays higher rates in lieu of residuals.
Young and Hungry,We will know when the opening week viewership ratings come in a week from today.
Young and Hungry,I would say that this one was much better than the ones you mentioned
Young and Hungry,"There are only 5 novels in the series and the first season of the show uses 2 of those so unless Stroud or the writers are extending the stories further, we'll probably only need 3 seasons to finish the story from the books."
Young and Hungry,"So.... everyone will go to a Marvel movie opening weekend to see how bad it is.

But the same everyone will wait to see if a show they're actually interested in gets canceled before they'll watch it.

You do realize, going to the movie you don't like tells networks, make more of this. And not watching the show you might like tells them; don't make this.  

If you watch it, it is less likely to get canceled."
Young and Hungry,"It's based on a series of books. Season 1 looks to cover books 1 and 2. While there is an ongoing arc, these two books are pretty light on that (at least in the books) and each book is a self-contained plot."
Young and Hungry,"In the universe where the stories are set silver and iron help dispel and weaken the ghosts so the ghost hunters use rapiers made from these metals as their main form of offence & defence against ghosts. I'm a fan of the novels and really looking forward to this series, hoping Joe Cornish has done it justice, I'm sure he will have!"
Young and Hungry,"It's based on real-world lore, according to which ghosts and other supernatural entities can be harmed by certain materials - iron, silver, salt, etc. So the weapons used by ghost hunters include rapiers and salt bombs and steel chains and silver lined glass jars for containment."
Young and Hungry,Young Adult. It's one of the age classifications for books. Around age 12 and up.
Young and Hungry,"The season ends on a minor cliffhanger, but it’s not related to any major plot points (and you can Google the answer to the question if you’re interested and get the answer from the books). But overall, the season covers the first two books which are self contained stories. There are some threads that link to later plot points but you mostly won’t notice them unless you’ve read the books."
Young and Hungry,"The first two books are rather self contained but hint at an overarching plot that really gets going from the third book on. Going of the books, there could be a bit of a cliffhanger, but that won’t necessarily lead to the story of the season feeling unresolved. And honestly, even if the series gets hit by the Netflix cancellation bus, the books are right there, and they are definitely worth a read."
Young and Hungry,"Well, the snarky footnotes are one of my favorite ongoing joke mechanisms, but I’m not sure how they could capture the creative side-note nature of it

Like a voiceover can do it, but it may overlap with the ongoing action or dialogue. And there was always the extra fun of finishing a paragraph and finding what Bartimaeus really thought or a funny tidbit of magician history, which I’m not sure how they could capture the Easter egg nature of it.

I’m all for it but adapting it would take a good creative hand"
Young and Hungry,The Bartimaeus Trilogy wa great. I really liked the magic system in that series.
Young and Hungry,"If they have to butcher I don't want it either ofc. I'm just hoping that they could do it right, it's a pretty straightforward story too. I can totally see it becoming a hit, but it would need a competent screenwriter."
Young and Hungry,[deleted]
Young and Hungry,"> They cancel great shows

Such as?"
Young and Hungry,"Cornish has been unlucky. Cornish Snow Crash adaption fell through and he missed out on a few studio directing gigs.

Cornish is working on the Attack The Block sequel"
Young and Hungry,"Have you tried The Kid who would be King? 

It's not as good as Attack the Block and I was a little disappointed first time around, but I gave it a re-watch when it came to D+ and I enjoyed it. Maybe a tiny bit too long and definitely aimed at a younger audience, but still entertaining."
Young and Hungry,They are appealing to their majority audience now - young teens and middle aged housewives
When Calls the Heart,"Is this a sequel to *The Heart, She Holler*"
When Calls the Heart,when calls the heart just tell her home I am not
When Calls the Heart,"I wonder if our hero, Whenerly, will finally be able to reach an area with enough cell reception to reconnect with her boyfriend, Hartford ""The Heart"" Romance"
When Calls the Heart,what is that title? is it a question?
When Calls the Heart,"This show will never end.

The first season was actually pretty good.  Then the entire town started buying coats at Ross and stopped being a poor frontier town."
When Calls the Heart,The worst name for a tv show ever. It doesn't even make sense.
When Calls the Heart,"Oh, goody.  More *Beach Curls History*."
When Calls the Heart,"i wish it were, you have no idea"
When Calls the Heart,It's actually Whenifred. Clearly not a real fan...
When Calls the Heart,"Unfortunately, Whenerly has AT&T..."
When Calls the Heart,It’s like “Who’s on First?” It’s about a guy named When. He frequently calls the heart. Great show.
When Calls the Heart,The show is called *When Calls the Heart*.
When Calls the Heart,"From what I’ve read, it’s just a more poetic way of saying “when the heart calls.”"
When Calls the Heart,what does it mean?!
When Calls the Heart,Lol. A fancy way of saying “when the heart calls”.
When Calls the Heart,"I sure hope Whenerly, the lead of the series, successfully manages to call The Heart, her old high school boyfriend, this season. The lines can only be busy for so long!"
When Calls the Heart,">The ninth season of hit drama When Calls the Heart’s ratings culminated with a season high, with the final episode ranking as the most watched of the season in homes (2.6 million), and among women 18+ (2.3 million) and total viewers (3.1 million) on a Live+3 basis. The program also ranked as this year’s most-watched original scripted series on ad-supported cable in homes (2.4 million), and among women 18+ (2.2 million) and total viewers (2.9 million).

I've literally never heard of this show. The divide between streaming viewers and old-fashioned cable TV viewers is sharp."
When Calls the Heart,I am stoked.  I am deeply concerned about the possibility of reopening the mine.
When Calls the Heart,Is Jack still dead?
When Calls the Heart,Very excited! This is such a nice feel good show.
When Calls the Heart,Hopefully they can meet under a gazebo to finally kiss
When Calls the Heart,"We in Canada get it on CBC (non-cable, over the air) regularly."
When Calls the Heart,"I only first heard of the show because Lori Loughlin was in it and when that scandal hit, Hallmark dumped her from it and this mystery movie series she was a part of."
When Calls the Heart,I only heard of it because of the Lauri Loghlin scandal and I had completely forgotten about it until now.
When Calls the Heart,apparently that same mine was on riverdale
When Calls the Heart,He is.  But there is always another RCMP sniffing around.
When Calls the Heart,super channel gets it first and its supposed to be a co production between them and hallmark
When Calls the Heart,Well that makes me feel mixed feelings.  But just like the people of hope valley I will hide my anger and think only good thoughts.
When Calls the Heart,"I'm pretty annoyed she didn't get the book thrown at her. She and Felicity Huffman both suck in this situation, but at least Huffman wasn't trying to kid anyone and owned to it. Loughlin dragged her feet the entire time until 50 years in prison hit the table and she cowtowed and STILL got leniency, She should still be in prison frankly."
When Calls the Heart,[deleted]
When Calls the Heart,"No mention of Jocelyn Hudon for season #2 of *When Hope Calls* – me no like-y.

P.S. For anyone that is wondering ""GAC Family"" is the new name of ""Great American Country"" channel."
When Calls the Heart,Aunt Becky is a criminal
When Calls the Heart,I don't see her staring in ANYTHING I ever want to see again.  I guess GAC viewers don't care that she's a piece of shit.
When Calls the Heart,I knew this would eventually happen
When Calls the Heart,Sweet chocolate Jesus I was hoping her first returning role was going to be some *hot mama's rioting in prison* grindhouse film. Aunt Becky in a torn and sweaty orange jumpsuit. Ummmmm...
When Calls the Heart,Fuck off
When Calls the Heart,"This is disgusting; she should have been blacklisted. I'm sure she could get a job somewhere as a receptionist, as long as she isn't required to handle money."
When Calls the Heart,"How, in any universe, is prison time even on the table for what these people did?  Like, seriously, *50 years?* For what, really?

Prison is for people we are afraid of, not people we are mad at."
When Calls the Heart,"I forget. Is Huffman still serving time or is she out too? If anything, Huffman should be the one be given a second chance but only marginally."
When Calls the Heart,And I’ll even do the fuckin
When Calls the Heart,So can Hallmark
When Calls the Heart,"Shit ton of bribery and fraud, it adds up. I doubt she would’ve actually got 50 years but she was asserting she wasn’t guilty until they added in additional charges that prompted the potential 50 years. That’s when her tune changed."
When Calls the Heart,"She may not be a threat to you personally, but she's a threat to the integrity of the college system. Buying your kid a place in college fucks it up for other, more worthy, students. It creates incompetent graduates, and that's a disaster."
When Calls the Heart,She's out. Got a bit too short of a sentence but like I said she wasn't trying to bullshit when the bubble finally burst.
When Calls the Heart,"Huffman owned up to what she did, which does make a difference."
When Calls the Heart,"Look at this man, taking one for the team. A hero you are, sir."
When Calls the Heart,[deleted]
When Calls the Heart,She’s not gonna do it again. Relax.
When Calls the Heart,I believe Hallmark actually cut her from their shows and stopped airing the reins of films with her in them
When Calls the Heart,TIL it’s unreasonable to wish someone who did something wrong and kept denying it was held a bit more accountable than they were.
When Calls the Heart,"That's awful. Poor kid. The only thing I really know him as is young Barry from Flash, which [Grant posted about on Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/p/B-iCMd4FebA/?igshid=1fmmb7r9qpsyb). Feel bad for his family."
When Calls the Heart,"Jeez, 16 is way too young, and the cause of death I'm guessing is something really tragic.

RIP, kid."
When Calls the Heart,"inb4 rude comments: The article doesn't disclose cause of death, just that it was ""sudden"". It doesn't suggest drugs or covid were responsible, doesn't mention he had previous conditions. The article is mostly about how much it sucks that the family can't comfort each other in person because of social distancing."
When Calls the Heart,This is sad. Also heartbreaking because the family can't physically be together during this hard and unexpected loss.
When Calls the Heart,"I don't recognise him because I haven't gotten to watch those shows, but God fucking damn, 16 is just unspeakably unfair."
When Calls the Heart,"Awful news,so sad. RIP."
When Calls the Heart,"so young, unspeakably awful"
When Calls the Heart,Oh he is the actor who played the young version of grant gustin.
When Calls the Heart,My condolences to his family. It is very tragic that he died at such a young age..
When Calls the Heart,poor kid and poor family. Life can end in a flash.
When Calls the Heart,[removed]
When Calls the Heart,The main suspect? Eobard Thawne.
When Calls the Heart,[removed]
When Calls the Heart,"I've been around long enough to know when the cause of death isn't mentioned, it's almost always a suicide case.

Just being real, people."
When Calls the Heart,"I mean, any cause of death is tragic"
When Calls the Heart,They are keeping it a big secret therefore it must be something like suicide or overdose
When Calls the Heart,[deleted]
When Calls the Heart,"The father of someone I went to elementary school with died unexpectedly of a heart attack this week. Even though his death had nothing to do with the virus, they can’t have a proper funeral or memorial because of social distancing.

When Calls the Heart,not to be fucked up but also for drugs/OD unintentional or not
When Calls the Heart,Or maybe his mother wanted privacy. Not everyone announces every fart on social media like the Kardashians
When Calls the Heart,"I mean, he's also a minor, so there's that."
When Calls the Heart,"Don’t speculate shit like this. If you’re tight, that’s private and doesn’t need discussed. If you’re wrong, you guys are never around to admit it or correct the fact that you’re wrong. You’ll keep making these kind of statements, free of evidence.

Don’t speculate about cause of death. It’s problematic, and ghoulish."
When Calls the Heart,He died from covid19.
When Calls the Heart,"My mind went straight to Covid, but this is possible too"
When Calls the Heart,"But from an underage kid, **and** all so suddenly, that's what makes it so sad."
When Calls the Heart,"It doesn't have to be. I had a friend in middle school, who in high school just dropped dead during gym. Turned out, she had an undiagnosed heart condition. Could be pending an autopsy."
When Calls the Heart,But because he’s a minor would they just not disclose the reason to protect his privacy?
When Calls the Heart,"I like how you satirize people using that as reasoning for him dying, but nobody was talking about it, so you're the only one coming off as an asshole."
When Calls the Heart,"Bro, come on..."

When Calls the Heart,"All the comments are removed, what the fuck were they on about?"

When Calls the Heart,[removed]
When Calls the Heart,Ironic to say of a mother who put her kid in show business. I get your ultimate point. Just thought the way you've made it was funny.
When Calls the Heart,It's public news. We can and will speculate all we want.
When Calls the Heart,"It doesn't have to be, but it's usually phrased like that, when the cause of death is problematic. If it was a simple health issue, they would likely mention it to kill off any nasty rumors."
When Calls the Heart,Thats HOCM. Some people who have it die at a young age if they are into sports or any activity requiring immense physical work.
When Calls the Heart,"This. I assumed that minors get privacy that adults normally wouldn't. Sad situation, idk why people are obsessed/interested in how he passed."
When Calls the Heart,[removed]
When Calls the Heart,Just saying that dude Grant Gustin was secretly gay for some reason.
When Calls the Heart,Why do you choose to be the person who you are? You can and should be better.
When Calls the Heart,"I know his family. He’s straight. Sorry, friend."
When Calls the Heart,Why are you saying that though?
Schitts Creek,"I just watched Schitt’s Creek for the first time and really enjoyed it. I could see them doing maybe like an episode special or something like that. One thing I was hoping to see was an episode of them all settled into their lives a few months or years down the line. 

Also just saying, but Ted’s job offer was for 3 years and Schitt’s Creek is coming up on 3 years since it ended."
Schitts Creek,"Don't.

It's a show that ended at exactly the right time on exactly the right note just on the precipice of overstaying its welcome. It was a tiny little miracle of a sitcom that beautifully transcended being Canadian Arrested Development (which is really all it was in Season 1) and stopped in the most rewarding, best possible place.

Leave it there."
Schitts Creek,"Levy:

>”It (Schitt’s Creek) seems to be what most people talk about when they see me on the street or in different counties. Then after that, it's kind of neck and neck with American Pie, which is still up there.""


>“I miss the cast. Fortunately, I see my kids, that's good,"" he says, referring to Dan Levy, who plays David Rose, and his daughter Sarah Levy, who plays ditzy waitress Twyla Sands.


>""It was a great production, mostly everybody was on the show for all six years. It was really just such a delightful show to do. The fact that I'm working with my son and daughter, it was kind of a gift to fatherhood I guess. I thought it was hitting on all cylinders pretty much from the first season right through to our last.""

>”There's nothing in the works right now to be honest, but you know, we've never stopped thinking about what might happen down the line. We're certainly open to anything, I think when the idea that is the right idea presents itself we'll probably act on, I guess."""
Schitts Creek,I was meaning to rewatch until I realized it got pulled from Netflix. One of the better comedy series I've seen.
Schitts Creek,hasn't even been 3 years since it went off the air. it makes you wonder why it did stop if it was so popular and the cast all seem crazy about working on it. it swept the emmys for the final season too. what gives?
Schitts Creek,I wouldn’t mind a short movie or an hour special if there’s a good concept but the show shouldn’t be continued
Schitts Creek,I was just driving yesterday thinking “i really wish theyd do a 3 or 4 episode special” just to help my winter depression
Schitts Creek,I'm happy just revisiting the series every year or so when I need to wrap myself up in a world that isn't quite so cold and hateful.
Schitts Creek,A Christmas special might be kinda cool.
Schitts Creek,I want more Stevie.
Schitts Creek,"One day I'll understand why people care more about a shows legacy than the potential for new, good content. Do you guys seriously enjoy the good parts of Arrested Development, The Simpsons, Scrubs or Futurama less just because they made some stuff later that kinda blew? 

The absolute worst thing that can happen when a sitcom gets brought back is you'll have to say ""you can stop watching after season x"" when you're telling people about it."
Schitts Creek,"He should do a sequel in his hometown Hamilton Ontario. Here, he's like the Micheal Jordan to Chicago.

He returns to his home town Hamilton, a run down blue collar dirty industrial city with old ties to the mob. He wants to revive the town and bring some class by opening a luxury hotel under the rose hotel brands. David expands to a secondary store next door and Alexis is their pr manager trying to popularize it to the locals and the wider world."
Schitts Creek,How abt an a “little bit Alexis” spinoff documenting all of her adventures either before or after schitts creek
Schitts Creek,Don’t you give me hope.
Schitts Creek,Dude is INSANELY funny. His timing is second to none. In interviews he and Dana Carvey have the quickest wits on the planet.
Schitts Creek,They should just do a Christmas Special every few years or something.
Schitts Creek,Oh please good yes! ☺️🇬🇧
Schitts Creek,When is he returning to the Sammy Maudlin Show?
Schitts Creek,I just need one scene - three years later when Ted moves back from the Galapagos and him and Alexis find each other again
Schitts Creek,"
Doesn't matter how great a show is; bringing it back doesn't always work out. We've had a gut full of revivals in recent years and the novelty has worn off. No, this wouldn't be a revival, but it's still a fine line between honouring what it was and not cheapening that.

And I say this as someone who would absolutely pine over Catherine O'Hara's Moira all over again if given the chance."
Schitts Creek,I both enjoyed this show and also think it's the most overrated show in years.
Schitts Creek,God yes please
Schitts Creek,One movie and done. Be careful.
Schitts Creek,Boop
Schitts Creek,Forget about that- when is the Bobby Bittman movie  coming out?
Schitts Creek,I’ve always hoped that they would come back and do some holiday specials
Schitts Creek,"So I loved the show, but I never really understood what it meant that they'd bought the town. Did they own all the buildings? The name? What did they buy? Could they have just sold the houses for money? It was never discussed!"
Schitts Creek,We’ve never stopped thinking Schitts creek about you either!
Schitts Creek,“We’ve never stopped thinking about making more money.”
Schitts Creek,Why mess with perfection?
Schitts Creek,So many great tv shows have the last 2 seasons be absolute ass. Please just try another project.
Schitts Creek,Is it just me or is Schitt’s Creek just Arrested Development but for the average television consumer?
Schitts Creek,"I never got past the first season. I love Levy and the cast and some of it was amusing, but it always felt like a poor man's Arrested Development to me. I've been told it only gets better but one season felt like enough time with those characters for me."
Schitts Creek,Most overrated show ever
Schitts Creek,This show was the schitt!
Schitts Creek,"Season 1 does make you wonder what all the fuss is about, and whether you should bother continuing…

…but wait! Before you reach for that remote, it's…

Seasons 2-4 wherein the writing, direction and performances transmogrify into the droll confection it's touted as being…

…but then…

Season 5 demonstrates how success can lead to pandering…

…whereupon…

Season 6 seems to have been written exclusively for Twittermemers."
Schitts Creek,"He does have a one-note son as far as talent.  So you can't blame him.  Like, Eugene Levy has been amazing for four decades and his son isn't worth a damn outside of this ridiculous show, so, makes sense."
Schitts Creek,The last season wasn't as funny as the rest so it definitely ended when it needed to. Please don't bring it back and ruin it.
Schitts Creek,They should. That show was boring as fuck. Great Value brand Arrested Development.
Schitts Creek,It ran its course. Started very strong but wasn't really good or funny anymore at the end. That said there's no such thing as too much Catherine O'Hara and if she wants to make more I would still watch.
Schitts Creek,Film one more season of Schitt's Creek WITHOUT your son because David was the most tiresome character in all of television history.
Schitts Creek,"No.

It was the perfect show and ended perfectly. Please for the love of God. Leave it alone. It will feel forced, fake and taint its perfectness."
Schitts Creek,"wasn't it over like, a year ago? ""once we finished it we started thinking about how to bring it back"" well then don't finish it, my man"
Schitts Creek,This show is *terrible*.
Schitts Creek,[removed]
Schitts Creek,Didn’t it just end? We don’t need more…
Schitts Creek,hes got a travel show on apple+ and all he does is bitch because hes not at home on his couch playing golf at his country club.  dude forgot where he came from.
Schitts Creek,Big tease
Schitts Creek,Don’t.  Marshal your family’s comedic talents into something new and snarky!  I include your cast and crew in “family.”  Just a delightful assemblage of personalities!
Schitts Creek,A Christmas special wouldn’t hurt it. Anything else would be over kill. Maybe a Christmas special every couple of years.
Schitts Creek,"Go do a different thing! It was great but now it's done, and now you can get going on more other stuff."
Schitts Creek,I love that for us
Schitts Creek,Ill take more. If it sucks ill stop watching and ignore it. Ive never really got the concept of something new somehow ruining the old. reboots/remakes have never changed my opinion on the previous film/show. Best case I get more good TV. Worst case is I watch something else. Win/Win
Schitts Creek,"It'd be a bad idea, but if they're going to anyway, my advice is to bring a Goddamn paddle this time."
Schitts Creek,"I honestly feel like they could get a good season 2 out of it. 
Moira and the filming of her Soap Opera. Johnny juggling the motel business and supporting Moira. 

Alexis alone in NY trying to make it as a PR and David with his husband in the small town."
Schitts Creek,Spin-off with David and Patrick raising a family. Thanks
Schitts Creek,Didn’t the show end barely a couple years ago? Can’t we wait til the corpse is cold before a hamfisted revival attempt?
Schitts Creek,"I mean, most of us are constantly up there with zero paddle action, not even fun paddle action."
Schitts Creek,I’d love them to do an in-character improv reunion show.
Schitts Creek,Have there been _any_ good revivals? Every attempt I've seen has fallen pretty flat.
Schitts Creek,DO! IT!
Schitts Creek,I thoroughly enjoyed it. But please don't bring it back. Let it be.
Schitts Creek,Reluctant traveler is fantastic. Apple TV+
Schitts Creek,Bro it’s been like 2 years
Schitts Creek,Please come back that would be epic
Schitts Creek,We need a prequel of teenage Alexis and David as the family struggles to fit in among their shallow and selfish peers in the 2000s era.
Schitts Creek,His glasses are a rich people fad which can't be over soon enough.
Schitts Creek,My first thought after watching the last episode was 'I wonder when it'll come back?'.
Schitts Creek,How to get easy clicks on an entertainment tag AND easy karma with this one weird trick! Pick a beloved actor from a popular show and plug it into this formula! “[Actor] says he/she’s not against another season of [series].”
Schitts Creek,"Don't, or if you do, do it well"
Schitts Creek,"The one gripe I have about the show is that Roland is irredeemably shitty except for his little speech to the CEO’s.

A reformed Roland Plot would have made it a 10/10 show for me."
Schitts Creek,Uhhhh I think we have enough reboots now. We're good
Schitts Creek,Love you Eugene and adore Schitts Creek but it ended at the perfect time. Let’s let this live on how it is.
Schitts Creek,Best show ever
Schitts Creek,"Don’t bother, it ended perfectly.

Perfect time perfect place perfect spot.

Maybe one Christmas or some such one off special, just show them settling into their new lives. But even then, the writing would have to be absolutely perfect."
Schitts Creek,"I hope they do more episodes, even if it's just the occasional special. I'm not ready to see goodbye to these characters."
Schitts Creek,It got me through covid
Schitts Creek,"It’s ok, Eugene, don’t feel like you have to. Really."
Schitts Creek,I want to see a Christmas episode where they spend time together now instead of how they were before it was all taken away.
Schitts Creek,"Ted and Alexis are the only reason I wouldn't want to see a reunion. I thought they ended in a really beautiful, open ended spot even if it was bittersweet. I want them to end up together as much as I think it was important for them not to end up together and I think that either way they tell it part of me will be disappointed. 

I feel like revisiting their story would feel like going backwards, whereas I can see logical continuations for just about every other character that won't feel like going backwards or retreading old ground."
Schitts Creek,"I know a lot of people are asking for a Christmas special, but I think it would be way better if they did a thanksgiving day special"
Schitts Creek,"Totally. Agree. 100%.

It KILLED me to see it end, but that was also part of what made it special. It was a flawless story, told flawlessly, with a flawless ending.

I’ve rewatched the series many times, and I will again. That said, the story they set out to tell was told, and the ending, albeit painful because I knew my journey with all the characters I had grown to love was coming to an end, was perfect."
Schitts Creek,Arrested Development is a good example. It had a good ending and then was brought back and was a huge disappointment.
Schitts Creek,My wish is for every cast that gets the urge to do a reunion series to instead make a podcast going back through the show.
Schitts Creek,I wouldn’t mind a movie. Not a whole tv season.
Schitts Creek,"You say that. But they made the show on a shoestring budget. I don't think they wanted to do what they really wanted. The CBC is infamous for being cheap. Maybe any Canadian can testify and elaborate. 

For me personally, I don't mind seeing a TV movie or a special one day."
Schitts Creek,"I think it would only work if it was done as a spin off and not a continuation of the Rose’s story.  Like if they followed Stevie navigating how to expand the Rosebud Group and then have David be a regular side character. But have the other Roses involved if it can be directly tied to Stevie’s story.  To steal an idea from Seinfeld it would make sense if Alexis came back in for a storyline because the streaming service she works for wants to make a show about her families story. (Show within the show about the show.)   Or like a Johnny coming back to help Stevie navigate the business world, or Moira doing a commercial.

I think if you try to make a show that continues to follow the Roses you inevitability have to ruin their happy ending or undermine their character growth and the original show in order to tell a compelling story.  Which then ruins the new story anyways."
Schitts Creek,"Agree with you. I wouldn't say no to a one off special, but they definitely ahouldnt bring it back proper"
Schitts Creek,"*Ew, David!* :("
Schitts Creek,"Ironically Arrested Development turned out to be like a comedic version of Fox’s popular teenage drama The O.C. At the time both shows centered on a family that ran a real estate business, and coincidentally in season two >!had a arch in which two characters dating each other turned out to be relegated. It wasn’t actually incest, since Ryan was adopted by the Cohens.!< One of the biggest similarities came at the start of season 2. >!Caleb Nichole, the founder of The Newport Group (a parody of The Irvine Company), was being investigated by Feds for illegally using company money for personal use.!<

EDIT: >!There is even a episode about Sandy Cohen trying to stop his father-in-law from starting development on the wetlands.!< Also, the biggest similarity is both shows are set in Newport, California."
Schitts Creek,"Yeah, but just like LotR, if it comes out bad, ignore it. I for one think they should do a feature length film, one final tie up so the audience can see how everyone is doing, and how they’ve grown. Maybe a Ted/Alexis wedding?

Edit: omg the shitts creek people interacting in the city might be a cute angle."
Schitts Creek,It’s the Gravity Falls of sitcoms. It didn’t overstay its welcome and left fans wanting more.
Schitts Creek,"i don't really care if anything is put back on as long as it's done well. I like the little worlds of TV shows and if they can keep it going and doing it well, then I'll keep watching. The key is not fucking it up...which is much easier said than done."
Schitts Creek,"Please Eugene you had a big hit. don't ""American Pie"" this."
Schitts Creek,No. Remember thing? Here's thing again. Fuck originality.
Schitts Creek,"> It's a show that ended at exactly the right time on exactly the right note just on the precipice of overstaying its welcome.

Handmaid's Tale would like a word.

Which is exactly why I agree with the Succession announcement."
Schitts Creek,"but otoh, if it's the same people working on it, there's no reason to think that newer seasons wouldn't reach that same bar of quality."
Schitts Creek,A show about a gay couple running a beauty shop in a small village maybe ?
Schitts Creek,Nah bring it back. You don't have to watch.
Schitts Creek,"Something I’d love for more shows to do are slot-in episodes that flesh out background characters that weren’t covered during the show. The revival wouldn’t take place after the series, but during it."
K,“What do they say about the Parthenon where the Acropolis is?”
K,I think he can pull of the same “gentle but disappointed dad” vibe that Alex had whenever no one got the right answer.
K,Hopefully there are no questions about the Parthenon.
K,Seems like a good fit.
K,"Well don't bogart the Fry, UK, we want some of that hosting goodness, too, now that you mention it!"
K,Does the UK even know what they're doing? Clearly they should be swapping hosting duties between Stephen Fry and James Corden.
K,"Can I just say my heart stopped reading this title because I thought it was going to be a death announcement for some reason, and I definitely couldn’t have handled that."

K,Has there ever been a UK version? I’m shocked it’s taken this long if not.
K,"He will be superb in that role, as he is in everything."
K,"🎶*I saw this thing on ITV the other week. Said that if she played with her hair, she's probably keen. She's playing with her hair well regularly. So I reckon I could well be in.*"
K,Fry probably doesn't need the answer key. Dude just knows everything.
K,…are they going to rotate him out with an anti-vaxxer every other week lien they do in the US?
K,Now I have to watch Jeopardy.
K,"Surely he's way too good for this sort of thing? This is like if David Attenborough hosted Total Wipeout. (Actually that would be amazing, never mind.)"
K,There is a second Jeopardy version?
K,What a waste of Stephen Fry.
K,"can we get him here in the US!!?? he’d be perfect!! we have two polarizing co-hosts and it’s not working out. it would be great to have someone more universally appealing. 

and now, the fanboy bullies will chime in about how Ken is soooooo amazing and then downvote. lame."
K,At some point after he'll be replaced by Sandi Toksvig and it will be better.
K,Good to see he's feeling up to taking on such a gig after his mental health struggles.
K,Alec Baldwin slapped a crumpet.
K,"Bloody hell Stephen, this better be good"
K,"""oh dear"""

K,Well done.
K,Featuring Hugh Laurie as Richard Ayoade's dad.
K,Fry could read my breakfast cereal ingredients and I'd watch.
K,My 8th grade history teacher Mr. Nece > Miam
K,"Nope.

The whole “write the answer as a question” thing seems entirely pointless and non-sensible. The host isn’t giving the answers to questions, they’re giving clues to answers. Nobody starts an answer to “Who is X?” with “This actor…”"
K,"Yeah, I used to watch it as a kid, along with other daytime game shows such as Crosswits, Chain Letters and more."
K,Always upvotes for the streets
K,Yep Piers Morgan will be on heavy rotation
K,"""And as we can see, John from Surrey has made it past The Sweeper, and so he is safe...

K,"There are many versions of Jeopardy! around the world. Currently, there are regional adaptations of Jeopardy! in Azerbaijan, Estonia, Germany, Poland, Slovakia, Turkey, and now the United Kingdom; and there have been adaptations of Jeopardy! in many other countries in the past.

K,I mean I dont know if you watch jeopardy but Ken Jennings was always the obvious successor of Trebek way before Alex died even.
K,"QI with Sandi is very good, but certainly not better."
K,Moving on.
K,***DEVESTATED***
K,"My favorite moment was when some quirky professor was a contestant and had blue hair and asymmetrical glasses. Alex enters, looks at him, exchanges smirks for a few seconds, and then goes “We’ll talk.”"
K,"Kinda reminds me of my Dad. 

He would(and still does) share stories about other people's lives, who he met through work, like a former NFL lineman from the undefeated Miami Dolphins squad; the guy who shot all the animals who are now on display at one of the Cabela's in Minnesota; a descendant of the guy who founded Pabst Blue Ribbon; etc 

But if you would see how he ended conversations you think he was a complete dick sometimes but he genuinely enjoyed learning a bit about everybody he would talk to he just didn't want to talk forever with you."
K,What do they say! What do they say?!

K,"Haha, was hoping someone would appreciate that silly reference."
K,"In absolute fairness to Piers Morgan (he is still an absolute cunt), he has absolutely nothing kind to say about anti-vaxxers"
K,hopefully on a spit
K,"I watched it since Alex’s very first show until his last. It’s a family tradition spanning four four generations now. Ken is not an obvious choice at all, which is why it’s not working out. reddit just loves him so all other opinions don’t matter. pointless of me to even bring it up in this hateful echo chamber."
K,FIGHT FIGHT FIGHT FIGHT FIGHT
K,That there are no straight lines

K,"So with the US version, six categories are presented at the start of a round - each category has five questions. In the first round, the clues are worth 200, 400, 600, 800, and 1000. The higher the $ amount, the more difficult the clue.


Someone might say ""Annual Events for $400""


They'll be read ""The largest U.S. independent film festival, it showcases new talents & movies each January in Utah""


Anyone can buzz in. Whoever buzzes in first can answer.


This happens until time runs out or the board is finished.


One of the clues on the board is a daily double - they can bet any amount they want on this question. They are the only person who can answer the clue - no need to buzz in.



After the Jeopardy round finishes, they go to the Double Jeopardy round - same deal, except the dollar amounts are doubled and there are two daily doubles.


After that finishes, everyone who has a positive amount of money gets to go to the Final Jeopardy round. These questions tend to be harder than any of the others in the game. They are shown a category, such as ""Historic Names"" and then they must write down bets (I think when filming, they get something like 5 minutes to do the math and figure out how much they should bet). After that, they are read a clue (such as ""DNA from 2 living descendants of Anne of York was used to identify the remains of this man"") - after 30 seconds have passed, their electronic pads disable and they cannot write anything else. The host starts with whoever entered with the lowest and reads their response. If they answered incorrectly, the hose says they are wrong, followed by how much they lost. If they answered correctly (""Who is Richard III"") - the host states that they are correct, how much they bet, and what their final score is. Whoever has the most is the champion of the day and goes onto the next day. The contestant with the second most gets $2000, and the third place gets $1000.


If they die, they go to a tiebreaker round - a category is shown and then a clue is read. Whoever buzzes in first and answers it correctly goes to the next show."
K,"Well I think he does a great job. Keeps the pace, and obviously knows the material most of the time. Reddit be damned."

The Captain was all of us kids' favorite Uncle; full of jokes and fun and interesting stuff to know.  Mr. Green Jeans and, if I'm remembering right, Mr. Allegretti was Mr. Painter.  These were happy, happy times.  The Captain's Christmas shows were little thills that got us kids building up to the Big Day.

Mother Goose Club,"My wife and I just reviewed Captain Kangaroo tonight on our podcast. Check it out! 

https://open.spotify.com/episode/1ufIOUb9Wfb9hehE8TH3DI?si=lN7jOT-rT76Pd4BOw6s7gA&utm_source=copy-link"
Mother Goose Club,Whoa!!! I never knew that! Don’t think my mom did either lol. That’s incredible! Thanks for sharing!
Mother Goose Club,"I tended to not watch and/or not pay attention to shows I didn't like when I was a kid, same as I do now"
Mother Goose Club,Cow and Chicken made me uncomfortable as a kid.
Mother Goose Club,I really didn't like Rocket Power b/c skateboarding (and whatever other sports they had on there) wasn't my thing.
Mother Goose Club,"I'm going to choose violence and say Doug. The fantasy scenes were fun, but almost every episode was just watching a bland kid having a panic attack over something that didn't end up mattering."
Mother Goose Club,Im really old so we only had about 4 hours of cartoons on Saturday morning and that was it. Not a lot of selection but I hated Pepe LaPew (?) the skunk that didn’t understand the word no. Even as a kid that pissed me off.
Mother Goose Club,"howie mendel  did have  cartoon show it was  so bad i really hated him 
 till this day still dont like him cant get past this one damm  cartoon show he did"
Mother Goose Club,Super friends with Wendy and Marvin. Ugh
Mother Goose Club,"Something about my mental makeup made me instantly hate anything that was clearly pandering to sell toys, which included shows like He-Man, GI-Joe, Transformers/Gobots etc. I grew up on old school cartoons, and basically skipped the 80s until I found Anime/OVAs in the early 90s. The exception to that would be Battle of the Planets which aired locally for me around 1983, but I didn't know enough to link it to it's source in Japan until much later.

Then of course the renaissance started with Liquid Television and Ren & Stimpy."
Mother Goose Club,"I honestly can’t think of one. But I was a kid in the 70s and early 80s. The only animated stuff I could never get down with aired on adult swim in the 90s. Like Moral Orel and that weird CGI show with some hairy guy with a snake for a hand that thought he was an Angel. 

Actually if I’m being honest, past the anime? Adult swim mostly sucked. Especially when they started airing all that live action crap. Tim and Eric, Tom goes to the mayor, The heart she holler. 

Not funny. Not cartoons.

Edit: that being said? As a little kid?  I LOVED my little pony. But it was different in the 80s. I also loved He-Man. Gem and the Misfits, Glow-worms, Care-bears, Rainbow Bright, Strawberry Shortcake, She-ra Thunder-Cats, GIJOE, Puffalumps, Tiny-Toons, ANIMANIACS, Rock-n-Rule, anything Disney, The Last Unicorn, The Hobbit, Dungeons and Dragons, The Last of the Red Hot Dragons, The Devil and Daniel Mouse, anything airing as a weekend special from Japan, The list goes on and on and on. 

Mostly I just love anything and everything animation. If it’s done right. 

It’s not about the fan base. It’s about the art."
Mother Goose Club,"Ren and Stuidty, I found it gross.

And that show from Canada that was stop motion with photos of middle school kids."
Mother Goose Club,"Can't say I hated any cartoons. I just didn't watch if I wasn't interested. I was generally biased for action cartoons though. If there was any kind of animated violence, then it was guaranteed I would watch it, LOL. Someone in here mentioned they hated the toyetic stuff in the 80s. I WAS ALL OVER THAT CRAP. Because they usually had a good helping of shooting and violence and other stuff that's ""bad for kids"", which of course means it was something kids HAD to watch. That's probably the reason why I'm one of the least qualified people to pull the ""Think of the CHILDREN!"" line today when it comes to trying to be the moral police. I watched all sorts of junk when I was a kid, and I'm glad my parents didn't care."
Mother Goose Club,I didn't start out hating Scooby Doo but they played the same 25-30 episodes on Saturday morning for my entire childhood (late 70s - mid 8os) so I got really tired of it over the years.
Mother Goose Club,"As a kid though, you had to suffer through the commercials advertising them. If you also only had access to a few channels and the only stuff airing were the shows you didn't like and reruns for shows that you've already seen, your only option was to turn off the TV and figure out something else to do instead."
Mother Goose Club,So you had cable? Lucky you!
Mother Goose Club,"Agreed on everything other than the Adult Swim part; I especially love animation in general, but some of Adult Swim's live-action shows are great (*especially* Tim & Eric). Also, Tom Goes to the Mayor technically was animated..."
Mother Goose Club,"Oh most certainly! Lots of channels, but like, even then, there was nothing on hahaha. Cable, with regards to cartoons only, as a kid meant you got Nick and MTV for me, although both had a lot of live actions stuff too, as a kid I didn't really care if it was real or a cartoon, I liked both.  I was never a Disney kids/teens shows fan, nor cartoon network.  But also locals channels usually showed kids blocks in the after school hours, and some in the mornings 6-8, before they were mostly all replaced with news/talk."
Mother Goose Club,"Growing up, I only had 4 channels and only 2 had cartoons. I had to watch what was available. I watched crap like Count Duckula and Danger Mouse. Ugh, there was nothing else."
Mother Goose Club,"While HBO Velma is an indisputably awful show, I commend your efforts to try to fix it. You actually tried to make the race changes matter and I respect that. Representation coming from the heart is a good quality to have.

> most would expect him to be a pompous, arrogant, incompetent brat. But Fred turned out to be a natural born leader. He was handsome, charismatic, and understanding. 

Also, definitely already better than what they did to Fred in the show."
Mother Goose Club,[deleted]
Mother Goose Club,"Shout out to Jimmy and Kim (Better Call Saul). I find the relationship at times very sweet and other times very frustrating. Mostly, thanks to the circumstance that its a prequel, I'm very interested in how it turns out given that Kim is not in Breaking Bad. I feel like I'm dreading the outcome, but that question alone keeps me hooked."

Mother Goose Club,Will Graham and Hannibal Lecter. They have such a chemistry together it’s amazing to watch. Although it’s deeply unhealthy you just want to see these two straight guys kiss more than anything by the end.
Mother Goose Club,Francis Urquhart and Elizabeth Urquhart - House of Cards (UK)
Mother Goose Club,Tom Wambsgans and Greg Hirsch.
Mother Goose Club,"Dan and Roseanne Connor are the best TV couple of all time.

 I have some friends that remind me of this couple. As annoying as Roseanne is, she's not unbearable like most TV wives. Dan's not portrayed as a moron.. The couple has an unmatched chemistry that isn't normally found on television.

The drama that the two went through felt real. As  loud and annoying as they were, they weren't constantly nagging at each other about petty shit. Neither came off as ungrateful for the other.

Dan doesn't treat Roseanne like she's a moron. Roseanne doesn't demand constant attention from him. Dan's not constantly scheming to pull one over on Roseanne. She's not trying to make him into the man she thinks he can be and lets him be the man that she is.

The only ""flaw"" in their characters is they're not attractive. They're middle aged fatties from the midwest.

The most enduring quality in this couple is the fact that the love the characters have for each other really comes through the TV screen. Unlike Ray and Debora, Penny and Leonard, Ross and Rachel, Doug and Kerri, or any other TV couple you're not left wondering WTF do they see in each other. They're a perfect match for each other."
Mother Goose Club,I skipped the scene where Logan died so in my mind Logan is still alive forever :'(

All‘s well that ends well because leeta ended up being the wife of the Nagus 😜😂😜"
Mother Goose Club,which series are they from??
Mother Goose Club,why'd you say that? 😕
Mother Goose Club,"This would be a perfectly fine relationship if Tony would just let her fuck Furio.  He fucks around constantly with sometimes entirely random women but the like two times she has the hots for another dude it’s like the greatest betrayal of all time.

She also needs to shut up about his dangerous career. She didn’t marry a mild mannered chemistry teacher. She doesn’t really get to complain that the monster she chose to marry fully aware he was a monster is a monster."
Mother Goose Club,lol really?? Tony's a piece of shit who cheats on her constantly.
Mother Goose Club,"Why post if you don't care for people's opinions? Why is it that you can post your opinion and it's worthy of being posted, but when anyone else posts theirs it is ""mindless""?"
Mother Goose Club,"> Lucas and Siobhan (Banshee)

Oh good one I forgot about."
Mother Goose Club,That's messed up right?
Mother Goose Club,"""Of all time"" and the oldest show on there was Freaks and Geeks with most being so recent as to be shown or produced by Streaming Services."
Mother Goose Club,"She’s not fully aware she’s a monster herself.

She thinks she’s staying with Tony because of religion."
Mother Goose Club,"OP asked for the BEST couples, not the most perfect ones."
Mother Goose Club,"Nah i didn't say i don't care (in fact i do).... just that i wasn't expecting it (since usually when i post stuff like this it's crickets). And i say ""mindlessly"" because they just comment the name of the couples.... without saying about else about them, some even without adding the name of the shows. 🤷"
Mother Goose Club,"lol as i said in the first sentence, the title is a hyperbole. obviously this is just my list of favourites."
Mother Goose Club,Well that's what she TELLS herself.
Mother Goose Club,I love when that therapist tells her in no uncertain terms that she needs to fucking leave.  “No I wanted the solution where all my problems magically go away but I get to keep all my cool shit!”
Mother Goose Club,"hehe yeah but by ""best"" i definitely meant couples i actually loved seeing together and wanted to stay together. Carmela was... 😪 idk. I can't say I agree with all her decisions in that relationship, she needed to get away from Tony! But i guess her portrayal was pretty genuine."
Mother Goose Club,Thought that was all copy and paste from the article.  My bad.
Mother Goose Club,wha.... what article? nah i typed all that up myself lol.
Mother Goose Club,I think there is something to how Al Bundy himself has become an icon for disgruntled white people that did not get the joke he was kicking them
Mother Goose Club,This analysis is unnecessary and obvious.  The show is a satire.  It’s like writing an article about how The Colbert Report was everything that was wrong about Fox News; that was the point.  Also Roseanne debuted a year after MWC and All in the Family 15 years prior.
Mother Goose Club,psycho daaad
Mother Goose Club,"""dysfunctional family"" is also a trope.

[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DysfunctionalFamily](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DysfunctionalFamily)

>The entire premise for many Dom Coms is that the lead characters are a family of maladjusted people who generally don't get along. Usually they consist of a Jaded Washout and/or Bumbling Dad father, a mother who is either a paragon of common sense and efficiency or a repulsive harridan (or both, a la Roseanne), and two-four kids who are unhappy, dislike each other, and resent at least one of their parents. Also, the father and his mother-in-law tend to hate each other. The family is generally fairly poor, although not always — Arrested Development is about a large, rich dysfunctional family. And even they won't remain wealthy. (It was seized by the government.)"
Mother Goose Club,"Actually, they couldn't have afforded that house with just Al working in a shoe store.    One person working basic retail 40 hours a week can generally barely stay afloat renting a crap apartment.  

Al could be a pig, but Peggy did NOTHING.  He wanted her to get a job, if I recall it correctly."
Mother Goose Club,Not sure why this is being downvoted. I lot of us have an understanding about why this show was successful and why it’s important to television history. But you still did a great job of breaking it down.
Mother Goose Club,They did an All in the Family remake set in in the nineties but somehow forgot that were supposed to be laughing *at* the grumpy old patriarch that not only refuses to accept the future but rails against it. When this grown ass adult creates a No Girls Allowed club were supposed to feel bad about what a loser he is.  But somehow a fan base popped up like “I love this dude and everything he says.”
Mother Goose Club,Agreed!
Mother Goose Club,"Pot, meet kettle."
Mother Goose Club,"Uh huh, I’m sure it is. But let’s discuss it anyways."
Mother Goose Club,"Of course it's a Tv trope, but your examples, except Schitt's Creek aren't the best.

Eastenders and Coronation are soap operas and The Crown is based on the Royal Family."
Mother Goose Club,"Not really.

For example: despite all his flaws, Al never cheated on his wife, despite all their problems, A; and Peggy never got divorced, and despite their money problems, the Bundy's lived in the same neighborhood as two bankers.

Any breakdown should compare this to All in the Family where the premise is that the daughter and her husband can't afford their own place and are forced to live with Archie Bunker."
Mother Goose Club,"Thank you, I appreciate that!"
Mother Goose Club,"Yeah, it turns out that a lot of people could relate to that! Al Bundy was essentially the average, married white male in America. Honestly, it still feels like it today too."
Mother Goose Club,No need.
Mother Goose Club,"> despite their money problems, the Bundy's lived in the same neighborhood as two bankers.

This is actually representative of its time. Neighborhoods were often much more economically diverse before the middle was torn out of everything by outsourcing and other forces."
Mother Goose Club,"I lived in that time. And no, Married With Children was not an accurate depiction of the social and economic situation in the 1980s, nor was it trying to be.

Don't mistake a sitcom for a documentary."
Mother Goose Club,"So did I, and yeah, we definitely had a much wider variety of economic statuses in the neighborhood than you'll find now. Nowhere in there did I say it was a documentary."
Mother Goose Club,"Which is irrelevant.

I made a specific point: it makes no sense that a four person family with the single income of a man who works in a shop that isn't doing great, would live in the same neighborhood as two professionals without children.

Compare to Rosanne, set in the same time were the family needs a two person income to afford to live in a reasonable sized house.

There is economic status and the reality that in the 1980s / 1990s a low-paying job cannot support a family of four and a large house with a garden, a basement, and a garage."
Mother Goose Club,"Yawn. Watch the show maybe.  They literally say that the Bundys house brings down the property values of their neighbors,  who hate them."
Spaced,Didn't Bob Iger just a few days ago say that he'd be leaning harder on core Disney franchises like Marvel to push Disney+?
Spaced,Quality > quantity.
Spaced,"The amount of content coming out on Disney+ is pretty slow already, only reason I stay subscribed is because I get it for cheap.

edit: some grammar"
Spaced,[deleted]
Spaced,The fact Agatha has a show is hilarious lol
Spaced,"Or...you know...hire better writers, figure out your story-endings before postproduction & 
stop treating VFX studios like expendable slaves. That'll do the trick."
Spaced,Oh they need more time in between all these six-episode-can-barely-be-called-a-series tv shows? Damn.
Spaced,Seems to coincide with a pending WGA strike.
Spaced,can they try making shows that are actually good too?
Spaced,"If theyre going to keep with the 6 episodes at maybe 30min formula then ill care even less than before. Their shows are so laser focused and short its over by the time there is anything barely caring about. Id love to see more Jessica Jones or Daredevil, but im worried they just be as pathetically short"
Spaced,I mean it’s already been a solid 3 months since She-Hulk ended and we still have no word on a release date for Secret Invasion. I thought it was obvious they’re spacing things out.
Spaced,"They're too slow already IMO. There was a burst of them near launch, and they dried up to nothing months later."
Spaced,"Makes sense, I think the pandemic pushed them into overdrive a bit.

Probably 2 shows a year would be the right spot"
Spaced,"> But I do think there is something fun about leaning back and watching an episode that can be relatively self-contained.

> Lost was an incredibly influential show because it was this serialized story, which was not seen in television much. Now it's been how long, 20 years? Since then, almost everything has become like that. So now — and I think you're seeing this not just with our shows, but with many other shows — you're starting to see the fun of a self-contained, episodic story week to week. We're going to experiment with that in some of our upcoming things.

I'd definitely love a Monster of the Week type show!"
Spaced,It doesn't matter if they're 2-3 years apart if they're still garbage content.
Spaced,"Just give me more shows like Andor and fewer shows like everything else on D+

More intelligent, quality writing. For the love of god, please give me better dialogue in these shows."
Spaced,"Not terribly surprising. I think the audience probably has the appetite for all this content, so I suspect it's more about budget. 

Between Bob Chapek's financial chicanery, frontloading for D+, VFX pipelines, competition, and the economy, a course correction was inevitable."
Spaced,they shouldve to begin with tbh
Spaced,"We don’t need more slow down, we need better quality"
Spaced,"Pretty sure the damage is done already.   Initial pace of content released for Marvel was incredibly high for Disney plus.   

Way too much.   Normal people don't have that kind of time"
Spaced,"Another interesting takeaway is that Feige seems to be distancing Marvel from their “movie told in 6 parts” television strategy too. Seems there’s more of an interest in episodic story telling (similar to the Mandalorian or Star Trek).

Great news too. Very tired of a singular story awkwardly chopped into parts, like Falcon and the Winter Soldier or Moon Knight."
Spaced,Im moving on from MCU! It’s run its course.
Spaced,"Uhhhh… there hasn’t been a new show on Disney+ for 6 months… unless something new besides She-Hulk: Attorney at Law came out.  What are they going to drop down to two shows/seasons a year?

In four years Marvel TV / ABC / Netflix figured out how to do three seasons of Daredevil, three seasons of Jessica Jones, two seasons of The Punisher, two seasons of Luke Cage, two seasons of Iron Fist…AND eight episodes of the Defenders.  

That’s 161 episodes in 4 years.  Not only that, each episode was an hour long! 

Each of the seasons of Moon Night, Falcon & Winter Soldier, Ms Marvel, She-Hulk, Loki, and What If? (Animated) has been less than 10 episodes and as low as 6.  All told in two years they have produced 57 episodes of content.  I haven’t ran the total runtime numbers.  But the episodes from Disney+ are noticeably shorter for most series."
Spaced,"Glad to hear it, now I only need to get D+ for 2 months tops a year to see a years worth of content! I agree, quality>quantity, but the thing is, if they want me to pay for it 12 months a year, I want both. Most of the D+ shows are 6-8 episodes, or 6-8 hours of viewing. I can EASILY watch the  6-8 D+ shows along with 4-6 movies a year I'm interested in in 2 months while still fitting in re-watching an old show or two, and then switch to HBOMax to for 2 months to see their entire years worth of content, then Para+ for 2 months, then Netflix for 2 months,  then PeaCock for 2 months, and then I'm set and still save money!

These companies all want their own streaming services so maximize profit. Well, I want to maximize my value, and none of these services put out enough content a year to rationalize paying for an entire year. That is how us as customers break these crappy practices. Companies care about profit over customers and are seemingly forgetting neither are guaranteed."
Spaced,Anyone get marvel fatigue ?
Spaced,But what else am I gonna watch?
Spaced,So less reason to keep Disney+? So confusing.
Spaced,"I’m happy with the MCU, it’s lightning in a bottle and something that won’t be replicated with the same quality for decades after it wraps up.

My only gripe is that it feels like we were introduced to Kang too early. Majors has the weight of being the big bad until 2026."
Spaced,"Sometimes I forget I’ve watched some of them. Specific moments stand out in my memory (like Kingpin’s introduction, or Falcon fully becoming Captain America) but I find myself saying “oh yeah i did see (show)” only She-Hulk really completely sticks with me the most for how wild and out there it was (and Daredevil’s return to the small screen)"
Spaced,"Maybe I'm in the minority but I was thoroughly enjoying the shows, and the amount of shows coming. The spaces in between are some of the worst, I can't imagine less and spacing them out more. Disney+'s release pipeline is already way to thin..."
Spaced,"No thanks, keep them coming, I want more!"
Spaced,Time to quit Disney +
Spaced,It's not superhero fatigue. Feige. It's the quality of the stuff you're putting out.
Spaced,"Shows outside Marvel franchise are not very successful. They need new, fresh content that can have many seasons. Not limited series that you can watch in one sitting. Quantity is important too. I mostly watch older series on D+, because the few premiere shows that are now streaming are not that good."
Spaced,"make the shows better please. a couple have been excellent, and some have been atrocious."
Spaced,Thank god. Idk how many more marvel shows and movies I can put up with at this point. I love my boyfriend but dear god the superhero thing is getting *old*
Spaced,Let's see if this improves the the VFX and labor practices in that industry
Spaced,Marvel Disney+ shows ruined the franchise
Spaced,Can you make them good too?
Spaced,Preferably less TV shows and more specials imo
Spaced,I’m so sick of super hero shit
Spaced,And reduce the cost to reflect the lower amount of product received? Just kidding of course not.
Spaced,Boo
Spaced,Because they aren't afraid of DCU catching up.
Spaced,"Last year had 3 MCU shows, 2023 right now has 6 shows confirmed...so they should probably update that."
Spaced,"Ok well if there's not something on it new for at least 1 week every month, I'll just start canceling it when I don't need it."
Spaced,why? there is nothing to watch on disney plus.  shouldn't they keep pumping out new show?
Spaced,Unsubscribe and then just do a month of subscription every 4 months or so.
Spaced,More Hawkeye pls   After Jeremy heals up
Spaced,Please! And quit announcing upcoming films/shows and make us anticipate what’s next during the credits’ scene like in Phase 1. There’s no more magic.
Spaced,Good. Guys went fucking crazy this past cycle
Spaced,I just want toon Disney shows man.
Spaced,To keep people subscribed.
Spaced,No.
Spaced,Sure way to kill it!! It’s too slow already!
Spaced,"Just keep pumping them out. Have yet to sit down and watch anything past the Avengers, but am stoked to one day do so.

Maybe I’ll save it all for retirement 🤷‍♂️"
Spaced,"Honestly, all streaming services (and movie studios for that matter) need to do this. I don't have the chance to get hyped for a show before it's already came and went and so did 3 others. And 4 more are set to release in a few months (hyperbole, but you catch my drift).

Gone are the summers where a few blockbusters come out that everyone wants to see. All studios want a piece of your attention and will bombard you with content until you submit or give up."
Spaced,Is that A Train?
Spaced,Who's buying puts on Disney?
Spaced,X for doubt.
Spaced,"Marvel is now adopting a ""less is more"" approach. Which is reasonable, since they were oversaturating the market. But this is also the way Star Wars went. It is a sign that things are not going to so well."
Spaced,More stuff like mandalorian and less like she-hulk please.
Spaced,I thought that was A-train in the corner
Spaced,i was looking at this for 5 minutes wondering why there is a picture of A-Train
Spaced,We went through three stages of the marvel cinematic universe and I didn't even notice.
Spaced,I’d be happy with a trickle and then nothing altogether.
Spaced,"Slow it down to a stop and figure some shit out cause damn Marvel has been bad lately. 

They're currently trying to make Fantastic Four which is incredibly challenging and almost always turns out shitty."
Spaced,I had super hero fatigue a decade ago. It's too much.
Spaced,I can’t extendedly wait for more terrible product to show up…
Spaced,So glad to hear this! We’ve been missing the anticipation of the next thing.
Spaced,So vomiting out as much low quality content as physically possible wasn’t a good decision? I’m shocked!
Spaced,Has he thought about making good shows?
Spaced,"I’m so burnt out of Marvel, I’d rather see some new Star Wars content like Andor."
Spaced,Took em long enough to realise less is more and quality should always come before quantity
Spaced,"Phase 4 was a wet fart in a plastic bag.

The MCU is practically dead. Star Wars is so dead its already been eaten by the worms. Disney need to stop ruining treasured franchises.

Indiana Jones is next"
Spaced,Good. I can't keep up with all of the shows and movies. Starting to rank and watch according to importance.
Spaced,Saw that coming from a mile away. Wouldn't surprise me if we don't see Avengers 5 and 6 until after 2027
Spaced,Maybe hire some new writers and stop shoehorning in the ideology of the day. Stick to telling stories ffs.
Spaced,"Best Marvel shows were on Netflix. Since it moved to Disney it's been middle of the road crap.

What I liked about Jessica Jones in particular was that it was part of that universe, but felt far more grown up. That is the value of having distinct formats contributing to a unified universe.

Now everything is too choreographed. There's no point of difference. And Disney has shat out loads and loads of content that ultimately feels very similar. It feels pointless and bland."
Spaced,"\- Stop hiring Rick & Morty writers. I don't know why Feige seems obsessed with them but they need to go.  
\- Most of the Disney+ shows have been middling at best. Slowing down on them is one thing but actually making them good is another.  
\-CG. I get it. It's important in building these fantastic worlds and often time easier than practical locations but *everything* being done on a green screen is dull.  
\-Embrace street level heros more. (Daredevil yay!) Not every character needs to be in the avengers (or should want to be)"
Spaced,"Slowing things down means we can start viewing these shows/series as the bigger events they are that can be shared with the family. It’ll be easier to stay caught up as well, because the idea that you may not understand something in the big theatrical releases because you didn’t watch a show, but there’s so many shows now, kind of sucks.

I feel bad for anybody trying to jump in at this point."
Spaced,"All of this has just become so exhausting to keep up with. This overlap between television and movies sounds good in theory, but I... just can't get myself to care. It was one thing when Falcon and Winter Soldier essentially ended where it started (Falcon is Captain America, so watching any movie where Sam Wilson is featured won't have much of a difference between having seen the show and not) but I would've been utterly confused watching Doctor Strange 2 if I hadn't seen Wandavision. 

I think I've mostly been lucky in that the only other show* that I bothered to watch was Loki so the multiverse element is richer than if I hadn't seen it (though I guess No Way Home can still act as a good primer for this), but I just look at the rest of these shows and say... eh...

We're already at a point where the movies are simultaneously not putting together coherent trilogies but also not acting as linear progressions of a larger Phase story, and it's just kind of becoming too ridiculous to focus on.

*okay, I also watched She Hulk, but that mostly seemed like it was going to be entirely detached from Marvel at-large."
Spaced,"I have been oversaturated by Marvel since Endgame, basically. It seems like there are several properties i havent seen yet. sometimes i hear about one that's out that i havent even heard of.

It's too much! We have lives, you know! (Not really, but still)"
Spaced,Its called the M-She-U now
Spaced,"A good move. Rushing productions and creative teams has clearly taken a toll on the studio's results. 

While they still have a some great IP's and good shows, many of the last few years shows and movies have felt rushed and slapped together at times."
Spaced,"I just wish they could maintain something interesting to watch 52 weeks of the year, once a week."
Spaced,"I always felt the super hero fatigue talking point was introduced as propaganda to permit them to slow everything down and increase their margins. A casual viewer could have just paced themselves to avoid it. Now instead of having one hour of tv a week to look forward to, Disney can be like the “people have spoken and we must air law and order reruns to appease the masses and we have to increase the sub fee to keep pace with inflation”."
Spaced,"Finally. It was a bad idea, thematically speaking, to ramp up the amount of content after endgame. I understand why they did it from a business standpoint, but for me it has greatly diminished my interest in the MCU"
Spaced,That’s actually a good thing. They are pushing it way too much and quality went downhill.
Spaced,"Honestly these things needed to happen anyway because talk of ""superhero fatigue"" is only growing stronger, not to mention the fact Marvel was already starting to scrape the bottom of the barrel as far as A and B tier heroes. I'm assuming with the coming of Secret Wars they're going to wipe the slate clean so they take a pause for a beat, then bring back some of the early MCU characters in new series with new actors."
Spaced,"Good, not every breakout character needs a spin-off."
Spaced,"I don’t get Disney plus. It has such little content, dialing back content doesn’t seem to be a good long term move"
Spaced,"Maybe slow down on movies?? The last marvel movie i saw in theaters was Love and Thunder and the last one I enjoyed was no way home. With Quantumania coming up that’s at least two movies since them and I’ve just completely lost interest. As others have said, try focusing on quality, not quantity."
Spaced,"I’ll probably be alone with that opinion, but imo the quality has been steadily decreasing since 2014-2016. Ragnarok’s success made them include the same slapstick humor in everything, and that took a lot of joy from the MCU. I liked the contrasts. Steve sincere way versus Tony’s jokes, versus Thor’s pathos. Nowadays, everyone has Tony’s humor, and there is no sincerity or pathos to be found. A soup doesn’t taste without salt, but neither does to taste when there is nothing but salt."
Spaced,Hopefully they focus on what made phase 1-3 gold (other than a few missteps here and there )… Rather than the post endgame trash that phase 4 has been
Spaced,That isnt going to help if they are still steaming piles of dogshit when they hit the air is it?
Spaced,"From a practical point of view, it's possible they were only able to make six hours of content (including credits) but literally none of those shows should have been six hours of contents (including credits), and the fact they all are is the actual problem with most of them.^1 

The thing is... I don't buy that argument. The plan was always six hours of content.

None of the problems with these shows can be fixed by spacing them out more. Badly structured plots are badly structured plots whether there's a month of seven years between them.


^1 What If being the exception."
Spaced,Oh cool.  Another platform making me wait 1-2 weeks between episodes. No thanks I'll wait until it's released and illegally download it instead.
Spaced,"Now if only he could slow down the wokeness that he pushes at expense of the characters that should be used, he could prioritize the plots instead of the nonsense we get just to feature Ms Marvel or Mahershala Ali in a pointless movie they didn't even have planned. (gasp, I made hatespeech on this godforsaken sub)"
Spaced,"I don’t care about the quantity if they can have quality but it’s not there. 

Marvel had arguably 1 great series with Loki.

Star Wars had 1 great show with Andor and mando being close to great. 

The rest ranged from good to bad with most leaning towards bad. 

They need a new leader for the Star Wars universe and maybe feige needs to pass the torch to someone more passionate."

Marvel Anime: Wolverine,"Details:

>The 1990s “X-Men: The Animated Series” is getting a revival on Disney+ with a premiere sometime 2023, TheWrap has exclusively learned.

>Currently called “X-Men ’97,” the revival will pick up where the classic show left off, with several cast members from “X-Men: The Animated Series” are returning; some will reprise their original roles and others will step into entirely new roles.  
>**Returning cast members include: Cal Dodd, Lenore Zann, George Buza, Adrian Hough, Christopher Britton, Catherine Disher, Chris Potter, Alison Sealy-Smith, Alyson Court.**  
>“X-Men ‘97” is also welcoming a number of new voices to the cast, including Jennifer Hale, Anniwaa Buachie, Ray Chase, Matthew Waterson, JP Karliak, Holly Chou, Jeff Bennett, AJ LoCascio."
Marvel Anime: Wolverine,Oh hell ya. This was my childhood! The theme song is still ingrained in my brain; so good.
Marvel Anime: Wolverine,Hopefully this is a major success. I’d love if Disney also revived the 90s Spider-Man cartoon since it never got complete closure.
Marvel Anime: Wolverine,I hope its done in similar 2d animation style.
Marvel Anime: Wolverine,"The names Gambit, remember it!"
Marvel Anime: Wolverine,"Dear God please do ONSLAUGHT and AGE OF APOCALYPSE.  In fact, all of the Fabian Nicieza and Scott Lobdell issues.  

Also curious which animation house they're using."
Marvel Anime: Wolverine,"""Hey Tin Woodsman! I'm sending you back to Oz, in pieces!""

""COWARDS! ALL OF EM! Tell Cyclops I made him a convertible."""
Marvel Anime: Wolverine," “You know what happens when I touch somebody.  You wanna end up in the hospital?”

“Maybe it’s worth it, no?”"
Marvel Anime: Wolverine,God help them if they change a single note of that theme song.
Marvel Anime: Wolverine,Wow okay. Not a “new series”. Honestly this is a cool idea. The original series adapted some really great arcs and going off of that with budget could be awesome. I do hope if they change anything is “Make Jean Grey not useless”. Though if this is post Phoenix Saga it should be fine.
Marvel Anime: Wolverine,The intro theme song is peak 90s.
Marvel Anime: Wolverine,This show suffered from really poor animation outsourcing in the later season but that never stops me from rewatching the whole series
Marvel Anime: Wolverine,*Badass theme tune intensifies*
Marvel Anime: Wolverine,Just keep the same theme song
Marvel Anime: Wolverine,Is this the one with the excellent guitar intro music?
Marvel Anime: Wolverine,"This news was first broken yesterday (but now it's official) so I'm just going to copy my comment from there:

> Never watched the original but I fondly remember X-Men Evolution from my childhood and I think it's the first superhero show I ever watched, so I'm excited for this. I should probably get around to watching the original as well.

Didn't know it was actually going to be a direct continuation, now I have to watch the original. Also, it's insane how when you see ""2023"" it feels like it's ages away but it's just over a year."
Marvel Anime: Wolverine,Can Jean not be useless this time?
Marvel Anime: Wolverine,Biggest news of the day by far
Marvel Anime: Wolverine,"The pure excitement I felt for a moment there...THIS is the X-Men I grew up with, nothing has ever been as cool. 

Semi-related, does anyone remember Mutant X? That was the weirdest X-Men-adjacent projects I can remember, I would love to find that streaming somewhere."
Marvel Anime: Wolverine,Let’s fucking go
Marvel Anime: Wolverine,The greatest cartoon opening song ever.
Marvel Anime: Wolverine,Absolutely LOVED that theme song. I can still hear it in my head!
Marvel Anime: Wolverine,I'll be happy only if Tim from Heartland voices Gambit.
Marvel Anime: Wolverine,They better not touch that fucking theme song
Marvel Anime: Wolverine,"The 90s show was great, kind of bummed they didn't revive Wolverine and the X-Men or Spectacular Spider-Man instead though as both of those shows got cancelled prematurely while the 90s X-Men story at least had a good run and an ending."
Marvel Anime: Wolverine,Gimme gimme Age of Apocalypse...
Marvel Anime: Wolverine,"The theme song went harder than it had any right to, and it has been stuck in my head since the 1990's."
Marvel Anime: Wolverine,Hopefully they keep the intro song.
Marvel Anime: Wolverine,Does it have to pick up AFTER the series? I recall Season 5 was poor quality in animation and voice acting. I wouldn't mind if they redid some of those episodes.
Marvel Anime: Wolverine,"If they don’t include gambit like so many mainstream x-men things that came out since the original cartoon, I’m going to dress up like gambit and terrorize the town. It’s going to make me look like a real loser, so I hope they include him so I don’t have to go through with that."
Marvel Anime: Wolverine,Finally. When was the last time we got an X-Men cartoon? 10 years ago?
Marvel Anime: Wolverine,The theme song better have that wicked chime at the end.
Marvel Anime: Wolverine,Now tell HBOMAX to do Batmam the Animated series.
Marvel Anime: Wolverine,Better keep the same intro song
Marvel Anime: Wolverine,The theme song has been my ringtone for months. Looking forward to this!
Marvel Anime: Wolverine,[deleted]
Marvel Anime: Wolverine,GAMBIT + ROGUE FOREVER
Marvel Anime: Wolverine,I hope they don't air episodes in a random order like the original. The most disjointed Animated series known to man: X-Men.
Marvel Anime: Wolverine,"Wild to bring this back, that's pretty exciting."
Marvel Anime: Wolverine,hopefully some sounds like cyclops from the original series
Marvel Anime: Wolverine,Please bring back the Spider-Man cartoon next!
Marvel Anime: Wolverine,"Jean?!  
https://youtu.be/NRwkcV1VL7k"
Marvel Anime: Wolverine,This is the series that got me into comics.  I love this series so goddamn much.  I still love seeing Wolverine hit his shoulder running through that door in the opening.
Marvel Anime: Wolverine,"I'm excited for this, but how can it pick up where the 90s series finished when that last season made little sense at all?"
Marvel Anime: Wolverine,Better have the same theme song..
Marvel Anime: Wolverine,"Dinna dinna daaa di don   
Dinna dinna daaaa di da"
Marvel Anime: Wolverine,"I legit believe that anything under Disney's umbrella with a decent following is never going to end now, unless the creators really want it to on their own terms (and even then I'm not sure Disney would let it end, like if the Simpsons production decided that they were done making new episodes tomorrow, that would not be last we heard from that franchise regardless)."
Marvel Anime: Wolverine,"I am super pumped for this. My one concern is the potential copyright situation with the intro song. 

YT: https://youtu.be/myjcUldWHNQ

Check out the comments for more context."
Marvel Anime: Wolverine,Jean! Scott! Jean! Scott!
Marvel Anime: Wolverine,"I hope they don't change those corny but great sound effects. This doesn't need to be a remastered version. It just needs to be upgraded for modern visuals but keep the same spiritual look. The OST should remain the same. The sound effects of Gambit's kinetic card, Wolve's claws, the Sentinel's voices, etc."
Marvel Anime: Wolverine,"“You really like cards”. “I like solitaire ok, unless I got someone to… play with”"
Marvel Anime: Wolverine,Don't you dare change or update the intro music.
Marvel Anime: Wolverine,As long as Morph doesn’t laugh. I’ll be happy
Marvel Anime: Wolverine,#PLEASE KEEP THE ORIGINAL THEME SONG
Marvel Anime: Wolverine,Holy shit I audibly gasped on the bus at this news. This is AWESOME. Changing my ringtone back to the theme song now.
Marvel Anime: Wolverine,The GOAT! They better have the OG theme tune
Marvel Anime: Wolverine,"I rewatched the original a few times and it was really good. Such deep and relevant storytelling from what I saw. Was so into it as a kid. That theme song is epic

I saw a reaaally good jam band Tauk play in DC and all of a sudden they busted out the xmen theme song and killed it. I was ragin."
Marvel Anime: Wolverine,"Please don’t fuck up one of the two best animated comic cartoons, 90’s marvel and Batman the animated series."
Marvel Anime: Wolverine,I'm disappointed that Wolverine isn't being voiced by Chris Pratt.
Marvel Anime: Wolverine,I love that the Disney plus Instagram account posted the Wolverine meme as the announcement photo. So excited for this. Really snagged my childhood heart strings.
Marvel Anime: Wolverine,"Rogue was dummy thicc in the original.

does this throwdown combined with BTAS reboot mean a saturday morning war II???"
Marvel Anime: Wolverine,I’m the juggernaut bitch
Marvel Anime: Wolverine,"The series was horrible at the end, both in animation and story.  Hope they go back to the earlier seasons for continuation rather than the end..."
Marvel Anime: Wolverine,"Not too long ago, on a Sunday morning, I was scrolling Reddit and found that someone had posted the entire pilot episode to this show. I laid in bed, with my phone horizontal and watched the entire thing. Total bliss. Real excited to see this on Disney+"
Marvel Anime: Wolverine,"This series gets a huge amount of credit for having some reasonably mild adaptations of absolutely legendary comic stories. 

This series was part of the reason that Gen X fans (the generation, not the comic team) had lofty expectations of movies largely keeping consistent with the comic arcs. Which they didn't, and probably for the best. 

Time to dust off my Sega Saturn and my X-Men CAPCOM game!"
Marvel Anime: Wolverine,I love this as a kid but it's aged poorly imo. The dialogue alone is pretty bad. I hope it gets modernized a bit even if it picks up where the old story left off.
Marvel Anime: Wolverine,"[spoiler](#s ""It's going to suck"")"
Marvel Anime: Wolverine,Please keep Rogue [juicy.](https://i.imgur.com/sZRI64Y.jpeg)
Marvel Anime: Wolverine,"We'll see when it happens but I don't put trust into Disney for anything they try and make these days. They have been ruining LOTS of stuff for a long time now. Either in sequels, or rebooted etc. 

The old one was great in many ways cause of the fact it clearly had passion behind it and talent. From the cool music, to the actual science facts sprinkled here and there. To entertaining stories, and fun characters. Unfortunately back then they couldn't let Wolverine really use his claws against anything other then robots which when you get older realize how stupid that is (which Logan finally got right, which ill be coming back to this in a bit).

Heck even the Sentinels were actually kinda scary when you first captured glimpses of them and even though the x-men were able to easily beat them. Just imagine having huge tall robots the size of like a 3-4 story house walking after you to try and capture you and could easily crush you with their hands is kinda freaky. 

Every single time they were brought to modern day movies they were so boring and stupid. The one small sliver of hope was at the end of x-men 2? or 3 was it? (or maybe in the beginning) where you see Wolverine get tossed by colossus to what appears to be a sentinel in a post apocalyptic world and have the head fall down on the ground and it looked a lot closer to the cartoon versions only to find out it was just a hologram from the danger room but gave me a bit of hope. 

As for Disney, they have fought tooth and nail to avoid showing any blood or see any humans hurt in movies and tv shows always trying to go the route of robots, or aliens, or some sort of creatures. And the fact that Huge Jackman had to basically take a pay cut and all that crap in order to allow Wolverine to be able to go all out without censorship only for it to be very successful should show you Disney is a crapy company and has been for a while (though not just for that reason, many others). 

We can already see from watching some of the other x-men cartoons that came after how badly some of them did when they could only be aimed at kids really. Some had some good moments but the 90's one was the closest one aimed at teens and was in a decade where it was more acceptable to have slight adult stuff in it. Nowadays everything is all censored or ""can't show that, otherwise we might get sued"" crap. 

I will try to be hopeful but I wont be surprised if it looks okay but once you start watching realize how censored or kiddy it's probably gonna look like. 

Also from so many of Disneys new cartoon shows are so awful. Like I understand 2D animation the old way is very time consuming and expensive but the new cell shaded 3D modeled computer made animation so many of these new Disney cartoons are using just look awful. Doesn't help that the stories and stuff also kinda stink."
Marvel Anime: Wolverine,Very cool. Lat decent one was wolverine and the x men
Marvel Anime: Wolverine,"I will be 34 y/o when this comes out.  
I will watch the absolute FUCK out of it."
Marvel Anime: Wolverine,"I wonder if they'll include characters who weren't in the original show or who were created after the show like Kitty Pryde, most of the New Mutants, X-23, Onslaught, or Bastion."
Marvel Anime: Wolverine,[It had better have the original theme tune or it can just fuck right off.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAkL2-vh2Sk)
Marvel Anime: Wolverine,[Obligatory theme song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAkL2-vh2Sk)
Marvel Anime: Wolverine,"Disney: Yeah, uh huh, well if you're out of ideas just recycle an older show and call it a remaster. Revival? Those idiots will love that"
Marvel Anime: Wolverine,[deleted]
Marvel Anime: Wolverine,"Oh boy, can’t wait to have another nostalgia bait product sold to us. What happened to originality?"
Marvel Anime: Wolverine,Please not in anime style.
Marvel Anime: Wolverine,"Duck Disney, I’ll never give them my money for ruining Marvel and now they are coming after my childhood version? For shame you money hungry butt munches, for shame!"
Marvel Anime: Wolverine,No thanks
Marvel Anime: Wolverine,"I love and hate this at the same time.  

I love that we're getting an X-Men cartoon. I'm interested in what changes to the roster they'll make as a lot of popular characters were either only in an episode or 2 (Nightcrawler, Archangel, Psylocke), or never there (Kate Pride, Doug Ramsey, Magik, any of the New Mutants/X-Force besides Cable).      


I hate that it's going to be in the 90's era.  If some kid watches this and then picks up an X-Men comic from today they'll be totally lost.  I really hope this doesn't make the books pivot back to the previous status quo which had become very stale."
Marvel Anime: Wolverine,"They now have access to all marvel characters, so maybe some decent secret wars and war of the gems arcs?"
Marvel Anime: Wolverine,"Unmodified hopefully?

Or will this be disneys version of the ‘97 X-Men?"
Marvel Anime: Wolverine,And don’t forget the arcade game based on this series! 🔥
Marvel Anime: Wolverine,More things no one asked for
Marvel Anime: Wolverine,I hope they keep the story as is and don’t make a Disney move
Marvel Anime: Wolverine,They keep trying to ruin every single IP.
Marvel Anime: Wolverine,The voice acting will never be as good as the original.
Marvel Anime: Wolverine,Can’t wait to watch this get screwed up.
Marvel Anime: Wolverine,The best thing about the future is. When you run out of ideas you just make the old shit and “remaster” it call it new content
Marvel Anime: Wolverine,"It's cool that they're dedicating to animated shows, especially cool that its xmen. But I think it's a missed opportunity continuing the 90s show. The show is, in my opinion, no where near as good as most people like to remember. And Xmen as a property has grown a lot since the show aired. 

They could've done something fresh like a show based on current Krakoa xmen. I would've been excited to see even a show with a slight twist on the classic xmen setup like Xmen evolution for example.  But nostalgia pays I guess"
Marvel Anime: Wolverine,"With this being made my marvel studios, I guess this show is/has always been part of the mcu multiverse"
Marvel Anime: Wolverine,Ah shit another great thing about to be ruined by Disney
Marvel Anime: Wolverine,"I hope they don't ruin it with 2020 era politics. The original was plenty political but had tact. It's political by nature, but I just hope they don't beat you over the head with it and pull another ""maybe it should be x-women instead of x-men"" *looks at the camera*"
Marvel Anime: Wolverine,It will likely be the modern computer animated cartoon trash not the actual 90s style animation
Marvel Anime: Wolverine,X-men? The dated metaphor for racism in the 60s?
Lip Service,Give me what I want and I will go away.
Lip Service,I felt like it went off the rails a little towards the end but Colm Feore was absolutely incredible.
Lip Service,Is it streaming anywhere?
Lip Service,"Watched this for the first time in over a decade this summer after I went on a Stephen King nostalgia binge. Held up surprisingly well and hit the spot for me, although I wouldn't say it's even close to 'one of the best of' anythings."
Lip Service,"I thought it was complete and utter crap.

The one thing I took away from it was that people back in the day were made out to have a spine that was lacking in the present day and that God just sucks if he lets this sort of thing happen (people being given the 'choice' but they'll all get killed if they actually resist and God stands by and does nothing)."
Lip Service,">I felt like it went off the rails a little towards the end

So basically like the ending to *every* Stephen King novel"
Lip Service,hulu
Lip Service,"Hahaha very much so. 

And on that subject, I wouldn't normally recommend something where I felt the ending faltered significantly, but in this case the premise and atmosphere early on is good enough to justify it. Feore is a terrific villain."
Lip Service,"Yeah, it's still a miniseries worth seeing.

Unlike **Rose Red** which is waaaaaay too long for its premise and completely falls apart at the end."
Lip Service,I really LOVED LOVED the first few episodes (in part because it gave me childhood Oregon trail game flashbacks) but after that the writing went to shit and completely jumped the shark with that girls plotline. I've rarely seen a show descend in quality so quickly. Really disappointing.
Lip Service,"Come on. It's passingly entertaining, but also pretty poorly written, and just absurd at times. 

Like all they do is complain about the immigrant wagon train and never do anything to actually teach or help them. 

The voiceovers by the main character are cringe-inducingly bad. And it was just silly how a family in 1883 is cool with their teen daughter fucking a cowboy she's known for a week, then immediately moving on to another guy. It's just silly."
Lip Service,Can't get past the blonde girl doing stupid shit...and let's not forget she was a cowboy and an Indian in the span of 3 episodes. Everything else about the show was amazing.
Lip Service,It's very well shot. But I found it kind of boring? And I love slow burns.
Lip Service,I wouldn't say it's unreal.  I think it's pretty easy to set out and tell a good limited story.  Most problems arise when you get a second season.
Lip Service,the blonde chick is so hot
Lip Service,Isn't it a prequel?  Do I have to watch something else first?
Lip Service,I was surprised how much I enjoyed it especially because I cannot really articulate why.
Lip Service,"I’m not a fan of Yellowstone so I was skeptical but man how good 1883 is. It’s just this miniseries, we can say an anthological story about the western. The story is just full of many characteristics, a great reconstruction and realization. Cast was awesome and everything written worked, every dialogue and every relationship. Really a good job from beginning to the finale."
Lip Service,"I dont know, man. Im on ep 4 and bored out of my mind and didnt watch further in weeks. I can admit its good writing so far character-wise, but it is still so goddamn boring."
Lip Service,Personally I loved it through and through
Lip Service,I was hoping for 5 seasons of this show.
Lip Service,"Her hyper-mannered narration and the boyfriend-of-the-week storylines were painful, though I saw it through because I knew there was a definite end."
Lip Service,"Have to agree. I was in love with the setting, plot, characters. But it definitely dragged and then just shit the bed at the end. Still good. Just not as good as say the first 3 episodes"
Lip Service,"While I did like a lot of the characters, it seemed like a bait and switch.  Viewers thought they were getting a tale of western ruggedness starring Sam Elliot, Tim McGraw and Lamonica Garrett, but it quickly became a young woman coming of age story with a lot of girl power messaging.   I am sure there is an audience for that, but it would be helpful to let viewers know in advance.  They lost an opportunity to appeal to that demographic while  possibly alienating people who were disappointed.  The latter could have a negative impact on his other prequels.  It wouldn't surprise me if 1923 is not as big of a success as Yellowstone and or Sheridan's other shows."
Lip Service,"I was not a fan of all the complaining about the immigrants. While I understand they were inexperienced and naive, I was hoping for a more in-depth exploration of their motivations and some growth.  They were almost as useless at the end as they were at the beginning."
Lip Service,It's a prequel to Yellowstone. I watched an episode of that but couldn't get into it. I loved 1883 though. It stands on it's on.
Lip Service,"It doesn't require you to know anything, but understanding the story of Yellowstone adds some extra poignancy to the journey, though I suppose it's enough to know that Yellowstone is where these characters' decedents have a family ranch."
Lip Service,"All the stuff with Empire and Gaal to me is ACES. 

All the stuff on Terminus is absolute shit. Like wow. So bad. 

The show has weird balance of good and awful."
Lip Service,"Haven’t read the books, but found the show episode. Have watched up to episode four and hasn’t gained my interest. Would rather watch paint dry."
Lip Service,I'm enjoying it.  the empire stuff is fascinating.  the terminus stuff not so much.
Lip Service,"dunno. i did enjoy many asimov stories, but i did not like the foundation books much. they bored me to the point i had troubles to give a summary of their content.

now i do watch the series, even if it certainly is not among the greatest series ever, it an ok watch  for me.

so yeah, from my perspective they did a stellar job and make something remotely decent from a booring book with interesting setting."
Lip Service,">  I expected well written dialog, good pacing, and an intelligent and original story that satisfied the intellectual curiosity of folks 

I expect that from every drama I watch.

I feel ya OP, the Foundation TV show just sucks."
Lip Service,"It’s bad. Tonight’s episode was the last I’m going to watch. I liked the Empire and Trantor storylines (well, up until Dawn and the gardener) and Gaal’s past, and the first episode was wonderful. However, the Terminus setting and dialogue make this unwatchable. It’s like a bad show on the SYFY channel. I have not read the books, and I find the show lackluster. My husband has read all the books multiple times and was eagerly anticipating the show, so he’s offended by how bad it is. It’s especially hard going back to this show after just watching Dune, which is probably an unfair standard for any series."
Lip Service,"The worst part is it’s just boring. Nothing happens. 

It’s a huge disappointment."
Lip Service,"Yeah not agree. The show is great, interesting and fun."
Lip Service,"As someone who was disappointed with an adaptation as well (the witcher) I can empathize with ur feelings. I have heard the foundation books would be pretty much impossible to adapt properly due to how they are written so you were expecting it to be different. With the Witcher imo the lack of faithfulness is even worse imo because the first two books were comprised of short stories, which basically made it perfect for a tv series, where each episode has to have a beginning, middle, and end. That being said they still cut out a lot and swapped out content in favor of their own original stuff, which I normally don’t mind if it accomplishes what the author intended in the source material, but it doesn’t.

I will say though, at the very least the nice thing is this will expose more people to the books. While most viewers will never touch the books, some will. I think any fan of a book series that has a poor adaptation can at least find some solace in that."
Lip Service,I must be watching a different show because I'm absolutely loving it. Probably my favorite current show.
Lip Service,"When a show is bad, its bad. Nothing can change that, faithful or not."
Lip Service,I like the show.
Lip Service,You got GOYERED!
Lip Service,I couldn’t agree more. This show has been a disappointing mess from the get. I didn’t make it past the second episode.
Lip Service,"That is disappointing to hear. I haven’t gotten to watch yet, but I’ve been itching to. I was wondering how anyone could ever adapt the Foundation series into a TV show myself."
Lip Service,"I disagree,i am loving the show (mainly the Empire storyline)."
Lip Service,"It's such bad science fiction: it doesn't take it's own setting seriously.

How long does it take to get from one star system to another? Nobody who watches the show can answer that because the *show* can't decide how fast we should expect a ship to be. We know that the Empire has access to FTL ""jump ships"" but that they're operated by crews of Spacers. But on Terminus there's a space trader who runs a circuit around a couple of local star systems, probably a 20 light year trip or so.

But he's not a hundred years old, so clearly *his* ship has an FTL drive too. How does he use it without any Spacers to put him to sleep and wake up?

How did they get to Terminus in the first place? Well, the ""slow"" way, for a trip of 50,000 LY, which is still apparently at such astonishing speeds that they complete the trip in three years. What drive is *that* supposed to be? Jumping is the only FTL technology anyone's mentioned - do the writers of the show think you can exceed the speed of light by many many thousands of times on only traditional Newtonian thrust?

It seems like a quibble but this is the stuff that *hard* science fiction is about, and to make a Foundation show and totally ignore Asimov's ""foundational"" role as a hard SF author isn't very satisfying."
Lip Service,"Lol this is so many words to say absolutely nothing.  There is no content to this post other than ""I don't like the Foundation TV show.""


And you don't ""need"" anything, storytelling isn't driven by ""what do we need?"""
Lip Service,"I dont care, it's pretty enough so I can forgive the annoying parts. Still wondering where it goes"
Lip Service,"From what I can see online, Foundation's biggest problem is that it didn't pay fealty to the hardcore fans of the books (the number of which amount to a rounding error in the viewership numbers) and other special interest groups (such as people who find gender swaps too ""woke""), in-turn inspiring them to post/comment almost daily on Reddit and other social media about a show they don't like instead of moving on with their lives.

That said - I personally find the quality of the show to be unreliable, but still enjoy it and am optimistic that season 2 will smooth things out a bit."
Lip Service,I think making it PG-14 ruined the show.
Lip Service,My thinking is this first season is the last.
Lip Service,"I mean, I like the series. I read Foundation but didn't read any follow up books. I knew going in that there wasn't an easy plot for characters to follow."
Lip Service,"I notice that folks that haven't read the books find those that have annoying :) As one that has read the books, here's a quick explanation in case you are curious. The central idea of the books, the whole point of them, is that using math where trillions of people are involved enables you to understand future mega-patterns. This is actually faithfully described in Episode 1. Hari predicted the Empire's collapse and that by creating The Foundation the dark times would be reduced from 30K years to 1,000 years. Their subtle influence over that 1,000 years makes the difference. And, to go along with that, individuals don't make a difference. That's it. Personally, I don't care about any of the other elements of the book. I expected completely new storylines. Some of them have been quite good. But the central ""character"" of psychohistory (what the math stuff is called) has been completely sidelined. It is vaguely referenced from time to time, but what we mainly have in the series is just stories about individuals. So, IMHO, Foundation is a TV series about something or other, but it is Asimov's story in name only. I'm more or less enjoying the series, but disappointed that I don't get to experience the main point of the books."
Lip Service,It rips the heart of Asimov's novels from it.
Lip Service,"Yeah, I actually really love the addition of the clones, and how the Cleons are reacting to problems in the empire, brother day is my favorite, because when he doesn’t get a vision from the spiral it is clear that it changes him towards understanding the need for change, even though this realization comes too late"
Lip Service,"I'd say read the books 

the last ones are a bit annoying mind you(the pacing , repetitive travels etc) but otherwise these books are so good and have so many things to analyse (psychology, philosophy)"
Lip Service,">It’s like a bad show on the SYFY channel.

All 3 seasons of [Dark Matter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TqwBlTQfTg) cost less than the pilot of Foundation and yet it ran circles around it it terms of writing, pacing and characterization."
Lip Service,The empire and the gardener storyline has a good payoff that shows how many cracks there are really in the foundation of the empire
Lip Service,"Yes, it has some serious pacing issues."
Lip Service,"I'm one of those people that is enjoying the show and is seriously considering reading the books once this season is over.  I don't know how many more there are like me, but book readers can take that for a win ... though I can't imagine I'll be joining the ones that hate the show since it's my first exposure to Foundation."
Lip Service,"> I will say though, at the very least the nice thing is this will expose more people to the books.

Huh? The garbage show will turn more people off from the books."
Lip Service,Really enjoyed the start but starting to get a *bit* worried.  Now we're taking off on some ship from Terminus and I'm wondering where the Hell any of it is going.
Lip Service,"Haven’t read the books. Love the show. That said, it’s not unusual for devoted readers of the source material to dislike the resulting shows. See Game of Thrones and the insufferable commentary that went on for years about the show vs. the books."
Lip Service,it’s one of the best shows ever. i’m blown away by every episode and can’t wait until the next one.
Lip Service,"Its not an adaptation of the source material, which is fine, its ""very very loosely inspired by it"". Very loosely. They basically used a loose version of the Foundation universe and the actual Foundation and made a different show that happens to contain these elements... and do it, poorly.

The problem is just that its really bad. Really bad. Bad acting (except Lee Pace, he gets a huge pass, he's on point), bad show, bad pacing, stupid plot. Terrible editing and format. Its not fun."
Lip Service,"I was disappointed to. I don't think anyone could faithfully adapt the books to TV. But I think great shows could be created based on the premises of the books. 

Unfortunately it requires talented storytellers for that, which the current shows does not have."
Lip Service,Watch for yourself instead of listening to some rando on reddit
Lip Service,it’s a great show. don’t listen to these complainers. For every jackass complaining about it on reddit there are a hundred of us who love it but aren’t posting about it. It’s one of the most amazing shows ever made for tv.
Lip Service,">It's such bad science fiction: it doesn't take it's own setting seriously.

Because it does not take its audience seriously. But based on most of the comments I see here,  fundamentally they are not wrong."
Lip Service,"Both methods of travel have to be FTL, maybe everyone else uses warp speed and Empire has transwarp technology, which would make sense that they hold it for themselves exclusively, being faster than your enemy would be quite advantageous."
Lip Service,"There's several FTL technologies,  the fastest is the jump drive a type of space folding, which the empire has a monopoly on.  How Asimov described it:   


""The Jump remained, and would probably remain for ever, the only practical method of traveling between the stars. Travel through ordinary space could proceed at no rate more rapid than that of ordinary light (a bit of scientific knowledge that belonged among the few items known since the forgotten dawn of human history), and that would have meant years of travel between the nearest of inhabited systems. Through hyper-space, that unimaginable region that was neither space nor time, matter nor energy, something nor nothing, one could traverse the length of the Galaxy in the intervals between two neighboring instants of time.""  


the character R. Daneel Olivaw. (Demerzel)  explains in the show human minds are incapable of witnessing it, and was surprised (in one of his alias' Chetter Hummin ""human"" get it? that Gaal shouldn't have been able to see it.  
the ""slow ships"" use some sort of hyperspace, or perhaps warp which would be about warp factor between 9 and 10, using StarTrek's convention, and the traders and rescue pods seem to prefer some sort of other FTL that takes decades instead of years to travel, requiring cryosleep chambers.   


it does't strike me as inconsistent. ""FTL moves as fast as the plot requires"". In today's world we have 1800s train technology running in parallel to bullet trains as well as light rails, and freight, we have both cars and jets."
Lip Service,"I have no issue whatsover with the gender swap and as I mentioned previously, I expected the show to deviate greatly from the book.

My issue is really with how poorly written, poorly paced and derivative the show is. The segments focused on the cloned emperors are interesting, have novel ideas and the clichés are kept to a minimum. But the sections on Terminus are just unbearable. The entire Terminus plot is a huge dumpster fire, with terrible acting and choreography and a story that simply does not make sense."
Lip Service,"Dude, it’s just bad. Why is everyone in the future wearing rejected costumes from Game of Thrones? Why are the Anacreons basically Dothraki nomadic herders who still fight with bows and arrows, or retro muskets, yet have access to motherfucking spaceships?

It’s just…so small on scale and in imagination, and what they do try to do is so mixed up and confused that I have a hard time believing the show runners have any clear concept for the show other than extend the soap opera drama"
Lip Service,"The problem with gender swaps is the same thing you see with 90% of all race swaps: they aren't really 'swapping', you're just wholesale replacing one group with members of the other.

The Boys is the epitome of this. Every swap is male to female. They are, remarkably enough, not like that on race. You have white actors playing black characters from the book, and black characters playing character that are white in the book. But it's still like that with male characters..

And it's not true to life. We see in professions involving danger that women simply flat-out do not participate at anything approaching the level that men do. There are female fire fighters. There are female cops. They are both by far outnumbered by men, and female applicants for these jobs are far outnumbered by men.

So you have a case where things are not being applied with any level of equality, and in which reality is not something any of you can appeal to when trying to indicate why you want this to happen. You just want it to happen for no discernable reason other than a bug up the ass."
Lip Service,"I agree that they're treating psychohistory as ""and then magic happens"". It's the aspect i like the least. One of the plot tensions i'm looking for is how individuality comes crashing into the predictions. I'm most excited about the Portrayal of the Mule, I'm very interested in the genetic aberrant Emperor, and why Gaal is unique.   


one of Asimov's favorite tropes was to make unbreakable rules and then write interesting stories about how they're ridiculous. This is reflected in Daniel Olivaw's character in the show Eto Demerzel saying that he's ""loyal to Empire"" and insisting on the title convention for the Emperor to be ""Empire"" to allow himself to lie to Cleo about his betrayal of the three laws and his devotion to the zeroth.   


I'm really hoping the series digs more into this plot."
Lip Service,"It is slow I’ll agree even though I like the show, it very much grinds through. The terminus story line is so brain dead and never gets better. This is so weird since I think the rest of the show, especially brother day’s story is really good"
Lip Service,"I feel the show attempts to grasp as Asimov's expansive vision.   


Like all of that is super hard to transfer from books to movies. I for one intend to continue watching, just because I love good sci fi, and producers need to be told there's an appetite. ences decades later,  of visions and religions that spanned centuries. Hitchiker's borrowed Encyclopedia Galactica.   


Like all of that is super hard to transfer from books to movies. I for one intend to continue watching, just becuase I love sci fi, and producers need to be told there's an appetite.   


I intend to re-read the Robot, Empire, and Foundation series, and i hope i can introduce friends to it."
Lip Service,"There’s a pretty good chance (depending on the property) that those same people who were turned off from reading because of the show would’ve never read the books in the first place. Even the Witcher, which had a pretty big following because of the games and books still has many people coming to the Witcher subs asking on where to start since they had never heard of the Witcher or touched Witcher media until they were exposed to the show.

Similarly, there are probably people who had never heard of The Foundation books and now it exists. If they like the show, a relatively small but significant number of people will pick up the books. If they didn’t like it sure many of them may not read it, but some will. At the very least the ones who don’t are aware of the books and maybe some day will pick them up. I mean I hadn’t heard of The Foundation up until the show announcement. I haven’t even watched the show and I wanted to read the books already. I figure if it got an adaptation then it must be doing something good."
Lip Service,"well TBF  George Martin took so long to write, they had to go their own path /s"
Lip Service,You're supposed to add /s so people get your point
Lip Service,Still better than your comment tho lol.
Lip Service,I’m still going to give it a chance for sure. You are setting the bar way too high though.
Lip Service,">	Because it does not take its audience seriously. 

Which I think is a bad miss for an Apple TV+ show, usually they're better about that (""Invasion"" is pretty bad too, though.)"
Lip Service,">	Both methods of travel have to be FTL

Sure, they have to be, but do the writers know that? There seems to be some kind of ""implied drive"" that the show never talks about but which can accelerate a spacecraft to many times C."
Lip Service,"The part of the show I enjoy the most is also the emperor stuff, which wasn't in the book at all, and a really interesting concept

Everything set on Terminus is just awful. I don't care about any of the gender swaps either (the books are the product of an era where female characters were either housewives or bland sex objects, so not introducing women with agency would have been really odd in 2021), but it's just.. not good. I think in an entire season they barely reached what took the book a hundred pages, it's worse paced than the Hobbit."
Lip Service,"That’s cool. I posted that 304d ago, since then I found a couple of the books at the bookstore of a public library I visit on occasion.   I haven’t read them, but I started buying a few other books… and it’s gotten me interested in reading for the first time in decades."
Lip Service,"yeah no..

If the Foundation show was great and built a good fanbase the number of readers of the books would have grown tremendously."
Lip Service,I’m totally serious. My wife and i are loving it. I’ve never seen such an epic television production. I have no idea why people keep complaining about it.
Lip Service,"But still tanking with mainstream Audiences just like that other Apple's dogshit show INVASION, but go off."
Lip Service,i can’t think of a television production that comes close
Lip Service,"If the shows are driving increase subscriptions, it fulfils its mission. Since most viewers don't seem to care about the inconsistencies and the quality of the show, why should Apple?"
Lip Service,"I was totally excited to see the attempt being made. I hope it gets approved for at least 5 series. I'm excited to see the origin of the Mule, and how they adapt that plot"
Lip Service,Season 2 of this dumpster fire of a show got greenlit somehow.
Lip Service,"Haha what

The wire? Sopranos? The first 4 seasons of GoT? Breaking bad"
Lip Service,I guess Apple got money to waste for more fan boycott of this horse shit. Good for them I guess.
Lip Service,"I’m talking about the quality of the production itself. The set design, the customes, the effects. The Wore is top quality writing, but the production is nothing special. (It doesn’t need to be)"
Lip Service,"I'm watching it now, episode 3...I'm enjoying it. Well acted, shot and beautiful clothes/set...I hope the story keeps up. The use of 60s rock is interesting...not sure how I feel about it yet..."
Lip Service,Also watching it and enjoying it but I love all of the Spanish historical dramas from Bambu.
Lip Service,Its just like hunters on prime
Lip Service,Did you spot the glaring error at 7:25 into episode 2. A Quartz watch... in the ealry 1960's! LOL. Seiko produced first in Dec 1969. Also her scar alternates from right to left side of her forehead. So film mirrored sometimes perhaps. Terrible continuity.
Lip Service,"This show is the biggest piece of garbage. I've already watched three episodes so i might as well finish it. First off, the music is trash, whenever the team is on a mission they play some 70's porno music. The gun/firearm scenes are an embarrassment. Isabel is holding a Luger P08 it has an 8 round magazine plus 1 in the chamber if its topped off. When she jumps over the first car in the first episode she fires 12 rounds.

Also when a guns cocked its cocked. Every other time the slide is manipulated or the charging handle on a rifle is pulled, a bullet will eject from the chamber. She kept racking the slide on the Luger and no rounds were ejecting. Every time she was about to see action she would rack it. Nobody does that.

the show takes place in 1962 but i think it's the third episode the young kid is listening to Rolling Stones Paint it Black which was recorded in 1966.

The shootout in the Club where all the Nazi's and supporters hang out was pathetic. They're no further than 10 metres apart and they all completely miss their targets . The one guy firing the MP-38/40 with the converted barrel with heat shield had the infinity ammo cheat code. that weapon fires 500 rounds minute, a 32 round magazine is gone in a few seconds. This guy had continued fire for 10 plus seconds. Plus he missed Isabel and Lucena and they were so close.

The attack on Him where they think he's in the car, they attack the car with pistols, and after better yet, they attack the yacht with handguns. earlier they had sten sub-machine guns in the trunk of the mercedes but now they're commencing an assault with sidearms. The dudes on the boat are firing back at Lucena and Isabel with MP-40's and they're within arms reach and nobody gets shot, but Lucena did manage to shoot a guy on the yacht with his shitty pistol. After they rammed the boat and it exploded, there's no way in hell after that expulsion they all would've survived and swam back to shore. Also how did they miss Bachmann and Heim. This show is so full of holes. It's just terrible. Plus why the fuck are they always wearing coats, they're in spain with Palm trees like in Almeria. There' so much more shit i could add but this is off the top of my head."
Lip Service,"yeah it basically,spanish versions of the hunters"
Mr. Bean: The Whole Bean,"Oh my God, this is perfect. I need it"
Mr. Bean: The Whole Bean,This is great. Mr Bean never fails to make me laugh. 
Mr. Bean: The Whole Bean,I used to show my Korean students Mr. Bean videos and they LOVED it! 
Mr. Bean: The Whole Bean,"I have the series on DVD, and it's pretty bad quality. I still watch it occasionally. "
Mr. Bean: The Whole Bean,I thought it was hilarious!
Mr. Bean: The Whole Bean,Then you should get this new set that is out tomorrow! Improved audio and video.
Mr. Bean: The Whole Bean,"Mr. Bean has and will always be very dear to me. Growing up, my grandparents used to always play taped episodes for my sister and I and we would all watch it together. There was a pretty big language barrier between us, and this show was a great way to bond over jokes that really didn't require any dialogue whatsoever."
Mr. Bean: The Whole Bean,Watch the Christmas ep every year. Excellent comedy
Mr. Bean: The Whole Bean,Look up Rowan Atkinson - Invisible Drum on youtube. You will not be disappointed.
Mr. Bean: The Whole Bean,Dude…: if you like Mr. Bean… check out Man vs. Bee by Rowan Atkinson. Nine 10 minute episodes. Sooooo funny.
Mr. Bean: The Whole Bean,"First episode is still my favorite. He shows no stupid behavior at all, only childish. Taking a Trigonometry test is not for idiots."
Mr. Bean: The Whole Bean,Mr bean is great but I’ll always know him for the narcoleptic in rat race. Every actor in that movie is seriously fucking hilarious.
Mr. Bean: The Whole Bean,He was also the best part of the Olympics opeing ceremony.
Mr. Bean: The Whole Bean,"My favourite thing about Bean now is the 90s vibe + cinematography.

There's something really romantic about it and its simplicity. I grew up in the 90s though never in the UK so it has an added charm and it ended up making me try to capture that same mood on other stuff on Britbox (the British sadly did not do as well with 90s sitcoms as the US). The comedies now are very glossy and schizoid whereas something like Bean or Alan Partridge feels quite calming because of how and where it was filmed even when the actual content is chaotic."
Mr. Bean: The Whole Bean,It's one of the funniest tv shows that constantly make me laugh out loud.
Mr. Bean: The Whole Bean,"the one where he's late to the dentist and blitzes off, feet on the wheel, still makes me roll like a child. Rowan is a national legend"
Mr. Bean: The Whole Bean,Check out Blackadder too (don't start with series 1 though).
Mr. Bean: The Whole Bean,"If you enjoy Rowan, I would recommend some other works he's done, like Blackadder and The Thin Blue Line."
Mr. Bean: The Whole Bean,Thanks for the recommend! I've been wanting some good comedy.
Mr. Bean: The Whole Bean,Well regarded Shakespearian actor too.
Mr. Bean: The Whole Bean,Check out Rowan Atkinson Live. It's hilarious!
Mr. Bean: The Whole Bean,Welcome to early 90s comedy.
Mr. Bean: The Whole Bean,Look up the time he was the doctor
Mr. Bean: The Whole Bean,"\^ This. THE.BEST.EVER.

His poor girlfriend lol. That's all I'm going to say."
Mr. Bean: The Whole Bean,"Him playing with the manager set just cracks me up.


His new show Man Vs Bee definitely has Mr. Bean vibes. Very funny"
Mr. Bean: The Whole Bean,"> [Rowan Atkinson - Invisible Drum](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_kloG2Z7tU)

The timing required for that skit is astounding."
Mr. Bean: The Whole Bean,I agree. It was on Netflix in Canada. Hilarious.
Mr. Bean: The Whole Bean,It's a race! I hope I win.
Mr. Bean: The Whole Bean,"Father Ted, My Family, Spaced, Alan Partridge, One Foot in the Grave, Keeping Up Appearances, 2.4 Children, Bottom, Men Behaving Badly, Royale Family, As Time Goes By, Goodnight Sweetheart, and that’s just the ones that started in the 90s."
Mr. Bean: The Whole Bean,"Oh yeah, I never really cared about Bean, but Blackadder (s2 forward) was brilliant. The part of Bean and Blackadder being so different and him doing them so effortlessly just adds to his greatnesss. It's like Hugh Laurie going from his early comedic work to House."
Mr. Bean: The Whole Bean,Thank you - I don't know how to link content.
Mr. Bean: The Whole Bean,"Always like to share this because I found it funny first time I heard about it;

The opening sequence of Mr Bean has him dropping out the sky with the heavenly choir singing in Latin.

The lyrics are “Ecce homo qui est faba” which means “behold the man who is a bean” lol"
Mr. Bean: The Whole Bean,Tbf he was a pretty selfish raging asshole when you think about it. It was just that he was too stupid to hate.
Mr. Bean: The Whole Bean,"Huh. I never thought of it that way, but that’s pretty accurate."
Mr. Bean: The Whole Bean,If Bean was a narcissist what would you call Blackadder
Mr. Bean: The Whole Bean,Mr Bean was from an entirely different planet.
Mr. Bean: The Whole Bean,"Does this one talk? I don’t think that man could go much longer without talking haha. His voice is really soothing, too"
Mr. Bean: The Whole Bean,I have been waiting for this forever. Geez
Mr. Bean: The Whole Bean,"We dont need a new Mr Bean, we need a new Blackadder, by far his greatest work."
Mr. Bean: The Whole Bean,It is worth remembering that there is an episode where Bean makes fun of a woman covered in bandages and casts. And then he takes advantage of her being paralyzed in order to get further ahead in the hospital queue. Which makes his punishment at the end of the episode even better.
Mr. Bean: The Whole Bean,">“I rarely laugh, physically, out loud at anything. I can just see when it works.”

This doesn't surprise me at all.

He seems like a man that takes being silly very seriously."
Mr. Bean: The Whole Bean,New Rowan Atkinson show? Here for it.
Mr. Bean: The Whole Bean,MBMBAM get ready for 2 episodes about this article.

Mr. Bean: The Whole Bean,hell yeah Mr.Bean rules
Mr. Bean: The Whole Bean,"I never read him as that way. He was in his own world but it was never portrayed as cruel or inconsiderate. Some people are just charmingly oblivious, and such was Mr. Bean."
Mr. Bean: The Whole Bean,"He didn’t get a shower in his hotel room, so he cut out a hole in the neighbouring shower room and used that instead. How is that anything but anarchistic?"

Mr. Bean: The Whole Bean,"I can see it, but I really thought for years Bean was just a literal Alien being. He did everything in a subversive, unordinary fashion, which felt more like an aliens misunderstanding or misguided interpretation of how things were meant to be. And the fact in the intro credits he literally drops out the sky in the centre of tractor beam like spot light...so y'know more evidence to child me.

This explanation makes WAY more sense as an adult though. It explains how he actually just does things that he wants in his own way and in his own time. Completely ignorant or uncaring to how his actions affected the rest of the world he was subjecting them to. This isn't to say the character is ""ruined"" or ""tainted"", but now I have a more complete understanding of the character, and it's making me see him in a different light.

If anything, this makes me want to watch Bean again with this in mind."
Mr. Bean: The Whole Bean,"I don’t care who Mr. Bean was. Besides, I can’t walk. They tied my shoelaces together."
Mr. Bean: The Whole Bean,"Just a reminder that Rowan Atkinson is an incredibly, incredibly talented actor who can pretty much knock it out of the park everything from crime dramas to comedies. Definitely Check out the ITV show Maigret to see his amazing acting in a much more somber role."

Mr. Bean: The Whole Bean,"It’s very clear to anyone who paid attention. Mr Bean was a complete asshole, who often went out of his way to inconvenience people he chose at random. He was the villain of his world no question."
Mr. Bean: The Whole Bean,I remember finding Mr Bean hard to watch when I was younger. I always considered it a kind of show that chronicles the adventures of someone mentally challenged and makes a laugh of it.

Mr. Bean: The Whole Bean,A real human bean
Mr. Bean: The Whole Bean,"Aso in the cartoon series he was actually dropped by a spaceship of other Mr. Beans, all having different stuffed animals, not Teddies. So at least in the cartoon, Mr. Bean is an alien species."

Mr. Bean: The Whole Bean,"I hated him as a character, while still appreciating Atkinson’s brilliance. My dad loved Mr. Bean, but I knew way too many men just like him in the evangelical churches I was raised in. It’s disconcerting how well he plays the perfect petulant man-child without any words."
Mr. Bean: The Whole Bean,I don't think most people watched rooting for Mr. Bean. They were there to see him get his in hilarious fashion.
Mr. Bean: The Whole Bean,"I mean he would always have a fuss when he never got his way, then gloat about minute wins, often to young children"
Marvel Anime: X-Men,I'm tired of these spoiler titles. Let me watch the episode ffs. It hasn't even been 24hrs
Marvel Anime: X-Men,Pretty sure it was dr strange literally showing professor X in another timeline but ok
Marvel Anime: X-Men,"It was awesome. Plus they played the 90s animated X-men theme under it. Sign. me. up. 

Now after Marvels movie give me Jared Keeso as Wolverine in a mid-credit scene please."
Marvel Anime: X-Men,Will MCU be able to pull off the politics of the Xmen?
Marvel Anime: X-Men,[deleted]
Marvel Anime: X-Men,This is the most PR I’ve seen for a single show in a long time.
Marvel Anime: X-Men,Why's everything gotta be a build up for something
Marvel Anime: X-Men,There is no longer even the concept of a surprise within Marvel anymore
Marvel Anime: X-Men,"The original X-men movies were great popcorn movies imo, the first couple of the reboot were great but the problem with comics if you stick with them is the space shit just... gets really weird, it wasn't really written well in comic form and space movies in general are hard to kinda write  


it's kind of why i'm not really looking forward with the whole space part of the MCU that they're going in now  


If they did a like.. modern day X-men it might be fine tho, but I'm not really sure how they'd pull it off, I'm not sure how you can do better than hugh jackman, guess they could just.. avoid that character or something  


as others have said though x-men is honestly really political and there's pretty heavy derogatory tones so it'd be hard to do like.. fully seriously, and it's pretty hard to imagine most of the main x-men cast being silly and goofy and telling jokes  


actually yeah i don't think they would do a proper x-men series very good with their formula lol"
Marvel Anime: X-Men,"Part of me really doesn't want to see the X-Men in the MCU. I'd be open to have individual mutants introduced, but not the organization as a whole."
Marvel Anime: X-Men,"As much as I disliked many of the Fox versions, I have little to no confidence in MCU successfully integrating them.

I think they will have better success with Fantastic Four"
Marvel Anime: X-Men,"I'm not getting hyped anymore off of anything introduced in the shows. Haven't seen any evidence stuff carries over. And this would be the second time they tried to get people excited by using a bit of the animated x-men show theme song. It'd also be the third time they dangled a mutant at us like ""ehhh?  Ehhh?  Mutant ehhhh?  Just kidding"" 

At least this was the first end credits that featured someone from the previous films and wasn't just ""hey we got Harry Styles!"" Or ""hey we got Charlize Theron!"" Or ""hey we got Kit Harington as an upcoming MCU superhero!""  The end credit stunt casting announcements are the worst."
Marvel Anime: X-Men,Marvel isn't worth watching anymore.  Put more 'effort into hyping up the next show' is the only theme since Wandavision..very tiresome.
Marvel Anime: X-Men,A marvel show did a thing! Let's write 1000 words on it so we can get that sweaty ad revenue.
Marvel Anime: X-Men,"Oh please, didn’t we already do the X-Men? Can’t we just take a break?"
Marvel Anime: X-Men,"Well, duh. And we’re here for it!! Omg I’ve been waiting so fkng long for MCU X-men. So. Long."
Marvel Anime: X-Men,[removed]
Marvel Anime: X-Men,"And in probably the worst way possible:

* undermine the comic books ( she wasn't a mutant)
* erasing the show (where it showed the origin of her power and it wasn't because she was a mutant)
* making genetic science a joke ( a school kid sequencing the DNA and finding a mutation )
* no tie-in with the show's story. It makes it look like an out-of-the-blue ad, which it is. 
* all this in a show clearly targeted to a niche of the MCU (high school  drama) which few will watch"
Marvel Anime: X-Men,kinda ridiculous that a kid in highschool found out the x gene in her dna.  what highschooler would know that much about genes and have the equipment to do that?
Marvel Anime: X-Men,I don’t want ms marvel to be our guide to xmen world tho…
Marvel Anime: X-Men,"Shitty show and character. That’s the only reason they were forced to say “mutation”, as a last ditch to try to save the show. What was the point of the bracelet if she’s a mutant? Makes no sense."
Marvel Anime: X-Men,"They are really gonna ruin the x-men aren’t they. 
Can’t wait to see professor x on tik tok with thor"
Marvel Anime: X-Men,"Aww man this is gonna suck. No Hugh Jackman, and a bunch of teens doing political stuff
Yuck"
Marvel Anime: X-Men,"Underwhelming, just like the Ms Marvel series."
Marvel Anime: X-Men,They are milking the fuck out of this mutant thing. But when you think about it can you think of a single other aspect  of the marvel universe ur actually looking forward to? Spider verse two but I watched that movie enough times to to realize that whole movie is just a long series of bits. Great though but I don't think I wanna see the second story told in that format again
Marvel Anime: X-Men,"Hmm, would have thought it was Xavier myself."
Marvel Anime: X-Men,Latest breadcrumb? What were the previous ones? Sure there's Professor X but that's not in Earth Prime.
Marvel Anime: X-Men,First significant introduction in this franchise was >!Professor X from the Earth-838 Illuminati in Multiverse of Madness. Ms. Marvel is the second!<
Marvel Anime: X-Men,Plus with namor in black panther wakanda forever and namor in the comics is the first mutants
Marvel Anime: X-Men,"I'm mostly curious why they seem to have changed her from a inhuman to a mutant, but inhumans also have mutations in their DNA so maybe people are just seeing what they wanna see in this..."
Marvel Anime: X-Men,They did the same with that guest appearance in Hawkeye too. Within hours of the episode release.
Marvel Anime: X-Men,"But it has been 24 hrs.

As of your comment its been 40 hrs."
Marvel Anime: X-Men,Spoilers instantly upon looking up anything Marvel these days. It really sucks that it gets people clicks
Marvel Anime: X-Men,Sucks so much :( makes me just want to not watch at all since I don’t have time to keep up to date on everything
Marvel Anime: X-Men,I mean I hate spoilers but I’m confused as to what this headline is spoiling..
Marvel Anime: X-Men,OP’s gotta get their fake internet points though.
Marvel Anime: X-Men,"I guess it's because they confirmed Kamala as the first mutant in the main MCU universe (as in first we're introduced to, not first that exists).

So it's outright introducing mutants (and using the term ""mutated/mutant"" which I think is the first time they've done so) to the main story, which I guess is what makes it significant.

I guess people could've thought that Xavier was just a fun cameo - that'd be dumb since obviously they were gong to introduce mutants eventually - so this confirmation that they've finally arrived is cool."
Marvel Anime: X-Men,"no no, they dropped a *subtle* ""le nod"" in this show!"
Marvel Anime: X-Men,"Yeah but that came out months ago, consume new product now"
Marvel Anime: X-Men,Well no because this episode of Ms. Marvel has come out since then
Marvel Anime: X-Men,Not Ralph Bohner in wandavision?
Marvel Anime: X-Men,"I want to complain that they did the same trick in Doctor Strange 2 when Professor X came out… 

but I can’t because they could play that riff a hundred more times when they allude to mutants and I wouldn’t get sick of it. It’s such a great theme."
Marvel Anime: X-Men,Holy shit please give me Keeso wolverine!
Marvel Anime: X-Men,"That'd be a really fun casting choice but I don't see a creative independent type like Keeso wanting to be locked down by a multi-picture deal that would inevitably come before Letterkenny and now Shoresy. 

Whoever gets cast as Wolverine is going to be the new face of Marvel and will be run into the ground as long as Hugh Jackman, if not longer."
Marvel Anime: X-Men,There's dozens of us! I've been preaching Jared as Wolverine since Disney got the rights.
Marvel Anime: X-Men,"Keeso? Give your balls a tug, ya titfucker!"
Marvel Anime: X-Men,"Christ, it's not exactly like they're going to be quoting Sankara. A generic 'bigotry bad' message is perfectly manageable for Hollywood nowadays."
Marvel Anime: X-Men,"Able? Probably, ""We don't like bigotry"" is an easy stance to take. Whether or not they're willing is another story.

Edit: wow, y'all really let me get away with using ""their"" instead of ""they're."" What happened to you, internet?"
Marvel Anime: X-Men,"It'll be one 30 second scene about Cyclops talking about social intolerance and values of x men, before it gets cut off by rogue joking like

 can I wear sick leather pants?

 Yeh. 

Spandex? 

Yep, whatever makes you feel comfortable. 

 Just enough values so that they can put it into the trailer."
Marvel Anime: X-Men,"In the most tepid way possible, probably."
Marvel Anime: X-Men,Their politics have been horrendous so no
Marvel Anime: X-Men,Definitely not.
Marvel Anime: X-Men,"Nobody complained about Captain America’s politics, so why would they complain about the X-Men?"
Marvel Anime: X-Men,"they play the 90s Xmen theme song right after Bruno says the line. Most people were happy with the line, but putting the riff in there made it more obvious"
Marvel Anime: X-Men,The dude literally says “mutations” as an xmen theme song plays lol
Marvel Anime: X-Men,"Now I get the scene. I didn't understand why he would tell her about some ""mutation"" when she was already a ~~quarter~~ 1/8 alien anyway."
Marvel Anime: X-Men,"I didn't notice the theme song but I did know that they've not been allowed to use any reference to the term ""mutant"" in the franchise previously. Which is why they called Wanda and Pietro ""miracles""

So hearing a character tell Kamala she had a mutation was significant. If you follow that stuff way too much like I do anyways."
Marvel Anime: X-Men,"Every Disney show has gotten the same push though. This has simply not been that interesting for audience otherwise, so it may seem like more because of that."
Marvel Anime: X-Men,The MCU is the world's largest budget TV show
Marvel Anime: X-Men,Every marvel film and tv show are trailer for the next one
Marvel Anime: X-Men,Because otherwise marvel is just aimless cgi sequences.
Marvel Anime: X-Men,Because that’s their whole model? Moon Knight was stand-alone and it was overall pretty meh.
Marvel Anime: X-Men,"So that you buy the next comic, I mean, watch the next show or movie."
Marvel Anime: X-Men,What do you mean about space stuff?
Marvel Anime: X-Men,Hard disagree. The X-Men and Fantastic Four deserve to be in the MCU over the Avengers. It would be like the Justice League not being in the DCEU
Marvel Anime: X-Men,"I *kind* of agree because I have doubts they can fold in mutants into the MCU accurately and without making the movies all about mutants going forward.

But I'm also willing to give them (Fiege) the benefit of the doubt."
Marvel Anime: X-Men,The Fantastic Four has failed twice because the writers don't seem to understand the basic fact at the heart of the team: They're a family. They're not just a team by choice or by necessity. They're a family.
Marvel Anime: X-Men,X-Men may be one of the few things that will make me interested in the MCU again.
Marvel Anime: X-Men,"Trick question, the actual answer is Arcane."
Marvel Anime: X-Men,"> all this in a show clearly targeted to a niche of the MCU 

Why does this bother people? With the assembly line-like way they produce these things and the wide-open possibilities a setting like the MCU provides, why do people get bent out of shape when one out of a dozen of these things tries something different and is targeted at a niche group?"
Marvel Anime: X-Men,Her friend. Forgot his name.
Marvel Anime: X-Men,"I kinda felt the same but it's part of the territory. 

Is it any less silly than Stark building a reactor in a cave from scrap, or Wakanda living in the year 4018 while isolating and not trading with the outside world because they have a magic science metal, or a six palmed sized Macguffins that control fundamental aspects of reality?"
Marvel Anime: X-Men,Can't really ruin it more than Fox already did
Marvel Anime: X-Men,Instead of a bunch of 30 year olds doing political stuff lol
Marvel Anime: X-Men,X-men is literally all politics.
Marvel Anime: X-Men,You think the first actual mention of mutants in the MCU is milking it?
Marvel Anime: X-Men,"The title says ""Latest Breadcrumb"". Not that it's the first."
Marvel Anime: X-Men,I really feel mutants and superheros don't work. Hard to be prejudice against the mutant Spidero but love Spider-man because Spidero got his powers from birth and Spider-man got them from a spider.
Marvel Anime: X-Men,They didn’t confirm it. They just needed to say the word “mutation” in a poor attempt to save the shitty show/character.
Marvel Anime: X-Men,Technically Quicksilver and Wanda were the first Mutants in the MCU as the children of Magneto.
Marvel Anime: X-Men,How can she be the first? What happened to Wolverine? Wasn't he a mutant back in the civil war days?
Marvel Anime: X-Men,"Love when there's a subtle nod

Love when things are confirmed

Love when things are made canon

Love when things are revealed

Love when something is built towards

Love when things are established

Love when things are included

Love when never before seen things are seen for the first time

Love when things are teased

Love when things are referenced

Love when things are explained

Love when things cross over

Love when its only the beginning

Love when ten things I didn't notice get pointed out

Love when there's a scene after the credits"
Marvel Anime: X-Men,"That wasn't Quicksilver, or at least in universe it hasn't been confirmed to be actually Quicksilver, just a look alike. 

In Dr Strange it actually fully is Charles Xavier."
Marvel Anime: X-Men,[We're getting closer and closer to this becoming a reality](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IaGh6g7Keo).
Marvel Anime: X-Men,"I'd say they did a similar trick (without the music) in Wandavision by having the actor who played Quicksilver in the X-Men films show up as Wanda's ""brother"" in the MCU. Sure in hindsight we know it was never meant to be a mutant. But that was stunt casting to troll the fans waiting for mutants to appear. 

Until I see Wolverine's claws pop out in an MCU film I'm not falling for it again lol"
Marvel Anime: X-Men,"Yeah, Feige seems to operate under a mantra of “if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it” when it comes to previous marvel stuff, like with the classic spider-man theme in Homecoming."
Marvel Anime: X-Men,"you're 10-ply, bub."
Marvel Anime: X-Men,"Probably a lot more than dozens. Jared was Nando v Movies pick for Logan, and I'm down for it, because it'll probably lead more people to watch Shoresy."
Marvel Anime: X-Men,FUCK YOU Shorsey!
Marvel Anime: X-Men,But won’t that alienate like half the US population?
Marvel Anime: X-Men,">A generic 'bigotry bad' message is perfectly manageable for Hollywood nowadays.

Guessing you haven't seen Falcon and Winter Soldier"
Marvel Anime: X-Men,"Sure, but I'd argue it's still a bigger message than any of the other MCU movies have."
Marvel Anime: X-Men,"The X-Men have gotten a bit more nuanced than that.  In the comics, they’re an outright superpower now with politics and diplomacy - other nations have to play ball with the mutants as an unified entity.

Heck!  They already brought in a more pragmatic, not necessarily nice Xavier in MoM.  He opted to kill his Strange and judge the 616 Strange in the Illuminati chambers."
Marvel Anime: X-Men,"I really hope it goes beyond that.

Because something that I have never seen any superhero property except The Boys tackle is that while outright bigotry is wrong, being wary against people that can kill you and everyone around you with a sneeze is completely justifiable.

I've always felt making the X-Men 1:1 analogous with gay people was flawed."
Marvel Anime: X-Men,They also mention the song in the credits.  Iman herself confirmed it in her AMA on the marvel studios subreddit.
Marvel Anime: X-Men,"Wait really? I missed that.

Just rewatched. They fucking do!"
Marvel Anime: X-Men,Haven't seen the show. What was the line?
Marvel Anime: X-Men,They needed to add something like Wolverine twerking in the background to make it more obvious.
Marvel Anime: X-Men,"He says that he already analyzed the rest of her families DNA, and that hers was especially different compared to theirs."
Marvel Anime: X-Men,"It's the main reason why I lost interest in capeshit IMO. Nothing is ever good enough to stand on its own. Everything must be an event, a crossover, the thing before the next big thing. Nobody is confident enough to let characters that are olders than the writers themselves just do their thing. It's why their comics are failing and I think it'll eventually be the decline of the movies and shows."
Mr. Bean: The Animated Series,">Bedrock catches up with the Flintstone family two decades later, with Fred on the brink of retirement and 20-something Pebbles embarking on her own career. As the Stone Age gives way to a shiny and enlightened new Bronze Age, the residents of Bedrock will find this evolution harder than a swing from Bamm-Bamm’s club.

Cast:

* Elizabeth Banks as Pebbles
* Stephen Root as Fred
* Amy Sedaris as Wilma
* Nicole Byer as Betty
* Joe Lo Trulio as Barney
* Manny Jacinto as Bam Bam."
Mr. Bean: The Animated Series,"When someone inevitably comments “*Who wanted this?*”

It is I. I wanted a Flintstones animated reboot. 

Jetsons next, please, though that is overdue for its live action treatment that’s been collecting dust in Hollywood for ages."
Mr. Bean: The Animated Series,"Sounds like an interesting concept. I'll check it out. I hope the art style is similar to the original style and not some unique off putting hybrid. 

>Joe Lo Truglio as Barney

I'm sold."
Mr. Bean: The Animated Series,Manny Jacinto as Bam Bam is absolutely perfect casting
Mr. Bean: The Animated Series,Wasn't Seth MacFarlane trying to develop a Flintstones reboot at one point?
Mr. Bean: The Animated Series,Stephen Root is amazing.
Mr. Bean: The Animated Series,Is this based on the comic where [Yabababadoo](https://loginportal.funnyjunk.com/comments/I+greatly+enjoyed+the+flintstones+comic+_3630d2d2c835f69a58fe8575740d3a76.jpg) is a nonsense phrase to help veterans deal with trama from the war?
Mr. Bean: The Animated Series,Amy Sedaris is a national treasure. I will watch anything she is a part of.
Mr. Bean: The Animated Series,"Whether this turns out to be good or not, if you are a Flintstones fan, you absolutely owe it to yourself to read the DC comic by Steve Pugh!

It's such a truly fantastic retelling of the story and creates a very nuanced and much more interesting Bedrock."
Mr. Bean: The Animated Series,"I hope they take inspiration from the recent Flintstones Comics, which really delved into modern issues as reflected in the weird Paleolithic pastiche of The Flintstones universe. [Like Fred's pals Adam and Steve.](https://imgur.com/gallery/1sb55) 

[Or this infamous panel.](https://external-preview.redd.it/XahAdnM9U9vhLUmGkHlK3IRQw3jDzOlfSVl31KuVzyU.jpg?auto=webp&v=enabled&s=e2449c02c1798f8941b05266f8386e7fe515a9aa) 

It's a fantastic satire."
Mr. Bean: The Animated Series,Hire Mark Russell!! His 12 issue comic series on them is GOLD!
Mr. Bean: The Animated Series,Elizabeth Banks and Manny Jacinto as the adult pebbles and bambam makes so much sense in a way I really can't explain.
Mr. Bean: The Animated Series,Alright. This sounds really cool.
Mr. Bean: The Animated Series,Of wow it’s happening. Last time I heard of a flinstones reboot it was sarah underwood on attack of the show on G4 announced that Seth MacFarlane was going to run it. Then right after that Kevin Pereira made a fun adult comment that went over my too young boy brain.
Mr. Bean: The Animated Series,"Hope it takes some inspiration from the 2010s DC Comics reimagining of the Flintstones, which I recommend people check out."
Mr. Bean: The Animated Series,Yo that cast looks bonkers! Bortles!
Mr. Bean: The Animated Series,This is something I didn't realize I wanted until I read about it LOL
Mr. Bean: The Animated Series,"> Manny Jacinto as Bamm-Bamm.

Dope."
Mr. Bean: The Animated Series,Now I've got that Ram Jam song in my head.
Mr. Bean: The Animated Series,Wow that’s a pretty talented/funny lineup behind the voices
Mr. Bean: The Animated Series,"I have nothing against it personally, but why is it okay for other races to be cast for a white role (disclaimer: I’m not white), but when a white person plays a non-white role (like the Simpsons cast, for example) people are “offended”?"
Mr. Bean: The Animated Series,Seth McFarlane had this reboot ready to go and they shelved it at the very last second.
Mr. Bean: The Animated Series,I really hope there is some Boyle Boys' love between Fred and Barney.
Mr. Bean: The Animated Series,"I smell another ""Velma""."
Mr. Bean: The Animated Series,Didn’t  Seth MacFarlane work on this for years?
Mr. Bean: The Animated Series,"let me guess, Fred and Barney are dumbasses and Wilma is the real empowered deal"
Mr. Bean: The Animated Series,Predictions on who is gay? I’m going with bam bam.
Mr. Bean: The Animated Series,Ok this is what we need
Mr. Bean: The Animated Series,I was wondering if anyone would revisit this property soon and here we are. Interested to see how it turns out.
Mr. Bean: The Animated Series,“Idk cast the latino as bam bam”
Mr. Bean: The Animated Series,More trash 🤮🤢
Mr. Bean: The Animated Series,https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=lZAqlx_9lv0
Mr. Bean: The Animated Series,Of course Wilma is voiced by a black woman.
Mr. Bean: The Animated Series,Just please don't Velma it.
Mr. Bean: The Animated Series,I hope this doesn't replace The Great North.
Mr. Bean: The Animated Series,"is it going to have horrible modern flash animation


also nicole byer so totally does not seem like Betty at all"
Mr. Bean: The Animated Series,[removed]
Mr. Bean: The Animated Series,How?
Mr. Bean: The Animated Series,"This is going to be another Velma, right?"
Mr. Bean: The Animated Series,You had me at Lynn and Charles Boyle as Fred and Barney.
Mr. Bean: The Animated Series,This is still a thing?  I assumed this had died years ago.
Mr. Bean: The Animated Series,I remember Seth MacFarlane wanted to be involved in this.  Almost Sade he isn't.
Mr. Bean: The Animated Series,"If you want to do an adult oriented (Bit of a misnomer since the cartoon was Primetime in the 60s) Flintstones, they should go with the comic DC put out a few years ago."
Mr. Bean: The Animated Series,You know I'm kind of interested in the premise. A technological shift from the Stone Age to the Bronze Age? I dunno that sounds like an interesting jump start.
Mr. Bean: The Animated Series,"Solid as hell cast there.

 Now they just need to toss in Paul reubens as the great gazoo."
Mr. Bean: The Animated Series,So is this before Bamm bamm and pebbles had a kid?
Mr. Bean: The Animated Series,Were the bronze and stone ages only 20 years apart? 😜
Mr. Bean: The Animated Series,You had me at Amy Sedaris.
Mr. Bean: The Animated Series,Holy shit Manny Jacinto as Bam Bam is an awesome casting choice.
Mr. Bean: The Animated Series,Stephen root as Fred is an instant sold for me
Mr. Bean: The Animated Series,I want a continuation of the Harvey Birdman Flintstones.
Mr. Bean: The Animated Series,"I’m honestly surprised how long it’s taken for a true to form reboot. This premise looks interesting, but just making a modern take on the original feels like a nobrainer. It’s not like sitcoms ever went out of style."
Mr. Bean: The Animated Series,"Jetsons would be cool, that 60s retrofuturism and so on... I know people have this head canon of them being in the sky and the earth being a dead zone beneath.  I think that's a bit too much, but I like the idea of other cities being the future as envisioned by other decades.  So we have an 80s cyberpunk city, a 30s deco city like Metropolis, a Y2K silver/aqua fluid organic type of city, etc..."
Mr. Bean: The Animated Series,"Also, Seth MacFarlane. He's talked about it a lot, and I'm guessing he's sad he's not involved with this"
Mr. Bean: The Animated Series,We need Danny Devito as Mr Spacely.
Mr. Bean: The Animated Series,They’ve been trying to make this for a long time. It was attached to Seth Macfarlane. I think he used to talk about it in interviews.
Mr. Bean: The Animated Series,"They need to make a live action Jetsons ASAP, while Danny DeVito is still around to play Mr. Spacely."
Mr. Bean: The Animated Series,"""Who wanted this?"" is the dumbest (whatever it's called... *trope statement*?) that has ever existed.

Are creators supposed to poll everyone before they create? Fuck off

The most awarded movie in cinema history,  EEAAOA... did anybody want that?"
Mr. Bean: The Animated Series,"There are a lot of shows you can justifiably ask, ""Why?"" This is not one of them."
Mr. Bean: The Animated Series,"Yeah, but one true to the original, no?  Or what are you hoping for?"
Mr. Bean: The Animated Series,"This appears not to be a reboot, but a sequel."
Mr. Bean: The Animated Series,"Joe Lo Truglio and Nicole Byer being Barney and Betty is inspired. And manny jacinto as their son?

Cue the vince mcmahon meme"
Mr. Bean: The Animated Series,"""Every time I have a problem I hit it with a club and scream out my own name and just like that I have a new problem."""
Mr. Bean: The Animated Series,"Oh man, Bam Bam figured it out? This is a new low."
Mr. Bean: The Animated Series,Oh dear heavens it's Jason.
Mr. Bean: The Animated Series,"""BORTLES-BORTLES!"""
Mr. Bean: The Animated Series,"yes, amazing casting"
Mr. Bean: The Animated Series,Very inspired casting.
Mr. Bean: The Animated Series,"Apparently part of the reason it didn’t pan out was because he couldn’t figure out how to distinguish Fred from Peter Griffin. Not that he *wanted* them to be similar, he genuinely didn’t seem to know Fred acts nothing like Peter to begin with. That should tell you everything."
Mr. Bean: The Animated Series,"That fizzled out about a decade ago.

He doesn't seem interested in making animated sitcoms anymore."
Mr. Bean: The Animated Series,Thankfully that didn't work out. Don't think we need the Flintstones with rape jokes.
Mr. Bean: The Animated Series,Yes
Mr. Bean: The Animated Series,"The link is broken, but I don't believe it's based on the recent satire series."
Mr. Bean: The Animated Series,"Have you, by chance, seen [The Drunk and On Drugs Happy Funtime Hour?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Drunk_and_On_Drugs_Happy_Funtime_Hour)"
Mr. Bean: The Animated Series,Exit Stage Left the Snaglepuss Story is also a phenomenal examination of McCarthism and its effects on the theater industry and I'm not even joking
Mr. Bean: The Animated Series,What an odd tone. Is there comedy in between or is it just straight up serious/dramatic the entire time?
Mr. Bean: The Animated Series,"I've been reading the series recently and it's been fantastic. Really good satire about everything from capitalism, consumerism to PTSD. Highly recommend."
Mr. Bean: The Animated Series,">Homo Erectus

Brilliant."
Mr. Bean: The Animated Series,Literally only clicked this thread to see if someone mentioned the comic. Great little series.
Mr. Bean: The Animated Series,"The issue that most people have isn’t that voice actors can only voice characters that are the same race as they are. The issue is that in an industry that is predominantly white, even the few POC roles that exist often go to white actors."
Mr. Bean: The Animated Series,Isn’t it for a voice role?
Mr. Bean: The Animated Series,because white people bad
Mr. Bean: The Animated Series,Because white actors aren’t underrepresented in media. Now can people stop asking this question?
Mr. Bean: The Animated Series,"I'm still wondering why if a character is biracial, it's not okay for a whole white person to play the part, but it IS okay for a whole black person to play the part."
Mr. Bean: The Animated Series,That was my first thought too. Like isn’t this supposed to be racist now?
Mr. Bean: The Animated Series,"The secret is no one really cares about that either. Most of it has been voice actors voluntarily stepping down. 

I dont think just about any regular person cares."
Mr. Bean: The Animated Series,I mean that would be just like the original...
Mr. Bean: The Animated Series,"So, The Flintstones then."
Mr. Bean: The Animated Series,"Too easy. Actually it will be revealed that Barney and Fred were, uh, more than friends all this time."
Mr. Bean: The Animated Series,"It's one thing to be racist, and another to be so racist you can't tell the difference between latinos and someone who's chinese-fillipino."
Mr. Bean: The Animated Series,Jfc y'all can't even get your fake outrage right.
Mr. Bean: The Animated Series,"Yea that’s actually a solid spin on the original. Turn Fred & Wilma into Boomers who don’t get new tech.

What do you mean you drive without feet now?"
Mr. Bean: The Animated Series,"Relevant

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyu4u3VZYaQ"
Mr. Bean: The Animated Series,The Great Gazoo is honestly not even one of the top 10 stupidest things on the original show. Everyone just ignores that there's a Bewitched crossover in it for no apparent reason.
Mr. Bean: The Animated Series,oh hell yes I need Pee-Wee Herman as Great Gazoo
Mr. Bean: The Animated Series,"""Don't do that. Don't make me hope"""
Mr. Bean: The Animated Series,"They were 0 years apart.

But the Bronze Age was not 20 years away from the dinosaurs."
Mr. Bean: The Animated Series,"No, but they also didn't celebrate Christmas and have talking elephant vacuum cleaners during the stone age."
Mr. Bean: The Animated Series,"I mean it depends what you mean, parts of the Neolithic age was technically.

Of course due to lack of safe travel in those days and scarcity of resources, you could cross from the stone age into the bronze age and back again, over a span of maybe two hundred miles."
Mr. Bean: The Animated Series,Your dead to me can opener!
Peter Rabbit,So is the Lakes District astro turfing for tourism in a global pandemic or what?
Peter Rabbit,"So, I guess their goal today was to take everyone who said D+ had no original content besides The Mandalorian, and pretty much punch them in the face repeatedly."
Peter Rabbit,Hooch is crazy

Peter Rabbit,I thought this was wallstreebets DD for a second lol
Peter Rabbit,"Nothing on any of the ""old"" Netflix series has me sad...  Nice write up, though."
Peter Rabbit,/u/arashtp you missed Percy Jackson.
Peter Rabbit,Super stoked on most of this. I’m especially looking forward to the Nat geo content. Can you imagine if Disney+ dropped with half of these titles? Game changer
Peter Rabbit,"Based on the release timelines of those shows, it looks like their strategy is: 

Zeitgeist show for 6 weeks -> 1 week of cool down —> couple weeks of hype up -> next Zeitgeist show -> Repeat"
Peter Rabbit,They're really going all out with the High Republic.
Peter Rabbit,did She Hulk get a trailer or anything?
Peter Rabbit,that's a lot of content
Peter Rabbit,"So strange to realize Ice Age is owned by Disney now. 

Also I’m sort of unexpectedly excited about the continuation of Mighty Ducks!"
Peter Rabbit,A Turner and Hooch reboot yyyeeeeessss!!! I've been a fan (we call ourselves Hoochers) for years and am flipping out right now!!!!
Peter Rabbit,Missing rogue squadron on Star Wars
Peter Rabbit,Hocus Pocus 2. What.
Peter Rabbit,"A lot of this is awesome, but can I just take a moment to appreciate *Sister Act 3*?"
Peter Rabbit,">Tiana is the first princess to have her own Walt Disney Animation Studios series

Just going to ignore the Little Mermaid and Tangled series apparently."
Peter Rabbit,[deleted]
Peter Rabbit,I have only read a hand full of moon knight comics but from what I have heard and read making a PG moon knight show is not going to go over well with fans.
Peter Rabbit,Any specific dates to go with this?
Peter Rabbit,You forgot the multiple tongue in cheek references to Matt Murdock.  Charlie Cox's Daredevil is officially part of the MCU now.  Hes apparently in She Hulk and Spider-Man 3.
Peter Rabbit,"Damn, the Ducks end up becoming what they rebelled against..."
Peter Rabbit,"As a bi dude I'm still waiting for literally anything big that features a non-straight dude. In film they ignored it almost completely out of fear of gay-hating countries banning it and them losing money (like China). 

Really hoping for something to come through, maybe with x-men back in the fold Iceman could get something"
Peter Rabbit,So is Ahsoka taking the place of the Rebels spinoff? Because thats what I was most excited for
Peter Rabbit,Disney is milking Star Wars and Marvel for everything dollar they can squeeze. There are way too many reboots and remakes. They need originally sourced content that has no reliance on existing IP. How about some original NON-Marvel/Star Wars scripted content? I think the Mandalorian is a cute show but I want to see ORIGINAL content for once. This slate of shows are not enough to keep all of their subscribers satisfied.
Peter Rabbit,I just want to have the spin off Thrawn and Ezra travels in space show.
Peter Rabbit,"Hey, bozo, why didn't you mention It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia?

Great list, otherwise."
Peter Rabbit,so much content that post alone made me vomit .
Peter Rabbit,Seems like Star Wars's future is on TV.
Peter Rabbit,Is it weird that I'm most excited for the Josh Peck version of Turner and Hooch?
Peter Rabbit,"Looks like they're updating Microcosmos with A Real Bug's Life, that should be cool as fuck."
Peter Rabbit,">The Mighty Ducks: Game Changers

>Lauren Graham (Gilmore Girls, Parenthood) and Emilio Estevez (reprising his role from the original feature films) star in the next chapter of the hit Mighty Ducks franchise, premiering in early 2021. In present day Minnesota, the Mighty Ducks have evolved from scrappy underdogs to an ultra-competitive, powerhouse youth hockey team. After 12-year-old Evan is unceremoniously cut from the Ducks, he and his mom Alex set out to build their own ragtag team of misfits to challenge the cutthroat, win-at-all-costs culture of competitive youth sports.

I hope Disney has been paying attn to Cobra Kai and takes all the good from it and applies it to the Ducks!!!"
Peter Rabbit,"Man, Tony Stark cannot keep control of his tech, can he? Well, I guess he's dead, so that makes sense."
Peter Rabbit,The one thing I want from Marvel is an OG Nick Fury and the Howling Commandos show.
Peter Rabbit,They forgot Shadow Hunters.
Peter Rabbit,Disney+ launch was more like beta test to ensure their decision of allocating such resources to the platform
Peter Rabbit,"The criticism was regarding lack of original screenplays, too. It's still true in that aspect."
Peter Rabbit,"It's still lacks diversity, it's still marvel, star wars and Pixar animated pg-13 movies, still no new new IPs."
Peter Rabbit,[deleted]
Peter Rabbit,"If they don't have Phill Lewis playing the dog using mocap, they dun goofed."
Peter Rabbit,*holds up lighter*
Peter Rabbit,Thanks man you're awesome
Peter Rabbit,[Rogue squadron](https://youtu.be/5bLkTjn6Y_s)
Peter Rabbit,Not enough 🚀🚀🚀
Peter Rabbit,"Just hints at Daredevil, from Sony in Spider-Man 3 and at the reveal here today for She-Hulk."
Peter Rabbit,"Yeah sounds like the Multiverse in SM3 will pull in Daredevil and Kingpin. Which could be great.

Daredevil was hinted at strongly for SheHulk, and there have been rumors that DNofrio has campaigned hard and they’ve taken him seriously as maybe using his character to put together the Sinister Six."
Peter Rabbit,"There's a big hint in Hawkeye. Maya Lopez is a definitively Daredevil character (Echo, a deaf woman who can see something once and imitate it originally hired by Kingpin to take out Daredevil and eventually befriending him). She also wore the Ronin outfit for awhile that Hawkeye wore in Endgame after his family vanished (New Avengers comics).

Edit: why am I being downvoted for this?"
Peter Rabbit,And Swiss Family Robinson.
Peter Rabbit,It’s pretty genius
Peter Rabbit,Super into the Acolyte as I’d really like to see what the Sith/dark side users were up to during this time period
Peter Rabbit,"No, but they confirmed Tatiana Maslany."
Peter Rabbit,Tim Roth will be back as Abomination and Mark Ruffalo.
Peter Rabbit,Its a rather deceptive line if your not in the know.  WDAS is the movie studio. Disney Television Animation is the studio that typically handles the TV side (they were the ones that made the Tangled series).
Peter Rabbit,That's not necessarily a bad thing tbh. It's how they execute it that matters. GOTG was kinda considered a bottom of the barrel IP for marvel before they made it and it turned out well.
Peter Rabbit,"There’s like 70 announced shows here and less than 10 are actual original ideas. Really disappointing *in my opinion*.

I get people like Star Wars and stuff, but it seems extreme to me."
Peter Rabbit,"I think it could be done. For me at least the fun part is the mind-bendy unreliable narrator stuff and not the graphic violence. Although there is something to be said for when other characters meet Moon Knight and are like, ""oh this guy is *crazy* crazy and not just *Batman* crazy."""
Peter Rabbit,"This didn’t mention any of the Marvel movies since it’s still not certain whether they’ll be released in theaters first or on Disney+ at the same time, but The Eternals is set to have their first openly gay main character whenever that’s released.

If you haven’t watched the Disney+ short film Out, you absolutely should."
Peter Rabbit,"Young Avengers is just over the horizon, and that comes with the most prominent gay couple in marvel. Still a few years out though."
Peter Rabbit,Not sure if it is 100% confirmed but I remember seeing somewhere that Valkyrie is looking for a wife in the next Thor movie.
Peter Rabbit,"As a fellow homo, I'm sorry you're getting downvoted, but that's r/television for you. I've learned not to bring up representation issues on this sub anymore."
Peter Rabbit,"I would bet it will be in a team, or they will reveal the character is gay in a sequel...that way people in China will already be invested.  Because you’re right....they want that China money badly. 


Wouldn’t it be a kick in the nuts to China if the wait until like Shang Chi 3 and reveal he was gay the whole time! Lmao. That could literally start a war!!"
Peter Rabbit,"I feel like this'll be a big part of the Ashoka show, considering that she was still searching when we see her in The Mandolorian."
Peter Rabbit,Thats not on Disney+ you 1 star fool.
Peter Rabbit,That’s pathetic
Peter Rabbit,I really don't like the sound of this. The whole point of the Ducks is that they are scrappy underdogs. Having them become what they played against feels kind of weird. And it's obviously gonna end with both Ducks teams playing against each other. It just sounds weird to me.
Peter Rabbit,"They're going all in because they've lost all profits from Disney parks and tourism, 75% of their revenue.

Also why they gutted ESPN"
Peter Rabbit,"Certainly, but was anyone really expecting that? Aside from Pixar, Disney hasn't done an original story in... I'm not sure. Possibly ever."
Peter Rabbit,Pixar films are all new IPs lol
Peter Rabbit,[deleted]
Peter Rabbit,One Star Wars IP will drive more total interest than anything on HBO Max lmao
Peter Rabbit,"Uh ""Win or Lose"" is a new IP."
Peter Rabbit,"You are soo right. Marvel has been overdone, it's a stale medium at this point.  SW feels the same after the last 3 movies. Even Mando is aimless with no real main plotline.

It's so formulaic it isn't appealing.

Will smith movie,
Cars tv show, 
SW, SW, SW, SW, SW
Marvel movies or shows of all side movie characters, because why not saturate the market with bland superheros"
Peter Rabbit,"Yeah. Did anyone really expect Disney to do something genuinely new? Aside from Pixar, which still has very niche content, I can't remember the last time Disney did an actually new story. 

It's one of the reasons this obsession people on here have with D+ ""killing"" Netflix is so silly."
Peter Rabbit,Well original content in this context means content that is developed specificity for the platform and is owned by Disney
Peter Rabbit,"
>Daredevil was hinted at strongly for SheHulk...

That doesn't excite me...  I don't see Daredevil remaining dark and gritty if placed in She-Hulk.  SH over the years has been more of a fun loving character."
Peter Rabbit,"It's going to be interesting to see how Tim Roth plays his take on Mark Ruffalo. 

&nbsp;

^^i ^^jest"
Peter Rabbit,[deleted]
Peter Rabbit,"It's a Disney property.

They a announced it today, as well.

It actually appears on traditional broadcast television, anyone who can't see this **IS A SAVAGE AND AN IDIOT**.

Stoked about almost all of these, though."
Peter Rabbit,Most of these projects are planned before the COVID
Peter Rabbit,Different services provide different content. I dont see why that's only an issue when it's Disney. How much Oscar winning animated content do we see on HBO or Netflix?
Peter Rabbit,Duh.  If you want Disney's adult content you mosey over to Hulu.  If you've been looking at the end of the year critics' lists you'll have noticed Disney is beating Netflix and Warnerbrothers decisively when it comes to critical acclaim.
Peter Rabbit,Disney doesn’t give a fuck about that. They care about commercial success of which they aren’t matched.
Peter Rabbit,The show is listed as a comedy. Not sure how Charlie's Matt Murdock would fit into that.
Peter Rabbit,"I get it. But AntMan seemed really dumb to me. So did Thor at the time, and GotG is when I thought they had given up. 

I think the Series will be used to set up bigger events in the movies.  Almost like a Rogue One to Star Wars.  

That way people who want more background will have it, and yet you don’t HAVE to have seen it to follow the movies.  

Also Ironheart, Kate Bishop, Ms Marvel and I’m betting a Young Loki will get set up for a Secret Avengers movie."
Peter Rabbit,"Armor Wars is widely considered one of the best, if not the best period, Iron Man stories.

We’ll most likely see Justin Hammer return and the intro of some other big Iron Man villains like Crimson Dynamo.

I wouldn’t call it bottom of the barrel. The only difference is that War Machine will he finally getting the spotlight rather than Iron Man"
Peter Rabbit,"Well, you have to remember, when they first started making Marvel movies, Iron Man was a very odd choice in how to begin."
Peter Rabbit,Yes.  Can they only make outer space/superhero stuff?  That’s not the only genre.
Peter Rabbit,"Well, I don't agree with ALL the nominations, I think this is a pretty good list! I think Pedro Pascal had better win best reoccurring character! And again, I would have included GoT in Best Television Show (I mean, come on! Season 4 was the best season yet!) I do agree that True Detective and The Returned are awesome nominations. Can't wait for the final results.  "
The Garfield Show,"Thanks to Harvey Birdman, I can't look at old Hanna Barbera cartoons in the same way anymore.

Like Peter Potamus sending things. "
The Garfield Show,[still the best commercial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPo4WHB6HaI)
The Garfield Show,">asylum  
  
Did you mean sanctuary?  

Either way I agree. New cartoons are far too frenetic for me.  
I mean I get they're for kids, but old cartoons were for kids also,  
but they didn't have that spastic energy I find so grating.   
(OK there were some like this. i.e. Ren and Stimpy)  
That's not even mentioning the constant cynicism that passes for humor."
The Garfield Show,Every child should be at least somewhat well versed in old cartoons. It's gonna be very strange that the next generation will have had next to no exposure to those shows unless their parents were avid fans. 
The Garfield Show,"I mean to be frank I think most Hanna-Barbara cartoons are objectively awful when you look at them without rose-colored glasses (The Flintstones is supposed to be the best one? [The comic timing and laugh track are just AWFUL](https://youtube.com/watch?v=KqPka4pvrMc)), and I preferred 90s cartoons over that.

Yes, the channel drift is rather sad, but at least it's not a TOTAL wasteland the way Nicktoons and TeenNick are."
The Garfield Show,I know the feeling. I'm still bitter about Sci-Fi's rebranding and that's a decade ago or close to it. 
The Garfield Show,The rebranding was honestly criminal. Horrible decision
The Garfield Show,"The true ""Nick2"" should be a Nick@Nite network. Morning to evening would be progression from 50's-90's sitcoms. Then specific blocks according to the day until the early morning when the cycle begins anew."
The Garfield Show,"In my country, Toonami used to be where shows like Batman: the Animated Series, Superman: TAS, Young Justice, Teen Titans, Generator Rex, the original Ben 10, etc. It was replaced this year with Boomerang but not the Boomerang I know who showcased Hanna Barbera TV series. RIP Channel 42."
The Garfield Show,Rebranding killed tech-tv/G4. i loved the old cartoons and watching boomerang to kill time between other shows.
The Garfield Show,I miss having 90s marvel cartoons to watch after a night of drinking.
The Garfield Show,Seems like what you want is still available in the Boomerang streaming service. 
The Garfield Show,Damn. I grew up on Boomerang and it’s sad to find out what’s happened to it. 
The Garfield Show,"When CN first launched it was pretty much Boomerang.  Then they started shifting to original content and created the block.  The CN evolution was pretty much as you just described for Boomerang.  History is repeating itself... [we're caught in a loop](https://www.reddit.com/r/television/comments/9vxq5v/three_years_later_im_still_bitter_about_the/e9g1pmd/)!

The same thing happens every time MTV tries to spin off a dedicated music video channel."

The Garfield Show,"I adore all the old school Hanna-Barbera cartoons, but once I realised that they were slowly going away, I’ve been collecting the DVDs, which, surprisingly, Warner Archive have been releasing a lot of the obscure shows for years. I got The Herculoids and Shazzan last month. Anybody remember those? "
The Garfield Show,I miss the weird shit....OG Space Ghost and The Herculoids and Harvey Birdman....before the Adult Swim parody versions. That and Thundarr the Barbarian was some trippy shit.
The Garfield Show,"I can't believe it's been 3 years since the rebranding. It breaks my heart to see something that had an impact on me growing deminish into a cold soulless channel. As a kid I would go to my semi-wealthy grandparents house in a suburb outside of St. Louis. I would hang out in the guest room up stairs with my twin sister and watch Boomerang to avoid the awkwardness that would go on downstairs between my grandparents and my parents. (We really don't know them well and they don't know us well.) Until we eventually got to go into St. Louis to visit the Zoo while they were at mass. 

We finally got the network for ourselves when I was in 6th grade and the day we got it my parents, my twin sister and I we all hung out in the living room watching the Jetsons, Flintstones, Looney Toons, and Top Cat until we got tired off it. 

In my final years of high school (just before the rebrand) I had a bad night (courtesy of my POTS syndrome) and couldn't sleep. In that night I discovered a show called ""MGM"" which would show a mishmash of shorts like Droopy, Barney Bear, Screwball squirrel, and a bunch of other things that could be called nothing but an hour of misc. cartoons. I LOVED IT! On Friday nights and during the summer I'd watch The Late Late show with Craig Ferguson and then do everything in my power to stay awake just to watch it. (It was quite difficult since it came on at 2:00 in the morning.) And it was even there when I needed it. I couldn't stay for my graduation ""Last Blast"" because I had a POTS (my heart condition) meltdown and got sick. I was devastated but I got home, climbed into bed and saw it was on and knew things would be okay.

That was when Boomerang was gold."
The Garfield Show,One of the most professional comments I have ever heard of and or read in a reddit related comment. I miss that channel..
The Garfield Show,"There are certainly some shows I miss from boomerang, Johnny Quest and scooby doo where are you! I just feel most of these cartoons have better modern versions, just simply because the old laugh tracks and story beats dont hold up. The only cartoon that is really old and still holds up imo is Looney Tunes and Tom and Jerry. "
The Garfield Show,"Baby boomers? Wrong generation, my friend. We're known as Generation X."
The Garfield Show,Did. You. Get. That. Thing. I. Sent. You.
The Garfield Show,Umm have you never seen Jabberjaw?
The Garfield Show,Yes!
The Garfield Show,That's honestly one of the weakest.
The Garfield Show,"I agree. I mean, they don't have to know *all* the obscure ones (Atom Ant, anyone?) but they should know Yogi Bear and Huckleberry Hound."
The Garfield Show,"> Every child should be at least somewhat well versed in old cartoons.



I disagree completely. Let the kids have their new cartoons and leave them alone. Honestly i don’t think it’s that important, there’s way more stuff to be concerned about instead of whether my kid knows old cartoons and frankly I just don’t have the time. It’s too trivial.



Ive shown my daughter and nephew the different versions of some shows that I grew up with just out of fun around Xmas (Powerpuff girls, SpiderMan, Batman, ninja turtles etc), they’re intrigued by how everything looks a bit different but they’re not really that fussed, preferring their newer versions. As long as they’re happy I’m happy.

"
The Garfield Show,They have Dvds.
The Garfield Show,Just watch a bunch of Harvey Birdman and pick it up from there. 
The Garfield Show,"Yeah, I remember growing up so screwed-up because I didn't watch Steamboat Willie back in the day. /s"
The Garfield Show,No child needs to be brainwashed and indoctrinated by pop culture from decades ago. It should not be a requirement of existing in functioning society.

The Garfield Show,"Teennick is the most pathetic channel in history. Every attempt it's made on launching a not-Degrassi show has completely and miserably failed. *And then Netflix bought the U.S. broadcast rights to Degrassi's new series.* To this day it does not have an HD feed, and has mostly aired reruns of the Schneider's Bakery shows in hours long blocks."
The Garfield Show,Haven't watched Flintstones in years. Does it really not hold up? Always assumed it did considering how important it is in animation history. 
The Garfield Show,The Flintstones are even a rip-off of 'The Honeymooners.' At least we got an inexplicably amazing comic series out of it in 2016.  
The Garfield Show,"That's a lie, you take that back.

>I mean to be frank I think most Hanna-Barbara cartoons are objectively awful when you look at them without rose-colored glasses (The Flintstones is supposed to be the best one? The comic timing and laugh track are just AWFUL), and I preferred 90s cartoons over that.

I was a 90s kid and old ass Hanna Barbera shit was better than the crap Cartoon Network was shoveling out in the 90s."
The Garfield Show,"> I mean to be frank I think most Hanna-Barbara cartoons are objectively awful 

The only thing particularly awful was how they reused the same premises over and over again. Scooby Doo and the 500 different Scooby Doo series not actually featuring Scooby, but a talking car or ghost or something.

Overall, HB's back catalogue holds up surprisingly well. HB's whole raison d'etre was to be a cheaper form of animation, so I don't think you can really hold that against them, and they were very much trailblazers when it came to broadening what cartoons could be. I suspect shows like The Simpsons would have had a much harder time coming in to being if not for shows like The Jetsons and The Flintstones establishing animation which was less focused on action and physical comedy, and more focused on grounded characters and stories."
The Garfield Show,[deleted]
The Garfield Show,"Yeah, I still get peeved at the whole ""Syfy"" thing. I miss those bumpers too."
The Garfield Show,The fuck do you expect? They were one day gonna rebrand it like most channels
The Garfield Show,Toonami was much more focused on anime
The Garfield Show,"Yeah, I miss G4 too. I used to watch it for *Ninja Warrior* and *X-Play* before NBC made it almost solely run *Cops* reruns."
The Garfield Show,"It didn't though. People who worked on the channel from Kevin to Adam all said the same thing about why things went badly. A lack of viewers, and NBC/Comcast merger causing there to be new higher ups who realllllllly didn't like the channel. People complain about Cops, but I've seen Sessler mention how it was getting more viewers than any of the non Ninja Warrior original programming on the channel and was basically the only thing keeping them afloat for as long as they were."
The Garfield Show,Without the bumpers though. That's my biggest gripe about streaming services. You can't shuffle anything you have to binge one show and you don't get bumpers. I loved the old Boomerang bumpers lol and I've been having a lot of trouble finding full recordings of the channel so I can watch it how I want
The Garfield Show,Please don't jinx MTV Classic
The Garfield Show,"Boomerang Australia is the same. No old cartoons whatsoever. There’s some occasional Looney Tunes which is good, but no Hanna Barbera in sight.

There’s not even any 90’s Cartoon Network on it, Cow and Chicken, I Am Weasel, Johnny Bravo etc. It’s really sad."
The Garfield Show,How did you get ahold of these?
The Garfield Show,Atleast Boomerang UK has LazyTown
The Garfield Show,"Yeah how can you forget a dinosaur that shoots rocks out of his horn, and some dumb ass blob."
The Garfield Show,"The Baby Boom was from 1946 to 1964. A good chunk of that generation would have been watching these cartoons, considering that Looney Tunes and Tom and Jerry both ran in the 50s."
The Garfield Show,"The OP specifically mentioned Hanna-Barbera, which many of their classic cartoons started in the 50's and 60's. Examples:

Yogi Bear (1958), Huckleberry Hound (1958), Top Cat (1961), The Jetsons (1962), Magill Gorilla (1964), Dastardly and Muttley (1969), etc.

OP is right with Baby Boomers. They would have been the children who originally grew up with those shows."

The Garfield Show,That one's good too! Here's a [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vn1pf0Xi3nU)
The Garfield Show,Isn’t there a pay channel app that has all the classic cartoons?  Not the best option but an option. 
The Garfield Show,"> Let the kids have their new cartoons

Why are you framing this as an either/or? 

When I was a kid, I watched the new stuff (Batman, Tale Spin, Darking Duck, TaleSpin, etc.) but I still watched plenty of classic cartoons as well.

And not just cartoons. The Addams Family is still one of my favorite sitcoms, despite the fact that I was born over 20 years after it was canceled."
The Garfield Show,"I didn't know that opinion would prove to be so controversial, lol. I guess I should clarify that I meant it makes for a pretty good part of a complete cartoon diet; I watched some oldies on Boomerang as a child but still unquestionably preferred cartoons from my own time (Ones similar to what you grew up with, essentially), but that doesn't mean I didn't, from time to time, get curious about the stuff that wasn't brand new. 

I think there's value in broadening cultural horizons a little bit, but I was just making a silly, offhand observation. It's far from *crucial*, of course."
The Garfield Show,That’s sad that you don’t think teaching your kids about history is important. 
The Garfield Show,[deleted]
The Garfield Show,"In all seriousness, I watched my fair share and I just watched for the colors and funny looking characters; nowadays I can critically assess the troublesome aspects just fine. 

I'm not saying all children can, but I think it's the job of parents to teach kids what's acceptable and not, in such cases. We shouldn't ignore the past. We should learn from it."
The Garfield Show,"it actually should be in all honesty. maybe the kids will end up with higher IQs after being dumbed down so long from the likes of unikitty,etc"
The Garfield Show,"As someone who had to grow up with CONSTANT Scooby-Doo, Scooby-Doo spinoff and Scooby-Doo movie reruns, this does not appease me lol and I personally found the OG series to be horrendously slow when I last caught a rerun (although the existence of Scooby-Dum is good for meta humor lmfao)"
The Garfield Show,"Hey hey hey, O'Grady got TWO seasons! And was a great cartoon if you liked Home Movies!

Other than that yeah, joke of a channel even with NickSplat"
The Garfield Show,"Correction, they do have an HD feed. I know it’s carried by Verzion Fios in certain areas and as well as the Philo streaming service. Not sure why it’s not on most cable services though."
The Garfield Show,Superfriends is a close second.
The Garfield Show,"There's a link I like to show people where Fred and Wilma go bowling. YouTube it and then you tell me how you think it holds up, especially versus 90s Nicktoons or Cartoon Cartoons (Rocko is a show before my era, and I consider that one of my top 10 shows ever made)

Important to animation history =! still holds up. For another example, when you watch Ren and Stimpy today (at least the more-lauded Kricfalusi years, I have not watched more than a handful of Games-era episodes and don't plan to return to the show after dude got #MeToo'd), the comic timing on that one is also glacier slow and many shows like Flapjack do the gross-out close up shit better today. OTOH, very few children's shows have managed a mix of Looney Tunes-esque slapstick, sly innuendo and cultural satire the way Rocko's Modern Life did, although some things like OG SpongeBob, Animaniacs and Regular Show have gotten close."
The Garfield Show,The comic turned out better than I expected to be honest.
The Garfield Show,"I used to watch those and Looney Tunes with my grandpa growing up - when did you realize that some of them were from the 40’s, 50’s and some 60’s? It blew my mind whe I realized my grandpa and dad both kind of grew up on the exact same cartoons - although grandpa had to go to a theater to see them. "
The Garfield Show,Son you need check yourself. Hana-Barbera were notorious for shoveling out the same copy-paste shows for years. They threw everything at the wall and whatever stuck they milked it dry and made carbon copies of it. 90’s cartoons was the first big break for creators that can do whatever they wanted without having to be solely reliable on marketing toys
The Garfield Show,"Compare the animation and comic timing of Yogi Bear, Top Cat and Scooby Doo (without the laugh track for all 3 since that's how CN aired them) to Johnny Bravo, Ed Edd n Eddy or Courage the Cowardly Dog (or some classic 90s Nicktoons FWIW). Then compare BOTH of them to classic Looney Tunes. Personal preference out of the way, I think the quality difference is *heavily* apparent and there's a very good reason why both classic 40s theatrical cartoons and the 90s are considered renaissance eras for animation whereas Hanna-Barbara is... not..."
The Garfield Show,Tbh the only good actual HB show i would watch is Top Cat. The actual reason why I watched the channel is because of the bumpers and people on the internet saying that they miss the old boomerang are probably kids who never even saw the original channel
The Garfield Show,"I don't wanna disregard the importance of Hanna-Barbara's influence, certainly the success of The Flintstones was key to letting The Simpsons happen decades later.

I also don't think ""limited animation"" is necessarily an excuse for bad comic writing, and I think the comic timing of HB (like I said to another guy, Google the clip where Fred and Wilma go bowling) is incredibly dated when held against other limited animation shows that took HB influence like Dexter's Lab, Clone High or half of adult swim."
The Garfield Show,"I like plenty of Gen X comedy shows (well, 90s sitcoms) and the kids cartoons I like as a lazy hipster college kid are oftentimes the same ones late-period Gen X liked as lazy hipster college kids (like Rocko, The Tick, Animaniacs, etc;)"
The Garfield Show,I don't remember much anime being shown in Toonami SEA. It was mostly animated DC series and those produced by Dwayne McDuffie. I do remember a whole block dedicated to Dragonball Z though.
The Garfield Show,"Even then that was a rebranding for folks who like screensavers and Extended Play. 

In the end it got turned from a pure tech show to spike tv. "
The Garfield Show,Because the rebranding took focus away from the gaming aspect and made it like a knock off spike tv. Given how big gaming still is if they never had tried to appeal to a broader audience but focused on gaming things might of been different. it was just at that time people thought things like watching other people play games and making competitive gaming had no interest. Shows like Arena would be huge now and reviews and lets plays are dominating youtube. its just by the time we got there it was already too late. Im not saying youre wrong but the rebranding had a huge factor in turning people away. 
The Garfield Show,I didn't even realize there was another one.  :P
The Garfield Show,"[Boomerang Germany](https://www.tvdigital.de/sender/boomerang) and Scandinavia used to have some classics like The Addams Family, Top Cat, Flintstones, Jetsons,... The program list is horrible now though."
The Garfield Show,i have a motorised sat dish
The Garfield Show,ugh... 
The Garfield Show,"That stuff is tail end of the boomer era. 60s is early GenX, and most of the stuff on Boomerang when it began was 60s and 70s toons.

OP got it from Wikipedia which makes the claim unsourced (presumably because the wiki editor saw the 'boom' in 'boomerang', put two and two together and got five)."
The Garfield Show,Don’t forget Josie and the Pussycats evolution of music and the board game Johnny quest 
The Garfield Show,It's not just the cartoons though. It was the whole vibe of the channel too that made Boomerang stand out.
The Garfield Show,DVDs.
The Garfield Show,VRV is allegedly getting classic Boomerang content.
The Garfield Show,If they pursue a career in animation then sure but otherwise it's not really *that* important. I won't force my kids to sit down and watch Casablanca unless they wanted to watch it. 
The Garfield Show,"-Meanwhile, at the Legion of Doom...

-Not now!

-Okay."
The Garfield Show,"Johnny Bravo sucked, as did Ed, Edd, and Eddy, Cow and Chicken, I am Weasel, I are Baboon. Powerpuff girls, grim adventures, and courage were *tolerable* and in the same vein as the 90s classics nick was putting out. I'm not saying 90s cartoons sucked, I'm saying Cartoon Network was shoveling shit until the 2000s

I'll watch top cat or yogi any day of the week over shit like johnny bravo. And those were weaker shows. Shit, I'd watch the show where they flew around the world in a blimp over johnny bravo"
The Garfield Show,"To be clear, I'm was being literal in referencing the cheap animation. Not as it relates to the writing or anything else, just the animation in and of itself. It was designed to be quick and cheap, it was the McDonaldsification of animation.

As for the writing and comic timing, I wouldn't really expect brilliance there, either. I struggle to go back and watch most 90's sitcoms (I'm basically down to 3rd Rock and Seinfeld at this point), let alone kid's shows from half a century ago, aping the sitcoms of that era. The Flintstones and Jetsons is only as watchable as its contemporaries, and I don't make a point of watching a lot of The Honeymooners or I Dream of Jeannie, either. Dad's Army is about as far back as I can go and still genuinely enjoy myself."
The Garfield Show,"You're missing the point here. From the words of the people who actually worked there, for pretty much their entire run, they only really had enough viewers to just barely not get cancelled and never got above that, so when the merger happened they got higher-ups looking at the channel and wanting it to do much better than scraping the bar which they never managed to do. You can make theories or assumptions, but I'm going to choose to believe that the people who actually worked there are the ones who are right about why things happened the way they did."
The Garfield Show,"Ah, I thought you streamed them online."
The Garfield Show,"Uh yeah and the tail-end of the baby boomers would've grown up watching the cartoons that aired in the 60s. The tail end of the Baby Boomer generation is the mid-50s, and those people would've been children when many of those cartoons were airing. "
The Garfield Show,"Yes yes yes! And High School Jim's ""Yogi Bear"" too"
The Garfield Show,The nostalgia is too much
The Garfield Show,The only channel I let my kids watch when they were kids was Boomerang.  That backfired a bit when the only thing they wanted for Christmas was the Johnny Quest game.
The Garfield Show,It’s a shame but channels rebrand all the time to try to stay profitable.  When’s the last time you saw a music video on mtv or non garbage tv on the arts and entertainment channel A&E.
The Garfield Show,"Well, that's personal preference. I'm arguing that the writing and animation are better from an objective point of view, and I submit the clip I linked in the first comment as evidence.

I also think Cow And Chicken is garbage and I'd personally rather watch Yogi (but would rather watch neither), but from a writing and animation perspective (well, fluidity and movement perspective, HB has them beat on good character design) its blatantly apparent that the C&C writers had actual jokes in their script and weren't recycling old assets because of a budget of food stamps.

EDIT: Billy and Mandy is the only cartoon you listed that isn't from the 90s, and if any show can show the difference in era limitations it's that one since the animation is usually only so much less limited than HB but the scripting is TIGHT and the jokes don't stop flying, although in later seasons more jokes missed."
The Garfield Show,"Okay, fair point about the animation and whether you hold it against them or not is subjective I suppose, I actually don't too hard because they at least knew appealing character and background design, even if that shit was recycled constantly, and I understand it was a totally different era when it came to budgeting television animation. (Still, I don't blame animation historians for shitting on them constantly)

I also do understand that comic timing is harder to judge from a contemporary perspective, but I'm less forgiving on that because as you almost certainly implied, why would I watch that when there's better stuff out there? I actually probably like more old stuff than you the way you described it (no fan of NewsRadio, The Larry Sanders Show or Strangers With Candy?) but going to pre-90s TV cartoons feels like a waste of time to me."
The Garfield Show,"the point im making isint about what actually happened there. im giving a what if statement and saying by not keeping the focus on gaming it drove away even more of the little audience it had. Had they focused on gaming then things might be different and they could be reaping the rewards that gaming media is going through today. theres lots of things that went wrong and i dont know if they could have held out long enough for it to work as television in general is dying, but there is enough proof that gaming does have an audience from youtube to twitch and had they just focused on gaming then things might of been different."
The Garfield Show,You can never have too much nostalgia.
The Garfield Show,Your arguing solely that animation in the 90s was objectively better than the 60s? Ok
Space Goofs,"People have gotten tribalistic about stupid things and the internet allows them to vent about it anonymously. It's a real issue. Everyone needs a ""take"" about everything."
Space Goofs,"Jesus Christ, do users here love to downvote anything? There is no way that anyone has been able to have already read all I wrote!"
Space Goofs,"I think the world would be a much better place if no one was arrogant. Because arrogance is at the core of why so many people enjoy shitting on other people and what other people love. Art is very subjective. Any individual's emotional connection with an work of art is never gonna be fully explained with logical reasoning. No show will be loved by everyone. No one should be bashed for liking what they like. Art should be as diverse as possible, for the mainstream and for the niche. Including art that is not for me, not for my sensibilites, interests and preferences. Art is worthy if it is able to emotionally touch and move other people, no matter how many or how few people.

If everyone understood all of that, we wouldn't have flame wars, and we wouldn't have people labeling as ""overrated"" what others love. We wouldn't have people being judgmental of others."
Space Goofs,That's why. It's rambling and obviously overanalyzing.
Space Goofs,"> flame wars

Haven't heard that term in sooo long.Trust me,this here is not a flame war,or at least we may have a different knowledge of what it means.


Anyway...this is another reason why you get downvoted.You get too emotional for something that should be fun,and you honestly made me laugh asking in the weekly thread why you get downvoted,and after I refreshed the page you had another downvote.Plus you mentioned it twice...even funnier for some reason.See ? It's the simplest answers.

I got downvoted for asking people what shows they think have a good rewatch value,and I know why : because most likely there was another post similar to that that I haven't seen,and those that saw the older post didn't like a new one.Or maybe they where looking for the same thing as me,and saw that most of the replies where shows that people liked,which wasn't what I asked.A show that you like may not have a great rewatch value,because since you already saw it you know what happens next.Where a show like LOST that I've seen many,many times,still has lots of small details that you can notice."
Space Goofs,"I put so much effort, deep thought and care in this text."
Space Goofs,"I'm passionate about art I love. I don't judge anyone, I want art plurality, I try to be as open-minded and understanding as possible to what other people that I may not, and yet people are still jerks. What did you think of all I wrote in the OP? You'll see why I'm so passionate.

All you talked about are stupid reasons to downvote a post. You just asked for recommendations, you didn't criticize anything, why downvote your post? People are such frustrating jerks."
Space Goofs,"This is Reddit, on a default sub. Deep, well constructed arguments get you nowhere here."
Space Goofs,":(

I'm sad. I worked so hard in my whole argumentation in this post. And I defend so much art plurality, including art that is not for me."
Space Goofs,"I think the thing is that this post is mostly about you: *I, I, I. I this. I that. A lot of people do this and that, but this is what I do. This is how I think… and I’ve prepared several examples!* But no one asked you about you. If you asked *other people* why they are the way they are, and how they think instead of just assuming, and why they think the way they do, instead of telling us how *you* (apparently) already know how so many of us think, and then explaining *so verbosely* how different (and supposedly better) your manner of being and thinking is by contrast (with examples!,) you would get a better response. You seem like a quality person and you are obviously very thoughtful. But it’s your demonstration of regard for others that will earn you the same in return."
Space Goofs,"The problem isn't your writing, it's the forum. People here like digestible fluff and things to argue over but not actually discuss.

It's not you, it's us. Keep on doing you, and hopefully you find a group of like-minded people with whom to have more in-depth discussions."
Space Goofs,"Thanks for the comment. I may be very poor in my argumentation, and I can lose my head and become rude and aggressive in some topics. The fact I'm Asperger also doesn't help. 

Ultimately though, what I'm trying to advocate here is open mind and respect of everyone towards each other. If someone loves and is genuinely and emotionally moved by a piece of art I don't love, who am I to bash that person and invalidate the type of art that person loves? I want art diversity, for all niches and tastes, including art not for me.

Sorry for asking, but I'm Asperger, and terrible with catching sarcasm and/or irony sometimes."
Space Goofs,"For sure, yeah. I think your second paragraph summed up the gist of what that big long original post said. That’s really all you needed to write IMO. Your more detailed thoughts could have been replies to anyone who responded, as appropriate. Additionally I think the problem with specifically talking about ATLA at the same time is you can automatically turn off people who don’t like it, or who don’t know what ATLA is. Plus anyone can look through your post history and see that talking about ATLA can get you worked up, which can be something of a red flag and dissuade positive feedback. A passionate mind is an emotional one. People in strong emotional states tend not to be fully rational or logical. That’s easy to pick up on by most of us and a lot of the time we’ll either avoid those people, or confront those people. In the end your post comes across as written by someone who is passionate about ATLA and wants to evangelize for it by couching the message in a post that purports to be about open-mindedness. I don’t doubt your open-mindedness in general but you don’t necessarily seem open to the minds of people who you think don’t properly appreciate what you like (i.e. ATLA) based off that conversation you linked. Plus (and finally) you used the word “hate,” which honestly you should avoid in the future at all costs. Do not use that word. Anytime you want to use that word, explore and articulate what’s prompting that feeling instead, but never sum it up with that word, ever. It’s a strong word that’s both loaded and empty at the same time, as well as a mental and verbal cop-out that does nothing but admit a sort of intellectual defeat."
Space Goofs,"Yes, sincere. And not necessarily ""better,"" since that is entirely subjective. Just different perspectives and priorities."
Space Goofs,"Oh, I agree about the word ""hate"". I know I'm not a good example, but I think people use it banally.

Thanks for the insightful comment. I personally used ATLA as an example not only because I love it so much, but because I'm specially familiar with the ins and outs of it to argue about."
Space Goofs,"Thanks for the support. Maybe I shouldn't try anymore to post these long essays in this subreddit. It's not the type of subject and discussion that most people really want to have here.

Kids will never have it that good again. What song today could ever reach the quality of the X-men intro?"
Space Goofs,"Yes it was. Well, in actuality the Golden Age is 1991 - 2003.

There are always going to be outliers that make people assume the real dates are some amalgamation of a 20-something year period but I argue those 12 years were the true golden age because it was a constant influx of quality that was bookended by important events. The forming of Cartoon Network to air the cartoons from the original golden age and Nickelodeon airing their first NickToon; all the way until the corporate crash and burn of the early-to-mid 2000s.

Nickelodeon under Warner had been an exclusively kids television channel since 1979; [let's just say it hadn't quite figured things out just yet.] (https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/e/ee/Nicklogoiozzi79.jpg) They were operating at loss with shows they now pretend don't exist anymore. They hired the guys who made MTV iconic to spruce up the Network, [which they accomplished exceptionally well] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYAIX96v1mI) and in 1986 they were sold to Viacom. Under Viacom, Nickelodeon began their rise, first with the original Kid's Choice Awards and then by airing Nick Jr. during school hours. In 1990 they opened the Nickelodeon Studios where they filmed their early sitcoms and game shows and in 1991 Nicktoons began.

Meanwhile, in 1991, Ted Turner bought Hanna-Barbera and created Cartoon Network. The purpose being to air the tape library he had acquired over the years. Along with Hanna-Barbera, he also owned the MGM cartoon library, the Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies shorts, as well as Popeye.

There was now true competition in the world of kids-exclusive television. Money was being pumped into it and most importantly creators were given the freedom to experiment and tell good/great stories and be silly within of course the guidelines of Standards and Practices. John Kricfalusi would discover this the hard way when his popular masterpiece 'Ren and Stimpy' was cancelled for going too far.

Eight years of near perfection. 

Then within a two year period two cataclysmic events happened. Firstly, in 1999 Spongebob Squarepants happened and it was the most popular cartoon ever made and its merchandise alone became omnipresent. Nickelodeon became oddly complacent and out of touch after this. In 2005 Viacom split into two companies marking a definitive end and you can see it in their release line-up.

The second big cataclysmic event was that in 2001, Turner merged with AOL to become AOL TimeWarner which many consider to be the greatest financial blunder in history. Jamie Kellner headed the company and while it seemed reasonable at the time given he was the guy that made Fox a legitimate fourth network and made WB the who's who of cult classic television. However in 2001, Kellner cancelled everything from WCW to Animaniacs to Batman: TAS in favor of shows he wanted to see. Again, this is the guy who is responsible for The Simpsons, Beverly Hills 90210, Married... with Children, Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Gilmore Girls, Dawson's Creek, Charmed and the NFL being on Fox, maybe he knew what he was doing.

In 2003, the AOL TimeWarner experiment had officially crashed and burned. TimeWarner dropped AOL from their name and everything was swept under the carpet. They say that without Turner and his stubbornness (and his finance department working the books) many of his crazy, money losing ideas would have been done away with quickly. Once he was out of the company, that ended up being true. WCW was cancelled immediately. CNN was always sensational but with him gone, [well... yeah] (https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/cnn/). Cartoon Network meanwhile... it was never the same and eventually even started airing non-cartoons.

---
In June 2018, AT&T bought out TimeWarner. As of ~~three~~ two days ago, Turner doesn't even exist.

> On March 4, 2019, AT&T began restructuring WarnerMedia. HBO, TNT, TBS and TruTV were combined into a new entity, WarnerMedia Entertainment.

> WarnerMedia's Otter Media and Turner's Turner Classic Movies, Adult Swim, Cartoon Network and Boomerang became part of Warner Bros. 

> CNN, HLN, Turner Sports, Bleacher Report and AT&T Regional Sports Networks were consolidated under newly-formed WarnerMedia News & Sports.

There will never be another golden age."
Space Goofs,"I dunno. I guess I'm kind of biased being born near the end of that era, but the 2010s had some really good stuff as well, if not, even better. Of course, this is opinion, and you're free to disagree, but we've had:

Adventure Time

Steven Universe

Star Vs the Forces of Evil

Gravity Falls

Over the Garden Wall

Star Wars: The Clone Wars

The Amazing World of Gumball

Not even to mention the adult cartoons Rick and Morty, and Bojack Horseman.

Sure, there is probably less quantity overall, so you could definitely argue against this era, but quite a lot of these shows are just as good, if not even better than a lot of the shows that you listed.

Again, just my opinion."
Space Goofs,"You're wrong, it was (insert decade when I was a kid)."
Space Goofs,I downloaded them and my kids love whatever I show em
Space Goofs,"Naw-1970's man!

HR Pufnstuf-witchipoo, Sigmund the Sea Monster, Electra Woman & Dyna girl, Dr Shrinker, & my personal favorite Land of the Lost"
Space Goofs,"Good times, good times."
Space Goofs,"All those were important shows, but in a way Ren & Stimpy seems to be to be slightly more important - because it specifically brought back the Golden Age style of animation from the 1940s and 1950s. 

Among the current generation of animators, John Kricfalusi is a major influence. "
Space Goofs,"No because then you're missing out on Dragon Ball, Inspector Gadget, Trap Door, M.A.S.K., The Raccoons and many more that were around in the 80s.

I'd say 1984-2002, personally."
Space Goofs,"I think there's been a recent renaissance in serialized children's programming. I honestly would put recent shows like Steven Universe, Adventure Time, Gravity Falls, and others well over the likes of shows that have come before it, and I have watched pretty much every show on this list (though some moreso than others)."
Space Goofs,Every generation thinks what they grew up with were the best.
Space Goofs,Nope totally wrong.  The 80's was the best time to be a kid and we had the best shows
Space Goofs,Cow and Chicken and Dexter's Lab are to me  the Citizen Kane of cartoons.
Space Goofs,"Yes, yes it was"
Space Goofs,Go Speed Racer! Go Speed Racer GO!!!! 
Space Goofs,"Don't forget CN used to show a lot of classic scifi action cartoons from the 70s and 80s in it's early days. Centurions, Plastic Man, Dyno Mutt, Space ghost, Godzilla&son, Thundarr,  Jonny Quest,  Birdman, HongKong Phoeey, Inch High Private Eye... "
Space Goofs,"Pete and Pete, so yes!

By the way, it's not just kids shows.  I don't know if it was 9/11 or what, something just isn't the same anymore."
Space Goofs,"Every generation has great cartoons. But the 1990-2005 generation had both quantity and quality. For example, Nick, not counting Nick Jr., these days only has Spongebob and Loud house on their schedule most of the time."
Space Goofs,How could you forget Clarissa Explains It All and Alex Mac?
Space Goofs,No Darkwing Duck in OP or comments. Fail.
Space Goofs,Anything that had Looney Tunes was the best. However I was very partial to the old Hanna-Barbera cartoons when I was a kid (in the 80s & 90s).
Space Goofs,Where the fuck is Ren and Stimpy?!
Space Goofs,That's a pretty big swath of time though.  
Space Goofs,You forgot Freakazoid!
Space Goofs,what about TMNT 2003?
Space Goofs,"I’d stop it at 2001, but yeah. That era of Cartoon Network is my absolute favourite and it’s really sad to see what it’s turned into."
Space Goofs,"Nah, it was the 80s

Quality over quantity 

Transformers, TMNT, Ducktales, Chip'n Dale Rescue Rangers, Super Mario Bros, Garfield and Friends"
Space Goofs,Obviously 
Space Goofs,"Being in the UK we were lucky and had access to a lot of them through cable TV, and more popular ones shown on regular TV here.

But adding to that list we had Superted, Rupert the Bear, Tintin, Count Duckula and Im sure others would add more greats."
Space Goofs,I loved live and kicking!
Space Goofs,"I mean I'll agree especially since I was born on 1995 so 2000-2005 was really my golden era. 

But it also feels like cheating to include such a large range the world and tv was a much different place in 2005 than it was in 1990. It feels like when people want to say the '90's rocked but keep naming things from the '00's because by the ""'90's"" they really mean ""My childhood"" which I suspect is what is happening here. Give me the perimeters why 1990 is the beginning of this ""Era"" and why 2005 is the end. It would be way more interesting you had this list and had to make a case of the 1990's vs the 2000's"
Space Goofs,Because people were actually creative.
Space Goofs,"No

Most of them didnt last more than 2 seasons.


Try looking at the era between 1976-1989,the era before cable TV dominance."
Space Goofs,"Most likely. There was more passion and creativity in those days IMHO. Not sure what the content looks like now, but there is the occasional sleeper every now and then. For me it was 1990-2002 for smart entertainment aimed at young people with some added subversive jokes for adults. Spongebob, Pete and Pete, Hey Arnold, Rockos Modern Life, and Gravity Falls come to mind. Most likely there are clever shows that exist now, but that period of time for me and you will always remain very special."
Space Goofs,You can stop at 2000 and throw in 1989
Space Goofs,I would say the 90s. Nothing past 2000 was any good.
Space Goofs,"I would say yes. 06 and 07 had some pretty good ones too though, like :-

Shuriken School


Emperor's New School


George of the Jungle


Team Galaxy
"
Space Goofs,Best black super hero
Space Goofs,Dope af.
Space Goofs,"The question is essentially ""is my nostalgia the best nostalgia?""

Also, intentionally casting a wide net by the range of years and *also* throwing in the reruns is guaranteed to net some strong agreement/karma.

And it's literally just a list of shows to get people to reminisce. There is nothing in the OP that is trying to spark a discussion about *what* may have made those shows great, or how they might be different from shows today.

It's a nostalgia/agreement/karma fishing expedition.

I think I'll unsub..."
Space Goofs,Wrong. I see many of todays kids say that the original Teen Titans is better than Teen Titans Go.
Space Goofs,"I forgot to put KaBlam! It was a good show, super funny.  Superman on the other hand was okay, it was one of the weakest DCAU shows"
Space Goofs,And The Adventures of Gummi Bears
Space Goofs,"The '80s were great. I loved watching USA Cartoon Express as a young child. I caught the tail end of that generation of Saturday morning cartoons in the late '80s/early '90s. 

I grew out of cartoons by the early 2000s so I can't really speak for anything after 2002-2003."
Space Goofs,[deleted]
Space Goofs,"No the 80s was absolutely terrible except for a few late 80s/early 90s shows like DuckTales

Cartoons like GI Joe  and Transformers were basically toy ads and not the good type of toy ads like The Lego Movie"
Space Goofs,"Personally I wouldn't. Most of what came out after 2005 was a notable moon jump in quality away from what came out in the 15 years prior.

Now, I enjoyed Ben10 for what it was and it was fine. Avatar: The Last Airbender debuted in 2005 but I'm willing to not count it as it was right on the border. However Avatar is transcendent and the exception. Hell, it might have been the only great kids show to debut in that post-boom era. Not even Legend of Korra was in the same league (thanks Nickelodeon!)

While I have no love for Naruto, it technically debuted in 2002 and is also Japanese. If we want to talk about Japan, you'll looking at 1980 - 1995 for their Golden Age with a few outliers before and after. Personally I'm not a fan of OP using Toonami as an example given that shows like Dragon Ball were in the realms of 20 years old before we got them.

Point stands that yes, 1990 - 2005 is the golden age of kids shows (in the West)."
Space Goofs,This is an incredibly informative and interesting reply. Calling it now- it'll be bestof'd within 24 hours.
Space Goofs,"I mean I’d argue there was a short “light in the dark” period between 2009-13. Adventure Time was the first in a new generation of innovative cartoons, everything from Gravity Falls to Steven Universe to Regular Show to The Amazing World of Gumball... like these shows are all widely enjoyed and critically acclaimed, so we can’t deny their impact. Though there haven’t been any true heavy-hitters for a while I’d say, apart from a handful since the networks aren’t putting their faith in new cartoons as much, unlike how they were with Adventure Time fever. But you are right, it’s not an overwhelmingly solid period of time like the first “golden age” (which had its real stinkers, but like I said, overwhelmingly solid) and more like a group of intelligent, innovative people got given a chance and a platform for once, and that small number of shows was the product"
Space Goofs,"I'm probably op age and I agree with this. I think shows today have more depth and I enjoy them a lot. I would add Hilda, Avatar, Korra, Chowder and Flapjack too. Right now they seem to go for quality over quantity."
Space Goofs,from where? I want to download old toons
Space Goofs,"Issue is that the three shows you mentioned pretty much capture the entire true renaissance though... and that’s literally 4 years. There’s definitely been an uptake in quality over the last decade and with regards to animation the 10s aren’t exactly something to sneeze at for sure. But the very best came out within the first three years, like a dozen exceptions all at once: which, I know, sounds like an oxymoron but over the rest of the decade I can count maybe five more shows that carry any sort of weight, and those five have either been subject to major scheduling abuse and thus have very few episodes or just haven’t been out for a while and thus have very few episodes, so I just can’t call it a trend. "
Space Goofs,Bucky O'Hare. Philleas Fogg. Bananaman. Henry's Cat.
Space Goofs,We also got to watch The Raccoons and The Moomins too and The Animals of Farthing Wood on CBBC too.
Space Goofs,"1990 is the beggining of this era because this is when cartoons such as The Simpsons, Batman TAS (which are regarded as two of the best cartoons ever made) X-men, etc came out. These shows pushed the boundaries of what a cartoon could be. The animation, writing, direction, and quality improved drastically upon cartoons of previous years.

And i put down 2005 as the end of this era because the cartoon landscape changed drastically in the mid- 2000s. Nickelodeon shows such Rocket Power, CatDog, Rugrats, Hey Arnold, Wild Thornberrys all ended in 04-05. The Spongebob Movie also came out in November 2004 and everyone agrees that the best era of Spongebob was everything before the movie. On Cartoon Network shows such as Powerpuff Girls, Johnny Bravo, Samurai Jack, Teen Titans, Justice League all ended in the mid 2000s. Toonami was also moved to one day a week during this time.

Also, by the mid 2000s Fox Kids was defunct and Kids WB was a shell of its former self and on its way out. 

I'm pretty sure this answered your question."
Space Goofs,"Okay say what you will about recent cartoons but let’s not pretend that creativity has been the issue for this decade. Gravity Falls, Over the Garden Wall, The Amazing World of Gumball, Regular Show, The Legend of Korra, Hilda, Star vs the Forces of Evil, The Dragon Prince, Steven Universe, OK KO, Wander Over Yonder, Milo Murphy’s Law, Uncle Grandpa, and ***Adventure Time*** for Christ’s sake. The list could go on. Say what you will, but creativity is *not* an issue for those shows. "
Space Goofs,And a mix of 1984 & 85
Space Goofs,"Ahh yes, the 2000s, known for such unwatchable trash as SpongeBob SquarePants and Avatar the last Airbender."
Space Goofs,"While this is true, we're also getting many great kid cartoons too. The Amazing World of Gumball, Gravity Falls, The Legend of Korra, Star vs. the Forces of Evil, and probably more are recent examples of great kid shows. The 90's-early 2000's had their share of stickers too, including awful reboots."
Space Goofs,"Well that disproves their whole argument.

Move along, people."
Space Goofs,It gave us one of the best video games ever produced - Superman on Nintendo 64.
Space Goofs,"i'm guessing: ""and a ton of other shows if I did 10 min of research"""
Space Goofs,Well it worked because those toys were freaking awesome!
Space Goofs,Your being brain washed
Space Goofs,How'd you find this thread from 3 years ago?
Space Goofs,Oh yeah. Raccoons on a Sat morning before Superman then Live amd Kicking.
Space Goofs,It's not creavity the artstyle is the same and gets boring after 2000s anyone could realise this happening
Space Goofs,Is that when M.A.S.K came out?
Space Goofs,Space Adventure Cobra. Best cartoon ever.
Space Goofs,Get out. 
Space Goofs,Exactly. Not an end all be all list. Loved Inspector Gadget.   
Space Goofs,"I was getting nostalgic and wanted to compile a list of 2000s shows that I used to watch and download it later, searched something like ""popular 90s/2000s tv shows"" and here I am"
The Missing,"I thought the show was interesting, but not nearly as good as the other two shows mentioned here."
The Missing,[deleted]
The Missing,I've been watching this... it's just Defending the Guilty but in a bank and with sex.
The Missing,"
>reality be damned! 

I was under the impression this show was fiction"
The Missing,What did you just call me?!
The Missing,Damn I thought this was a new season of the UK show
The Missing,"Of course, let's use the same title as other series. Besides nothing can beat Baptiste."
The Missing,Most underrated show ever! Season 1 was perfect
The Missing,"S1 of Baptiste was so so but S2 was really good (I think, it’s been a while)"
The Missing,I loved on better things when Pamela Hayden kept getting confused for Constance Zimmer
The Missing,"Since the scene has been missing from previous airings of the special on CBS for many years (and some DVD releases) besides it's original airing on NBC during it's first couple of years. FreeForm (Formerly ABC Family/Fox Family) was able to bring back this scene in 2019 as part of their ""25 Days of Christmas"" that runs throughout December until Christmas Day. 

This scene along with Santa arriving at The Island Of Misfit Toys were both played in the same airings instead of being separate. Which CBS hasn't been doing with their airings along with shortening ""We're A Couple Of Misfits"" and ""We Are Santa's Elves"" while FreeForm kept those sequences in their original form.

Looks like I will stick with FreeForm for now on (until the special moves from CBS to NBC in the future and retains those scenes) in order to experience the special as it was originally intended. No more worrying about sped up song sequences. But I do miss hearing Bumble's roar as Rudolph is leaving by himself while Hermey and Yukon are staying at the Island Of Misfit Toys for the night before the commercial break that CBS still has. Same with Sam The Snowman using his umbrella to hide from a blizzard after talking about Bumble."
The Missing,Fun fact:  That incredible snow effect was by far the easiest animation done in this classic.  Everything else is stop motion photography.  After that incredibly intensive work is done... they simply scratch out bits of each frame.  Put those scratches all together and wa-lah you have a snow storm.
The Missing,Yukon Fraking Cornelius. YES.
The Missing,"This was my favorite Christmas special as a kid, and I still love it.  It contained a message about the positives in being different that meant a lot to me. I never learned until much later in life that Rudolph’s story came from Montgomery Wards!"
The Missing,"Since CBS has started to shorten the length of this special in recent years. I would seriously recommend watching this on FreeForm this Christmas and hopefully in the next couple of years. FreeForm kept the special in it's original form. Especially since CBS has started shortening the songs (mainly ""We Are Santa's Elves"" and ""We're A Couple of Misfits"").

The only thing missing is Bumble's roar as Rudolph is leaving The Island Of Misfit Toys and Hermey and Yukon in fear of his nose causing more harm with his friends."
The Missing,I was expecting a peppermint landmine
The Missing,"Wish I knew it was ""missing"" as I am 99% certain I have the vhs in my box of christmas decorations."
The Missing,I remember this part. I wonder where i saw it. CBC I assume.
The Missing,It's a fun little scene but Yukon was looking for gold and silver the whole time.  Now he's stoked for peppermint?  Sort of a weird twist.
The Missing,"> **was able to restore**

Meaning what.  They did a Ctrl-V?  Nice job."
The Missing,You'd probably benefit from buying a copy of it.
The Missing,"By saying they “restored” it, you make it seem like it was damaged footage or something."
The Missing,"I always loved the snow effects in this special more than later Rankin/Bass stop motion Christmas specials. The effects in this special felt more convincing.

I'm also glad we get to finally see Clarice and Donner's closing remarks."
The Missing,Voila or voilà.
The Missing,"Yukon along with Clarice, and The Head Elf are hands down my favorite characters of the special besides Rudolph himself.

 I wish Clarice's song ""There's Always Tomorrow"" could get played on radio during the Christmas season. It's such a beautiful and touching song. That song along with ""Silver And Gold"" are my favorite songs from that special."
The Missing,I actually remember reading the original 1939 book that my town library and school library had. Rudolph had a much cuter appearance.
The Missing,Gotta make more space for God Friended Me ads somehow
The Missing,It was on some VHS releases.
The Missing,Im going to check my VHS later this weekend for this scene. I have the Broadway Video version.
The Missing,"Oh for sure!  I watched these effects on a 25"" 'large screen' TV in the early '80s for the first time and will never forget that pure joy and genuine wonderment."
The Missing,R/boneappletea
The Missing,[deleted]
The Missing,"Couldn't tell if OP was doing it intentionally as an onomatopoeia, or if it was just stupidity..."
The Missing,[deleted]
The Missing,"*Silver And Gold decorations*

*On every Christmas tree*

I cherish this special so much!"
The Missing,I didn’t see that book until I was an adult. It was adorable!
The Missing,I never had the VHS
The Missing,"Speaking of effects, I always loved the sound of wind blowing during scenes where it's set in a snowstorm/blizzard. It's one of those moments that stick with you as a child. Especially when viewing them at nighttime which really sets the mood."
The Missing,"Frame it how you like, but it's the illiterate version."
The Missing,"Well, the ""v"" should be pronounced."
The Missing,You are not.
The Missing,You might like /r/boneappletea
The Missing,https://youtu.be/_n5E7feJHw0
The Missing,You should check out Max Fleischer's adaptation from 1948. Rudolph's appearance is so sweet and charming.
The Missing,"Maybe it did air in other countries since you said you lived in Canada. A lot of things that are either censored or not seen often in the US tend to air overseas. For instance, the cartoon Animaniacs had two examples: the original cut of Broadcast Nuisance airing in Australia and Teletoon Retro in Canada airing Potty Emergency with an alternate take of the scene where a man waters the grass (with the nozzle facing a different direction)."
The Missing,I can hear it now!
The Missing,[deleted]
The Missing,"‘Tis the season to happily do so, right?! 😄"
The Missing,"I'm sure it's just me misreading it, but I want to make sure you know that there is no sea between the US and Canada."
The Missing,"Well I guess you should tell that to French choclotier Jacques Torres, because he pronounces it with a v. 

Also I misspelled choclotier and Firefox suggested ""echolocation"" was the word I meant."
The Missing,"> choclotier 

Well, I'm on a roll, so ""chocolatier."""
The Missing,"Apparently nothing to do with the British show The Missing or Baptiste, which are pretty good."
The Missing,PBS(BBC One) had a followup called Baptiste with a 2nd season for that. Really good!
The Missing,Almost forgot about this gem. Season 2 is my favorite... almost like a whole different series.
The Missing,"Personally - that ending for S1 is going to haunt me for a long time, so it takes the cake out of the two. 

Haven't seen Baptiste yet. Glad to see Tchéky Karyo working! I really missed that guy in this millennium."
The Missing,"[***Baptiste***](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qy2rNq3vwX8) *S1* was the 3rd season of *The Missing.*  PBS had it on Masterpiece in the US and it's available for streaming [on PBS Passport](https://www.pbs.org/show/baptiste/).  And the [BBC has commissioned a second season](https://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/latestnews/2020/baptiste). I do think, however, along with you, that S2 of *The Missing* was the strongest season of the entire run so far.  I also think it was partially based on the Fritzl case, like the movie/novel of *Room* was.

If you like *The Missing,* I highly recommend finding the other crime thrillers by Harry and Jack Williams. They all have a scandi-noir feel, and are mostly told out of chronological order. However, in the US, their stuff is scattered all over the place; UK viewers just need the Beeb and ITV. :)

Sundance/AMC+ has [***Liar***](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62jHH3GIVCs)*.* \[ITV\]

Cinemax has [***Rellik***](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWnotKVwmpk) \[BBC One\]. (This one doesn't just leap about in time, it goes *backwards*).

Amazon Prime has [***The Widow***](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB8KzGSZ40M) \[ITV\]*.*

Netflix also has the BBC One show, [*One of Us*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H5UFSUPQZ34) \[UK title\]/[***Retribution***](https://www.netflix.com/title/80141960) \[US Netflix title\], but it's not at the same level of writing as the others.

They also have two upcoming series, [*Angela Black*](https://deadline.com/2020/10/angela-black-spectrum-originals-itv-team-for-joanne-froggatt-thriller-1234593514/) (ITV/Spectrum) and [*The Tourist*](https://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/latestnews/2020/the-tourist) (BBC).

They also own [Two Brothers Pictures](https://www.twobrotherspictures.com/), which produced *Fleabag*"
The Missing,"The Missing first season was a kick in the gut and very good.  I never saw the second season. 

I started to watch Baptist which is a continuation of the Baptiste character and I did about three episodes and quit. Baptiste stars Tchéky Karyo (obviously) and he is just excellent. He is such a great actor. It also stars Tom Hollander who is also such a great actor.

I did about three episodes and found the whole thing a dull contrived mess and never finished."
The Missing,"I dunno, season 1 of The Missing was about the best season of TV ever."
The Missing,Completely agree. Great watch and loved Baptiste too
The Missing,IMHO A lot of British shows leave a little to be desired but this is one of the shows that I rank at the top. There aren't many British shows where I'm super excited to see the next episode.
The Missing,Fuck yeah Julien Baptiste
The Missing,So stoked for this. Baptiste was the best part of The Missing series!
The Missing,"I liked ''The missing'' show, mainly because how awesome Baptiste character was when it comes to the story and great acting."
The Missing,Tom Hollander is always worth watching
The Missing,So does that mean the missing is done? I thought the second season was pretty good.
The Missing,Yes!!! (haven't watched this yet but assuming it will be amazing)
The Missing,one of my favourite TV detectives...excellent...
The Missing,Do I need to have watched the missing to watch this?
The Missing,"My mom just finished watching season 1 of The Missing this morning, so this is amazing timing."
The Missing,American. Do we know if this is going to make its way into Starz like The Missing?  
The Missing,He’s from Birdbix
The Missing,Love him. So engaging <3
The Missing,"That was a dang nice trailer. Hopefully this will come to the states quickly, I kind of dread the constant wait for all the excellent British crime shows to come over to our side of the Atlantic. 

Def check out ""the missing"". It's on Amazon (for Americans at least), excellent acting and visuals, and uses time as a narrative tool in some really clever ways that I dunno if I can explain in a post like this quickly. "
The Missing,With the brain surgery and impaired gait he sort of reminds me of Columbo.  The best part is that the plot is really going in different places than expected.
The Missing,Netflix was supposed to show Baptiste (labeled as The Missing Season 3) starting on June 17th but it's not available for me...will this be shown in the USA or is it exclusive to the UK?
The Missing,"It hasn't been renewed for a 3rd season yet, but the writers (who are the same writers for Baptiste) said that they are open for another season, but that it would be a whole new story and would not feature Baptiste."
The Missing,"Yup pretty much. *Baptiste* is what the Williams Brothers are doing instead.  Well, that and [*Rellik*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M7OMB1Nd4g0) and [*The Widow.*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB8KzGSZ40M)"
The Missing,watched it. just gonna go ahead and say this will be my favorite show of 2019.
The Missing,shoutout to Harry Bosch
The Missing,"Probably not. I'm sure theres going to be references for those of us that have watched the other seasons. But, you're really missing out on some incredibly tense and addictive tv if you haven't watched the Missing. IMO."
The Missing,each season of the missing was anthology style focusing on a missing child case with Detective Baptiste being the investigator. You could've watched s2 without watching s1 or watched the seasons in reverse order so the spin-off can probably very easily be watched without having previously watched The Missing.
The Missing,"You'd probably be fine, but the missing is some excellent television so you might want to check it out beforehand regardless just so that you can grow to love the character of Batiste like we all have. "
The Missing,"Not yet.  We do know that Amazon Prime has picked up [*The Widow*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB8KzGSZ40M)*,* which is also done by Harry and Jack Williams (drops March 1). Cinemax, btw, picked up their other non-linear-told show, [*Rellik*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M7OMB1Nd4g0)*.*"
The Missing,"Rumor is, it drops on Netflix, titled, *The Missing: Season 3*, [on 17th June](https://www.polygon.com/2019/5/22/18635583/netflix-june-2019-movies-tv-shows)."
The Missing,He's character was annoying in Birdbox and his character in Baptiste is just as annoying 
The Missing,"I really liked the France/UK aspect of the show, I could see how that may not be easy to keep up story wise but it's really cool to have shows across two countries. The tunnel is another one that was pretty good but ended last year."
The Missing,Where watch?
The Missing,"Good to know, although of course I don’t have access to either platform at this time. "
The Missing,">The tunnel is another one that was pretty good but ended last year.

Yeah, but the Scandinavian original, *Bron|Broen (The Bridge),* was better.  They ended, last year, too, though, with their final fourth season. I think it kind of started the whole cross-border thriller trend. :)"
The Missing,"In the US, you can find it on [Starz](https://www.starz.com/loginstart/22389) and [Amazon Prime](https://www.amazon.com/gp/video/detail/B01MUZPVHH/). "
The Missing,julian baptiste is probably one of my favourite detectives on TV.
The Missing,"This and Unforgotten.
The Brits do mystery and drama very well."
The Missing,"Season 2 is alright, it doesn't really live up to the hype to the first season but its still very enjoyable. Also Baptiste (which is the spin off of The Missing) is pretty good. I saw the first 2 episodes, but became a bit lazy and didn't finish it."
The Missing,"I loved Season 2 as well, but possibly because I'd been watching *Room* and knew about the real-life case behind it, which clearly influenced the Williams Brothers as well. I think it's less well known in the US, primarily because it was initially broadcast on the cable premium network, Starz, which, like Epix, most people doesn't even know exists and certainly don't class along with HBO.  And who the hell can find anything on Amazon Prime. :/  Similar to how nobody knows about *Rellik.*

I've been following Harry and Jack Williams as a writing/showrunning duo since *The Missing,* and there's actually a lot of stuff available, but you've probably missed most of it, because while in the UK, you only need BBC and ITV to catch it all, here in the US, it's all over the damn place. I'm a dinosaur who still has cable, so it's been easier for me to find. All their series are crime dramas, most have some cross-border elements, and I believe all of them are told in non-linear order. They are:

* *The Missing* (BBC, Amazon Prime, Starz). You know this one. :D
* [*One of Us*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H5UFSUPQZ34) (UK title on BBC)/*Retribution* ([Netflix title](https://www.netflix.com/title/80141960)). Brutal murder of a couple in the Scottish highlands.

BTW, their production company, Two Brothers Pictures, also produced *Fleabag.*"
The Missing,"It's still going on, but now it's just called *Baptiste*.

I watch it every year, I absolutely love Julien Baptiste, he's such a great character."
The Missing,Is this the one where the guy’s brother goes missing?
The Missing,Right?! I think he's the main reason I liked the show so much
The Missing,I'll have to check out Unforgotten
The Missing,Nice! I just saw something about Baptiste. Will have to check it out
The Missing,Sweet thanks for the info! I've seen The Widow on Amazon and been thinking of checking it out
Stoked,"We have run out of time but want to thank everybody who has watched and enjoyed the show from the bottom of our hearts. Thank you for your questions, sorry we couldn't answer them all and we sincerely hope we'll see you back at Portland Row before too long. 

Joe, Ruby, Cameron and Ali. x"
Stoked,"Question for Cameron, Ruby, and Ali: what was your favorite line of dialogue to deliver in season 1?"
Stoked,Were you allowed to write on or make additions to the thinking cloth?
Stoked,"Question for Joe, I don't suppose there's any chance we ever get a proper release of the complete The Adam and Joe Show on Blu-ray is there?"
Stoked,To all: is there any footage of the milk gate? It’s been described as the funniest moment on set and fans (me) are curious to see
Stoked,"Hi!! Thank you so much for taking time to talk and share with us!! What an incredible adaptation you've gifted us.

For Joe: What was the most difficult and/or rewarding part of the development/pre-pro process for this series?

For Ruby: I saw that you’ve done trapeze! (I’m an aerialist too, with a preference for trapeze/lyra). Have you trained in any other apparatuses? Non-spoiler thoughts on *That* scene in The Empty Grave?

For Ali: Your George has earned such a special place in my heart, thank you for taking such great care of him! What are some of your favorite qualities of George? Any you can relate to?

For Cameron: It's like you walked off straight from the pages as Anthony Lockwood, and we're so grateful. What is your process like for getting into character?

General: Cast birthdays? (For astrological sign reasons 👀)"
Stoked,"To the cast & Joe: I've rewatched the show more than 5 times already, if you don't get the greenlight from Netflix for a second season what's the possibility of you switching streaming services? Just asking on behalf of the fandom, we're desperate for more from our absolute favourite cast ever <3"
Stoked,"Question for Cameron: Having just come out of drama school what were you expecting when it came to getting actual roles? Were you confident in your ability to get a role in this industry or were you like so many other actors unsure of your success?  

Note : You're incredibly talented thank you for gracing our screen with your presence we will forever be in your debt"
Stoked,"Brilliant adaptation of an excellent series of books. My Q is directed at Cameron, Ruby and Ali:

Q - what do you imagine Lockwood, Lucy and George would do for a living/hobbies when they hit 20 ish and their ability to see ghosts starts to fade?"
Stoked,For Cameron: the books often mention Lockwood's iconic coat being too long and getting in the way. Did you ever have any problems like that on set?
Stoked,"As someone who is very conscious of sharp metal objects in close proximity, I get mini heart attacks whenever I see Lockwood or Lucy draw swords within inches of someone standing nearby, or when one of your rapiers stick out behind looking ready to trip someone. 

I'm curious, did anyone ever got hurt on set by the rapiers? Or accidentally poked by your fellow mates?"
Stoked,"Hey Joe! Was it written in the script to change Lockwood’s usual pink socks to blue during the party scene to match with Lucy, or was that just an unhinged (in an amazing way) decision by the costume designers?

Show is amazing!!"
Stoked,"If the problem finally went away or gifts faded and Lockwood and Co couldn’t be agents, what do you think each character would do for a job?"
Stoked,"My question is for whoever wants to answer it, maybe Cameron! I just wanted to know if Lockwood's dark eyebags were all natural or done with makeup? ;)"
Stoked,"for Ruby! - 

your northern accent slayed, were you confident going in or did you have a voice coach?"
Stoked,"Have you guys read the books and if so what was your favorite? If we get another season are there any particular scenes you are looking forward to filming? Thanks so much for the great adaption, me and my brother loved it."
Stoked,Why hasn't Netflix been promoting the show at all? It is truly a hidden gem and deserves more promotion and recognition.
Stoked,"This is a wonderful opportunity! Can't thank you enough for it!!

For Joe; How is the process of getting books adapted into a show? I really want to get into the field as a screenwriter/director hopefully, so I was wondering if you also had any advice for someone who has no idea what they're doing 😂

For Ali; I'm so so excited about your character!! I'm Persian myself, so the second I saw your name I was like...can it be? And then you mention ghormeh sabzi and nan khameii and I instantly felt at home. I absolutely love the changes to your character because I've always wanted to see my own culture in a character. And my question is; will there be more cultural exploration for George? Maybe even a nod to kolah Ghermezi (I hope you do know what I'm talking about 😂) 

For Cameron; What's something you love about playing your character? And what's the most challenging part about it? Absolutely love your performance btw!

For Ruby; What are some aspects of your character that you're excited to explore and try to act out? Lucy is such a complex character so mad respect for nailing her character!!"
Stoked,Question for Ali: are we going to be seeing more Franklin in future seasons?
Stoked,"Question for Cameron. 
Do you see any similarities with you and Lockwood?"
Stoked,"Hi!! Thank you for the amazing work that you've done in bringing some of my favorite characters and stories to life. Question for Joe: Is there a scene from the books that you really wish you'd have kept in the series, but weren't able to? For Cameron, Ruby, and Ali: What was the most difficult scene(s) to shoot?"
Stoked,"This is amazing!

Question for Cameron, Ruby & Ali: which scene you cherish the most shooting?"
Stoked,"to all three of you, how have your friends reacted to your breakthroughs as these iconic characters in a Netflix show that is sure to go down as iconic?"
Stoked,Question for everyone: what do you think is the musical taste of each of the main three?  And how do you think the Problem affected the musical industry?
Stoked,"Not show related, but for Ali: being that you're a lit student, do you have a favorite book and/or author?!?!"
Stoked,"for ruby, cameron and ali: any behind the scenes stories/pranks played/moments?"
Stoked,"Which of the trio would win an intense game of Monopoly- Lucy, Lockwood or George? 😂👀"
Stoked,for joe! what's a scene from one of the other 3 books do you look forward  to adapting
Stoked,[deleted]
Stoked,"Hey Joe!

Love this show, 2 questions if you don't mind:

&#x200B;

1. What is your creative process when it comes to building characters and a story? Lockwood and Co was so brilliantly well done and I'd love to learn about your process. Hopefully, the script get's released one day as well :) 
2. How did this show come to be? Were you approached by the author or were you a fan of the books?  It's so rare to find a book-to-show adaptation that was done so well. Would love to hear the story.

&#x200B;

Looking forward to Season 2!"
Stoked,"for everyone - There was a lot of iconic london filming locations this season, what other ones would you want to film at in another season?"
Stoked,"Hello! This show definitely has a special place in my heart!

My first question is, what can we do on our part to help and ensure the show gets renewed for a second season (besides (re) watching) ?

Second of all, is there some kind of significance to Lockwood's pink socks? What made you make that decision?"
Stoked,"Not a question, just a comment, Cam, Ruby and Ali's voices are so soothing. They could honestly record an audiobook and I would buy it.  Lovely trio!"
Stoked,"Lockwood and Lucy's relationship is more obvious to the viewer than it is to the reader since the book is from Lucy's point of view, so now we get to see Lockwood's side as well.

My question is, when do you think was the moment Lockwood started to have feelings for Lucy?"
Stoked,"To Ruby, Cameron and Ali: 

You guys have mentioned you've seen a few fan-made edits on the show with songs the fandom associates with the characters playing in the background, what songs/music/genres/artists would YOU guys associate with your characters (after all, you know them better than we could ever!)"
Stoked,To Cameron: How does it feel to be a heartthrob??
Stoked,"If the characters at Portland Row were to get a house pet, what kind of pet would it be?"
Stoked,"To Cameron, Ali and Ruby: Assuming all three of you have read all the books, how do you feel about the character of Holly and are you (if at all) anticipating the introduction of this new member of your little family?"
Stoked,"I just finished watching the show yesterday.  I absolutely loved it.  I think my favorite thing about the show was that the young adults acted like mature young adults rather than immature/soap opera-esque teenagers.  The three lead actors were incredible, and I never felt like I was watching a “show for kids”.  


As the show creator can you talk about creating this more mature/serious tone? 


For the actors (you guys were amazing-truly blown away), can you talk about your approach to the characters and finding the balance between portraying teenagers but keeping with the more mature tone?  

(Bonus question was it fun using/carrying the swords?  Did you do any training?)"
Stoked,"hello, my name is mel, i'm 19, i was a HUGE fan of the book series when i was younger and the netflix show means a great deal to me. thanks so much for taking the time to do this!!

joe: are there any scenes you wish you could've put in the show, but were unable to for any reason? and were there any scenes that you instantly knew you couldn't wait to film?

cameron: as this is your first role, how was your first experience as an actor in a big netflix show like this? and do you have any advice for someone like me who'd like to go into the film industry?

ruby: do you have any of your own little 'headcanons' about lucy - like, any little extra traits that you've given her along the course of you playing her?

ali: how easy was it for you to connect to george as a character, and do you see any similarities and differences between you and him? p.s. i am autistic and i see a lot of myself in george, so thank you so much for bringing this wonderful portrayal of him to the screen!!

all of the characters are so perfect and i genuinely think this is my favourite book to screen adaptation i've ever seen. it stays true to the books, and still manages to put its own special little twist on it, and i really couldn't imagine a better adaptation! thank you so much ❤️"
Stoked,Kinda curious what prop/costume/set piece etc from the show are you all most attached to? And may perhaps take home? Lol
Stoked,When will season 2 be announced? We're on the edge of our seats! Just give us a hint or something
Stoked,"for cameron and ruby: did you expect there to be a separate fanbase for ‘locklyle’ shippers while you were filming, or has it caught you by surprise?"
Stoked,"Question for Cameron, Ruby & Ali: Which scene was the most emotional to film?"
Stoked,"Hello everyone! Thank you for taking your time to answer some of our burning questions! The show was absolutely amazing. It gave me chills, smiles, and tears, and it certainly was true to the books! Every detail was immeasurably impressive and the writing and acting was marvelous! Really hoping for a season two! It’d make my year!

Now, for questions!

* There were some tough and emotional scenes throughout the series. In what ways did you prepare and what was your thought process when it came to these scenes? ( Did you consider the character’s past? Did you think of something sad? Etc.) In this instance for Joe, what made you decide to write these scenes?
* What moment from the books do you wish would have made it on screen?
* Which of the characters do you relate to the most?
* Which episode did you enjoy filming / writing the most and why? Your least favorite episode writing / filming?
* If the trio weren’t having to deal with cyclical missions and ghosts and were to live a normal life, what would do you think they’d be doing?"
Stoked,"For Ruby, Cameron and Ali are there certain techniques of acting you used to prepare yourself? And is it different reading the books when preparing to a role, do you pay attention to certain details?

And thank you so so much for portraying this characters so perfectly! Must have been hard work also which is much appreciated."
Stoked,Question for everyone: how does it feel bring the leads in such a great show?
Stoked,"Loved the show. 
How is it filming with different directors? The show felt consistent, but with different people at the helm it would be easy to see how things could get complicated. Unlike with a movie where usually there's one director leading."
Stoked,"I loved the show, and genuinely believe it’s one of the best book to screen adaptations out there. The character-focused storytelling is brilliantly written and acted wonderfully. Here’s my questions: 

For Joe Cornish: When writing this script, since it’s based on books, were there any challenges in adapting the source material, and any really fun aspects? 
 
For the cast: How did you prepare to take on these roles? Is there anything you do to help get into character?"
Stoked,"thank you for bringing the series to life in such a beautiful way! this is a question for everyone: if *you* (the actors and joe) were in Stroud's London, do you think you'd be agents? relic men? or something else?"
Stoked,for ruby and cameron: how would you describe locklyle?
Stoked,for everyone: what career or path do you think your characters would follow in a world without The Problem?
Stoked,"Question for Ruby: What was it like stepping into this relatively unheard of and new franchise, having no idea as to where it would head (its popularity etc) from something as big as Bridgerton, and what about the Lockwood and Co world appealed to you?"
Stoked,For Ruby: What do you think of Lucy's shades of blue wardrobe color? Do you think it matches her character?
Stoked,question for ruby: whats a trait about lucy that you can relate to?
Stoked,"Hi Joe! Huge fan of your work, love love love the Kid Who Would Be King and am really enjoying Lockwood & Co. 

I love how your work always balances a fantastical element with a grounded universe, while still doing a fair bit of world building. I'm wondering how you approach that kind of world building and how you find that balance?

An optional second question! I deeply admire your ability to write stories about kids that don't talk down to them, and are appealing to adults as well. I'd love to know what drives you to write such engaging stories about kids - is that a conscious choice? And how do you approach creating engaging kid characters?

......and will we ever see another Tintin movie?!?!!?"
Stoked,"Love this, love the show! It was wonderful to see Lucy, Lockwood and George come to life in this amazing book adaptation. I would really love a season 2!  
Question for Ruby, Cameron and Ali: What personality trait of your character did you struggle with the most during rehearsal/filming?"
Stoked,"Do Joe: Did you have a say in the soundtrack of the show because the songs picked were perfect for the show, a big thank you to whoever selected the soundtrack!"
Stoked,"Joe! I've been such an admirer of your work and am a young producer who also loves this genre and space! Thank you for this incredible adaptation and for the thoughtfulness and love that so clearly went into every detail of this show!

You're often known for discovering and working with young talent and I was wondering if you could talk more about how you foster and support them on set/throughout production. What are some things thoughtful producers and creators should think about that help create an environment for young or newer talent to grow and offer their best work?

And secondly I really appreciated how much you involved Jonathan in an adaptation like this, down to what I read somewhere was having him and Ali consult on George's new last name or even some of the details on set or the Thinking Cloth. I find it unfortunately rare that creators are so collaborative with authors of IP being adapted and wondered how you figured out how to strike the right balance?"
Stoked,"Hello everyone! Being especially fond of the swordfights, I want to ask to Ruby, Cameron and Ali: did you enjoy learning to use your rapiers? Was it physically demanding?

Thank you everyone for your time!"
Stoked,"question for ali,ruby and cameron:what was the moment when you laugh the most while you were filming the scene?"
Stoked,"Hello, by any chance, do you take interns?"
Stoked,Do you guys have nicknames for each other?
Stoked,"hii! what would be on lockwood, lucy and george's shared playlist for their ghosthunting trips?"
Stoked,"for the cast - what's one actor that you didn't share many scenes with in the show, but that you wish your character would've interacted with more?"
Stoked,what were first and last shootings?
Stoked,"were there any scenes that got cut out of final versions of episodes? if yes, could you tell more?"
Stoked,question for all of you: which book is your favourite out of L&Co series? (if spoilers are not allowed just say which one out of 5)
Stoked,"I just want to show my appreciation for such a wonderful adaptation of one of my favourite book series! I binged all the episodes in a day which shows how much I enjoyed it.

Okay, maybe a quick question for our rising young stars. How do you see yourselves in 5 years time and if there's anything you wish to challenge yourself in other than acting (for example directing, writing, producing etc... Maybe Joe could be your mentor? Haha)? And also if there's any other or specific film genres you wish to play a role in the future?"
Stoked,"Question for Ali, Ruby, and Cameron: in the case that Netflix does approve for more seasons, what book are you looking forward to adapting?"
Stoked,"on some of bts photos there were dogs on sets, what are their names and how did they end up stealing all the spotlight on those pics?"
Stoked,what was your favourite location to film?
Stoked,"The netflix adaption of Lockwood & Co was so visually stunning and still did the book series justice! 

What scene was most fun to film? Because of the scene itself, or on-set antics?"
Stoked,"For Ali, Ruby, and Cameron: what talent would you prefer to have? Touch, Sight or Listening?"
Stoked,"Thank you to everyone involved in this project! It is a pitch perfect adaptation of one of my favorite series of books. Love the cast, the settings, and the whole vibe of the show! Hoping for more seasons as I would love to see Aickmere’s Department Store and the Fittes’ headquarters scenes on screen. 

Question for the cast: what was the most challenging scene to film?"
Stoked,choose my lockwood and co themed tattoo PLEASE
Stoked,"For Cameron, Ruby, and Ali: What is your favorite song from the soundtrack? 

I love the show so much! I had never read the books, but after one watch, I was inspired to read the books! That's how great the show was! Perfect adaptation! After reading the books, i can appreciate the work that everyone put into the show that much more to bring Jonathon Stroud's masterpiece to life. Best show I've seen in years! And the acting was on point! I'm super impressed with Lockwood's character! He was literally copied and pasted from the books to TV lol. Lucy is a badass and George is hilarious and so lovable. Y'all are awesome! :)"
Stoked,"To all four of you - 

The show's had a chokehold on me ever since I watched it (as soon as it came out) and I haven't been able to eat/sleep/watch anything else because it's always on my mind! I'm not even exaggerating 

So first of all, thank you so so so so so much for this opportunity, my brain is finally at peace.

As for the question, how does it feel to be a part of something as big as this? You guys have put in your absolute 100% and trust me it shows! Not only have you catalysed the spreading of this fandom, but every single person who has watched the show has only had positive stuff to say about it!"
Stoked,Why does Lockwood wear pink socks? And are they the same ones or does he have multiple pairs lol?
Stoked,Is Lockwood jealous of Lucy initially that she can speak to type threes?
Stoked,"What was it like filming the scene when Lucy is ""possessed"" by Annabelle?"
Stoked,"Greetings from Ukraine! Thanks for the opportunity to ask you a question! After watching the adaptation, I really wanted to read the books, so I have a lot of respect for the painstaking work on the series.  
Before I ask the question, I just want to express my endless love to the actors who played their roles incredibly. This is the best adaptation from netflix in the last year, if not two :ʼD  
Questions for Ruby: did you prepare in any way for the role, I mean maybe read books to soak up the atmosphere, or maybe listen to some playlists like Ali. Maybe you were looking for something on tiktok or aesthetics on pinterest? and did you enjoy the fencing lessons before filming?  
Questions for Ali: (George is my favorite character and the way you played him is just amazing). Do you like George as a character? Do you have any similarities? maybe you found some minuses or pluses in your character?  
Questions for Cameron: When I found out that this was your debut role, it was a pleasant surprise for me, because you completely got into the character of Lockwood and his charisma. Did you read the books or maybe some excerpts? Plus you are very good at using a rapier. If you had the chance, would fencing become your hobby? Is it possible that fencing is already one of the hobbies?  
And a question for all three of you: if you had the opportunity to take a vacation as characters from the show, where would you go/fly and what would you do there?"
Stoked,"THANK YOU FOR THIS CHANCE! The show is incredible! I love it! Everyday I’m watching it twice! 
Q to Joe: Did you saved all sets, costumes and stuff for maybe a second season or has everything been dismantled?"
Stoked,"For Joe: Any deleted scenes that had to be cut due to time that could be shared?

And also, could you by chance go into detail on how the red room scene was done with the blood dripping from the walls? What had to be done to get that specific effect? 

For Cameron: What's a specific character dynamic between Lockwood and any other character that you wish we got to see more of? 

For Ruby: What was your favorite part about playing Lucy? She's such a developed character with a pretty big depth of emotions as we saw. Was it difficult to get that range of emotions without it seeming forced at all?"
Stoked,"Thank you for doing this! I have a lot of questions but I'll try to keep it to a minimum

For Joe:  Why did you decide to have Norrie get ghostlocked instead of ghosttouched?

For Ali, Ruby, and Cameron: What do you think your character's favorite movie is?

For Ruby: What was the transition like going from something like ""Bridgerton"" to a show like ""Lockwood & Co?""

For Ali, Ruby, and Cameron: In what way do you think you are similar from and different from your characters?

For Joe: Who was your favorite character outside of the main trio to write and why?

For all of you: Do you like to watch fan edits or read fanfiction? If so, what's been your favorite edit or fanfic?

For Ali: What do you think George's favorite dish to cook is?

For Joe: What made you want to adapt these books specifically into a TV show?"
Stoked,"For anyone: Which scene was the most difficult and/or took the longest to film? 

Bonus random question: what’s your favorite ghost movie?"
Stoked,"Question for everyone: what’s something that you could see the characters doing together that we don’t see in the books or on screen? Ex: dance parties to relieve stress, everyone piling into the library for a book club, etc"
Stoked,"To Ruby and Cameron,

Q: How would you guys describe Lucy and Lockwood's relationship?"
Stoked,"How do I audition for your show? They say to be bold and ask, so I'm trying!"
Stoked,For Cameron and Ali: Can you guys confirm your birthdays? The internet is going crazy trying to find them out haha
Stoked,"Hey Joe and the others!!!!
Season 1 was amazing. Can't wait for more.
So do you guys have an idea about how many seasons you want to do to wrap up the story? 
Also, episode 7 was amazing!!! Bit shoutout to the cast and crew. Loved the show."
Stoked,Favorite book in the series?
Stoked,"Thank you guys for making the PERFECT adaptation of my favourite books. I can’t believe how lucky we are to have received such an incredible adaptation 🥰❤️

I’d like to ask Cameron, Ruby and Ali- what is your favourite book in the series?
And is there a particular moment across the five books that stood out to you? 

Thank you guys for doing such an incredible job!! You honestly feel like the characters jumped from the books! 🥹❤️"
Stoked,What did you all do to get yourself into your character?
Stoked,"Loved the show so much! It felt so natural and you can definitely tell a lot of hard work and talent went into this from all aspects, wonderful actors, wonderful script, editing, everything!

Aside from the obvious haunting question of when can we expect season 2… my question for the cast is if they had to pick an ability from the show which would it be? 
For Joe, can you share what some favorite moments from the books you are/were most excited to translate/adapt into the show?"
Stoked,"(To Cameron, Ruby, and Ali) 
If you could have taken anything from the set as a keepsake, what would it have been? And why?"
Stoked,For Cameron and Ruby: Ali's mentioned in interviews that he made and listened to specific playlists to help get into character - were there songs (or other media) that helped you prepare for Lockwood and Lucy as well?
Stoked,For everyone: what is your favorite haunting in the book series?
Stoked,"Thank you so much for giving us such an awesome show! The books and the show both depict a variety of different ghost types, from Changers to Cold Maidens to Spectres. What's everyone's favourites?"
Stoked,Any fun stories from downtimes on set? How was filming on all the amazing sets + at the different locations? <33

But then I was talking to another friend who loves 3BP and she was saying that she thinks if there’s a Chinese company involved it’s because they want to make sure the parts of the book containing some not so light Chinese history aren’t produced. 

I hadn’t thought about that though and wouldn’t be surprised if that had something to do with his death. The young trying to expose the old and the old really really making sure that won’t happen."

Outnumbered,"It has gotten to the point that my dad is talking about cutting the cord and just taking out a broadband package.

The only stuff he watches on live TV anymore is sport, all of which has streaming packages."
Outnumbered,"Yeah, social media sucks"
Outnumbered,"I go through this occasionally, but I've learned to cope and tune it out. I finally broke down and learned how to do it when I discovered The Murderbot Diaries, devoured every single one of them (7 books) and sought out an online community to share my enjoyment with.

Well, apparently the entire Murderbot subculture has been co-opted by militant non-binary people who have herded together and ruthlessly smother any discussion that doesn't uphold their interpretation of what the character is all about. 

It really ruined my love of the books, until I realized I was letting them control my feelings about something I really, really enjoyed, and why should I allow them to have that control over me?"
Outnumbered,"I think the only solution is to just disengage, or limit your engagement.

Social media (including reddit, this site we're using right now) has one function: to put forward content that you will click on.

That's it. It's not a research tool, it's not a friend-meeter-upper, it's not a life coach. It'll serve those functions to a limited degree, but only insofar as it thinks you'll engage with it.

Guess what engages people? Anger. Bad opinions. Nasty serotonin from taking things down a peg, especially if they ""deserve"" it.

You really can't escape it, and you fuel it by engaging with it. Just step away. Enjoy the thing yourself, or with your friends in meatspace. Let the internet be the internet sometimes."
Outnumbered,">A female character is flawed then she's downright unlikeable, if she's perfect then she's labelled 'Mary Sue'. A show is either 10/10 or 1/10, there's no in-between.

This has been the most obnoxious part regarding the recent Rings of Power discourse. The show isn't flawless perfection and the second coming of the Jackson trilogy? Well then, it's 1/10 the worst shit ever, Tolkien's spinning his grave, etc, etc... It just makes any discussion nearly impossible. I don't think there's a lot of people saying it's the greatest show ever but there ARE a lot of people saying it's basically a blight on humanity and I just cannot understand how that is a normal reaction for people to have."
Outnumbered,I stopped watching YouTube reviewers long time ago for this same reason. I also have noticed that exposure to this toxic waste could hinder my enjoyment in tangible ways. I just watch the show or the movie.
Outnumbered,"I think, generally, identifying surface level criticisms is easy, but makes people feel smart. If you're looking for nits to pick, you'll be able to find them. And generally, people are pretty bad at identifying why they like and dislike things, and are more than willing to be dishonest with themselves about their own motivations.

I generally like criticizing the things I like, but unfortunately that isn't the norm."
Outnumbered,Unfortunately true and something I’ve noticed has made me a lot more cynical about shows. Like damn all I want to do is discuss what happened in the latest episode and all I get are threads of people complaining about every small detail that’s not in line with their expectations.
Outnumbered,"Well said. I think it’s because everyone needs to have a hot take. 

That’s my hot take anyway."
Outnumbered,"If you analyzes *everything* with a critical lens you are bound to be miserable with everything. Sometimes you just have to enjoy the ride, that's part of being a balanced individual."
Outnumbered,"Fandoms become really toxic when fans see themselves as owners of the IP. 

When you base your identity around an idea and then people begin to change it without your “permission” you can lose your shit. Especially when, in your mind tampering with the IP is akin to tampering with your identity. 

If you like a thing that doesn’t mean other people who like it will like it for the same reasons. That’s why I’m happy to like things for me and leave it at that!"
Outnumbered,"The opinions\* of others in regards to art I enjoy does not affect my enjoyment in the slightest.

You dont enjoy it? Cool.

It aint gonna make me dislike something that I am enjoying.

I think it is also important to recognize that people should be able to enjoy aspects of art without enjoying it in its totality. Too much these days we see people being polarized on opposite ends of the spectrum when the reality is that it is more about shades of grey.

*edit - \*negative opinions*"
Outnumbered,"I don't get it, can't people form their own opinion based on their viewing experience?
I'm a big fan of supernatural, i know everything wrong about it and used to go to the fandom to read their opinions on how horrible it was. and you know what i did, i tuned in the next week because i love the characters.
You actually getting bothered about ""small"" details after reading about it doesn't mean their opinions ""ruined"" the show for you, it means your standards got higher and you saw their point, it means the show was infact not entertaining.
Just to clarify, i never watched rings of power and probably never will because I'm not a big fan of the universe i don't find LOTR that much entertaining."
Outnumbered,"On the other hand, projects that add to an existing franchise should not be free from criticism *especially* because popular franchises are often used to sell things based on the name. Look at Netflix's Resident Evil. It was an absurd departure from the IP and the fans largely hated it. That's totally fair. Criticism and dissatisfaction are fine and act as a form of quality control, ***so long as the criticisms are fair and not just toxicity.*** It's up to us to filter out the fair criticisms from the garbage ones."
Outnumbered,"I think you're forgetting one major flaw... Most people that watches a show or plays a videogame aren't a part of these ""fandoms"". Off the top of my head I can mention the Final Fantasy XIV forums and subreddit as an example. Many times these places will complain non stop for the sake of complaining about anything they can and if you look at them you'd think the playerbase is a toxic mess while in reality it's one of the friendliest playerbases.  
  
Then we can look at the Nintendo Switch Subreddit as another example. I've seen people literally worship the console as if it's the most innovative thing to happen to gaming.  

We can look at one like Doctor Who communities. They're either extremely positive or extremely negative about anything and everything even remotely regarding the franchise.
  
Communities trend towards negativity because of a simple negative human factor. People want to agree with the masses not because that's how they truly feel but rather because they want admiration and validation.  
  
If I can offer you one bit of advice... Wean yourself off the need for social media and always being in the know. Enjoy your games, shows, books, movies etc. and choose for yourself what you like and dislike and remember it's okay to change your mind too! That way you'll look at media with an mostly unbiased viewpoint and base what you enjoy on your own tastes. You'll see you'll start to love a lot of things more and generally have a positive attitude!"
Outnumbered,"I guess it depends on what you mean by critical. People should engage critically with the media they consume, and examine what works and doesn't, what they like and dislike, and why those things may be. But critical in the sense of overt negativity, there is far too much of that. A lot of people don't seem to grasp that like/dislike and good/bad are not synonyms. That and the level of hyperbole these days is off the charts. If ""She-Hulk"" really is the worst TV show you've ever seen in your life, then your experience with television has been quite fortunate, lol"
Outnumbered,"Decide an opinion for yourself.

There is no reason why you should substitute anyone else's opinions for your own.

Nor should you spend time looking for other's to bolster your own opinion.

It's all subjective.

It's pretty much all valid.

(And I say this as a veteran Star Wars and Marvel fan from around these parts. We like to eat our own. lol)"
Outnumbered,[deleted]
Outnumbered,"This is why I’ve had to limit how much I participate in subreddits for TV shows I like. I subscribe because there’s good discussions and memes, but I always end up getting annoyed at all the nitpicking and negativity. Of course, there’s nothing wrong with criticizing a show or talking about parts you don’t like. But some people complain to the point where I wonder why they even bother watching a show they don’t seem to enjoy. 

I was in a sub for one show the other day where someone was complaining about small inconsistencies in the show’s timeline. But the inconsistencies were so minor that I wouldn’t have even noticed them if this person hadn’t gone into painstaking detail about it. At the time I watched it,
I was too absorbed in the story to notice. 

To each their own but I watch TV to relax and be entertained. I don’t care if it’s not perfect. For me, obsessing over imperfections or parts I don’t like sucks all the fun out of it."
Outnumbered,Thank you for saying this. I’ve actually deleted all the lotr subs for this exact reason. I love the show and found these haters attitudes were spoiling it for me
Outnumbered,Get off social media.
Outnumbered,"I don't know. For me, I like an informed opinion from someone who has more info on the thing. After an episode or 3 of the Wheel of Time and Rings of Power I wondered... Is this garbage? Cause it seems like garbage. Lol and behold, people confirming things which I was just in the cusp of noticing. My hope is that more quality content comes out."
Outnumbered,"1. Watch a television show, move on with your life.

2.  Watch a television show, read critic reviews, watch YouTube commentary about the show you just watched, make a reddit post about how you disagree with the other people posting about the show online."
Outnumbered,For me it’s the opposite. Over positive fans usually oversell the show and then when I watch it I judge it as below the standards that they set
Outnumbered,"Disagree. People are free to point out the mistakes and have a negative opinion of a show. On the contrary, it seems there are a lot of people like you who want everyone else to blindly praise everything that gets put on screen. That I find much more annoying. Everyone is free to have a (negative) opinion of a show and share it."
Outnumbered,"Fandoms can be pretty toxic. The best thing to do is to watch and enjoy the content, but minimise your exposure to people discussing it online. It will leave you disliking the material."
Outnumbered,"Okay, I agree that there are a lot of upsetting parts on the internet and a lot of people that blow things out of proportion. But honestly? The opposite of what you're saying is more annoying.

What I don't understand is the amount of people jumping to defend popular shows. I didn't even watch the lotr show nor am I really interested in it, but why is everyone saying ""think of the creators"" and ""think of the studios"" and dismissing every criticism as bad faith or an attack on the creators? Think of who, the poor multi billion dollar corporation Amazon? Who cares? Why does everyone act like they have a personal stake in it?

If you like the show, enjoy it and have fun. If you hate the community, don't interact with them. Complaining that people are criticizing something you like is basically saying everyone's opinion is toxic because it's upsetting to you. 

There's so much mediocre drivel in the media and fandoms *always* just dismiss criticism the same way you did. See: Marvel. They've gotten way worse recently. But the internet's response? ""Don't listen to the haters.""

I thought doctor strange: multiverse of madness was terrible. Two hours of nonsense. As soon as people started criticizing it, you'd get posts like *this* saying they really liked it and anyone criticizing just doesn't like things, has an ulterior motive, or is just TRYING to be toxic and ruin someone's fun. Why can't you let people **dislike** something without backlash?

There will always be haters and always be blind fanboys. Be reasonable, criticizing something isn't harmful, and you shouldn't take it personally."
Outnumbered,"I'm not one of ""just turn your brain off and enjoy it"" people. Watching shows critically and judging them does 2 things:

1. raises your standards for media in general

2. decreases the number of shows you will find enjoyable

I think ""being in a critical headspace"" is a great thing. I *want* to be in a critical headspace, I want to be able to tell if a show is any good or not, and not just come away with ""I liked it"" or ""it wasn't for me"". I enjoy the discussion around media quite a bit, recently often more so than I enjoy the media in question.

>most of these criticisms are by people who hate the show for other reasons

I do not think that's true at all. Or you use Twitter, could be that."
Outnumbered,"""Critics/fans ruined art"" isn't a new idea.  IMO the artists and fanbases/critics don't owe anything to each other.  A third party's commentary about a piece doesn't detract from the original art's value to you unless you let it.

Yes, often fandoms suck, but that shouldn't make you think less of the art, it should make you think less of humanity."
Outnumbered,"""if you dont like the show, dont watch it!""

""if you dont like critical comments, dont read them, no?"""
Outnumbered,"In recent times I’ve come to the realization that the last group of people whose opinions should be respected are the diehard fandoms for which the show is made. DC and Marvel fans have no fucking idea what a good DC or Marvel movie looks like, GoT fans have no fucking clue what makes a good GoT successor, Star Wars fans have no fucking clue what is compelling about the Star Wars universe and LoTR fans apparently have no fucking idea what is boring and what is not."
Outnumbered,"This is hilarious. You are mad at people for pointing out flaws in a show you like, you now don’t enjoy said show as much, it must be because of their toxic ideologies hidden away behind their valid criticism. Think about what you wrote in this post dude, you are admitting that you like a show less because it’s poor quality was pointed out. That is what a review is for my friend."
Outnumbered,"Social media has allowed the voices of the few to sway the many. If you turned off Twitter and Facebook you would be left with a solid fantasy TV show with an absolutely unreal visual experience. Less posts about online hate, why do we have to give so much air time to the people online who complain all the time?"
Outnumbered,"""WAHHHHH PEOPLE DON'T SHARE MY OPINIONS WAHHHHHH""

If negative reviews are so disturbing to you, don't read em. Nobody is forcing you to click the youtube videos or read the reddit posts or the imdb reviews. End of story. It's literally that easy."
Outnumbered,"Yes, fans are to blame for multi-billion dollar companies delivering subpar content. 

What definitely isn't toxic is the media branding people with criticism as racist, sexist Russian bots."
Outnumbered,"Then don't read negative opinions. If you want to only read positive takes there are plenty of subreddits that cater to that. Same if you only want to read negative comments.  

Personally, I think that dismissing most critics as ""people who hate the show for other reasons"" to be nearly as toxic as some of the people who rant about every change or accuse most people who enjoy the show as ""shills""."
Outnumbered,"But if we're being honest, the media also does a great job of blowing ""toxic fandoms"" way out of proportion."
Outnumbered,"Instead of writing this essay, you could probably not read the negative reviews?      
Rings of the Power sucks. Apart from visuals, everything else is absolutely atrocious, especially the writing. So the criticism is deserving and this rant is not going to change it."
Outnumbered,Seems like YOU are influenced by peoples' opinions then YOU get mad at them. This is your own toxic behavior. People are allowed to have their own opinions.
Outnumbered,"Maybe don't blindly agree with giant corporations who blame the fanbase for toxicity when they churn out a poorly written adaption.

I swear that last Star Wars trilogy just made people intolerant of criticism."
Outnumbered,"If people explaining what sucks about ashlw ruins it for you then you were the problem for not spotting why it sucks, and they fixed you.

Critical thought isn't making shows suck, THE SHOW CREATORS ARE."
Outnumbered,"Companies are monetizing fandoms. Fandoms owe nothing to companies. They are free to critize anything they seem fit, especially if the companies are as lazy as Amazon. 

Fans not being happy is not toxic, claiming they have to be is."
Outnumbered,Imagine wanting a safe space from television critics 😂😂😂😂
Outnumbered,"Sigh, ""fandoms"" are a community of people who like a thing, however, they don't like it all in the same way as they still remain individuals. A bit of clunky dialogue maybe a non-issue to you but could be the thing that breaks another's immersion. The show may interpret a long anticipated bit of lore in a way you're cool with but might leave another disappointed or confused, further frustrating their experience with said adaptation. So what recourse does a disappointed fan have? To vent! So they do but the problem is they do it in the same space where you want to revel and because both sides feel emotionally invested in their stances shit gets volatile. Worse yet, the Internet polarises everything so every argument becomes a dog whistle to a more sinister issue and then the true disrespect begins because everyone sees the other side as morally reprehensible.

The problem we have here is simply an inability to respect each others experiences. Much like you are frustrated by multiple posts critiquing a show you like, another is pissed when they see a post that dismisses their critiques. This isn't a fandom thing but a basic issue of socialisation that plagues all discourse. The only way to avoid it in media is really to pull a miracle and create something of near universal acclaim. However, that's something which is rarely achieved so I choose to focus on my own judgement of a thing, good or bad. If I like something I trust in that even when reading others criticisms (as half the time, the thing they're critiquing is likely the reason I like it) the reason for my enjoyment will remain consistent. Then, I try not to vilify and assume bigotry unless blatant (as to me, the assumption of moral superiority will always lead to more conflict and not less). If I hate a thing I try to vent in such a way that people understand that I'm being subjective and try not to impinge on another's  enjoyment, however, even if  I clarify that something doesn't suit my tastes someone else will eventually take offence as they feel their taste is being called into question. When that happens I try to move on cos the discussion is no longer about the story, it's now become personal.

Bottomline, is that your enjoyment of these fandoms is tied to whether there is a consensus that you agree with. When there is, those subs are fun as fuck but when there isn't your hype is dampened. That is the nature of the beast and unless you establish a personnel etiquette in how you engage that stuff  your gonna be pissed regardless if you like the show or don't."
Outnumbered,"Totally disagree. Its absolutely a good thing that people point out flaws in bad shows. We will never get anything decently written again from these big companies, if people are ok with terrible untalented writing like rings of power has. Toxicity if of course wrong, but valid criticism is not.

If you actually start hating rop because of the criticism you hear about it, that is a good thing."
Outnumbered,The first 2 episodes of the show were a slog for me for me for this very reason. I kept myself from reading things about the show and then the 3rd improved substantially.
Outnumbered,Now do the news and politics.
Outnumbered,I'm loving it so far!
Outnumbered,"I absolutely agree. When someone go on a rant about why a show is bad but then list you a list of shitty little detail or scene that have no impact, how can you takethem seriously.  Oh episode 3 of rop was bad because of that 40sec of horse rinding..please."
Outnumbered,"Good God this is one of the best posts on here in AGES and I couldnt agree with it more.

Those harpies can really ruin a show for you.  Especially on reddit."
Outnumbered,"Brooo so true 💀💀💀

I was watching the walking dead .....just said something about how i am enjoying it 

I kid you not ....one guy sends me 3pages worth of points ...for why "" my opinion is TRASH"" for liking it 

Yes it has flaws. ...but that doesn't mean ..i can't enjoy it 

In that sense....i can't do anything in life as nothing can be perfect and everything obviously has flaws.....it's a choice of mine to like it DESPITE ITS FLAWS .....

Some people just don't understand that concept.....for them it's either good or bad .....nothing can be in the middle ;("
Outnumbered,"A lot of fandoms are shit.

But I can't imagine caring so much about some random strangers opinion on something that it would affect my opinion on that same thing."
Outnumbered,"I think the fandom just magnifies what is already there. And it just so happens that most shows are shit nowadays (sorry not sorry)

During the first 4 seasons of GoT, the fandom unquestionably stoked my fire to fall in love with the show."
Outnumbered,"Hey everyone has their own opinions and nobody's being held at gunpoint to watch videos or follow fandoms,"
Outnumbered,"Judging from a lot of the comments out there you would think that RoP is just another Amazon's Wheel of Time type fiasco, then you watch the episodes and the show is actually pretty good.

It isn't perfect, sure, but until now they didn't break the lore more than Peter Jackson did, they even added in a lot of references to the first age that only book readers can understand. Numenor is honestly wonderful, beyond imagination, they nailed it. They also nailed everything about the dwarves and they absolutely nailed everything about the orcs. 

Some of the hate the show is fueled by a bunch of youtube channels that started spreading the whole narrative that the show would be a woke propaganda disaster months BEFORE the first ever teaser came out, so there is that too.

If you think that the negativity is messing with your experience, just stay away from it. Maybe you are also looking in the wrong places? I only browse r/Lotr_on_prime, the consensus there is extremely positive while criticism is reasonable, and there are lots of new theories and discussions about the show every day so you might enjoy that."
Outnumbered,The show's writing is beyond bad. It's borderline average. Exposition overload. I don't need to read other people's opinions to know this.
Outnumbered,"the risk exists, yes. I am a Nintendo fan and the subs are the most ridiculously pessimistic ones so I never read them. No big deal, I'm an adult, know very well what I like and dislike, no amount of praise or slander is gonna change my mind. 
At the same time I ain't afraid of voicing my opinion. Nothing like death threats or downright loathsome things like that, but if I think a show sucks I'll say it; that will lump me in the same hate brigade as the others, but that is inevitable


I can see how younger folks who want to be part of the community can feel disheartened though"
Outnumbered,"I think you are assuming too much innocence and naivety on the parts of the people involved in shows.

Making a show that is based on an existing IP that goes in a different direction than the initial product is a great way to attempt to make money.

It brings in the audience that initially liked the IP as well as well as the audience that likes the new direction. Naturally, this also annoys some of the fans of the existing IP and produces a negative reaction from them if the new direction doesn't land as it's hard to block out if you don't like it.

(Pretend that you like Middle Earth but, don't like Amazon's shows. You'll be hearing about them nearly constantly for at least the couple years or so whenever Middle Earth comes up. If the shows have staying power, Middle Earth may end up being primarily about Amazon's show and it's spin-offs.)

If your content is good and appeals to a wide audience, the annoyed section is going to be mostly drowned out by people that like the new content.

If the content isn't good or doesn't appeal to a wide audience, the annoyed section is going to end up being harder to drown out which leads to articles and press releases about how the people that dislike your content are bad (Let's face it if your show is being marketed to millions of people some of them will be bad.)

Amazon could have saved hundreds of millions on the IP and made a similar show to what they produced with name and visual changes while also avoiding much of the negative backlash from fans of Middle Earth that didn't want Amazon changing Middle Earth for them.

They choose not to do that because, the IP is what they feel draws people to the show not the content of the show and as a result the massive price tag for the IP was worth it to them.

This is made even more clear it's about the IP when you consider that Amazon is operating in a period of Middle Earth where the content is rather limited and Amazon doesn't actually hold the rights to all of the surrounding content.

“We have the rights solely to The Fellowship of the Ring, The Two Towers, The Return of the King, the appendices, and The Hobbit. And that is it. We do not have the rights to The Silmarillion, Unfinished Tales, The History of Middle-Earth, or any of those other books…We worked in conjunction with world-renowned Tolkien scholars and the Tolkien estate to make sure that the ways we connected the dots were Tolkien-ian and gelled with the experts’ and the estate’s understanding of the material.”"
Outnumbered,I quickly unjoined tbr r/Rings_Of_Power sub because of this
Outnumbered,"Totally agree. The fandom ruined Westworld season 1 for me.

I watched 2 and 3 without reading any fans stuff and adored them. Went back and read the Reddit comments and it just looks like a bunch of seething losers with nothing better to do all jerking themselves off and other unsuspecting people being swept up in their wake.

Like there were comments I agreed with but the way most people were writing off the show while if was airing was so melodramatic and absurd. People need to get a grip. 

I'm so glad I realised what it was before I let it ruin most media for me. Everything is 10x more enjoyable now."
Outnumbered,Some people are just negative to the point of hysteria about rings of power. Like it is unquestionably at least a decent TV show. But some people have a cult like devotion to hating it.
Outnumbered,"Very thoughtfully written and unfortunately, very true. There's absolutely no reason for a supposed fan to be so viscous. It's gotten so much worse in a relatively short time. I was mod of GoT on the former G+ and it wasn't like that then. People were very into the characters and compare the show to the books, but it wasn't nasty at all."
Outnumbered,"Has this experience with a game. The Last of us Part 2. i loved the game! It was so powerfull, moving, beautifull, fun, exciting to play! I loved the story and the characters. The story beats hit me like a truck sometimes! It was awesome! 
I intentionally kept away from reviews and trailers and anything that could spoil it for me beforehand (TLOU 1 was so good, i trusted the devs).
Afterward i finally go online to share the excitement… big mistake… 
A very loud part of the gaming community visceraly HATED the game. Hated the story. Were furious about the story decisions. They shouted at everyone who enjoyed it. 
Got sucked into it, cause i wanted to defend it… but all of that just left me exhausted and the original joy i had when playing, soon was just a memory tainted by all the things that got pointed out to me. Things i don‘t mind at all, but now i have the thought of „oh people hated this part“ when i play it and that while not destroying, still taints the experience. Wish i had just stayed away…"
Outnumbered,Yes. The hate for the new Star Trek shows is a bit loony.
Outnumbered,"This is how I felt after Thrones ended tbh. I really didn’t mind that ending as much as other people, but damn those GoT subs will try their hardest to make you feel like less of a human over that. Either you hate the ending or you’re scum I guess 🤷‍♀️"
Outnumbered,"It's basically all the internet tbh, everyone is out there to make hyperbolic statements and convince you their opinion is correct. That's why it's important to find people/peoples whose opinion you respect and who actually relay criticism well. Ever since the rise of Youtube critics all those years ago it's become way to common for people to just mimic that style of ""reviewing"". Things can't just be not for me or bad, they're now horrible and the worst thing I've ever seen. It's become ""cool"" to hate things, and there is no middle ground anymore.

A few years ago I learned it's just best to avoid it all and recognize your taste and pick what you want to see based on that. I've basically just given up on paying attention to reviews. I take a quick look at the RT score and see if it's not getting ridiculously low scores and judge for myself, only after going to the few people whose opinion I enjoy hearing. It's made my entertainment experience 100x better and actually been a big help mentally to not get sucked into all the bullshit that comes with it."
Outnumbered,"This is why i stopped reading show specific subs on Reddit; fandoms are weird and cant be reasoned with.
I just wanna enjoy my shows in peace."
Outnumbered," I feel a lot of what your saying. 

&#x200B;

The same thing happens with video games for me. Not naming the game but the sub was so toxic before and after release I just unsubbed from it. Because like you said it can influence you to pay attention to flaws that you would have never even noticed or even cared about. 

&#x200B;

Some subs get so hyperfocused on EVERY single possible flaw.. 

&#x200B;

I think one of the problems is not everyone is going to universally like ANY form of entertainment which is fine. But now those people have a soapbox to stand on in the form of the internet with a massive audience. 

&#x200B;

Before the internet if you did not like a movie, game or whatever. You just stopped watching or playing it. End of story."
Outnumbered,"I agree 1000%. I think social media impacts more than just pop media this way, I probably spend too much time considering what the mass opinion is of something rather than just being secure in what I think.

I also believe as I've gotten older I've become more critical and that's made it more difficult to suspend my disbelief and truly enjoy something like LotR: RoP."
Outnumbered,"Doctor Who fans were the worst at this around the Matt Smith era. They’d read the episode preview, go and write their perfect version of it in elaborate fanfictions and then get angry that the real episode didn’t meet their crazy high expectations. All because their head canon plot for one character didn’t match what the real writers had planned for a whole season of development. So they criticised every tiny detail. Tumblr was exhausting back then"
Outnumbered,"If you only want to be exposed to an echo chamber of pure positive reinforcement about your own sentiment toward the show, why would you seek out criticial analysis at all? 

I'm more interested about why rings of power fans are so determined to go to war with the critics, who are having a field day right now because there are so many flaws. It's a losing battle, and maybe this is why you're unhappy. Focus on what you like about the show, not attacking its critics."
Outnumbered,"Something similar I find myself doing: I'll be enjoying a show, but then something will happen and I'll think, ""The fandom is going to hate that"" or, ""People are going to be complaining that was too 'woke' and unrealistic."" Even though I'm enjoying the show and personally disagree with the presumed fandom response, it somewhat ruins the episode for me because I'm thinking about the fandom and no longer feeling immersed in the show."
Outnumbered,"Yep, so true. I don't really read reviews or engage in too much with fandoms when something is current. My exception is Fallout 4 related stuff on reddit. I feel that since the game came out a good number of years ago, the ones that are still posting content are the ones that truly love the game (like me!) %. The toxic element is gone as those people have moved on to be toxic on a sub for a different game 😂"
Outnumbered,I agree completely. Problem is we're often bombarded with these negative opinions without even seeking them out.
Outnumbered,Can someone send this guy all the counselors so they can give this man plenty of hugs.
Outnumbered,"It's not even the just the fandoms. Something I've noticed especially on social media. Barely anyone knows how to legitimately criticize something. Most of the opinions boils down to ""I don't enjoy something or I disagree with something therefore it's bad and I should tell everyone."""
Outnumbered,Yeah this is relatable. I try to block it out and enjoy it based on how I feel.
Outnumbered,"tangential but relevant: 

the hypocrisy that the same people bitching about 'cancel culture' are out here screaming about ""oh no there's a Black Ariel"" ""oh there are black hobbits"" etc, is exactly what they WANT us to be focused on and talking about.

I submit to you fellow Redditors that the more we point at this hypocrisy, the more nothing changes. We need to be calling these campaigns what they are: People trying to stop the long overdue surge in representation for people of color and women. That's all this is and that's all it's ever been about. Stop the debate. Stop the conversation. Point, shine a light on it, call it what it is: racism and sexism. And when they say ""oh you can't have this conversation because you know you'll lose"" or whatever 8th grade petulant bullshit they'll say, just remind them that you ""know what they're doing and I'm not playing your sick game.""

Fuck these racist chuds."
Outnumbered,"I get the feeling you wrote this because of Rings of Power, and frankly dude it's a bad look. People are so emotionally attached to these IPs that it makes you blind to how trash this show is; they don't want to admit it's bad so they try to attack the criticism by labelling it as racist or sexism or whatever."
Outnumbered,Y’all internet people need help. People who have nothing to do with the show shouldn’t affect you. Log off.
Outnumbered,"Thanks for this. There are certain series that have been ruined for me because the fandom sucks and I feel like I can't be part of it. Or that it is over critiqued when it's just something to enjoy. 

Yes I do like listening to reviewers talk about movies/shows online whilst doing chores/hobbies ect. But only in regards to certain thing. It's just frustrating when a fandom gets super toxic and critical and it ruins your enjoyment."
Outnumbered,"Rick and Morty has been dealing with this.  You have a bunch of fans who are so obsessively-passionate about the series, but in a super critical way where they consistently tune in for new episodes and go to the comments immediately after with their weekly rant about how it's not perfect.

It's got to be so much worse for Rings of Power between the hardcore old-school Tolkien fans and the recently-emboldened racists, but I at least know a few Tolkien fans who are enjoying it so far with no gripes about lore accuracy."
Outnumbered,"So criticizing a show hurts viewers' feelings?

Ok, Bezos, this is pretty clever.  Strong Social Media Management department you got there.

Good job.  Funny how Social Media's reactions to shows have been just peach until ROP.

Remember the final season of GOT?  The organic reaction to that was just fine."
Outnumbered,Rings of power is fuckin awesome and all the people ranting about it can eat a bag of rancid rotten orc dicks.
Outnumbered,"I'm very selective about who I watch on youtube and aggressively ""do not show me this"" the trash channels. The internet is a breeding ground for a lot of really cool things and a lot of sad people in basements and grifters. Everyone should be very firm on who they watch on youtube imo, being wound up in your downtime isn't worth it.

The culture war ""teams"" choosing every other show, film or whatever to push the barrow is punishing, and I say that as someone firmly left wing but not American (so the American ""I'm The Main Character"" syndrome in their culture war is equally grating. In ROP case, go away, Tolkien never wrote about you).

I'm a bit critical of ROP (I give it a 5/10 - middle road) because even if I accept they've thrown out all bar the broad strokes of the lore, the canon backstory and characters are more interesting and make more sense to me so it does get marked down for going its own way but not justifying it. The show is very pretty though and is entertaining enough despite trying to go wide in scope a bit too early, so while I'm a bit sad it isn't high art like Tolkien I still watch and I hope the show gets into more of a groove. Episode 3 was a lot better than the first 2. The scene with Arondir, Elf leader man and the water was really really good tension."
Outnumbered,This sub is pretty bad for it too recently that I've noticed. If somethings a 7/10 people will give it the most scathing criticism for not being Succession or something
Outnumbered,"You don’t have to interact with fandoms, if you really loved a show just watch it and do something else with your life after an episode’s over. Fandom is never forced upon anyone"
Outnumbered,"I’m applying this logic to everyone saying the Netflix resident evil show was bad. I’m so sorry it wasn’t exactly like the video games, but I really enjoyed it and was keen for more. Thanks to everyone who ruined it and got it cancelled."
Outnumbered,"Orville fans can be huge dicks in this regard.  Sure theres plenty of fans who like the show and leave it at that, usually viewers who haven't watched 80s/90s Star Trek, but for those that have seen every episode of Trek, suddenly they claim its better than Star Trek.  They often go into vague details as to why New Trek sucks, some never bothered to watch beyond one episode.  

Also difficult to have an honest Trek tread anywhere on Reddit without 3-4 users posting about how Orville is so much better & original compared to Star Trek.  Of course when the trolls try this on /r/startrek, they quickly get banned for being huge dicks, then cry about how their rights are being violated, claiming /r/startrek is a corporate owned forum. 

Im a Trek fan and I like New Trek because its different, but I have to admit some seasons have their flaws, specifically S1 of Discovery & S2 of Picard."
Outnumbered,"Really good commentary. Something has gone wrong, and the Internet enabled it."
Outnumbered,Went to the BoJack Horseman subreddit for like 20 minutes after I finished the show and wanted to gouge my eyes out
Outnumbered,"At some point people conflated spending money on something with having creative control over something. Life is much sweeter when you start to realize most popular media is just there to get you to make secondary purchases, on the other hand if your life is truly empty and shallow you may double down and make it your whole identity."
Outnumbered,">I am not saying that all criticism is bad, but most of these criticism are by people who hate the show for other reasons but hide behind these minor flaws to shit on the show.

I mean...you are a lil' bit. At the same time you're grating against critics for being hyperbolic, you are in exchange being equally hyperbolic and presumptuous about their mindset and intention. Specifically in this case because hearing criticism influences your own perspective on things, and can call your attention to what you would define as ""minor flaws"". This exact same call to arms against ""toxic criticism"" has been issued by every single fandom in history. And while you're right, criticism can and has been very very toxic, so too are fandoms often equally toxic in their rabid defense of their Favorite Things.

Online discussion tends to be very polarized, where the loudest and most brazenly stated opinions get the most traction and generate the most discussion. Which is why critics can often be so loud and aggressive, and why you're making statements like ""community so hateful and toxic that their constant seething is probably visible from fucking orbit"" about *criticism of a television show*.

Settle down."
Outnumbered,"Consider the idea that by this point ""X fans are so toxic/racist/sexist/-phobic"" has become a trope of its own and marketing is built around that idea. Disney knows making Ariel black will drive engagement about the film release so they push those stories to the forefront to create that buzz. 

Yes fandoms can be toxic but the numerous stories about how x is being targeted for taking a role are at this point counted on to sell tickets/create engagement."
Outnumbered,Nonsensical coping mechanism for a shill of a failed billion dollar tv show.
Outnumbered,RoP is still mediocre as fuck and Gladriel is an unlikable psyco.
Outnumbered,Funny how fandoms aren't having the same issue with house of the dragon. Can't be that rings of power just fucking sucks and Amazon are sending out their astroturfing shills to all of these subreddits to try and distort the reality that their show is failing badly.
Outnumbered,"Nope, it makes me feel saner that other people can see how terrible modern show runners are."
Outnumbered,"So you want to reject your own critical thinking and blame it on others? Just learn to ignore other people's opinions or stop trying to force yourself to like something you may not like as much. 

These communities (LotR, Wheel of Time, etc.) got really excited when all this new content was announced intitially, so why paint them in broad strokes as haters when their standards aren't met? You think they want to dislike things they're very passionate about?"
Outnumbered,You know what shuts up these people quickly? Actually being a good show HOTD case in point. The negativity has disappeared since it’s start.
The Next Step,[deleted]
The Next Step,I really enjoyed this show.
The Next Step,Decent show. My biggest complaint about S1 is that the John Breem character needed to be more developed.
The Next Step,"This show was surprisingly good, it really should be getting more attention. Hopefully it gets better promotion for season 2."
The Next Step,"i wanted to like this show so much and the premise had so much potential, but my god, season 1 was a train wreck and a dumpster fire.

hopefully season 2 will be good enough that i consider signing up for tv+ again"
The Next Step,I'm really hoping season 2 focuses more on the at home workout industry and less time on the unsatisfying political plotlines. The first season showed a lot of promise but was very up and down throughout.
The Next Step,I'm really tired of headlines about Arrested Development that use the word definitely. 
The Next Step,"Disappointing, really.

The Netflix revival certainly had it's ups and downs, but I would have bet anything that Hurtwitz would have made the second series ""better"" than the first. 

I doubt he would have hidden so much in the first few episodes to be clever, instead just trying to get the funny out. He knows the mistakes that were made with those early episodes being more dull, waiting for punchlines from future episodes.

However, the movie idea will certainly be interesting. The problem is that the writers will once again have to figure out the best way to structure A.D. as a movie and still retain it's charm. I believe they'll have more success with the movie as a ""first-time"" structure (compared to season 4 ""first-time"" on Netflix), but the fifth season on Netflix would have been best, especially after learning from mistakes."
The Next Step,I really want another season before they do a movie.
The Next Step,please please pleaaassse no movie =(
The Next Step,So it's going to go 2014- Movie then 2015- Season 5?
The Next Step,"always.  It has always been the plan.  Why are people suddenly so upset?  Ever since season 4 was announced, Mitch said it was going to be a different season and it would have the family split up and the entire season would be about bringing them back together and then he would make a movie.

"
The Next Step,"I am not people, I am me, and I have always hated the idea of a movie. I continue to do so."
The Next Step,why? they're still open to doing another season after
The Next Step,"I simply don't enjoy the movie format as a break from a TV routine. I know it's entirely a matter of personal preference and I'd have faith that they produce something worthy of AD, but I just don't find it appealing."
The Next Step,Delete this nephew.
The Next Step," “It went from satire to the thing it was satirizing.”  

Sounds like a Sam Levinson project."
The Next Step,"> “It was a show about a woman who was finding herself sexually, turned into a show about a man who gets to abuse this woman and she loves it.” 

😬"
The Next Step,">Casting K-pop superstar Jennie of Blackpink was the biggest get for Levinson. Under the show’s hashtag and teaser trailers, her stans steamrolled comment sections to cheer on the singer in her first acting role. But crew members claim Jennie has barely any air time and an inconsequential story arc. “It was like three or four lines per episode for her,” a production source says. “They didn’t let her talk that much. Her job was to sit there [and] look pretty, basically.” 

Like YG Entertainment would have agreed to anything more. They now have a well-established reputation for overhyping and underdelivering."
The Next Step,Sam Levinson seriously needs to jerk off before coming into work.
The Next Step,">The first public inkling of trouble came last April, when director Amy Seimetz, of The Girlfriend Experience and She Dies Tomorrow, suddenly exited with roughly 80 percent of the six-episode series finished. HBO addressed the news by confirming The Idol was set to have a major creative overhaul and would be adjusting the cast and crew. There was little explanation for the shakeup, except for reports that Tesfaye, who is co-creator, felt the show was heading too much into a “female perspective.”

&#x200B;

I mean, the protagonist is a woman, how is leading too much into a female perspective is bad?"
The Next Step,"I understand that Levinson is a fucking creep, but let’s not forget that The Weeknd is co-creator, co-writer, exec. producer, and apparently put in the request that turned the show on its head. Whatever comes of this, he deserves just as much blame as anyone else, and it’s crazy that most people are kinda glossing over that."
The Next Step,It’s insane that Euphoria will coast over 100 million for the next season.
The Next Step,"Man, I was mostly interested in this show just for Amy Seimetz. Replacing her killed my interest even before all that shitshow."
The Next Step,Every single thing I read about Sam Levinson screams *”I’M THE SON OF A FAMOUS DIRECTOR SO I THINK I CAN DO WHATEVER I WANT!!!!”*
The Next Step,I seem to recall that the original director had wanted episodes exploring Lily rose depp’s character’s personal life and relationship with a childhood friend- good reflective stuff that gives the show depth. Anyway The Weeknd vetoed it for being too feminist 💀
The Next Step,"> Levinson allegedly stopped sending scripts to HBO and certain department heads, according to two people familiar with the matter. “I got the vibe that the mood on set was, ‘What’s HBO gonna do, pull the plug? Yeah, right. If they want a third season of Euphoria, they’ll give me what I want… We’re just gonna shoot what we want and if [HBO execs] have a problem with it, that’s their problem,’” they explain. 

wouldn't be surprised if Euphoria gets canned after this, the arrogance is astonishing"
The Next Step,"*Seimetz seemed set up to fail from the start. When she arrived on set seven weeks before the show started filming, she was given half-finished scripts, a first-time showrunner in Epstein, a tight schedule, and near-impossible expectations from HBO, those sources say. “Amy was doing her best in an impossible situation, but she was going to lose this no matter what,” one production member says. “Honestly, I think HBO handed her a shit stack.” (Seimetz declined to comment.)  HBO had wanted to keep costs low with a series budget around $54 million...Euphoria’s upcoming third season, which is expected to cost at least $110 million.*

So they wanted to do it cheaply, didn't make sure the script was done, drove the director out of the project before it was done, reshot the whole thing writing it in a completely different way...  It's sounds like the developmental execs at HBO are terrified to do their job well given all the projects getting axed by the new overlords."
The Next Step,I went from wow that sounds like a mess to work on to wow an egg where and she is begging him for what?!?! I like dark shows and shows that push the envelope but this is not it.
The Next Step,I know several people worked on this show and I’ve yet to hear a single person say a good thing about it. Such a fucking mess and it definitely crossed into dangerous territory once Levinson was there.
The Next Step,They gave The Weeknd too much power and not surprisingly he went on an ego trip. He has that movie with Jenna Ortega and Barry Keoghan that he's also writing and producing up next which is too bad because we'll probably hear something similar there.
The Next Step,"I'm genuinely starting to believe that this show does not and never will actually exist, and that its seemingly neverending promotional rollout/behind-the-scenes soap opera is in itself a work of Andy Kaufmanesque performance art. Certainly I'm no closer to knowing - beyond the bare-bones outline - what the hell the actual story is supposed to be than I was when it was first announced approximately two thousand years ago, so maybe it really is all just an elaborate Situationist prank?

At any rate, I think it's very funny that everyone's wringing their hands about an obviously planted story that paints the show as a dark, dangerous, boundary-smashing orgy of decadence, which just so happens to be the exact image its makers are going for. [This legendary Onion story](https://www.theonion.com/marilyn-manson-now-going-door-to-door-trying-to-shock-p-1819565904) kept springing to mind."
The Next Step,All of Sam Levinson’s projects seem like a dumpster fire to work on. His sets are always chaotic and messy and unorganized. And this torture porn thing is not a good look.
The Next Step,"""Falling too much into a female perspective [paraphrased]”

The Next Step,ok but that egg scene? have you lost your damn mind levinson?
The Next Step,"Levinson sounds like a budding Weinstein. Dude's private, sketchy predilections coming out publicly, and all he gets is more money and power. 

When someone shows you who they are, believe them the first time, Hollywood."
The Next Step,I'm not going to be surprised at all if some kind of Kevin Spacey/Bryan Singer/Harvey Weinstein type stories come out about Sam Levinson. I am surprised they haven't come out yet.
The Next Step,Sam Levinson’s got some issues.
The Next Step,"Warning: Rape, Sexual Assault

“At various points, Levinson’s scripts contained disturbing sexual and physically violent scenes between Depp and Tesfaye’s characters, three sources familiar with the matter claim. In one draft episode, there allegedly was a scene where Tesfaye bashes in Depp’s face, and her character smiles and asks to be beaten more, giving Tesfaye an erection. (This scene was never shot, the source says.) Another proposed scenario was for Depp to carry an egg in her vagina and if she dropped or cracked the egg, Tesfaye’s character would refuse to “rape” her — which sent Depp’s character into a spiral, begging him to “rape” her because she believed he was the key to her success. (This scene also was not filmed because production couldn’t find a way to realistically shoot the scene without having Depp physically insert the egg, another source explains.) “

Can someone check Levinson’s and The Weeknd’s hard drive and search history please. I know that these ended up not getting filmed but why were they up for consideration in the first place?"
The Next Step,"Even since it was revealed that The Weeknd felt that the show was heading too much into a ""female perspective"" and therefore decided to change that I knew the show would end up being messy."
The Next Step,This will either bomb or this will be such a huge hit that talking heads will question if this is the further moral decline and decadence of society.
The Next Step,The Weekend is a misogynist? How unsurprising.
The Next Step,Wish Harmony Korine was at the helm 😀
The Next Step,Well I'm glad I'm not the only person who thinks Euphoria is creepy voyeurism and not the show of a generation anymore
The Next Step,"Reading the whole article, it appear that as problematic as Sam's writing is, the issues were apparent long before he took over.

Looking at some of these quotes in bold:

**As promising as those initial scripts were, the scripts for the final episodes were still only half-finished and the finale completely unwritten. Seimetz was encouraged by HBO and producers to put her own spin on the show and write the last episode, a source explains. As a result, Seimetz was polishing up scripts and writing while directing. She also had her assistant, who had no previous credited writing experience, writing scenes, with HBO making the assistant a staff writer last January. (The assistant did not respond to a request for comment.)**

**Organization quickly evaporated, mainly due to changes in the script, sources say. One production member says the first version of the show went through more than 20 rewrites, saying scripts were being updated constantly: “We did it every fucking day. It was insane.** 

**Eventually, the crew say they stopped getting one-liners, an industry term for daily schedules of what was being shot. And the few one-liners that were given out quickly became useless due to changes, sources say. Decisions were being made on the fly, frustrating several crew members who say they felt they could never properly prepare for the next day of work. “I’d be driving home [at the end of the day] and they’d be like, ‘Oh, we’re adding a scene, but it hasn’t been written yet,’” one says.** 

**A report from April blamed the show’s overhaul on Tesfaye, who was reportedly unhappy that the story was focusing too much on Depp’s character, according to Deadline. A source with knowledge seconds that Tesfaye was the reason behind the shakeup, wanting to tone down the cult aspect of the storyline and pivot into something else entirely, dropping the “feminist lens” through which the show was being told as a result. “It was like the Weeknd wanted one show that was all about him — Sam was on board with that,” another source explains to Rolling Stone.**


In a six episode season, if you still have unfinished scripts for the remaining episodes and an unwritten final episode while you are filming an hectic production, it is obvious that the problem are deeper than just one person.


From reading the quotes above, It look like nobody had any actual finished outline of what direction the show was going toward or how it would end since they admitted that they already have gone through 20 rewrites while Seimetz was still in charge of the show. 

When you are rewriting scripts that many times and you still haven't even finished the scripts for the remaining episodes in a six episode season, it will be difficult to have a coherent story and character development. 

The crazy thing is that if this was a 22 episode season, it would make sense to have rewrite or revision to the scripts due to the length of the season but when you are struggling to write up only six episodes with a small timeframe for shooting and production, this is basically an issue from HBO management to the writing team. 

As problematic and disturbing as the reports have been about Sam especially backstage on Euphoria, it appear that just blaming him is the easy way out regarding the issues plaguing this show. 

The article make it clear that the issues were there from the first day of production before he was even involved and that the issues just kept getting worse as shooting continued. 

Also, It look like Tesfaye wanted the show to be more about him and his character compared to Depp's character. When you have one of the two Main Character of the show apparently having an issue with a woman character being the focus, you are going to have a difficult time appeasing him unless you recast him with a new actor who would be fine with allowing a woman to shine.

Honestly, you can just lay the blame on HBO management which appear to have an unrealistic deadline and a refusal to oversee what actually is going on regarding the scripts and production."
The Next Step,Kpop fans will make or break this show.
The Next Step,[removed]
The Next Step,"Slightly off topic but does anyone else share this opinion about The Weeknd:

He sings about all the drugs and sex he does but form the very beginning I was like “nah,  I don’t believe you.”  He’s trying too hard. Like that kid that brags about his hot girlfriend but you don’t know her cause she goes to another school. He’s always giving lil dick energy. Some artists can pull it off, the attitude, the machismo, but not him. He’s a dork to his core. A pretender. 

Solid pop music though. Can’t argue with his phenomenal success!"
The Next Step,I mean Euphoria was softcore porn with the appeal of teenagers pretending they invented fucking wasn't it?
The Next Step,I always found the critics absolute obsession and love for this show odd. The length to which they show drugs and sex not only feels weird to watch it’s also just not accurate. Then again maybe most of the critics hadn’t experienced high school in some time so they actually thought this was accurate.
The Next Step,Honestly I stopped watching euphoria after a season because it just made me feel yucky.
The Next Step,"Tbh, you could also make a fine argument about euphoria glamorizing drugs and debauchery, more than actually addressing its problems. Just watch the first few minutes of the very first episode and you'll understand,lol"
The Next Step,Same with Euphoria.  It’s porn.   You can tell his intended audience is one that enjoys sec versions of saw.
The Next Step,"His Netflix film, Malcom and Marie was utter garbage in my opinion. I enjoyed Euphoria but when I look back on why I enjoyed it nothing comes to mind. I tried rewatching it with my girlfriend and found it to be more annoying than thought provoking or even entertaining."
The Next Step,"Justice for Amy Steimetz, an actually talented director with a VIEW and not just sensationalist style over substance.

This could have been so good with her given how terrific The Girlfriend Experience was."
The Next Step,[deleted]
The Next Step,The joys of Hollywood nepotism. Does Sam even know what real life is like?
The Next Step,"Used to date his former nanny. She’s also a total sociopath, and I’m not surprised she found herself in his employ. Hope this is the end of his gross and weird almost-middle-aged-man-cum-teen-sex-fantasizer trip."
The Next Step,"You can tell this show is going to be fucking sick, not in a good way. Euphoria works because it’s a more modern day “skins” but with all this stuff coming out about this guy his shows and its intentions are starting to show themselves"
The Next Step,"Zendayas story arch aside, Euphoria is just Degrassi with penises."
The Next Step,This is pretty obviously some marketing hype disguised as an expose.
The Next Step,What an awkward headline
The Next Step,This is giving Marlon Brando/Bernando Bertolucci vibes (IYKYK)...
The Next Step,"Sam do be into depraved, toxic sexuality."
The Next Step,"on the fence about whether this is *intentional* marketing -- but given that this exact article has been posted on Reddit 11 separate times, has almost 1500 comments on this thread alone, Tesfaye had a targeted and ready-made clip to respond to Rolling Stone with, and it subsumed discourse all day yesterday on other social media platforms incl. Twitter, I'm pretty sure it generated exactly the kind of outrage/buzz that will propel the premiere to sky-high viewership. Happy to revisit this comment when the show premieres and eat my words if I'm wrong but I doubt I will be. It's worth noting that the loudest critics of Euphoria have usually watched 16 episodes, maybe even all 18.

I'm pretty disturbed at how comfortable everyone is casually slinging around rumors about Levinson being some kind of predator, though. Not only is there zero evidence of that, but there's not even any *allegations* of him being remotely creepy. There's not even anything to disprove, just people clearly hoping that bad things will come out about him presumably because they dislike his work so much. Levinson certainly doesn't seem to find his own work as titillating as everyone here clearly does -- [seriously, I'd recommend reading this THR interview with him, he comes off as very thoughtful and just...not creepy](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/euphoria-creator-boundary-pushing-hbo-drama-didnt-pull-punches-1218588/) -- and nearly all the social media comments are bursting with inter-generational hysteria about Kids These Days and dismissing Euphoria as porn while clearly ignoring the fact that Euphoria is making a commentary on how the ubiquity of internet porn has affected culture and particularly teenagers. I respect it for at least trying to start a cultural conversation on how porn is affecting youth and sexual expectations/gender dynamics especially when a lot of the takes around porn are just like, ""why don't you just jerk off in the privacy of your own room, you sick freak, and we can all pretend this huge cultural force doesn't exist.""

All this is not to discount the worrying accusations in the article, such as that of a disorganized set -- poor work conditions are no joke -- but all of the other stuff like the description of the egg scene, which wasn't even filmed, is to some extent clearly being enjoyed as salacious and transgressive by those who read it. Rape kinks are real and [not uncommon](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19085605/), another thing that could stand to be critically engaged with instead of acting like it's some collective dirty secret. Maybe the show failed at that but we can't really say until watching, which I'm sure most people will -- but I'm fascinated by how many people will eat up Levinson's work and then will completely miss the commentary or continue to insist he's some pervert. This conflict between what people do/want and what they openly admit to doing and wanting is a running theme throughout his prior work....and if you don't believe me on that then read the THR interview. anyway, ready to get downvoted into oblivion lol"
The Next Step,"Why do people keep hiring Lily-Rose Depp?

How much is this costing her dad in influence and cash?"
The Next Step,Gonna be funny watching everyone slowly realize Sam Levinson is a total hack…
The Next Step,Idk something tells me we will one day be talking about Sam Levinson the way we talk about J*ss Wh*d*n
The Next Step,"This: 
>	Tesfaye, who is co-creator, felt the show was heading too much into a “female perspective.”

Plus this:
>	It was like any rape fantasy that any toxic man would have in the show — and then the woman comes back for more because it makes her music better,”

Is super disconcerting."
The Next Step,"I’m not a huge Euphoria fan, and I tend to agree that Zendaya’s arc is definitely the best (and maybe the only good) storyline, but I’m always a bit confused by Reddit’s disgust for the show. 

It’s definitely not a super realistic depiction of high school and it’s way over dramatized, but people do drugs and have sex in high school. I went to a tiny school and even there we had heroin addicts, meth addicts, etc. People had sex at parties. It was certainly way more awkward and not as glamorous as it is on Euphoria, but Euphoria is purposefully melodramatic.

The nudity can be too much, but all of the actors are in their mid-twenties. I don’t really agree that it’s pedophilic of the creator to depict high school sex.  All of Harmony Korine’s early movies had  more fucked up stuff involving kids and teens than Euphoria does."
The Next Step,Dude is a scumbag. Plain and simple.
The Next Step,Read the stuff that got cut and I think I'm going to skip this one.
The Next Step,">There was little explanation for the shakeup, except for reports that Tesfaye, who is co-creator, felt the show was heading too much into a “female perspective.”

Oh boy."
The Next Step,"Its funny, I work in TV maeketing. Was watching a few trailers of The Idol today for work and said to my co workers “this is just softcore porn”."
The Next Step,"I'm so fucking done with overly sexual shows and movies. I just want a good show/movie without having to see extremely graphic sex scenes for way too long or straight up pansexual orgies.

I want to be captivated, not shocked. It has nothing to do with my beliefs (atheist) and I'm not sexually frustrated, I just hate it because of how unnecessary it is. If I wanted to watch porn, the internet's full of it already. It's not art, it's just showing everyone you're a fucking pervert."
The Next Step,Sam Levinson is gonna be one of those guys you find out in twenty years was doing some mad creepy shit behind the scenes
The Next Step,Euphoria sucked so I’m sure this will too.  At least it looks like the characters are supposed to be adults at least.
The Next Step,"The Weeknd deserves as much blame as Levinson imo, dude was a co-producer. Even some of his earlier music references taking advantage of young models, etc. Fucking creeps."
The Next Step,More high school teens fuckin... I mean that's HBO's bread and butter
The Next Step,I just know Sydney Sweeney is going to expose Sam once *Euphoria* is done. Expecting the upcoming season to be its last tbh.👀
The Next Step,"“The Idol, which is being billed as a **darker, crazier, and more risqué** version of Levinson’s smash-hit Euphoria.”

Wait, WHAT?"
The Next Step,"It's not porn, it's HBO.

https://youtu.be/pBhLI3NqnaQ"
The Next Step,Sam Levinson sounds like one of those guys in Hollywood who is going to become a major flash in the pan and done with.
The Next Step,"Never seen Euphoria, is it good?"
The Next Step,Wasn’t interested in seeing it but now they’ve got at least 2 guaranteed episodes out of me.
The Next Step,"I bet zaslav loves that shit, it combines the unscripted trash he became famous for with the high budget and audience HBO brings"
The Next Step,"Every single reasonable Euphoria fan: ""Yeah, I could see Sam Levinson doing that"""
The Next Step,"Nepo Depp ""best director ever worked for""...in her long and storied career phhht"
The Next Step,"Who want's to start a pool and bet on when Sam Levinson is going to get his first accusation of sexual misconduct? Maybe he hasn't yet, and he legit thinks he's just an artist, but people lie to themselves all the time and often times the harder they try and cover shit up, the more it pokes through. Either way, I'm leaving this here so I can link back to it when it becomes clear I was right."
The Next Step,It does suck if hbo enocouraged seimetz to do her own take and bailed on her...But overall I dunno...its the weeknd's show basically.If he wants it changed I guess I don't see the problem.The main creative leads are him and levinson I think(?).
The Next Step,"I'd never heard of this show until just now. It sounds terrible and expensive. 


HBO is about to lose their asses on this train wreck if it ever actually comes out, I'm getting some 12 Miles of Bad Road vibes from this article."
The Next Step,Oh man is Hollywood a bad place
The Next Step,"Interesting marketing plan, HBO..."
The Next Step,"Mark my words, this man's career will be hit with a sex crime scandal, most likely from him being a predator."
The Next Step,"That was a fucking trip to read, yikes, I loved Euphoria’s first season and haven’t watched the second yet, but this dude seems like trouble"
The Next Step,Nice try but I’m still not watching a show starring those fools. You could tell me they literally get tortured to actual death and I’d still refuse. 😂
The Next Step,Never go full Ryan Murphy.
The Next Step,"Wow you mean to tell me that a man who dated Bella Hadid since she was underage and visited all the Covid-unsafe parties in LA is self-centered and egotistical? That’s crazy, I would have never thought."
The Next Step,"I'm sure the production of the show has been bad. But this article, to me, seems like it's slanted in a weird way.

The article seems written to imply that something changed from the ""original"" show to ""the current show"" due to the involvement of Levison and The Weeknd. But Levinson and The Weeknd created the show.

I'm failing to understand how the show transforms from A to B when the creators are also the same people leading now. I would understand it if you said it went from A to B to A, but that's not what it says, nor does it say Seimetz rewrote the whole thing. The current version of the show sounds exactly like Levinson and The Weeknd, so how could it have been different in the beginning and why would they have wanted it to be different?"
The Next Step,Who exactly is surprised with those two involved?
Mock the Week,"Considering the turmoil in the UK right now, this is almost the worst time for them to be leaving."
Mock the Week,"Politicians have started their own version called Mock the Weak.

Edit:spelling"
Mock the Week,"All the comedians on the final show were great. Although.. I can’t help but wish they tried to assemble one of the OG casts for the last show. Russel Howard, Frankie Boyle, Hugh Dennis, Andy Parsons etc. I know it was probably all down to budget and whatever but would have been a nice way of ending “where it all began” sort of thing"
Mock the Week,"Pity.

What's the best panel show now? 

Is it Have I Got News For You by default? Because that show has been coasting for a decade now."
Mock the Week,"I'm American and I thought it was hilarious.

Gonna miss it"
Mock the Week,And in that time Andy Parsons didn’t say anything funny ever
Mock the Week,"They outlasted truss, just as they predicted they would!"
Mock the Week,"As an American, this is going to significantly hamper my access to fresh James Acaster material."
Mock the Week,"*Nooo, don’t leave me!!*"
Mock the Week,That was one long week
Mock the Week,"It hadn't been anywhere near as good after Frankie left. It's not necessarily his shock humour that made it what it was, but he was so outrageous and quick that it seemed to elevate everybody else. Watch some of those 'Too Hot for TV' videos on YouTube and you'll see that amazing chemistry he had with Dara and Russell shine through and the guests generally up their game (even Gina Yashere wasn't terrible)."
Mock the Week,These guys could start a new youtube channel where these known faces drop by and make jokes and stuff or more. They could set up their own big game show or whatever.
Mock the Week,"As an American I only found out about British panel shows during the pandemic, but even as a newcomer I'm going to miss this show a lot!"
Mock the Week,[deleted]
Mock the Week,Noooooooo
Mock the Week,They couldn't come up with anything more ridiculous than this week.
Mock the Week,I really wish it wasn't cancelled since I've recently got into this.
Mock the Week,"It was ok the first few seasons but I think the formula
became stale pretty quickly, it became painfully obvious the shows were rehearsed, which of course they would be but it felt like they didn’t even try to disguise it."
Mock the Week,I've discovered this show recently through IG feeds and was immediately hooked. Now I read this. Bummer.
Mock the Week,I’ve never been so sad to see a tv series go hopefully it is replaced with something similar it was always a fun show.
Mock the Week,Over to you Dave TV
Mock the Week,Maybe there's a new generation about to come up and they'll be great. That would be a nice thought.
Mock the Week,They have a YouTube Playlist of a lot of their Scenes we'd like to see portion I'd highly recommend. It's fucking hilarious.
Mock the Week,Is that because the Torries are funny enough on their own?
Mock the Week,They'd be mad not do Mock the Year once every Christmas.
Mock the Week,"It ran its course. It was good but the last few years have been the same jokes just cycling through whatever celebrity or political gossip was ""freshest."" I stopped watching before COVID and was surprised when they returned tbh."
Mock the Week,"With Frankie gone and Sean (rip) gone, Dara was the only reason I’d watch. It was time frankly.

Edit: Sean wasn’t on MtW, I swore he was!"
Mock the Week,Good. The comedians ran their schtick into the ground and the guests were just a revolving door of the same core group in every comedy show as well as few choice individuals the BBC wished to push to the fore. It peaked in the Frankie Boyle era.
Mock the Week,Died when Frankie left
Mock the Week,"Good, it's been fucking horrendous for years."
Mock the Week,"Topical satire often relies on the ability to punch both ways, particularly if it’s being produced by the BBC. This type of show (and moreso HIGNFY) thrived in the Blair years because everyone in politics was a bastard, but there were favourable economic conditions so the stakes weren’t that high. The political landscape of the last decade has shifted dramatically where there has often been a clear good guy/bad guy dynamic with serious consequences, which means a bunch of light entertainers guffawing at forced “both sides” jokes is hardly going to excite the next generation of viewers."
Mock the Week,About 13 years too late.
Mock the Week,Hasn’t been funny since Frankie Boyle left
Mock the Week,"Stopped watching when Angela Barnes became a regular fixture, incredibly unfunny woman"
Mock the Week,Nobody on Reddit is going to know what it is
Mock the Week,What will Uncle Fester do with his time now?
Mock the Week,"Mock the week was dead when they fired the angry funny scotsman.

At the same time they lost the third Proclaimer, Mock the week became just a boring show without any real criticism of current events, and there needed to be a place in media which was a consumable show for the masses that put the bullshit into its proper context."
Mock the Week,Not been funny for years.
Mock the Week,Never heard of it. Weird.
Mock the Week,Hasn’t been at its best since they starting using it as launching pad for new comedians rather than using the best comedians in the country.
Mock the Week,Finally! I stopped watching 12 years ago
Mock the Week,Ended when Frankie left tbh
Mock the Week,This should have ended 15 years ago
Mock the Week,"After watching a few of them it really showed how formulaic most of the comedians are.

Most of my favourite comedians aren’t wired type A personalities so they’d struggle to get a joke in when they did appear.

Didn’t miss it when I stopped watching it, doubt others will either apart from those downvoting me because apparently the grief for the loss of Andy Parsons shouting is too much to bear."
Mock the Week,It ended about ten years ago for me.
Mock the Week,Oh no. Anyway
Mock the Week,It always felt like a filler.
Mock the Week,Was never funny for an instant. Hugh Dennis is insufferable.
Mock the Week,Never heard of it
Mock the Week,"I really won’t miss it. Hadn’t been funny for a long while, and wasn’t even that good at its best."
Mock the Week,"Didn't know it was still going tbh. I got pretty bored with it several years ago and just never picked it back up, same with a lot of panel shows. For every laugh, theres a few minutes of boredom."
Mock the Week,"I stopped watching a good while ago, but is Frankie not on it anymore? Weird not to see him in the title image."
Mock the Week,"maybe it is funny if you are British, but I find it really awful"
Mock the Week,[removed]
Mock the Week,"To me, Mock the Week was the vanilla ice cream of the panel show world. I don't mean that expensive Carte D'Or or Waitrose Duchy Organic creamy vanilla stuff with the little vanilla pod seeds in it. I mean the mass produced, suspiciously too yellow, bargain tub Country Range or ""Summertime"" 4 litres for a tenner on offer variety. The kind you reach for when the alternative is re-watching episodes of Tipping Point or Eggheads. I mean who doesn't feel a certain amount of instant anger and despair at the sight of Andy Parsons or Milton Jones. Without Dara Ó Briain the show would have died on it's arse almost immediately."
Mock the Week,Such a sad day. Im going to binge watch all of it again
Mock the Week,I think Mock the Week was one of the first shows I ever streamed on BBC IPlayer.
Mock the Week,I hope Dara O'Brien finds a better gig.
Mock the Week,"The week is mocking itself, there's just no need anymore"
Mock the Week,Nooooooooooo!! There goes all the witty jokes that I can recycle about current events.
Mock the Week,"On the other hand, these days the week mocks itself."
Mock the Week,This is like when Jon Stewert left the Daily show timing.
Mock the Week,"They have basically been forced off air by tories who have captured the BBC.

[Ed Burns summed it up quite nicely.](https://twitter.com/SeidGoro/status/1581038713198366720)"
Mock the Week,"I think the bbc hired some Tory and they cancelled the show, go figure"
Mock the Week,Have I Got News For You is still going and is going pretty strong IMO.
Mock the Week,I’m pretty sure the people behind the turmoil in the UK right now are the same people responsible for the show’s cancellation.
Mock the Week,yeah but even mock the week cannot compete with plain news program in UK since the Brexit
Mock the Week,Like when Jon Stewart left at the worst time
Mock the Week,[deleted]
Mock the Week,Still have hignfy and FB's New World Order
Mock the Week,"Ironically enough, they finished recording the final episode...

...the night before Truss resigned.

That's probably the biggest tragedy of all here. They couldn't get the last laugh."
Mock the Week,It was just a bunch of comedians going through scripted material anyway.
Mock the Week,"Well the BBC also axed Russell Howard's show so he moved it to Sky, so can't imagine him being too up for going back to the BBC.

You may have also forgotten but Rory Bremner was actually an OG team member."
Mock the Week,Would I Lie to You
Mock the Week,8ooTCDC.
Mock the Week,"QI.  Best panel show ever, Stephen Fry was truly great but Sandi Toksvig (sp) is also quite good and the panel is usually quite good also

Edit: corrected, thank you /u/FamousOrphan"
Mock the Week,[deleted]
Mock the Week,"HIGNFY has 64 seasons, and all on YT."
Mock the Week,Big Fat Quiz of the Year is always a good time
Mock the Week,I quite enjoy Richard Osman’s House of Games
Mock the Week,It’s not coasting now. Merton improved his way of dealing with shitty news.
Mock the Week,"Eight Out Of Ten Cats Does Countdown. And it's not close.

&#x200B;

HIGNFY is just a way to end up with this shower we have now."
Mock the Week,"I think I laugh more at WILTY than any of the others. 8ooTCDC has its moments as well. If Taskmaster counts, that wins hands down but I don't think it is? HIGNFY all feels a bit self congratulatory a lot of the time, as well as giving Boris a platform."
Mock the Week,I've enjoyed Frankie Boyle's New World Order as a commentary on the shitshow.
Mock the Week,Would I lie to you
Mock the Week,"Have I got news for you is the champion of panel shows. 

Only beat by have I got a bit more news for you."
Mock the Week,"QI, not quite the same but i do like it"
Mock the Week,I don't think there are any really good panel shows left. Compare something from this year to something from the late 2000s and it's like a different world. It's become so incredibly toothless.
Mock the Week,"Cats does countdown is great as many have said, but I have to say I look forward to the Big Fat Quiz every year also. Although it may not count as it is only twice a year."
Mock the Week,Would I lie to you and Taskmaster are absolute musts
Mock the Week,but THE DAILY MAIL
Mock the Week,He did once but it was a joke stolen from a Douglas Adams book.
Mock the Week,"""I'm going to make Chicken Tonight, tomorrow. SMASH THE SYSTEM!"""
Mock the Week,Andy Parsons was hilarious. Nobody gives him anywhere near enough credit.
Mock the Week,"Eh, James hadn't been on since like 2018, he even said in his one appearance this season that he intentionally doesn't follow the news."
Mock the Week,I assume you listen to Off Menu already?
Mock the Week,I hope you haven't seen the season of Taskmaster he appeared on.. If not you're in for a treat!
Mock the Week,Same. He's my fave.
Mock the Week,Every so often you'd see Frankie smiling and Dara would look at him and smile and you just knew Frankie was about to say something mental.
Mock the Week,Rhys James has been fire in the newer episodes
Louis Theroux,"The main characters came across as YouTubers who had found a demographic they could sell to. Like modern day evangelicals preaching hate rather than the lord, whether they believed it or not. The main thing they wanted was clicks, likes and donations and were prepared to say anything to increase their audience. Hopefully they'll look back on it in a few years and regret how they were making a living"

Louis Theroux,Imagine thinking Brittany Venti is terrifying. The guy is a pussy.

Louis Theroux,Where can you watch this in the USA?
Louis Theroux,"Don’t know about the rest of them but that is exactly that Baked Alaska character. Don’t remember the history now, less notable since there are so many of types now, but the guy did a 180 and reinvented himself as whatever this is now."
Louis Theroux,"Everything you said literally describes ""breadtubers"" like Hasan Piker. It's not like it's only the right that has money-scheming sleazebags looking to dime on others for content."

Louis Theroux,"Dude...have you watched anything hasan piker has done? He's a jerk, but not a con-man."
Louis Theroux,"I've noticed that too, whenever there is someone with a following who isn't woke, they're always called a grifter on here."
Louis Theroux,America first bitch
Louis Theroux,"So what he actually said was “I’m not in your house”. 

Most likely the house was rented by the streamer for the interview. Or possibly even by the show’s production team at the streamer’s request."

I dunno about that, there wasn't much difference of opinion about, say, vaccines up until about a year or so ago"
Louis Theroux,"Why wouldn't he make a documentary about violent people on the far-left? I mean youtube is free and there's plenty of evidence and material to take from, also plenty of shitheads to interview."
Louis Theroux,Theroux is an unbiased documentarian. I assume he has ALSO interviewed actual terrorists like Black Bloc

Louis Theroux,sadly BBC knows detects the biggest VPN services and will normally catch you. At least in my experience
Louis Theroux,"You point out that there are some bigger differences of opinion these days, but that doesn't conflict with what the guy above you said.

He said that we have *less actual interaction* with people who hold differing opinions. A few years ago, my extended family could get together and interact despite their differing political opinions. Ever since covid, our actual interactions have gone down. Things have become more digital (like through watching a video of a professional interacting with a few members of a group, then forming an opinion of that group through those carefully curated clips).

I wonder if the same can be said for violent right wingers."
Louis Theroux,"That would be odd, since it’s a documentary about a different subject."
Louis Theroux,"Lmao rightoids have been shooting places up here for years, but judging by your comments those guys are false flags right. Dylan Roof himself has a bodycount bigger than all of fucking black bloc. You want to find feds? go to a ""black bloc"" meeting"
Louis Theroux,"Oh, I heard someone from the states did it and they were surprised how easy it was."
Louis Theroux,">He said that we have less actual interaction with people who hold differing opinions.

Does that mean interacting with them on the internet doesn't count, then?"
Louis Theroux,Thanks captain obvious.
Louis Theroux,It’s a series. That’s how Theroux works.

 Haven't been able to watch any since."
Louis Theroux,">All the stuff he did in the past 10 years was covering extremely heavy depressing topics.

Yet they were topics that don't get that much coverage, making them worthwhile covering. Louis Theroux using his name and clout bought to light some very difficult subjects. 

If you want light entertainment I suggest you chug down the latest garbage from one of the several reality TV studios."
Louis Theroux,The stuff where he interviews various types weirdos is fairly light hearted. Like people who believe they can talk to aliens on distant worlds etc. That stuff might be 15 years old at this stage.

Credit to John Oliver though, the guy is from a normal middle class/working background and fought his way through to where he is.

""Not really"""
Louis Theroux,"When he sang “faith” to those religious people but introduced it as a song about god and faith, that was some of the best deadpan delivery. Cut to everyone looking horrified as he sings “I guess it would be nice if I could touch your body”"
Louis Theroux,quod erat demonstrandum
Louis Theroux,"Agreed 100% especially now that he’s doing channel 5.  All gas no breaks, while great, felt more like Tim and Eric than investigative journalism."
Louis Theroux,He did a couple of years ago. It's called Surviving America's Most Hated Family.
Louis Theroux,Yes
Louis Theroux,I love weirdos! Thanks
Louis Theroux,I'm interested! Thank you
Louis Theroux,he is now on Channel 5 on youtube
Louis Theroux,"I find Oliver a bit heavy handed, but I think he does a great job making dry English humor palatable to the average American."
Louis Theroux,I found AGNB about 3 episodes before it all went to shit and was beyond stoked when I saw my guy come back with Channel 5. Just ordered a hat from them the other day. Love Andrew's content
Louis Theroux,"Really? I’ve only found the first two, I’ll have to find it. Thanks"
Louis Theroux,There's no better man for putting weirdos at ease so they openly talk about their bizarre shit than Louis Theroux.
Louis Theroux,"John Oliver is far from dry I would say, he just shouts whatever formulaic analogies his writers came up with that week. I’ve watched a lot of his stuff, don’t get me wrong, but the jokes are very hit or miss and feel directed at housewives."
Louis Theroux,"And don't forget, X thing that isn't typically sexy, is actually *very* sexy.

I like John but I wish he'd hire better writers. The information bits are really quite interesting but the jokes are excruciating to get through."
Louis Theroux,"1) yes I would have preferred a more grounded documentary.

2) but I've already seen a Joe exotic documentary.

3) it's not an interesting or important enough subject to revisit"
Louis Theroux,Maybe we don’t spend an entire episode making his “Carol Baskin feed her husband to the tigers” case for him.
Louis Theroux,"Tiger King is one of the most unethical docuseries ever released. For all those people saying ""why make another?"" The answer is so that people can inform themselves of the greater issues that Joe Exotic represents without exposing themselves to the reality-TV-esque drama and manipulation present in the netflix series.

The after series ""special"" they put out, where Joel McHale jeers at and teases the victims of a morally depraved animal abuser and trafficker, perfectly captures the philosophy of that entire docuseries.

Instead of inspiring a sense of respect for the abused and trafficked animals equivalent to humans, the docuseries set out to make the humans zoo animals to be mocked and jeered at on social media. Anything would be an improvement than that."
Louis Theroux,This feels like his Scientology one where everyone’s moved on already and we probably won’t get any new reveals or whatever
Louis Theroux,"Prediction: Louis' documentary won't accuse, nor cynically edit the film in such a way so as to imply, that Carole Baskin is guilty of murder, because he actually has a scintilla of journalistic integrity."
Louis Theroux,Yeah. How about instead of trying to make Joe some folk hero we show the world what a pile of trash he actually is. He isn’t someone who should be imitated or celebrated. He is Donald fucking Trump if Trump wasn’t born filthy rich. A shitty conman who ends up in prison.
Louis Theroux,Any idea when this will be out? Love Louis.
Louis Theroux,"I find his revisiting episodes less interesting than the original ones. He is far better just doing half a story than going back and doing angsty handwringing over what he missed.

It takes the magic away when it’s an autopsy."
Louis Theroux,"As someone in the US
how can I watch this"
Louis Theroux,In case anyone isn't aware this is his second Joe Exotic doco. The first was about 10 years ago.
Tokyo Ghoul,My answer to this will always be Cowboy Bebop.

Just got into this show a week ago and I love it"
Tokyo Ghoul,"Some that haven't been mentioned.

[Soul Eater 01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzJ8U8OtEsE). I don't think I ever skipped it. It prepares you for the absolute insanity ahead.

[Death Note 01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8QE9cmfxx4s). It's made even better by the complete garbage that is 02. I refuse to even link it for comparison.

Four Naruto links and not one of them is the [original](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t__wczfpRI)? Come on.

[Hellsing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBPegoYoD9Q) is not my personal favorite but it deserves to be linked."
Tokyo Ghoul,"Paranoia Agent, Neon Genesis Evangelion, Record of Lodoss War (TV series not the OVA), Kodomo no Omocha, The Hakkenden, and the first first Bleach OP."

Tokyo Ghoul,"[Trigun](https://youtu.be/4OxFSy8G5wk) Every western cliché on top of some guitar riffs and quality visuals. What's not to love?

[Servant x Service](https://youtu.be/Zts5MJJQ9kM) Visually so much fun, sets the tone perfectly for a comedy about being in the service industry."
Tokyo Ghoul,"yu yu hakusho has a great opening theme, cowboy bebop, trigun, samurai x."
Tokyo Ghoul,"In no particular order:

Tokyo Ghoul,I really like the Noragami intros for both seasons
Tokyo Ghoul,"Michiko and Hatchin, Cowboy Bebop, Neon Genesis Evangelion, Ojamajo Doremi, Cardcaptor Sakura, Space Dandy, all of the Jojo openings, and Great Teacher Onizuka."
Tokyo Ghoul,"[BECK](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1URzwlqOL0)

Tokyo Ghoul,"Someone already mentioned *Cowboy Bebop*, so I'll submit *Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex* instead. 100% CG animation with a haunting theme song by Origa (RIP)."

[Never from Kaiba](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1i6PyyQq4k) Really great english lyrics from a Japanese singer"
Tokyo Ghoul,"Cromartie High School, and the show is funny as all hell too."
Tokyo Ghoul,Shocked to see that Promised Neverland is not here yet. It and Tokyo Ghoul s1 are my two all time favorite OPs
Tokyo Ghoul,"Some i haven't seen mentioned:

Black Lagoon op 1,
Tenjho Tenge,
Excel Saga,
Serial Experiments Lain,
Casshern Sins,
Michiko to Hatchin,
XXX Holic"
Tokyo Ghoul,"Second part of season 1 of code geass. Where they show different both Suzaku and lelouch taking different path, and inspiring other in their own ways"
Tokyo Ghoul,[Blood+ opening 3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sc4Q2E67U7w) will always be one of my all time favorites. Right up there with the Cowboy Bebop opening for me tbh.
Tokyo Ghoul,did fma brotherhood reuse a original series theme or did you just mean fma op4? cause I haven't gotten to watching brotherhood yet
Tokyo Ghoul,"Other than many already mentioned (Cowboy Bebop), I really enjoy both the opening and closing credits for Blood Blockade Battlefront.

Tokyo Ghoul,"Right off the top of my head
FMAB op 4
One piece op 1 , 5 and 22
AoT all the openings except for the calm song
Neon genesis Evangelion
Cowboy bepop"
Tokyo Ghoul,The original opening theme for Attack on Titan.
Tokyo Ghoul,Both OPM openings.
Tokyo Ghoul,"[Hyouka - OP 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Msuu3b-L-2k)

&#x200B;

I fucking fell in love with this anime. You want a wonderfully animated, low-key anime with endearing characters and a few interesting plotlines, watch it. I highly recommend it."
Tokyo Ghoul,"[Saint Seiya Hades Sanctuary Arc](https://youtu.be/GotGFk-0-O4), this song is beautiful"
Tokyo Ghoul,FMAB op 4 also has the best ending song. It completely hyped u up for the next episode. Great job by the studio
Tokyo Ghoul,"Pilot Candidate has one of my favorite opening themes of all time.

https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=CuNToaNBb1s"
Tokyo Ghoul,Elfen Lied. Such a beautiful piece of music.
Tokyo Ghoul, Kaze wo Sagashite -One Piece
Tokyo Ghoul,"[Toradora Opening 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3Xmzu0OtS8). So damn good.

Also you listed 3 Bleach openings but somehow missed [the best one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92TEcszkRBw). C'mon, man!"
Tokyo Ghoul,"I agree with those, though I like [Eureka 7 OP3](https://youtu.be/Tg7EQpMMUq0) best!"
Tokyo Ghoul,"I like Death Note 02.  I think it's sassy, and the Ryuk-with-apple shot slaps."
Tokyo Ghoul,Paranoia agent is definitely up there. The music plus the laughter just gives off this weird vibe that helps set the tone.
Tokyo Ghoul,"I ended up being disappointed in Paranoia Agent (the jealous kid episode excepted; that was brilliant) after previously loving Satoshi Kon's films, but it has the best opening of any TV show ever possibly."
Tokyo Ghoul,And the season one intro for spice and wolf
Tokyo Ghoul,i meant fma brotherhood op 4 like i said.
Tokyo Ghoul,so they reused an op from the original series in the newer show?
Tokyo Ghoul,oh shit you're right. this is from the og not brotherhood my bad. 😅

Top Gear: The Perfect Road Trip,Manifest really hits that sweet spot.
Top Gear: The Perfect Road Trip,"It's been a while, but CSI: Miami was exactly that for me. Such a terrible, bonkers show."
Top Gear: The Perfect Road Trip,Zoo. Hilariously stupid show.
Top Gear: The Perfect Road Trip,"Kyle XY. Very interesting premise, atrocious writing and even worse acting. But I stuck it out all the way through"
Top Gear: The Perfect Road Trip,"The 100. The plot just keeps one-upping itself in ridiculousness but I like to sit back, turn my brain off, and enjoy."
Top Gear: The Perfect Road Trip,Law and Order. Specifically SVU. I won’t stop.
Top Gear: The Perfect Road Trip,“24 with Jack Bauer” should be the name of the show
Top Gear: The Perfect Road Trip,Does reality TV count? The Salt Lake City variant of the Real Housewives franchise has some flashes of Jon Waters level camp brilliance. These ladies are batshit and also federal criminals.
Top Gear: The Perfect Road Trip,How to Get Away with Murder is one of the best for this. Not many shows get close to this. Pure soap opera
Top Gear: The Perfect Road Trip,"Suits. Watched it until season 3 in highscool. Just picked it back up and I'm into season 6, such tasty tasty garbage."
Top Gear: The Perfect Road Trip,"Eastenders, Coronation Street. Basically the uk soaps are top drawer in a terrible sort of way"
Top Gear: The Perfect Road Trip,"Law and Order: SVU. It's an alternate reality fantasy show set in a world where cops are competent and compassionate and the bad guys almost always get caught and sent to jail. Plus, Ice T is in it."
Top Gear: The Perfect Road Trip,"Oh man, I loved watching 24 just to see what crazy stuff the writers would come up with to try and top themselves.  Any other show I would have stopped watching, but for some reason with 24 I just said ""Come at me, show!  You can't go dumb enough to make me quit!"", and it was a riot.

The show ran 8 seasons (Edit: actually 8.5 seasons) and had 9 presidents.  That alone is freaking bananas.

Also, they needed a spin-off show that was just Chloe tasing people who annoyed her."
Top Gear: The Perfect Road Trip,"I've watched Hallmark movies because I know it'll be good and wholesome. Nothing bad will happen and everyone gets a happy ending. Even the ""bad guy"". Pure veg out and relax stuff."
Top Gear: The Perfect Road Trip,"Awkward. It was an MTV original, enough said. But I will be damned if I didn’t watch the entire series."
Top Gear: The Perfect Road Trip,"I just finished a rewatch of 24 - I think it’s so good it’s great haha

Mine would have to be Degrassi … it’s one of my favorites too."
Top Gear: The Perfect Road Trip,Burn notice
Top Gear: The Perfect Road Trip,Castle.
Top Gear: The Perfect Road Trip,Teen Wolf
Top Gear: The Perfect Road Trip,"24 was like cramming every single action movie idea ever conceived in a single show with a single man saving the planet 408 times, and I sure ain't got a problem with that because it was awesome"
Top Gear: The Perfect Road Trip,House M.D. rewatching it sober has opened my eyes to so many flaws but I love the damn show.
Top Gear: The Perfect Road Trip,"The poor guy has to go 24hours without eating, sleeping or going to the bathroom"
Top Gear: The Perfect Road Trip,"It’s Chuck for me

Every episode is more or less the same. Bad guys in Burbank, Chuck flashes, Morgan does something dumb and/or creepy, Casey and Sarah go on a mission to stop the bad guy, mission goes sideways and Chuck lucks his way into saving the day. 

But I fucking *love* the show and rewatch it every few years"
Top Gear: The Perfect Road Trip,"Cobra Kai is a ridiculous show, but I like it."
Top Gear: The Perfect Road Trip,Prison Break
Top Gear: The Perfect Road Trip,"Go search for ""the pilot of 24 if it was made in 1994"". I laugh until I can't breathe *every single time*

https://youtu.be/JMLH_QyPTYM"
Top Gear: The Perfect Road Trip,"Oh no!  Kim got kidnapped again!

*later season*

Kim:  ""I'm tired of getting kidnapped!""

there was a certain amount of self awareness that kept the show from being totally terrible.  I liked it, but I was ready for it to be done.  Now It seems I'm ready for them to bring it back...lets' do it again!"
Top Gear: The Perfect Road Trip,Once upon a time and scream queens both were so bad and I was obsessed with how bad they were
Top Gear: The Perfect Road Trip,Some of Jacks days were better than others. But you got to admit that show had every major actor of the early 2000s. It’s still watchable. If for nothing but Kim Bauer
Top Gear: The Perfect Road Trip,9:11 Lone Star. Cheesy acting and plotlines and dialogue with no subtlety but I love seeing what kind of accidents or natural disasters they’ll come up with and how its filmed/produced.
Top Gear: The Perfect Road Trip,"I loved 24. The whole hour per episode gimmick, while not at all realistic, was pretty cool."
Top Gear: The Perfect Road Trip,"Not sure if it fits 100%, but I can throw on [*MXC* and still laugh my ass off at the sophomoric humor.](https://youtu.be/3jeZwUP6fu0) Shit's great!"
Top Gear: The Perfect Road Trip,"Married With Children.

It's so sexist, stereotypical, but how they as a family are total losers somehow makes it all alright.

I like how surreal it is and that's very rare in live action sitcoms that survive.  That only usually works on shows like the simpsons 

And in the end, I still don't know why, I end up empathizing with every main character on the show."
Top Gear: The Perfect Road Trip,"Manifest 

pretty sure it was written to capture the Qanon audience but goddamn if Ben Stone is not one of the most amazingly ridiculous and over the top characters in TV, follow your callings people"
Top Gear: The Perfect Road Trip,"Season 5 was peak 24, and honestly was a good season of television. 

That said, [Scalia did use the show as defense for using torture](https://www.theatlantic.com/daily-dish/archive/2007/06/scalia-and-torture/227548/)"
Top Gear: The Perfect Road Trip,Criminal Minds. It gets dumber and dumber. They catch 100 serial killers a year in the act and the assistant directors all still want to shut the program down. Rossi got back together with all of his ex-wives throughout the series.
Top Gear: The Perfect Road Trip,"I don't think 24 as a whole deserves the label ""so bad it's good"". I'll admit for some of the later seasons, the writing isn't as strong and does get insane to the point where it becomes a little silly. But for the most part, the show is so intense and serious that I'm gripped by what's happening without feeling like it's campy.

Jack Bauer isn't some quippy action hero who's always doing the right thing and gets a happy ending, he's a no-nonsense tragic figure who's forced to do terrible things which causes him to suffer more loss than any character on TV. 

And while supporting characters definitely don't get the same treatment as Jack in terms of character building, there are some with pretty engaging storylines. Namely Tony, Chloe, Renee, Bill, etc"
Top Gear: The Perfect Road Trip,I love reality garbage like naked and afraid
Top Gear: The Perfect Road Trip,I love 24 and while I realise the first season is important I fucking hate the first season but love the rest.
Top Gear: The Perfect Road Trip,Gossip Girl..
Top Gear: The Perfect Road Trip,Riverdale. People complain about it all the time but it's an absolutely bonkers show that starts off as a teen crime drama and leads into... Well THAT
Top Gear: The Perfect Road Trip,"My BIL was A camera on ""24"", and nominated for an Emmy for it. He did all the handheld camera work."
Top Gear: The Perfect Road Trip,Dammit Chloe!
Top Gear: The Perfect Road Trip,"My only problem with "" 24 "" is kim. Other than that, it's a pure adrenaline filed show. Really top tier and one of a kind. Good acted moments.

I still remember the mid 2000s as a teen. Dexter, House , 24, Lost were the most talked shows. Was literally everywhere."
Top Gear: The Perfect Road Trip,"The Flash, specially last seasons. Buildup until you get an unbeatable enemy that is too fast and powerful to be defeated... Only to be defeated by the power of love."
Top Gear: The Perfect Road Trip,[deleted]
Top Gear: The Perfect Road Trip,The Strain.  So stupid yet awesome.  Also FBI.
Top Gear: The Perfect Road Trip,"I've heard some great things about 24 but it's extremely intimidating to approach, did it *really* need 200 episodes to go through its story?"
Top Gear: The Perfect Road Trip,"If we are counting reality tv, I love the first few seasons of The Simple Life with Paris Hilton and Nicole Richie. I still have the first season on DVD. It's not the realest reality tv but it makes me laugh.


Reality tv aside, the last few seasons of One Tree Hill are so bad that I had to just buckle up and enjoy the ride. The dog taking the heart meant for the transplant..."
Top Gear: The Perfect Road Trip,"Hey, what’s a little torture between friends and Toyota commercials?"
Top Gear: The Perfect Road Trip,Manifest. I was elated when Netflix picked it up. Anxiously awaiting the last 10 episodes!
Top Gear: The Perfect Road Trip,"24 is over the top, but it has some great shocking moments in it. That one in season 3 with Chappelle always sticks with me as the most shocking scene in a TV show."
Top Gear: The Perfect Road Trip,Psych. Severely underrated and hilarious.
Top Gear: The Perfect Road Trip,"Family Guy is a stupid show with mostly dumb jokes and stupid plots, but When it comes on, I can’t help but be entertained by the badness."
Top Gear: The Perfect Road Trip,2 broke girls. I own the whole series without any shame. I think the premise is funny. A few jokes are bad bad lol but I like the characters plus it has Kat Dennings and Jennifer Coolidge.
Top Gear: The Perfect Road Trip,Superstore
Top Gear: The Perfect Road Trip,Prison break easily fits this category. Starts off pretty strong but the show just gets more and more ridiculous as time goes on. Hilarious watch but you just can’t get enough.
Top Gear: The Perfect Road Trip,Walker Texas Ranger
Top Gear: The Perfect Road Trip,13 reasons why starts as a show about teenagers learning to take accountability for their actions and ends as a show about teenagers murdering each other and covering it up for their friends
Top Gear: The Perfect Road Trip,"The Secret Life of an American Teenager, possibly the stupidest show ever created that went on to inspire a generation of equally stupid shows about severe teenage drama"
Top Gear: The Perfect Road Trip,24 was a great “treadmill” show for me when I was training for a marathon. Lots of excitement and fun but you can also space off for 20 minutes and not miss a thing. I wouldn’t watch it if I wasn’t doing something else at the same time.
Top Gear: The Perfect Road Trip,The curse of Oak Island.
Top Gear: The Perfect Road Trip,The Blacklist. The soundtrack was so worth it until they lost their music supervisor
Top Gear: The Perfect Road Trip,He gets a hell of a lot of usage out of his cellphone given that **he never charges it.**
Top Gear: The Perfect Road Trip,"Yellowstone.  It started off great but with the ridiculous plot armor that all of the main characters have being able to survive everything from being exploded to shot 100 times, the cheesy one liners, the cowboy montages set to up-beat country music, and the writing make this show a train wreck my wife and I can’t turn away from."
Top Gear: The Perfect Road Trip,"24 may be the greatest binge watch series yet. Watched the first couple during the lockdown and it easily killed time. The opening couple of hours where he killed the suspect and cut his head off, all in the offices of The Company were such an attention grabber you couldn't help but be invested."
Top Gear: The Perfect Road Trip,Wrecked.
Top Gear: The Perfect Road Trip,"24 was my first real TV love. Then Lost came along and changed everything, but 24 is epic entertainment. Season 5 is it's grand magnum opus. In no way would I ever call 24 ""so bad it's good"". Bad take. ""DAMMIT!"""
Top Gear: The Perfect Road Trip,Van Helsing was fun up until the last season where the rubbish teeny actresses couldn’t carry the show but up until then it was very enjoyable.  I’m trying to watch s3 of Jack Ryan and it made me realise how crazy it was that 24 could remain entertaining for 24 whole episodes while I’m struggling with Jack Ryan after 3 episodes.
Top Gear: The Perfect Road Trip,Aqua Teen Hunger Force. Most episodes cause my brain to shut down within minutes and just go with the flow. It's so bad that it is meditative.
Top Gear: The Perfect Road Trip,"I'm rewatching Elementary with my partner right now. Almost always the same show with a slight twist. We like it though.

The other one we enjoyed for the same reasons was Scorpion....always the same drawn out storylines with multiple obstacles to battle along the way with huge sakes and they never fail."
Top Gear: The Perfect Road Trip,The first few seasons were never bad. They were great.
Top Gear: The Perfect Road Trip,Love 24. God bless Saint Larry *sign of the cross*
Top Gear: The Perfect Road Trip,"Just a memory really but I’m from the UK and we used to have an Aussie import drama called *Prisoner: Cell Block H* (it was just called *Prisoner* in Oz but we had ***The*** *Prisoner* already) set in a womens high security jail. Wow, it was awful, with dodgy scenery wobbling, questionable acting and complete with a really cheesy theme tune. And yet it was immensely watchable, gained a cult following and was required after-pub viewing."
Top Gear: The Perfect Road Trip,"Scorpion is absolutely dumb as hell & every episode follows the exact same formula. 45 minutes to shut my brain down plus the “comfort” of knowing more or less what’s going to happen, but still with enough excitement to maintain interest, makes it peak background noise or a go-to easy watch."
Top Gear: The Perfect Road Trip,"Most people around aren't old enough, or have forgotten ""24"" made binge watching a thing. People rented past season DVD's and watched the whole season 3-4 episodes at a time to get the most out of this show. It was kind of groundbreaking."
Top Gear: The Perfect Road Trip,"Season 2, minus every goddamn Kim scene, is absolute edge of your seat high octane TV"
Top Gear: The Perfect Road Trip,"Last Man on Earth. 
Will Forte’s character is soo cringey, but I can’t stop watching."
Top Gear: The Perfect Road Trip,The Chicago franchise. Typical Dick Wolf level acting and melodrama but it got mad addictive
Top Gear: The Perfect Road Trip,Burn Notice.  When I initially watched I was excited to see how the Michael plot would eventually play out but it's like that gif of the truck about to crash that never does; you just never get to the end of his story.  So with that out of the way it becomes another TV show about vigilantes that's pretty repetitive but still has some surprises.  The overall plot is just so stupid but once you get past thats it's just a good action show.
Top Gear: The Perfect Road Trip,"Burn Notice. It’s just so unbelievably bad, but I love me some Bruce Campbell!"
Top Gear: The Perfect Road Trip,Chicago Fire
Top Gear: The Perfect Road Trip,"24 was that show for a while. After there was another mole on CTU, I tapped out. They were out of ideas. Arrow, The flash were both until they became unwatchable."
Top Gear: The Perfect Road Trip,The Unit
Top Gear: The Perfect Road Trip,"Burn Notice. Horribly written plot, trope-filled video Valium. Great characters with good interaction and fun dialog. I've watched the entire series afew times."
Top Gear: The Perfect Road Trip,Burn Notice. So cheesy but so much fun. Bonus points if the episode teaches you how to make c4 out of toothpaste and cat litter or whatever.
Top Gear: The Perfect Road Trip,"""So bad its good""

its not a bad show, i dont get reddits obsession with saying ""its so bad its good"" on everything that isnt some emmy winning masterpiece (24 won best drama in season 5 by the way). 

yall have never seen real bad movies or shows have you."
Top Gear: The Perfect Road Trip,"I scrolled a good ways without seeing it, but I'm gonna add Vampire Diaries. I stopped a long way in just because I tried to watch the Originals at the same time and it was so tiresome I lost my momentum. But up to that point Vampire Diaries was great bad tv."
Top Gear: The Perfect Road Trip,Season 5 when he hijacks the plane is peak 24
Top Gear: The Perfect Road Trip,"As propaganda for the false idea that torture works and that both it and law breaking by the ""good"" guys go, it's mildly entertaining."
Top Gear: The Perfect Road Trip,"Jack Bauer. He 24, big hit"
Top Gear: The Perfect Road Trip,Doctor Who
Top Gear: The Perfect Road Trip,Virgin River
Top Gear: The Perfect Road Trip,Sons of Anarchy
Top Gear: The Perfect Road Trip,Family guy. Archer.
Top Gear: The Perfect Road Trip,"House. 

Every episode is the same and House never grows he's always the devil with a heart of gold. Selfish, arrogant, brilliant, and despite his worst efforts always takes the right hand path at the end of an episode.

He insults his subordinate's intelligence, misdiagnoses twice, then hits a home run because the patient ate too many bananas during the summer solstice or some shit.

I love it."
Top Gear: The Perfect Road Trip,Trailer Park Boys
Top Gear: The Perfect Road Trip,Do Monk and Psych count? Or Bones? Any network TV that was on in the mid 00's i guess.
Top Gear: The Perfect Road Trip,Burn Notice
Ultimate Force,"""I was supposed to be on a TV show this year but production got shut down""

""Oh, because of Covid?"" 

""Uh, yes. It was *definitely* Covid"""
Ultimate Force,This sounds like a 30 Rock joke.
Ultimate Force,Now I think I want a show about the making of this show. Someone like Tina Fey could make something hilarious like that.
Ultimate Force,Release the diarrhea cut!
Ultimate Force,Fun little story - had a friend get sick from Giardia after a camping trip. His little sister forgot the name of it but knew it started with a 'G' and so went around their church telling everyone her brother wasn't there because he had gonorrhea.
Ultimate Force,Poor Ron Funches
Ultimate Force,Shit!
Ultimate Force,Literal shit posting.
Ultimate Force,This truly made my day. Thank you for sharing. 🙏
Ultimate Force,It all flows downhill
Ultimate Force,So much for shit n slide.
Ultimate Force,"This is the funniest shit ever, it belongs on r/nottheonion"
Ultimate Force,"Even without the diarrhea, what a shitty show idea.

I guess it was probably cheap."
Ultimate Force,He’s honestly the only person I’ve felt bad for. Everything else is hilarious!
Ultimate Force,Thank you for sharting.
Ultimate Force,"Interesting, but I think you are missing a proper hook and reason to tune in for characters -- the world being the hook only lasts a couple episodes

One of the issues with alternate history media is that you really need a specific central character(s) that the audience can relate to as a newcomer so you can unfurl the world to new eyes, then you have to make them care about the characters who are playing this world out -- its incredibly difficult -- you need to set the rules and then tell me how they work and who I care about

Its ""easy"" to play world builder in alternate history, because you can simply make anything true, without necessarily needing real-world logic, but in the end, it has to be a  grounded story about people who happen to live in those times, and not about ""those times""

Background and overarching ""world"" plot arcs are fine-- but tell me the character(s) that I come back for each week.

(lastly, this would need to be non-ad supported, I can't see a lot of companies wanting to buy ads against this)"
Ultimate Force,"Have you ever seen the 2004 fake documentary *C.S.A.: The Confederate States of America*? That'd be a good place to start exploring your idea.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C.S.A.:_The_Confederate_States_of_America"
Ultimate Force,"Ideas are a dime a dozen. Until you write it, you have nothing."
Ultimate Force,This isn’t a fuckin fan fic sub.
Ultimate Force,Do you know why they didn’t make Confederate?
Ultimate Force,"So the United States is still a global superpower without all of the CSA states? Makes Abe Lincoln look like a dumbass for trying to preserve the Union when apparently he’d been better off just letting them go according to you. You don’t seem to understand how inflammatory of a statement that is and then you fail to detail what type of theme you are trying to explore or outright statement you are trying to make. Your idea is almost all about war plots and nothing about the cultural or thematic issues you would inevitably commenting upon with a story like this. What are you trying to say? The country is divided, sure, but what statement are you trying to make? You don’t really mention politics or culture and so this seems more like a war games fantasy. Which, to be fair, is less controversial than actually dealing with all the political and social themes involved in A Story like this, but also, why use these themes if you don’t want to address these issues?"
Ultimate Force,">hypothetical

We're only 2 years past a moment when white supremacists carrying the emblems of the CSA overran the US capital in favor of overturning the defeat of a white supremacist president. 

None of the ring leaders have been censured, charged, or convicted. Most of them are back in office.


Not a hypothetical."
Ultimate Force,It’d be interesting to explore present day stated as disputed territories.
Ultimate Force,Tbh I think the whole succession thing was just an issue because Benioff and Weiss were unpopular after the GOT finale. I agree it sounded like a concept that could be interesting
Ultimate Force,"Interesting. I like it.

I don't think the CSA would be as impoverished as you suggest. Agriculture would their #1 export/a profitable industry."
Ultimate Force,Harry Turtledove would be a great read for you.
Ultimate Force,"Agreed, I'm hearing a lot about events and plot but not a lot about people.

One of the best books in this genre is called ""underground airlines"" by Ben Winters, which has a really compelling main character - a former slave who hunts down other slaves in order to maintain his freedom. The background is great but the characterization makes it really compelling."
Ultimate Force,"HBO and D&D never addressed it again. The outrage was actually mostly manufactured, but regardless, the show was DOA from it... I actually don't think it was going to get greenlit anyways, but of course the reveal went poorly so it didn't matter"
Ultimate Force,"No, all I know is that they dropped the idea"
Ultimate Force,"What are you on about? 

The majority of the story is literally politics/geopolitics followed by spy intrigues and finally military actions (and even then it’s either a professional military fighting insurgents for most of the time up until the end where actual war between two industrialized nation comes to fruition). This is literally just an idea I thought up of after watching a short alternate history video on YouTube, obviously if I spent time on this I’d flesh out the cultural, societal, economic, etc. consequences of a Southern victory. 

>What are you trying to say? 

Again, literally thought up of the idea on the spot after watching a YouTube video yesterday. It’s not a multi-year project or whatever with solid, concrete ideas and themes fleshed out. But since you’re so inclined to ask, if I had to find a theme, it’d probably be analogous to the triumphant spirit of our country, doing what’s right (with “right” being defined in a morally grey zone), the internal logistics behind why major political decisions get made, how a war affects a country, etc."
Ultimate Force,Good question.  Why wasn't Ray Epps arrested and charged?
Ultimate Force,"I'm sure that was part of it, but there's also the optics of two white guys being the one to tell the story of an alternate universe where the South won."
Ultimate Force,"Particularly ""The Guns of the South,"" which is really the literary starting point for these sorts of stories."
Ultimate Force,Because it was a terrible idea.
Ultimate Force,Can someone please escort the Trump cultist back to r/conspiracy?
Ultimate Force,"What part of what I said is not factual?   Instead of addressing the question, you resorted to insults.   Socrates said that is admitting you have no valid argument."
Ultimate Force,"Paragraph breaks. They are your friend. 

Otherwise, it’s a wall of text that the reader gets no break from."
Ultimate Force,"Sorry I refuse to read that wall of text. Insert some paragraphs, then i'll come back to read it."
Ultimate Force,"I struggle to believe you didn’t see the “main” villain early on. I’m not sure spoilers are allowed but it became obvious to me when the mayor looked at an old photo of that fanatics family. It immediately clicked for me who was the odd one frequently showing up in every episode.

It took me longer to guess who the monster is as i initially guessed correctly until something happened to *allegedly* put the suspicious character and a monster in one scene; so I thought “nah my theory is proven wrong”. Until it wasn’t.

Tbf I didn’t like the last episode as much as well but only due to Wendy’s manner of confronting suspected killers with almost no back up plan (“please surrender, you have been exposed”).

So yeah, I’m sorry you missed the clues, doesn’t make the final villains “unassuming” and forced.

Also the guy who was initially arrested was shoved in our faces so hard, it was so obvious, anyone who ever read a detective or played a detective game knows it’s NEVER an obvious one."
Ultimate Force,"Completely agree, what a disappointing ending, absolutely cringe worthy and so rushed, i would have preferred an annoying cliff hanger rather than the outcome it had. Do not recommend"
Ultimate Force,"Glad someone else is complaining about the stupid direction they went with Crackstone. An undead telekinetic sorcerer waving a glowing stick around, yelling about killing all the freaks. You’re right, the last episode was like a kid’s show.

Another (petty) complaint of mine was with the Enid/Tyler fight scene. They’re by far not the first to do this, but I’m so so so tired of watching a creature with massive claws hit their opponent with the **back** of their hand/paw/whatever. I get it. It sends the person flying, prolongs the fight scene, keeps the fight sequence from getting repetitive, sometimes moves the fight to a new area…it’s a decent plot device, but it has always and will always look so fucking stupid"
Ultimate Force,"I agree that the final episode was a disappointment, but I have to disagree about the villains being random. It was kind of obvious that Tyler was the monster. Anyone who has watched any detective movies always knows it's not the first suspect. And besides Xavier he was the only other one who always seemed to be around for the monster moments. Also as soom as the Laurel Gates thing was revealed the redhead was kind of obvious, seeing as she was the only normie at nevermore, and her all round weirdness throughout the show. 

In saying that I absolutely hated how rushed the episode was, it seemed to just jump from scene to scene with little explanation of how they got there. The whole resurrecting crackstone thing was stupid and his death was anti climactic. Surely the redhead with all her poisonous plants could have figured out a more efficient way to kill off all rhe students at nevermore."
Ultimate Force,I agree that the plot ultimately disappointed.  I felt they could have thrown out at least one layer of red herrings and had one less episode.
Ultimate Force,"I agree. I was pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed it, until the last episode where there were so many elaborate magic elements and cliches crammed in that it twisted my head, but not in a good, puzzling way. 
It felt like it turned it into a kid's TV show, goosebumps or something, where the villain was like the cartoon network version of Vigo the Carpathian from Ghostbusters 2. It felt like it was meant to be a Scooby Doo type thing, but they didn't do it in a clever way. Very disappointing."
Ultimate Force,"The character you referenced as dying offscreen was shown as alive at the end.

I do agree that Xavier's repeated forgiveness was a bit much, but he did explain the final instance by referencing her taking the arrow for him (saving his life, again)."
Ultimate Force,"Not reading your paragraph, but I agree! Genuinely I don't care if the story is slightly bad or not, we have flaws even as a writer. But my god, the ending. Still a big fan but it was so rushed I couldn't manage all of that information.

Magic staff, ritual, Enid wolfing out and Weems getting poisoned. All of that crammed into one episode, and the staff or ritual wasn't foreshadowed to understand if it's relevant for the story. It was just... there.

I want a season 2 and redeem their reputation by making better mystery plot but at the meantime, I'll give it a 10/10 close to my heart :)"
Ultimate Force,"Damn this is exactly what I thought of it as well. I was just scanning the internet for someone who thought this same thing about the ending of the show. Thanks for this, now I know it’s not just me who thinks the whole last episode was completely rushed."
Ultimate Force,"I loved the 7th episode until they revealed Tyler was the villain coudn't agree more, if they hadn't made the 8th episode I think they would have spent less and the serie wouldn't have lost its charm."
Ultimate Force,"They also made Wednesday a pretty unlikeable character. Torturing a dude, even if your right is fucked up and wrong."
Ultimate Force,You binged this show in a day?
Ultimate Force,I can't wait for OP to watch 1899.
Ultimate Force,Worse than GOT?
Ultimate Force,I tottaly agree. The writers could've made this show into an amazing one but they decided to end it on a bad note. They could've made the ending much better by not having the last episoad
Ultimate Force,"I just want to say that I don't entirely disagree with everything you say here. I do think the Finale is pretty rushed, trying to hit all the character beats out of fear of there not being a Series 2 so that the show could potentially feel complete and as a result, it's incredibly crammed. 

There are a few things where our opinions diverge, however, and some of this post is just wrong. For starters, Tyler isn't dead. He's literally shown to be in the back of a prison van which is the last scene of the episode so not sure how you managed to miss that. Not just that but we do get some hints about Tyler's true nature. His attack on Xavier before the show started is mentioned at the Rave'N dance as well as the fact that he is never actually shown to be around when Hyde attacks when multiple other characters appear afterward as Red Herrings. He never has the same thing, the closest is after the Hyde attacks in the Gate's House and the next is that Wednesday's first vision of Hyde comes after Tyler grabs her whilst protecting her from the bullies.

Thornhill has a lot more teases though, Her boots being caked in mud when she first walked in because she was out in the woods and Wednesday gets her vision of Eugene being attacked by the Hyde because someone is holding her arm, guess who...Thornhill.

Weems dies because, it's to show that through it all even though she's been making mistakes that she really did care about the safety of her students including Wednesday, it's also to remove the safety blanket, with Weems gone and Thornhill being the woman behind the murders, there is no adult figure who offers any real safety for the Outcasts and whilst I do feel like it wasn't all that impactful as a Death Scene, it's an important shed of safety.

I do agree that Xavier is a bit too quick to forgive Wednesday but, it's clear that he does care for her as he is evidently shown to be remorseful when he gets angry at her whilst in the Jail cell and I doubt he wanted her to die even if he was angry with her for getting him arrested then not to mention that she took an arrow for him so it's not entirely unfounded and it seems clear at the end of the series that their relationship is not back to where it was with them seemingly agreeing to just be friends. (Something Jenna agrees with in interviews)

I do also agree with the Joseph Crackstone moment, it does feel like a waste of the build-up as it seems like it was being set up to be the big bad of the Series who would be dealt with near the end of the show and instead, it's crammed into an already busy finale. I would have rathered that what happened is that Laurel tries to resurrect him but, Wednesday and her group of Outcasts manage to stop her and Tyler before she can but they're still aware that their efforts may not have thwarted the Prophecy forever instead, we get what we do and he's defeated in all of 5 minutes, not to mention that we learn nothing about what happened to Laurel after Wednesday kicked her in the face."
Ultimate Force,"id say that the show fell apart in episode 5. but even before then, it wasn’t the best show i’ve ever seen."
Ultimate Force,"Thank you, absolutely agreed."
Ultimate Force,"I am sorry, but are you incompetent lol? There is literally no difference whatsoever, only that it looks different. You will still read THE SAME text, either with or without the paragraphs. Seriously, tell me what difference it would make... The value & the point of the post would be the same.   
God, I love when people complain about minor things just to complain, when you can't read text longer than 5 sentences, don't use Reddit."
Ultimate Force,it's not that bad.
Ultimate Force,it became obvious because they appeared frequently in the episode is not the same as there were real clues that led to those characters being the killers..
Ultimate Force,Exactly. Harry Potter already did that over 10 years ago. No need to keep doing this over and over.
Ultimate Force,I honestly just hate that trope with any type of detective show. They're so desperate to not make it the obvious suspect that they make it the person who makes the least sense. They throw in so many red herrings that it would honestly make more sense for the other person to just be the villain.
Ultimate Force,Another clue to the reveal of laurel gates was her trying to give Wednesday the Frankenstein book as it was obvious that crackstone was going to be resurrected with all of the body parts.
Ultimate Force,Not even just that. The plot was pretty solid in my eyes. What fucked it up was the scooby doo ass twist villains that made no sense at the very end.
Ultimate Force,"Also, people with huge crushes put up with a lot of crap. My husband and I used to be friends with this guy from my husband's work when we were in our twenties. He'd always bring this girl with him to dinner and parties and stuff and buy her nice stuff. It was obvious he liked her and they'd known each other since high school. When we'd ask if they're dating they'd always say they were friends. We'd see him heartbroken when shed date other guys. Anyway, several years ago by, and I guess she finally realized what was in front of her the whole time, an amazing guy who loves her, and they ended up dating, then married. But the take away is that he was treated like garbage pretty much for years and still stuck it out."

Ultimate Force,"I felt like a fucking pariah when I posted this. I genuinely couldn't find anyone else who shared this opinion. I may have been a little harsh, but I'm glad that someone agrees."
Ultimate Force,"Another thing is. They made the villain so random because they didn't want people to guess it, but in doing that, people automatically assumed it was the least obvious suspect. It would've been more unpredictable for Xavier to actually be the villain."
Ultimate Force,you say this as if it's a 22 episode show and not an 8 episode show. lol.
Ultimate Force,Yup. I was really hyped. It was shamefully disappointing.
Ultimate Force,Or got season 8
Ultimate Force,"Haven't watched it so I wouldn't know. From what I've heard, they both butchered the endings in the exact same way. Ruining every good aspect of it."
Ultimate Force,"This is pretty much my thoughts my thoughts as well, didn't think the twist villains were too random and actually thought it was a good surprise that made sense. But from the very moment Crackstone was resurrected, the pacing became wayyyy too quick. They were definitely trying to fit in too many things before the episode run time ended, and it just felt like a jumbled mess as a result.

You're probably right that didn't want to make the story feel too incomplete in case there wasn't a second season, but hopefully the success of the show will make the writers pace things a bit better in potential future seasons since they will presumably know when the very last episode of the last season will occur. Because it really sucks that the entire season was great until quite literally the last 20-ish minutes"
Ultimate Force,"ironically, your reply is more readable than OP's rant, even though all you add was just a simple enter"
Ultimate Force,"Paragraphs make things infinitely easier to read. There's a reason they exist.

https://www.quora.com/Why-is-it-difficult-to-read-something-if-it-s-not-broken-into-paragraphs

There's a good breakdown of the science of it in the top response here."
Ultimate Force,"Real clue 1: Hatred towards “mages” (whatever they are called, outcasts or freaks or something) as the main plot line. 

Real clue 2: Sus woman has NO magic but hangs out with mages despite being “not liked” by many colleagues.

Real clue 3: Family of the guy who obsessed over Mortisha. Hated mages. Allegedly everyone died or disappeared, conveniently.

Real clue 4: Newspaper, zooming onto the old photo.

Real clue 5: The old abandoned house of the same family. Everything leads there.

Real clue 6: Portrait of this family. Zoomed in. Especially on a blond chick.

Real clue 7: Same flowers as hospital; there are two suspects now?… or someone throwing a false lead? (Another well known cliche)

Real clue 8: Everything to do with the book she found and hydes.

Real clue 9: Hypno therapy.

…I’m just lazy to list everything but this is A LOT"
Ultimate Force,"Agreed, just because it's a film cliché doesn't make it good writing."
Ultimate Force,"(It also occurred to me that if a trio of townies can drive a tanker full of red paint onto the grounds and hook it up to the fire suppression system, our big bad could have skipped the tedious harvesting of 'ingredients' and occult ritual and just cooked up some toxic goo and fed it into the sprinklers.  (Would have been a short season, though...))"
Ultimate Force,She realized she was losing at playing the game of Hypergamy.  She'll always feel like she settled- and he'll know it. Bummer.
Ultimate Force,"You say this as if watching eight 45+ minute episodes in one day isn't a bit much. I mean, many of us have been there buuuut...it's still unusual."
Ultimate Force,"More like seasons 5 through 8.
Which of course do not exist and cannot hurt you.
Shame it only ended with 4 seasons."
Ultimate Force,"I suspected the red head early on when the dude with the bees died. 
Wednesday told the teacher during the first attack and second attack. 

Even so they could of done a better job because way more clues were pointing to the doctor.

 If there was some other clue like. 

""OH I love dr blah blah our green houses alway supply her with flowers for her patients."" -said by red head chick. 

Good twist happen when the clues are just subtle to miss them."
Ultimate Force,"I'd also list the fact that the Morticia fan's father knew how to make Beladonna poison. Seems like the kids would know as well, at least the daughter. Redhead worked with deadly plants.  


Also, it was a bit on the nose when Wednesday found out the monster was harvesting parts and she was offered Frankenstein as a reading material in the same episode I believe.  


Those all made the connection almost obvious, I was certain who was the controller last 2 episodes at least.  
Monster was a coin toss until the end."
Ultimate Force,"I agree the ending was dog shit the show had me hooked for like 5 ep then it all went spiral downward. I wish they didn't do the anti climatic killing by stabbing heart ending ,they could've left the story more open ended ,room to speculate ,more for the next season to expand upon"
Ultimate Force,"I mean.. 6ish hours during the holiday season isnt too crazy.    
That's less than a lotr marathon, an HP marathon, etc."
Ultimate Force,5 and 6 weren't that bad but definitely a decline 7 and 8 are rough tho
Ultimate Force,"I actually missed that line that she supplies the doctor with flowers; good pick up.

I’m glad bee dude didn’t die, he was great."
Ultimate Force,"I missed the plants clue and this detail about his father. The only thing which made him sus for me was reveal he goes to therapy.

re monster, I knew it cannot be the artist guy because it was painfully obvious. Classic detectives don’t work this way, it’s never the most suspicious person. The show also showed very well that Wednesday just gave up and forced his arrest out of desperation, making a huge mistake. This was neat. Then it was just a process of elimination."
Ultimate Force,She totally didn't. I made that up as an example of a clue they could have used. You didnt miss anything.
Ultimate Force,Having a near death experience does change you sometimes. I have no qualms with the ending.
Ultimate Force,"Massive cop out of a character.  Guy spends 20 years extremely nihilistic and depressed then gets high almost dying and suddenly you're hopeful again?

Such feelgood bullshit"
Ultimate Force,I will say I noticed when he started to cry it was the catharsis that Rust needed all along.  For some people it's a moment for others it's accumulation over a lifetime and some never experience anything akin to it at all.
Ultimate Force,"That's dwindling a complex character to a one note statement. 

Rust is the only one who never gives up on finding who did it and fighting what he sees as the evil of the world. He's just refusing to acknowledge what he's already doing."
Ultimate Force,"That's why I feel they rushed the ending. Even if he had a moment of revelation the character and audience should be given due process. Also, he went from darkest to lightest instead of a balanced transition. Sheer light isn't the balance to darkest dark. I agree with you, they tried to give it an uplift at the expense of the character's persona."
Ultimate Force,"Yup. Rust was damaged from his daughters death, but it was clear he felt some greater purposes at times. He completely loses his cool when that guy tells him they never found the Yellow King. He also is completely willing to cover for Marty when he realizes why Marty went rogue and shot the kidnapper. 

He's in a serious amount of pain and is coping with what happened in his life in a destructive way."
Ultimate Force,I loved that show
Ultimate Force,"I got to work on that show for a few seasons as the background Casting director. It was a hard show, out of all the shows I worked on probably one of the most demanding, but also one of my favorites as well. The cast and entire crew were really great, and the show was done really well!"
Ultimate Force,"On a related note, here is some unsolicited advice. Don't play poker with Kathryn Morris.  You. Will. Lose."
Ultimate Force,"I loved that damn show and it was available for streaming for a while for free, I think in the Roku app. It has disappeared from view. 

I appreciated the way it always handled the LGBTQ storylines."
Ultimate Force,"I fucking love this show. It's the best of the Bruckheimer-verse, even superior to classic CSI (seasons 1-6). Without a doubt the music made this show, introduced me to so many amazing songs and the end of episode montages frequently got my tear ducts working."
Ultimate Force,"One of my favorite shows. All the seasons are on HBO max, currently binge watching."
Fireman Sam,what the fuck?
Fireman Sam,Bob the Builder and Paw Patrol next!
Fireman Sam,"No but for real, can we talk about how Norman locked a kid in a pool changing room by super gluing the lock, then lit the pool building on fire? Because that kid almost died. "
Fireman Sam,Black Mirror theory: Pontypandy isn't real. It's just a piece of recruitment software to hire firemen from. Sam is a different trainee completing a series of tests. The results are broadcasted to inspire the next generation of trainees.
Fireman Sam,"I'm not sure if you've ever looked into it but becoming a fireman isn't very easy. How on earth did Elvis manage to pass all those tests. He barely scrapes by making the tea for the station manager.

Also norman is 100% an arsonist. He lights numerous fires weekly, I suppose the lack of police prevents his arrest though.

Another show that really needs to answer for itself is postman pat. He opens every single item he ever has to deliver and arrives late. Usually whilst running late he stops to chat with Mrs goggins. I have a theory that he is an eccentric billionaire that owns the town and pays those people to humour him, give him crazy tasks and always have something to deliver.

One last thing about kids TV shows. On Thomas the tank engine although the narrator calls him the fat controller and the engines do when they aren't around him, they never say it to his face which makes me believe its used as a disrespectful term against him behind his back."
Fireman Sam,This is the kind of trenchant analysis that is missing from my toddler TV time. 
Fireman Sam,"I’ve filed a Freedom of Information Request with the Health & Safety Executive and the Rail Accidents Investigation Board to get to the bottom of all the issues that seem to occur on and around the railways on the island of Sodor. So far I’ve had no response, but Sir Topham Hatt aka The Fat Controller is holding on to his job somehow... "
Fireman Sam,"There's a simple explanation to all this. 

Clearly Pontypandy is one of the few Conservative safe seats in Wales, and Dennis Norman is the son of the current MP for Pontypandy. 

Government funds are being allocated as hush money to keep the village going after the collapse of the mining industry, so they can pretend to run businesses and be a real community, while the MPs arsonist son has a place they can assign firefighters to keep an eye on him. 

Still, the cuts to the NHS are even affecting ambulance services in Pontypandy. That's why you have an unsafe vehicle. "
Fireman Sam,"Now, *this* is proper journalism."
Fireman Sam,"Kinda relevant, I know I'm now decades removed from being part of the target audience of this show, but it sort of makes me sad that [this](https://youtu.be/tDtlJU8e8v8) became [this](https://youtu.be/pqegkP92xcI).  
Same goes for Postman Pat, Noddy, Thomas the Tank Engine, Thunderbirds, etc.

Anyway.  
Great post, gave me a good laugh and sent me on something of a nostalgia trip on YouTube."
Fireman Sam,Brilliant! I am always saying that Norman Price is the only reason for the Pontypandy Fire Department to exist 
Fireman Sam,Norman must be imprisoned.
Fireman Sam,[deleted]
Fireman Sam,I had no idea what Fireman Sam was before reading this. I was picturing a Netflix original starring Dean Cain for some reason. 
Fireman Sam,"I think you've hit the root of the issues here. There's no other public services because it all goes on the fire brigade and the fire brigade is so well funded because the only person in the village who gives a shit is a fireman. 

Horrible tale of political corruption really. "
Fireman Sam,Does anyone remember Bertha? The robot machine that could make anything.

Fireman Sam,Norman should be in juvie by now
Fireman Sam,Im just so glad to see that im not the only one deeply disturbed by the deepseated problems of Pontypandy!!
Fireman Sam,Given its location perhaps Pontypandy gets some of its new fire and rescue equipment via EU grants. 
Fireman Sam,This is the best thing I've ever seen.

Bananas. 

In .

Fireman Sam,How might Postman Pat be getting affected by Greendale abandoning the high street and moving to online selling?
Fireman Sam,"OP hasn't got a clue about Wales. When ever we go anywhere we have a ""whip round for the drive"". The drive then sends this money to Pontypandy to ensure their fire service is kept in tip top shape.

Any shortfall is made up from TV rights and merchandise sales."

Ever since they [violated the Koran](http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-36900310), fundamentalist outsiders have used their ""Manchurian candidate"" Norman to start fires in the village.

2: Life-threatening emergencies never have consequences

Norman cops a smack around the ear-hole off camera for every offence, which is why he's so daft.

3: Equipment Quantity

Pontypandy is a central village that serves a multitude of nearby villages and fishing areas.

They used to be experts, but repeated smoke inhalation has made them stupid."
Fireman Sam,"This is some top quality OC.

Good job OP."
Fireman Sam,"Finally, somebody that's asking the real questions."
Fireman Sam,"Dennis Norman?   

Otherwise, very amusing."
Fireman Sam,"Alright so counter theory to help explain a possible reason for everything above. It requires a small bit of suspension of disbelief but I believe the above is realistic in the modern world without raising too many more questions. I'll go into detail about it, but I fear most of it will come off as rambling so skip to the end for the tl;dr. 

So if money is the problem, where can they get the money from then? Simple, they win it in the lottery. Some of you may already know where I'm going with this but to properly explain it, let me first explain how the Spanish do the lottery, in particular their Christmas lottery and El Gordo. 

In the early 1800's Spain redesigned it's lottery so that tickets cost an insane amount of money in order to deter the poor from buying them. It didn't work as people started buying them in groups and splitting up winnings by how much they each contributed. This meant that entire groups would end up winning the lottery at once. This lotto continued every year for over 200 years, including through the Spanish civil war and the forced relocation of the capital (where the lottery usually takes place). 

It eventually became common for businesses and groups to buy a ticket or even just part of one and then sell the shares on to individuals, usually through fundraisers so as to make a bit of profit. This is often what happens with the small towns that decide to buy a ticket and they often send people from door to door selling the tickets. This has ingrained itself completely in Spanish culture with estimates suggesting that over 75% of Spaniards buy tickets. 

Anyway with most important lottery in Spain is called the La Loteria de Navidad which means the Christmas Lottery. Held once a year three days before Christmas, the whole country basically stops working for a few hours in order watch and see who wins. There's also an interesting why they do the prizes but all everyone cares about is the biggest one called El Gordo. In 2017 this came out to be around €720 million, which needless to say is an insane amount.

Anyway to bring it back on point, in 2011 El Gordo was won by a small town, Sodeto, so that every ticket became worth around €100,000 and several holders in the small town becoming millionaires or near enough. There were still several thousand winners, but the number was quite a bit smaller than other winners for such a large amount. 

With so many in a town winning so much, one would think it'd go through some big changes, but according to several locals, on the face of it, it hasn't really. Heaps of things got updated and the council budget increased dramatically but for the most part, people seemed to just use it to improve things like irrigation and extensions to their houses. For the most part though they just continued their lives without having to worry as much about dept. 

Now I know that that the series is set in Wales, but I don't think it's too much of stretch to believe that they held a similar type of of lottery and that Pontypandy was one such town that won. And with a town of less than 30 people, less than 20 including the children, then it's easy to assume all the adults are millionaires. 

Such a situation could easily explain Pontypandy and where they get their money from. Not only that it can also explain how stores stay in business when there's very few customers as well as the residents' carefree nature as they don't have to worry about dept. Heck I'd even go so far as to say it could explain the bratty nature of a certain character in the show. 

I thank you for reading and hope you learned something. The place I first heard of El Gordo was [here](https://99percentinvisible.org/episode/el-gordo/). Certain incidents just stick with you and this one stuck with me for this moment. 

TL;DR - All the residents of Pontypandy won the lottery like what can happen in Spain which is where they get the money and some of their carefree attitude from. "
Fireman Sam,Teletubbies next 
Fireman Sam,You have a lot of time on your hands don’t you O.P ? ; )
Fireman Sam,"This ""OC"" is alarmingly similar to [this](https://www.theguardian.com/science/brain-flapping/2014/feb/07/fireman-sam-the-worst-childrens-programme-ever) blog article from The Guardian. Care to explain, OP?"
Fireman Sam,Is this supposed to be funny?  What a waste.
Fireman Sam,Not to mention that the residents of pontypandy are all white. And it's always a man who saves the day. And everybody else is helpless without him. From a socioeconomic point of view we banned our kids from watching this show. 
Fireman Sam,My *exact* reaction to Pontypandy's wild spending! Well put. 
Fireman Sam,"Paw Patrol...I have so many questions:

1) Why do only dogs talk?
2) Why do the adults think it's 100% normal to defer to a CHILD to save the day?
3) Where does Rider get the money for all those cool gadgets?
4) How do they live driving distance from a beach, the arctic, the jungle, and a ski resort?

My conclusion is that the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle mutagen leaked into Adventure Bay; it altered the environment and turned several children into adults (hence the mayor, cap'n turbot, etc) and turned a genius billionaire into a 12 year old (Rider), plus turned the town's emergency response and construction teams into dogs. "
Fireman Sam,"Why are Scoop, Muck and Lofty so ~~patriotically~~ pathologically scared of Bob discovering their latest mishap when Bob comes across as such a reasonable chap, just what terrible punishments does Bob mete out once the cameras stop rolling?"
Fireman Sam,Thomas next
Fireman Sam,What episode was this? 
Fireman Sam,Or Pontypandy is entirely funded by massive insurance fraud
Fireman Sam,"Norman gets away with it because he is Sam's illegitimate son. You see any other gingers in Pontpandy? His mum is still single and there's never any mention of a father. 

Sam was ball deep in Dylis Price at some point and lets Norman burn shit to the ground because he carries the guilt of an absent father.

That, or, there was a train run on Dylis by the firemen after a Christmas night out and they had a ""last one on is the father"" arrangement and now none of them are quite sure who is Normans father, so they all let him light the place up because of the guilt.

His arsonist tendencies are a cry for attention from the one thing he wants the most. His Dad."
Fireman Sam,"I love how in Thomas the Tank engine, the drivers are just resigned to whichever fate their engine chooses.

-

""Why aren't you back for tea, dear, where are You?""

""Thomas the Tank Engine - yes that's right, the train I drive - decided to fuck off to the main land by stealing some trucks. Now we've got a job in a steel factory and their seems to be no way out. Kiss the kids good  night for me""."
Fireman Sam,"> Also norman is 100% an arsonist.

Norman needs to be in jail. 

He makes me so mad I actually cant enjoy the stupid show with my kids "
Fireman Sam,"Actually around here, you don't HAVE to be a fire fighter to become deputy chief. My husband's department hired a guy who ""used to do some ems stuff"" and his last official gig was a wedding DJ. He lasted about 6 months and cost our stupid city a huge amount of money to buy him out and get him the hell out of here.

They have recently promoted my husband's captain to deputy chief, and things seem to be going much smoother."
Fireman Sam,I like the idea of that about the Fat Controller.
Fireman Sam,"if ye called The Fat Controller, The Fat Controller, he'd fuckin' *go* bananas... "
Fireman Sam,"I've done similar analysis for Daniel Tiger. 

That clock factory and the mandatory sleepovers at the King's are not the most questionable parts of the town."
Fireman Sam,"Trust me, you don't want to be looking into anything involving that godforsaken island if you value ever being able to have a good night's sleep ever again.

Do yourself a favour and let this go."
Fireman Sam,He can suck an apple though a hosepipe. And he knows just who to use it on. They'll never fire him.
Fireman Sam,"But Pontypandy is a mix up of Tonypandy and Pontypridd. Both are towns in Rhondda which is one of the most anti Tory constituency’s there is.

If anything this is a result of Labour increasing funding for public spending "
Fireman Sam,"Yeah, the originals were the best because they felt lovingly crafted, rather than soulless 3D models on a computer."
Fireman Sam,"Wow, the theme for the CGI version sounds like it has autotune, yuck."
Fireman Sam,"That Norman Price is a bad egg I tell you. 

I remember watching this as a young lad in the early 90s. This really brought back some memories. "
Fireman Sam,"Which is perhaps the reason that Pontypandy has no appetite to stop him. The OP ably demonstrated that the fire department are being given excessive resources for a town of that size, and surely a lot of that has to come down to Norman's fire-lighting tendencies. If they punish Norman the fires go away, if the fires go away there is no justification for the departments bloated budget, if the fire department loses its budget then jobs are lost and the peripheral businesses will have to close. Norman's arson is keeping the town afloat. They're trying to run the place on the broken window fallacy and its all going to come crashing down at some point. "
Fireman Sam,Someone has to support the backbone of the economy in Pontypandy.
Fireman Sam,Fucking Norman.
Fireman Sam,"It's been 28 or so years since I last saw the show, but I can still hear Norman's mum screeching his name whenever he does something wrong in my head."
Fireman Sam,"Absolutely, I loved it as a child, the world's most versatile factory. Then I looked it up later as an adult and discovered there were only ever about a dozen episodes! "
Fireman Sam,Or postman pat. When my daughter was younger this new SDS setup of his looked insane.
Fireman Sam,"It's a post-apocalyptic type scenario where most of the parents and capable adults have been taken from aliens and the kids and dogs simply cannot find them.

So now, the kids must make do with what was left by their super intelligent inventor Uncle, making it so the dogs can speak and are more capable than ever before.

They must keep this town safe and protected while their parents are far, far away.

Someone has to."
Fireman Sam,Shit posting requires a certain level of poor quality and lack of effort that this submission does not meet. :)
Fireman Sam,No that's if they'd been police instead of fire. 
Fireman Sam,"Pat took his redundancy, bought his own van and has set himself up as a parcel courier now"
Fireman Sam,Not necessarily. Too much effort.
Fireman Sam,"Yes. I grew up with it in the 80s, back when it - like Thomas The Tank Engine, Postman Pat, Charlie Chalk and more - were stop motion puppet based shows, rather than CGI abominations with no soul."
Fireman Sam,"Yeah, it's a formerly-claymation now-CGI show going back to the 80s about a fireman in a tiny little village. It's pretty charming for a kids' show and is big in the UK and Australia but as OP showed it's fun to mock as insane, a town of 20 people with *constant* massive fires and disasters and adults who have to explain everyday tasks to each other."
Fireman Sam,"The difference being, the OP is writing this for shits and giggles, while The Guardian is serious."
Fireman Sam,Small Welsh villages aren't known for being particularly diverse.
Fireman Sam,"Well that's not true. Penny the female Firefighter, the Floods - Mandy and Helen. Also Trevor! Ok not the most diverse town but its not some WASP enclave!.. I feel now I may watch this too much (blame toddlers!)"
Fireman Sam,Pretty sure that Trevor guy was black.
Fireman Sam,"Pontypandy is obviously heavily reliant on EU subsidisation and grants. Once Britain leaves the EU spending in the area will likely fall under the devolved welsh assembly probably still lead by the welsh labour party. With further cuts accompanying the EU withdrawal and the UK tax coffers being cut further with tory austerity, the welsh government will be forced to massively reduce Pontypandy's state given finanical life blood. with heavy job losses inside the fire department local businesses will see a reduction in spending and the area will fall by the way side like many of the welsh coal mining areas did in the 80's under thatcher. The young will move to cardiff or swansea for jobs while the older people will probably blame Trevor for taking their jobs."
Fireman Sam,"Honestly, the oversight from the local council and authorities here is astounding...

There are some more serious issues with fire department protocol (and Sam's behaviour) in Pontypandy, which I don't think were mentioned. 

Why is Fireman Sam driving a publicly funded fire truck to work every day? Perhaps you might think the theme is just a one-off, but the original Welsh version of the lyrics provide damning evidence: 

[""Pawb yn disgwyl ar y stryd, Sam yn dod bob dydd yr un pryd"" - translates to ""Everyone on the street expecting him, Sam comes at the same time every day""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvN34utjvmU). So this joker is driving the fucking fire engine to work every day, so he doesn't have to use his own car. What if there's a fire while he's asleep?

I would also question the gadgets he has installed in his house, to give him tea and put on his hat. Are these paid for out of his own pocket, or has he claimed them on council expenses?

Serious questions have to be asked here."
Fireman Sam,The only acceptable answer I can figure is that it's a Minecraft mod.
Fireman Sam,"Additionaly for paw patrol:

1)why hasn't the princess just put sweetie pie to sleep? Or punish her at any way at all? SHE KEEPS TRYING TO TAKE OVER. The throne, the crown. The dog wants to take. That. Princess. Down. And the princess just giggles ""oh silly puppy!"" NO BITCH THAT DOG IS EVIL

2) ryder is like 12. Where's his family?! 

And what about PJ Masks?

1)where the fuck are the parents? 

2)Who would let 3 6 year olds out alone at night with vehicles to fight crime?

3) who gave them the magic pajamas that gave them their super powers?

4) the Christmas eve episode Luna said she didn't have any family. That's extremely sad and brings up a million questions. Where is her family? What happened to them? Where does she live? Was she raised by moths?

5) where the fuck are the other villains parents? The ninja one has like a ton of ninjalinos. Are they real kids? 

6) speaking of villains, who the fuck lets 6 year olds become super villains?

7) how did they get their powers? Do they have evil pajamas? 

8) why is nobody else out at night? Where are the police?

9) Why are the kids never tired at school if they are up all night fighting crime?"
Fireman Sam,"Ryder is a terminally ill child at the end of his life in massive amount of pain. He has a massive love for dogs, as his family has eight different breeds of them. To counter Ryders massive amount of pain, and to give him some joy in life before his inevitable death, the doctors try out a new experimental pain relief in which the patient is fixed with neural implants that simulate a virtual reality world. 

In this VR world, Ryder is a local hero who helps save the day with his beloved pups. If he wants a new gadget, he just has to think of it - hence why the pups have an assortment if vehicles at their disposal, and Ryder has a land, sea and air paw patroller. The local town is small with only few recognisable faces, as Ryder is young and struggles to imagine a sprawling city with the needs and wants a city has. Instead he imagines a town with two of his favourite things: a bakery with lots of yummy cakes, and a place for his pups to get bathed and pampered. This town is only a short distance away from the places his parents took their dying boy to before the VR treatment: a ski resort, the jungle and the beach."
Fireman Sam,"It's clearly an advanced society where genetically engineered children and dogs are capable enough to take on these roles. Yet there are indeed adults that seem no more capable than average. Less capable if you consider the mayor's, who seem child like and foolish. I suggest we are witnessing a world devastated by a pandemic that has reduced the IQ of the population. Desperate to save it scientists, isolated from the virus, have engineered new individuals to keep society safe. Dogs are an obvious choice because they are not susceptible to the virus, yet need to be engineered to talk and use fine motor skills. The ethical and legal ramifications have also limited the number of children thus far produced to solve the crisis.

As for location... Extreme climate change caused all those issues. "
Fireman Sam,All this aside: THERE IS A COMFIRMED EXISTANCE OF 'MERMAID DOGS' that are able to use magic in conjunction with the moon

Fireman Sam,"yeah, the factory went under. Thatcher's Fucking Britain "
Fresh Meat,"I watched it not too long ago, though it was pretty average tbh. I think I even wrote a mini-review on here once, don't think i'll be able to find it. But basically, the series starts a bit bland, in its 2nd and 3rd seasons there were some good moments, some good enough to make me laugh [](#s ""especially Josie's dental training scene lol""), but there was never enough humor and the cast lacked chrisma. And then season 4 was just straight garbage (even though it had a wonderful final scene).

The show was never 'great', it pretty much walked the line between 'average' and 'good' before it fell off in its final season. I can't remember all the issues I had with it, but I remember one being their incapability to write plots for multiple characters at a time. It's like the writers just picked the ones they liked out of the bunched and tossed the rest to the side. season 4 especially was the worst when it came to this... I'm still mad at fuck at how they ruined Kingsley. I was also mad when Josie x Kingsley's *will-they-wont-they* relationship drama was the only long-term plot on throughout most of the series only for them to throwaway all that in season 4. Made the first 3 seasons feel like even more of a waste of time.

In my opinion, **The Inbetweeners**, **Skins** and **Skam** are better shows than Fresh Meat and i'd advise anyone to choose one of those over it. "
Fresh Meat,"It works as part of a ""British life experiences"" anthology series.

Start with Inbetweeners, then you move onto Fresh Meat, (optionally add Drifters in here as well), then finish it off with Peep Show.

For a more specifically Scottish ending to this situation, you can end with Still Game as well, for a decent summary of different stages of life."
Fresh Meat,The Inbetweeners is vastly superior to Fresh Meat.
Fresh Meat,I loved this show and Bad Education so much.
Fresh Meat,"Fresh Meat edges out Peep Show as my favorite UK show.
"
Fresh Meat,I love the Inbetweeners as well. I can agree with you on the Kingsley/Josie story. But I guess it adds a feel of realism to the story. In saying that I was hoping they would work their shit out and get together. 
Fresh Meat,Certainly funnier but I think Fresh Meat has a better story. I actually care about the Fresh Meat characters.
Fresh Meat,That show is GOAT
Fresh Meat,I'll have to add Bad Education to my list!
Fresh Meat,Haha oo that is a tough one.
Fresh Meat,"you should watch Skins. it's pretty much a classic right now and if it didn't exist there would be no Fresh Meat. It inspired that, and Skam too, which you should check out after, it's basically the modern-day Skins. "
Fresh Meat,Just skip the movie. Its bad and makes no sense. Also its bad. Did I mention the movie is bad?
Fresh Meat,Yeah I've watched Skins. Loved the first 6 seasons (didn't think much of that final season). It's awesome. 
Fresh Meat,Didn't even know there was a movie.
Fresh Meat,"I really like it, probably too much.

I've been waiting for the new series of Fresh Meat for a while now, it starts airing in February. Too bad it's the last season :(

(Better prepare for it now than find out when you've watched everything)

I hope a new similar series will take it's place and most of all, I hope the last series will be stellar. Instead of a lot of shows that know they are ending."
Fresh Meat,Have you seen The In-Betweeners?  It has one of the same actors in it and it is sort of a high school version of Fresh Meat.
Fresh Meat,"It's a British show, so I hope you don't like the show TOO much since it has a total of 6 episodes per ""season"" and only three ""seasons"" in the series (there is a fourth season premiering in February after three fucking years waiting, which makes 24 episodes total, or roughly twice as many episodes as your average British TV series).

Seems like the better a British show is the fewer episodes it will have. Common to have 6 - 12 episodes total before a show finishes. "
Fresh Meat,"I love this show. It was my introduction to Jack Whitehall, who is a complete riot. I was a bit disappointed that Netflix only added the first season, though. "
Fresh Meat,I started watching it because the Inbetweeners ended and now it's one of my favorite British shows.
Fresh Meat,"I just started it and I'm loving it.  I just wish they added more than one season considering its a few years old. I don't want to wait a year to see the second season that came out 6 years ago or whatever. Netflix had the same problem with the 3rd season of inbetweeners where it was absent for like 2 years after the show finished.
"
Fresh Meat,"LOVE Fresh meat, and am psyched that more folks will be able to see it. I can't wait for season 4. It's hilarious. "
Fresh Meat,Fresh Meat is absolutely excellent. Just the sort of British thing you want. 
Fresh Meat,"I just started it the other day and now I'm on season 3 and I love it.  I thought it would be some average show when it came up as recommended for me, but I have been blown away.  A 4th season starts soon"
Fresh Meat,"Love this show! So funny. Really liked the in-betweeners, too.
I'm bummed netflix doesn't yet have season 3- does anyone know why that is? Can you watch it elsewhere?"
Fresh Meat,"I liked it. It's not too serious and is better for it. Some great characters, and made me wish I had gone to University!"
Fresh Meat,I liked this show a lot when i watched it on hulu. We're getting a last season soon as well.
Fresh Meat,"The pub they use for filming this is very close to where I live, it's not actually in a student area (and it's in Salford, rather than Manchester, which is a bit like somewhere being *technically in New Jersey* rather than New York) but it's a pretty decent pub."
Fresh Meat,I have a thing for Kimberly Nixon so I always catch it
Fresh Meat,I finished watching it yesterday and really liked it.
Fresh Meat,"Can anyone explain to me why Josie really wanted to break up with Dave before she had sex with Kingsley, but shes had sex with 2 different guys in the episodes before? I don't know why her cheating on her relationship with Dave is so important all of a sudden."
Fresh Meat,8 episodes per season for the first 3. 6 in the upcoming one. 30 total.
Fresh Meat,On the other hand Peep Show has 54 episodes.
Fresh Meat,40 minutes run time with 8 episodes a season isn't bad. 
Fresh Meat,"my Netflix (in france) added all 3 seasons , they really only put the first 6 episodes in yours ?"
Fresh Meat,Can't freaking wait
Fresh Meat,Just watching that episode now. Probably wanted to do it for a while since long distance but just hasn't done it yet. Is usually how it goes. 
Fresh Meat,Isn't it because she really likes Kingsley?
Fresh Meat,I didn't even know there were more seasons so that's fine by me. I sort of assumed this was a new show but that doesn't appear to be the case.
Fresh Meat,Ah. That's good news then. Sort of.
Fresh Meat,It did run over a decade 
Fresh Meat,Ya in America that would class as 16 shows or have so many adverts it would be an hour and a half long
Fresh Meat,"Yep. I was hoping to catch up on the most recent season, but i guess I'll have to wait a bit longer."
Fresh Meat,If you like the actor who plays JP check out the TV show Bad Education that he stars in.
Fresh Meat,[deleted]
Fresh Meat,Looks like Janeway is breaking the Temporal Prime Directive again.
Fresh Meat,"Watched the first episode last night and wasn't expecting much, by the end I was in love. After watching the first two episodes, it's easily looking like the best show that Netflix helped produce so far. There are some familiar faces here and there, as well as a lot of great unknown talent, so prepare to say ""I know her from somewhere..."" a few times."
Fresh Meat,"I've seen the two first episodes and I like it so far.

""No touching!"" during the visitor scene made me laugh though. Arrested development has ruined me."
Fresh Meat,I hate you for posting this.  Decided to give it a go last night.  Next thing I know it's 1:30 in the morning and I have to get up for work in less than five hours.  So tired today.
Fresh Meat,"Almost done with it, the characters they introduce later are just as great as all the other ones. 


Edit: I've also been waiting a awhile to see Laura Prepon in something this good again. "
Fresh Meat,"It addresses some pretty heavy social issues (race, gender, sexuality and more) while delivering some decent dark comedy.  

It's not The Wire, but it's got solid acting, characters and drama.  I'm just about done with the season, and am not disappoint."
Fresh Meat,goddamnit and here i was thinking a new series of the tv show fresh meat was up
Fresh Meat,"it's quite good, currently watching and can't stop."
Fresh Meat,Loveeeeeeeeeeeee it! I watched 6 episodes yesterday and I figure I'll finish the show today.
Fresh Meat,I'm enjoying everything except Jason Biggs. I don't know why but every time I see his face I get angry. 
Fresh Meat,"Like most people here, I haven't been able to stop watching this weekend.

There's something about the way it's made that just makes me want to keep watching more and more and more.

I haven't felt this way about a new TV series for a long time. So thanks Netflix!"
Fresh Meat,"Love it also only two episodes in, but can't wait to keep watching. Any guys who are put off by a mainly female cast, don't be! It's really good and not just a girly show. "
Fresh Meat,"Great show, happy for Netflix."
Fresh Meat,[deleted]
Fresh Meat,"I must be in the minority.  After the first episode I did think it was a different take on prison shows but they ended up doing the same stereotypical story lines as other shows.  Bad guard, gratuitous nudity, no food, a stint in solitary (about where I stopped watching), seemingly good people in for bad things, budgets cutting inmate's privileges, smuggling stuff in, etc.  Plus the stories were just...stories.  Nothing funny, no reason to care about characters so the drama was blah, it just seemed so bland.  I've seen several comments about how funny some things were, I don't think I ever cracked a smile let alone thought something was funny.  Anyway, just my opinion, but I really don't see what all the fuss is about.  If this show was on Lifetime it'd probably be cancelled by now."
Fresh Meat,Yeah.  The Nun was a very interesting character.  And I was sad when I found out about why the hippie was there.   I ended up finishing it yesterday and its really good and I look forward to season 2.
Fresh Meat,Kate Mulgrew is what got me interested in seeing this.  
Fresh Meat,Even above House of Cards? They set the bar pretty high. Guess I will have to give it a watch.
Fresh Meat,"There's another ""No Touching!"" later on, and a Star Trek reference"
Fresh Meat,"Watched the first 6 episodes last night. Didn't get into bed until about 2am! I have to say, I absolutely love the show. Probably gonna finish up the season 1 tonight, as well."
Fresh Meat,Because he ruined that delicious Apple Pie. 
Fresh Meat,Him and Trent Reznor weirdly start looking like each other as they age.
Fresh Meat,"Yea, I wish they would have cast anyone else. My only minor complaint is him. I just don't like him. "
Fresh Meat,I've seen it said that it's specifically not that
Fresh Meat,"It really is nothing like Oz, other than it takes place in a prison. "
Fresh Meat,"I really enjoyed House of Cards (it was my replacement for Damages), but this is a lot easier to watch and doesn't require as much investment to understand what's going on. The writing is great, the cast is fantastic and the shows setting really helps them stretch out their limited budget.

To say it's better than House of Cards is subjective, but it's a nice surprise and shows that Netflix really knows what they're doing with their blind faith when greenlighting these shows."
Fresh Meat,"I really like HOC, didn't watch Hemlock Grove, because really?..but I definitely like this one more.  "
Fresh Meat,"Wait, he didn't eat the pie?"
Fresh Meat,"In fact, ""This is not like Oz"" (as in, you're not going to get shanked in this prison) was a line of dialogue in the first episode."
Fresh Meat,"The main character is a white person who has never been in trouble before(like Beecher) and each episode then concentrates on a new character's background and why they are in prison. It may focus and have more of a ""main character"" compared to oz, but I see it as being very similar. Also, it's not a bad thing, Jenji Kohan is a great writer and I like this series as much as I liked Oz."
Fresh Meat,"Ahh Vod has got way more character than Super Hans. I love the character but he's somewhat of a one dimension joke. Vod on the other hand is actually an emotionally vulnerable, fiercely loyal friend. 

She's got a fuck up mother who she's rebelling against by actually making something of herself. She is often the moral voice of reason, especially in regards to Oregon. She's kind to Howard in a way that none of the other housemates show when he fancies here.

I get that they're both drug abusing hilarious characters, but I think it's a bit of a disservice to Vod's writing to call her and Hans the same character."
Fresh Meat,"In terms of humor and drug usage probably, but Vod has some dimensionality to her character, Super Hans just does crack lol "
Fresh Meat,"Yeah I agree with what your saying, and I suppose my claim is a bit too simplistic. There are just so many instances when I watch Peep Show and Super Hans says something, and I think *God, I totally saw Vod at that moment*. Their delivery and body language etc is remarkably similar. "
Fresh Meat,"And what, just because he's working he can't smoke some crack? "
Fresh Meat,"Sorry for the 7 year late reply but I’m watching through fresh meat again and totally thought this! Did a Google search and this thread came up. 

Their mannerisms are so similar"
Fresh Meat,That's the problem with crack. It's so more-ish
Fresh Meat,Lmao did the exact same thing hahah
Fresh Meat,"I thought the final scene nailed what it's like to leave university.

There's also a deleted scene online from 3 months later that sort of deals with what you say about Josie."
Fresh Meat,Only on episode 4. Bingeee
Fresh Meat,"I loved this show start to finish. When it started I was just starting university, and the show depicted a surprisingly spot on and touching portrayal of what it is like for British students in those formative years - something I don't think has been done accurately before. I've graduated 3 years ago so the shows hiatus meant the Fresh Meat gang and I couldn't go through that together like we had our first through years, but nonetheless I think the show fucking nailed it on all parts.

Kingsley killed it this season. I really like that the show had the characters undergo serious development, but they were still ultimately all flawed individuals at the end. A crushing realisation all graudates must face.

Also it was great having the inbetweeners going through out sixth form and then fresh meat through university. I don't think any two shows have really captured British teenegagers like these two did. I'll miss you Fresh Meat."
Fresh Meat,"I've really enjoyed the series as a whole but I feel like the two year hiatus somewhat killed the momentum of the show when it came back. 
The deleted scene of three months later essentially showed that everyone mostly still lives together anyway. "
Fresh Meat,Thanks I'll have to check that out 
Fresh Meat,"Glad to see some other people are watching this, its a great show...josie is such a cutie..."
Fresh Meat,"""I hate you. I hate that you're on the other side of the wall. I hate the wall."" LOL"
Fresh Meat,I really liked it up until the London riots episode. I thought that one was terribly boring.
Fresh Meat,That horse scene in the latest episode is so sad. And great.
Fresh Meat,[deleted]
Fresh Meat,"OK, I'm watching the pilot right now and I don't see David Mitchell anywhere in the credits.

Edit: Also, can someone explain to me the appeal of the whole ""awkward"" comedy (as in Peep Show, the Office etc.)? It just freaks me the fuck out.

Edit II: ""in the credits"""
Fresh Meat,"I think it was really apparent in E6 that Oregon is trying to be trashy and  ""normal"", and Vod is just her idol in this sense.

Also I can really see affinity between Webb's character from PS and Oregon, which is cool. "
Fresh Meat,David Mitchell and Robert Webb didn't create Peep Show they just acted in it. The creators were Jesse Armstrong and Sam Bain i.e. creators and writers of 'Fresh Meat.'
Fresh Meat,Most excellent.
Fresh Meat,"This was a surprisingly enjoyable series.  We haven't had anything about people in Uni since ""The Young Ones"", and that's ancient now."
Fresh Meat,Anyone else thought that this was about Real World's Fresh Meat franchise?
Fresh Meat,I get it. I always hate when a show I like ends.
Fresh Meat,Enjoying fantasy doesn't diminish your reality. You just have to find the things you love in both worlds.
Fresh Meat,"I've watched like 4 seasons of Community in about a week because of this feeling.

Had to force myself to stop so that I actually deal with the life things that are piling up.

You're not alone man.  And yeah, I presume the answer is fixing your life."

Parades End,"ER, first 6 or 7 seasons"
Parades End,"That’s an awesome list! I’ve seen at least 75%... time to work on that 25%. Currently watching Catherine The Great. 

My addition to the list : Empire (2005), it’s set shortly after Rome and covers Octavius/Augustus rise to power."
Parades End,"Cheers, don’t know how I forgot that!"
Parades End,All this has happened before... [and it will all happen again](https://youtu.be/UmutRqkMx3g?t=278)
Parades End,Both
Parades End,"Thanks, there are some great suggestions there. I left the last ones off the list because although I understand where you’re coming from I feel like if I start including contemporaneous shows (or shows that are of a time rather than about a time) then I could, by that rationale, have to include nearly every show ever made that wasn’t science fiction. I’m not sure I’ve explained myself very well but I know what I mean!"
Parades End,"Thanks, I’ve never heard of Centennial. Was it good and is it available anywhere? Covering 170+ years over 26 hrs is quite the feat."
Parades End,That is one I always thought I should make the effort to watch but to my shame for some reason it just hasn't happened yet.
Parades End,The Accursed Kings sounds really interesting. My instinct is that the original version rather than the remake would be the one to watch but I don't know how available that would be.
Parades End,"Thanks, there are a couple on there that I’d seen and completely forgotten about. I included The Crown from it’s start date but will leave the end date until I know how many seasons they are going to do."
Parades End,"Thanks, I've added both of those."
Parades End,Many thanks for these suggestions and I have done my best with adding dates. I had never heard of the Chinese and Korean ones and it's a part of the world that is under-represented on the list due to my ignorance. I bet there are loads more to discover.
Parades End,"Thanks, I’d somehow never even heard of Empire. Would you recommend it because the reviews seem mixed?"
Parades End,"I get that, that makes sense."
Parades End,"It had some 70s cheese to it, like miniseries of the time had. Not to mention plenty of filler (back in the days when episodes aired weeks/months apart and needed constant clip recaps). But like most of James Michener's novels, it was also a really good generational story chock full of history.

Use to be on YT, not so much now."
Parades End,"I've never watched the original version, but I do know it has an excellent reputation (according to critics, and also to my mum who had a big crush on Bobby d'Artois as she called him).

I did watch the second adaptation and found it to be great fun. Funny thing: the books, though historical, were a huge inspiration for GRR Martin's fantasy. But conversely, the second adaptation came out relatively shortly after the LotR films and was somewhat influenced by its fantasy aesthetics. The director made few efforts towards historical realism when it came to costumes or set, and instead leaned hard into a fantasy-inspired look. Bold move on her part but it paid off pretty well, as far as I can remember. Edit: oh and the cast was fantastic. Gérard Depardieu in a small but important role, Jeanne Moreau chewing scenery as Mahaut d'Artois, Philippe Torreton as Robert..."
Parades End,"You'll have to look up the years, but Alias Grace, Underground, Manhattan, Swingtown, Halt and Catch Fire.

And probably lots of Jane Austen adaptions."
Parades End,Halt and Catch Fire and Valley of the Boom would be good to add for the 90's internet boom era.
Parades End,"I’ve seen it forever ago in Latin class so I mostly remember thinking “that’s baby Emily Blunt!”, but if I loved it I’d remember it I guess..."
Parades End,I’ve seen the original described as the “French I Claudius” and I guess you can’t really get much higher recommendation than that. The updated version is available on YouTube.
Parades End,I'm very surprised to see that The Americans gets ZERO nominations. Keri Russell and Matthew Rhys are both fantastic in that show.
Parades End,Can we retire Modern Family?
Parades End,"I know it's not fair to all the actors, but I really wish they had a cap for shows like Modern Family so they didn't take up five of the nominating slots. 

Also no Jessica Walter for Arrested Development? That's a bummer, Lucille absolutely makes the show. "
Parades End,"Parks and Rec should be nominated for Comedy
Also /u/iuy78, loved the ""Satan Himself"" part you added to big bang theory"
Parades End,"How do you even choose in the outstanding writing for a drama series category?!


Breaking Bad - 'Dead Freight'

http://entertainment.time.com/2013/07/18/online-series-house-of-cards-makes-emmy-history/"
Parades End,"Peter Dinklage shouldn't have been nominated this year.  Not because he was bad, but because his character didn't have enough to do.  

Corey Stoll, Peter Ruso from House of Cards should have got that nomination.  "
Parades End,No Shameless? *Really?* Emmy Rossum fucking killed it this season. Every year it gets snubbed and every year I'm surprised.
Parades End,"Mostly went as I expected, some exceptions (full noms here http://www.emmys.com/nominations)

* Orphan Black completely missing, expected at least best actress

* Can't believe Downton Abbey is still getting nominations, it's sticks out quality-wise compared to the other best drama noms.

* Vera Farmiga was a surprise, I didn't like Bates Motel but she did do a good job. Connie Britton was also a surprise in the same category.

* Not too much of a surprise, but no Arrested Development for best comedy :(

* Modern Family actors still over represented in the comedy category -_-

* Parks and Rec remains criminally snubbed 


What I'm happy to see:

* Big nominations for House of Cards, my favorite new show and validation for the Netflix method of distribution.

* ""Rains of Castemere"" up for best writing

* Lots of Veep nominations. And Top of the Lake!

* Bill Hader in best supporting actor, he does so well on SNL I'd love to see him get it over the Modern Family guys again."

Parades End,"Forever mad on behalf of the amazing Tatiana Maslany.

Also Hannibal, for both acting and cinematography, but mainly Tatiana."
Parades End,"I am completely surprised that Corey Stoll didn't get a nomination. He stole every scene of House of Cards.

I'm disappointed John Noble didn't get a nomination too. It definitely wasn't the best season of Fringe (he deserved it most for season 3 or 4), but he's been long overdue. It's not a surprise, since Fringe was never on the Emmy radar, but if anyone deserves a nomination, it's him."
Parades End,"Comedy was pretty predictable, a bunch of stuff I hate plus a bunch I like most of whom got nominated last year. Weird that Arrested Development didn't get nominated but I kind of agree. Drama was bad though. The Americans got 0 nominations and they missed the best acting performance of the year in Orphan Black's Tatiana Maslany. Justified missed out too, are we sure the Emmy voters know FX exists? Maybe they'll catch those shows in the supporting actor nominations but I doubt it. 


You should probably post the list of nominees in the OP as soon as it becomes available. EDIT: I can see you took screenshots, even better. They've got the other categories up on http://www.emmys.com/nominations now."
Parades End,I think the shows that I like should win.
Parades End,No Arrested Development ... Come on!
Parades End,Tony Hale!
Parades End,"Some thoughts.

* Cannavale and Dinklage nominated in the same category. Both of them worked together in one of my favourite films *The Station Agent*.

* Both Chlumsky and Hale nominated for Veep. Both are great additions in their respective categories.

* Walter and Arnett as well as the other supporting Arrested Development actors are snubbed. Shocking.

* Corey Stoll snubbed. FUCKING SHOCKED.

* Laura Dern nominated for Enlightened. Very deserving.

* 30 Rock comes back strong with two writing nominations and a directing nomination. Krakowski is back in the race, and she's arguably the favourite to win in Supporting Actress, Comedy.

* Stonestreet and Cryer won last year, but BOTH were snubbed this year. A pleasant surprise personally.

* Adam Driver gets his first nomination. Also a pleasant surprise.

* New Girl COMPLETELY shut out for its stellar second season. Ugh.

* Maslany not getting in, while the likes of Connie Britton does.

* Potter not getting in over the likes of Emilia Clarke, Christina Hendricks and (the worst offender of all) Morena Baccarin. Emmy voters voting with their dicks, clearly.

Pretty surprising nominations all-in-all."
Parades End,"Copy-pasting:

**The obvious, clear, unforgiveable snub:** Tatiana Maslany.  Seriously, what the fuck?  That should've been a tap-in.  Honourable mention to *Hannibal*'s cinematography.

**The obligatory ""let's throw a bone to movie stars who are gracing us with their presence"" nomination:** Kevin Spacey.

**The ""at least they had enough sense to nominate this"":** *Louie*.

**The disappointing, if understandable omission:** Everything to do with *The Thick of It*.

**The ""they still find that funny?"" nomination:** Matt LeBlanc.


Well, it's your usual Emmy fare.  Some really baffling choices, and some really great ones.  Might as well be positive.  Laura Dern! Adam Driver! Jane Krakowski! Emilia Clarke! Jonathan Banks! Anna Chlumsky!"
Parades End,"Awesome to see Bobby Cannavale get a nom for his role as Gyp, who I think was one of the best characters of the year. Same to Jeff Daniels, would have liked to see both Newsroom and Boardwalk Empire get a few more noms though. "
Parades End,"The Modern Family over-representation is getting nuts. I certainly feel like it deserved some nominations here - this last season was a significant improvement over the ""decent"" Season 2 and the ""sitting-on-our-laurels"" Season 3. But we seriously don't need to nominate the entire damn cast, every damn year. Ty Burrell deserves it every time; it deserves an Outstanding Comedy nom; you could definitely make a case for Ed O' Neill. Leave it at that. 

Nick Offerman's continued snubbing will forever go down as one of the Emmys' most laughable mistakes. Right up there with Jason Alexander not getting any for Seinfeld. "
Parades End,"Anyone else think Kiernan Shipka deserves a nom for playing Sally Draper on Mad Men this year?

She was out-acting John Hamm in some of their scenes."
Parades End,"I'm not really sure about Kerry Washington's nom for Olivia Pope in Scandal... everything about the acting and writing in the show is sooo melodramatic and over the top in a soapy fashion. 

Also, Hannibal snub for cinematography? :( Also, no Justified or Archer? "
Parades End,"Though Dexter has gone downhill quite a bit from the first four seasons, I was hoping to see a Supporting Actress nod for Jennifer Carpenter. Not that any of the nominees are bad, but Carpenter really shone last season and has been this season as well. "
Parades End,"How the **fuck** did Nikolaj Coster-Waldau not get a nom for supporting actor? 

I loves me some petey dink but a) he won already b) his character was not nearly as crucial this season as jamie...which was a performance that got knocked out of the fucking park."
Parades End,How the hell can Sofia Vergara get a nomination but Nick Offerman cannot? I understand it's different categories but literally all she brings to the show is a character who yells lost in translation english....
Parades End,[deleted]
Parades End,"Random, but is anyone else really upset there was no nomination for Rob Lowe in Behind the Candelabra? Everyone I know said his performance was insane and brilliant. I honestly forget Scott Backula was in it. How did he get the nomination over Lowe?

Two more minor gripes. Dinklage is clearly ridding off of his acclaim in the previous two seasons. Not that he wasn't good, but his character was mostly absent this season. I thought Michelle Fairley and Nikolaj Coster-Waldau deserved noms over Dinklage.

Also no cinematography nom for Hannibal? I expected it to get shafted everywhere else despite Mads increasing US presence, but come on. This show's cinematography is on the next level and it deserves to be recognized. "
Parades End,The median voting age for the Emmys is 62.
Parades End,Was Always Sunny shafted along with Archer or am I missing something?
Parades End,"Not much variation with the programmes in the drama section, where is Justified, Hannibal, SoA, etc?!?Happy Veep has lots of nominations yet Parks & Recs still gets less nominations than Modern Family. Also, glad that Bobby Cannavale is getting the recognition he deserves with two nominations, he can do comedy just as well as drama. In my opinion, Elizabeth Moss deserves to win for Top of the Lake, Louie has to get best writing in a comedy series, Dead Freight for best writing for a drama series, Jon Hamm for best actor, really can't call supporting actor (i'm biased so I would say between Paul, Banks and Cannavale), I hope Anna Gunn gets at least 1 Emmy with her run in BrBa.

Edit: re-thought some stuff."
Parades End,the big bang theory and modern family really lowered their standards with their newest seasons. i really can't agree with their nominations. 
Parades End,Only one nomination for Boardwalk Empire? That is disappointing. 
Parades End,Charles Dance definitely deserved a nomination and so did Michelle Fairley and Nicolaj Coster Waldau 
Parades End,"I feel there's one big mistake the voters made.   Nothing to do with personal feelings, 'I like X more than Y' type stuff.   

But if you are going to recognize House of Cards in so many categories, including Best Drama Series (!), then I don't understand how Corey Stoll isn't nominated for supporting actor, when his character Peter Russo was really the heart of the show in Season 1.
"
Parades End,"New Girl was the best comedy on television this year and it got nothing.

Lennie James gave *the* best single guest performance on television this year (The Walking Dead -- ""Clear"") and wasn't nominated.

John Noble never got a supporting actor nom for Fringe. Tragic.

Jennifer Carpenter should have been an automatic nomination for Dexter.

Nothing for Justified. 

No Corey Stoll. 

Enough of fucking Alec Baldwin.

With all of that said, there were just too many good shows/actors/actresses this year for everyone to get recognition. And with THAT being said, it's just an award show, it's basically meaningless, so why am I complaining.
"
Parades End,[deleted]
Parades End,"Nikolaj Coster-Waldau & Michelle Fairley definitely deserved noms. I think Spacey has this in the bag for best actor. The pilot episode for House of Cards, assuming that's the episode he put forward is just superb."
Parades End,[deleted]
Parades End,No love for Boyd Crowder :(
Parades End,"You know every year they say that the Lead Actor for Drama Series is stacked, but this year's nominations are fantastic. Honestly, I wouldn't know who to vote for (if I had a vote)."
Parades End,"As far as comedy goes, I become increasingly certain every year that the people picking these nominations watch little television.   Or at least, less than they should for picking these awards.  Modern Family and Big Bang are drowning in awards even though fans complain about a massive drop in quality.  Hear similar things about 30 Rock although it started much better than the former two.  Always Sunny has never seen any kind of nomination.  Chris Pratt and Nick Offerman should be nominated for supporting actor basically every year.  Yet Parks just get Poehler, and while she is good, the show itself and other actors deserve it more.

I knew before reading the noms that Poehler and Cheadle would get lead nominations without their shows getting nominated.  These nominations just seem very formulaic without having much to do with what happened in this past television season.  They probably didn't even watch all the new Arrested and just tossed Bateman the nomination.  The show itself, Cera, and Arnett are much better nominees based on this past season.  But you couldn't know that without seeing it through the end."
Parades End,"I was secretly hoping that Orphan Black would get a nomination but I know it is a stretch. I was never worried about New Girl until now. It's clearly the next big frontrunner in comedy and no nominations? Are you kidding me. 

The only good surprise was Bobby Cannavale. Damn, he stole the whole series in one episode. "
Parades End,"Nice to see The Office finale get a nod for writing. The Office hasn't been good in awhile, but that episode was the perfect ending for the show. I couldn't be happier with it."
Parades End,"I doubt she has much of a chance, but Vera Farmiga (Norma Bates - Bates Motel) really impressed me - the character could've become cartoonish but she handled it very convincingly."
Parades End,"Article on emmy snubs

http://whatculture.com/tv/7-actors-that-shouldve-been-nominated-for-an-emmy.php"
Parades End,'Girls' star Lena Dunham still looks nude in her picture. Shocker! http://www.emmys.com/nominations/2013/Outstanding%20Lead%20Actress%20In%20A%20Comedy%20Series
Parades End,"Snubs I feel strongly about, along with the nominees they should have replaced: 

- The Good Wife & Hannibal should have been nominated over Homeland, Downtown Abbey, House of Cards.
- Enlightened, Happy Endings, Parks & Rec (don't think Venture Bros. was eligible this year) should have been nominated over Modern Family, Girls, The Big Bang Theory.
- Tatiana Maslany should have been nominated for Orphan Black over Michelle Dockery in Downton Abbey."
Parades End,Can someone explain to me how Big Bang Theory gets nominated year in and year out? I just don't see what makes that show so critically acclaimed. Parks and Rec and Arrested Development are superior in just about every way.
Parades End,"No Michelle Fairley, no credibility."
Parades End,SHAMELESS deserved some recognition man!
Parades End,"The supporting actors on Parks and Rec deserve nominations, particularly Adam Scott as Ben Wyatt. "
Parades End,Tina Fey and Alec Baldwin absolutely deserve to win their respective categories. 
Parades End,"Why are we nominating the butler from Downton Abbey despite the fact he practically does nothing and has no scenes of any value? Better yet, why are we nominating him over extremely excellent actors like Michael Cudlitz, Nikolaj Coster-Waldau and Corey Stoll? 

Still, at least the Khaleesi got a nomination. I never expected that but it's awesome that she has."
Parades End,"I asked this question to many people last year, and I fully know the answer, but:

Why is it that Peter Dinklage considered a supporting actor in Game of Thrones?  He is pretty much the main character of the series.  I think modern, nuanced television shows have started the invalidate the distinction between Supporting and Lead Actor awards."
Parades End,"I feel like Simon Merrels (as Marcus Crassus) for supporting actor in Spartacus:War of the Damned should have been there. He was an incredible actor to watch this season.Also, a nomination for Jennifer Carpenter on Dexter would have been nice. Not that she would win, but I feel she should be in the running"
Parades End,Why do you have PBS next to Downtown Abbey when it was made by the British ITV?
Parades End,"I wish that Stockard Channing got a nod for Guest on The Good Wife. But I am so, so, so excited about Diana Rigg! "
Parades End,"No Orphan Black, Fringe, Justified, Southland.. Yeah frack the emmys. "
Parades End,"Good to see the love for American Horror Story. Season 2 was so different from season 1, but awesome in its own ways. Also good to see Vera Farmiga get a nomination, she's great in Bates Motel.

Also, I think it's telling that these Emmy nomination posts always have a bunch of comments complaining that Community was snubbed. CTRL+F'd for Community in this thread, found nothing. Yeah, season 4 was shit."
Parades End,Keri Russell deserved a nomination as much as Emilia Clarke or the others.
Parades End,"Such a joke..

Girls? Really? "
Parades End,How did Dinklage get the GoT nomination?It wasnt even his season.It should have gone to Nikolalj(Jamie) or Danse(Tywin)
Parades End,"Eric Stonestreet and Jon Cryer, who won best actor and best supporting actor, not even nominated."
Parades End,"I believe this is the first year that Mad Men doesn't get the most nominations. Breaking Bad had 14 while Mad Men had 11. Also, very glad House of Cards was able to earn 9. Way more than I anticipated."
Parades End,Do people really think that The Big Bang Theory is still funny?
Parades End,so is Dexter just completely being ignored now or did I miss it?
Parades End,American Horror Story....REALLY?! I didn't even watch the final few episodes. That entire season was just a tweaked out mess: LET'S CRAM AS MUCH SUPERNATURAL/HORROR PLOT TWISTS/DEVICES AS POSSIBLE! Aliens? Check. Possessed by the Devil? Check. Ghosts? Check. Serial killer? Check. Mutants running amok? Check. Angel of Death...? Check. Homicidal Santa Claus...^whatthefuck ? CHECK!...

Its Funimation thats doing the whole production. Cartoon network is like partners with them hence why a lot of anime they show on there is license through funimation and haven't always been the greatest of quality. So i'm a little skeptical how they'll play it out. Steven Blum (spikes voice) is prolly more likely going to be involved he's like their Johnny Dep.   
*fun fact if you watch the Halloween special of Regular Show he voices a character name Techmo that's dress up as spike from cowboy bebop. 
"
Space Dandy,"If [Steve Blum](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0089710/) voices the protagonist, I'm gonna lose my shit."
Space Dandy,It's Cowboy Bebop starring Zapp Brannigan? Shut up & take my money!
Space Dandy,"[Here's the second trailer!](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-Hz0DRrKLA) Though, it's more of a music video for the song Viva Namida by Yasuyuki Okamura."
Space Dandy,Lupin meets Spike Spiegel meets Spaceman Spiff? I'll be tuning in.
Space Dandy,It's looks like a cross between cowboy bebop and lupin the 3rd.
Space Dandy,Can anyone tell me why the fuck is my country not allowed to watch a mere trailer?
Space Dandy,Toonami was my best friend back in the day and I still watch it even though it's a shadow of its former self. Nothing can beat 2003 Toonami.
Space Dandy,"This looks awesome, Shinichiro Watanabe is the man."
Space Dandy,"Shinichiro Watanabe always delivers! 
Cannot wait!"
Space Dandy,Yayyy Cowboy Bebop meets Hale Nochi Guu!!! Hahaha looking forward to the randomness :P
Space Dandy,"A series called *Space Dandy*, set in space, created by Shinichirō Watanabe? I think... I'm going to watch the fuck out of this."
Space Dandy,It will also be on the Funimation website for streaming.
Space Dandy,Isn't toonami a programming block for Cartoon Network? I thought adult swim was also a programming block....
Space Dandy,[What's your favorite thing about space? ^^^Mine ^^^is ^^^space.](http://www.portal2sounds.com/191#w%3DCore%25201)
Space Dandy,"I can't wait for this crazy shit. My husband doesn't get it, I get it. "
Space Dandy,"For those who don't know, this will be the first anime to air in the United States before it does in Japan."
Space Dandy,"Finally, a reason to *actually* watch the toonami block.

They have some great anime on there now, but it's a real bummer to see anime that's at least a year old. You don't get the same build up of excitement when you're watching re-runs."
Space Dandy,"Will definitely watch this.

Good anime has been few and far between since the days of Ranma and Cowboy bebop."
Space Dandy,"After seeing that video, this is the only thing I can say: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBJZwYpHUBo"
Space Dandy,"Dear Toonami,

We miss you :(

Love, England"
Space Dandy,"It is me or there are serious Lupin III vibes on this one? Which means that I will probably end giving it a chance, just for the sake of being dissapointed over their innability to finish a goddamned series. "
Space Dandy,Can't wait for this! I really hope the soundtrack for Space Dandy is as sweet as Bebop/Champloo's.
Space Dandy,The uploader has not made this video available in your country.
Space Dandy,Adult swim is the only reason I want cable 
Space Dandy,"Oh God it's like Zapp Branigan meets Spike Spiegel.

Hells yeah I'll be watching this."
Space Dandy,I am going to watch the shit out of this!
Space Dandy,I must know what that last song was I can't get it out of my head!
Space Dandy,This reminds me of a strange cross of redline and cowboy bebop.
Space Dandy,so much hype for this show (already loving the soundtrack). I can not wait! The character reminds me of JP from Redline :O. I hope this show doesn't become like stardriver though x_x
Space Dandy,"I like anime and boobies but i hate Ecchi, lot of turn on moments but isn't good fap material."
Space Dandy,You had me at the tri-boobs and quad-boobs
Space Dandy,"""..dandy guy in the space."" ""..in the space."" ""...the space."""
Space Dandy,Space Ace? http://www.filmonpaper.com/site/media/2011/05/SpaceAce_onesheet-3.jpg
Space Dandy,"Nice animation, but too many boobs. Lots of boobs usually means not much plot. I watch anime for the plot."
Space Dandy,"Finally!! Some new programming for Toonami that looks awesome! Can confirm, will watch the hell out of this!"
Space Dandy,I always wondered what it would be like to watch Cowboy Bebop while tripping out on acid...
Space Dandy,"Lets say that, Cowboy Bebop, Star Fox, and Adventure Time had a three some and in that experience they had a love child that they had to take care of. Space Dandy would be that child. "
Space Dandy,"Would watch if I could.  Turner and Cable One are fighting over channel fees.  Therefore all Turner channels are either offline or replaced with something else.  Where Cartoon Network was, there is now the Game Show Network....the horror."
Space Dandy,"Did anyone else think this was an anime version of [this?](http://www.ignitumtoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Spaceman-Spiff.png)

i'm loving the art"
Space Dandy,"oh. no wonder it looked like a Cowboy Bebop, Lupen the Third, Samurai Champloo love child. looks good, can't wait."
Space Dandy,I'm surprised no one has made the [Tek Jansen](http://imgur.com/gallery/EOF4Wk1) (from the Colbert Report) comparison yet.
Space Dandy,Awesome!! Starting in January on Toonami. Looks incredible.
Space Dandy,"looks pretty awesome, especially considering BONES made it. can't wait to watch it!"
Space Dandy,"Jesus, I haven't heard the word Toonami in like a decade. Hope they bring back the DBZ Reboot line up too."
Space Dandy,[deleted]
Space Dandy,"""space dandy is... a dandy guy in the space"" that right there is a fucking glorious sentence. "
Space Dandy,[deleted]
Space Dandy,"I fucking hate anime trailers. Random shots with just music audio. Tells me nothing about the series. Even so, this looks pretty awful. No focus, lots of sexism, stupid looking protagonist."
Space Dandy,i work late nights i wished i had a dvr to see toonami =(
Space Dandy,why the fuck does he have an x on his chin???
Space Dandy,This is what I hate about anime trailers. Playing a song over clips of the show tells me nothing about the show.
Space Dandy,As much as I love the shows they have on... I wish they would finish a series. I don't think I've seen them ever finish one.
Space Dandy,Pretty sure Toonami is separate from Adult Swim.
Space Dandy,"Wait, Cartoon Network decided to start showing cartoons again?"
Space Dandy,"Yay, finally a LGBT show on Adult Swim, oh no wait, just a show with tons of Alien boobs.. meh. I figure a show called Space Dandy best have some sort of Homosexual. DON'T STEAL OUR WORDS JAPAN!"
Space Dandy,"Oh, thanks for this!"
Space Dandy,"Thanks.

I will never understand why Adult Swim of all organisations still pull this shit, as if we can't just use a proxy like this."
Space Dandy,Did you now that your username (without the first 'x') is also approximately the average power consumption per person worldwide in 2008?
Space Dandy,and Samurai Champloo!
Space Dandy,"It shows. I had no idea but the entire time I was thinking ""i hope this scratches that cowboy bebop itch""
"
Space Dandy,I got the vibe immediately.
Space Dandy,It's like brunette Johnny Bravo in space.
Space Dandy,"no, this is the first anime to be aired in NA BEFORE Japan, think about that :OOOO"
Space Dandy,"going into Redline was basically ""What's this movie abo- UNTZUNTZUNTZUNTZUNTZUNTZUNTZUNTZUNTZUNTZUNTZUNTZUNTZUNTZ...
I didn't know what was happening, and I didn't care, the music and visuals were too damn good..."
Space Dandy,"I cannot be convinced this is not related to the Redline universe.
I mean, that' so clearly Sweet JP and the same aliens in the movie"
Space Dandy,"Also [Dead Leaves](http://myanimelist.net/anime/974/Dead_Leaves) and [Trava: Fist Planet](http://myanimelist.net/anime/1980/Trava) ... All three are Takeshi Koike on key animation, so they all have a very similar look, which is akin to a double dose of acid and angel dust."
Space Dandy,"sheeeett, i thought dead leaves was already an acid trip"
Space Dandy,"Not saying it was bad, but I expected a better ending to Redline. (just watched it)"
Space Dandy,"wow, that looks fucking amazing "
Space Dandy,The music reminds me of Dynasty Warriors. Which is a good thing.
Space Dandy,"Beat me to the post
"
Space Dandy,"didn't really like that movie.  
definitely acid trip though."
Space Dandy,"Dude, for months they had an ad on [as] where they go 'toonami is back'. How did you not know? "
Space Dandy,"It came back on May 26th, 2012 due to high demand and Mike Lazzo being a glorious man, [which happened after adultswim pulled an april fools ""prank"" by switching out the usual Saturday lineup (and their usual april fools prank) with Toonami.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUYHDGZU4Uc) They've come a long, long way from where they started (barebones budget, small selection of shows, little promotion, etc.).

Right now it starts at midnight every saturday, and when Space Dandy comes it'll start at 11:30. Here's a recent lineup promo: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qrds7dnBak4"
Space Dandy,"> Techmo

> Spike

> in way similar

are you trippin balls mate?"
Space Dandy,Came here to say this.  You'd think they would have more than one go to voice actor by now.  
Space Dandy,"I think it's coming close to that caliber very quickly. Rome wasn't built in a day, after all.

Also, I'd argue that 2000-2002 was Toonami's prime, but I do remember the years with YuYu Hakusho and Kenshin most fondly so I'll give you that."
Space Dandy,"Toonami was removed from Cartoon Network in 2008. It came back as an adultswim block in 2012, still having the same feeling and packaging as the old Toonami but having the added benefit of little to no censorship.

Also, Adultswim is now its own network, they just share a channel with CN."
Space Dandy,"I don't know there have been plenty of worthwhile shows that have come out in the recent years. FMA:B, Clannad, Welcome to the NHK, Toradora, Bakemonogatari, Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya, Mawaru Penguindrum to name a few."
Space Dandy,There has been some good stuff since then. Have you seen Gurren Lagann?
Space Dandy,"Cannot agree with this statement. It is true that there are many anime's that take the cutesy harem generic story but there are A LOT of fantastic directors and writers out there with the drive to make fantastic anime.

Here you go.

•One Piece
•Hunter X Hunter
•Fate Zero (don't go near Fate Stay Night)
•FullMetal Alchemist Brotherhood (stay away from the regular one. Many claim it is good but that is false, they just watched it when they were young and have nostalgia thing to it)
•Psycho Pass
•Kill La Kill(Most popular anime from this season)
•Death Note
•Kids On The Slope(by cowboy bebop  creator)
•Gurren Lagann
•Monster (This is Storytelling at its Greatest)
•Hajime No Ippo 
•Kuroko No Basket
•Yu Yu Hakusho(it is a classic. If you have not watched it you are doing yourself a disservice. The author currently works on Hunter X Hunter when he can. He is sick)
•Jormungand (if you want crazy military action)

I can go on and on. If you need a roadmap I recommend starting with Fate Zero. The first episode is slightly long and a lot of set up but once you get through you are going to thank yourself.

Oh and if you are in the mood for reading manga go read Berserk."
Space Dandy,I think we're just getting old. 
Space Dandy,"People who say this obviously don't watch much anime. In the past decade, or even past few years, a lot of anime considered better than Cowboy Bebop have come out, such as FMA:B, Steins;Gate, Clannad, etc. I don't even think Cowboy Bebop is that great, I don't see why it gets the praise it does."
Space Dandy,"I think there's a mirror further up in the thread. As far as I know, Adult Swim/Funimation only have the distribution deal for the States."
Space Dandy,"The song is called ""Viva Namida"".

Hope this helps!"
Space Dandy,"I don't know man Tri-boobs are the giddy spark of youthful fantasies from the recesses of my long past pubescent memories generated by Total Recall. Quad-boobs however are the reminder that some things are meant as a feeding station for a litter of offspring. So Tri-boobs for the win, but more than 1 extra and I start see udders. Still will watch this if I can find the time. "
Space Dandy,They are Rebooting Reboot.
Space Dandy,"DBZ is impossible for them to get, and quite frankly I think its had its time in the sun anyway.

Reboot's is getting a new show, however."
Space Dandy,Yes this thread was a great marketing strategy.
Space Dandy,sup son ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯
Space Dandy,[removed]
Space Dandy,Don't blame Adult Swim for it. The promotional video was posted by Funimation. 
Space Dandy,"It looks like it's Funimation's channel, not Adult Swim. Funimation are the company responsible for importing and translating the series, i think."
Drifters,No waaay
Drifters,I hope they get Disasterpeace to do the soundtrack for the show too. 
Drifters,This is one of my favorite games of all time. The art and musical direction is absolutely incredible; I can't wait to dive into this rich world again. 
Drifters,"My god this could be amazing.

I hope they try to keep the atmosphere from the game though -- the ""story"" of which was told entirely visually.

Something like a (more) neon, futuristic version of Samurai Jack's quieter episodes."
Drifters,"While initially exciting as I really love HLD, I'm concerned that it won't translate  well. One of the best aspects of the game is that there is no dialogue and all story and world building is done through exploration and a few cryptic cutscenes. Regardless, hoping this one works! "
Drifters,If the art is in anyway similar to that of the game it is going to be visually stunning!
Drifters,"Honestly I'd have never expected this. I *love* the game, but it's not a secret that the narrative is a bit illusive. Like it is very much there but it's not explicit. Colour me excited."
Drifters,If they do this... will they do actual legible VA or keep it in its archaic language? I’m really hoping the latter if this comes to fruition 
Drifters,Does this mean that's it's in the same multiverse as Castlevania and Devil May Cry?
Drifters,So much potential
Drifters,He needs to slow down. He just announced DMC the other day lol
Drifters,"I don't know anything about Hyper Light Drifter but watching Castlevania, I couldn't stop thinking how well Brandon Sanderson's works could be adapted into an animated show. 

Especially Mistborn. "
Drifters,I am so excited for this. One of my favorite games of all time is now getting a TV series.
Drifters,"Holy shit!! That’s awesome!

i presume there’s not gonna be any dialogue?"
Drifters,Ohh this could be really good 
Drifters,"Wtf, that's something I never knew I wanted until now"
Drifters,holy crap this is the best thing I've heard all day
Drifters,"please be good, pleassssssssse be good"
Drifters,Played for 30 mins and dropped it. Is the story that interesting?
Drifters,"I would love to see the protagonist look at his map and say, ""This is garbage."""
Drifters,That game is fucking awesome
Drifters,My mind will be blow if it looks half as gorgeous as the game. Insanely hyped 
Drifters,"I thought it was rumored they were gonna give Metroid a go. Probably would be more excited for that, but it is funny they are making a narrative out of an atmospheric game series and instead of Metroid they just went full tilt with HLD. Very excited regardless"
Drifters,ya the IP is too rich to be left alone
Drifters,"Very cool. would never have guessed, pumped for this to come out!"
Drifters,"Weird game to adapt, but he did such an incredible job with Castlevania that I support Adi Shankar on any project. "
Drifters,FUCK YES! 
Drifters,HOLY SHIT! Thats amazing. I hope they manage to capture the unique feeling the game had.
Drifters,Wait what?
Drifters,Weird. but not unwanted.
Drifters,"Hate Adi Shanker as a person, but he makes some interesting things nobody else would"
Drifters,"...

The FUCK??





Well... Alright then."
Drifters,Maybe they can tell the stories of all the other heroes you robbed of their weapons and capes and keys.
Drifters,"Castlevania was fantastic, hope they aren't stretching themselves too thin picking up all these other projects."
Drifters,Yoooooooooo
Drifters,Please be like season 1 of Castlevania  season 2 was...not good. IMHO. 
Drifters,"Oh man, his work on FEZ was incredible as well. That'd be dope if they could bring him in for this. He isn't a stranger to doing more Hollywood work too since he scored It Follows and Triple Frontier (TIL! I had no idea he did that film). Fingers crossed!"
Drifters,"Fuck yes. The game is some atmospheric very much because the music mixes with and illuminates the general aesthetic so brilliantly.


Looking forward to the TV series but also I'd really like if they could somehow retain that feeling of mystery and enigma that the game has."
Drifters,"His music is sooo good. It works both as a perfect score to the game you're playing and just as a good listen.

He's also an interesting interview."
Drifters,100%. I like all of his work but that soundtrack is really something special.
Drifters,"The art and the music were amazing...rich world though? There's almost nothing to it. You could explain all of the lore and plot in a single sentence. And I almost feel like explaining it more with a TV series is going to ruin the magic.

The game leaves you to fill in the blanks, which makes it feel mysterious and other worldly. Telling you whats going on can only make it worse in my opinion."
Drifters,"Oh my god I would love this

Also happy cake day!"
Drifters,Samurai Jack
Drifters,"The “Bootleg Multiverse” is just the branding of Adi Shankar’s video game adaptions. It doesn’t actually mean that the shows are tied together, and there is no guarantee that there will be any crossover. "
Drifters,"Think less mainstream and more highbrow.

Post Editorial: Just realized those are same producer. Carry on..."
Drifters,"No, absolutely don't play it for the story. The story is even lighter than Dark Souls in every sense. The best bits of lore, which are legitimately interesting, are locked away in walls you have to decipher manually (or read online). There's good themes and interesting concepts that are hidden away so much its a better experience to read it on a wiki.

In my opinion there's a limit to how vague you can be with your narrative while still being engaging second to second and HLD completely missed the mark.

That said the art/sound/gameplay is top of the line so it is still worth playing it for that. Hopefully the show will adapt the narrative to be more engaging in the way Castlevania did."
Drifters,How dare you have a controversial opinion! 
Drifters,"just want to throw this out as a huge fan of his work on fez and in it follows, that triple frontier score is one of the most generic ones i have heard in a film in a while. really surprised he had it in him. i really don’t take it to be any indication of his future work, however."
Drifters,"I feel like the same could be said of Castlevania, too, but they absolutely knocked it out of the park there. If they handle it the same way, I'm on board."
Drifters,Thank you!
Drifters,"A rarity, tbf. I share OP's concerns, this is a show that should be silent, like the game.

It'd be like adapting Journey onto a TV show. once the characters talk, boom, the magic is gone and it is only a pale imitation of the source"
Drifters,"Adi Shankar is also a dipshit who’s ‘bootleg’ series is a fantastic kind of laughable.

He’s a good producer though. "
Drifters,[deleted]
Drifters,No kidding. 
Drifters,"Sometimes it's the direction he's given. He could have been pushing for something amazing, and the directors, who ultimately have final say, could have made him strip away at the music until it was what they wanted and not what he wanted. "
Drifters,"Well if you are talking original Castlevania, maybe. But the sequels had plenty of stuff to draw on for plot. Named characters with actual relationships between them for example. Also...it's just Dracula with a couple of tweaks man. There was a shit tonne of stuff from outside the game to draw inspiration from. They could have basically made any kind of Van Helsing type deal, called it Castlevania and it would have worked. 

Hyper Light Drifter barely even has a premise. In fact does it even have a premise? There may or may not be an apocalypse and some really tall dudes are vaguely involved, some of which might be responsible for said possible disaster. That's literally the ""plot"" of the entire game.

I can't help but feel that all this show is going to do is make the game feel less special."
Drifters,[deleted]
Drifters,"They did say in the article that they were exploring just about every possibility, including making it wordless."
Drifters,Just because you don’t take the time to get to know the story doesn’t mean it’s not good. 
Drifters,"Yeah, I guess to be fair I haven't played a lot of later Castlevania games, true they have a definite story and characters but at the end of the day the story is usually ""Dracula's back, get 'im!"" isn't it? I think Hyper Light Drifter is intentionally vague and mysterious and let's you sort of make assumptions about the world and the story, so I could see that giving the creators a lot of creative license to tell a cool story without worrying about it fitting in to an established story or anything. They told a good standalone story with Castlevania that wasn't tied to telling the story of a specific game, I could see this giving them more freedom to do that."
Drifters,"It's similar in that there is no dialogue, that's the only comparison I was making"
Drifters,Would be dope!
Drifters,[deleted]
Drifters,"> ""Dracula's back, get 'im!"" isn't it?

[A brief breakdown of Castlevania's plot](https://castlevania.fandom.com/wiki/Castlevania_Timeline).

Hyperlight drifters I can't even find summary of. So I'll write it. Judgement steals Jackals power. Judgement destroys some stuff. Jackal sends the drifter to get it back. He gets it back. The end.

That's literally the plot, I'm not skipping over anything. There's a bit of a difference between the two in terms of depth of source material."
Drifters,"Imagine the majority of players praising the story but since you think it takes too long to know the story it is now shit. 

I’m glad that you are an expert on literature and decide what’s good or not though, much appreciated. "
Drifters,"I think you might be misunderstanding my point. I'm definitely not saying Hyper Light as a game has as much story as the entire Castlevania series. I'm not arguing with you whether Hyper Light is or isn't a heavily story-driven game. There's no question, we agree about that.

What I'm saying is they crafted a story in the universe of Castlevania. They didn't lift a story directly out of one of the games. They used the premise and the world, and created a really satisfying, standalone story. Based on that, I think the fact that Hyper Light is vague and mysterious and light on direct narrative is not a drawback, but rather lets them tell another satisfying standalone story in a setting that is neat and mysterious."
Drifters,[deleted]
Drifters,"No it doesn’t, it’s almost incredible how fucking retarded you have to be to slam this as facts.

Believe it or not Dark Souls’s world building has been praised and it isn’t for nothing, you have to get to know the world by exploring it. It’s like saying Shadow of the collossus’s story is bad because they don’t speak in it. 

A story getting told through visuals isn’t a bad thing. Dark Souls 1 and Bloodborne both have a story that gets regularly praised, even if DS1 is cryptic. 

Just because it isn’t shown in your face doesn’t mean it’s bad. It’s not the main focus but they want to reward players who do want to know more about the world. 

Your whole example of showing this to an English professor is incredibly fucking stupid, I bet you can present a professor with an oscar nominated screenplay and there is still a chance they’ll say it’s fucking terrible. "
Drifters,[deleted]
Drifters,"> The game is popular because it's difficult. 

lol, this is what people who haven't played the games think. By the way, the challenge in DS also factors into the story, because any human in this world that loses all hope and will to continue turns into a husk devoid of humanity. So basically, if the player stops playing, then their character will also turn into one of the mindless undead. It couldn't matter less if some English professor doesn't find that interesting."
Drifters,[deleted]
Drifters,"It's literally the story of the game. Tell me, how much do you actually know about Dark Souls other than it being hard?"
Drifters,[deleted]
Drifters,"Thanks for the genuine chuckle, buddy"
Drifters,[deleted]
Drifters,"Nah, I'm good with ending the conversation here. I want to end it on a high note"
Drifters,Good thing he deleted his responses after this it’s almost as if he finally came to terms with his own retardation. 
Drifters,[removed]
Drifters,[deleted]
Drifters,"Probably because it’s something exclusive to video games? 

Journey gets you to make a connection with a total stranger. Never been done before doesn’t make it bad.

Also I did name an example, Shadow of the Colossus. "
Drifters,[deleted]
Drifters,"I find it incredible that even though Dark Souls has a massive fanbase that are so incredibly interested in the LORE and the game’s story you still think that this is somehow you’re right. 

Shadow of the Colossus is not like a silent movie, to understand what’s going on you’re going to have to explore the environment moreso then just beating the monsters. 

The comments that got deleted really show you just despise the souls games (Bloodborne looks like a PS2 game lol what are you blind) and that’s fine just don’t think you somehow think your opinion is fact when in truth you’ve never beaten any of them or played any of them besides Bloodborne. It’s honestly pathetic. "
Drifters,"That sounds quite interesting. The name makes it sound like a zombie thing like World War Z, Day Z or something. Maybe that's why it got cancelled."
Drifters,"I wish its prequel was better;
Y: The Last Man


^(It's weird how well their titles go together)"
Drifters,These posts are great. Keep it up!
Drifters,"Hmm, from the name I would expect a different show. Maybe the reason it was canceled is that it was just poorly named."
Drifters,i think this was the best sitcom ever made
Drifters,"""I landed on a fork.""

EDIT: This entire episode is fantastic, by the way. Flesh is burning na na na na naaaaaa na"
Drifters,"Rewatching these again now, niles has always been my favourite. "
Drifters,"[This is the scene that got me to watch Frasier.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nS41-JeZ3EE)

It was posted on here a couple years ago. I figured I'd give it a shot after watching it and I'm glad I did. The chemistry between Kelsey Grammer and David Hyde Pierce is great and, in my opinion, better than most of what I've seen from sitcoms of that time. They played off one another so well. Like others said, it doesn't get the attention that Friends or Seinfeld get, but it's a really enjoyable show to watch."
Drifters,"A couple of my favourites:    
[Get Out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoYAgKGnZ6U])

[Buttons and Bows](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvAWUJCjgQE)
"
Drifters,That show just would not have worked without the beautiful interaction between Niles and Frasier. This is one of my favorite shows since I was a kid.
Drifters,"What's it been, twenty years? I still prefer the weeknight reruns on local tv of Frasier over most new shows on now."
Drifters,"First 5 years of the show were usually very good, after 5 years, like most sit-coms they start to go downhill. Even then they still had a a lot of top flight episodes. They really jumped the shark thou when Niles and Daphne got married.

Always loved the ‘Sherry’ episodes.
"
Drifters,"I used to be obsessed with Friends and hated Frasier, but as I grew older, Friends became my least favourite of the 90's golden trio. Now I prefer Frasier, then Seinfeld, then Friends."
Drifters,"The beach house ep kills me. Probably my favorite episode.

“So you found a dead seal, dressed it in a peignoir, doused it in perfume, and stabbed it?”

“I told you you’d laugh!”"
Drifters,"Always enjoyed this show and recommend it, although I know a lot of the jokes fly over people's heads."
Drifters,I think they should bring back Frasier.
Drifters,"""you need an etiquette lesson! """
Drifters,I got the boxset for my birthday 3 years ago and I've still not finished it. Only got one more season :(
Friday Night Dinner,"Great show, Paul Ritter will be missed. This will never work in the US, like every other terrible remake."
Friday Night Dinner,Shit on it!
Friday Night Dinner,I knew about the attempt with Allison Janney & Tony Shalhoub but I had no idea they'd tried two other times as well. I guess it's possible the fourth time is the charm? In pretty cool news apparently in the US you can stream the whole series free with ads on [Roku](https://therokuchannel.roku.com/details/0d52680cf1cd557bbc89bddec29f2726/friday-night-dinner).
Friday Night Dinner,Well that's gonna be a disaster
Friday Night Dinner,Why not air the UK show instead?
Friday Night Dinner,"It’s got good names attached to it, but the original is untouchable. Plus, the silliness probably won’t land using American actors and with American audiences."
Friday Night Dinner,No Thanks!
Friday Night Dinner,I stumbled upon this show a year or two ago while scrolling a streaming service..think i finished it in like 3 days. Really funny show
Friday Night Dinner,Anyone know where to watch the UK version in Canada?
Friday Night Dinner,They need Meredith from the Office to play the mum.
Friday Night Dinner,Can we please just get another season instead? This won’t work without the actors and the british sense of shame and awkwardness
Friday Night Dinner,It won't work.
Friday Night Dinner,Any females?
Friday Night Dinner,No other comments needed. Beautiful.
Friday Night Dinner,"If it's anything like how they tried   
to make [a US version of *SPACED*](https://youtu.be/iEb8JyglV-c)

...or [a US version of *PEEP SHOW*](https://youtu.be/8Yredc3ayOE)

...or [a US version of *ABSOLUTELY FABULOUS*](https://youtu.be/fQh0ZI-TMmE)"
Friday Night Dinner,There’s a script floating around online for the first episode of the remake. Its… not great.
Friday Night Dinner,Seems they'll never learn.
Friday Night Dinner,Americans don't like watching with subtitles.
Friday Night Dinner,"Too funny for them they need to first re write the script to be devoid of humour and full of political agendas, then it will be ready for screening"
Friday Night Dinner,Seems backwards. American stuff leans into the silliness and throws away the nuance and pathos of the British versions. Look at The Office.
Friday Night Dinner,Sorry buddy just gonna have to wait for the maple syrup version to come out eh?
Friday Night Dinner,"It was on Amazon Prime, at least that's where I watched it."
Friday Night Dinner,"Nope. No Dad, no show."
Friday Night Dinner,Please explain how in your head another season is possible.
Friday Night Dinner,Lovely bit of squirrel
Friday Night Dinner,"Did you deliberately not mention the US version of the ""The Inbetweeners"" or is that some kind of self-protection mechanism of your brain from too much mental suffering?  
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KADN3xFICHk"
Friday Night Dinner,Roseanne’s last season was a better reproduction of Ab Fan.
Friday Night Dinner,I can't believe Kristen Johnston and Kathryn Hahn agreed to star in the remake of Ab Fab. What a disaster.
Friday Night Dinner,"And the Office!

Oh, wait, exception to the rule, I suppose. Or maybe that's the one all of these are trying to emulate (poorly)."
Friday Night Dinner,"What in the?!

That Peep Show clip isnt even shot in first person pov… the inner monologue vo is only half of the style."
Friday Night Dinner,Don't forget the [US version of *THE IT CROWD*](https://youtu.be/YUdGpkdksKE)
Friday Night Dinner,Damm no we were watching it on a streamer and then one day it disappeared.
Friday Night Dinner,Crimble crumble
Friday Night Dinner,We like our tv culture way too much to even acknowledge the creation of this shit
Friday Night Dinner,BritBox streams all British shows and movies but I don’t know if that’s licensed in Canada
Friday Night Dinner,"He was phenomenal in Chernobyl. I'd only seen him in the UK comedy sitcom Friday Night Dinner previously, which he played one of the funniest characters in the last decade in."
Friday Night Dinner,"Man, such a shame. He was amazing as Dyatlov in Chernobyl."
Friday Night Dinner,"Super sad, 54 is far too young. RIP"
Friday Night Dinner,"Gutted. Him as Martin in Friday Night Dinner has been one of my favourite and up there with the most funny characters in recent British comedy. 

So many of his lines are just iconic and repeated up and down the country."
Friday Night Dinner,Goodbye Bambinos :(
Friday Night Dinner,"Oh shit on the bleeding thing. 

Between him and Jessica Walter this year is really doing the legendary sitcom characters dirty."
Friday Night Dinner,"My 10 year old is a huge fan of Friday Night Dinners and is gutted it is unlikely to return and that Paul has died. I have given him permission to say “Shit on it!” as many times as he likes today.

EDIT: I wanted to add that this show taught him what a typical family interaction is outside of our own.  He is disabled and struggles to understand most interactions. This show really got through to him and showed him how ‘most’ families interact. It also made him wee himself laughing. It is an excellent show."
Friday Night Dinner,Shit on it :(
Friday Night Dinner,"“He’s delusional, take him to the infirmary”"
Friday Night Dinner,"So sad, he made every role memorable. Will go down as a British comedy icon for his role on Friday Night Dinner"
Friday Night Dinner,"Oh that's completely shit.  I loved every minute of friday night dinners, he was hilarious. My wife and I quote his lines all the time. Then he appeared in Chernobyl as possibly one of the most terrifying portrayals of a real person I've ever seen. He'll be missed."
Friday Night Dinner,"This is just terribly sad, fuck cancer. 

Martin on Friday Night Dinner quickly entered the British cultural zeitgeist over the last decade, that character was absolutely beloved and it wouldn't have been welcomed to that degree without Paul playing the character. Combine that with Dyatlov in Chernobyl, he was really becoming an internationally beloved character actor over the last few years. 

It makes me sad to think that he had so much more to give but at the same time it's nice to know how much love he got over the last few years. RIP Paul."
Friday Night Dinner,"Only 54. What a terrible shame that we won’t get to continue to enjoy this talented actors work. RIP Paul. 
Gone far too soon."
Friday Night Dinner,SHIT ON THE SHITTING THING!
Friday Night Dinner,"I really enjoyed him in Friday Night Dinner but when I saw him in Chernobyl, I thought this is the beginning of an amazing movie career. Tragic"
Friday Night Dinner,I didn't know he had brain tumour. He was really talented and 54 is too young to die. My mom has brain tumour too and seeing these kind of news makes me scared.
Friday Night Dinner,Incredible as Dyatlov. It’s always sad to see talented character actors such as Ritter pass on.
Friday Night Dinner,It's a real shame. Too many comedical gems have died this year. I wish his family well during these troubling times.
Friday Night Dinner,"Really sad news, he was one of my favourite “hey it’s that guy” actors. Never saw him give a poor performance. RIP, 54 is way too young."
Friday Night Dinner,"Shit on it. This is sad obviously, but he was younger than me, and selfishly that somehow makes it hit harder..."
Friday Night Dinner,"He was hilarious in Friday Night Dinner. When watching Chernobyl, it took me way too long to realise that he was playing Dyatlov, which says something about his amazing performance in that too."
Friday Night Dinner,"Genuinely so sad, was only just watching the show for the umpteenth time. What an actor."
Friday Night Dinner,"OMG! This is sad. Every time something shitty happened, I would say ""Shit on it!"" and have a little giggle. FND was one of my favorite shows! 

RIP."
Friday Night Dinner,Shit on it. I'm gutted he was great in Friday night dinner. We should all go shirtless this Friday night in memory of him
Friday Night Dinner,"Dear tumors:

Bugger off."
Friday Night Dinner,"Man, he was only 54..."
Friday Night Dinner,Damn he was only 54. That’s the same age as my dad.   “Shit on it” has been in my vocabulary for so long too. R.I.P.
Friday Night Dinner,Bambino 🥺🤝
Friday Night Dinner,"Not great, Not terrible

Okay, it's terrible"
Friday Night Dinner,"54?! Not great, pretty terrible :("
Friday Night Dinner,"Not great. Really terrible. :(

What a phenomenal actor! He will be missed."
Friday Night Dinner,"I think he has to be may all time favourite actor. His comedy performance in FND and drama performance in Chernobyl are among the best I've seen. I know Friday Night Dinner has finished already, but I always had my fingers crossed for a Christmas/charity special, but now I guess it can't really happen. And it wouldnt work if they did, it wouldnt be the same without him."
Friday Night Dinner,"Not great, pretty terrible :("
Friday Night Dinner,As someone who's FIL just got diagnosed with one and has radiation starting today. Not what I wanted to see today. Fuck
Friday Night Dinner,"Hilarious on Friday night dinner, I’m sure his roles and characters will be remembered for a long time. Bless his family, he will be missed."
Friday Night Dinner,So tragic. Wonderful actor in everything he did.
Friday Night Dinner,"He was great in Chernobyl as others have said, and also in the all too short bbc series The Game. The show wasn’t the best but he improved every scene he was in"
Friday Night Dinner,I’ll be having a lovely bit of squirrel for dinner tonight in his honour
Friday Night Dinner,"Fantastic actor, hilarious in Friday Night Dinner and so memorable in Chernobyl. He will be missed."
Friday Night Dinner,"Oh my god! I live across the pond and just happened to find Friday Night Dinner when it first premiered.

One of the finest roles in comedy in decades. He will be terribly missed :(

Shit on it..."
Friday Night Dinner,"Oh fucking hell, what a shame. I loved him in No Offence as well as Friday Night Dinner and Chernobyl."
Friday Night Dinner,Fuck that's terrible. He was absolutely phenomenal in Chernobyl. RIP.
Friday Night Dinner,He was incredibly funny in this and was as good as you could find in Chernobyl. RIP.
Friday Night Dinner,Loved him in Chernobyl and Friday night dinner (just sad we won’t probably get anymore Friday night dinner) RIP
Friday Night Dinner,Shit on it!
Friday Night Dinner,I'll shit on it in his honour
Friday Night Dinner,I’m literally in shock... this doesn’t feel real
Friday Night Dinner,"This is the fucking worst. Amazing actor, so upset. Had the privilege of seeing this man on stage. True honour. Criminally underrated too."
Friday Night Dinner,"Shit on it. 

It's such sad news but it's wonderful to see this on the front page and read these comments. I wonder if he knew how loved and respected he was as an actor. 

He made Friday night dinner for me, and I've heard he was fantastic in chernobyl. 

RIP."
Friday Night Dinner,"He's delusional, take him to the infirmary 😭"
Friday Night Dinner,"Ah, fuck. He was so so funny in Friday Night Dinner and so good in Chernobyl. RIP to a great actor ❤"
Friday Night Dinner,And as the pathologist in ‘ No Offence ‘  .. and briefly in ‘ Vera ‘ as well..
Friday Night Dinner,"Superb actor , he was so good in Friday night dinner . His lines “Any females” , “Shit on it” were hilarious."
Friday Night Dinner,I’m boiling!!!!!!
Friday Night Dinner,Shit on it :(
Friday Night Dinner,"Shit on it in heaven, Mr Ritter."
Friday Night Dinner,I saw him in Rent with Tim Key at the Old Vic a while ago. He was excellent. Tim Key was suprisingly good too. Good actor.
Friday Night Dinner,I'm boiling Jackie! Shit on it. What an absolute gem. RIP Paul
Friday Night Dinner,I worked with him on The Norman Conquests. Very nice man.
Friday Night Dinner,No offence is maybe one of the best unknown things with him. Everyone is great in it.
Friday Night Dinner,Who was he in Harry Potter?
Friday Night Dinner,"thought it was John Ritter for a second and i was like ""i thought he died already"""
Friday Night Dinner,John Ritter and Paul Ritter both died at 54. Illuminati confirmed/s
Friday Night Dinner,Hope he has many crimble crumble
Friday Night Dinner,RIP.
Sharpes Challenge,"So, I guess their goal today was to take everyone who said D+ had no original content besides The Mandalorian, and pretty much punch them in the face repeatedly."
Sharpes Challenge,Hooch is crazy

Sharpes Challenge,I thought this was wallstreebets DD for a second lol
Sharpes Challenge,"Nothing on any of the ""old"" Netflix series has me sad...  Nice write up, though."
Sharpes Challenge,/u/arashtp you missed Percy Jackson.
Sharpes Challenge,Super stoked on most of this. I’m especially looking forward to the Nat geo content. Can you imagine if Disney+ dropped with half of these titles? Game changer
Sharpes Challenge,"Based on the release timelines of those shows, it looks like their strategy is: 

Zeitgeist show for 6 weeks -> 1 week of cool down —> couple weeks of hype up -> next Zeitgeist show -> Repeat"
Sharpes Challenge,They're really going all out with the High Republic.
Sharpes Challenge,did She Hulk get a trailer or anything?
Sharpes Challenge,that's a lot of content
Sharpes Challenge,"So strange to realize Ice Age is owned by Disney now. 

Also I’m sort of unexpectedly excited about the continuation of Mighty Ducks!"
Sharpes Challenge,A Turner and Hooch reboot yyyeeeeessss!!! I've been a fan (we call ourselves Hoochers) for years and am flipping out right now!!!!
Sharpes Challenge,Missing rogue squadron on Star Wars
Sharpes Challenge,Hocus Pocus 2. What.
Sharpes Challenge,"A lot of this is awesome, but can I just take a moment to appreciate *Sister Act 3*?"
Sharpes Challenge,">Tiana is the first princess to have her own Walt Disney Animation Studios series

Just going to ignore the Little Mermaid and Tangled series apparently."
Sharpes Challenge,[deleted]
Sharpes Challenge,I have only read a hand full of moon knight comics but from what I have heard and read making a PG moon knight show is not going to go over well with fans.
Sharpes Challenge,Any specific dates to go with this?
Sharpes Challenge,You forgot the multiple tongue in cheek references to Matt Murdock.  Charlie Cox's Daredevil is officially part of the MCU now.  Hes apparently in She Hulk and Spider-Man 3.
Sharpes Challenge,"Damn, the Ducks end up becoming what they rebelled against..."
Sharpes Challenge,"As a bi dude I'm still waiting for literally anything big that features a non-straight dude. In film they ignored it almost completely out of fear of gay-hating countries banning it and them losing money (like China). 

Really hoping for something to come through, maybe with x-men back in the fold Iceman could get something"
Sharpes Challenge,So is Ahsoka taking the place of the Rebels spinoff? Because thats what I was most excited for
Sharpes Challenge,Disney is milking Star Wars and Marvel for everything dollar they can squeeze. There are way too many reboots and remakes. They need originally sourced content that has no reliance on existing IP. How about some original NON-Marvel/Star Wars scripted content? I think the Mandalorian is a cute show but I want to see ORIGINAL content for once. This slate of shows are not enough to keep all of their subscribers satisfied.
Sharpes Challenge,I just want to have the spin off Thrawn and Ezra travels in space show.
Sharpes Challenge,"Hey, bozo, why didn't you mention It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia?

Great list, otherwise."
Sharpes Challenge,so much content that post alone made me vomit .
Sharpes Challenge,Seems like Star Wars's future is on TV.
Sharpes Challenge,Is it weird that I'm most excited for the Josh Peck version of Turner and Hooch?
Sharpes Challenge,"Looks like they're updating Microcosmos with A Real Bug's Life, that should be cool as fuck."
Sharpes Challenge,">The Mighty Ducks: Game Changers

>Lauren Graham (Gilmore Girls, Parenthood) and Emilio Estevez (reprising his role from the original feature films) star in the next chapter of the hit Mighty Ducks franchise, premiering in early 2021. In present day Minnesota, the Mighty Ducks have evolved from scrappy underdogs to an ultra-competitive, powerhouse youth hockey team. After 12-year-old Evan is unceremoniously cut from the Ducks, he and his mom Alex set out to build their own ragtag team of misfits to challenge the cutthroat, win-at-all-costs culture of competitive youth sports.

I hope Disney has been paying attn to Cobra Kai and takes all the good from it and applies it to the Ducks!!!"
Sharpes Challenge,"Man, Tony Stark cannot keep control of his tech, can he? Well, I guess he's dead, so that makes sense."
Sharpes Challenge,The one thing I want from Marvel is an OG Nick Fury and the Howling Commandos show.
Sharpes Challenge,They forgot Shadow Hunters.
Sharpes Challenge,Disney+ launch was more like beta test to ensure their decision of allocating such resources to the platform
Sharpes Challenge,"The criticism was regarding lack of original screenplays, too. It's still true in that aspect."
Sharpes Challenge,"It's still lacks diversity, it's still marvel, star wars and Pixar animated pg-13 movies, still no new new IPs."
Sharpes Challenge,[deleted]
Sharpes Challenge,"If they don't have Phill Lewis playing the dog using mocap, they dun goofed."
Sharpes Challenge,*holds up lighter*
Sharpes Challenge,Thanks man you're awesome
Sharpes Challenge,[Rogue squadron](https://youtu.be/5bLkTjn6Y_s)
Sharpes Challenge,Not enough 🚀🚀🚀
Sharpes Challenge,"Just hints at Daredevil, from Sony in Spider-Man 3 and at the reveal here today for She-Hulk."
Sharpes Challenge,"Yeah sounds like the Multiverse in SM3 will pull in Daredevil and Kingpin. Which could be great.

Daredevil was hinted at strongly for SheHulk, and there have been rumors that DNofrio has campaigned hard and they’ve taken him seriously as maybe using his character to put together the Sinister Six."
Sharpes Challenge,"There's a big hint in Hawkeye. Maya Lopez is a definitively Daredevil character (Echo, a deaf woman who can see something once and imitate it originally hired by Kingpin to take out Daredevil and eventually befriending him). She also wore the Ronin outfit for awhile that Hawkeye wore in Endgame after his family vanished (New Avengers comics).

Edit: why am I being downvoted for this?"
Sharpes Challenge,And Swiss Family Robinson.
Sharpes Challenge,It’s pretty genius
Sharpes Challenge,Super into the Acolyte as I’d really like to see what the Sith/dark side users were up to during this time period
Sharpes Challenge,"No, but they confirmed Tatiana Maslany."
Sharpes Challenge,Tim Roth will be back as Abomination and Mark Ruffalo.
Sharpes Challenge,Its a rather deceptive line if your not in the know.  WDAS is the movie studio. Disney Television Animation is the studio that typically handles the TV side (they were the ones that made the Tangled series).
Sharpes Challenge,That's not necessarily a bad thing tbh. It's how they execute it that matters. GOTG was kinda considered a bottom of the barrel IP for marvel before they made it and it turned out well.
Sharpes Challenge,"There’s like 70 announced shows here and less than 10 are actual original ideas. Really disappointing *in my opinion*.

I get people like Star Wars and stuff, but it seems extreme to me."
Sharpes Challenge,"I think it could be done. For me at least the fun part is the mind-bendy unreliable narrator stuff and not the graphic violence. Although there is something to be said for when other characters meet Moon Knight and are like, ""oh this guy is *crazy* crazy and not just *Batman* crazy."""
Sharpes Challenge,"This didn’t mention any of the Marvel movies since it’s still not certain whether they’ll be released in theaters first or on Disney+ at the same time, but The Eternals is set to have their first openly gay main character whenever that’s released.

If you haven’t watched the Disney+ short film Out, you absolutely should."
Sharpes Challenge,"Young Avengers is just over the horizon, and that comes with the most prominent gay couple in marvel. Still a few years out though."
Sharpes Challenge,Not sure if it is 100% confirmed but I remember seeing somewhere that Valkyrie is looking for a wife in the next Thor movie.
Sharpes Challenge,"As a fellow homo, I'm sorry you're getting downvoted, but that's r/television for you. I've learned not to bring up representation issues on this sub anymore."
Sharpes Challenge,"I would bet it will be in a team, or they will reveal the character is gay in a sequel...that way people in China will already be invested.  Because you’re right....they want that China money badly. 


Wouldn’t it be a kick in the nuts to China if the wait until like Shang Chi 3 and reveal he was gay the whole time! Lmao. That could literally start a war!!"
Sharpes Challenge,"I feel like this'll be a big part of the Ashoka show, considering that she was still searching when we see her in The Mandolorian."
Sharpes Challenge,Thats not on Disney+ you 1 star fool.
Sharpes Challenge,That’s pathetic
Sharpes Challenge,I really don't like the sound of this. The whole point of the Ducks is that they are scrappy underdogs. Having them become what they played against feels kind of weird. And it's obviously gonna end with both Ducks teams playing against each other. It just sounds weird to me.
Sharpes Challenge,"They're going all in because they've lost all profits from Disney parks and tourism, 75% of their revenue.

Also why they gutted ESPN"
Sharpes Challenge,"Certainly, but was anyone really expecting that? Aside from Pixar, Disney hasn't done an original story in... I'm not sure. Possibly ever."
Sharpes Challenge,Pixar films are all new IPs lol
Sharpes Challenge,[deleted]
Sharpes Challenge,One Star Wars IP will drive more total interest than anything on HBO Max lmao
Sharpes Challenge,"Uh ""Win or Lose"" is a new IP."
Sharpes Challenge,"You are soo right. Marvel has been overdone, it's a stale medium at this point.  SW feels the same after the last 3 movies. Even Mando is aimless with no real main plotline.

It's so formulaic it isn't appealing.

Will smith movie,
Cars tv show, 
SW, SW, SW, SW, SW
Marvel movies or shows of all side movie characters, because why not saturate the market with bland superheros"
Sharpes Challenge,"Yeah. Did anyone really expect Disney to do something genuinely new? Aside from Pixar, which still has very niche content, I can't remember the last time Disney did an actually new story. 

It's one of the reasons this obsession people on here have with D+ ""killing"" Netflix is so silly."
Sharpes Challenge,Well original content in this context means content that is developed specificity for the platform and is owned by Disney
Sharpes Challenge,"
>Daredevil was hinted at strongly for SheHulk...

That doesn't excite me...  I don't see Daredevil remaining dark and gritty if placed in She-Hulk.  SH over the years has been more of a fun loving character."
Sharpes Challenge,"It's going to be interesting to see how Tim Roth plays his take on Mark Ruffalo.

Sharpes Challenge,"It's a Disney property.

They a announced it today, as well.

It actually appears on traditional broadcast television, anyone who can't see this **IS A SAVAGE AND AN IDIOT**.

Stoked about almost all of these, though."
Sharpes Challenge,Most of these projects are planned before the COVID
Sharpes Challenge,Different services provide different content. I dont see why that's only an issue when it's Disney. How much Oscar winning animated content do we see on HBO or Netflix?
Sharpes Challenge,Duh.  If you want Disney's adult content you mosey over to Hulu.  If you've been looking at the end of the year critics' lists you'll have noticed Disney is beating Netflix and Warnerbrothers decisively when it comes to critical acclaim.
Sharpes Challenge,Disney doesn’t give a fuck about that. They care about commercial success of which they aren’t matched.
Sharpes Challenge,The show is listed as a comedy. Not sure how Charlie's Matt Murdock would fit into that.
Sharpes Challenge,"I get it. But AntMan seemed really dumb to me. So did Thor at the time, and GotG is when I thought they had given up. 

I think the Series will be used to set up bigger events in the movies.  Almost like a Rogue One to Star Wars.  

That way people who want more background will have it, and yet you don’t HAVE to have seen it to follow the movies.  

Also Ironheart, Kate Bishop, Ms Marvel and I’m betting a Young Loki will get set up for a Secret Avengers movie."
Sharpes Challenge,"Armor Wars is widely considered one of the best, if not the best period, Iron Man stories.

We’ll most likely see Justin Hammer return and the intro of some other big Iron Man villains like Crimson Dynamo.

I wouldn’t call it bottom of the barrel. The only difference is that War Machine will he finally getting the spotlight rather than Iron Man"
Sharpes Challenge,"Well, you have to remember, when they first started making Marvel movies, Iron Man was a very odd choice in how to begin."
Sharpes Challenge,Yes.  Can they only make outer space/superhero stuff?  That’s not the only genre.
Sharpes Challenge,"Vikings and Ozark are not on the list because you did not enjoyed or because you never watched?

I love Game of Thrones,The Last Kingdom,The Handmaid's Tale and Westworld from your list.
Unpopular but i also enjoyed Cursed,It was fun to watch.
Season 4 of The Walking Dead was one of the best seasons in my opinion,If you disliked that season you would have hated some seasons in the future."
Sharpes Challenge,Big Mouth is 10? That's seriously the worst show I've ever seen.  I always wondered who exactly watched that.
Sharpes Challenge,How is Ted lasso not a 10
Sharpes Challenge,Bob is awesome! Love that show!
Sharpes Challenge,"If you subtracted 5 from each rating and went an ""* out of 5"" rating system instead, it still would be about the same."
Sharpes Challenge,"Half of Game of Thrones (seasons 1-4) is a 10/10 show and the other half of it (seasons 5-8) is a 2/10 show.

So averaging them together, the show gets a 6/10."
Sharpes Challenge,Breaking Bad but no Better Call Saul?
Sharpes Challenge,Ewww Chrishell and Christine are both bad. Mary all the way.
Sharpes Challenge,"Vikings and Ozark are on my list to watch! As for TWD I think I may have stopped after 3rd season? I don't remember as it was a while back but will definitely have to resume. I forgot to add to this list but the new show Invincible is really, really good and is made from the same people as TWD, highly recommend."
Sharpes Challenge,exceptional in its 1st season and hits different but 10/10 is hard to hit for me and should be reserved for the absolute best that couldn't have been better
Sharpes Challenge,😑
Sharpes Challenge,"if he multiplied each rating by 13.8 and did a “* out of 138” rating sys, it would also be about the same"
Sharpes Challenge,"It definitely got worse in the later seasons but for the most part it was still pretty epic, quality, or maybe I was just so invested at that point (sunk cost). Either way still an amazing show but I get where you're coming from"

Michael McIntyres Comedy Roadshow,"I definitely agree with you!

I have to wonder though if there exists another person on the planet who has seen those 3 Schur shows and hasn’t seen The Office."
Michael McIntyres Comedy Roadshow,"If you haven't already, make sure to listen to the official The Good Place podcast, hosted by Marc Evan Jackson (he played Shawn/Kevin Cozner/Trevor Nelsson).  He interviewed cast, crew, and writers about every episode of the show, and it was terrific.  There was even a short side series for Brooklyn 99."
Michael McIntyres Comedy Roadshow,"OP to answer your statement, yes, Schur brings it home every time."
Michael McIntyres Comedy Roadshow,"As of writing this comment, this post is only 40 minutes old, has no other comments, yet is halfway up the frontpage for me.

This is not a dog at OP, but I'm confused as to what's changed with Reddit over the past few weeks. Has there been an adjustment to the algorithm so that text posts are heavily favoured, despite the lack of engagement? Same thing is really visible in /r/movies."
Michael McIntyres Comedy Roadshow,"I agree.  The only ""bad"" show I've seen with him is Rutherford Falls.  I don't know what happened there, but my girlfriend and I stopped watching after two episodes. We Love The Office, The Good Places, Brooklyn 99, and Parks and Rec.  Rutherford Falls just fell flat.  Don't think we laughed once."
Michael McIntyres Comedy Roadshow,"I binged The Good Place while sick, and the ending fucked me up. Like sobbing levels of emotional feels."
Michael McIntyres Comedy Roadshow,"With B99, just remember that they had already written the first half of the season when George Floyd was murdered - so they had to rewrite them **quick**"
Michael McIntyres Comedy Roadshow,"I loved the endings for parks and rec and the good place but not so much B99. The whole last season just lost the magic for me. That’s okay though, still loved the show."
Michael McIntyres Comedy Roadshow,"Michael schur is the most talented comedy write in the business imo, i also loved him in the office as mose.. he is amazing and very sharp minded, the good place is a master piece!"
Michael McIntyres Comedy Roadshow,The ending was sentimental as hell with the writers losing sight of the fact the show was at its best when the characters were fighting failure.
Michael McIntyres Comedy Roadshow,"I hated watching the Good Place finale, but it was written and acted well for sure! I think it helps that his comedies always has a lot of melancholy elements and emotion to them. You want to say goodbye to your favourite characters in a sentimental way, but that doesn't work on all sitcoms - it does here!"
Michael McIntyres Comedy Roadshow,"It's pretty different (like actually bad main characters who don't improve until very late on the show, or never at all), so it makes sense some people wouldn't watch it even if they love the other ones, and even if it's similarly funny. It took me several tries to get into it because I couldn't get over the mean jokes and how badly everyone was behaving! I prefer to have a more gentle heart of the show, which all the other shows have."
Michael McIntyres Comedy Roadshow,"Here actually. 

Watched these three but never been interested in The Office. 

But then I'm a Brit, and Ricky Gervais kind of ruined it for me. I know US Office has a different vibe to the UK one, but I still can't bring myself to watch it after seeing a few episodes of the original."
Michael McIntyres Comedy Roadshow,"Here as well!! Could never get into it, just got on my nerves too much to stay interested."
Michael McIntyres Comedy Roadshow,I have seen those. Only seen little bits of The Office through clips and I cannot **stand** it
Michael McIntyres Comedy Roadshow,">he played *Shawn*

You need the italics to put that little something extra in it like he always did."
Michael McIntyres Comedy Roadshow,"So you're telling me the algorithm might reward my rants? Delightful. 

OP, I doubt many would credibly argue with the concept that the guy can really put out quality content without it falling apart."
Michael McIntyres Comedy Roadshow,This discussion happened earlier in r/movies and yes it’s weird. Posts with zero upvotes or comments are going up the front page in multiple subs.
Michael McIntyres Comedy Roadshow,I’ve had to block the movies sub as my entire feed was just a bunch of random question posts with things like “Am I the only one that likes Chris Nolan movies?” Or “What’s a movie with a good actor in it?”
Michael McIntyres Comedy Roadshow,Text posts like this are “good for engagement”. Reddit trying to maximise one of their KPIs.
Michael McIntyres Comedy Roadshow,"SAME and it’s realllly annoying, especially because there’s no way to adjust the settings. I keep seeing multiple posts from the same sub with 0 upvotes or low amount, and it’s because they’re shitty posts. I hope they fix this soon"
Michael McIntyres Comedy Roadshow,"Same, idk if it’s just the mobile app algorithm or across all of Reddit but half my feed is “what’s your least favorite show where…” or “who’s an actor everyone likes but you don’t like?” And all posted within the last hour."
Michael McIntyres Comedy Roadshow,"That's too bad, I really liked it personally! But it did differ a bit in tone, and took longer to get into than eg. The Good Place or B99."
Michael McIntyres Comedy Roadshow,"I haven’t seen B-99, but The Office is definitely my least favorite of the three I’ve seen for exactly the same reasons you listed.  I’m typically watching short form comedies for light hearted warmth, or else I’ll watch Community or Seinfeld"
Michael McIntyres Comedy Roadshow,Season 2 onwards the US version diverges pretty dramatically. Recommend you watch the first episode of season 2.
Michael McIntyres Comedy Roadshow,Same!
Michael McIntyres Comedy Roadshow,"ah yes, that podcast about a very unusual half hour of American network television."
Michael McIntyres Comedy Roadshow,"They just implemented a rule yesterday to address this (and hopefully end this).
 https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/zwm24w/due_to_the_recent_influx_of_low_effort_posts_we/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=mweb3x"
Michael McIntyres Comedy Roadshow,"Same (about what I want from short form comedy shows)! Community also has a lot of heart stuffed in between the cynicism and terrible people XD It works for me. Especially if I ignore Pierce.

I really recommend B99, if you don't mind that it's about NYPD officers (it requires some suspension of disbelief). At least as funny as the other ones, and it gets more and more wholesome as well when the characters' relationships evolve."
Michael McIntyres Comedy Roadshow,"For mostly light hearted warmth, check out Superstore if you haven't yet.  Also Home Economics."
Michael McIntyres Comedy Roadshow,"You’re absolutely right about that, *most* of the characters genuinely care about each other and it’s why the show works. 

I do want to check out B99 eventually.  Cop shows in general aren’t my favorite, but I like both Schur and Samberg enough to give it a shot."
Michael McIntyres Comedy Roadshow,"Yeah, totally get that. I think it's easier for me to enjoy because I'm not American and have a lot of distance to American cops. I just treat it as an entirely fictional universe, far from reality. And the cast is so goddamn charming (Samberg especially)."
Michael McIntyres Comedy Roadshow,"You’ve convinced me.  I lean too far into the “appreciate the art, damn the artist” side of thinking to not be able to give fictional police officers a chance when everyone involved is a gem."
Michael McIntyres Comedy Roadshow,:) I hope you enjoy it!
Michael McIntyres Comedy Roadshow,MA! CALL THE FUCKIN COPS! THE FUCKIN MURDERER IS BACK! AH!
Michael McIntyres Comedy Roadshow,As long as they also bring his neighbors cat it will be ok.
Michael McIntyres Comedy Roadshow,If he's the murderer then I'm fine with this lol
Michael McIntyres Comedy Roadshow,He’s always the same guy in whatever he’s in.
Michael McIntyres Comedy Roadshow,This guys a total clown ass hat.
Michael McIntyres Comedy Roadshow,This dude is annoying as hell.
Michael McIntyres Comedy Roadshow,"After seeing these new additions for s2, I’m kinda left wondering if the series would’ve been better off as a 1 season “limited series”."
Michael McIntyres Comedy Roadshow,Lol of course he is playing a cop.
Michael McIntyres Comedy Roadshow,"Michael Rapaport is so odd. As an actor he is great. He has been good in every role I have seen him in. As a person, he is super annoying."
Michael McIntyres Comedy Roadshow,"I don't know enough about Michael to judge this news.  Any reason for all the ""its ruined now"" comments?  Not disagreeing, just curious."
Michael McIntyres Comedy Roadshow,"That shit on his lip, has got some shit on its lip."
Michael McIntyres Comedy Roadshow,"ewwww, why?"
Michael McIntyres Comedy Roadshow,Love the show. Can't stand him.
Michael McIntyres Comedy Roadshow,Why are they trying to kill the show so soon
Michael McIntyres Comedy Roadshow,He’s such an unlikeable douche. I hope he gets murdered quickly.
Michael McIntyres Comedy Roadshow,Dang I liked that show too.
Michael McIntyres Comedy Roadshow,Worst comedian.
Michael McIntyres Comedy Roadshow,Dude is so insufferable on Stern I can’t watch him anymore
Michael McIntyres Comedy Roadshow,"I hate this fuckin guy, but he might do alright all things considered"
Michael McIntyres Comedy Roadshow,Ugh. Why?!
Michael McIntyres Comedy Roadshow,Aaaand I’m out
Michael McIntyres Comedy Roadshow,I think he’s great and will add to the zaniness of the show. He was a welcomed surprise on Atypical.
Michael McIntyres Comedy Roadshow,The next guest has to be Kevin Durant lol
Michael McIntyres Comedy Roadshow,Way to ruin an amazing cast. This guy is such a whiney cunt..
Michael McIntyres Comedy Roadshow,Fuck that.  How sad that this guy is going to be performing with such greats as Steve Martin Short and Selena Gomez.
Michael McIntyres Comedy Roadshow,Well that show is gonna go down the tubes. Rapaport isn’t even funny. He’s just a whiny asshole. They should have cast the guy who threw a snowball at him. At least that guy actually has comedic timing.
Michael McIntyres Comedy Roadshow,Should have cast Ari Shaffir instead.
Michael McIntyres Comedy Roadshow,He’s a Moron!  Who gives a crap
Michael McIntyres Comedy Roadshow,"I had to go to one of the stores I do IT support for, and they had a tv just playing random daytime junk, and this buffoon was filling in for Wendy Williams on her show I guess. It was incredibly awkward for this extremely white guy to be talking to crowd of all women, mostly black, being like ""Am I right ladies?""

I tried incredibly hard to tune it out, but I had to sit near this tv for like 2 hours and I think I hate him now."
Michael McIntyres Comedy Roadshow,I love how everyone is shitting on the season 2 cast news considering there was a lot of doubt about Selena Gomez being in the show and she was fantastic. People just need to fucking wait and see.
Michael McIntyres Comedy Roadshow,Gross
Michael McIntyres Comedy Roadshow,Walking herpes.
Michael McIntyres Comedy Roadshow,Will add a different flavor of New York to the cast.  Should be great.
Michael McIntyres Comedy Roadshow,well that’s unfortunate
Michael McIntyres Comedy Roadshow,Too bad he’s as funny as cancer.  His one notable skill is his ability to drop the f-bomb. F that guy.
Michael McIntyres Comedy Roadshow,Great addition to a great show.
Michael McIntyres Comedy Roadshow,One way to convince me to never watch the show
Michael McIntyres Comedy Roadshow,He was annoying in prison break
Michael McIntyres Comedy Roadshow,"If anyone is worried about this dude’s acting, I’d suggest watching the two episodes of The Guest Book that he starred in. One of the more unique roles I’ve seen him in."
Michael McIntyres Comedy Roadshow,"Well, it was fun while it lasted."
Michael McIntyres Comedy Roadshow,No! Please don't room this for me.
Michael McIntyres Comedy Roadshow,I just hope ari bitch slaps him at least once.
Michael McIntyres Comedy Roadshow,Well that show is now fucked. So sad.
Michael McIntyres Comedy Roadshow,Anyone who thinks this guy can't act go and watch the movie 'Copland'
Michael McIntyres Comedy Roadshow,Michael is a great actor.
Michael McIntyres Comedy Roadshow,Aw fuck why?
Michael McIntyres Comedy Roadshow,But... why?
Michael McIntyres Comedy Roadshow,This was my favorite show I watched in 2021. It’s ruined now.
Michael McIntyres Comedy Roadshow,"YO MA! CALL THE COPS THERE'S A FUCKIN DEAD BODY HERE. IT'S FUCKIN STARIN AT ME, MA! IT'S GOT WEIRD FUCKIN EYES!"
Michael McIntyres Comedy Roadshow,"His kristaps Porzingis draft video will always be so of the funniest shit ever, “who the fuck is Tingus Pingus, I never heard of fuckin lativia”"
Michael McIntyres Comedy Roadshow,"""WHO THE FUCK KILLED TINGUS PINGIS?!"""
Michael McIntyres Comedy Roadshow,"Finally, some diversity!!"
Michael McIntyres Comedy Roadshow,"Smh they really trying hard to ruin the second season I see, first Schumer now this"
Michael McIntyres Comedy Roadshow,Since Michael's strongest role is of the angrier type of person it would be awesome to see him in a down and out no hold bare knuckle feud with Shirley Maclaine. Constantly pissed as she wins time and again. Like she is the true bitch and he once was a quiet neighbor but she brings this hellish anger out in him.
Michael McIntyres Comedy Roadshow,God dammit
Michael McIntyres Comedy Roadshow,He stinks and I don’t like him. He just posted that fake video of him getting hit with a snowball before one of his political rants. BOO!
Michael McIntyres Comedy Roadshow,"Gawd dawg nothing but murdururs, B

What else ya gat Chin?"
Michael McIntyres Comedy Roadshow,He’s going to play himself as the star of Splash the musical the movie
Michael McIntyres Comedy Roadshow,I still think it's nuts they tried to cancel him over the ugly cat.
Michael McIntyres Comedy Roadshow,He is obviously gonna play a snitch of some kind.
Michael McIntyres Comedy Roadshow,My favorite Zappa album contributor
Michael McIntyres Comedy Roadshow,Brooklyn Heights x3
Michael McIntyres Comedy Roadshow,Is he going to bitch about all the Rite-Aids shutting down due to rampant shoplifting?
Michael McIntyres Comedy Roadshow,Good choice
Michael McIntyres Comedy Roadshow,On sight.
Top Boy,So looking forward to watching this weekend. One of my favourite shows
Top Boy,Leaves you guessing who will get blackmailed this season?
Top Boy,Great season
Top Boy,"So from my understanding, Summerhouse is the original version of this show but I just looked on Netflix and it looks like Summerhouse season 1 is gone? Can I watch the revival without watching Summerhouse? Can I just watch season 2 of Summerhouse and understand things? Is there any place I can watch season 1 of Summerhouse?"
Top Boy,Is this new season?
Top Boy,"Been looking for my next show. Looks like I found it. Thank you, y’all!"
Top Boy,So it's a crime drama? OK so I need to get my mind outta the gutter.
Top Boy,You can watch this without watching Summerhouse at all
Top Boy,"I had the same problem not being able to find S1 Summerhouse a couple of weeks back, but it appears to be there now?"
Top Boy,"Yes, technically season 4, but S2 of the Netflix revival. The first 2 seasons are on Netflix as “Top Boy: Summerhouse”"
Top Boy,Yes.  It is as poorly a named series as there has ever been.
Top Boy,Is summerhouse good. I've only seen the Netflix era stuff.
Top Boy,"ok, so is this a new one? is this like recently filmed? I'm asking because it seems Netflix didn't really promote this series well. I think top boy and I think the top boy is good series and I think it's very underrated."
Top Boy,Eh? Top boy is slang for boss/don/godfather etc. Just because you don't understand it it doesn't make it a poor name
Top Boy,Watch Summerhouse you won’t be disappointed
Top Boy,The person said yes. Yes it’s new it came out today like brand new unseen episodes that came out today recently filmed and released today.
Top Boy,It looks like Netflix removed Summerhouse series 1
Top Boy,Great. Thanks for letting me know. I just wanted to make sure. It’s weird Netflix doesn’t promote it healthy on this.
Top Boy,Anyone knows or remember what happen to Attica??? I don’t remember.
Top Boy,"Excellent show. The two original seasons are the best (the ""Summerhouse"" seasons on Netflix). Of the ""new"" seasons, the first one is really good but the second one is pretty shit."
Top Boy,"Love Top Boy. Definitely one of the best British TV shows. Was super happy Netflix renewed the revival for a third and final season. Reminds me of a British version of The Wire but only told from the side of the gangsters. 

Definitely one of Netflix’s best shows."
Top Boy,"Yes it’s fantastic. There was one storyline I didn’t much care for in S2 (about Deshawns girlfriend) but overall it’s really high quality television. Great news about the third and final season too, hopefully it wraps up well."
Top Boy,This is a fantastic show that not enough people know about. I can’t wait for the new season.
Top Boy,Any suggestions for other good British shows like this?
Top Boy,"What gets me is how much as the viewer I like and warmed to Sully. I know he’s a despicable person and done terrible things. He also has struggles that seem forced on him from the life he was born into. I feel that over the course of the three seasons he became more enlightened to empathy and that more and more of his conscience came to the fore. Also that second to last episode where Dushane learns he’s been robbed for everything, he has a psycho on his case from Liverpool threatening Lauryn and his mum dies. At this stage he collapses from stress just like a high level exec dealing with a hundred high profile problems.

Edit - ok just saw the ending. Changed my view of Sully!"
Top Boy,"The other obvious one is BBC show Peaky Blinders. I prefer Top Boy but Peaky Blinders is a pretty good show as well. 

Gangs of London is supposed to be a solid modern day gangster drama with a heavier focus on action than Top Boy but I’ve not had a chance to get to it myself. It is definitely on my watchlist as the buzz for the first season was positive. 

It is Australian rather than British but if you have not checked out Mr Inbetween it is well worth a go. One of my favourite shows of recent years. Great acting and a fantastic mix of emotional drama and dark humour."
Top Boy,Haha yes. Interested to see where the relationship will go next season. I loved that little scene of him feeding the fox!
Top Boy,Great news and this will be final season and if you count previous two seaons there will be total 5 seasons which is enough to end it on a high note. This show is one of the best ongoing shows.
Top Boy,"Considering how the last season ended, this season being the end makes alot of sense. LETS GIT THIS FOOD BRUV"
Top Boy,[kisses teeth]
Top Boy,Why does this have such few upvotes? Do Americans not watch this show?
Top Boy,"This show is so good! I’m scared of Sully but want to give him a hug at the same time. Say nothin bruv.

Also lots of love to whoever put A Silver Mt Zion on the soundtrack."
Top Boy,Nice!
Top Boy,I was pissed off that Netflix started the series with their own seasons of the show and at the end it goes back to the Channel 4 episodes that take place before.
Top Boy,"It is. I'm not fond of superlatives, but that one is genuinely underrated."
Top Boy,"FIRST YOU GET THE FEWWD, THEN YOU MAKE THE Ps INNIT"
Top Boy,It is same for most of nonAmerican shows except very popular ones. Some people here always complain about Netflix but they ignore so many nonAmerican good shows of Netflix.
Top Boy,Soon as I got outa work I binged it asap
Top Boy,Took me 3 episodes before I figured out what the fuck Ps were lmao
Top Boy,"If you want food all you need is peas, simple!"
Top Boy,Literally the first time I’ve ever heard anybody compare Top Boy and The Wire
Top Boy,"Top boy is not at all the British wire. Not at all. Completely different styles, completely different points."
Top Boy,"> Take this line from Cam: “Bruv allow them prices there fam, what you think you’re tough and all a them things there brother, can’t come to them prices with bad man rudeboy.” It’s gorgeous, and whether it represents a real slice of how people actually speak in London or whether the writers are just inventing or taking liberties with the language, it’s irresistible.

Jesus what is the reviewer even talking about here."
Top Boy,I have no issue with top boy but the wire goes beyond just being a tv show.
Top Boy,">The most common comparison you’ll see is to HBO’s iconic crime drama The Wire, and there’s something to that, in the sense that it’s a story of a largely poor, black population and the inner-city drug trade that scars their communities. Unlike The Wire, the cops here are peripheral, and the focus is almost entirely on the people of “Summerhouse,” the fictional estate where most of the action plays out.

Says the article itself, while the linked reference backing that claim says: 

>Comparisons to The Wire's hoppers and slingers remain inevitable, especially now that Bennett has widened his vision to comment on gentrification and the real cost of both friendship and crime. Despite his best efforts and those of his charismatic young cast, Top Boy doesn't yet have either the fully confident tone of the American show or its ability to lay a character bare with one well-chosen phrase."
Top Boy,They shouldn’t be in the same sentence
Top Boy,*sucks teeth*
Top Boy,The Ads are evolving.
Top Boy,Gomorrah
Top Boy,Top boy has top marketing eh
Top Boy,[deleted]
Top Boy,Aint nothing as smart or as well acted as the Wire.
Top Boy,"Can you not insult The Wire?

Top boy was good but it’s leagues behind The Wire"
Top Boy,"I like the wire as it’s prolly one of the top few most immersive shows I’ve ever watched; and while I liked some of the Top Boy series (older one mainly) it’s not the same, or even similar. I guess similar genre but that’s it.

The wire is A+ and top boy is good but it’s not Oscar worthy like the wire or however they award Emmy Grammys or whatever to tV shows. 

Overall, watch top boy, it’s good, but if ur choosing between the wire or Top boy, take the wire. It’s just a different league."
Top Boy,"I havn't watched any of this, but from the comments it seems 'Top Boy Summerhouse' is the first two seasons and the separate listing 'Top Boy' is the third season"
Top Boy,Hmm I wouldn’t put the two in the same category
Top Boy,Wah gwan!
Top Boy,Whoever called Top Boy it the British Wire clearly hasn’t watched The Wire and no nothing about inner city Britain.
Top Boy,It’s actually much less.
Top Boy,"Never gonna watch this show cause a cunt from my school is/was in it. little ratfaced fucker call Giacomo Mancini.

Calls himself Jackamo Man-cheeney. which pissed me off for some reason."
Top Boy,Can someone who’s seen both (and that loves the wire) give me an honest opinion of whether top boy is worth watching?
Top Boy,"I love Top Boy and I love the Wire.

Trying to compare them isn't fair to either of them. They are different things. I don't even know where you'd start with comparing them without mangling what either or both of them are doing."
Top Boy,I love this show. Wire has its own and Top Boy has its own place. It’s just Top Boy; it’s not the British Wire.
Top Boy,Lol The Wire is leagues above Top Boy. TB is good but The Wire is most likely the greatest TV show *ever*
Top Boy,Definitely worth watching (especially Summerhouse which is the first 2 seasons) but do not go into it expecting it to be on the same level a The Wire.
Top Boy,"Top Boy is the british wire? Come on, it is not a bad show but it is far far far from being the same level as the wire."
Top Boy,Shiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiit-clay davis
Top Boy,"I haven't even seen this show, but nothing is like The Wire."
Top Boy,Top Boy is very good show mate wtf
Top Boy,The Wire is a slow burner that transcends nearly every other TV drama and has you coming back over and over again. Top Boy is a slow burner that put me to sleep that I can remember almost nothing about and gave up half way through the first season. Just because a major focus is black people in the inner city doesn't automatically make it a British version of The Wire.
Top Boy,[deleted]
Top Boy,Are we also gonna get Vers Boy and Bottom Boy?
Top Boy,"Love this show.  Also loved the Wire.  
Both are classics from 2 different countries. 
RESPECT"
Top Boy,"Shit doesn’t come close to the wire. Jesus fuck. 

Where’s da food mun
Tha food is missin
Go get it then 
We tough

Zzz"
Top Boy,Comparing the two is like comparing a mass shooter to an all out war
Top Boy,Bottom boy is a better title
Top Boy,"Oh wow! Is there a stupid plot where the main character plays series killer? LOL The wire stinks, over use of the black communities problems for white people to say they seen the horrors of the drugs."
Top Boy,"Just because of the disrespect this headline is throwing out, top boy sucks, never seen it never will. British people crime how scary no guns or real threat of anything
“Right m8 you keep this up we’ll have to put you in our cushy prison system where even if you murder someone you can leave just a few short years later”"
Top Boy,Does anyone know when roughly the next season will be released?
Top Boy,I watched first season and it got old on second season.... Not that goood
Top Boy,Summerhouse what!
Top Boy,"As long as people realise that they've got to watch the ""Summerhouse"" series too"
Top Boy,Top Boy is fantastic. Don't go in expecting the Wire in London though cos you'll leave disappointed. It's got it's own style.
Top Boy,Don't get me wrong top boy and summerhouse are both good shows but neither is in the same league as the wire.
Top Boy,Such a classic show. Hopefully there's going to be another season.
Top Boy,Weird how it can be more than the best TC show ever made
Top Boy,"Someone told me to watch Top Boy, stating it was the British Wire and I absolutely hated it. It’s for the over the top violence and shock factor but the character development and storyline was super boring and lacking."
Top Boy,I will give this a watch.  Although I hate when people say it's just like such popular show.  Because usually I'm just comparing the shows and I don't find it very helpful.
Top Boy,"Top Boy is its own thing, a very good show. I really hate comparisons of the sort,  they're just headlines"
Top Boy,Top Boy is watchable. But The Wire is something else…..in a different league of its own.
Top Boy,And now a whole slew of people will watch it. The system works.
Top Boy,I hadn’t heard of Top Boy before this but now I’ll check it out. Shit works.
Top Boy,[deleted]
Top Boy,Not sure if sarcastic
Top Boy,Top boy is so good. Itinit.
Top Boy,"Me too, it’s not at all the same lol topboy is way better"
Top Boy,"I watched the first 15 minutes. Are there any police in it? The whole point of The Wire is watching both sides of the ""drug war"". A show just about gangsters isn't ""The Wire"" at all."
Top Boy,All I care is if it’s good and worth watching. Would you recommend top boy?
Top Boy,[deleted]
Top Boy,Except they completely scripted their characters off the wire. Dushane and Sully = Avon and Slim. Jaq = repackaged Snoop. Jamie = Marlo. Summerhouse redevelopment = Wire towers torn down. The only real difference between the shows is the location and lack of police character focus in Top Boy.
Bottom,They’re saying Coffin Flop’s not a show. It’s just hours and hours of footage of real people falling out of coffins at funerals.
Bottom,"MILF Manor is unhinged:

>As soon as the show’s twist was revealed — that **the women will be dating each other’s sons** — I immediately regretted all of that enthusiasm. If that idea weren’t revolting enough, the producers of the series decided to completely rip away any pretense of class with their first challenge: The moms have to put on blindfolds and feel the chests and abs of the shirtless young guys. The object? Identify the pecs and abs that belong to their adult sons.

I feel unclean reading that sentence."
Bottom,A reminder here that in Zaslavs eyes ironic hate watching is just as good as actually wanting to watch this trash.  All he cares about are subscriber numbers and ad rates.   If you don’t this kind of content the best thing for you to do is to simply not engage with it.  At all.  Don’t watch it and just as importantly don’t post about it.
Bottom,There will be a deeper bottom next year - and the year after...
Bottom,"Coming soon, ""Ow, My Balls!"""
Bottom,"Okay so I didn’t know there was a such a thing as “MILF Manor”, so I did some scientific research and oh my god….  Just when you think that you’ve seen every possible bizarre scenario that reality tv could possibly conjur, TLC goes “Yeah, well, we’ll just see about that.”"
Bottom,"What is this, a 30 Rock episode?

I’ll be waiting for Milf Island next season"
Bottom,"Next up...The Running Man.

I really thought I'd die before the inevitability of this, but...here we are!"
Bottom,"Tank It! Where we make grandpas put on tank tops and then laugh at them.

and do you like the information you get when you stay at a hotel? Well, Thursdays is just that now!"
Bottom,David Zaslav *is* the bottom of the barrel.
Bottom,"Of all the 30 Rock shows to do, why not Homonym?"
Bottom,DILF Manor when?
Bottom,the bar for entertainment has fallen so fucking low. it's astounding.
Bottom,Coming soon - some show about a pain threshold. “How much pain are YOU willing to withstand for A MILLION DOLLARS!”
Bottom,These sound like shoes that would be mentioned on 30 Rock....
Bottom,Nothing deserves to be mentioned as bottom of the barrel as Dana White's Power Slap just weeks after video came out of him slapping his wife
Bottom,Reminds me of 30 Rock when Jack is trying to tank NBC. I would watch the shit out of Celebrity Homonym!!!
Bottom,"Wait is there really something called ""MILF Manor"".  Did 30 Rock call another show with its ""MILF Island""?"
Bottom,he's the worst. How does he keep getting jobs?
Bottom,I love how most of these comments are pearl clutching about the obviously fake reality show instead of the real CTE factory that is Power Slap. It's fascinating how Americans will always be more uncomfortable with sex than violence
Bottom,I tried watching MILF Manor last night. I couldn’t even get through the first episode. I immediately turned it off when the MILFs were told they were to be blindfolded and feel all the shirtless sons and then guess which upper body felt like their OWN SONS. I love trash tv but that was disturbing.
Bottom,I’ll be honest. I’m really enjoying MILF Manor.
Bottom,That power slap show is legitimately going to wind up getting someone killed. I honestly cannot fathom how anyone thinks that is a good idea. Whatever athletics comission approved it should be ashamed of themselves.
Bottom,"We truly are living in Idiocracy. 

TLC used to be quality, educational programming. A&E (Arts & Entertainment) is another channel that has turned into trash TV. That used to be highbrow type shows. Now when I flip by it, it’s shows featuring YouTube videos of moron neighbors getting in fights with each other or some staged nonsense about dirtbags buying abandoned storage lockers."
Bottom,Island. MILF Island. C’mon people…
Bottom,Photo on right is NOT from the show in question
Bottom,"WTH, i thought this was a 30 Rock reference to highlight how bad reality shows have become, only to see its real? 

How sad is it that what was once a joke to parody and show something extremely absurd and devoid of any actual thought, to now being an actual thing? 

We really are living in the worst timeline."
Bottom,"That's not true. When networks unironically air Ow, my balls. Then we'll be at the bottom of the barrel. 

Though power slap is pretty close I'll give you that."
Bottom,"Mill island, Deborah vs Dee-bore-ah"
Bottom,We’ve learned that the Australian versions of most of these reality shows are way better and mostly watch those now.
Bottom,"Lol, I have just seen the promos for them, & I still think there's far worse. It's not like variations of these have not been around for quite some time."
Bottom,Does Milf Manor have an erection cove?
Bottom,"Milf manor is boring to me.  It's so dumb.  I think they thought it would be shocking, but it comes off like a weird family reunion, not a dating show."
Bottom,"The problem with Milf Manor is they aren't milfs in any respect at all.  Could they find a more wrecked lineup?   MINF Manor perhaps... mom's I'd never fuck.  If they were hot, it actually might be a good show!"
Bottom,"FTA: *""Why? Because any cable network that is willing to make a show that will be immediately compared to 30 Rock’s MILF Island knows that it’s putting on a trainwreck of a show that’s there to just attract buzz and eyeballs.""*

So, it will make money.  They put on shit and people watch it.  Why?  Because people will do anything to be entertained and distracted.  If you don't like it, don't watch."
Bottom,Thank god he’s in charge of hbo /s
Bottom,It's not TV is HB...What the fuck is this dog shit!
Bottom,"Shows straight out of Idiocracy, I love it."
Bottom,"Im just going to keep saying this 

This goes to show that ZERO executives at these networks understand how to tell a story. They rely on freak-show performers and big top circus desperation. WOLFMAN!!  Not a single executive at Discovery, HGTV, TLC,  could plot there way out of paper bag. And they’re like “why is everyone streaming?” And then they green-light milf manner. Bags of dicks."
Bottom,Can we please stop call what these people are doing slapping. When you put enough force into your strike cause folks to lose consciousness it’s no longer slapping it’s open handed blows .
Bottom,"I blame Mythbusters. It was a great show, one of my favorites and ever since then, networks have tried pushing all sorts of reality based garbage on tv. 

There are no more animals on Discovery, no actual history on the History Channel, no more animals on Animal Planet....etc..just garbage."
Bottom,I am so stoked to watch Milf Manor. This has to be the best content on tv right now
Bottom,"The show sounds like straight up porn without the nudes. lol. Brilliant if it ignites the culture for older women to love younger guys. I love older hot women. Would love to date older women. But older women are generally conservative and not into younger men. They might be inspired to be more open minded after the show becomes more popular. Nothing gets my pipi harder than a hot 40+. For real. I'm mid 30's myself so shouldn't really call them older women lol. 

I feel like the controversy around the show is promo hype. lol. No way reality tv show watchers are cringed by this. All of these shows are cringe by design. That's what people like. Also, looked up the cast. The women aren't all that good compared to really hot older women. But they probably tried to recruit older women with sons. So that reduced who they could recruit. Ridiculous. Why not fake the sons and recruit like the hottest older women with the right demeanor? Then reveal that the sons are all fake later."
Bottom,"The bottom of the barrel has been long gone, they are scratching up the floor now."
Bottom,Fahrenheit 451 just keeps getting closer and closer to reality.
Bottom,"In a long enough timeline, late stage capitalism drags everything through the mud."
Bottom,"This is embarrassing. Face slapping might as well be “Ow My Balls”. “Mothers I’d like to Fuck” should not be an acceptable term for a public tv format. 

We are reveling in our basest nature likes pigs in slop. Stop championing idiocy."
Bottom,Supply and demand people!
Bottom,Girls gone wild has become Idiots gone wild.
Bottom,This guy cancelled all those tv shows/movies for this shit.
Bottom,"The writer says they were revolted (after being excited) to watch Milf Manor because of the content....  
  
.....yeah, it's trash TV and you were given trash content."
Bottom,"It has done for a long time, dance moms, fuckin honey boo boo. I’m sure they will put out something even shitter than this."
Bottom,"Yet HBO Max doesn't have CatHouse, Real Sex, or Katie Morgan's shows

They pretend to be above it all with the soft core stuff, but the shitty reality junk is acceptable?

It makes no sense pretending that HBO Max is a ""premium content"" provider when I have to ignore all the stupid TLC Home Renovation shows 


I shouldn't know who Joanna Gaines is

Painting everything white isn't renovating"
Bottom,Bottom of the barrel? Milf Manor is an unpacking of the oedipal complex like mass audiences have never seen. This is a huge cultural moment millennia in the making. 90 Day Fiance is a fascinating study of people with little cultural overlap finding a balance between love and their ambitions for a better life. This man makes high brow trash TV and hardly has to rely on queues or scripts to give his subjects life. Give him a Pulitzer.
Bottom,Wait milf manor is a real show… wasn’t that a parody in some sitcom like community or something?
Bottom,"Yes, this is the content we really need, not another season of scripted shows like Westworld. :s"
Bottom,Let’s be clear it’s not actually called MILF Manor … it’s called Mom’s I’d like to Fuck Manor….
Bottom,Maybe get some real milfs. These are just trashy women that already hit the wall
Bottom,[deleted]
Bottom,"just body after body, falling out of shit wood and hitting pavement."
Bottom,"They said that to me, at a dinner."
Bottom,"Honestly, that sketch has no business making me laugh as much as it did but it’s probably because I’m so tired. I spent all of my per diem on shirts at Dan Flashes’, so it’s probably starvation related."
Bottom,Hours of body breaking through shit wood and hitting pavement
Bottom,I didn’t do fuckin’ shit
Bottom,In Fear Factor from the early 2000s they would put people in a glass coffin and cover them with bugs and spiders and snakes. It was really trashy.
Bottom,Please tell me they got Darby Allin to do that. Delicious corporate synergy!
Bottom,Normally the porn industry does the parody of the mainstream show or movie not the other way around.
Bottom,That sounds exactly like a Japanese porn parody gameshow.
Bottom,"


I really wonder target demo 😶"
Bottom,Imagine if this show was called “DILF Manor” and the contestants are dads dating each other’s daughters… And I’m probably giving these fucks more sick ideas…
Bottom,They really gave someone a ton of money just to live out their weird incest fantasies.
Bottom,so.. they saw the 30 rock episode with MILF island and made an actual tv show
Bottom,Isn't this literally an episode of 30 rock
Bottom,House of the Dragon’s incest walked so MILF Manor incest could fly
Bottom,"I told my wife when we saw the promo’s for it and they talked about twist that they would be going after each others sons. 

She didn’t believe me…"
Bottom,"When the show was first announced a whole bunch of people guessed that would be the premise. I've never been more disappointed that we were not wrong. 

Hopefully those poor kids were there because they want to be, and not because they felt pressured by their moms."
Bottom,LMAO I called that twist back when the trailer first came out.
Bottom,We truly are back in the early 00s era of reality shows not giving a damn about taste 😬
Bottom,So someone snuck their incest kink into a “legit” reality television program.
Bottom,"So, not just MILFs but also casual incest? Yeah, great concept. How did this ever get greenlit?!"
Bottom,I’ve been watching the show with the growing fan/onlooker community at r/milfmanor. The show is INSANE.
Bottom,"I tried watching it for the cringe. It's not even cringe, just absolute shit."
Bottom,"Wait, they'll date their own sons, or will they date a son from another MILF? I feel like this needs clarification."
Bottom,The show it was based on was worse. They were clearly children in that one.
Bottom,30 Rocks MILF Island. This is insane.
Bottom,"Oh it gets better, the mother and son also have to share a bedroom while both are trying to get laid... it's like swinging but more incestuous."
Bottom,Finally! Something I haven't seen on TV before. I actually applaud them for going full monty.
Bottom,This is the moment I turned off the show. I was struggling trying to get into it but then this challenge was revealed. NOPE. GROSS
Bottom,"I think that's hilarious considering ""cougars"" are not new by any means, and the guys they ""date"" are someone's son. Lifetime network made it rich by using that as drama."
Bottom,I FUCKING KNEW THAT WAS THE TWIST!!!
Bottom,"Somebody watched that movie starring Robin Wright and Naomi Watts, where they fuck each other’s sons and decided to make a reality show about it.  I can’t wait to see what this “genius” makes for HBO.

Edit: the movie is called “Adore”"
Bottom,"I really thought that when Power Slap was announced, it was an article from the Onion."
Bottom,"The thing is, I'm not sure hate-watching is as viable a model on a subcription streamer as it was when Zaslav was turning Discovery into this kind of turd fountain. If you're watching regular tv and you skim past it, sure, you might stop to rubberneck, but I have my doubts people subscribe to a service with that as the core offering on that basis."
Bottom,"Or, as I like to put it:

DOING SOMETHING IRONICALLY *IS STILL FUCKING DOING IT.*"
Bottom,"Mitchell and Webb really did [nail it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ss-59fi4nM), back in the day.

*""So it’s coverage of idiots behaving idiotically for an audience of idiots?""*

*""It’s not just an audience of idiots. There’ll be a lot of other people who flatter themselves they’re watching with a sense of irony, and in some way haven’t been taken in.""*

*""And remind me: how do these ironic non-idiots show up in the ratings?”*

*""They show up the same, my friend. They show up just the same.""*"
Bottom,"Zazlav might not be hitting Reddit numbers. But on Youtube, every knuckle dragging reactor is making videos on all these shows Zazlav is putting out on HBO max."
Bottom,"I've been ignoring all of that shit the entire time. The Kardashians, Real Housewives of whothefuckcares, The Bachelor/ette,  Ow! My Balls, FBoy Island, etc. Don't seem to be making a dent. I've been doing my part, whatever you can do to get everyone else on board, I am for it."
Bottom,I remember when Fox had their man vs animal prime time special in the early 2000s where a dude raced a giraffe on prime time TV. Apparently it’s really been all downhill since then.
Bottom,"Next week on ""the Deepest Bottom,"" find out who can shove an entire butternut squash up their ass!"
Bottom,I'll buy that for a dollar!
Black Books,"“It’s perfectly simple: There’s the academic who survived the Stalinist purges and is now having flashbacks, his daughter whose long bitter marriage is collapsing around her and the journalist who is investigating the academic because he suspects he was never in Russia at the time and who falls obsessively in love with the daughter and then sacrifices his whole career to become a lens grinder in Omsk. 

What’s the problem? I don’t think we should talk down to children.”"
Black Books,I’m just strolling up the beach with my discreetly pregnant Brazilian girlfriend.
Black Books,I love this show so much.
Black Books,"""You always know you're in for a good night when there's a polar bear bleeding on the label."""
Black Books,*I ATE ALL YOUR BEES*
Black Books,"I used to be a canoe guide and played a game with the kids where they would stand up and everytime I said a word beginning with the letter B the had to do a little jump in the boat. The story was about Bill Bailey and Bernard Black who worked in a book shop. I always made it up on the spot but always incorporated the ""Bernard, Bernard, Bernard......"" Bit from ""I'm a prostitute robot from the future"" over and over and ended with them writing a story book about a balloon. Simpler times."
Black Books,"Not what this post is about, but I just have to say the Grapes of Wrath episode is one of the best things I’ve ever seen on television."
Black Books,Not anything goes! I said NO RULES!
Black Books,The writing in this show is fantastic. Must have seen all of them 20 tines and still this clip had me laughing kinda loudly. maybe time for another rewatch
Black Books,I bought my husband the little book of calm before he went on deployment.
Black Books,"Oh man, thanks for the reminder! Time to pull the set out and have a rewatch :D"
Black Books,Prop comedy done right
Black Books,"Bernard, it's hot in the worm!"
Black Books,They ALL drink LEMoNADE....

Black Books,I really wanted a copy of the book for my kids :P  Found some people had made themselves but nothing ever official.
Black Books,Oh no!  I left my keys in my Kong Hong house!
Black Books,"This show is so goddamn funny. The cleaning guy, the moths , the shrinking flat, Manny’s hair. Comic fried gold."
Black Books,About as funny as toothache
Black Books,I can hear all of your comments in their voices.
Black Books,There’s an extra on the Black Books DVD where this novel is rejected by a publishers. Bernard writes a [scathing response](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Me0aYMZtzQ)
Black Books,I've said for years that I would genuinely read that book.
Black Books,"And then the beach, laden with paparazzi, and I’ll say “no! Take a photo of me if you must, but leave her out of it! She’s just an ordinary lingerie model!”"
Black Books,"""My location is... bookshop!"""
Black Books,“There was a little man in his hair!”
Black Books,"My favourite line of the whole show is when Manny accuses Bernard for not having any taste left from all his smoking. Bernard replies that he has excellent taste, how else would he enjoy this delicious cookie? 
""That's a coaster."""
Black Books,"You can only comment on this video here.

That other video, with all the dust and everything? Out of bounds!

Only this video here, with the clean videos, some with price tags still on them."
Black Books,Fizzy good make-feel-nice!!!
Black Books,I'm writing down MOUSE.
Black Books,It's like trying to talk about the difference between a No Holds Barred and a No DQ match in wrestling.
Black Books,I quote this so often!
Black Books,Did he swallow it?
Black Books,"As would I. In fact, I have thought of writing that novel."
Black Books,I'm a good little soldier.
Black Books,"The buildup to this, and the entire scene was quite possibly the funniest thing I have ever seen on a TV show."
Black Books,"Bernard : It's all waffle! Nobody is prepared to admit that wine doesn't have a taste.

Manny : Of course you can't taste anything, you smoke eighty bajillion cigarettes a day. What's that you're eating?

Bernard : It's some sort of delicious biscuit.

Manny : It's a coaster!

Bernard : Are there any more?


I love the cadence of how Moran speaks, how the emphasis is all over the place."
Black Books,He lives in... a bottle bank!
Black Books,"Don't make me laugh, bitterly."
Black Books,Sadly no
Black Books,"Simon Pegg's my favorite cameo.

""Remember, selling books is a game. And like any game, it has rules. And you need to learn the rules and get serious about them, because this *isn't a game*."""
Black Books,"It's really good, Dylan Moran is really really great at playing Exasperated Smart Guy."
Black Books,“You know what you are? You’re a beard with an idiot attached to it.”  Best insult ever. 
Black Books,Whores will have their trinkets.
Black Books,"""Millwall, Millwall, you're so dreadful, and all your girlfriends are unfulfilled and alienated!"""
Black Books,"What is your mother’s maiden name?
“Her maiden name?! I don’t even know her first name! I just knew her as Ma! That’ll have to do” "
Black Books,Love Black Books.  Dylan Moran and Bill Bailey have some great stand up shows as well.  Check out Green Wing for more surreal UK comedy.
Black Books,I would watch it but right now I'm busy eating scrambled eggs from a shoe with a Combe.
Black Books,The frozen wine bottle popsicle always makes me giggle when I see it!
Black Books,"The episode where Bernard gets locked out is one of my favourites.

“Welcome to.. the thing.. whatever this place is”"
Black Books,Omid dhjali as Mannys pimp is my personal fav!
Black Books,Nick the Accountant. Nick the Accountant. IS A FUGITIVE!
Black Books,Half ten!? I've never been awake at half ten what happens?
Black Books,[deleted]
Black Books,Dylan Moran working briefly in the fast food restaurant is one of the funniest things I've ever seen on TV.
Black Books,"I thought it was mostly fantastic. I think my favorite episode was the one with the children's book. Sometimes I like to think that Bernard is a crazy old Time Lord who retired on Earth and stopped giving fucks long ago. It would explain how relatively durable he is, how the shop stays open, and how he could type a 1000+ page Russian epic in a night or two."
Black Books,[deleted]
Black Books,"One of my favourite moments (and I know describing visual comedy is an arrestable offense) is when Manny is lamenting to Bernard how bereft of customers the shop is when a fly buzzes in through the open front door, buzzes around the empty shop (portrayed with mild camera work and sfx) before buzzing back out the front door.  And it closes the door behind itself.

Such a weird show."
Black Books,"This is for sure a Top 5 favorite show for me. Dylan Moran as Bernard has to be among the funniest, most relatably curmudgeon of all time. If you ever wondered what Spongebob would be like if it was from Squidward’s perspective, this is it."
Black Books,"'There's the elephant'

'He's happy with his balloon'

'Oh no! It's gone...'"
Black Books,I love the part where he finds a mushroom in his hair and eats it
Black Books,"It's some sort of delicious biscuit 

...it's a coaster...

WHAT?!  Is there any more?!"
Black Books,That wine episode is the best!
Black Books,The little book of calm had me hooked from the get go! Fav episode be them going off on holiday! Very good writing. I highly recommend seeing Dylan Moran's stand-up comedy if you lile Black Books. 
Black Books,"It's one of those shows that I didn't really feel at first, but I stuck with it and after a few episodes I got used to it and grew to love it. It's just so comforting and charming."
Black Books,...... Dave’s Syndrome 
Black Books,"I loved it.  Its quite offbeat in a really hilarious way.  Time to watch it again methinks, its been awhile.  I agree the cameos were the icing on the cake.  I think my favorite episode is the piano one, Bailey gave me huge belly laughs.  "
Black Books,"The episode where Manny and Bernard make wine for the pope is solid gold tele-visual magic in my book. I love two things, everybody and television, and 'Black Books' is some of the best television I've ever had the pleasure of enjoying. "
Black Books,I recreated the “On Phone” post-it gag with a customer once. It didn’t go down as well. 
Black Books,"""She's playing with fire.  He's not ready for Nibbly Pig!"" "
Black Books,"As a sufferer of Dave's Syndrome, I found it to be very sensitively handled."
Black Books,"That was the first British show that I watched that was deeply British.  Meaning, I understood the words, but damned if I didn't get confused by the references. I had seen Spaced and was hungry for more. It was a good fit though and started me down the rabbit hole of awesome TV."
Black Books,"Is space hot?

Of course it is, where do you think we get pineapples?

Second time today I got to use that. "
Black Books,Favorite episode is when he is locked out and gets a job serving fast food so he doesn't have to be out in the rain 
Black Books,"When you’re feeling under pressure, do something different. Roll up your sleeves, or eat an orange."
Black Books,My absolute favourite tv show! Every single line is a classic. Does make me want to chain smoke though 🤔
Black Books," Absolutely loved Black Books. Kevin Eldon cameo as The Cleaner was amazing (check out his imdb by the way, including his first film which will surprise you.  Lol I sound like fucking clickbait).

Check out Friday Night Dinner, if you haven't seen it already!"
Black Books,"*Reads that you can get an extension on tax return due to injury*

Black Books,I once annoyed Dylan Moran in the Carwash pub in Edinburgh. It was <exactly> like meeting Bernard Black.
Black Books,"One of my favourite scenes is when Bill Bailey gets locked inside the shop, gets drunk on a shot’s worth of absinthe and roasts a bumble bee for food. 

Laughed for days when I first saw that. "
Black Books,Simon Pegg as Manny's boss at the rival bookshop made me appreciate Simon Pegg for the first time
Black Books,He was sat there...sucking his trousers...and LAUGHING!
Black Books,One of my favorite shows of all time 
Black Books,"Fantastic series.

""We'll make some more! Mix in some of the cheap stuff, he'll never know the difference.""

""But he's the Pope. He's used to the finer things."""
Black Books,"The episode where they created a new bottle of wine from an old expensive one had me in stitches. 
"
Black Books,"I identify so thoroughly with the line ""I've never been up at half-ten! What happens?"""
Black Books,"Dylan's stand up is great too, was lucky to see him in Clevend a couple of years ago."
Black Books,"Love the living hell out of that show. Tried it on a whim. Unfortunately Netflix dropped it before I saw the last episode or two. 
Totally fell for Tamsin Greig. Funny and sexy. Wow!"
Black Books,"The one where Manny discovers he can play the piano.

Did not realise Bill Bailey was such a good muso."
Black Books,"One of my favorite Peter Serafinowicz minor roles. Fran loves his character's voice, but thinks he's a jerk, so she's going to listen to him on the radio and have some ""alone time.""

He stops ""prematurely,"" so she calls him and he assumes something's wrong.

""I'll come over, Fran. Fran! I'm coming, Fran! I'm coming!""

Fran: <ORGASMIC SHRIEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEK>"
Black Books,"""You really believed that Apes could have meetings."" "
Black Books,Love. It. Dylan did an AMA the other week!
Black Books,Bernard attempting to complete his tax return always has me in hysterics!
Black Books,"I saw Bill Bailey live on Thursday and he said people all over the world still point at him, make cone shapes over their chest with their hands and chant ‘Bernard Bernard Bernard’ at him
"
Black Books,"I love British comedies, thanks for the recommendation. 

There's a great one on Netflix that unfortunately didn't get renewed for a season 2: ""Crazy Head"". It's not your typical dry British comedy though. 

I used to watch Vicar of Dibley, Father Ted, Drop the Dead Donkey, 'Allo 'Allo, Fawlty Towers and Absolutely Fabulous"
Black Books,"Oh HELL yes! 
“What’s that?” 
“What?”
“What are you eating?”
“It’s some sort of delicious biscuit.”
“It’s a coaster.”
“Is it? Are there any more?”"
Black Books,"I feel strangely that Black Books is kinda a precursor possible influence for Always Sunny. Horrible people and their hijinx. Well not Manny, he's a saint."

Walking with Dinosaurs: The Ballad of Big Al,This exact comment is LITERALLY the top comment of every Hollywood Star post on this subreddit. Also the cost is primarily towards actually installing it into the Walk of Fame.

Walking with Dinosaurs: The Ballad of Big Al,Donald Trump literally had one lol
Walking with Dinosaurs: The Ballad of Big Al,Busey's insane monologue about his dog is worth the price of admission alone.
Walking with Dinosaurs: The Ballad of Big Al,Fully expecting them to wrap it up so they can incorporate some characters into the other upcoming TWD spin offs and ultimately a grand finale that ties all of them together.
Walking with Dinosaurs: The Ballad of Big Al,TIL this show went more than 3 seasons
Walking with Dinosaurs: The Ballad of Big Al,FTWD after season 3 varied from passable at best to utterly appalling
Walking with Dinosaurs: The Ballad of Big Al,"This franchise is basically a zombie at this point. I keep thinking it's over, then I hear about it continuing to limp on"
Walking with Dinosaurs: The Ballad of Big Al,"Always nice to hear that a show will end. Not get canceled, but getting the opportunity to wrap things up."
Walking with Dinosaurs: The Ballad of Big Al,"I still stand by the first three seasons being genuinely great TV, and some of season six too. But I’ll always be sad we didn’t get to see the og vision for the story, and how bad it got. 

(It’s wild too how the pilot is still the highest viewed premiere for a tv series in history in terms of same day viewers)"
Walking with Dinosaurs: The Ballad of Big Al,I didn’t even realize they made it this far
Walking with Dinosaurs: The Ballad of Big Al,Name a more flogged dead horse. I’ll wait.
Walking with Dinosaurs: The Ballad of Big Al,"For me, the show went downhill after Morgan came on.  Before then it wasn't perfect, but was different enough to be interesting.  And season 3 was particularly interesting IMO.  After that, it kind of became The Walking Dead 2.0, and while it did have its moments (John's character was a great addition), it was actually weaker than the main show, which was already getting a bit stale.  I do look forward to seeing how it ends, I just hope it's much better than last season was (my least favorite, easily)."
Walking with Dinosaurs: The Ballad of Big Al,"this show has been on for EIGHT seasons??  


who has been watching this??"
Walking with Dinosaurs: The Ballad of Big Al,"Wait, did Madison come back? I stopped watching around the time when they got rid of (what felt like) 60% of the cast, including her. I was a fan when Madison, Travis, Nick, and Alicia were the main focus."
Walking with Dinosaurs: The Ballad of Big Al,Between this and the main show there's 19 seasons of Walking Dead tv so far. Everyone here is making fun of it but somewhere Robert Kirkman is sitting on a throne of money.
Walking with Dinosaurs: The Ballad of Big Al,AMC is the opposite of Netflix. Run a show too long
Walking with Dinosaurs: The Ballad of Big Al,At least it will end with Maddison
Walking with Dinosaurs: The Ballad of Big Al,Who watched this?
Walking with Dinosaurs: The Ballad of Big Al,This show is still on?!
Walking with Dinosaurs: The Ballad of Big Al,But where will we turn to for redundant stories about walking and zombies and 'oh noes humans are the real monsters'?
Walking with Dinosaurs: The Ballad of Big Al,Getting rid of Kim dickins for the bloke from twd was a travesty and where I checked the f out.
Walking with Dinosaurs: The Ballad of Big Al,"I'm kind of amazed this show still has an audience.  The first season was so bad I checked out.   Now we have 2 more spin-offs, but is there an audience?"
Walking with Dinosaurs: The Ballad of Big Al,This actually got 8 seasons. AMC really doesn’t know what to do lol
Walking with Dinosaurs: The Ballad of Big Al,"This show had no real plot after they switched showrunners, they would just find themselves in a new annoying situation every 8 to 12 episodes."
Walking with Dinosaurs: The Ballad of Big Al,The show that won’t die
Walking with Dinosaurs: The Ballad of Big Al,I didnt even realise this was still going??!?!
Walking with Dinosaurs: The Ballad of Big Al,How does this series stack up to TWD? I liked TWD enough but stopped with Negan’s introduction / the ridiculous fake out with Glen.
Walking with Dinosaurs: The Ballad of Big Al,Should have ended before Alycia left. Now it’s pointless.
Walking with Dinosaurs: The Ballad of Big Al,AMC will never kill Walking Dead. What other IP do they even have now?
Walking with Dinosaurs: The Ballad of Big Al,Totally forgot this existed
Walking with Dinosaurs: The Ballad of Big Al,About 5 seasons too late.
Walking with Dinosaurs: The Ballad of Big Al,What? That show has more than one season?
Walking with Dinosaurs: The Ballad of Big Al,I stopped when they were on that boat.  Bored to tears
Walking with Dinosaurs: The Ballad of Big Al,That shit ended like episode 3.
Walking with Dinosaurs: The Ballad of Big Al,Ahh 8 seasons to late I see
Walking with Dinosaurs: The Ballad of Big Al,This show was still going on? Lol
Walking with Dinosaurs: The Ballad of Big Al,"The quality of this series has been so up and down - but there have been times it was telling a far more interesting zombie/apocalypse story than TWD was. I stuck with it even through some very questionable storylines but there have been some great parts to it. Glad it’s ending though - I would guess some characters will go to the other projects, and I reckon the finale will be better than TWDs “Next, on the Walking Dead Universe” bullshit"
Walking with Dinosaurs: The Ballad of Big Al,"But its going to set up another 3 or 4 spin-offs first, right?"
Walking with Dinosaurs: The Ballad of Big Al,Can’t believe this show has 8 seasons. Walking dead killed all zombie enjoyment for me
Walking with Dinosaurs: The Ballad of Big Al,About 5 seasons too late for me.
Walking with Dinosaurs: The Ballad of Big Al,Could anyone tell me if this show contributed any story lore relevant to the walking dead? I stopped watching after crack Johnny deep died and they left the Mexican community. But i do know that morgan appeared
Walking with Dinosaurs: The Ballad of Big Al,"Ya seen one dead guy with a scary weapon, ya seen ‘em all. 🙄"
Walking with Dinosaurs: The Ballad of Big Al,I stopped watching when the nuclear missiles were launched! I just lost interest!
Walking with Dinosaurs: The Ballad of Big Al,"""Fear the Walking Dead’ Ended With Season 2 at my house."
Walking with Dinosaurs: The Ballad of Big Al,I can’t believe this franchise still exists. I never got into it but I certainly see endless complaints about quality about both shows. Apparently they’re even doing new spin-offs? How far off would I be to dub this Zombie Greys Anatomy?
Walking with Dinosaurs: The Ballad of Big Al,"I tried to get into this show, but couldn't get through the first season.  I honestly thought it was cancelled after season 1 or 2, so was a surprise to hear it went on for 8.  May need to try again, as I've been hearing good things about the later seasons."
Walking with Dinosaurs: The Ballad of Big Al,People are watching this show?
Walking with Dinosaurs: The Ballad of Big Al,Yet another Walking Dead show that lasted WAAAAY too long.
Walking with Dinosaurs: The Ballad of Big Al,This shit went on for 8 years?? Lol
Walking with Dinosaurs: The Ballad of Big Al,4 seasons too late holy fucking shit!
Walking with Dinosaurs: The Ballad of Big Al,8 SEASONS? I didn't even know this show was out.  Is time linear???
Walking with Dinosaurs: The Ballad of Big Al,"thank you, they ruined Fear the Walking Dead when they rebooted it"
Walking with Dinosaurs: The Ballad of Big Al,The writing FTWD got so so comically bad.
Walking with Dinosaurs: The Ballad of Big Al,Season 7 was so bad that i stopped watching. AI would make more sensible script.
Walking with Dinosaurs: The Ballad of Big Al,"Yay! Happy happy fucking joy!!!

I liked this show, I will admit it. It did a lot of stuff, for better or for worse, that The Walking Dead didn't. The first, second and third seasons established a great tone, set during and directly after the zombie apocalypse, and season 3 in particular was brutally good.

Season 4 came along, as did the current cast of characters and, while the show did become ""Morgan and Friends"" it still had its moments. Loved having the mobile troop carrier as a thing. Zombies in a waterpark. The episode in the hurricane (I always want weather to be a bigger part of these shows, and loved when TWD had one in the snow, but didn't have ""weather is an enemy"" as big).

Season 6, the show finally became mostly consistently good again. Early season 6 was a highlight, as the characters became scattered throughout Virginia's empire. Great that Virginia went full Negan and the show actually decided ""fuck it, let's kill her"".

But then season 7 was a huge disappointment. A nuclear zombie apocalypse should have been so much cooler, instead it felt turgid. Strand being the villain - I can go with that, that's cool, but you can't forgive him for all the shit he did at the end and row off into the sunset singing Kumbaya.

So yes, I'm glad this is ending, and hopefully a decent, conclusive ending. It's certainly been a rollercoaster in quality, and could have been way more. In the end, it just became a gritty TWD clone."
Walking with Dinosaurs: The Ballad of Big Al,Who is still watching this? Is anyone from the original cast even still on this show? I watched the first two seasons and thought it was painfully mediocre so I checked out. Honestly can’t believe it’s still going.
Walking with Dinosaurs: The Ballad of Big Al,It went 8 seasons? Do they ever explain what caused the zombie apocalypse?
Walking with Dinosaurs: The Ballad of Big Al,I’m sure all of their fan will be heartbroken :(
Walking with Dinosaurs: The Ballad of Big Al,"Holy shit. This is still on the air. 8 seasons? Wow. Serious question: is it any good ? 

I remember watching the beginning and thinking it was such an awesome concept. They never showed twd universe actually collapsing, just Rick waking up like 6 (?) months into it. I was so excited to see it. Then they pretty much glossed over it in the first few episodes of the first season. Then I kinda had hopes that they would be standalone seasons and show different parts of the world during the collapse and how they handled it. That never happened. Then I heard they killed off like the entire family from the beginning. So I just lost interest. As I did with the rest of the twd universe."
Walking with Dinosaurs: The Ballad of Big Al,"Season one sucked. Season two sucked. Season three was awesome, so they decided to soft reboot it in season four. !?!?!
If the TWD universe ever comes to an end, the “geniuses” behind it should take their talent to Congress where they’ll fit right in."
Walking with Dinosaurs: The Ballad of Big Al,Holy hell this show got EIGHT seasons????
Walking with Dinosaurs: The Ballad of Big Al,I can’t believe people so watch this
Walking with Dinosaurs: The Ballad of Big Al,Can someone explain to me what “Fear the Walking Dead” is.   I haven’t watched anything Walking Dead related since like the second season of the original show and I’m totally out of the loop
Walking with Dinosaurs: The Ballad of Big Al,Holy crap that show is still going
Walking with Dinosaurs: The Ballad of Big Al,There were 8 seasons?
Walking with Dinosaurs: The Ballad of Big Al,8 seasons longer than it should have

As a trans woman who's father killed himself out of the pain of being a trans woman in denial, it kind of hits a bit close to home.  Crossdressers don't wish they were girls, unless they are in fact girls.

The song isn't inherently hateful, but the fact its supposed to be a comedy when its about a deadly serious issue is something I take offense to.  Like, oh here's someone grappling with who they are and in denial about it, haha how embarrassing.  The humor comes entirely from the mocking of who the singer is."

Monty Python: Almost the Truth - The Lawyers Cut,"As also a bonafide trans person, the song itself isn't inherently bad, it's the ridicule that's thrown towards the lumberjack by the real-world audience."
Monty Python: Almost the Truth - The Lawyers Cut,What a thought provoking response. Really adds to the conversation.
Monty Python: Almost the Truth - The Lawyers Cut,More thought provoking than shitty Monty Python humor.
Monty Python: Almost the Truth - The Lawyers Cut,"Hey, /u/kevonicus... Why don't you sit on my face, and tell me that you love me."
Monty Python: Almost the Truth - The Lawyers Cut, Argument is an intellectual process. Contradiction is just the automatic gainsaying of anything the other person says.

Monty Python: Almost the Truth - The Lawyers Cut,I finally understand why Doctor Who fans loved David Tennant.
Monty Python: Almost the Truth - The Lawyers Cut,Feels just like HGTTG. There was even the little bit about dolphins in the first episode lol
Monty Python: Almost the Truth - The Lawyers Cut,"If you loved the book, you'll love the show. I get it's the shtick of the book but the tangents got a bit old IMO so it works better for me in the TV show that they're reduced. 

David Tennant and Michael Sheen are pitch perfect. Some of the best casting I've ever seen. I also loved Jon Hamm. The kids though.... Didn't like them in the books, don't like them in the show."
Monty Python: Almost the Truth - The Lawyers Cut,"Damn Good Omens knocked it out of the park.  

I'm a book reader, though, how did people new to Crowley & friends find it?"

Monty Python: Almost the Truth - The Lawyers Cut,"I binged it. Didn't love the last episode but the rest were quite good.

I think my enjoyment of the series wouldn't have been that high if I hadn't read the book though. It does a very good job adapting the book. That is until the last episode which is a bit rocky. Still good, just not as good as the rest."
Monty Python: Almost the Truth - The Lawyers Cut,yall think the show is alright for kids to watch?
