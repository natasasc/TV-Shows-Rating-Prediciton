TV Show,Comment
Life in Pieces,"This was my comfort food show for 3 years and to this day haven't found another one since. 

Perfect sitcom, lighthearted, fun, refrains from ever gettin' too dramatic and I can't tell you enough how refreshing that was for me at the time. No relationship drama, no will-they-wont-theys, no depressed characters etc. Just a family, having fun, living life, doing family things, going through typical real-life issues that most families have."
Life in Pieces,"Because it ran for four seasons on network TV and you're just watching it *now* on Netflix.

>but some of these newer shows aren’t getting a fair chance.

It got *4* seasons on CBS's monster night (Big Bang Theory, Mom) and it couldn't hold the audience.

There's not getting a chance and then there's getting *every* chance."
Life in Pieces,"Because CBS didn't own it. In the current tv landscape, a licensed show needs really monster ratings, comparatively, to make enough money to justify keeping it on the network. They'd rather cancel it and give the airtime to shows they own. Even with lower ratings, they will do better in the long run."

Life in Pieces,I loved that show. I was so bummed when they cancelled it.
Life in Pieces,Cause some of us watched it then and some of us are just watching it now....
Life in Pieces,Agreed. Was shocked. I think it had decent ratings too
Life in Pieces,Because you liked it.
Life in Pieces,"Went on too long. Amazing cast. 

Last season was wretched. 

Low ratings did it in."
Life in Pieces,Thanks to everyone on the show suggestions
Life in Pieces,100% agree! It had good ratings too it made no sense to cancel it.
Life in Pieces,"Modern Family, The Middle and Life in Pieces. These three shows make me feel relaxed and happy. There's no more shows like that :("
Life in Pieces,Try Kim’s convenience if you haven’t or Ted lasso
Life in Pieces,"Was kind of a neat format, almost like a series of short stories. Didn't try to do a big bow at the end of the episode like Modern Family, was just little snippets of the life of this family.

The young daughter ([Giselle Eisenberg](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm5338034/)) is now on American Housewife, a single cam sitcom on ABC starring Katy Mixon that's, fine I guess? It has some similar quirkiness. But I miss Life in Pieces."
Life in Pieces,So funny and true
Life in Pieces,I don’t watch much TV  & I’ve never heard about the show until Netflix you’re right. It’s a shame bc I do like it & I wish I had known about it sooner. I never seen any promotion on anything.
Life in Pieces,Ohhh okay. I had no idea. Thank you.
Life in Pieces,Yea I noticed them doing that with the characters too
Life in Pieces,I did too.
Life in Pieces,Ya that’s true too
Life in Pieces,Did it really?
Life in Pieces,I loved the cast. I’m not surprised the ratings did bad I don’t think many people knew the show even existed up until it went on streaming. You’re right the last season wasn’t the greatest.
Life in Pieces,"Second on Ted Lasso...like many others, I thought it was going to be a stupid run to long joke based on a couple youtube shorts but damn was it full of heart and genuinely engaging and fun."
Life in Pieces,I second Kim's Convenience. Never watched Ted Lasso.
Life in Pieces,"Cougartown is from the same creator as Ted Lasso, and has 6 seasons! It’s also very much funny and comforting"
Life in Pieces,"Did you watch American Housewife last night??? It was hilarious, more than usual too... I wish they would bring life in pieces back. Good comedies like that don't come along too often anymore."
Life in Pieces,"check out The Unicorn S1 on Netflix. you'll probably like it. Season 2 is airing on CBS with middling ratings, with Season 2's episodes that have aired already on CBS.com and its app."
Life in Pieces,Average to above.
Life in Pieces,Didn't know Bill Lawrence was involved with Ted Lasso.  Enough to get me to try it.
Life in Pieces,"I haven't seen any of this season, but I might have to put it on. Was initially worried it would drop off since there's been some big changes (the creator was pushed out due to discrimination allegations and the daughter changed)"
Life in Pieces,Thank you I appreciate it. I’ll check it out.
Life in Pieces,"Oh, no! Life In Pieces is one of my favorite shows. It's much different than any other sitcom on CBS, the writers have been on point since the start and the whole cast is great."
Life in Pieces,"Wtf Life in Pieces was really well written, acted, and a uniquely done sitcom."
Life in Pieces,Wtf?  Life in Pieces is brilliant .  I am really upset about this.  What idiot cancelled this amazing show?
Life in Pieces,[deleted]
Life in Pieces,Life In Pieces was legitimately hilarious.
Life in Pieces,We really enjoy Life in Pieces.
Life in Pieces,I'm so pissed about Life in Pieces. Such an amazing show! One of the funniest in a while.
Life in Pieces,DAMN IT I LOVE LIFE IN PIECES!
Life in Pieces,Dang and here I thought Life in Pieces was poised to be CBS’s chance to steal all that Modern Family audience with their final season next year.
Life in Pieces,Fuck. I love Life in Pieces. It and Brooklyn Nine-Nine are the last two sitcoms I really love watching and look forward to.
Life in Pieces,"I had no idea Life in Pieces was even back on.  I mean, they shafted it waiting this long to bring it back, but such is tv."
Life in Pieces,"Considering Life in Pieces just started airing 2 weeks ago, I'm not surprised, but I'm still upset"
Life in Pieces,I wonder if Life in Pieces can be saved by a streaming service since I seen loads of people like myself mention discovering it on Netlifx?
Life in Pieces,"Alright. What kind of food do I need to send, and to what address to save Life In Pieces!?"
Life in Pieces,Lmao at Murphy brown. Who thought that was a good idea? Also kinda hilarious Hillary was on the show before it exploded.
Life in Pieces,Life in pieces was really good
Life in Pieces,"Bro life in pieces is so good come on, unfortunately I don’t know if it has the same fan base as the shows that got saved like b99 but hopefully we can achieve something one way or another :("
Life in Pieces,I really liked Life in Pieces :/
Life in Pieces,Why the hell did Nina Dobrev leave The Vampire Diaries...
Life in Pieces,I loved Life in Pieces.
Life in Pieces,Well 4 seasons for Life in Pieces is pretty good I suppose. But why though? :(
Life in Pieces,"I could have sworn Murphy Brown got cancelled 20 years ago. 

Though maybe we need a Downtown Julie Brown show instead."
Life in Pieces,"The first 5 episodes of Fam were bloody funny, but the series trailed off badly, with only 109 (8 minutes of) and 113 also making my rewatch list."
Life in Pieces,I guess there’s going to be more of Summer Newman on The Young & the Restless soap.
Life in Pieces,"I still don't understand this. Along with The Kids Are Alright, Life was my favorite."
Life in Pieces,Life in pieces is so funny... This makes me sad.
Life in Pieces,Will Life in Pieces finish airing its ongoing season??
Life in Pieces,"Shucks. Happy Together wasn't anything special, but it was a bit of fun. Same with Fam. Nothing overly special, but still a solid sitcom. Oh well."
Life in Pieces,Lot of shows canceled this week
Life in Pieces,"I thought CBS was cancelled years ago.

Then again I'm not 65."
Life in Pieces,"Yeah my wife and I love the show. Despite our love for it, I can definitely see how it would not be everyone's favorite format."
Life in Pieces,Especially this week’s.  That’s a blow.
Life in Pieces,"It's the most wholesome show I know, every episode makes me happy"
Life in Pieces,And yet that piece of crap show “mom” has been renewed for two more seasons. I have no words
Life in Pieces,No it wasn’t.
Life in Pieces,Same cats that killed Limitless.
Life in Pieces,"Happy Together always sounded like a good sketch comedy premise, but not something that could sustain for multiple seasons. 

Murphy Brown was a show riding the nostalgia wagon, but didn’t have anything new to bring to the conversation. The original run helped shape the political sitcom voice we see today, by the modern reboot didn’t have anything to add. 

Fam felt like a slightly better version of Happy Together, but they couldn’t figure out what to do with Gary Cole. 

Life in Pieces is a gem, and never got the support it deserved from CBS."
Life in Pieces,Am I missing something here? Life in Pieces has been on for way longer than two weeks
Life in Pieces,It's on amazon prime in the uk
Life in Pieces,"It’s on Hulu in the US, not Netflix btw"
Life in Pieces,"She tried to do movies and stuff but it turns out she isn't a very good actress. I think the reason she went back tv and took the comedic Fam role was to improve and loosen up her acting. Some shows will pick her up on name alone but idk if acting is in her future anymore.

She's insanely beautiful and has a huge fanbase so fashion and modeling is still great for her though."
Life in Pieces,[deleted]
Life in Pieces,She’d be in the same boat if she didn’t leave. None of the other actors are doing anything.
Life in Pieces,"She dated her coworker and it ended badly. I thought Fam was cute. Maybe not the best sitcom ever, but cute."
Life in Pieces,"shes a reject minka kelly, changemymind"
Life in Pieces,Somewhere Dan Quayle is grinning.
Life in Pieces,Bad news for Lola.
Life in Pieces,I'm still amazed that Limitless was canceled. Such a great procedural and I was excited to see where it would go.
Life in Pieces,The current season has only been on the air for possibly a month at the most
Life in Pieces,It has had 3 seasons but season 4 just started being only 5 episodes in.
Life in Pieces,"Season 4 starting airing April 18th, so 4 weeks."
Life in Pieces,It seems to be pretty fragmented across the world.
Life in Pieces,Honestly. She hasn't aged that well. I don't know if it's the smoking or what. I do know she's still very pretty and she was incredible on tvd. Maybe she can find a similar role next.
Life in Pieces,"She left TVD a while ago like you said at the top of her game but ever since than she has been floating around not doing much of note.

Really shoukd have stuck at it."
Life in Pieces,Things got awkward between her and Ian Somerhalder after they broke up. I remember reading that he treated her like shit on set afterwords.
Life in Pieces,"Maybe, but I think she would have had more options if she had closed out the show, less burned bridges as well.

You never know though."
Life in Pieces,"I really enjoyed Fam, loved the little sister."
Life in Pieces,I always found her to be like a Victoria Justice upgrade though.
Life in Pieces,[deleted]
Life in Pieces,That makes 2 of us.
Life in Pieces,"She's definitely done well by herself, there's no denying that."
Life in Pieces,"Life in Pieces made the cut?! Awesome, but hopefully they'll have some more connecting stories again"
Life in Pieces,Honestly surprised to see this after that Bones copy fiasco.
Life in Pieces,And criminal minds continues
Life in Pieces,Criminal minds is still on air Jesus I thought it died last year. 
Life in Pieces,i sincerely hope criminal minds never ends. 
Life in Pieces,"very happy about man with a plan. I'd rather have that over Kevin can wait, but i hope that gets renewed as well. "
Life in Pieces,"And just like that, retirement communities all over the country breathe a collective sigh of relief "
Life in Pieces,"I know Criminal Minds has been divisive but man I love that show. I can never get enough, even if the seasons have not been as good since Hotch got canned. I’m really happy to see it renewed."
Minority Report,This was really dead months ago when they cut their order. 
Minority Report,I'm betting they saw this coming.
Minority Report,Still waiting on Limitless news
Minority Report,So The Nightly Show could have used that title after all. 
Minority Report,There was a Minority Report show?
Minority Report,"How do these shows ever make it pass the drawing board? I would've bet my entire bank account that this would be canceled, when it was first announced. "
Minority Report,"What is with the 2000s movie to TV fad? Limitless, rush hour, minority report."
Minority Report,"honestly, I don't know how anyone in the tv and film industry has jobs at all, let alone get paid what they do.  They're all so...*bad* at it.  Like really, *really* bad at their jobs.  Who greenlights this shit in the first place?  About a billion people could have instantly said ""that sounds dumb and no one is going to want to watch it.  Seriously, the fact that you even brought that idea to me makes me cringe so hard that my jaw has locked"" fairly instantly.  "
Minority Report,"Good, they had an opportunity to make a decent series and pissed it up the wall. I gave up after the pilot."
Minority Report,"We're running out of shows about quirky/psychic/special/ultra-smart/magic guys that team up with no nonsense female cops to solve crimes.

"
Minority Report,Abby is/was literally one of the worst actors on TV. Hopefully Sleepy Hollow can now soar without her.
Minority Report,"Wow, I didn't know the show had actually aired. Wtf? Precogs gotta give a man some warning here."
Minority Report,Not surprised. Lost interest after the first few episodes
Minority Report,"Honestly, I thought they had cancelled it a while ago."
Minority Report,Does anyone care?
Minority Report,"I don't really care about minority report, but second chance was decently decent. "
Minority Report,"I’m not caught up on Hulu. This can’t be serious – – Abbie died? What? She is the energy of the show. As much as I love Ichabod, this makes no sense."
Minority Report,What new way will they find to do procedural police shows next?
Minority Report,"Meagan Goode is nice to look at, but I've never to round her to be a very good serious actress. Not someone who who could carry a show, especially as tough-as-nails future cop."
Minority Report,I actually liked the show dammit.
Minority Report,"I’m not caught up on Hulu. This can’t be serious – – Abbie died? What? She is the energy of the show. As much as I love Ichabod, this makes no sense."
Minority Report,"Sad.

I loved the visuals, and the premise was solid. Just that it didnt shake off the cop drama stigma.

This is a show that can use the Netflix route."
Minority Report,It was reported that only a minority of FOX's viewers watched the show.
Minority Report,Supposedly being shopped to other networks currently. :(
Minority Report,"I really enjoyed the first season, it's a bit quirky but they make it work. Except that episode where they changed the words for rape, murder into things like huge and sprinkles. "
Minority Report,Ronnie thought he was going to save it.
Minority Report,Is it too late to change the name?
Minority Report,[deleted]
Minority Report,"oh there was. I know the attitude of reddit is: if its bad just ignore it, it isn't hurting you! But honestly it retro actively makes the Tom Cruise movie look worse. Which in my life is just depressing. "
Minority Report,"Watched the Pilot.

It was super boring. "
Minority Report,"Limitless is actually pretty fun, unlike the other two."
Minority Report,I heard they're even making a TV show out of Star Trek. Should have stuck with the movies.
Minority Report,"Comes in cycles. MASH, Planet of the Apes, Dukes of Hazzard, Logan's Run.  Every decade sees some group of movies try to get turned into tv shows.  Limitless, Rush Hour and Minority  Report  are just the latest.  Some are good other okay for expanding the universe and most just bad. 
Limitless I think was good in expanding the universe of a world with NZT and was generally watchable with a charasmatic lead. "
Minority Report,"And the 90s movie to tv fad too, with Fargo, from dusk till dawn, 12 monkeys"
Minority Report,You know what's more disillusioning? Think of how bad the shows are that *don't* get made. 
Minority Report,"Most people are bad at their jobs

Just the TV/movie industry has trouble hiding its failures, as you watch them, so you are more aware of it

That is why we  need to automate them."
Minority Report,"Although I seev where you're coming from, I'm reminded of a quote by Henry Ford: “if I had asked people what they wanted, they would have said faster horses.”

It takes all these failures to come across something good in my opinion. "
Minority Report,Ghosts that turn into cars.
Minority Report,Did the season (now series) end in a satisfying way?
Minority Report,"I especially love how they casually drop the major twist of the finale in the first paragraph, *then* later down the page they put a spoiler warning."
Minority Report,If only straight white males had tuned in....
Minority Report,Boo !
Minority Report,"Don't get it who downvoted you, it is true."
Minority Report,[deleted]
Minority Report,"It seems like the sort of slightly quirky show that would do better with the younger audiences watching Amazon and Netflix. I loved the first season, but the whole time I was watching it (over at my grandparents who still have satellite TV...) I knew there was no way the prime-time audience was going to get the show. I mean in one of the last episodes he made custom Arkham Horror board game cards for all the suspects...that has to be lost on the CBS audience right?"
Minority Report,Shitty. I hope it gets picked up. 
Minority Report,"I think those ""quirky"" bits are the worst part about the show. The shows goes overboard with them sometimes and it makes me tune out. "
Minority Report,I just wish they hadn't wasted the premise on yet another police procedural format show.
Minority Report,As a television show it's just yet another procedural cop drama with a gimmick. 
Minority Report,">t retro actively makes the Tom Cruise movie look worse. Which in my life is just depressing. 

Are you Tom Cruise?"
Minority Report,How does it have any bearing whatsoever on the movie?
Minority Report,Limitless is really worth watching. 
Minority Report,[deleted]
Minority Report,"It doesn't *quite* work that way though does it?

I'd expect lots of potentially great shows never make it on the air because of those same people.."
Minority Report,"No, most people are not bad at their jobs.  They may not be the best that ever lived, but they're not bad.  The movie and television industry suffers because it's nothing but nepotism and bullshit where you have to suck the right dicks or no one ever even knows you made anything (or are never given the chance to make anything).   It's a good ole boys club.  Therefore only the same extremely small group of people continue to create content and profit off of it.

I'm starting to think you may be one of the people I'm talking about."
Minority Report,"A failure here and there is expected and normal - but they're not failing on unique risks of shows.  They're failing on predictably terrible trash shows that just force some generic old concept into a movie world that just doesn't make any sense for the format.

Lost was a risk.  Breaking Bad was a risk.   The Walking Dead was a risk.  Minority Report? 12 Monkeys?  Rush Hour?  Limitless?  That's just fucking stupid.  Even when these dumb assholes can't remake yet another stupid CSI show they try to force CSI down our fucking throats.  And they wonder why nobody gives a shit about tv anymore except old people who don't know any better.

These shows aren't risks.  They're lazy.  They just repackage the same god damn stupid and boring show and slap on the title of something else that's popular for easy marketing purposes.  They make these shows instead of taking risks specifically because they think it's easy money.  But they're so fucking dumb and out of touch with society that they can't even figure out what WOULD be easy money.  Fucking morons just wasting our time and wondering why we won't subscribe to cable anymore."
Minority Report,Straight white male here. Had literally forgotten this show existed.
Minority Report,I did and it was terrible so I went back to watching top ten wall papers
Minority Report,"I quite liked it. It wasn't the greatest show on earth, but it was enjoyable."
Minority Report,Probably other networks in an attempt to lower the price.
Minority Report,"It was from a Deadline article. Supergirl has been moved from CBS to The CW.  The word is Limitless is currently unlikely to be picked up at CBS so it is being shopped to other networks. That rarely happens but it occasionally does. 

Edit: Towards the end of this article. http://deadline.com/2016/05/code-black-criminal-minds-beyond-borders-odd-couple-renewal-cbs-1201755760/"
Minority Report,While I do tend to agree with all your conclusions the ratings weren't really that bad. They weren't great but it's not like they were disastrous. I'm still pretty surprised it wasn't picked up outright. It must be fairly expensive. 
Minority Report,"I am the opposite, I love watching the show because of it. To me it is a totally different type of show I typically watch and it makes me smile and laugh a lot.  Except that one episode /u/smooth_like_a_goat mentioned, that was too much quirkiness."
Minority Report,"CBS is averse to anything procedurals due to their viewers.  Limitless would be ok on Netflix where it could continue its bizarre storytelling and quirky humor, and it could also just trash the procedural portion and make it into a 10 episode long murder mystery.  

Limitless has potential to be fun, but CBS has slowly murdered it via suffocation."
Minority Report,"Exactly, every god damn show is turned into that format. I absolutely hate this format, I have stopped even bothering to watch the first episode of these shows after I watch the trailers and realise what it is.

There is only one cop show on television currently worth watching, Brooklyn Nine Nine, and it's a comedy.

The only other decent cop shows were proper dramas like Southland, now that was a good cop show.

So much sci-fi is being ruined with this shitty format."
Minority Report,"It felt like that for the first few episodes but the ongoing story was pretty good. Have you tried watching Lucifer? God that show is painful to watch. Not only is it episodic but the main characters are so cringey. I can't stand Lucifer, the character or the show."
Minority Report,"How does that work out as a gimmick? ""Hey boss, what do you got for us to investigate today?"" ""Oh some guy was planning on killing his nanny but we arrested him before you guys came in."""
Minority Report,well thats more due to the script writing and the budget not because of the concept of the show but.......hey what do I know.
Minority Report,Am I Tom Cruise?
Minority Report,I thought it had the best pilot of all the new shows that came in the fall.
Minority Report,"It's really not at all, but I respect your opinion."
Minority Report,You're only comparing it to dexter because it has debs. 
Minority Report,I thought it was a big disappointment.  Like you said it wasn't terrible but it also wasn't special at all. A solid C. And to me that is a disappointment when I think they had a solid premise and movie as a base. 
Minority Report,Aka Amazon Prime 
Minority Report,"At this point, I'm waiting for an article titled ""CBS Getting Out of TV Game Altogether"". "
Minority Report,What are you talking about? CBS is not averse to procedurals. They they love them. Their viewers are old and old people like procedurals. NCIS. NCIS LA. Elementary. Etc. Etc. 
Minority Report,The Shield is the GOAT cop show. Old X-Files and Fringe co-runner ups. 
Minority Report,"> Have you tried watching Lucifer?

Yes, and we felt the same.  Another great premise wasted on another police procedural.

Although, we did like the guy playing Lucifer.  "
Minority Report,"It actually took place after the movie when the precog program was disbanded. One of the precogs tried to go vigilante and stop major crimes from happening on his own, but sucked at it, so a detective came in to help him. Also like in the movie, not having Agatha with him meant he didn't get whole visions which added to the conflict.  "
Minority Report,"I've not actually seen the show but what else could it possibly be? The movie plays off a personal conspiracy to give it an interesting and unique plot but a television show that's supposed to have the capability to run for years and years?

Cop procedural with a twist, precogs that can see the future *woOoOOoO*"
Minority Report,"I've never seen a ShitEatingTaco and Tom Cruise in the same room before, just sayin'"
Minority Report,Same here. 
Minority Report,I agree that it was quite decidely mediocre. It was still worth the watch on a rainy day.
Minority Report,I think he missed the word 'but' in his comment. 
Minority Report,
Minority Report,[removed]
Minority Report,As the season progressed we saw a recurring plot line involving a campaign by shadowy forces to capture the precogs for their own purposes.
Minority Report,what have you seen Tom Cruise in a room with before?
Minority Report,True. I ended up watching it all so  have to agree. 
Minority Report,Oh. Well that makes sense then. 
Minority Report,the original pilot had a lot of precog stuff. when i heard they had retooled it i didn't even bother to watch episode two.
Minority Report,Oprah comes to mind. Oprah is not Tom Cruise.
Minority Report,Bet they didn't see that coming ;)
Minority Report,"You cant slap silicon chips on a police procedural and call it sci-fi.
"
Minority Report,Same game they played with Red Band Society and it will probably end the same way
Minority Report,[deleted]
Minority Report,">Episode 10 had been designed as a fall finale, so it will now serve as a season finale (and possibly series finale).

I wonder how easily they will be able to make that change. "
Minority Report,"I've watched this, and it just has this ""90's style, low skill/effort sci-fi production"" vibe. It should be executing more like Extant's quality.
As is, The Tomorrow People was a better production than this, hell, Star-Crossed was too.

We lost Almost Human for this shit QQ."
Minority Report,There's like 10 different movies made into tv shows this season. Think i'm just gonna wait and see which ones survive.
Minority Report,Cannot believe this turd was ever allowed to air one episode.  Absolutely worst new show of the year so far.
Ushijima The Loan Shark,"Fun fact: the loan shark in this scene is played by the creator of the show, Linwood Boomer."
Ushijima The Loan Shark,Just another way of saying “I am the one who knocks”
Ushijima The Loan Shark,"honestly might be my favorite comedy show, this shit never gets old in the show"
Ushijima The Loan Shark,This is the moment Hal visited a loan shark.
Ushijima The Loan Shark,I love the scared squeal at the end. Not enough scared squeals nowadays...
Ushijima The Loan Shark,Which episode is this?
Ushijima The Loan Shark,The lengths this guy will go to to take care of his family.
Ushijima The Loan Shark,"I love Hal, such a great character."
Ushijima The Loan Shark,Makes sense. If I remember correctly this scene is in the final episode.
Ushijima The Loan Shark,I rewatched recently. Seasons 1-5 are all time great but it goes downhill after that. The characters just become caricatures of themselves.
Ushijima The Loan Shark,Graduation

Ushijima The Loan Shark,The live edition of shark tank was a failure - luckily it was (so far) a one time deal.
Ushijima The Loan Shark,">	25 years ago

I know covid has ruined everyone’s sense of time, but this is just egregiously wrong."
Ushijima The Loan Shark,The lawyer Barry Zuckerkorn jumped over a shark in Arrested Development and I thought that was pretty good.
Ushijima The Loan Shark,">25 years ago

Ah yes, 1997, I remember it well.  Seinfeld was halfway through its final season, the Beanie Baby craze was sweeping the nation, Henry Winkler turned 52, Google started up, Titanic was the biggest movie ever, and The Fonz jumped the shark.  Good times!"
Ushijima The Loan Shark,"I know it's had inconsistent writing for years, but *Fear the Walking Dead* really bit it for me this season.  Strand was a full-on psychopathic dictator who just decided to switch teams after killing countless people, and everyone was pretty much cool with it.  Alicia decided to walk off into the sunset for...reasons.  Madison came back years after her last appearance.  The endless scenes in the radioactive wasteland that was both incredibly dangerous requiring a bunch of protection and something that wasn't dangerous at all so we could see actors' faces."
Ushijima The Loan Shark,When riverdale added multiple universes and super powers it made it no longer watchable. Many would probably argue it was bad before that but the show just changed and completely fucked it’s recipe
Ushijima The Loan Shark,Killing Eve
Ushijima The Loan Shark,"Legacies

Technically the first jump the shark moment was when a DUDE MELTED INTO GOO AFTER HAVING SEX! but it somehow got worse after that when they brought in gods who names where Ken, Jen and Ben. 

Like how did we go from names like Klaus Mikaelson and Stefan Salvatore to fucking Ken."
Ushijima The Loan Shark,"I dipped out of walking dead once they found like the 3rd town that had power, gates, a mini running town


And Rick and his gang screwed it all up for them.




Seriously like 3 years after a zombie apocalypse how many towns can be operating"
Ushijima The Loan Shark,The Rookie. They found a criminal who was a doppelganger for one of the officers and had that officer pose as him undercover. When they found the criminals girlfriend she was ALSO a doppelganger for a female officer who has unresolved sexual tension with the first officer. The most unrealistic and fan service-y plot.
Ushijima The Loan Shark,The Handmaid's Tale. Should have ended after season 3 IMO
Ushijima The Loan Shark,Three Pines almost literally did that last episode. There was a random bear who stopped a police chase.
Ushijima The Loan Shark,I don’t know what people are smoking. Fonzie jumping that shark was the best episode.
Ushijima The Loan Shark,Frank Marshall liked to remind people that Happy Days had over 100 episodes *after* Fonzie jumped the shark.
Ushijima The Loan Shark,I still like the show and I'll definitely watch the final season but I'm gonna say The Umbrella Academy.
Ushijima The Loan Shark,I mean Riverdale was never “quality” but the main characters getting superpowers was kind of out of nowhere
Ushijima The Loan Shark,"It wasn't this year, but The Blacklist jumped when they said that Red wasn't really Red."
Ushijima The Loan Shark,"I thought this season of Umbrella Academy was completely underwhelming, will wait for season 4 to determine if it Jumped the Shark.
They set up this epic Sparrow Vs. Umbrella narrative for season 4. The sparrows could have been a little more flushed out IMO, and deserved more screen time."
Ushijima The Loan Shark,The Crown season 5 was underwhelming. Like it came and went without any of the fanfare or discourse we were used to in previous seasons.
Ushijima The Loan Shark,Marvellous Mrs Maisel. It went from delightfully campy to straight cartoonishly dumb.
Ushijima The Loan Shark,"Yellowstone, first 4 seasons were really good.  This new season is almost unwatchable...."
Ushijima The Loan Shark,"Westworld. Spoiler tag for those who want to watch.

>!Season 1 was a masterpiece. Season 2 leans too heavily on the non linear structure of S1 and lacked compelling story. Season 3 was a total design shift. The story was interesting and the future world was fascinating, but it lost its soul a bit. Taking the story into the big bad world, making it about some random human and the plights of humanity was somehow less interesting than self aware robots and their makers. Season 4 just dialed it up to 100 but not in a good way. Full scale world domination plot lines. Human resistances. Robot utopia. Sounds cool but the execution was cheesy and forced. So many wasted or under utilised characters. It had lost that cerebral, analytical, thrilling element that pulled you so far into season 1. By the end it felt like a classic good vs evil, brain vs brawn, good guy vs bad guy trope. The best parts of the previous seasons were when those lines were blurred.!<"

Ushijima The Loan Shark,"Russian Doll.  Loved the first season and while I watched the second season in its entirety, I almost bailed a few times.  The plot wasn't very captivating and something seemed different with Natasha Lyonne's character and/or acting."

Ushijima The Loan Shark,"Hot Ones just did an interview/ad with PussnBoots. It seemed like people in the comments loved it and maybe it wasn’t for me, but I couldn’t help but think it had jumped the shark. I was already feeling like their lineup of guests had begun to fall off. Then this."
Ushijima The Loan Shark,… 25 years ago? Fonz jumped the shark in 1977.
Ushijima The Loan Shark,"Why do people keep saying that jumping the shark is when the show is at it’s peak? It’s not. A well loved show will have peaks and troughs in quality, and so you forgive it when it has a decline in quality.

Jumping the shark is the moment you’re watching an episode and realise that it has slid further than a usual dip in quality, and is likely never to climb back again. You know that future peaks are going to be lower than previous troughs. That it won’t ever be the show you remember and love.

There’s a chance that moment happens at a peak. You can watch supernatural season five and realise that this is the best the show will ever be. But more likely it happens when a small(ish) town thug trying to turn his life around goes waterskiing in California in a leather jacket."
Ushijima The Loan Shark,"Handmaids Tale S5. Good fucking god. Went from excellence to an absolute nightmare. Awful dialogue, acting, pacing, plotting, writing. I cannot stress how lazy and ridiculous the dialogue has gotten. All around shitshow; season 4 was arguably just as bad too but S5 is proof that the show is lost. 

Which is weird because lots of the fans still seem to be vibing with it."
Ushijima The Loan Shark,"Marvelous Mrs Maesel (sp?).  The Ferris Wheel scene was cringe, along with a few others.  Not sure what they're thinking.

Ushijima The Loan Shark,For All Mankind leaned in on the worst characters and doubled down on the worst story beat from Season 2 to continued diminishing returns. Made what felt like it could be a shark jumping moment in S2 absolutely one in light of S3.

Ushijima The Loan Shark,"Criminal minds reboot. Early seasons of the original were mostly singular episodes based on catching one killer. Even arcs where they had a big baddie over multiple episodes felt more “special” and believable. 

The newest episodes have >!a whole network of nationwide serial killers!<, someone who is under arrest gifting Penelope a kitten (at Rossi’s suggestion), and things like senators who are apparently so *all-powerful* that they say they can shut down the entire BAU with a single phone call (??).  

Also a weird side storyline where we’re supposed to believe JJ’s home life is some sort of compelling and domestic marital bliss, with that creepy, dead-eyed husband who should totally be playing a murderer instead."
Ushijima The Loan Shark,"For me it’s Yellowstone. I loved the first few seasons and now it’s just the same old shit over and over and over, with Beth’s character really being the straw that broke the camels back for me. She’s become insufferable and for me, I won’t be finishing this season."

Ushijima The Loan Shark,Big mouth. A show that started great and just kept getting better spent this season doing way too many musical numbers and making all their likeable characters unlikeable.

Overlord,Here’s your daily reminder that Sinclair Broadcasting is a terrible company.
Overlord,"But why..who would think this was a good idea and why? Was their 'good' intentions to just dumb it down? Is it some sort of scare tactic from a study that shows they get more views that way? I wonder if I'm just thinking too much into ot.

Isn't this the same company that made over a dozen stations issue the same creepy statement"
Overlord,Him getting paid is probably an accounting error and they will “fix it” lolz.
Overlord,"Wait are they trying to ""revamp"" weather alerts? WTF? I thought that only the National Weather Service can issue those and not corporate HQ?"
Overlord,I think he explained that very well.
Overlord,"And this is why local TV networks should be owned and operated locally, and not owned by some corporation."
Overlord,"That has to be the calmest ""pissed-off weatherman"" in history.  I thought he explained the situation very well."
Overlord,If you are watching a Sinclair station there's a good chance you're as misinformed as a Fox viewer.
Overlord,Sinclair is dastardly.  They should be destroyed.
Overlord,Thankful for this guy.
Overlord,Corporate entities are constantly trying to make the weather more exciting at the expense of actually informing the public. There's a reason The Weather Channel is the only place that 'names' winter storms.
Overlord,"Joe Crain, The weatherman of the people!"
Overlord,Did he get fired yet?
Overlord,Corporate entities! LISTEN👏TO👏YOUR👏FUCKING👏EMPLOYEES👏
Overlord,"I t may be that the best weather coverage to be Channel 9 KWTV in Oklahoma City. For one thing, there is the OU weather research center close by; for another Okies are just into weather. 

The main guy there will call warnings in real time. He stands in front of a green screen with feeds from multiple storm chasers and a helicopter. 

I really don't know how they pay for it all. 

KWTV is still locally owned."
Overlord,This is nothing compared to what Sinclair Group is trying to pull off.  Pure evil.
Overlord,"ex-weatherman.

I have no doubt that since it was a male weatherman he was fired where as a female would only get a talking to."
Overlord,"And they own over 60% of local news stations in the country, working on more as we speak. And this current administration and Senate sure as hell ain’t gonna stop them"
Overlord,~~This is~~ [They are] extremely dangerous to our democracy.
Overlord,"But Sinclair Cares! 





/s"
Overlord,">But why..who would think this was a good idea and why?

By keeping your viewers in always state of alert and danger, even for a fucking weather you can easily 'control' viewers so to speak. With their hypervigilance they can be easily persuaded on certain thoughts or persuaded to buy certain things."
Overlord,">Is it some sort of scare tactic from a study that shows they get more views that way?  
  
Whatever gets people to sit through commercials.  
That's the only function of television programming."
Overlord,">But why..who would think this was a good idea and why?
  
I made a video that answers you question and it will SHOCK you!"
Overlord,"Reminds me of the now discontinued terror alert system, which I think was invented by Karl Rove. A color-coded warning to the public with no explanation, I always thought it was conceived purely to instill some sense of fear in the public, which maintained trust that the administration was taking care of you while justifying acts of aggression on a non-existent threat. 

What difference did it make to me whether it was green or orange? None, I'm still going to go to the baseball game or get on my flight. There's absolutely nothing I can do to prepare for a terrorist attack somewhere in the vast US states. It worked though, Bush was handily reelected. 

I'm sure some similar tactic is being used leading up to 2020, in this case the terrorists are migrants seeking asylum."
Overlord,"> But why..who would think this was a good idea and why?

Almost every single person I've argued about climate change with has eventually brought up the line ""but the weatherman can't even predict whether there's rain tomorrow, so obviously saying that global warming is going to happen is bullshit"".

Sinclair is driven by a pathological desire to spread conservative bullshit. By having their weathermen unable to predict storms, that further cements the meme that ""experts"" cannot be trusted, and that conservative skeptics should be trusted instead."
Overlord,He was fired a couple days after.
Overlord,why would you think weather alerts can only be issued by the NWS?
Overlord,Yes.
Overlord,Women have it so easy because Men's Rights REEEEEEEE!!! *adjusts fedora*
Overlord,"To be fair, women learn from their mistakes whereas men go on being idiots until the day they die.  If it weren't for male privilege, none of us would have anything to show for ourselves."
Overlord,The administration blocked Sinclair from buying Tribune news stations.
Overlord,And there are apparently people who still don't know this.
Overlord,There are no commercials during severe weather events
Overlord,I never remember the terror alert being below Orange
Overlord,"Heh, I'm subscribed to the State Department's mailing list (mostly for the consular outreach notifications), and they used to send out regular TERRORISM ALERT emails warning me that terrorists might attack anywhere in Europe at any time and that I should remain very afraid and avoid dangerous places like tourist attractions, airports, train stations, shops, hotels, clubs, restaurants, parks, schools, and events. Oddly, those have stopped lately, though; all I get these days are emails warning me about planned demonstrations and marches against climate change or racism or whatever and advising me to avoid the Dublin city centre and to cower in fear at home that day instead."
Overlord,It makes a difference to people in security positions.
Overlord,"> in an interview with the State Journal-Register following his missive, Crain said he was still employed.

Article claims otherwise. You are Fake News."
Overlord," WTF does a corporation gets to set its own weather alerts? Here is the NWS website info:

https://www.weather.gov/about/warnings-issuance-process"
Overlord,[deleted]
Overlord,Ajit Pai had to throw off the scent somehow after he allowed Sinclair to grow to its current size.
Overlord,"Apparently ""code red days"" dont necessarily correspond to actual serious events, but are in fact another way to try and fool people into watching through commercials."
Overlord,"Those people have access to better, more directly relevant information than a color coded news alert system."
Overlord,nothing on that page forbids meteorologists not associated with the NWS from alerting the public of dangers.
Overlord,That's kind of the idea.
Overlord,"Seems kind of odd that a corporation would be issuing their own alert system, in my opinion."
Overlord,"why?  Do you trust the government to be the sole source of truth about dangers in other areas?  Corporations can issue alerts about cyber attacks, for example, and everyone accepts it without waiting for government issuing the warning."
Overlord,"Yes I trust the government, elected by the public, over private enterprises that exist solely to make money which the public has no control over."
Overlord,"> why? Do you trust the government to be the sole source of truth about dangers in other areas? Corporations can issue alerts about cyber attacks, for example, and everyone accepts it without waiting for government issuing the warning.

So you are fine with corporations like Sinclair issuing things like tornado warnings on their own? Like I would trust the NWS more than Sinclair because they issue them fast and without any fluff. Not only that but how would Sinclair know current conditions?"
Overlord,Sinclair is owned by the people that own the current government
Overlord,Get the fuck outta here with your pro-Sinclair bullshit.
Overlord,"got it.  You trust the FCC over Mozilla, and Sarah Huckabee Sanders over the New York Times.

I hate Sinclair, but that doesn't mean they're not allowed to issue weather warnings.  And we're welcome to ignore Sinclair."
Overlord,"I hate Sinclair, but that doesn't mean they're not allowed to issue weather warnings. And we're welcome to ignore Sinclair.

And Sinclair would likely hire meteorologists.  Not every weather station is owned by the government."
Overlord,So you're saying Sinclair issuing warnings is the same as the current government issuing warnings? That seems an odd point to try to make.
Overlord,"got it. You trust the FCC over Mozilla, and Sarah Huckabee Sanders over the New York Times.

I hate Sinclair, but that doesn't mean they're not allowed to issue weather warnings. And we're welcome to ignore Sinclair."
Overlord,Where did he praise Sinclair in that comment
Overlord,"Thanks for those random and useless comparisons.

I'm not in favor of privatizing weather warnings. Sorry."
Overlord,"and that's fine.  but there's nothing illegal about private weather warnings, and it happens all the time.  Which was the original point of my post."
Overlord,It worst with shows acquired from other countries. They cut scenes for commercials. I notice it with Family Law on CW. They cut a scene at the beginning of the show for the 1st episode.
Overlord,"iirc AMC does less frequent but longer breaks


also, yeah, hourlong TV episodes have been 42 minutes for over at least 15 years"
Overlord,20 years ago.
Overlord,Whenever tv viewership went down. There’s a writer/producer on tik tok who worked on some big shows explains a lot of things and he said at some point when the viewership of tv went down advertisers paid less per ad so you had to show more ads to make up for that lost.
Overlord,News programs are the worst. They're ads with brief interludes of news.
Overlord,"You can really see it when watching Network shows on streaming. Watch an episode of Arrow or Flash, and it's 42 minutes long. Stick on an episode of The Next Generation from 1992 and it's 46 minutes long. Episodes of the original Star Trek from 1966 are 50 minutes."
Overlord,"It's typically 45 minutes in an hour long show. In more recent years, the length of an episode has been more lax than previously, so you might have just caught a shorter episode.

The real takeaway here is that if you watch TV regularly, ads are wasting a few years of your life. Cable should be free when you calculate the opportunity cost of that x 3 (24 hours in a day, not 8) x your salary."
Overlord,"I first noticed back when ABC had Less Than Perfect on that sitcoms were getting shorter. Less Than Perfect had episodes around 19 minutes. Mom, on CBS, had episodes shorter. Some of Mom's episodes run at barely 18 minutes. I wonder how this works for syndication. When old sitcoms from the 50's to the 80's (which usually had lengths of 24 to 25 minutes) reran on N@N, they had about 3 to 4 minutes cut out for commercials. I can't imagine shows today getting that much cut out for commercials in syndication. Episodes wouldn't make any sense."
Overlord,I've been watching rereuns of X-Files and other shows on Comet TV and noticed they're edited in a way that the commercial break isn't where it was in the original broadcast. It will be the middle of the scene and they'll just cut to commercial at the end of someone's sentence.
Overlord,40% of the 2021 Indy 500 was spent in commercial breaks.
Overlord,"People watching less TV, and there's more channels which means less people watching each channel. Gotta find someway to maintain revenue, and having more/longer commercials is the easiest way."
Overlord,The hour long episode has always been like 40 minutes
Overlord,"After watching nothing but streaming for several years, I tried to watch a show on live basic cable and it was jarring. I couldn’t get through it. The show would set a deep, serious tone, and just as you got into the vibe, the Charmin bears would dance onto the screen. I ended up paying for AMC+ to watch Season 6 of BCS comercial-free, and then canceled it when it was over."
Overlord,"The only time I am forced to watch commercials are the streaming Colbert Site
Stream and/or download the shows, there are no commecials they have been cut to save file size"
Overlord,"CONSUME.
CONSUME THE PRODUCTS.
CONSUME THE ENVIRONMENT.
CONSUME UNTIL THE RIVERS ARE DRY AND THE OCEANS ARE BARREN AND MICROPLASTICS OUTWEIGH BIOMASS AND CLEAN WATER AND FRESH AIR CAN FINALLY BE COMMODITIZED.

consume fancy feast today!"
Overlord,"Probably you’re just angry. Those timings are off

Cable nets generally get 12-17 minutes per hour of commercials. Usually it’s around 15 then you have some bumpers and such. And rarely do commercial blocks go over 3-4 minutes. 

22-23 minutes of content for a 30 minute show and 44-46 for an hour long. 

Sports is the one that gets wacky, just due to its live nature."
Overlord,"I noticed similar stuff watching King of the Hill and Bob's Burgers in syndication. There's a lot of small interactions that are cut out all over, it kinda throws me off with shows like that that I know really well.

In one instance an entire opening scene was cut out in a Bob's Burgers episode."
Overlord,"PBS, a non-commercial network, uses edited versions of British shows that cut around 8-10 minutes of content instead of just airing the 58 minute shows.

Explain that."
Overlord,"whelp, guess it's basically just going to ensure I never use cable myself for as long as I live... If people wonder WHY everyone is cutting the cord I think that speaks for itself lol."
Overlord,"yep, math checks out XD"
Overlord,What’s the username?
Overlord,"It’s basically 42. Most networks aren’t lax, it’s outlined to the second for most deliverables and you have to get permission to deviate. (source: I make tv)"
Overlord,"> The real takeaway here is that if you watch TV regularly, ads are wasting a few years of your life. Cable should be free when you calculate the opportunity cost of that x 3 (24 hours in a day, not 8) x your salary.


This is the real kicker - I can't imagine how much time people that actually watch TV on the regular spend watching ads. The funny thing is I probably wouldn't have noticed as quickly but I was hitting the +30s button repeatedly and being confused that I hadn't missed the start of the show after hitting it 7-8 times lol."
Overlord,">The real takeaway here is that if you watch TV regularly, ads are wasting a few years of your life.

My parents used to watch The Big Bang Theory together. My dad unintentionally stopped when mom died. I decided to sit down and watch it with him this year. 

279 ""half-hour"" episodes = 8370 minutes = 139.5 hours = 5 days, 19.5 hours

279 episodes of Big Bang = 3 days, 22 hours

Two whole days of my life this year not spent watching ads."
Overlord,"That's assuming you sit there and watch every single commercial. I'm usually either going to the bathroom, doing an exercise/stretch break, or on my phone during the breaks."
Overlord,is nothing sacred?? have they no decency?!?
Overlord,"Hourlong shows in the 50s and 60s were roughly 50 minutes with 10 minutes of commercials. They were cut down to 48 in the 70s. Then 46, then 44, then they landed at the current 40-42 somewhere in the last decade."
Overlord,"""Always."" 

It's been like 20 years, but definitely not always."
Overlord,"haha I mean yeah back when an ""hour"" was really 50-55 minutes - the DVR for the current ep I have here is 1h9m, meaning they've added ~15m+ of commercials."
Overlord,LOL oh man haven't seen that one happen yet but that's even worse - basically making ANY TV watching into an ad. Good god advertising people are the worst.
Overlord,"I, for one, welcome our robot overlords."
Overlord,"lol my math is off because I'm angry? that's.... not how it works.

> 44-46 for an hour long

well the recording is 1h9m, so that would be about 25m of commercials assuming it's an average of 45m. I was watching eps 3-6 at the time, so looking at the wiki the episode lengths are 46, 44, 50, and 44 the the bare minimum there is ~20m of ad time (assuming that 50m ep recording wasn't actually 1h15m or more)."
Overlord,"Don’t know about PBS - I don’t watch the channel. 

All I know is that CW cut scenes from it acquired programming for commercial breaks."
Overlord,"And they have the gall to do pledge specials every 3 months lasting for a month consisting of health infomercials disgusted as lectures, so they can keep broadcasting edited versions."
Overlord,Not so. PBS even re-edited Downton Abbey to turn the 50-minute originals into 58 minute episodes.
Overlord,i mean you can literally just set up a PVR and fast forward through ads - and some of the popular programs have things that auto-detect ads and fast forward through them
Overlord,michaeljaminwriter
Overlord,"It's around 3.125 years if you watch a four hours of tv a day. That's a ton of wasted productivity x 330 million people. At the average American income, that's around $832,000 for a lifetime of tv watching. No way your bill is coming to that for a lifetime of watching cable. That shit should be free. What you pay for streaming is a damn blessing."
Overlord,There it is. Sorry about your mom.
Overlord,"BBT was keeping CBS afloat so they filled it with adverts. A couple of episodes ended up being 15 minutes. 

They’re doing it again with their current hit, the US remake of Ghosts. This week’s episode was 20 minutes."
Overlord,"AMC does some funky stuff when they have these off-timing shows occasionally. Really, they're the only channel that does, they may be doing the thing where they push more ads right at the beginning of the hour (as the show extended a few minutes into the next hour), which is why they are extending the length slightly. It allows them to push more ad viewership for nielsen into a 5th quarter hour time slot.

This is highly unusual though, so they are kinda one-off weird exceptions.

Generally the most you'd see is 18 minutes in an hour, but even this is rare, 16 is more common for max ad time per hour, and its usually fairly spaced out evenly, give or take

1h9m would realistically be a about 22 minutes, at most of commercial time, that is if they do some awkward stuff with the extra 9 minutes, and go full steam on ads during the first hour

Just more explaining how it actually works for commercial blocks during airings"
Overlord,"haha I mean others can but I don't have cable myself, was just watching the recordings online so there are buttons to skip 30s ahead but they seem to break repeatedly."
Overlord,Maybe the 0.1% would be a more accurate description of Murdoch.

Bungo Stray Dogs,"Great write up!


I'm not familiar with most of these, and I watch a shit-ton of TV and movies. I really like the effort, and the writeups are perfect in length.


Again, not knowing these a lot, is Severance the highest ranked English speaking show? (Nothing against non English speakers of course) 


Also, I'm guessing most of these are straight drama? Language and genre might both be useful things to put in parenthesis for anyone else unfamiliar.


Totally agree with the couple from White Lotus being great characters, I much preferred season 1 (which seems like a hot take) but those two, specifically the woman, were very interesting characters to me."

Bungo Stray Dogs,"This is Going to Hurt: I'm a medical student and I thought I'd seen every medical show but this one is on my list now! I've heard that this show shows the reality of a doctor's life without all the glamor of medicine.  
  
This show compared to other medical shows what do you think and what other medical shows have you watched I'm curious!"
Bungo Stray Dogs,"Insanely odd for the 2 anime to show up to be an average romcom (with crazy production value) and a good but lesser known sequel.

(Oh NVM I thought this was a list from some website not yours! Still surprised to see MDUD though!)"
Bungo Stray Dogs,"What did Frank Ocean say that one time? ""I got two versions. I got twooo versions…""

..................

I didn't like what 2022 television had to offer for the most part. One too many disappointments for me as well. I mean I watched a lot more shows than I did in 2021, yet struggled to find 25 new shows for this list. But I do think my top 13 here are genuinely great.But anyways, thanks a lot for reading, even if you just scrolled through this lol. Same time, same place, next year? ❤️"
Bungo Stray Dogs,"Neat list.  A lot of shows I've not seen.

A few shows from 2022 I'd recommend if you haven't seen em:

- Black Bird

- SAS Rogue Heroes

- The Offer

- Under the Banner of Heaven"
Bungo Stray Dogs,Recency bias but I just finished Yellowjackets and really had a great time watching it.
Bungo Stray Dogs,No Atlanta? Both seasons last year were incredible
Bungo Stray Dogs,Pachinko is the most slept on series of 2022
Bungo Stray Dogs,"1. She hulk
2. Ted lasso
3. Ms Marvel
4. Harley Quinn show
5. Lord of the rings
6. Spy x family 
7. Chainsaw man
8. Loki
9. Mob psycho
10. Hot D"
Bungo Stray Dogs,Which ones did you see? 🤔 amma take a wild guess and say The Bear and Severance?
Bungo Stray Dogs,"> is Severance the highest ranked English speaking show?

Yes. Even though Pachinko got a bit of english too. 

> I'm guessing most of these are straight drama? Language and genre might both be useful things to put in parenthesis for anyone else unfamiliar.

Yea. And yea I should probably do that next time."
Bungo Stray Dogs,"i just read the synopsis and glance at the preview a bit sometimes just to check visual/production quality. if it looks like something that could be potentially great, i check it out."
Bungo Stray Dogs,🙂💕
Bungo Stray Dogs,It’s great but it’s depressing.
Bungo Stray Dogs,"What other new anime from 2022 did you think were great? 

Anime for me in 2022 was, *meh* tbh. I didn't like Summertime Rendering much and Chainsaw Man hasn't gotten to the good parts of the manga yet. I was suppose to see Bocchi The Rock! before making this list, but ended up getting an ear infection so couldn't."
Bungo Stray Dogs,I'd count Yellowjackets as 2021 TV show.
Bungo Stray Dogs,on the other version of this list pinned on my profile.
Bungo Stray Dogs,"Nice! Do you often give the pilot a go before fully committed to the whole season? Any shows that you have given up midpoint? 


Like I tried to start Warrior Nun because the trailer seems fun and the lead actress looks very beautiful, also being afraid of it being cancelled (it indeed got cancelled then), but have given up after episode 6 or 7… cause the plot is very weak and the characters are laughable.


And then I tried to pick the ones that got high ratings in imdb, and started watching Extraordinary Attorney Woo and I do like it so far! Although sometimes being too cheesy at times, the acting is excellent and the stories are well-written. Highly recommended."
Bungo Stray Dogs,"Dropped Summertime after 5 minutes lol.

But personally, Bocchi the Rock is incredible TV and is my #1 show of any medium this year. And I'm not even usually into anime comedies. It's just that good, glad you're gonna try it! I'm an Attack on Titan fan after the massive story shift in Season 3, and S4P2 aired at the start of the year, although personally I don't like rating something that isn't an entire season.

Otherwise Chainsaw Man would be a decent pick even if, as you said, it hasn't quite gotten to what makes it special yet. Cyberpunk Edgerunners is one that would be worth watching and has near universal praise, and my other 2 shows to hit a 9 were Kaguya S3 (but it's not everyone), and Paripi Koumei, which I thought was an extremely passionate show but it might hit as a 7-8 for others. 

From your list I probably have to watch the 2 seasons of Tatami though. I had no idea it was well regarded I never looked into it!

Other than that though, yea there was a lot of meh. Spy Family went from potentially great to just average as it went on, LycoRyco got a lot of hype but was merely good not great (needed some writing cleanup). Personally though Dress up Darling was ok at best, and Gundam and To Your Eternity were massive disappointments"
Bungo Stray Dogs,Ignoring some great sequels I thought Chainsaw man was awesome even if it hadn't gotten to some of the good parts  of the manga. And I really liked summertime rendering (although I haven't seen the last few episodes). Lycoris recoil was fun. Spy X Family was great.
Bungo Stray Dogs,Oh my bad. I’m late to the party.
Bungo Stray Dogs,"> Do you often give the pilot a go before fully committed to the whole season?

I give everything at least 4 episodes before I decided whether it's working for me or not. Unless it's *reeeeeeeaaaaally* bad... then I quit after the 2nd or 3rd. But that rarely happens. That has only happened like 4 times in the past 3 years. 

> Any shows that you have given up midpoint?

A shit ton. 

> Extraordinary Attorney

I was suppose to watch this show too but unfortunately didn't have time for it. There are some great shows coming out of korea nowadays (3 are on this list too lol), but they require commitment with those lengthy episode counts and runtime. 

I recommend ""**D.P.**"" on netflix too if you haven't seen it. That's another outstanding one."
Bungo Stray Dogs,"> Bocchi the Rock is incredible TV and is my #1 show of any medium this year. And I'm not even usually into anime comedies. It's just that good

damn. guess i gotta hurry and check this one out now. lol."
Bungo Stray Dogs,"You should check out Kotaro Lives Alone, such a good show!"
Bungo Stray Dogs,"Heard good reviews about DP but I haven’t managed to watch it, with season 2 coming this year I may watch it soon!

For other Korean shows I watched My Name, Hellbound and of course Squid Game in 2021, which were all very good. Narco-Saints, The Glory and Somebody are shows I saved in 2022 but not started yet."
Bungo Stray Dogs,I did hear about it! I'll add it to my list thanks!
Bungo Stray Dogs,">What made me mad in the last show was in the middle of the game they has this really intense sequens of someone setting the table. 

The point was that Al got himself thrown out of the game intentionally so he could meet with one of the owners of the team and save his job. It was supposed to be a very tense moment for everyone, and also to show that Al is actually really smart and can play politics. "
Bungo Stray Dogs,I understand what the scene was about.  It just made me mad that they seemed to put more effort into directing that than the baseball scenes.
KonoSuba: Gods Blessing on This Wonderful World,When I said I wanted him to revisit Troy this wasn't what I had in mind
KonoSuba: Gods Blessing on This Wonderful World,So uh...I see development on the Community movie is going smoothly.
KonoSuba: Gods Blessing on This Wonderful World,This title reads like an ad-lib.
KonoSuba: Gods Blessing on This Wonderful World,"Can’t wait for everyone to be snarky, disaffected and full of deeply rooted personality disorders"
KonoSuba: Gods Blessing on This Wonderful World,"Hey, Hercules what's up, want to go do some quick tasks with your uncle? 5 minutes tops, we'll be in and out."
KonoSuba: Gods Blessing on This Wonderful World,The comment about it being broadcast on Tubi the next day makes me wonder if Hulu will no longer have new Fox episodes the day after they premiere.
KonoSuba: Gods Blessing on This Wonderful World,Just gonna predict a season 4 meltdown of some kind right now.
KonoSuba: Gods Blessing on This Wonderful World,\#SixSeasonsAndaMovie
KonoSuba: Gods Blessing on This Wonderful World,Classical Greece seems like a no-brainer setting for a guy whose entire body of work are variations on explorations of fatherhood.
KonoSuba: Gods Blessing on This Wonderful World,"I'm willing to give this a shot. Love Dan Harmon.

Anyone know how the production of other shows affects Rick and Marty? Solar Opposites didn't seem to take any energy away from season 4, I wonder if Harmon will have to give up time on R&M for this."
KonoSuba: Gods Blessing on This Wonderful World,I just want Dan Harmon to work on himself.
KonoSuba: Gods Blessing on This Wonderful World,Why is it always a family? Every cartoon is a family.
KonoSuba: Gods Blessing on This Wonderful World,[deleted]
KonoSuba: Gods Blessing on This Wonderful World,"I hope it has a new animation style. This chinless, stilted, super flat Bob’s Burgers/Rick and Morty style is so played out and dull."
KonoSuba: Gods Blessing on This Wonderful World,You had me at Dan Harmon. Solely because of community. The fact that he also does Rick and Morty is just a bonus feature of Harmon. From Community alone he has earned my eternal viewership.
KonoSuba: Gods Blessing on This Wonderful World,So Justin Roiland is gonna voice like half the cast with the two voices he can do
KonoSuba: Gods Blessing on This Wonderful World,So is it basically disney owns all the old fox shows but wont own any of the new ones? I think?
KonoSuba: Gods Blessing on This Wonderful World,[What doesn't Fox greenlight?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oMTmtN7lHI)
KonoSuba: Gods Blessing on This Wonderful World,"Boy, has it become edgy to shit on R & M. LoL"
KonoSuba: Gods Blessing on This Wonderful World,"I think this should be shopped to FX, Adult Swim or a streaming platform. I can’t picture this on FOX after the Simpsons and before Family Guy because after a while the network executives will hate this show and demand Harmon make changes before not scheduling episodes or burying it in the 7:30/6:30 pm Sunday night time slot before canceling it, just like Futurama."
KonoSuba: Gods Blessing on This Wonderful World,"Given how enjoyable Harmonquest was, I have high hopes."
KonoSuba: Gods Blessing on This Wonderful World,The future for Fox animation is somewhat bright but at the same time it’s not cause Duncanville and Bless the Harts are unlikely to get s3. Makes me kinda sad.
KonoSuba: Gods Blessing on This Wonderful World,alright
KonoSuba: Gods Blessing on This Wonderful World,Have them play through “Hades”
KonoSuba: Gods Blessing on This Wonderful World,Sounds cool. Can't wait for fans to ruin it.
KonoSuba: Gods Blessing on This Wonderful World,Season one will be in 2025.  Season two will be in 2077.
KonoSuba: Gods Blessing on This Wonderful World,So once again fuck Rick and Morty or what?
KonoSuba: Gods Blessing on This Wonderful World,"How surprising to see the top comments being cynical snarky vaguely angry stuff.

That's not what one would expect."
KonoSuba: Gods Blessing on This Wonderful World,This will only encourage the gen z kids who think Hades is an UwU Daddy Deity
KonoSuba: Gods Blessing on This Wonderful World,"Sweet, anything by Dan Harmon I’m down for"
KonoSuba: Gods Blessing on This Wonderful World,"At the pace these two work, I look forward to the first season in 2027"
KonoSuba: Gods Blessing on This Wonderful World,What happened to ten seasons of rick and morty lol
KonoSuba: Gods Blessing on This Wonderful World,Like he needs another show to not finish on time
KonoSuba: Gods Blessing on This Wonderful World,"I can’t wait to watch one season of this, wait three years for the second season, and then see it get canceled."
KonoSuba: Gods Blessing on This Wonderful World,Finish Rick and morty first you dick!
KonoSuba: Gods Blessing on This Wonderful World,Dan Harmon needs to start taking his ADHD meds and focus on one series at a time; he ends up screwing over some truly great media by jumping ship creatively.
KonoSuba: Gods Blessing on This Wonderful World,"I’m kinda tired with Dan Harmons writing style after watching R+M and Community. Let’s hope the main character isn’t another super-snarky, charming, narcissist, with ‘commitment issues’."
KonoSuba: Gods Blessing on This Wonderful World,Animation's biggest narcissist sells a show in which Narcissus will likely be a character. That's some real Harmon-esque meta-humor.
KonoSuba: Gods Blessing on This Wonderful World,Yo sysiphus can you push this boulder up to the top of this hill for me? Quick 20 minute adventure
KonoSuba: Gods Blessing on This Wonderful World,"On the one hand im excited, on the other hand if its a nihilistic series like rick and mory i’d be sad. (Rick and morty is objectively a very good show, i just cant stand its harshness)."
KonoSuba: Gods Blessing on This Wonderful World,Really wish Hollywood would stop letting dudes like Dan Harmon and Joss Whedon make shows :/ can’t wait for Dan Harmon to stick a sexy woman in the show with complex emotions and call himself a feminist or some bs like that
KonoSuba: Gods Blessing on This Wonderful World,"I'll probably check it out, but honestly I don't really think Dan Harmon is that great."
KonoSuba: Gods Blessing on This Wonderful World,"Sidebet on ""it's time to kick some serious Athens"" joke"
KonoSuba: Gods Blessing on This Wonderful World,"Or, you know, he could work on the shit he already has."
KonoSuba: Gods Blessing on This Wonderful World,"DÆDALUS!!! 

r/Harmontown deep cut cause this is gonna be awesome.

Edit: To find the Greeky ""ae"" thing."
KonoSuba: Gods Blessing on This Wonderful World,There better be a lot of gay shit.
KonoSuba: Gods Blessing on This Wonderful World,God there are some snarky pendantic fucks commenting in this thread
KonoSuba: Gods Blessing on This Wonderful World,Im Pickle-Styx!
KonoSuba: Gods Blessing on This Wonderful World,"If it's anything like Rick and Morty, I'll pass."
KonoSuba: Gods Blessing on This Wonderful World,What a fantastic time for animation!
KonoSuba: Gods Blessing on This Wonderful World,So another Blood of Zeus?
KonoSuba: Gods Blessing on This Wonderful World,Dan Harmon is the new Seth McFarlane?
KonoSuba: Gods Blessing on This Wonderful World,Wonder if it will put out eps faster than Rick and Morty. Dan Harmon's is the kirkman of cartoons. Comic fans will get what I mean...
KonoSuba: Gods Blessing on This Wonderful World,"I’ve grown up in the PJ generation that loves greek mythology, but you gotta admit that it shows up a lot in pop culture compared to other mythological systems. We should let the others shine."
KonoSuba: Gods Blessing on This Wonderful World,Great news. Maybe we can see it in 4 years
KonoSuba: Gods Blessing on This Wonderful World,Dan Harmon gets your hopes up then bails everytime. Just like my dad.
KonoSuba: Gods Blessing on This Wonderful World,Please don’t be ugly. Pleaaasse don’t be ugly. Please. Pleasse.
KonoSuba: Gods Blessing on This Wonderful World,... and it’s canceled.
KonoSuba: Gods Blessing on This Wonderful World,Sounds entertaining
KonoSuba: Gods Blessing on This Wonderful World,#SixSeasonsAndAMovie!
KonoSuba: Gods Blessing on This Wonderful World,Sounds like an even shittier Disenchantment tbh
KonoSuba: Gods Blessing on This Wonderful World,I see dan harmon i excite
KonoSuba: Gods Blessing on This Wonderful World,"Excited about Harmon show very very much!

Not very excited about Ancient Greece - tired of Disney's Hercules or God of War-like retellings, want to see more straight adaptation done well. But ok"
KonoSuba: Gods Blessing on This Wonderful World,So we get another half finished project he dumps after 4 seasons? I love his work but the drama behind the scenes ruins a lot of his projects
KonoSuba: Gods Blessing on This Wonderful World,Well that sounds like a terrible premise.
KonoSuba: Gods Blessing on This Wonderful World,Hard pass
KonoSuba: Gods Blessing on This Wonderful World,"Great, so he can give us the best shit ever for 2-3 seasons, then have another episode and either leave or run it into the ground.... Like I'm a full supporter and believer in being understanding about mental health, i just don't know if I can get invested in another thing he's done because it always ends the same way."
KonoSuba: Gods Blessing on This Wonderful World,Well guess it seems Harmon made it out of that wierd raping a baby doll controversy I see lol
KonoSuba: Gods Blessing on This Wonderful World,Depressed comedy writer here. I'm so desperate I'll work for Dan Harmon! I have years of experience taking abuse. Dan??
KonoSuba: Gods Blessing on This Wonderful World,"Futurama :: Disenchanted //
Rick and Morty :: this
?

Sounds fun! Hope they don't let the thru line crowd out all the jokes 😬"
KonoSuba: Gods Blessing on This Wonderful World,[deleted]
KonoSuba: Gods Blessing on This Wonderful World,I love rick and morty it’s awesome but anytime it says Fox it’s gonna suck. I’ll give it a chance but I feel like it will be limited.
KonoSuba: Gods Blessing on This Wonderful World,Yawn.
KonoSuba: Gods Blessing on This Wonderful World,Sounds like an incel wet dream come to life.
KonoSuba: Gods Blessing on This Wonderful World,"Oh boy, I can’t wait for the constant burping, and fart jokes"
KonoSuba: Gods Blessing on This Wonderful World,"Don't tell the Rick and Morty fandom, maybe we can keep this fandom much more clean like Community's.  (For the record I love both shows, but good lord is the fandom for R&M obnoxious and annoying)"
KonoSuba: Gods Blessing on This Wonderful World,"I see Dan harmon, I watch"
KonoSuba: Gods Blessing on This Wonderful World,"Wait, isn’t Rick and Morty struggling to release on time?  Why is he starting a new project?"
KonoSuba: Gods Blessing on This Wonderful World,"Can we just get a steady flow of Rick and Morty episodes? The other animated show isn't all that great, I don't expect this one to be either. Is he trying to be Seth McFarlane"
KonoSuba: Gods Blessing on This Wonderful World,I can only hope it does suckass like most FOX animated shows.
KonoSuba: Gods Blessing on This Wonderful World,Bro. Get that new season of Rick and Morty out. Fuck man! This asshole said he had already finished writing it last year.
KonoSuba: Gods Blessing on This Wonderful World,Sounds stupid. but i'll wait and see. I'd rather just see more Rick and Morty
KonoSuba: Gods Blessing on This Wonderful World,"Besides settings his characters and shows fundamentally are all the same. That doesn't make them bad but it does make episode to episode watching somewhat repetitive. Maybe two episodes of solar opposites didn't feel like it was taking place somewhere Rick and morty were.

Edit: I get everyone's point and I think it just emphasizes that these two basically have one mode"
KonoSuba: Gods Blessing on This Wonderful World,"I’m sure this will be amazing at first... but like every other project of Dan Harmon’s, it’ll taper off and then suck until it’s cancelled. 

I feel like he’s great at starting projects, but really bad at long term commitments."
KonoSuba: Gods Blessing on This Wonderful World,"Harmon and Roiland: Hey we know that R&M takes forever to put out episodes, but let's each make entire other shows while we're at it."
KonoSuba: Gods Blessing on This Wonderful World,Not an interesting plot
KonoSuba: Gods Blessing on This Wonderful World,"Honestly, the Rick and Morty guys are both stretching themselves way too thin by taking on so many projects, and it shows. Each new season of Rick and Morty is worse than the last now, and I don’t find any of their new stuff to be all that good either. There’s a good reason why greats like Groening, Trey and Parker, and Judge keep their main focus on one or two projects at a time.

Downvote me all you want, dorks, but the last season of Rick and Morty was complete trash, and their other new shows are even worse. They aren’t talented enough to do so much at once. Nobody is."
KonoSuba: Gods Blessing on This Wonderful World,"Honestly Harmon produces good shit, I can't wait"
KonoSuba: Gods Blessing on This Wonderful World,"You son of a bitch, I'm in. I am fucking in.

I love Greek Mythology. I love Community. I love Rick and Morty."
KonoSuba: Gods Blessing on This Wonderful World,"Colour me unenthused. I was never in love with Harmon’s brand of humour, but I’m especially burned out creators drawing on the “Greek mythology” well of inspiration."
KonoSuba: Gods Blessing on This Wonderful World,How about finishing rick and Morty mfer
KonoSuba: Gods Blessing on This Wonderful World,“Ancient Greece” “one of the world’s first cities” 🙄🙄🙄
KonoSuba: Gods Blessing on This Wonderful World,"Man, Dan Harmon can bite my shiny metal ass. Forever he talked about doing R&M full time and he is finally finished with his other commitments and signs on to do something else as we wait for more episodes. Honestly I think he is funny to a point but I’m not going to wait forever in fact not going to wait any longer. Auf Wiedersehen her Harmon. I miss you in community now it seems like they were right about you."
KonoSuba: Gods Blessing on This Wonderful World,"Rick and morty will make a special appearance in this, I guarantee."
KonoSuba: Gods Blessing on This Wonderful World,Shut up and take my money
KonoSuba: Gods Blessing on This Wonderful World,I love you Dan Harmon!!! Everything you do is awesome!!!
KonoSuba: Gods Blessing on This Wonderful World,Rick and Morty got hard so he’s just gonna keep making shitty knock offs
KonoSuba: Gods Blessing on This Wonderful World,I bet you a bottom dollar this is going to be more like family guy than Rick and Morty
KonoSuba: Gods Blessing on This Wonderful World,I thought that guy with glasses was Jared from Subway for a minute.
KonoSuba: Gods Blessing on This Wonderful World,This sounds great.
Supergirl,...The Flash is still going on? I could’ve sworn it finished.
Supergirl,A final season full of crossovers? I'll take it. RIP Arrowverse :(
Supergirl,I’ll say it every time. The Flash was on life support with me right until Barry became father to the fundamental forces of the universe or whatever. I think later that season they had flash lightning lightsaber battles.
Supergirl,Can they stick the Iris character in a fridge again?
Supergirl,I wonder if they'll go back in time this season.
Supergirl,"This show hasn't been cancelled yet? My god... how much money are they getting from the BC government for production? It has to be basically free to produce at this point, right?"
Supergirl,she's not terrible. a better actor than Candace anyhow.
Supergirl,The flash has been dead since season 3
Supergirl,It'll be the show's final season (and basically end the whole CW universe).
Supergirl,Never underestimate a networks power to milk a show for as long as they can
Supergirl,"I literally felt insulted when they had Barry step along lightning bolts, like they were steps to reach a certain hight. They actually pretended that lightning was somehow matter and could be used as such. Nevermind how they could have had him run up a building or make a half assed slingshot or even just have supergirl just fucking yeet his ass but no.... They went with fucking lightning steps."
Supergirl,You’ll be surprised how many people tune in to shows on autopilot just because they’ve formed a habit.
Supergirl,"> and basically end the whole CW universe

and our pain."
Supergirl,I need to watch something while on the exercise bike so this works
Supergirl,I think you'd be surprised. I really do.
Supergirl,"I was on the arrowverse train since s2 of arrow. I had to see it through to the end (except Batwoman, I bounced off that quick).

Yes I will watch 9 seasons of a show that has only had brief flashes of it's former glory since s2 or 3"
Supergirl,Bat women is stupid same with S&L it's really dry
Supergirl,"I like Superman and Lois a lot, with the first season being particularly excellent. Part of its appeal may have been it being so separate from any other arrowverse stuff"
Supergirl,I never loved the show but her casting was spot on.
Supergirl,"I worked on that show for a year. I got to know her by face only, but every single time we passed each other by on set, she said hello and asked how i was. Im just a bottom rung nobody at work and it wouldnt have been wrong for her to just ignore me, but she was sweet as pie. Nice lady."
Supergirl,"good casting, terrible fucking show with awful writing and awful effects"
Supergirl,"Hope she gets good roles after this, she's so likeable"
Supergirl,"Melissa Benoist is charming as hell and a joy to watch but goddamn this show does not get called out enough for its total misunderstanding of its central character. It’s like someone looked at the cover of a comic and went oh so she’s just a female Superman let’s just give her all his character traits, origin story, and personality and call it a day."
Supergirl,I think she can easily find herself some good television show or Hollywood movies. She is pretty and imo good/decent actress. I will try to follow her work
Supergirl,"She was enjoyable, the show was not"
Supergirl,"She is so likable, she’s going to make a great villain."
Supergirl,"I love when success happens to good people. I was in a play with Melissa in high school. She was obviously the lead in every play. I was the mailman in Rebel Without a Cause—a role which, you’ll note, does not actually exist."
Supergirl,"Damn, I dropped arrow verse after like season 3 of flash after arrow was going down the drain"
Supergirl,She's a good actor and I'd love to see her in more!
Supergirl,"I remembered when she joined Glee, she was great. So hot too."
Supergirl,"In hindsight was it really necessary or smart to do the whole matriachal society thing? It just feels needless, normalise female protagonists rather than making it a spectacle just because it exists."
Supergirl,"CW has consistently ruined all the shows I’ve ever been interested in on their network, especially Arrow. I guess Supernatural is the diamond in the rough, but even that kinda fell, especially after season 4/5."
Supergirl,"The problem with Supergirl is that they made her ""Girl Superman"" Instead of making her the strong woman of the comics, they made her story more about her relationships with boys instead of a badass alien girl trying to learn to fit in with humans.   Kara Zor-el was a hardcore badass in the comics, but they made her an insecure girl who just wanted a boy to love her."
Supergirl,"The show is something that I have mixed - but largely positive - feelings on.

&#x200B;

**Melissa Benoist**, however, is a ***gem*** and should be cast in **everything** now that her schedule is opening up."
Supergirl,"WB/CW shows are pretty predictable 

if they're good, they have really captivating 1st seasons and then a rapid decline afterward. 

i'm still not sure about her as an actress. I think she would be best in supporting roles in indie projects."
Supergirl,"She was very fine Supergirl. The writers just failed and giving her bad guys, how is it one of the most physically powerful beings in the universe somehow every week find someone who's stronger than she is?"
Supergirl,End of an error
Supergirl,Wait one of these CW superhero shows actually... ended?
Supergirl,"As bad as S5&6 have been, I’m gonna miss this show. I hope the last half of S6 can be as good as 1-4 because those were pretty good (for a CW show)."
Supergirl,The one and only time I ever tried to watch this was the episode  where the big issue was who she was going to date at work.  It was a really bad experience and had more in common with the britney spears movie then a comic book. I couldn't give it another chance after that.
Supergirl,"Pretty much every single actor from this show are good actors and very likeable so I hope they can all continue to get solid roles and really hope a few of them get some bigger roles to show off their abilities. 

Also dissapointed there isnt going to be another musical crossover in the arrowverse."
Supergirl,"Good, I gave up on CW when I noticed all the social justice BS and politics creeping into the episodes"
Supergirl,"Her visuals are next level. I agree with the comments, they could have had much better writing."
Supergirl,And everyone will forget it ever happened.  Even Superman & Lois pretends it doesn't exist
Supergirl,She was fantastic as Supergirl but that show was terrible.
Supergirl,"I hope she gets into some other projects, she was one of my favorites on Glee because of her incredibly rich, underrated voice"
Supergirl,She was the best Supergirl yet. It’s a shame this show wasn’t on a better network with better writers.
Supergirl,This is one of those series that could have hugely benefitted by cutting the seasons in half and spending that budget better for half the season length. Melissa was a great casting tbh. Seasons 1-3 are very good IMO.
Supergirl,"I always wondered this. Is it ""beh-no-ist"" or ""bih-noist"" like moist? I don't know how to pronounce it."
Supergirl,That woman (and the character for that matter)  deserved so much better than what the CW gave her to work with. Then I can say that about most of Arrowverse leads. It legit infuriates me that those CW writers have jobs.
Supergirl,This is still on TV? I caught one episode eons ago and it was cringeworthy to say the least.
Supergirl,"Supergirl pushed a PC agenda way too hard nothing subtle about it, was a huge turnoff for me. Which I get comics have always done but that one seemed like 60% of the shows plot"
Supergirl,The CW shows always seemed like they were supposed to be on MTV in 2013 not on the CW now. It always felt like “Teen Wolf” to me
Supergirl,"The shown was soooo hit or miss for me. It's not suprising that it has finished. I will say though, the cast was probably the best thing about the show and I hope they all go on to better things.

Ps. It's a shame that such a good Lex Luthor got wasted on this show."
Supergirl,Final season.... Should have happened a lot sooner
Supergirl,"Show had early potential but when it moved filming locations writing went to shit.



I quit watching when they started forcing love interests on her. 



Went from strong women doing shit to the cliche women need a man to fuck"
Supergirl,"First rule of CW shows:

Majority of the time they’re fucking awful and corners are being cut"
Supergirl,Goodbye to one of the few shows with a trans actor playing a trans character. Arrowverse went downhill over the years but at least the characters in this one were mostly likable.
Supergirl,"Melissa is an amazing talent.

Hope to see more of her in the future.

Maybe she could play a DC movie villain."
Supergirl,They took what could have been a great show and ruined it
Supergirl,Didn’t know this was still on.
Supergirl,Thank God. The show is unwatchable at this point.
Supergirl,It was great for a season and a half after that it was pure garbage
Supergirl,Oh yes the love or racist show
Supergirl,People actually watched this show..?
Supergirl,Is *The Flash* still on?
Supergirl,"Thank goodness, that show sucked lol"
Supergirl,Finally
Supergirl,"Oh thank god it's over.

I tried watching it, but the show just seems horrible in most aspects and politically preachy to an extent that just seems obnoxious. I don't usually say this, but this show was definitely woke.

Melissa was an alright supergirl tho. She wasn't amazing, but better than most other aspects of the show."
Supergirl,Thank God
Supergirl,"If Mon-El isn't back for the finale, I won't bother."
Supergirl,And no ones gonna miss it.
Supergirl,Thank God is over
Supergirl,The amount of salt over this show is wild.
Supergirl,She’s just hot. Damn
Supergirl,TIL there was a Supergirl series
Supergirl,Who is watching these shows? Seriously?
Supergirl,"People watched supergirl, I remember watching 1 episode back in the first season and the aliens had worst cgi then men in black

(The original trilogy, obvi)"
Supergirl,Cant wait to watch!
Supergirl,I could have sworn that show was canceled after 3 or so episodes
Supergirl,Someone watched this?
Supergirl,"I’ll say it for everyone else, “that’s still on?”"
Supergirl,Did anyone honestly watch this show?
Supergirl,I'm gonna miss this show regardless of what people say... :/
Supergirl,"Like a fart in the wind, unpleasant but mercifully quickly gone"
Supergirl,Wow i thought it finished years ago :D
Supergirl,I have literally never spoken to anyone who had ever watched this.
Supergirl,Omgggg what😧😧
Supergirl,So I’m assuming Supergirl makes it to the final episode.
Supergirl,"This show is dogshit. One of the worst acted, worst scripted and worst produced shows ever."
Supergirl,I’m going to miss this cast and show so much! 😭😭
Supergirl,Absolutely love her
Supergirl,Didn't Jeb Bush out himself as having a crush on this actress?
Supergirl,Her likability pulled a lot of the shows weight tbf. What a joy to watch.
Supergirl,Hey she’s the girl from the fappening!
Supergirl,"More like ""that's crap""."
Supergirl,She'll always has a careers in porn...
Supergirl,Thank fuck
Supergirl,I can’t believe reddit isn’t downvoting everyone shitting on this show. Typically any female lead show is “stunning and brave” no matter how horrible it actually is.
Supergirl,"Never watched more than the first episode. I watched all of Smallville tho.

Then again... I never watched arrow, or the flash or any other CW show *since* Smallville tbh. Supergirl just convinced me to not watch any of the other stuff."

David Beckham: Into the Unknown,"God, that show sucks"
David Beckham: Into the Unknown,I tried to give that show a chance but it was all too stupid.  Like when they met their counterparts how did none of them figure it out?  They all just fought like monkeys.
David Beckham: Into the Unknown,"I know he´s loved, and i know a lot of people think he improves things. 

but i fucking hate him, i dont see the point."

David Beckham: Into the Unknown,"they buried the lede- nick offerman is also part of the cast.

also- any word about when they expect it to air..?"
David Beckham: Into the Unknown,"Pretty good show so far but it's doing that thing where the kids are the extremely unrealistic kind of smart kids. Like the kind of 10 year olds that would get every reference in The French Dispatch and simply do not have real-life counterparts lol.

Edit - wow there's like 10 people on reddit who really hate David Cross for some reason lol. And they all have that really good justification 'Ugh I hate that guy'."
David Beckham: Into the Unknown,"Ugh, bummer."

She shut down an entire production by violating her contract, costing people jobs, and other people their dreams, because she refused to work with a young Patton Oswalt, who she didn't think was good enough to be on stage with her. She's an entitled, arrogant POS diva."

David Beckham: Into the Unknown,"I stopped as well. I get my quirky superhero fix from doom patrol. 

The first two episodes of season 1 used all the coolness of the show up. Shroud jr zipping around killing people in the diner was great.

Seems like all the characters just do the same thing over and over"
David Beckham: Into the Unknown,"Eh, hold onto your ass because season 3 was annoying as hell."
David Beckham: Into the Unknown,Nice to see him going for more prestigious roles. He deserved an Oscar for the wheelchair fight in Scary Movie 2
David Beckham: Into the Unknown,Tbf the last season also suffered from shitty writing. If anything it looks like they're trying to recover from that one by bringing in some big guns.
David Beckham: Into the Unknown,"Season 3 was a joke, so it makes sense"
David Beckham: Into the Unknown,Well it's not like the writing can get any worst... Can it?
David Beckham: Into the Unknown,Check out “The Founder”. He’s great as one of the McDonald brothers in that movie
David Beckham: Into the Unknown,Check out Devs! He's amazing in that one
Cleverman,"Its really interesting how it came to be made. Basically the creator wanted his son to have an Aboriginal superhero to look up to. All of the stories are based on real dreamtime stories, used with permission from the traditional storytellers. "
Cleverman,"Just watched the first episode. It's really good — story's intriguing, the cast are all great and I really dug the worldbuilding.

And I've got to say, Australian sci-fi television is otherwise basically nonexistent so it's a bit of a relief that this actually turned out to be a good show."
Cleverman,"Damn, poor Jorah had to cross dimensions to find the cure for greyscale. "
Cleverman,"Just watched it.   Looking forward to finding out more about how the 'cleverman' powers work.  Curious about why a media mogul would have a relationship with what seems to be a Shaman-like person.    Hopefully the young bar owner is in for a forcible crash course on how to not be an arsehole.  There are more characters and storylines than I expected.   So far, so good."
Cleverman,"Looks excellent, good production value, good cast. Lots of promise. I don't see a problem with the show tackling the treatment of Aboriginals because Australian entertainment media usually dances around this.

In the US we have countless shows where the treatment of minorities is a key theme and nobody complains. Seems like a lot of Aussies don't like feeling like the antagonist."
Cleverman,"It's really good. Reminds me a little bit of Orphan Black meets District 9. Borrows a bit from X-Men.

 It is a little heavy handed at times, but the characters are well developed and complex enough for them to get away with it. (And I feel we have pussyfooted around most of the issues for to long anyway, but that is just my opinion). The scene in the detention center hits a bit too close to home, both from what I have seen in offshore detention centers and domestic detention of indigenous people. 

The soundtrack is great. Lots of Australian artists, some good variety of genre. Nice art, has sort of simple cyberpunk feel, not too over the top, but definitely futuristic. Sorta like Looper. From my (limited) understanding of indigenous culture everything feels pretty authentic, and I recognize some of the dream-time stories. (i.e they haven't made up a bunch of bullshit mythology) 

Iain Glen (Ser Jorah) is always fantastic. If you haven't already, watch the Jack Taylor mini series. 

It's a 6 episode series, which I think fits well, there will be no filler, and the 50 minute format is good for pacing. 

I think this is going to be one of the best Australian TV shows."
Cleverman,Hey is that about racism against the Aborigines? Hard to tell.
Cleverman,"Hadn't heard of it... looks pretty cool. Thanks for posting, OP."
Cleverman,"I watched it and loved it. It has a bit of a Jessica Jones vibe to it - a bit dark, a bit real, a bit superhero... and then there's all these Aussie voices and dreamtime stories to remind you that it's something different. 

The title sequence definitely makes me think of a well-produced Netflix show - and the music score was excellent throughout. A couple of the extra characters were a little overacted - but for all the main characters it was very compelling.

You also can't miss the undertones in the storyline that seem to be inspired by actual events, like Australia's treatment of asylum seekers. All of this only helps to make the script more relatable and for the most part they seem to work.

I'd definitely watch it again."
Cleverman,"For Australians, it is streaming now through iView; but probably get-blocked for rest of the world. "
Cleverman,"I found that it was a good start, and the ending really makes me want to see where they go in episode 2, I do think they needed to do a bit more world building, but hopefully we will get more of that going forward.

[Full Review](https://tldrmoviereviewsblog.wordpress.com/2016/06/04/tv-review-cleverman-first-contact/)"
Cleverman,Thanks for sharing!...i was looking for something new to watch this summer.
Cleverman,It's a great looking series! 
Cleverman,"They do a much better job of giving the world more context in Ep 2, we actually get some explanation about the world and what the key divisions will be moving forward and indeed a couple of hints as to the end game for the season. I'm much more excited after [Containment](https://tldrmoviereviewsblog.wordpress.com/2016/06/09/tv-review-cleverman-containment/) and damn that ending was brutal "
Cleverman,Saw the first two episodes two months ago. Absolutely didn't like it. Heavy handed and riding tropes. It seems like their budget was a bit tight too. The slums/mutant city we and the population are supposed to fear was basically one big warehouse and a few buildings with 200 people at best.
Cleverman,"'Glitch' was a similarly excellent to series, which aired about 12 months ago on ABC"
Cleverman,Kinda reminded me of [Alien Nation](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0096531/).
Cleverman,"Came across it because of an interview with Iain Glen about GoT.

Not really impressed.

It seems like it might be a slow build into an enjoyable show, but the episode tried too hard to interconnect every character with every other character right away. The lore seems possibly interesting, but again like too much was shoved in right away. The acting seemed to be competent, but the writing wasn't there for anyone to shine. As some have said, the set seemed ""cheap"".

As for the heavy-handed comparisons to Aboriginal issues; I didn't mind it. One of the most important powers of TV and entertainment in general for me is taking an uncomfortable reality and adapting it in a digestible way, which I feel this has done relatively well.

With all that said, I'll probably watch another couple of episodes before deciding if I'll follow it or not."
Cleverman,"At first I thought it was just another [""white people are evil""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nN9hy4YNIv0) show but the sibling rivalry might be a good storyline and the whole cleverman mythology thing could be very interesting. 

We'll see! "
Cleverman,Watching it right now. Really engaged!
Cleverman,"I love that this show is inventive, produced and written by Aboriginal Australians with reference to Dreaming stories, and political. 

"
Cleverman,"I'll check it out, doesn't look too shabby. My only issues is running through my mind were the look looks like the [Gieco Caveman](http://alterianinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/caveman.jpg) and I got a strong District 9/Containment (CW) vibe from it. Throw in a sprinkling of Alphas (SYFY) and that is what I get from this show. Also the trailer was really heavy handed, boarding on one dimensional with the only thing being presented is the rift of hate between the humans and sub-humans. Feels like it needs another layer...a epic love story or a conspiracy or a giant question like what are they or where did they come from? But all I get is ""humans hate the sub-humans, kill them cause we fear them."" "
Cleverman,"It's pretty OK, I am a little curious about the world they are building. 

If I heard right, there are 80k people living in the zone, some / most of which are harries, supposed sub-humans that are stronger than normal humans and look pretty drastically different. How did this world come to be? Like, has this zone been going on since colonization? Or did the harries only just get discovered? If so, how? Where on earth were they hiding beforehand and why can't they just go back there instead of living in the slums? 

The acting seems decent enough, as do the special effects, but it's nothing outstanding. Hopefully the coming episodes can make it actually stand out & tell an interesting story. "
Cleverman,So... Jorah dies?!
Cleverman,So why the fuck do the disenfranchised class in these stories always have superpowers?
Cleverman,"Actually looks pretty boring.  The cinematography appears juvenile for today's standards. And the story just seems to be a knock off District 9.  Today you need one hell of a story line to grab young people's attention, and this one falls short of that.  So many shows are created today almost as filler for the insatiable appetite of the ""sitting generation."" "
Cleverman,[removed]
Cleverman,RIP Farscape (mostly american funded though)
Cleverman,"Australian sci-fi for kids and teens used to really great. Miraculous mellops, ocean girl, thunderstone, spellbinder...."
Cleverman,Where did you watch it? Is it streaming anywhere?
Cleverman,"Most of Australia's Sci-Fi is low budget; i.e. Terminus, AirLock etc. but what we do is generally good, and identifies readily as Australian. 

I worked on one called 'Blue World Order', which will be out later this year; keep an eye out... Check the website

Nice to see films like Alien5/Prometheus being filmed in Sydney, right now...  "
Cleverman,They don't call him Jorah the Explorah for nothing.
Cleverman,At least he appears to have a more successful love life in this one.
Cleverman,Eh we should probably have spoiler filtered this
Cleverman,"> Reminds me a little bit of Orphan Black meets District 9. Borrows a bit from X-Men.

Sold. Those are two things that I absolutely love and one thing that's pretty awesome in its own right."
Cleverman,"I love that the show is, from the start, inherently political. Like you say, we've pussy footed around issues for long enough down here. Time to be honest. "
Cleverman,Yeah that was heavy-handed af.
Cleverman,"Not sure, might have to rewatch it"
Cleverman,"No problem.

I saw it trending on Twitter, so I checked it out. And it was actually pretty good. I'm definitely looking forward to new episodes."
Cleverman,"Oh, how the tables have turned..."
Cleverman,"> It seems like their budget was a bit tight too.

TV down here doesn't really come with huge budgets, you make do with what you've got. I didn't mind it personally"
Cleverman,"the heaviest of hands. had to stop after the bus scene so basically 5 minutes in. Come on! No one can honestly tell me that this is actually *good*. I mean I am all for stories for minorities and heritage and history but that a good show does not make. It may be ok for Australian television, with which I have no connection. I did however see the first episode of tomorrow when the war began. That show is also absolute shit. Sorry."
Cleverman,"Not necessarily, this show is only 6 episodes and he won't be in got much this season cause he's gone looking for a cure. There's plenty of time for him to do both shows"
Cleverman,"Wouldn't be much of a story if it was the overclass with the powers, huh? "
Cleverman,"Its less of ""they have superpowers because they are the disenfranchised"" more ""they are disenfranchised because they have superpowers"".

Its realistic for the small group of superpowered people to be oppressed by the frightened, ""normal"" majority. If this happened for real, I can't imagine humanity reacting any other way.

The inverse would be something like if Magneto succeeded in putting humans above mutants and it would be about humans overthrowing the mutant upperclass. Even then, its more interesting to be on the side that's oppressed and fighting back."
Cleverman,...but have you watched it?
Cleverman,are you ok
Cleverman,The show is nothing like that at all.
Cleverman,Yes but so good
Cleverman,Escape from Jupiter 
Cleverman,I recorded it on my PVR and watched it on actual TV. But it's on ABC iview.
Cleverman,"Iview

http://iview.abc.net.au/programs/cleverman/IP1402H001S00"
Cleverman,No kidding. There was even a swastika-like symbol for the authorities! Good grief.
Cleverman,Yeah it was.
Cleverman,"""I'm sorry this is not available in your country""

I had to turn my geoblocker off for this, that's a new one"
Cleverman,Its also the ABC so a bit more sensable.
Cleverman,"You stopped 5mins in and you think you're entitled to an opinion? How come we can have a thousand US shows about the treatment of African Americans but an Aussie show tackles the treatment of Aboriginals and it's ""preachy"" and ""heavy-handed?"" Get real."
Cleverman,"I mean... yes it would?

Why wouldn't it?"
Cleverman,It's completely unrealistic for them to have been oppressed by the normal majority before technology came along though. A show like this implies they have been oppressed for a long time.
Cleverman,"Tired of people treating me like trash because of my skin color, and tired of seeing propaganda support them."
Cleverman,Check out the dickheads comment history. He's obviously fucked in the head.
Cleverman,"Also via Sundance TV in the US. And it's on in Nz, but I dunno which channel"
Cleverman,"Here's the american version in ""Colony"": http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/colony/images/0/03/Tansauth1hq.jpg"
Cleverman,It would be far less entertaining and far more bleak. Though that's essentially the plot of the Mistborn series by Brandon Sanderson. The nobles have heritable magic but the enslaved underclass don't. Except the half breeds who are all supposed to be killed at birth anyway. 
Cleverman,"""special"" people apparently also have to be the underdogs. the other way around would be refreshing."
Cleverman,People treat you like trash because you are white? Where do you live? Hawai'i?
Cleverman,[This is the appropriate response I believe](http://i.imgur.com/QSePoaX.gif)
Cleverman,"It would be a proper examination of class, rather than just the same damn story over and over."
Cleverman,"That's the point.

At this point if someone is disenfranchised you're just waiting for them to turn out to be magic."
Cleverman,They live on the Internet and they’re oppressed by unknown teenagers saying silly things sometimes.
Cleverman,Looks like they use a really stupid method against hotlinking. Copy and Paste of the link should work.
Cleverman,But one of the big points of superhero stories is escapism and power fantasy. A proper examination of class is boring. Shooting elitist pricks with laser eyes is not. 
Cleverman,A story about powerful people oppressing powerless people is just a history documentary.
Cleverman,Episode one was great. Good acting and an interesting plot. This show looks to have lots of potential.
Cleverman,Does that mean anything? Can't they just cancel it if it drops in views?
Cleverman,"Sundance TV is not the one actually renewing it, they are the minor production partner.

The major production partner is the Australian equivalent of the BBC, the ABC, like the BBC they are a govt owned network and have a charter to create highly original content which is valued more on its originality than how well it rates."
Cleverman,The ABC is government-owned. The BBC isn't. 
Cleverman,"The ABC and BBC are both public corporattions (i.e govt owned)

[The royal charter and license, constitute the BBC as a public corporation with a mandate to provide broadcasting as a public service. BBC is funded by an annual license fee levied on the majority of UK residents owning a television set regardless of income.](https://www.google.com.au/?gws_rd=ssl#q=who+owns+the+bbc)

The only difference between the two is one is paid for by govt levy, the other direct by taxpayer dollars."
Cleverman,The BBC was established by Royal Charter. The point of the charter was to make the BBC independent. The BBC owns itself (though it can't sell itself).
Cleverman,"And like the ABC it can only exist due to govt collected funds, and they are both Public corporations.

The queen did not setup this charter, the uk govt did, it is royal in name only.

The BBC is not a private commercial station like Channel 4, it never has been"
Cleverman,"Channel 4 **is** owned by the government, making it the only state broadcaster nationally (the others are S4C and a stake in BBC Alba by devolved governments). 

The BBC is responsible for collecting the licence fee, not the Government. It's paid to a government account and paid at fixed sums every 6 months to the BBC. 

The BBC has its origin in the British Broadcasting Company, a commercial entity owned by Marconi, Vickers, GTC and others, before being re-established by Royal Charter. 

As the name suggests, a Royal Charter is established not by the political government directly but by the Privy Council. A chartered body has certain regulation by the PC, but isn't owned by the Government."
Cleverman,Australia did some pretty terrible thing to Aboriginals just because they were black and different. Segregating people because they are hairy is not all that outlandish.
Cleverman,"""I see no reason for these ""hairies"" to be treated this way in the show..""

Which is human history in a nut shell "
Cleverman,"> I see no reason for these ""hairies"" to be treated this way in the show..

Its a pretty heavy handed allusion to racism, as well as the treatment of native populations. Why did the Germans treat the Jews the way they did? mostly over petty differences, yet they were herded and killed over those differences.

> so far they seem like regular ordinary humans but with additional hair

That and I think they're at least a little stronger than the average human.

> so why call them sub humans..why the fear..why break them apart

Its the 'other' that people fear, like the mutants in X-Men. They're not really sub-human but its much easier to get people to hate something by pointing out its differences as opposed to their similarities.

>  hairies turns into some crazy creature that needs to kill humans or something this entire show seems silly

Except that would make the humans almost justified in their horrid treatment of them, could even be argued that they should just kill them to prevent one or many of them going on a mass-murder spree."
Cleverman,"Yeah, superpowers are entirely silly, which is why we are currently seeing more of it throughout tv, film, comics....

It's about bloody time we had our own superhero, and I'm happy it's Cleverman. (It's not just a title)

If anyone wants worlds thoroughly explained in the opening sequence, then perhaps this kind of thought provoking show isn't for them. "
Cleverman,"How's that any different from the Holocaust, Apartheid or slavery?"
Cleverman,"Beyond all that though, the show wasn't very good.  I erased the timer.  Nope. "
Cleverman,"I think they're also supposed to be physically stronger.

And segregating people based on appearance is not at all unusual for the human race. They're calls sub-humans, because they're seen as more primitive than the rest of us."
Cleverman,"They resolve their issues by fighting.

They don't seem very bright."
Cleverman,"Yeah the show was cool and all but they just didnt set up the world enough. You dont really understand where they came from, where they live, how many there are.....I dont know, I wanted to like it badly but I found it kind of off the mark"
Cleverman,"name one country that didnt do wrong by its native peoples ? no ones innocent 

so saying cause its Australia is BS.. this show is filmed in the future.. and Australia is multi-cultural... most of the time its more brown/yellow and black then white in towns.. so this race card thing isnt a believable excuse for me.."
Cleverman,"thought provoking show.. u mean like the thought.. why are an entire class of humans being forced into a camp for simply having more hair ?

LOL

"
Cleverman,"so we isolate all violent individuals and call them sub humans ?

come on man.. violence is in all humans..

is there something more to these ""sub humans"" or is hair and anger all it is"
Cleverman,"> They resolve their issues by fighting.

As opposed to all other people who are perfectly peaceful? One fight took place because their family was being taken away and another was voluntary between humans and a hairy... 

> They don't seem very bright.

Based off what exactly? There was nothing to indicate their level of intelligence."
Cleverman,they have alot of info to give us.. ill give it 1 more episode before i make my mind up
Cleverman,"> You dont really understand where they came from, where they live, how many there are

I'm pretty sure 'Jorah Mormont' said the hairies have been here/around for more than 60,000 years, likely a subset of the Aboriginal population which would mean there aren't that many of them. They live in their designated zone, but Australia is a very large country so there are probably more zones and some may still live as their ancestors did... in the Outback."
Cleverman,Some of the reviews I've read have said that the second episode does a much better job of setting up the world and each character's motivations. 
Cleverman,Like that's an excuse you dopey fuck.
Cleverman,"I suppose it makes it okay if a handful of other country did it, too?"
Cleverman,"The entire point of the show is to be a futuristic (and perhaps heavy-handed) allegory to the bad stuff that did take place.

It's not just Australian media. Segregation based on appearance is a theme that appears in a lot of sci-fi in all areas that has had such issues in the past."
The American Bible Challenge,"Jeopardy is considered intellectual compared to other game shows because it’s very rigid in its presentation and relatively low on gimmicks. Other American game shows are much more “fun” in their execution. Jeopardy also has a lot of trivia about high art subjects, so it’s information that a more mainstream audience won’t necessarily be familiar with."
The American Bible Challenge,University Challenge is great!!  I thought the appearance of Scumbag College was a series highlight.
The American Bible Challenge,"As an American the only clip I've seen is when the team from Scumbag College gets crushed to death by a giant Eclair after they used a grenade to blow up their competition from Footlights College, Oxbridge."
The American Bible Challenge,"I've been involved in quizzing on both sides of the pond for a while.  Americans tend not to tolerate the quizzes where it's considered an accomplishment to get a third of the answers right, where the Brits seem to eat that kind of stuff up.

Jeopardy does a good job of making sure that even the casual viewer will likely get 50% right while still offering challenging material for the higher level player.  University Challenge and Only Connect don't care about coddling - if you can't get it - tough.

University Challenge is based off an American format (College Bowl).  The original College Bowl had the same attitude of not worrying about the viewer, but people tend to forget the show was a low rated affair that aired on Sunday afternoons and was propped up by GE wanting a prestige television show.  Later attempts to bring the show back have been either very short lived or dumbed down the material as in the current revival."
The American Bible Challenge,"About thirty years ago I remember American university teams coming over to the UK to compete.

They gave a good account of themselves, Baltimore University seems to stand out in my memory as being particularly good."
The American Bible Challenge,"University Challenge was an adaptation of the US’s College Bowl. University Challenge is definitely much more successful and long lasting, though. I’ve seen bits and pieces of UC but I haven’t seen a full episode. 

Fun facts: ITV is about to produce a UK version of Jeopardy hosted by Stephen Fry,  and [Brandon Blackwell](https://youtu.be/ca69IzCOgmY), who was a contestant on University Challenge, is now a chaser on the US version of The Chase."
The American Bible Challenge,The posh kids from Footlights College Oxbridge win far too often
The American Bible Challenge,Canadian here. We have watched University Challenge and also that other quiz show with the hieroglyphs (can't remember the name) but didn't continue watching either of them long term. University Challenge is much more difficult than Jeopardy!. I suppose we enjoy Jeopardy! because we can actually answer and play along as a family.
The American Bible Challenge,It's the show they talk about on Detectorists! Aside from that I don't know much about it.
The American Bible Challenge,I love University Challenge. I watch it on YouTube and I'm always amazed by how little I know. I know Paxman has a reputation for being a bit of an ass but I love the way he hosts and I'll be sad to see him go.
The American Bible Challenge,Only Connect is the most interesting quiz show. Lateral thinking is fun. What sucks is that the knowledge required is way too UK-centric to play along with from the US.
The American Bible Challenge,Don't care. Give me Only Connect!
The American Bible Challenge,I've never heard of it
The American Bible Challenge,"The main impression I get from the little I've seen of this (assuming its the one with usually 3 University teams being asked questions by a very bored and sarcastic presenter at a rapid-fire pace) is that it seems...very similar to like Academic Quiz Bowl stuff.  From what I know of those, they're significantly less impressive and less interesting than something like Jeopardy, thanks to the format.  Giving a group of students a selection of subjects to study and then asking esoteric questions about that subject is a lot less interesting than giving people trivia questions on topics they weren't specifically preparing for.  The group setting lowers the stakes, and not knowing anything about the backgrounds of the schools that compete makes it really hard to tell if I'm watching the equivalent of the Yankees taking on a AA ball team, which it feels like is what happens half the time.  Jeopardy's strategy of relying on some pun or relation to the category also makes it both easier for people at home to follow along, and serve to make the game interesting, because it provides a secondary way for contestants to guess at answers, rather than just being constantly asked questions where no one on any team knows the answers."
The American Bible Challenge,">which gave the impression that Jeopardy! is seen as a fairly high-minded quiz show.

**Jeopardy! (British game show)**

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeopardy!\_(British\_game\_show)

Jeopardy! is a British game show based on the US version of the same title. It was originally aired on Channel 4 from January 12, 1983, to July 2, 1984, hosted by Derek Hobson, then was revived by ITV from September 3, 1990, to April 9, 1993, first hosted by Chris Donat in 1990 and then hosted by Steve Jones from 1991 to 1993 and then finally on Sky One from December 4, 1995, to June 7, 1996, hosted by Paul Ross.  
***On 27 February 2023, ITV announced that the show would be revived for the third time in the autumn (the second time on ITV). This time presented by Stephen Fry.\[1\]***

&#x200B;

>So, in this age of global media, I was wondering if people in the USA were aware of it, if many people watch it even - and if so, what you make of it?

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College\_Bowl

**College Bowl (which has carried a naming rights sponsor, initially General Electric and later Capital One) is a radio, television, and student quiz show**. College Bowl first aired on the NBC Radio Network in 1953 as College Quiz Bowl. It then moved to American television broadcast networks, airing from 1959 to 1963 on CBS and from 1963 to 1970 on NBC. In 1977, the president of College Bowl, Richard Reid, developed it into a non-televised national championship competition on campuses across America through an affiliation with the Association of College Unions International (ACUI), which lasted for 31 years. In 1989, College Bowl introduced a (sponsored) version of College Bowl for Historically Black Colleges (HBCUs) called Honda Campus All-Star Challenge (HCASC) which is ongoing. In 2007, College Bowl produced a new version and format of the game as an international championship in Africa, called Africa Challenge (Celtel Africa Challenge, Zain Africa Challenge). The College Bowl Campus Program and National Championship ran until 2008.  
In November 2020, NBC announced a revival of the show, developed from the format of Honda Campus All-Star Challenge and Africa Challenge, with Peyton Manning as host and a ten-episode run ordered.\[1\] The revival, Capital One College Bowl, premiered on June 22, 2021"
The American Bible Challenge,"I've never much liked these sorts of quiz shows because they're really designed to make the audience feel smarter than they are. While there might be some value to knowing what Taylor Swift's fourth album was named or who played second base for the Royals in their last World Series, these are not piece of information that are the hallmark of the educated individual.

I think a far better 'quiz show' is the British show QI. Here, the questions are ridiculously obscure and often prompt an intelligent discussion rather than just being canned pieces of trivia."
The American Bible Challenge,"I don't think about it. I don't watch game shows or crappy ""reality"" tv show or survival shows like Survivor."
The American Bible Challenge,"university challenge is absurdly difficult, it seems like it requires a lot of niche knowledge whereas jeopardy is mostly what can be considered general knowledge"
The American Bible Challenge,"I remember University Challenge. Does the UK still have ""Mastermind""? That was more difficult."
The American Bible Challenge,"For 10 points, who made the world's stupidest bottom burp?"
The American Bible Challenge,It was entirely because of that episode that they no longer seat one team on a platform above the other.
The American Bible Challenge,Crop rotation in the fourteenth century was *considerably* more widespread after John.
The American Bible Challenge,"Rah rah rah!

The American Bible Challenge,I never knew about College Bowl. University Challenge has always seemed like a very British institution!
The American Bible Challenge,"Oh, I like the sound of that - a transatlantic/international version would be great!"
The American Bible Challenge,"it doesn't help they dominate the show by having each college of the university field a team.

some other universitys only have 1 team."
The American Bible Challenge,"Yeah, some of them are *a bit much*...

Unfortunately, they're also the type that end up running the country from Westminster."
The American Bible Challenge,"*Only Connect*, with the hieroglyphs. Yeah, that one requires a brain that's wired up *differently*. I can manage the missing letters round fairly well, but the lateral thinking involved for some of the others has me reeling."
The American Bible Challenge,"The best example I can remember is one question that turned out to be the lyrics to The Wombles tv show as told through London Underground signs. Just a big old ""????????"" from me."

Tell me you’ve never seen university challenge without telling me you’ve never seen university challenge. 

Go grab a random episode on YouTube."
The American Bible Challenge,Great to know - thanks.
The American Bible Challenge,"Jeopardy is easy as a viewer, but apparently quite difficult as a contestant. I've only watched a few episodes of University Challenge, and while I knew far fewer answers than I would watching jeopardy, I knew about as much, or a bit more than the contestants."

The American Bible Challenge,"I get the music question on Only Connect right more often than the teams do, which I understand is quite the accomplishment. 

Part of the challenge of the music question comes from Youtube occasionally muting one of the songs for copyright reasons, haha."
The American Bible Challenge,Yes a team of the most successful trivia players in history can probably beat a bunch of college kids
The American Bible Challenge,Paul Ross had a decent run of it. Even had some work after cheating on his wife with a man on a drug binge.

The American Bible Challenge,"Victoria Cohen-Mitchell is an unusual host, too. I like her; she's a genuinely smart cookie - but she's so incredibly *wooden*.

The American Bible Challenge,"Typical, bunch of Oxbridge wannabes"
The American Bible Challenge,"Fox was really weird around then about green lighting these interesting, unusual, atypical types of shows and then doing everything in their power to kill them upon launch. I always got the impression that either there was a regime change where a bunch of people approved the shows and then left, or there was just a ton of tension between the execs who approved projects, the schedulers, and the people in charge of marketing.

Remember when *Family Guy* came back, and Peter led off with this long list of shows, saying something like ""We can only come back if all of these were cancelled?"" There were some real gems in that list."
The American Bible Challenge,"> Years later, the actor pitched a new live-action take on the character, which Amazon debuted in 2016 but with Peter Serafinowicz as the lead. (This version lasted two seasons.) “I really did wish we got to do it,” laments Warburton of not reprising the role.

I wish the [2016 version](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Tick_\(2016_TV_series\)) lasted a few more seasons. It was great. Amazon dropped it after two seasons and while the creator was shopping it around the actor's contracts all expired"
The American Bible Challenge,Never before in the history of everything was there a better casting choice than the pairing of Patrick Warburton as The Tick.
The American Bible Challenge,I really loved this show. Sad it’s gone.

The American Bible Challenge,To think the animated series had more seasons than the live-action shows.
The American Bible Challenge,"Sonnenfeld has put up some amazing TV. The Tick, Pushing Daisies, etc. It's hard to grasp how easily something like a live action The Tick could have gone horribly wrong and disappointed everyone. It's a bummer it wasn't able to have the run it deserved, but at least everyone involved can be proud as hell.

*Spoooooooooooon!*

**Edit:** As a side note, lookup the film *An Honest Liar* which he produced about one of my personal heroes -- The Amazing Randi who used his knowledge as a magician to out charlatans and frauds. Fantastic documentary."

The American Bible Challenge,"I’ve never seen this show. Between The Tick and the lady on the right, I would’ve SWORN this was the cast of the Big Bang Theory in costumes at first glance. It looked exactly like Jim Parsons and Kaley Cuoco. Then the guy in between them looks like Johnny Galecki with the glasses on lmao"
The American Bible Challenge,"They forgot that the best way to deal with Fox is to do what you want, let them cancel you, get super popular offline, sign a better deal with them, bad mouth them in your first episode back. Rinse and repeat if you're a legend"
The American Bible Challenge,Newer Tick was great at least.
The American Bible Challenge,"I was a huge fan of the animated series and was really looking forward to this version when it premiered back in 2001. I last two episodes before I stopped watching. Other than the casting of Patrick Warburton, ""The Tick"" just fell totally flat for me. It had little of the fun or energy of the animated series. I still don't get what this version of the show was going for."
The American Bible Challenge,"From what I remember, the team fucking blew all of their money on mundane shit like entirely cgi'ing out the suit's seams among other things.  I think Fox realized this was going downhill and put a cork in the leak."
The American Bible Challenge,Every Sci-Fi show ever made by FOX: join the club...
The American Bible Challenge,Why don't they just revive the animated show? It would be perfect for Adult Swim or a streaming service
The American Bible Challenge,Fox murdered a lot of good shows.  They cancelled family guy and firefly.
The American Bible Challenge,The newer Tick with Serafinowicz was much better. And cooler. Got mad when it got cancelled.
The American Bible Challenge,"This is one of the biggest tragedies in tv history. The show was phenomenal, and was only getting better. Amazon screwed us all."
The American Bible Challenge,If they would have done the villians it might have lasted.  I guess they didn't have the money for it.
The American Bible Challenge,I loved the Tick cartoon.  Hated this show.
The American Bible Challenge,Isn’t Fox’s MO to cancel anything that is popular?
The American Bible Challenge,"Keep in mind that Fox programming is also a reflection of the political environment and what subtext Fox wants to push.  Bill Clinton wins presidency in 1992 election.  Better make people not trust their government!!  X-Files premieres in September of 1993.  The government is lying to you!!  The government is conspiring with aliens!!  And they ALWAYS make sure to show Bill Clinton's portrait in Skinner's office.  

Bush ""wins"" in 2000.  Time to use any means necessary to fight terrorism and prevent attacks.  Oh and an added bonus: Jack Baurer would've fixed everything in the first hour if weren't for those pesky regulations and government bureaucracy.  Also, torture is totally cool.

The health care debate roars back to life.  Better start a show showing how the American Healthcare system is the best in the world.  On the show House the best and brightest minds solve medical mysteries, conduct expensive tests at the drop of a hat because every instrument is available all the time with no waiting!  In one hour the patient goes from dying to cured and no mention of the hospital bills.  Oh, except for the **hospital's** bills.  It can't make enough money to stay afloat!  American health care is just *too cheap to make a profit*!  Added bonus: painkillers are an awesome super-pill that let's House save lives!  

Now, I used to watch and enjoy these shows.  But as the FOX mask slipped and the conglomerate became more brazen with pushing ideology I started to notice that it wasn't only Fox News that was doing this.

Edit: corrected a year"
The American Bible Challenge,They have been trying to make that damn show live action since the 90’s and it doesn’t work. Go back to animated!
The American Bible Challenge,"It would have been hard to outdo the cartoon when the budget doesnt really constrain creativity in a cartoon.  Maybe drawing something more complex would take a little longer, but not totally impractical to do in live action. It would have been better if they continued the cartoon with these actors doing the voice work."
The American Bible Challenge,"But they are really great at spreading misinformation, or is it disinformation, or maybe it’s just bad information… let’s just say Fox is pure garbage and call it a day."

But I’ve been to 501st Legion cosplay events where little kids will hug a Lord Vader cosplayer. They sort of love him like he’s part toy or maybe they feel for the orphan gone wrong. On the list the Wicked Witch was third, after Hannibal Lecter. I think she should be first. No kids would hug a good cosplaying actress of that in my opinion. The eagerness of those goddamn flying monkeys to serve her didn’t help. She’s terrifying and I’m a middle aged man. Can’t wait to watch this what a character Margaret Hamilton created"
Witches: A Century of Murder,"The episode itself was never “lost” per se. The whole show (this episode included) was preserved by the Library of Congress years ago, and not “supposedly” like the article said. You had to go down there to view it, but it was available.

Witches: A Century of Murder,*was always preserved by the library of congress. Slightly misleading but now it’s online so good stuff. What a piece of gold.
Witches: A Century of Murder,The episode from 1974 where Oscar is cursed by a with and he gets a nose scarred me for life.
Witches: A Century of Murder,I remember a Mr Rodgers episode where he had her on.
Witches: A Century of Murder,Funny when he asks her if she wants a cup of coffee and she says she doesn’t drink coffee. A little joke for the adults because she did the Maxwell House coffee ads for years.
Witches: A Century of Murder,is it too scary for my adult sons to watch?
Witches: A Century of Murder,The episode should’ve been brought to you by the leathers O and Z.

This is one of the biggest Lost Media cases of all time!!"
Witches: A Century of Murder,FUCK YEAH!!
Witches: A Century of Murder,Those kids are a bunch of babies. I just watched it and it wasn’t scary at all.
Witches: A Century of Murder,"> Although never re-run or made available for home viewing, the episode has reportedly been archived, safe and sound, for years in the Library Of Congress.

I guess possibly mis-filed?"
Witches: A Century of Murder,Cant wait for the Blame it on Jorge video on it
Witches: A Century of Murder,I just listened to the History Chicks podcasts about this. Beckett(one of the hosts) actually talked about this and she remembers seeing it the one time it aired on TV
Witches: A Century of Murder,Parents have to be weaker than their kids. If kids could handle Courage the Cowardly Dog then they can handle this.
Witches: A Century of Murder,Are they gonna save like all the streaming only shows and movies from this era or are we just gonna lose it all?
Witches: A Century of Murder,I get it’s rare and all. But too scary? Really?
Witches: A Century of Murder,How do you watch it
Witches: A Century of Murder,This one traumatized me in 1990.
Witches: A Century of Murder,NO WAY I can’t believe this episode was found! I thought it was just a myth

And they say people nowadays are snowflakes, WTF is THAT old school snowflake nonsense??"
Witches: A Century of Murder,what year was that?
Witches: A Century of Murder,I saw this episode when I was a kid. This was the most awesome episode ever. People today are too sensitive.
Witches: A Century of Murder,"it’s crazy to think this was too scary for kids, and i grew up in a time with unlimited access to beheading videos."
Witches: A Century of Murder,Couldn’t they teach the kids what is on TV is fake back then? Or was that concept too hard for decent parents to understand?
Witches: A Century of Murder,Sesame Street is scary? Stop sensationalized.

Witches: A Century of Murder,Seeing this makes me want to see more of the 70s sesame street.
Witches: A Century of Murder,Why do I have a memory of seeing this if it never aired? Or did it?
Witches: A Century of Murder,"Oh, I remember that episode. ABC television in Australia showed it."
Witches: A Century of Murder,"As a 70s child, I was absolutely terrified of her. My father tried pointing out that it was the same woman in a Maxwell House or Folgers commercial while the Wizard of Oz aired on TV, but it didn’t help."

Dead Set,Poor guy was five episodes away from retirement
Dead Set,"Get well soon Norman. Say what you will about the show, but Daryl has been the one constant and is synonymous with TWD."
Dead Set,"“Oh shit, I’m… my memory is fuzzy and my head is aching, what happened?”

“You hit your head Norman. Let’s see how you’re doing. What year is it?”

“2013?”

“Oh, shit. No Norman. It’s *2022*.”

“…but… that’s… no… but we’re on the set of The Walking Dead.”

“…yeeeeeahhh.”"
Dead Set,Now he knows how we feel watching it.
Dead Set,That show is still on? Haven't the zombies died yet?
Dead Set,Until he exits retirement to be on one of the Walking Dead's 5 spin-offs that are set to debut.
Dead Set,Hilarious and original
Dead Set,Edgy
Dead Set,It's always the same trite comment.
Dead Set,Are comments like this still being made?
Dead Set,They use lotion
Dead Set,Also Ghostrider maybe
Dead Set,The fact that it has 6 upvotes makes me lose faith on humanity a little more…
Dead Set,Not sure disliking TWD is edgy is it? Even its fans don't like it.
Dead Set,"What did you expect praise? LOL, its a budget show what can you do"
Dead Set,"Yeah, I’m certain those 1.5 million members to the main twd sub don’t like it.

Or, people like it and you just can’t comprehend that a show you don’t like is loved by million others.

Which seems the most logical to you?"
Dead Set,Fans are loving the current season of TWD. Where have you been?
Dead Set,Watching better shows.
Dead Set,"Oof 

>Showrunner (for now)

Doesn't exactly inspire confidence"
Dead Set,"rofl, they will never stop milking thi8s

On the brightside, I know a number of fans wanted an anthology for a while. For those who watched the show, especially the middle seasons, they would always sneak some interesting narratives into the background of episodes.  The most interesting one to me was the country club one.  This could possibly be interesting."
Dead Set,"If they're really going to keep doing Walking Dead shows, they should do an animated one. It would at least be able to set itself apart stylistically so it would be somewhat more different than the other spinoffs are."
Dead Set,See an anthology in the world of the Walking Dead could work really well.  Interested to see how this develops.
Dead Set,"why even bother Fear the walking dead had good 2/3 seasons. It was pretty entertaining, and more grounded than over the top twd. And they killed it anyway, with new showrunner and killed all characters, time jump and that black guy from twd."
Dead Set,"I haven't given a damn about TWD franchise in a while, and I doubt that's going to change anytime soon, but an anthology series seems like the best way to go. Focus on telling smaller, human stories about people from all over the world surviving the zombie apocalypse.  We don't need some big season-long plot which will only kinda come together. With zombies, less is frequently more."
Dead Set,Thanks for the warning
Dead Set,"Oh great, another shit WD series."
Dead Set,11 hours in and nobody has said that the franchise itself is the walking dead? I'm here to change all that.
Dead Set,"TWD could have been a legit HBO competitor, instead they slashed the budget, didn't write the series towards and end goal and just milked it for as long as the ratings held out, I quit after season 6, what a shit show."
Dead Set,"Jesus Christ, lol, I had no idea yet another series was coming."
Dead Set,Many TWD characters don't live for very long.
Dead Set,The article I posted in the comments confirms it however leading me to believe they were floating the possibility of someone else showrunning but ultimately decided on her
Dead Set,"> rofl, they will never stop milking thi8s. On the brightside, I know a number of fans wanted an anthology

You just described supply and demand. Call it milking, but if you also admit there is an audience for it then I don’t get your point."
Dead Set,Still wish we had gotten Frank Darabont's planned season 2 episode about the fall of Atlanta that followed the soldier that ended up the zombie in the tank with Rick.
Dead Set,"I loved season 4-5 partially because of how awesome the sets and background story telling was, the country club always sticks out and It would be cool if they made an episode about it in this series."
Dead Set,It seems like this should have been the first attempted spin off when the show was still huge. I know so many people who dropped out because of the slow pace and increasing rare Zombie encounters.
Dead Set,This spinoff may toy with animation they said awhile back so it's possible
Dead Set,"Hey, a lot of season 6 has been pretty entertaining. But yeah, half of season 4 and pretty much all of season 5 were awful."
Dead Set,Got tired of seeing that Johnny Depp character from S1. Stopped there
Dead Set,This one at least seems promising given each episode will basically be a mini zombie movie. They can’t drag things out when every episode is a new story. Potential to explore so many different things too (assuming they get decent writers and the like)
Dead Set,"It could be shit but is it really that fucking hard to not judge the quality of a series before its even out with a trailer?

This sub would have 2 comments total if people actually enjoyed TV and watched any of it lol"
Dead Set,"Fear had a couple of really good seasons. I'd argue ""The Ranch"" season is the best of TWD franchise."
Dead Set,"And yet, Game of Thrones will forever be remembered as the show with the terrible ending while TWD is climbing back up to its former glory."
Dead Set,"It's 2 actually, this, which is Tales of TWD and the D&C spinoff.

There is also talks for other spinoffs like a Negan Sequel/Prequel series, there is also the 3 Rick Movies."
Dead Set,"But if they better adhered to the comic, most of them should have been around for a shorter duration.  They couldn't really reconcile the need to dramatically kill off characters (as being integral to the books) with the fandom surrounding some of them as a tv show cast."
Dead Set,"Yeah sure if you think several dozen fans on reddit mentioning wanting something like this years ago,  when the show was at its peak, warrants greenlight a show that costs millions.    I don't hear much about Fear these days, and Ive only met one person who watched World Beyond, and w/ this being the 4th announced spinoff, I don't think my assessment of the situation is an unfair one lol."
Dead Set,Yeah it could be cool if they worked something like that in there.  However its probably unlikely considering all the legal issues w/ him.
Dead Set,agreed ...im almost envisioning it as a zombie snowpiercer type thing
Dead Set,"I agree, especially since fear didnt end up being that different from the main show."
Dead Set,"Season 3 was exceptional, I still go back to rewatch it everyonce and a while. The first two seasons are mixed but by the second half of season 2 until the end of season 3 is amazing."
Dead Set,It still saddens me that they ruined the show after that. Ive never seen a show go down the shitter so fast
Dead Set,"Game of thrones finale was seen by 18 million on HBO alone, AMC gets about 2 million viewers, speaks volumes"
Dead Set,"Again.

> rofl, they will never stop milking thi8s. On the brightside, I know a number of fans wanted an anthology for a while.

You said it. 

I’m not saying or thinking anything, your describing supply and demand and that’s how television works.

Sorry this is so complicated for you.

Edit: that’s some terrible bait on your part"
Dead Set,"Most people in the US watch it through AMC+, I remember them saying that its couple a million people."
Dead Set,"\*you're, I'm sorry basic grammar is so complicated for you, boo <3"
Dead Set,"I saw Threads as a teenager in the 1980s and I still think it’s the most disturbing programme I’ve ever seen, or am likely to see. It’s brutal, and the ending...holy shit it’s depressing."
Dead Set,Is Ghostwatch the one that caused a kid to kill themselves?
Dead Set,"Yeah, I remember reading about that after I started Googling the film after I got the chance to watch it via Shudder a couple years ago (I think it's since been pulled). Amazing flick, btw! This is according to its [Wikipedia entry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghostwatch): 

>Eighteen-year-old factory worker Martin Denham, who suffered from [learning difficulties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning_disabilities) and had a [mental age](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_age) of 13, died by suicide five days after the programme aired. The family home had suffered with a faulty [central heating](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_heating) system which had caused the [pipes to knock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_hammer); Denham linked this to the activity in the show causing great worry. He left a suicide note reading ""if there are ghosts I will be ... with you always as a ghost""."
Dead Set,"Also ""White Christmas"" is an amazing episode of Black Mirror that isn't on Netflix staring Jon Ham, torrent that shit"
Dead Set,"Dead Set is as also far as I know the first zombie TV show, I remember first hearing about it due to this fact when The Walking Dead was announced and it was billed as the first of its kind. 

Great show, definitely recommend checking it out.

"
Dead Set,"I like Black Mirror because it's like hard sci-fi; no zombies or anything like that. Dead Set looks cool, but it looks like a different kind of show."
Dead Set,Check out Inside No. 9 I found that similar as well. Great series!
Dead Set,"Next fix of Black Mirror? Is more being made?
If so, woop.
If not, DAMN YOU TO HELL FOR GETTING MY HOPES UP."
Dead Set,Inside No 9 is the dark humor half hour version of black mirror
Dead Set,Dead Set is very enjoyable great choice to watch.
Dead Set,"You might also want to check out Humans which has just started on Channel 4. 

Not Brooker - but Brookeresque. "
Dead Set,"But the real question is, ""Do toes have bones in them?""

Edit: In case someone was curious...https://youtu.be/JNwTfK4Kddk?t=1m0s"
Dead Set,I've never loved a TV show more than black mirror. Coming from me that's means a lot.
Dead Set,"I own this, it's AMAZING. I'm a HUGE zombie person and this is one of the best zombie movies/mini series ever. "
Dead Set,Is Black Mirror popular in other countries besides the UK?
Dead Set,"Really enjoyed it, really well written. "
Dead Set,My favorite scene in Dead Set is when Riq is in the boat.. His face has completely changed after the fact.
Dead Set,"Agreed, it's quite dark and lots of fun."
Dead Set,Watched this a long time ago. Its pretty fucking good
Dead Set,"Now that I think about it, you could have easily released dead set as an episode of Black Mirror and no one who hadn't already seen it would have noticed!"
Dead Set,"Also of tangential interest: Brass Eye, a satire on modern society and news media, which Charlie Brooker did some writing for. It's straight up satirical comedy, but the tone is just about equally dark."
Dead Set,"Also Darknet, on Netflix streaming, is pretty great for horror fans who need a fix"
Dead Set,"More black mirror?  I thought it was just the six + the xmas special.

"
Dead Set,"Well just watch the whole series and yeah, pretty messed up ending. Kinda expected it seen as you said it was like Black Mirror. Thanks!"
Dead Set,Fantastic series. Fan's of Black Mirror will definitely enjoy it. 
Dead Set,"This premeired the same month Walking dead did. It was a Zombie Month and the start of more and more Zombie shows, Games and Movies."
Dead Set,So the only place I can find to watch black mirror in the USA is on netflix. Is there somewhere I can stream this? Because they did make more than the two seasons on netflix right? 
Dead Set,"I call that one the ""Anti_Christmas Special"".
It's very well done, but not what you call feel good Christmas special"
Dead Set,Or use a VPN and watch it on Channel 4 OD so it counts towards ratings.
Dead Set,"I wondered why the Netflix menu screen for Black Mirror had a picture of Jon Hamm, but I watched all the episodes and never saw him. Why doesn't Netflix have all of them? And WILL they ever?"
Dead Set,Probably my favorite episode. The ending was really good. It is hard to tell people what it is about without ruining it.
Dead Set,I was in awe at the christmas special. There was an empty feeling where I wondered if there'd ever be anything like it again. 
Dead Set,Ugh. Sooooo sad but I love it. 
Dead Set,"I find that really hard to believe, but am honestly struggling to think of another one before it."
Dead Set,AMC actually aired the whole series just before The Walking Dead premiered.
Dead Set,Check out the new film Ex Machina. Very 'black mirror' near future sci-fi. 
Dead Set,"Oh, yeah, it's very different- it's more the 'take the world and make one change' style."
Dead Set,"You should watch the new Channel 4 show ""Humans"" if you haven't. 

Episode 1 just aired this week and it's very Black Mirror in it's subject matter. It reminds me a lot of Utopia tonally too. I expect the season to be good."
Dead Set,"I believe there's a US remake coming, so take that for what it's worth."
Dead Set,[deleted]
Dead Set,Very Brookeresque 
Dead Set,"Is there anyone here who's seen both the original Swedish and Channel 4 versions? I was about to start the original when I heard they were doing a remake, and want to know if one is better or how closely the new one follows the old?"
Dead Set,It's fairly popular in the US.
Dead Set,I believe its pretty popular in China
Dead Set,"Hell yes! Plus it's Canadian, which is always nice to see.  This shit is genuinely scary."
Dead Set,It came out 2 years before TWD.

Disarmingly simple premise that allows the show to just be actors in a room acting, zero bullshit. And it's some of the best drama I've watched. Gabriel Byrne is astounding. It's also Mia Wasikowska's first role while she was still a teenager and she gives one of my favorite television performances ever.

Apparently it was a big deal back when it dropped, but you don't hear it come up much nowadays in discussions of HBO's greats, which is a shame. They tried some remake/reboot fourth season last year without Byrne which looks like a complete dumpster fire, but I've watched through season 1 so far and the original series is excellent."

Shetland,MI5/Spooks
Shetland,"19-2 (English version) is a really great police show, probably the best ever made."
Shetland,"Resident evil on Netflix

I swear no one has seen it"
Shetland,"Star Wars Andor. No one seems to talk about it here on reddit, but it's definitely the best tv show ever."
Shetland,"Severance. But I say this is as everyone I talk to has heard of it. But haven’t watched it. Severance is the best goddamn piece of media I’ve seen in years. 

Also Mythic Quest."
Shetland,"I think an issue I have with Banshee is that every time it comes up people say ""Banshee is great and totes underrated"" and no one says one word of what it's about, why they like it, who's in it, etc. I assume the fan base is inarticulate and not super deep thinkers. Kind of like the ""Chuck"" people. It's not an endorsement for a show really."
Shetland,"Freaks and Geeks. Suddenly it's one if the greatest shows ever. While it was on NBCfans were begging for network to finish the 1st season. In a 90s tv universe dominated by Beverly Hills 90210, be a Freaks and Geeks."
Shetland,Dark on Netflix. I haven’t seen it appreciated by the US public that much.
Shetland,"Colin's Sandwich, with the late Mel Smith."
Shetland,Centaurworld.
Shetland,"Z Rock, it was on IFC. It was about a metal band trying to get a record deal. To pay their bills they are a band like the Wiggles and are popular in NYC birthday party scene. Nobody is interested in their Metal Band but the guest stars kept pushing the Kiddie type songs. It had a lot of stars make cameos as themselves."
Shetland,"There was a 90s sitcom with Tony Shaloub and Neil Patrick Harris called Stark Raving Mad. Very 90s, but also very funny. 

I think Ryan Hansen Solves Crimes on Television* is hysterical, but I don’t know anyone who saw it.

Trapped,Trapped on Amazon Prime sounds like a great premise for a show
Trapped,Leaves Prime in two weeks which is annoying. Thanks for the recommendation though I’m going to check it out.
Trapped,"""Trapped"" is the name of the tv show btw, in case some people are confused at first like I was"
Trapped,There is a 3rd season on Netflix. They changed the name to Entrapped for some reason but it's the same show.
Trapped,"It is a good series, and is on Netflix in Canada. I didn’t like the second season as much as the first."
Trapped,"Oh this sounds great, thank you for the recommendation."
Trapped,"Check out The Minister if you know where to find it. It's a great show and Olaffsons's performance is beyond just about anything else I can think of. You won't understand unless you see it.

Don't watch any trailers because they're all really spoilery and misrepresent the tone of the show.

He also plays a fun villain in The Tourist."
Trapped,"Ólafur Darri Ólafsson is a wonderful actor. If you liked him in *Trapped*, you'll love him in *The Minister*. He plays the Prime Minister of Iceland in the throes of a psychotic break."
Trapped,https://youtu.be/I-OOpZitfd0
Trapped,"I watched this show a few years ago and LOVED it.  Whenever someone in r/mayorofkingstown asks about a similar show, I recommend Trapped."
Trapped,"There are actually a bunch of great Icelandic shows: Trapped(and the third season which is called Entrapped and, annoyingly, streams separately), The Valhalla Murders, The Lava Field, Stella Blomkvist."
Trapped,It is a brilliant show and watching the star as the Eurovision chief Icelandic judge in Fire Saga is such a ride. Also spent lol of season one thinking the Icelandic word for police was the name of the town
Trapped,I misunderstood the title the first time I read it and was gonna ask about the show name lmao
Trapped,Yup great show. I remember watching it when it was on Netflix.
Trapped,It’s a great show! But the first season was the best imo.

Trapped,Trapped is indeed a good show

Trapped,Same :)
Trapped,>Trapped on Amazon Prime
Trapped,Awesome thank you
Trapped,"Not in the US. The 3rd season “Entrapped” is on Netflix, but the first two seasons, “Trapped”, are not."
Trapped,For me it’s in the app on iOS right above the blue play bar.
Trapped,"Oh, we got both in EU. Maybe use a vpn 😄"
Trapped,I love the Buffy one and the supernatural one as well
Trapped,"Supernatural, 3x11, 'Mystery Spot'.

""It was the heat of the moment

Trapped,"X files had a fun one, I remember enjoying the outer limits episode with a time loop too. Just weird to see Kevin Nealon in a non comedy role"
Trapped,"The TNG one (cause and effect) is my personal favorite, and probably a top episode of the entire show for me."
Trapped,Misfits had a good one of these its first season
Trapped,There’s two incredible episodes of Fringe that had me crying. One was called “white tulip” And another called “and those we left behind”
Trapped,Here's an obscure one: Cloak and Dagger's episode was probably the best one in the show
Trapped,"Doctor Who (series 9, Heaven Sent). 12 Monkeys. Also the new Quantum Leap just did an great time loop episode.

Edit: kept messing up the DW episode title, sigh"
Trapped,Travelers.    Season 2 episode 7.   17 Minutes
Trapped,Lots of great ones have already been mentioned. I'd say the best one that hasn't been is the one from Legends of Tomorrow.
Trapped,"Been there, done that, episode of Xena the Warrior Princess."
Trapped,Agents of SHIELD had a good one in the last season.
Trapped,"Shows that had something similar but you wouldn't expect it:

Community - [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remedial\_Chaos\_Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remedial_Chaos_Theory)

Person of Interest - [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/If-Then-Else](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/If-Then-Else)

Blindspot (don't @ me) - [https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7808238/](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7808238/) Everlasting"
Trapped,"I only saw the title and immediately said ""Stargate"".  I think it's the only one I've actually liked."
Trapped,Agents of shield 7x09 As I Have Always Been
Trapped,"12 Monkeys Season 2 episode 8 ""Lullaby"""
Trapped,"Not a ""time-loop"" episode in the strictest sense, but...

Person of Interest, *If-Then-Else*."
Trapped,Every episode of season 1 of Russian Doll.
Trapped,I like the one from the Magicians
Trapped,"I agree with Stargate. Such a great episode I’ve watched a million times. 

The other that comes to mind is TNG’s Cause and Effect."
Trapped,"American Dad

Their Christmas episodes are always fire."
Trapped,"Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.- S7.E9: As I Have Always Been.

12 Monkeys - S2.E8: Lullaby.

Dark Matter - S3.E4: All the Time in the World."
Trapped,A Year of Hell from ST Voyager
Trapped,The mentioned “cause and effect” episode from TNG is probably the best. I can’t believe I’m about to recommend something from Star Trek Discovery but “Magic to Make the Sanest Man go Mad” is actually a really good spin on a similar concept.
Trapped,"The Agents Of SHIELD one was absolutely fantastic, and pretty funny. It knows its audience, knows the audience knows these episodes, and does things a bit differently or amusingly.

But I quite like Red Dwarf's riff on them in Future Echoes. Only the second episode ever, it takes the concept - seeing the future - and makes it *immediate*. Rather than experiencing the future all as one before returning to the start, the episode says ""here's a quick bit of the future, now here you are again experiencing it from the start - *and nothing you do will change the outcome*"".

This is best illustrated by Lister finding the Cat with a broken tooth in a ""future echo'"". He doesn't know what caused it, but decides he can change the future by preventing the Cat from breaking his tooth. Realising the Cat is about to try eating his robot goldfish and breaking his tooth on that, Lister wrestles the robot goldfish away from the Cat, and in the struggle breaks the Cat's tooth."
Trapped,The Librarians has a really good episode where the team is stuck in video game and only Ezekiel Jones remembers each time they respawn.
Trapped,If-Then-Else from Person of Interest. Perfect hour of TV.
Trapped,"Not exactly a timeloop, but Community's Remedial Chaos Theory resets each timeline. Fantastic episode."
Trapped,The Stargate Universe time loop episode was fantastic as well
Trapped,Russian Doll
Trapped,I really enjoyed Lost Girl's version of this.
Trapped,Yule. Tide. Repeat. -American dad
Trapped,"I still remember the ""Point of Salvation"" -------> >!""Oh, like a save point!""!< aha moment when I watched that episode of The Librarians and got to the twist."
Trapped,Stargate is the best one.  Legends of Tomorrow and ST:TNG were great.  Russian Doll season 1 was very good.  The Flash just did one and it was mediocre.
Trapped,First episode of Dirk Gently!
Trapped,Not a show but love how Palm Springs did it
Trapped,"Does Person of Interest's If-Then-Else count? If so, that.


If not, my #2 would be Fringe's White Tulip."
Trapped,There's an episode in the new Twilight Zone series where a woman finds out that a dude who seemingly knows everything about her is trapped in a time loop. She proceeds to beat his ass up after not taking no for an answer. There's more to it but I don't wanna give everything away. A very decent twist on the old concept.
Trapped,Future man.
Trapped,"Charmed has an outstanding Groundhog Day episode called ""Deja Vu All Over Again"". Season 1 episode 22. So well done.

Surprised at the Buffy mentions on here. It was only a couple minutes of Groundhog-ness...That's the power of Buffy though. Endlessly iconic."
Trapped,"Discovery season 1 had a good one, with the villain in control of the loop.  Also my favorite Discovery episode"
Trapped,"AoS

They go all the way,  

it's the same over and over. 

There are real consequences. 

It's funny. 

They do the intro credits more than once"
Trapped,"Doctor Who

>!Heaven Sent!<"
Trapped,"The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya: ""Endless Eight"" episodes.

Eight of the 28 episodes of the series are each mostly the same as the other seven, with slight differences, until the time loop is broken in the eighth episode. Thankfully, the repetitive episodes came in the second season.

They aired one after the other, in their regular weekly timeslot, so I can only imagine how frustrated viewers were as it first aired, wondering why this episode is pretty much the same as the last, and the one before that..."
Trapped,Heaven Sent from Dr Who is best example of this. It is also one of the best stories from the franchise overall.
Trapped,Remedial Chaos Theory.
Trapped,Extraordinary S1E8
Trapped,"It’s not exactly Groundhog Day style but Remember Me - Star Trek: TNG

There’s an intro which shows Dr. Crusher get caught up in a warp bubble but the first time I watched it, I missed that part.  All I saw was people disappearing off the Enterprise over and over with no one but Crusher remembering they even existed.  It was such a “what-the-hell-is-going-on” moment for me!"
Trapped,"Not TV, but the film Run Lola Run is a fantastic time loop film"
Trapped,I enjoyed the one in DC's Legends of Tomorrow. RIP
Trapped,Person Of Interest Episode *If Else Then*
Trapped,"Eureka season 3 episode 4 I Do Over

its one of my favourite time loop episodes and has such a sad ending"
Trapped,"American Dad ""Yule. Tide. Repeat."""
Trapped,"Tales from the Walking Dead had one. I liked it because it replayed several different examples from Day 1 of the outbreak.

I get it people are sick of zombie apocalypse shows, but we have very little that spend time in the initial craziness."
Trapped,LEGION
Trapped,Supernatural Season 3 episode 11 Mystery Spot
Trapped,"Technically a movie of a TV show (of a manga), but Urusei Yatsura: Beautiful Dreamer. I love how the uneasy sense of broken logic slowly creeps in as the characters gradually realise they’re trapped in a time loop."
Trapped,Not a TV show but “The Causality of the Sabzeruz Festival” Genshin Impact.

Its great and I was already a groundhog Day guy as it came out when I was like 13 so decent timing.

I already liked Supernatural and came across it but I doubt youd need much prior info to enjoy it."
Trapped,"Well you basically already listed most of my favorites, except for the first episode of Bravest Warriors, a web show by Pendleton Ward. I love it because at the beginning of the episode they find themselves from the previous time loop dead on the floor, so they try prevent that from happening, >!but at the end of the episode they die anyway in the same way next to their other dead selves, time loops back and when the next version of them sees two other versions already dead they say nope and just leave without fixing the time loop. Because even when knowing they were gonna die they couldn't stop it, so obviously they couldn't do it, better to just give up and dip.!<"
Trapped,Sealab 2021 - Lost in Time
Trapped,The series Daybreak was great
Trapped,"33 minutes from Battlestar Galactica. 

I know it doesn't really count, as it isn't a timeloop perse, but it was such a great (re)introduction to the concept of a fleet of refugees being hunted by calculating relentless robots."
Trapped,"“Mystery Spot” , Supernatural. Dark humour at its absolute best. The writers were on their A game for that episode!"
Trapped,"Eureka season 3 episode 4 I Do Over

its one of my favourite time loop episodes and has such a sad ending"

And the only two times he condemned his Neo-Nazis base was because his handlers forced him, because he previously said something so stupid. Piece of shit loves the racists & Nazis and their votes."

Race for the White House,Too bad Jimmy Kimmel isn’t funny though….
Race for the White House,"I want everyone who is mad at this to remember that the Twitter files was basically the exact same thing as this. The government trying to censor speech by pressuring private companies to do their bidding. If you are mad at this you should also be mad about the Twitter files.

Note I am not defending this. It is absolutely disposable with no qualifications. The correct answer is to condemn both."
Race for the White House,Who cares? Who watches Jimmy kimmel?
Race for the White House,"People are acting like no one else does this.

Race for the White House,Jimmy Kimmel went woke and lost his audience. No surprise there.
Race for the White House,"Kimmel has jokes? This is news to me. Making jokes about the president has always been a staple for late night, you make a joke or two, then you move on, Not spend every monologue for years on end. It was kinda funny in the beginning, but after about a month it was insane."
Race for the White House,I hate Trump as much as the next person with two brain cells to rub together. Kimmel is such a hack though. I used to like his monologue. Then Trump came along and it was half his monologue every fricking night.
Race for the White House,"The sad part is the left has been instructing big techs and medias to  censor but it is perfectly fine.   These includes talking of covid vaccine efficacy,  covid lab leak theory, or hunter biden laptop."

Nobody that high up in politics could be so stupid and thin-skinned as to not realise that getting wound up by comedians is exactly what fuels the comedians. And then along came Trump..."

Race for the White House,"There are a lot of nihilistic trolls that wanted and were happy with trump being elected because he's a buffoon and he gives everybody enough ammunition to point out what a fool he is, and he always does it to himself.

My middle aged wife has sharp wits and immediately recognized that high pitched whistle and replied ""Oh I looooove rap music! What don't you like about it?"" He was dumbfounded and mumbled some non-answer and essentially quit talking to us.

This article, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran_hostage_crisis, describes the events in a broader context and seems to include material in the “Hostages” doc. I can’t tell for sure since I don’t have access to it."
Hostages,"Does it touch on the fact that reagan purposefully struck a deal with the hostage takers to keep the hostages so he could make Jimmy Carter look bad and win his political race and would go easy on them and make sure Iran was very well compensated if he won? How the hell was reagan not strung for high treason? I know most presidents have all committed some pretty heinous crimes, but his 2 big ones really seem so far over the top of others and aren't in the ""did he do it?"" Category or muddled in murky waters like benghazi or something. What he did seems so far over the top heinous and yet he is regarded as a conservative hero when in fact he was as far away from conservative that could possibly be."
Hostages,It takes place in 1979 not the late 90's
Hostages,Sounds really interesting I’ll have to check it out
Hostages,Thanks for this. I just added it to my list. Good to know it’s going to be a captivating watch.
Hostages,It’s a great watch. It’s also a good gateway if you want to read more about the history of Iran. The history of colonisation and meddling in Iran by foreign nations explains a lot about it’s current state.
Hostages,"Thanks, I'm gonna cheggit."
Hostages,"I loved how well they laid out just how Jimmy Carter got so hated by the Iranians clearly. That never made sense to me as Carter wasn’t that kind of guy. 

But, and I’ve said this many times, Carter was a tragic figure in Presidential history.  He inherited so much bullshit that he had to go with.  The state was already in charge of so much of what we were doing in the world. 

He HATED the Shah. With a passion. But he quickly learned he had no choice but to play nice and supportive. There was MAJOR money coming our way. When you know a principled guy like Carter didn’t want to do any of that shit. 

But there he was in Tehran toasting to the Shah and offering our unwavering support. You know so many Iranians were watching this and just getting reinforced that the US is evil to support and prop up this monster."
Hostages,[deleted]
Hostages,Is this similar to Chernobyl?
Hostages,"You should really watch Argo with Ben Affleck, it is about how the hostages were rescued out of Iran

Edit: Fuck off with the downvotes, I'm allowed to like that movie!"
Hostages,I like how the documentary doesn’t dwell on minor events like the duel invasion and occupation of Iran by the Allies in WW2 or the coup of a democratic nation in the early 50’s that put the Shah into power… let’s not factor that stuff at all into the analysis
Hostages,Haven’t got to the last episode yet but they do start showing that Reagan was definitively using peoples frustration with how long this went on to garner votes and appear as a “strongman”.  But so far we are still in the Carter administration.
Hostages,"That is speculation, not fact. It's up there along with Roosevelt knew about Pearl Harbor beforehand."
Hostages,"No, it was not talked about in the doc. Wanna know why?

Because it’s not something substantiated. It’s a conspiracy theory. They did a good job of staying clear of such things."
Hostages,Yes I know.  Typo.  I fixed it.  Thanks.
Hostages,don't....
Hostages,Not only that-but this event seems to be the catalyst for a lot of our history in the US.  This event lead to the election of Reagan which lead to an entirely different era of conservatives in the US.
Hostages,Totally.  That was a typo.  Thanks.
Hostages,Chernobyl was a dramatization of events.  This is a full on documentary with historical footage and extensive interviews with people involved and political figures from the time.
Hostages,"Isn’t Argo About the 6 people who weren’t actually taken hostage and snuck off to the Canadian embassy and were smuggled out shortly after?  Not the 66 hostages who were held for 444 days, which is the topic of this doc."
Hostages,"Good movie, great thriller. But very inaccurate."
Hostages,"While Argo is an entertaining film, it contains a lot of historical inaccuracies"
Hostages,Good movie but it’s about the people that were hiding at that one ambassadors house if I remember correctly.
Hostages,The entire first episode covers the coup of 1953.
Hostages,"1953 was well covered and explained very clearly how the Iranian negative view of us was driven from that date 

Guy even said something to the effect of “there are two dates. 1979, which is big for us, and 1953, which is huge for them”."
Hostages,"He did a lot more then that, he actively struck a deal to have the abductors keep the hostages till the election and he told them he would give them a sweetheart deal. It was straight up treason and that really isn't being hyperbolic"
Hostages,Yeah and Ollie north was acquitted and is now the spokesman for the NRA. Every person in the CIA knew the truth. It's not a conspiracy theory.
Hostages,"Persian here, good documentary indeed, but it also didn't mentioned half of other events either, such as US strike on Iranian passenger plane that killed over 120 people (mostly persians) near Persian gulf.

Also, that Masoumeh Ebtekar is an actual bitch who held many official position in Iran since the 1979. If you hate her, the people in the office aren't any different from her and they all are nasty people. her son lives in US."
Hostages,Thanks.
Hostages,Correct.  Good movie though.  I typically don’t like Affleck but he’s great in that role.
Hostages,It doesn’t talk about it at all. All they say was the Shah came into power in the 50’s and that’s it. No mention of coup or nothing was ever talked about. If you could give me a time stamp I would appreciate it because I watched it to come up and it never did.
Hostages,"Sorry, must have blinked and missed it. Obviously such important events should be a sentence long while the girlfriend of the Iranian ambassador gets 5 minutes"
Hostages,GOP did same during Vietnam War.
Hostages,That’s actually a conspiracy theory. There’s no proof of it.
Hostages,Yeah - while this documentary is pretty dense with info and good at explaining things it's very clear there is a lot of other history that they don't get into  It's clear though that the US / Iran relations were just seemingly impossible to mend.
Hostages,Are you referring to Iran Air 655 that happened in 1988? Because that seems completely unrelated.
Hostages,"Don’t get me wrong….the shoot down of that plane was horrible and a tragic mark on us Americans. 

It’s also well outside the timeframe of the revolution and hostage crisis that is covered here."
Hostages,It was a huge part of the first episode. I think you may have fell asleep.
Hostages,"Ok, you get a point on that. That was too much time spent on a pointless bit. Ok, you dated the guy. I guess that makes you more credible. Because we know they average Persian man shares openly with his lovers. 

Though, it wasn’t just one sentence they spent on 1953 and how we clearly were involved in taking out a beloved populist PM of a constitutional monarchy and opened the door for a despot. 

It might not have been as long as they spent with a reporter talking on how she dated the Iranian ambassador, but it was close."
Hostages,Don't try and argue. People are posting an opinion they want to be true and calling it a fact.
Hostages,Was surprised the infected running out of the ground were real actors and not cgi.
Hostages,I sort of wish I didn't play the game.  Imagine not knowing what was about to happen.
Hostages,Lamar Johnson was a better Henry than I could have imagined.
Hostages,"As a fan of the game, I knew what was going to happen and I was still gutted. What a great episode."
Hostages,At first I wasn’t liking how they made Sam younger and deaf because I liked how Ellie and him were able to communicate with each other in the game like they were both at the same stage in life and were able to relate to each other and bond more. But I do think they still made it just as natural as in the game and in the TV show it seemed to be even a more intimate connection between Henry and Sam and that Henry had even more of a “big brother” role in the show that he had to take care after Sam. I think this made the ending of the episode even more powerful than the game which is something I didn’t think was possible.
Hostages,"ASL interpreter here.

They used deaf comedian, actor and scholar CJ Jones as a consultant for the language in this episode.

He was on set the whole time.

They treated deafness, ASL and deaf culture with tons of respect.

The older brother signed like someone who learned late in life, the younger brother signed like a deaf child.

At the end of the episode there are interviews. CJ Jones just let’s the kid talk and be him. He’s an incredible man.

Had a role in Fargo too. CJ Jones.

Look him up. Incredible human."
Hostages,I learned that Lamar was from Toronto a few hours before the episode and as soon as he started talking I could hear it in his voice lol. Luckily I wasn’t distracted by it because he was so good as Henry.
Hostages,I think episode 3 changing so drastically really let even those who played the game have some sense of false hope. I knew what was coming and I still kept hoping they’d change it somehow.
Hostages,This show makes my heart ache. I start to feel like questioning who or what I would be like in their shoes. Really well filmed and the characters feel complete even with their short one episode involvement. I was really hoping her blood was gonna save him. 😭
Hostages,Knew what was coming and still wasn’t prepared. I was on an emotional high of seeing the sniper scene with Joel and that awesome bloater
Hostages,"wow the absolute dread I had the entire episode knowing it was coming only to still sob for the last 5 minutes.  


Perfect."
Hostages,"Absolutely loved the episode never having played the games. 

On a note unrelated to the acting, the “most shots miss” troupe comically went out the window once Joel had to pop heads right next to Ellie. I’m more than happy to sweep it under the suspension of disbelief rug though, that scene felt lifted right out of a video game (in a good way)"
Hostages,Wait am I missing something? Did I miss a week? I just watched episode 4 earlier last week. When was 5 released?
Hostages,"The subtle shaking after from Lamar after what happened, incredible."
Hostages,"Amazing episode! I’m totally enthralled with this series. 

I feel like they are doing a great job blending the game with their own ideas, outside the Tess scene."
Hostages,This show is way too good at making me love characters that get killed by the end of the episode
Hostages,"I legitimately had to walk away and collect myself after that ending. No show has done that to me before. Ned Stark, the Red Wedding, Hank & Gomie, etc. were all amazing and left me shocked. Especially Hank. But nothing made me walk away just feeling something like Henry's emotions during that scene. 

Like I knew either Sam or Henry were bit during the car scene. It seemed really obvious with how they were kicking. But that didn't change the emotional impact of Henry having to put his brother down (and really not hesitating) and then ending his own life.

I've wanted to play the games for years but held off because I thought they were more cinematic than ""games."" I'm glad I waited though. I don't know if I would feel the same way about the massive emotional moments in this show. 

I know one spoiler about the games. I really don't think they'll do it (I hope not) but that one will really fuck with people."
Hostages,They had remarkable performances! This show is so so good.
Hostages,"That shot of Ellie >!looking down at Sam after he killed himself, just shocked with tears streaming down her face!<…Emmy for Bella Ramsey. NOW."
Hostages,That was a devastatingly good episode. This show just keeps getting better.
Hostages,"NGL, needed a few tissues for this episode."
Hostages,Can't read that yet.
Hostages,"They both did fantastic!  From beginning to end you’re rooting for them but given the context of the story, you kind of know how it’s going to end for them.  This show is so epic in terms of the writing and acting."
Hostages,He deserves an Emmy
Hostages,Such a great show
Hostages,I really appreciated the nuance. It’s this weird ground where I hate Henry. Rats are the worst. Especially in a global pandemic. But I was still able to understand why they did it.
Hostages,I knew it was coming and it still completely floored me. Honestly it's a good thing this is a weekly show because if I was bingeing it and watched Episode 3 and Episode 5 in the same night I would probably have to take a long break haha.
Hostages,Such a good episode! This show has been so much better than I expected.
Hostages,So I haven’t played the game and have no clue what the storyline is but my god has my heart been ripped out about a million times watching this series
Hostages,Epic episode
Hostages,"NGL, needed a few tissues for this episode."
Hostages,"NGL, needed a few tissues for this episode."
Hostages,"Wish there weren't titles like this. You can already assume what's going to happen from it.

Usually I don't care but a lot of people will forget that the new episode released today instead of Sunday."
Hostages,Who would follow a crazy killing off the last people alive like Katherine?
Hostages,[deleted]
Hostages,[deleted]
Hostages,Sheds light on americas black on black crime! We killing our brothers!
Hostages,Who would follow a crazy killing off the last people alive like Katherine?
Hostages,No thanks.
Hostages,Yeah they said it would’ve taken too long to make. Guess it was just easier and faster to use real people.
Hostages,I didn't play the game. What the FUCK.
Hostages,It’s been amazing. I never played the games and I’m so glad I didn’t. I really hope I can make it through this show without seeing game spoilers.
Hostages,I played the game and my wife didn’t. We have watched every episode together. She gets to experience it for the first time while I watch stoically and not answering her questions. I get to experience PTSD
Hostages,"As someone who didn’t, I can confirm; I felt out of breath as the credits hit. Just sat there stunned. What an episode of television, my god."
Hostages,As someone obsessed with the game for years I’ve been driving over to watch each episode with my dad who I love deeply but has absolutely no patience for video games. It’s been really fun to watch him get invested in this show. Tonight he was doing anxiety paces that I usually only see him do during the last two minutes of a close Kentucky basketball game. after >!Henry killed himself!< I saw him wiping away tears. It’s really interesting to see him experiencing the story and really getting into it. It’s everything I could’ve hoped for.
Hostages,I knew it was coming and it still messed me up. Very well done
Hostages,"I haven't, after a point I switched away from playstation *for the bois*. After episode 3 though there's no holds barred, I know I'm going to be a mess every episode. HBO really smashing it out of the park even for those of us who haven't played."
Hostages,I sort-of forgot...was sort-of hoping that Ellie could be the hero. I guess I fucked up
Hostages,"I think the show is still very captivating even for those who played the game. On the parts that they deviate, I’m very curious as to what the changes are. On the parts where it follows the game, I’m more interested in the nuance of the performances and portrayals of the actors. 

The show has done a great job of bringing just enough of a twist to the story and portrayals that even though I’m familiar with the storyline, it still catches my interest the whole time."
Hostages,Dude it's been hitting harder knowing what is coming.
Hostages,"My Dad was super shocked when Henry shot himself, he was really hoping they'd come with Joel. Watching his reaction was just as entertaining as the show"
Hostages,"I played the game but only once right after it came out.

I remember basically nothing but a giraffe. And I remember a choice Joel makes later.

Also when he slowly moved a bookshelf out of the way I thought ""yea that seems familiar."""
Hostages,"I’m super happy I don’t know what’s going to happen each episode, but it also makes me want to play the game"
Hostages,I think the game is marginally better way to experience the story. Just stinks you cant go in blind twice
Hostages,I played it a long time ago so it even caught me off guard
Hostages,"I played the game but it was yeeeeacrs ago and I'm so glad I forgot many of the side stories. Heck, I didn't even remember these characters were in the game, let alone how they died. What an emotional amazing episode!"
Hostages,I played the game and knew what was coming and it still got me.  Fuck.
Hostages,I didn't play the game. Saw it coming a mile away. But it was still had a heavy impact. My wife didn't. She was shook. Then I told her... Think about all the people back in the city. That was their entire security force that just got wiped out. The entire city dead in order to give give a kid a few more months/years of life. She cried. I randomly cursed for the next hour.
Hostages,I played it so long ago that I kind of remember characters but not major plot points. It came flooding back though.
Descendants of the Sun,[deleted]
Descendants of the Sun,Awesome! Thanks for the link!
Descendants of the Sun,I miss Alice. It's a pity they couldn't get her back for this.
Descendants of the Sun,"Season 1 was good, season 2 was mostly passable, but seasons 3 and 4 were corny cliche-ridden rubbish IMHO. Hope it recovers with this movie."
Descendants of the Sun,"kind of unrelated but Idris Elba produces EDM on the side and he actually has some BOPS

I love body shot"
Descendants of the Sun,"Hmm, how to leave a useful remark, without any kind of spoiler? Here goes...the writing of The Fallen Sun is as if a mis-matched team of adolescents thought it would be funny to take the post-it's they'd written of every half-remembered superhero pic and lotto-ball-bowl them—it is that coherent - sheesh. The first three decisions Luther makes or are made against him, as so wildly out of character, I had to stop the stream to check that I wasn't watching a parody. The pacing of the story build/development is as if they just raced to check every box 'yes'; yes,  we've covered a, b, c, etc. Illogical, nonsensical, VERY different vibe from 'Luther'. Whiplash inducing. If you like the Luther series - skip this."
Descendants of the Sun,"Saw this in theatres. Absolutely loved it. It was a dark pulsating crime thriller with a great lead and a compelling villain. They don't make movies like this anymore. It wasn't exactly Fincher but the tone reminded me off Girl with the golden with the dragon tattoo.

If you can see it on the big screen, you should. Its miles better than the mediocre Marvel DC movies that are the standard these days"
Descendants of the Sun,"The show never recovered after the first 2 seasons, don't know if I want to come back."
Descendants of the Sun,Perfectly cromulent.
Descendants of the Sun,"Can't wait to see this.

> released on Netflix

Oh, for fuck sake."
Descendants of the Sun,Police are portrayed as useless.
Descendants of the Sun,Stupid! Too many scenes were beyond pathetic and unrealistic. We couldn’t finish it! The writers were horrible.. Come on Idris you are better than this!!
Descendants of the Sun,Went to shit after season 2
Descendants of the Sun,"The movie was horrible.  so predictable, horrible acting/script.  I'm so disappointed as I was really looking forward to it.  I know it was BBC, but it seems like almost every Netflix movie is a dud lately."
Descendants of the Sun,You might want to finish the last episode of season five…
Descendants of the Sun,Oh... Well at least I know this beforehand now.
Descendants of the Sun,Great Villain and a great actress.
Descendants of the Sun,"No duck face flapping all over the screen?  Couldn't have asked for a better denouement to Luther's story.  This makes me retrospectively like her even more as a character since now I know that the writers didn't wear out her welcome like a bad penny.

I'll refresh my memory on season 1 before I pick up and start season 2 blind."
Descendants of the Sun,Can you just give us a rundown?
Descendants of the Sun,"Can anyone else chime in with their opinions on this? I've never watched Luther but I like Elba. I'm wondering if I watch it, whether there's a point where I'm better off stopping."
Descendants of the Sun,"I really enjoyed season 2, but the death of a certain character in that one really spelled the death of the show imo. It just wasn’t the same afterwards."
Descendants of the Sun,"and he's not bad. Driss the Londoner was his nom de plume in clubs, not sure if he still uses it"
Descendants of the Sun,"First comment I’ve actually agreed with, this film was so jarring it felt like one of those screen plays written by an AI, absolute shit do not watch this film"
Descendants of the Sun,"Tamer, less gritty than Fincher. It was an ok film with some great moments"
Descendants of the Sun,It's in theaters too.
Descendants of the Sun,Because they generally are
Descendants of the Sun,"There was an interview recently where they heavily hinted at bringing her back in a sequel, so I would say that scene was as ambiguous as it was supposed to be."
Descendants of the Sun,You might want to watch the last episode before you watch this
Descendants of the Sun,Sure thing Charles
Descendants of the Sun,"Do you like police dramas with ever-more-ridiculous criminals? Do you like like individual detectives squaring off against masterminds that somehow entrap and kill entire SWAT teams, yet stop to taunt the detective? If yes, you’re going to fucking LOVE Luther. 

And I don’t mean this ironically. I enjoyed all seasons."
Descendants of the Sun,"It's a police procedural set in a world that's intentionally a bit comic booky.

The character of Luther is not a good man. He has a strict absolute view on what is right and what is wrong. He is right, so anyone in his way is wrong. And anything he does to stop the villains in his life is right. Even if that's someone who isn't actually doing anything wrong.

The bad guys of the week aren't just normal detective show killers, to match Luther's self perception of himself as a hero, they're proper villains, typically quite cartoonish. 

The show presents itself as quite grounded but it doesn't take long before it shows its true colours, and it rubs a lot of people the wrong way if they went in expecting something different. 

It's a show that is more interested in being entertaining that realistic. 

The other aspect is a character that is introduced in the first episode called Alice, who is a fan favourite and an agent of chaos whenever she's on screen. She is not around for the whole show, so a lot of people perceive a drop in quality when she is not in a series.

In general it is a fun show to watch, with a unique approach to the genre, but it is a bit rocky at times. The good thing is that there really aren't many episodes, so it's an easy watch. The longest series was series 1 with 6 episodes."
Descendants of the Sun,"I'm the same person from above, but it's a British show with typically British very short seasons, so it's not a huge time investment. Season 1 is only 6 episodes and that's the longest one. Season 2 is only 4 episodes. It's a steady progression downwards in quality IMHO, so if you find season 2 bad, you should probably stop there. I didn't learn my lesson until later, but unlike a show like Heroes\*, the time investment wasn't so enormous that I felt like I wanted a receipt at the end so I could collect those hours back at the end of my life and use them to watch grass grow or paint dry instead.

*\*Obligatory disclaimer that the writers' strike supposedly ruining Heroes is a viral internet myth. It is misinformation. The show was ruined because the writers were idiots; also note that the strike was between seasons 2 and 3, not between 1 and 2. Spread the word in every Heroes thread.*"
Descendants of the Sun,"Nah just watch it all, season 3 is good, 4 is a step down but then 5 is better and this is apparently goodish"
Descendants of the Sun,It's a [Batman show without Batman](https://www.escapistmagazine.com/luther-is-a-batman-show-without-batman/)
Descendants of the Sun,"A lot of Luther is elevated by Elba’s performance, if you like him you’ll definitely enjoy it. Though earlier seasons are definitely stronger as the later seasons become burdened with trying to keep raising the stakes. Similar to Craig’s bond films, your suspension of disbelief gets called on more as the series progresses"
Descendants of the Sun,"Yeah, good take...perhaps it felt so jarring because Sydney/Bing was hallucinating - heh, also, your comment helped me clarify what I actually felt slogging through the parts I did watch - annoyed. It was NOT Luther."
Descendants of the Sun,"You're right, I never did finish it actually. Might as well start from the beginning before watching the movie. Thanks for the heads up."
Descendants of the Sun,"I suppose it depends on how plausible we're talking. Are they well written villains? Is there a valid reason why they're able to do what they do? Or are we talking ""Sherlock season 3"" here?"
Descendants of the Sun,"Those final two sentences really threw me for a loop, but points for internet comment originality. I am forced to like this comment.

I guess being a big fan of shows like Homicide: Life on the Street kinda disqualifies me from understanding the appeal of a show like this (unless Ruth Wilson is there to chew the scenery, I'll watch her in almost anything)."
Descendants of the Sun,"5 is mostly trash but it’s still watchable because alice is in it. 

Once Luther leaves the force it became a very different show tbh and the whole police doing it by the book vs Luther’s methods is pushed to the background. Will be checking this out to see how they handle it."
Descendants of the Sun,"Ffs just watch a couple episodes and make your own mind up. You say you're an Idris Elba fan, yet you haven't seen arguably his most prominent role?"
Descendants of the Sun,"More Season One (consistently), if Sherlock was a normal detective. In addition, no character (other than Luther himself) has plot armour."
Descendants of the Sun,"Enjoying an actor's work doesn't mean that I immediately run out and watch everything that they've ever been in. Considering the amount of high quality TV that's out there, I also prefer to know whether a show goes in the toilet at some point so I know when to stop watching. Do you also recommend that people watch every single episode of Heroes or The Walking Dead? 

But no, God forbid that we should try to discuss television in a television discussion forum. Why do we even have this review posted here anyway? Everyone should have to watch every single piece of entertainment for themselves to find out whether it's any good or not."
Descendants of the Sun,"There's like 12 episodes of Luther lol if you're curious watch it, if not don't."
Descendants of the Sun,"I don’t really care either way, but it’s really bizarre that Joel and Ellie come across, I think, 0 infected after KC."
Descendants of the Sun,They didn't need tons of infected just a spattering like when Ellie meets David. I feel like that whole interaction would have been better if there was some infected so it's more of a trusting moment for her like in the game
Descendants of the Sun,[removed]
Descendants of the Sun,[removed]
Descendants of the Sun," I missed Ellie fighting infected with David. It made more sense in the game that he wanted to “partner” with her after seeing how useful she was. In the show it felt like we skipped a beat and his fascination with her felt less earned.

The other action sequence I missed was the fight/escape at the university. It didn’t need to be as big as in the game and Joel could still get stabbed by a bat but I missed the suspense of Joel hobbling out as Ellie has to be the protector for the first time. Felt rushed in the show."
Descendants of the Sun,They got it backwards. Infected are way more critical to the first story than the second.
Descendants of the Sun,"I get where they are coming from but I think they overcorrected to the point where you're questioning why a vaccine is needed.

The series is probably 1-2 episodes light."
Descendants of the Sun,The real issue is it only being 9 episodes. 2 of those episodes were back stories and the rest had to also build up other characters.
Descendants of the Sun,"I do think there should have been more. The story is of course about the characters, and their relationships... But the infected felt completely shunted to the side in the second half of the story. Joel and Ellie run into, what, 1 after Sam? There are opportunities to make them more influential. You don't have to cut every single action sequence."
Descendants of the Sun,"It's so weird that people see this argument as binary.

Either ""the story isn't about the infected! it's about J and E and their relationship! more would ruin it!"" or ""there was no infected at all! total lack of action! so boring!""

There's a fucking middle ground, people. They could totally have added *some* more infected without killing the story, without making people bored of the violence. No one is asking for 30 minutes of non-stop infected killing every episode. No one wants TWD again. But yes, a *little* more of infected would have been great, and I look forward to a *little* more of them in season 2."
Descendants of the Sun,"I definitely think 9 episodes was way too short, and am surprised that they didn’t at least go to say, 12 episodes, to flesh out some of the conflicts and characters. But, maybe that’s all that was greenlit and now they are going to get way more leeway to stretch things out and give some storylines some air. Here’s hoping at least."
Descendants of the Sun,It did feel like they stripped a little too much from the game
Descendants of the Sun,Rat King is coming
Descendants of the Sun,"There were two weird uses of the Infected. 1) that the world wide cordyceps web never came back beyond the episode it was referenced in feels like a miss, and 2) the Tress death kiss is still super weird

Other than that, I don’t think it was over or under done. There was a whole scene where the earth opened and a Belcher showed up"
Descendants of the Sun,Translation: “The Last of Us” will have a shitload more money in the budget for effects.
Descendants of the Sun,Balance fixes for next patch. Nice!
Descendants of the Sun,Epic series. They need to turn it into a video game.
Descendants of the Sun,"It was a serious flaw for me. The story starts on top of a serious,cataclysmic threat and sticks to it for 2 episodes. We see infected again once after that. It's a great story but they travel around freely never having to deal with infected again. Ellie's importance fades. I watched the middle episodes thinking ""oh shit!! they're going to have to enter the buildings"" but no infected anywhere. They have to use the tunnels, no infected, they travel through forests, no infected. They travel to a university then to an empty town and enter a home with no infected anywhere again. The last batch of episodes I basically told myself the infected aren't a danger I guess. I dont see it as a necessity to have the story we got. It's still top tier TV but the show kinda shifts into a generic post apocalypse rather than the world it started off as. Games need high numbers of encounters to keep engagement but this goes hard the opposite direction."
Descendants of the Sun,"Its weird. The show has really driven home to me how little the infected actually have to do with the plot, but still their absence makes them feel like less a part of traversing the world. I didn’t mind them not being around much, I expected it, but it almost seems backwards to commit to more of them in season 2 by when there’ll be Scars and the WLF to represent now as well."
Descendants of the Sun,"For me, without infected the relationship between Joel and Ellie fell a little flat because their bond felt somewhat unearned. In the game they are pushed to the limits and that experience makes their bond so much stronger. So maybe an episode or two were missing with more action between them and infected."
Descendants of the Sun,It's a good show but it just feels like blander more watered down version of the game. The show is just missing that constant tension and feeling that anything could happen at any time.
Descendants of the Sun,"The show is probably one of the greatest game adaptations ever. It's amazing how similar they kept a lot of set pieces and dialog. Amazing work.

However, as a show, it's really not that compelling and very boring. You miss out on a lot of key moments and growth between characters because the story moves at a quick pace. The episode where Ellie meets David would have been much better if they included them fighting the infected together. Stuff like that is missing greatly."
Descendants of the Sun,They are blazing through the story and skipping all the big action sequences.
Descendants of the Sun,"I mostly enjoyed the show but I would say pacing and choosing which storylines to focus on more, was the biggest issue of season 1. Also the finale was a bit short and disappointing, ngl"
Descendants of the Sun,"This show has been so strange to me! I loved Last of Us the game... and I love the show... but it feels like they should have had 3 more episodes. The story beats were there but it felt kind of forced, the father/daughter relationship between Joel and Ellie. Like we didn't get enough time with them to develop that relationship in the show with all the side stories (episode 3 is an absolute masterpiece in storytelling). I haven't watched the final episode yet but I dunno... 12 episodes would have been great."
Descendants of the Sun,[removed]
Descendants of the Sun,The lack of action started in episode 3
Descendants of the Sun,The monkey paw curls and turns S2 into one of the Resident Evil movies.
Descendants of the Sun,When I hear a great show is making changes to address fans' concerns I just assume it's about to get significantly worse and so far I've been right every time
Descendants of the Sun,"How will all the defenders constantly screaming ""its not about infected! Duh!"" be able to say that after every episode now?!"
Descendants of the Sun,With how little the infected were shown I almost forgot they existed.
Descendants of the Sun,"Too late, you already skipped all the good stuff"
Descendants of the Sun,Season 1 treated the game as if it were a walking simulator. It was such a bizarre choice.
Descendants of the Sun,"Yeah i got bored tbh it was like- Meet new characters, they die. Repeat. 🤣"
Descendants of the Sun,My wife and I just watched ep 6 and she said she didn't like the last 2 episodes cause they have almost no action. This is a woman that closes heir eyes in every gore scene on any movie/show.
Descendants of the Sun,"It felt like an adventure of the week buddy cop show. It was fun to look into this world a little more, but as far as overarching risk within the plot it really didn’t feel like there was any…"
Descendants of the Sun,"I really did not like the infected in the finale, it highlights the problem they are trying to avoid

Because of the needs of the scene, the infected just runs up and kind of pins the person and makes noises in front of them while suspense builds

After the suspense is allowed to build for a little bit, the person somehow manages to get the thing off of them.  Usually they manage to reach a nearby weapon.

Then, even though the infected just did it's whole ""pin them and make scary noises"" routine, somehow a bite mark appears on the person's leg.  Darn, now they are infected.

/yawn"
Descendants of the Sun,The show felt incredibly hollow to me.
Descendants of the Sun,"I liked the Bill and Frank episode, and the explanations for the origin of of cordyceps and Ellie's immunity. But overall the show just wasn't as good as the game. I think it needed more time maybe idk. I wasn't quite buying the relationship, especially at the end."
Descendants of the Sun,Oh something tells me they're will be something else that will be complained about in S2
Descendants of the Sun,"I'm two minds about it.

At first I was really enjoying the fact that the zombie apocalypse in LOU was just the setting, just the catalyst for human stories. I'm not big fan of body horror and gruesome death, like you see all the time in Walking Dead. Walking Dead also seems to ask the question ""how can we have the protagonists fight more zombies?"" while LOU asks ""what adventures could the protagonists experience in a zombie-ridden world"".

What also made me double-down on this opinion were the zombie episodes of this show - the second episode and the second Kansas episode. The zombie portions were really clichéd and gamey. Seriously, in the second episode, once they entered the building you could re-construct the following story from zombie clichés. Zombies hiding in a seemingly empty building? Check. Building falling apart exactly when the protagonists enter the building? Check. Debris falling right behind the protagonists, blocking their way back? Check. Zombies resistant to bullets? Check. Hasty, nervous reloading? Check. Protagonist trying to be silent and stepping on something loud? Check. One of the protagonists getting bitten but hiding this fact? Check... And the the body horror / zombie kiss that was made just to shock the audience...

And the zombie portion of the second Kansas episode was kinda short to be full of clichés, but it felt like a video game. A boss fight while Joel is suddenly a perfect sniper (after missing the truck several times a few minutes earlier)? C'mon, that was outright lazy. All in all, I find the zombie bits of the show to be the worse parts (with the exception of the mall episode, which was really boring and dragged-out).

But that being said, the show sometimes goes too far and forgets about the zombies completely. I don't want more zombie fights (especially given how sub-par this show handles them), but I want more reminders that this is a zombie apocalypse. We have had many sight of ruined, destroyed and desolate world... but almost every time without zombies. As a big Fallout fan my default impression from these sights and stories is that it's an aftermath of some war. Why couldn't they show some zombies walking around there?

Big offenders in this regard were the 8th and 6th episodes. Both were completely lacking any zombies and 8th episode didn't even mention them. Don't get me wrong, both were probable the best episodes in this show, but they could have been part of ANY post-apocalyptic show. Seriously, in episode 8 I completely forgot about the zombies until Ellie started screaming ""I'm infected"" in the climax... and I remembered that zombies are actually a thing in this universe. In was kinda jarring.

That is probably mi biggest criticism of the show. It has some great production value, great stories and great characters... but it doesn't build the world particularly well and the main narrative is disjointed. Like, twice in 9 episodes we jumped to a flashback for 90% of the episode. First flashback was a great story, but did nothing for the overarching narrative. The second flashback served to enhance Ellie's backstory... but it was boring as hell. And the whole narrative and the worldbuilding seems to be undecisive about how important and threatening are the zombies."
Descendants of the Sun,Im not sure those that havent played the game will be ready for the season two though. It will be quite a big departure from season one. Im more interested whether they will announce TLOU3 soon after this as the source material had finished.
Descendants of the Sun,"It’s not lack of action, just lack of actual zombies. The show is good, it got me hooked. But there is a lack of zombies."
Descendants of the Sun,Hopefully it does. I loved both games and the show but the lack of infected was just a bad idea. They are the *reason* the world is in the state it's in. There didn't need to be walking dead level of monsters but God damn there needed to be alot more than we got
Descendants of the Sun,"Honestly, i thought they sprinkled in action well enough. I really don’t care for excessive gun shots and screaming. Would’ve likes the bloater to be more of a problem than it was.

Hopefully they do the Rat King well."
Descendants of the Sun,Is anyone gonna care about infected when we get round 2 of everyone being pissed off by *you know what*?
Descendants of the Sun,I don’t know maybe it’s because I  didn’t play the video games but I didn’t have a lot of the issues that people in this thread have 🤷🏾‍♂️. Are there parts I thought could have been done better? Certainly but I could say that about any show that I’ve watched. I don’t think this is #1 greatest show of all time or anything like that but that’s a huge weight to put on any show especially one in its first season. Right now I think it’s pretty great with potential to get better adaption purists be damned.
Descendants of the Sun,"The truth is episode 3 needed to be cut and that 1 hr 20 mins of time desperately was needed in other places, including Joel and Ellie having more encounters with infected.

Episode 3 is great tv don’t get me wrong it’s just very irrelevant to the story being told which becomes a problem when we run out of episodes telling that story"
Descendants of the Sun,"I'm sitting here shouting to them not to listen to the criticism like Cooper in the tesseract in Interstellar.

I worry they'll over-correct. 

In the show, these things are so damn dangerous that if they show fights with them more than a few times a season, it will quickly feel like TWD where there are no stakes whatsoever and the zombies can be dispatched with such ease that you wonder why society ever fell. 

So I'd rather have too few than too many. Personally."
Descendants of the Sun,"I, for one, have thoroughly enjoyed the overarching threat of infected with a lack of their constant appearance. The same goes for the need to show gore. How they showed Ellie >!killing David!<…Hitchcock would’ve been proud."
Descendants of the Sun,[deleted]
Descendants of the Sun,"When the whole hubbub came out of episode 3, as one of ""the greatest episode in television history"", in the grand scheme for overall series progression and impact to the story of Ellie and Joel, in my opinion it was a wasted episode that could have been dedicated to more infected action, tension, or mcguffin chasing."
Descendants of the Sun,The real monsters were the uninfected.
Descendants of the Sun,"Not what I expected going in. Not my thing, I expected way more action. I’m assuming most people who liked it didn’t play the game."
Descendants of the Sun,"I believe no spores and lack of infected hugely decreased the gravity of the situation. 

We see pockets of people living in gated communities and surviving. They die of starvation, lack of medicine, raids etc. rather than the infected. So why would we need a vaccine? Just don't venture to deep or beyond.

I mean it doesn't have to be action scenes. Seeing infected and changing their road, seeing other people getting killed could have been enough ro remind us what's at stake."
Descendants of the Sun,"That’s super disappointing fr.  The show is so awesome bc it is the story of the people in this crazy situation, less to do with the situation itself.  Making it all about the infected seems like it’ll ruin why the show is so great"
Offspring,Sounds interesting. Looking forward to hear more about it.
Offspring,"I recently got TV+ for free, so here's a semi related question: Is that UI when using a browser a joke? 

Can't search for anything (not that there's enough to warrant a search function). Can't bookmark anything. Why even bother Apple?"
Offspring,"Star Trek is my go-to when I can't sleep at night.  I've seen them all a dozen times, it's generally very low key and calm, and it never gets old.  I cycle between Next Gen, DS9, and Voyager but Next Gen will always be my favorite."
Offspring,"Watch ""Darmok"" twice. The first time, the aliens are all shouting gibberish at each other before Picard is beamed down.

But on a second watch, you understand exactly what's being said.

Some of the best writing ever."
Offspring,"[The Drumhead](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=smdqe2eluEI), [Who Watches the Watchers](https://youtu.be/n6NPq_kPSUM?t=8), Inner Light, [Chain of Command](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moX3z2RJAV8), Lower Decks, that one where Wesley tries to cover for a failed prohibited exhibition maneuver - [The First Duty](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xefh7W1nVo4), [video game addiction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is12anYx2Qs), [Moriarty](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLFbC6CeRuw), Times Arrow, Yesterday's Enterprise, The Chase.   
   
The entire series is fantastic as long as it's not an Alexander episode.
   
If you have not watched DS9 you're in for a treat."
Offspring,[deleted]
Offspring,"What was the one where captain Picard got zapped by a probe and lived a whole life on a planet that was dying and got married and had children.  He even learnt to play the flute. Man, I loved that episode and it stuck with me even after all these years.  I think the original Stargate did a similar episode where Magiver got old."
Offspring,There are FOUR lights.
Offspring,"And now you understand ""Shaka, when the walls fell."""
Offspring,"The Inner Light still randomly pops into my head and I have to watch it again.  Same thing with Chain of Command....***""THERE ARE FOUR LIGHTS!!!""***"
Offspring,"""Your honor, a courtroom is a crucible. In it we burn away irrelevancies  until we are left with a pure product - the truth, for all time. ""

\-Picard, Ep: measure of a man

Get chills everytime I hear it."
Offspring,I always liked the episodes where Captain Picard fell in love.
Offspring,"Earlier in COVID times I rewatched TNG based on this article, on the recommendation of a friend: 

""Star Trek: The Next Generation In 40 Hours | by Max Temkin | Maxistentialism Blog | Medium"" https://medium.com/maxistentialism-blog/star-trek-the-next-generation-in-40-hours-c4a6762cbd3

TNG was the Star Trek of my youth (old millennial) and I was surprised by how well it held up,what I did and did not remember."
Offspring,I never watched any of the Star Trek tv shows before but have enjoyed watching The Orville. Is TNG the best Star Trek for the modern viewer to watch first?
Offspring,"Star Trek when it used to be a moral universe you'd dream of living in...
Red Letter Media have done a couple of top 5 TNG episodes which are well worth watching. Those guys don't take themselves seriously but dang do they know their stuff and respect the audience."
Offspring,"TNG is probably the one TV show that influenced me the most growing up. ""You can do everything right and still lose,"" comes to mind often these days. Picard may not have been a fan of kids, but I was a fan of him, lol.

Seeing people gush about the show online gives me warm fuzzies. I should go rewatch it."
Offspring,"Do DS9 next. You will not be disappointed.  I love TNG, but DS9 is my favorite of the series."
Offspring,"Can anyone imagine this being said about Discovery, or the Picard show?  God Star Trek needs to be taken away from CBS."
Offspring,And I thought Bing was only good for porn.
Offspring,"I am in season 6 now and cannot believe how long I slept on this. 

I liked Star Wars. Always thought I hated Star Trek. No. Just didn’t know enough about it.

Star Trek: Next Generation was so incredibly ahead of it’s time in subject matter. They bring up conversations that we are having for real today regarding gender, AI, Ethics of many types. 

Incredible acting among some of the characters (some pretty poor, campy acting as well). But altogether a fantastic show for it’s time period that remains relevant today."
Offspring,Darmok and Jalad at Tanagra!
Offspring,"I also had never watched this before earlier this year! Found myself in love with this series as well. Some episodes better than others. I love all they ways they use Data to take on different 'human' issues. And let's faces it, the women of the enterprise are babes😍😍😍"
Offspring,"I still remember the day it ended and they counted down some top episodes before airing the finale.  Which personally, is one of the best show endings around.  It hit all the fan-favorite themes of the series, incorporated DeLancie, had a genuinely interesting mystery and wrapped up in a satisfying way.

Don't forget the movies.  There's a bit of a mixed bag, First Contact is popularly considered the best."
Offspring,"Then try Babylon 5 - initially it was suggested as Star Trek series, then it was made on it's own. Very good, although takes a season to get going similar to TNG finding it's footing at the beginning.

upd. Will be streamed on HBO Max from January 26. Pilot is poorly shot, first season is where the show finds it's footing, I suggest powering through, there are a lot of set ups there. Has a planned story as opposed to usual 1 season arcs."
Offspring,"You are probably at the beginning of watching a lot of Star Trek. If you get done with that and still want more long running scifi TV shows, check out Stargate SG-1 and its spinoffs. SG-1 is I think still the longest running American scifi show with well over 200 episodes. Like Star Trek TNG, its success led to a number of movies, spinoffs, games, books, etc. It is significantly different than Star Trek in a lot of ways, but it has that same feel of a scientific exploration procedural that visits tons of alien worlds... A suspicious number of which look like ancient Greece or medieval England."
Offspring,"Been going through it again on Netflix recently. Just passed The Inner Light and Time's Arrow, which are two of my favorites. I still consider myself a fan of Trek even though most of the new stuff since TNG & DS9 hasn't really interested me (only newer Trek I've watched all the way through is Picard which wasn't really *Trek* to me, but not terrible).

To me, Trek was best as stand alone, self-contained episodes. I know lots of people disagree, but I loved just getting new places and people to explore every week (which is part of the reason DS9 wasn't as satisfying to me as TNG... too static). 

I understand the appeal of longer arcs and deeper character development. I watch tons of shows that do this well. But TNG packed a lot of excitement and thought provoking moments without the baggage of remembering what came before. It was bite sized adventures and, to me, that's what made Trek what it was. Outside the first couple seasons where it's rough, and some of those later eps that are quite ""meh"" if not downright terrible (Shades of Gray, I'm looking at you), TNG is some of the best TV from that era."
Offspring,"Now, go watch deep Space 9! It's a bit slow to start, but has a great character build up and plot. Watch Voyager afterwards."
Offspring,Go on YouTube and there is montages of how Riker sits down.  Or ones where everyone tells Wesley to shut up.
Offspring,"I really wish we had a show like TNG today. What I like in Star Trek is when it shows us the best of humanity, when it inspires us to improving mankind, when it's food for thoughts. I'm not aware of a recent series that can do this."
Offspring,Pity about the recent Picard series ;/
Offspring,"I just did this recently and I’ve always enjoyed TNG, especially as a kid but but even more so now as an adult. Its not perfect of course but it really is a great show to sit back and watch. My TNG binge sessions also made me realize how much I generally enjoy shows that take place in outer space."
Offspring,"My favorite episode would either be the introduction to the Borg, or "" where no man has gone before"", something like that title. The Traveler enables them to travel beyond galaxies."
Offspring,"I totally love this show. If you have a mind to I can recommend watching Red Letter Media discuss their favourite episodes. They love it and have some great insights and thoughts. I binge watched it again recently and it's still great, especially Seasons 3 and 4. Hardly any filler episodes and some true high water marks.
https://youtu.be/m-hGLHOzvgs"
Offspring,Now that you're done check out [Honest Trailers: Star Trek the Next Generation](https://youtu.be/-6Zc8Co2H3w)
Offspring,"The Inner Light is considered by a lot of us old school fans (like, I used to watch it each week when it aired) to be one of the very best episodes. Powerful and yet simple."
Offspring,Shut up Wesley
Offspring,Now watch TNG Edits on Youtube.
Offspring,"I was watching them all as they aired, and the three months between Seasons 3 and 4 were brutal. ""The Best of Both Worlds"" (Part 1 & 2) weren't my favorite episodes, but the cliffhanger was all we talked about that summer."
Offspring,[removed]
Offspring,“Measure of a Man” is my absolute favorite episode. Both Picard and Riker’s passion during the trial was awesome. And the ending scene between Data and Riker is a tear jerker.
Offspring,"My man glad you enjoyed! Random quote for you ""THE HIGHER THE FEWER"""
Offspring,Now watch DS9
Offspring,I watched Star Trek: Enterprise recently and loved it. Can recommend
Offspring,"""It is possible to commit no mistakes and still lose. That is not a weakness, that is life.""   
-Captain Jean-Luc Picard

TNG is one of the best TV series ever in more ways than one. I literally got through a very dark period of my life because of that show."
Offspring,"If you want something with a more modern style but the same themes, watch the Orville. While it's a Seth MacFarlane project, it's actually a spiritual successor to Trek at its best. It has big sci-fi ideas; not just dick jokes."
Offspring,"I started the series mid-2020 and blew through the first 2 seasons, i loved it so much that i had to slow down so i can savor the series. I’m so glad i started it. It is easily one of my favorite scifis now."
Offspring,Welcome to the club. :)
Offspring,"My wife and I did that early quarantine! And man, do I miss those deep V pajamas Picard wore."
Offspring,Came here to say I am currently binge watching TNG and already cannot wait to tackle the other Star Trek series. Haven’t been this excited about a show in quite some time.
Offspring,"It’s why I haven’t enjoyed Discovery or Picard (especially this one) as much, which is being generous; they’re actually kinda bad but sometimes nice to look at. They’re missing all of the elements that make you think philosophically and just decided to go mindless action and cringe dialogue route. I’ll rewatch TNG, Voyager, DS9, and Enterprise any day."
Offspring,"I'm eternally grateful to TNG. My parents divorced in the early 90's, and one of my escapes from all of that was that show. My friends and I were all about Star Trek generally, but TNG was the star of our worlds. 

I would record it on a betamax I had in my room and watch each episode repeatedly. 

Fast forward a few decades, and I still put TNG on when I am having troubles sleeping. I can close my eyes, listen to the dialog, and get lost in that universe, and it's so very comforting for me. 

It's also just a fantastically progressive show, and it's neat to watch it all again now to appreciate the cultural context of some of those episodes and how they really pressed the edges at times."
Offspring,"TNG is one of my favorite series of all time.

If you haven't already, try Orville. It's a fantastically funny take on some very similar ideas."
Offspring,Highly recommend binging Stargate SG1 next. Top tier Sci-Fi as well
Offspring,"Clues - very underrated, imo.  Tapestry is also excellent."
Offspring,"Yes, if I could live in any universe, it would be on the Enterprise-D."
Offspring,"I am 40 and female , and my father made me watch all of these with him growing up, and I am a sincere fan!"
Offspring,I think this is the series that my husband said we should watch while we were watching The Orville this week. He said The Orville is reminiscent of Next Generation and that we should watch it together (I’ve never watched any Star Trek tv series)
Offspring,"Go to YT and check some of the blooper reels from TNG, it's hilarious. You start to wonder how they ever managed to get one scene recorded during a day of shooting"
Offspring,it was the best humanity education a child could get.
Offspring,"Here are three videos of two old nerds talking about their top TNG episodes. It's RedLetterMedia, if you know who that is. Just good nerd talk.

[Part 1](https://youtu.be/m-hGLHOzvgs)

[Part 2, 1 of 2](https://youtu.be/jlUyVq5RmaI)

[Part 2, 2 of 2](https://youtu.be/yAlnLnxeIOI)"
Offspring,"I loved next gen.  But for some reason I enjoyed Deep Space Nine more.  I enjoyed the darker story, characters, and not focusing on space travel.  Both shows are good."
Offspring,"I recently did the same having not liked it as a child, i can say i loved it now and will probably run through it again!"
Offspring,It's depressing to think about what Star Trek looks like today.
Offspring,[deleted]
Offspring,"I'm about half way through season 3 myself.  I still tell my wife ""You are smart.  You can make it go"" whenever something breaks around the house.

Be sure to watch the movie First Contact if you haven't already.  All the Next Gen movies are good, to varying degrees, but First Contact is something special."
Offspring,Lower your expectations for Discovery. By about warp factor 7.
Offspring,"I’m on Voyager right now, it takes part a few years or maybe even a decade after TNG. It’s pretty good, Janeway and Belana suck though."
Offspring,"I am doing the same currently in season 4. Actually I am going through all the series so far completed voyager, enterprise, caught up on Picard, discovery, and below decks. The plan after finishing TNG is to do DS9 followed TOS."
Offspring,"I also watched it based off the mentions and videos on Red Letter Media. I never had any interest in Star Trek before because of the negative perception I had of Trekkies. Now that I am older and don’t care as much about what people think of me, I just embraced it’s nerdiness and ended up loving it!"
Offspring,There's a lot of really good classic Star Trek to watch now. Most of it doesn't shine as brigtly as TNG but DS:9 (Deep Space 9) is a close second. Voyager has a lot of great episodes and characters. I love Enterprise and think it gets too harshly criticised.
Offspring,Go watch Voyager then. Absolutely loved it. Especially the doctor is such an amazing character. His special episodes were the best
Offspring,"Congrats. What was your favorite episode? Mine is ""Where No One Has Gone Before""."
Offspring,"I enjoyed all of the Star Trek series. My favorite is Voyager TBH but start that after you’re into DS9 a bit. And TOS is good but I would go into it with an open mind of the time in which it was produced. Enterprise was pretty good about explaining things from previous shows and would be a good series if you’re a fan, but not necessarily a stand alone show. I haven’t seen the new series on CBS yet but I actually did start watching Picard yesterday and so far I think it’s fantastic."
Offspring,Watch Red-letter media's two different episodes of Mike and Rich going through their favorite episodes. So worth it. It's on YouTube.
Offspring,Did you like the episode where there were 5 lights?
Offspring,THERE ARE FOUR LIGHTS!
Offspring,It was my favorite show for a while when i was a teenager until it ended.  I also returned to it the year after I got separated from my wife and it really helped me through the worst time of my life.  Even though the main characters have their individual flaws they are overall good and upstanding people who strive for more.  It was nice seeing so much purity during the darkness that was my life at that point.
Offspring,"After over 25 years of just TNG and DS9, I've started watching the orginal Trek on netflix. It's surprisingly not bad! It's Twilight Zone levels good. They also updated the special effects a few years back so that helps. If you really want more TNG or Trek in general, there's TONS of comics out there for you to read. IDW has some great stories that they've published involving TOS and TNG. There's even a comic where Picard teams up with Dr. Who! By the way, the new Lowed Decks show is hillarious and worth the watch!"
Offspring,"TNG was my introduction to Star Trek and what I grew up watching during high school. To me, it's still the epitome of what Star Trek means and the world Roddenberry created."
Offspring,"May I ask approximately how old you are? The reason I ask is that I'm in my mid 40's and I grew up watching that show *week to week on cable*! 🤯

So TNG is very sentimental to me."
Offspring,"Now check out the TNG movies, then watch Picard."
Offspring,Wait until you get to DS9
Offspring,"I’ve started to take my girlfriend through the series and it’s been a blast. She watched the original series and has never seen TNG. My favorite episode is the one after “The best of both worlds,” two parter, when Picard goes home to try and get a grip on his PTSD. Him reconnecting with his brother hits my heart every time"
Offspring,Offspring is my favorite and I've found its underappreciated by the trek community.
Offspring,That's 130 hours of TV.. It took me a few months.
Offspring,"""Measure of a Man"" has always been my favorite episode."
Offspring,"Watch DS9 , warning the firsr season is bad quality other than some really good characters. It is worth getting through for the rest."
Offspring,"This is why I hate new Trek and the Abrams movies.  Trek is meant to be about thought-experiments, morality plays, diplomacy and optimism with just a smidge of action for spice.

Not bang bang space pew pew.  Although saying that, the Scimitar battle scene in Nemesis is the best space battle on film and I will die on that hill."
Offspring,well now you have all of DS9 to get into
Offspring,Man there's something about Wesley Crusher that I just can't stand.. the show is fantastic though but I was definitely happy to see Wes go to the academy
Offspring,"My husband and I did this over the course of a free months before Christmas. He’d never seen it and I’m a big fan. It definitely still holds up and was just as engrossing to me on the N th rewatch has it was for him watching for the first time. And now we can make Star Trek TNG references to each other, which is priceless."
Offspring,The Inner Light is the greatest episode of Star Trek and I won't hear otherwise
Offspring,"I have 5 episodes left in S7, and I feel the incoming inevitable void"
Offspring,"Now that you've seen the series you should look to watch the documentary called Chaos on the Bridge.

It goes behind the scenes about the early years of TNG. Hosted by William Shatner. Very enlightening."
Offspring,Miss Chanandler Bong
Offspring,"""Drumhead"" is some Sir Patrick at his best."
Offspring,"I watched this for the first time during the early days of the pandemic. I couldn't agree more with you. ""All good things"" was such a perfect ending. Shame they had to bring Picard back."
Offspring,"Shaka, when the walls fell!"
Offspring,The 80s and 90s were great for Star Trek. It's a shame we don't have any Star Trek shows anymore.
Offspring,Wasn't aware Bing had a streaming service.
Crashing,Crashing is more raw than Fleabag  but worth watching if you want a sitcom with hot messes for characters.
Crashing,"Crashing is way more for the Lovesick/Scrotal Recall fan than it is for the Fleabag fan, though. I love all of it"
Crashing,Fleabag came out 5 months after Crashing. Fleabag would have been in pre-production when Crashing was being filmed.
Crashing,Breaking News: Artist's previous work informs their future work.
Crashing,"Crashing is hilarious and so fast paced. A very different show to Fleabag, but well worth watching."
Crashing,"I'm currently watching Fleabag for the first time. I have three episodes left. It's amazing.

Also, I only just realized the other day that we don't actually ever hear the main character's name spoken? Or did I just miss it?"
Crashing,"I honestly didn't enjoyed Crashing and I absolutely love Fleabag.

Both shows have similar tone but something about Crashing felt off."
Crashing,It took me an awfully long time before realizing that Anthony from Bridgerton was actually in Crashing. That’s where I knew him from. Realized it upon rewatching Crashing haha
Crashing,Still waiting for season 2! Need more Sam and Fred in my life
Crashing,"Crashing was a really fun show but Fleabag is just overall better. Fleabag is some of the best television you'll ever see if you're into this sort of thing, whereas Crashing is a nice funny comedy that you'll get angry about it getting canceled. Good show, but nowhere near the masterpiece that Fleabag is. And I rarely use the word ""masterpiece""."
Crashing,"I was trying to figure out who she was on Crashing.  

TIL there were two shows called Crashing that came out a year apart"
Crashing,Or bubble gum
Crashing,"Oof, is her character insufferable in Crashing, though. I did enjoy the bit where her cute hipster outfit self destructs, that was hilarious, but the rest I'm just wanting someone to slap her."
Crashing,I like Pete Holmes' Crashing way more.
Crashing,"Heh, literally started my Fleabag rewatch today. Just felt like she was tugging at the back of my brain, this fictional woman who feels so painfully real...

From the clips I've seen online, I think dlthat Crashing is at a disavantage, if you've watched FB first. Like, it screams PWB, it's really funny, but it's not her magnum opus so it can never measure up."
Crashing,I hated her and the ending Crashing.
Crashing,"I wonder if I’m the only person on earth who isn’t amazed by Fleabag. I found the writing boring and her character (and PWB herself) too annoying, even beyond the meta device of purposely making her annoying. I get that it’s subjective, and we were supposed to be challenged in relating to her, but does anyone want to make the case for why it was so incredible?"
Crashing,the French lady in Crashing is the greatest
Crashing,Great little show
Crashing,"I have a theory that Fleabag will come back in a decade or so with a season 3. There’s still so much to be told about this woman, especially at whatever new stage in her life.

Love Fleabag, such a beautiful and tragic series."
Crashing,Loved crashing. Hated fleabag
Crashing,Crashing is better than Fleabag. I said what I said!
Crashing,If you haven’t seen one or the other they are “must watches”.
Crashing,what a shitty show
Crashing,Rich white girl looks at the camera and complains life is hard
Crashing,"I like Shia LaBeouf, but she will make a better Mutt Williams"
Crashing,Crashing was so good
Crashing,"As a queer person, Fleabag season 2 resonates so much to the kind of love we have, the forbidden love trope, it is the best."
Crashing,"What is with Phoebe’s obsession of forbidden love affairs, in Crashing she wrote characters who have different iterations of forbidden love and on season 2 of Fleabag her character fell in love with a priest."
Crashing,Hot mess doesn't cover it. All of those characters are awful lol.
Crashing,"Wait, even MORE of a hotmess than the characters in Fleabag? You just piqued my interest lmao!"
Crashing,I enjoyed both but fleabag has my heart ❤️
Crashing,A much better show.
Crashing,"Raw is very polite, it's utter shite."
Crashing,I think that's a great way to categorize it.
Crashing,Lovesick is incredibly underrated.
Crashing,"I'd agree, though Scrotal Recall/Lovesick is a better show, Crashing is pretty enjoyable."
Crashing,"Agreed, love all 3, but much more like Lovesick"
Crashing,"The one-woman show that Fleabag is based on came out several year previous, so you're certainly right that Fleabag exists without Crashing in the narrowest possible definition. But presumably Waller-Bridge learned a thing or two running Crashing that she used to improve Fleabag the TV show. 

Either way, the main point is that Crashing is a worthwhile show on its own that shares many themes with Fleabag even though it might look like a generic friends group comedy on the surface."
Crashing,I stumbled on crashing on Netflix loved it. Then googled phoebe waller-bridge and found fleabag like a week after it came out. Still couldn’t get people to watch crashing even though they loved fleabag.
Crashing,You are right. Her name isn't revealed and she is actually credited as 'Fleabag' on the cast. Just another layer of humour.
Crashing,"True for a lot of the main characters. A lot of them are just credited as something like Godmother, father, priest, bus rodent..."
Crashing,"I remember when I watched it the first time, after the first episode I wasn’t sure I liked the approach. But by the end of maybe episode 3 I was totally hooked and can’t imagine it any other way. SO much cleverness in that show, and Phoebe is incredible."
Crashing,"They never say it, but I assumed that it’s Phoebe — Fleabag being the type of nickname a sibling would come up with for a sister named Phoebe."
Crashing,The only reason I bothered watching Fleabag was because of how much I enjoyed Crashing.
Crashing,"I'm the opposite, I love crashing but couldn't stand fleabag"
Crashing,Yeah it was hard to complete even first episode of crashing. What on earth was that? Stop comparing fleabag masterpiece with that!
Crashing,"Yes. Crashing is just generic and very mediocre. She would not have been a star after that show. Crashing feels like she tried to make something that a lot of people could enjoy, so she ironed out all the things that could have made it interesting. But Fleabag feels like something she HAD to tell and wasn't afraid of using her voice and her very particular worldview. 

Granted: the courage and willing collaborators to do that are way easier to find if you workshopped it over months as a one woman stage play and won a prize at a theater festival beforehand."
Crashing,I watched people praise Fleabag for a solid year before I gave it a chance because of how little I cared for Crashing. Just very forgettable.
Crashing,Especially with the cliffhanger ending
Crashing,Sam is so crazy that I just wanted him to get his shit together. Really everybody.
Crashing,"Chewing Gum definitely sits in the same space for Michaela Coel, as Crashing is for Waller-Bridge. Like, well received and all, but maybe more important as as lead in to probably her magnum opus that is ""I May Destroy You."""
Crashing,Chewing Gum!
Crashing,"as opposed to her character in Fleabag?

it's like insufferable personified."
Crashing,I found Pete Holmes through his podcast. Love that guy.
Crashing,"I do not but I just want to let you know you're not alone. I'm not a fan of Crashing, Fleebag or Phoebe Waller-Bridge. She and the shows annoy me beyond their intention. I also got the ick about her personally and I feel like she's probably more like her characters in real life than she lets on."
Crashing,"Agreed  
You're not in with much of a chance tho, unless you are short and fat"
Crashing,"So you’ve never seen the show, cool."
Crashing,No bitches?
Crashing,"Agreed, most of the characters were insufferable, but not in a funny/entertaining way like the awful characters on Fleabag were."
Crashing,"That is certainly an opinion, but I do think both are really good"
Crashing,"Such a good romcomdram! 

I think it as a show ran its course but would love more in the same vein"
Crashing,I watched them in the wrong order. Crashing was a let down after Fleabag but I could see myself enjoying it if I watched it first
Crashing,Well I appreciated the recommendation. Loved Fleabag so I'll definitely check this out.
Crashing,"""Arsehole Guy"" for the guy who told her she had a massive arsehole"
Crashing,I never put together that “Fleabag” sort of sounds like “Phoebe”
Crashing,Me too. Loved Crashing but can't stand Fleabag.
Crashing,Hubba bubba
Crashing,"I am now 2 years behind on his podcast, thank you for reminding me, work is going to be so fun for a bit"
Crashing,"You know, I think that might be what bothers me—I get the sense she’s trying to have it both ways by being this unpleasant person while saying that she gets it, so we should let her off the hook. Mind you, I don’t know her actual personality so I admit this may be completely unfair. It’s just a feeling I get."
Crashing,"Yeah I gave this a go after Fleabag and really didn't like her main character and a several other leads. Even Jonathan Bailey, while great, had a very frustrating character to watch."
Crashing,I just wanted one more series or special to end it properly.
Crashing,"One of my favourite Shows on Netflix, I have rewatched it 4 times already. Do you have any recommendations that Scratch the same itch (except Chlamydia)?"
Crashing,"I wonder if Joey is a good sitcom for someone who has never seen Friends

It’s certainly no Fraiser"
Crashing,"Martin on Fleabag was so awful, but so funny. I've rewatched Fleabag four or five times now, but couldn't make it through Crashing once."
Crashing,This is such a funny hypothetical. If I was rich I'd run this experiment.
Crashing,"Joey maybe not but Episodes stands on its own.

Edit: called “episodes” “pages” for some reason?"
Crashing,Martin is a delight. But also we're rooting against him. I felt like we were supposed to root for Lulu and Anthony? But they were frustrating. Same for Bailey's character Sam. Was happy for his eventual destination of his character arc but he was v frustrating along the way.
Crashing,"I have never seen friends, I could watch Joey. If you'd pay me. With money."
Crashing,Episodes?
Crashing,Episodes is a fantastic show!
Crashing,Money is awesome. You could use to pay for goods and/or services
Crashing,Oops! Yes. Wow strange mistake.
Crashing,I honestly forgot the name of it as well. you had me convinced it was Pages until I looked it up.  Great show either way.
Crashing,"It is peculiar that they still fly, with traffic cams and such. And not a traffic reporter, but a meteorologist?

The one traffic copter here was called a different name by each station that shared it, and eventually, they just started cutting to a guy sitting in it on the ground."
Crashing,It strikes me as odd that the meteorologist was on board. I worked at a CBS affiliate in the late 90s and we had a chopper but no reporters were allowed to fly in it for insurance reasons.
Crashing,Fuuuck the guy had 4 kids
Crashing,"Right before Thanksgiving too, this is just horrible, I feel for their loved ones and families. May they RIP"
Crashing,"Not that death is ever timely, but there’s something extra sad when it happens this close to a family oriented holiday like Thanksgiving or Christmas.  I hope they’re families have a lot of love around them tomorrow."
Crashing,What happened? Do helicopters have black boxes ?
Crashing,And another helicopter was sent to film the traffic and accident
Crashing,"""It seems the pilot that was operating the aircraft made some diversionary moves to avoid traffic” 
Wow. In his final moments he had the presence of mind to spare lives.."
Crashing,Our local news station choppers have been irrelevant for a couple decades. A couple of the late-night directors and production staff would sneak up to the defunct rooftop helipad to “eat a sandwich” before the 10pm show.
Crashing,"Honestly, I have zero interested in having a ride in one of those death machines. Kobe had one of the best pilots money could buy and it still wasn’t enough to ensure his safety. I’m gonna pass."
Crashing,"There was a clip of one news copter crash during a broadcast where the reporter kept saying ~~""hit the brakes! hit the brakes!""~~ at the end.

Edit: Sorry, she actually said ""hit the water."""
Crashing,Every time I hear about helicopter crashes I think about the death of Vic Morrow and the two young Vietnamese kids on the set of Twilight Zone movie.
Crashing,"Weird headline. It wasn't a ""CBS News Helicopter"". It belonged to our local station WBTV. They are a CBS affiliate, but the chopper wasn't theirs. Didn't even have their logo on it."
Crashing,So so sad:( may they rest in peace
Crashing,The comments here are just terrible...wtf
Crashing,Rip
Conspiracy,I didn't expect Monk so I don't doubt.
Conspiracy,"He’ll need to lay off the HGH if he wants to play a nerdy, computer geek."
Conspiracy,I think as a society we need to learn to move on from things. Let things end.
Conspiracy,"Even though the show ended over a decade ago, I wouldn't mind the cast reuniting for a film. It's one of the few TV shows that has the potential to work just as well as a film. It would be great to see the cast together again."
Conspiracy,“We’ll make a Chuck movie but you have to get vaccinated to star in it”
Conspiracy,Pineapple !!!
Conspiracy,Chuck Versus Big Pharma
Conspiracy,"I would love a Chuck movie or a revival mini-series. But ever since Veronica Mars, I'm worried that writers will find terrible ways to ruin things."
Conspiracy,"Well Subway's been wasting money on all those sports stars for awhile, this would have to be better than that.

Love Chuck and the cast, hope it happens."
Conspiracy,Just realized Zach Levi is NOT John Krasinski...
Conspiracy,Someone should tell him that his career is likely back in the D list.
Conspiracy,"After they ruined the whole show with the last season? Yeah, no thanks!"
Conspiracy,"I love these type of articles. 

""Actor says he still hopes someone will use in him a project where he'll make money. """
Conspiracy,Damn those sideburns are criminal
Conspiracy,Well you also thought 2 Shazam movies was a good idea so..
Conspiracy,"I would love it, it was one of my all time favorite shows. 

Set it like a decade later or more, Chuck and Sarah have a kid, Morgan is the mannie, Casey and Verbanski are now running the world's most elite private intelligence agency (like Archer with more gruffness and less laughs), Jeffster is world famous but broken up now (we need a VH1 behind the music style montage about it all), the Awesome's are still awesome and Ellie is continuing her father's research, the mini awesome is a major bad ass like her dad and uncle, and Big Mike has gone fishing. 

The plot of the movie revolves around the Awesome's kid being kidnapped by a nefarious secret government agency within the CIA to blackmail Elle to work for them because they want her research, and Awesome has to join Chuck and Sarah as they get the band back together, going to Casey for help, calling in favors for Beckman, and utilizing Jeffster's prolific fame for cover by doing a reunion tour as they go to rescue Elle and little Awesome. 

Morgan plays mannie on the way, there should be a scene of him ridiculously defeating bad guys with the baby strapped to his chest, and Morgan tells him and Casey she's pregnant as some point. Jeffster, forced back together for the good of their friends, finally admit how much they've missed each other and reunite for real, with plenty of terribly amazing covers intercutting the intense action scenes. And at some point when all seems lost they run into Big Mike on his boat and he's just like ok, let's sail full force into this crazy situation, no questions asked. 

There Hollywood, you have your outline, make it happen!"
Conspiracy,Last season was bad. So no thank you.
Conspiracy,But the story ended pretty well imo. It feels like there is nothing more to tell.
Conspiracy,I’m done falling for this one
Conspiracy,Probably would be his last chance bahaha
Conspiracy,"Thank goodness for streaming services where I caught an astonishing number of shows such as Chuck which I never watched when they were originally on, such as Burn Notice, Picket Fences, Lucifer, Community, and Person of Interest. They all began to wane at the end of their runs, and I don't really need any of them to get revived."
Conspiracy,Pls let us do it
Conspiracy,“For the love of food please don’t let Shazam be the last thing I’m remembered for!!”
Conspiracy,"During the period of the ""golden age"" of tv people were like Chuck is the best! Then you watch it and it's like this show is fucking straight up garbage. Wild times"
Conspiracy,Chuck went on for 5 seasons and wasn't any good after the first couple episodes of Season 3.
Conspiracy,Don't give me hope
Conspiracy,Yeah... Shazam is bombing really hard right now.
Conspiracy,"Monk was produced in part by Universal, and they're always looking for something to get eyes on Peacock.

Chuck, unfortunately, was bankrolled by Warner Brothers, and unless it has MILFs in it and the script can be generated by an AI for 6 bucks, Zaslav probably isn't interested."
Conspiracy,"Hold up, there's a Monk movie?"
Conspiracy,Monk and Psych were on the same station right? Not sure they would have any correlation with Chuck getting a movie.
Conspiracy,His character stopped being like that in the final season
Conspiracy,"Alternatively, its set years after the finale and all his time with the intersect has paid off."
Conspiracy,Less steroid shots and more vaccines.
Conspiracy,"Last season he worked on being an actual spy. Hence getting the bod and all so yeah, long as he isn't ripped as Shazam he wont ruin the continuity."
Conspiracy,[deleted]
Conspiracy,Maybe he has a new version of the Intersect that makes him buff?
Conspiracy,"Chuck had a terrible ending. If MONK and Baboo and full
House and Roseanne and XFILES etc etc etc can come back let’s not stop CHUCK!"
Conspiracy,"At this point I'm rarely excited for even things I loved at the time returning, unless it was premature or it seems like there's an inspired idea behind it. ""Revivals"" and returning to old characters/settings has become an overdone trope at this point. We don't need to revisit every single intellectual property years later. Years ago it could be a shock and a fun thing to do but at this point... meh."
Conspiracy,"Yeah, Chuck definitely does not need another season or movie."
Conspiracy,"I’m so ready to be over this current pop culture trend of arrested development, nostalgia pandering, deaging actors for soulless performances etc."
Conspiracy,"I agree. Who the hell asked for a Willow series??? I was not surprised to see it shit canned the other day. 5 seasons is a good run, sorry Zachary."
Conspiracy,"No, now be a good consumer and rewatch the Fast & Furious series before Fast & Furious X comes out."
Conspiracy,"It's almost as good as the articles that are like ""Actor appearing in project says the project is good."""
Conspiracy,"It is honestly more notable if they say they would never do it, since most actors *would* return to an old project if the idea, script, and pay is all good or great. The exception would be people who are already so rich that they only do passion projects or stage shows. (Or people who are so old that the work would be more miserable than enjoyable within limited remaining time, nobody plans to live to 100)"
Conspiracy,"To be fair, it was running on subway fumes for a while"
Conspiracy,Ended Pretty well??? Lmao one of the most fun shows you can watch ended in one of the most depressing ways.
Conspiracy,"Pretty well? 5 years, 5 seasons of him trying to get her. And when the happy end is there, they wiped her memory. It was one of the dumbest ends of a show, ever."
Conspiracy,"I kind of feel that, if thats how you wanted the story to end, you could choose not to watch any movie.

But, personally, I'd love to catch up with them how ever many years latter, just to see how they're doing, and to have another fun adventure."
Conspiracy,You must be thinking of a different show. I loved the show but after the 3rd season it went down hill. Then the ending honestly ruined rewatches for me.
Conspiracy,"I don't particularly care for the term MILF, but Yvonne Strahovski has two kids now. Just saying..."
Conspiracy,"Hear me out, Chuck, but with full penetration. Here's the thing: we show it."
Conspiracy,"Oh that's easy, Chuck applies for a K1 visa to marry Adam Baldwin, who gave up his US citizenship to go deep undercover and is desperate to return to the States. Bam new 90 Day Fiancé couple."
Conspiracy,"> generated by an AI for 6 bucks

Isn't this the standard in all entertainment writing, currently?"
Conspiracy,He might be if Zachery Levi keeps spouting more alt-right bullshit
Conspiracy,The Army of the Twelve Monks.
Conspiracy,Just announced as Peacock exclusive
Conspiracy,Oh he's one of those?
Conspiracy,"Ahhh, didn’t make it to the end"
Conspiracy,The problem is that once great show (first three seasons) went on for far too long
Conspiracy,I really liked the sad ending.
Conspiracy,"I'm with you 100%, except the Party Down revival has been great. There's only 20 eps in it's original run though so it never really got a fair shake to start with and there's still more they can do with the characters."
Conspiracy,"Years ago, like in the 80s and 90s when every single show that aired in the 60s and 70s had a revival - Leave it Beaver, Addams Family, Brady Bunch, Adam-12, Dragnet, Munsters, Flintstones, Scooby-Doo, numerous shows that had reunion movies such as the Waltons and Father Knows Best?

?"
Conspiracy,We’re at the point now where in the next generation we won’t even have original shows to bring back or reboot because everything now is based off of something already
Conspiracy,"Oh man, I really wasn't too interested in project but if Actor says it's good then I'm in."
Conspiracy,"But they still got the happy ending. They're together and all the spy stuff is seemingly done. We don't need it to come back. For the characters, they probably wouldn't want to either."
Conspiracy,I actually thought it was great
Conspiracy,"Yeah. WTF were they thinking? ""Oooh, the viewers will never see this coming! "".... well, no shit... But that doesn't make it good."
Conspiracy,"It’s an awful ending and completely fucked up for all the character growth Sarah had but it has a “resolution”.  I say this as someone who loved Chuck to death, it is what it is.  I don’t think you can really “fix” it."
Conspiracy,Hard disagree. It was a great ending. Raised the stakes significantly and my take on the ending is pretty optimistic since that was always what the show was.
Conspiracy,I actually thought after season 2 it took a nose dive off a cliff. Shaw and his whole storyline was so bad and Brandon Routh was just a charisma vacuum.
Conspiracy,But Milf Manor is obviously the best show on HBOMax right now.. the only thing that could top it is if it was men in their 60s banging their daughters friends and.. whatever else weird games they play on that show.
Conspiracy,"If Yvonne Strahovski is up for it, I think you have a blockbuster on your hands.  Chuck was never short on ridiculously attractive women in the cast."
Conspiracy,"Did he ever tweet more or is this where it ended: 

*Levi later followed up his dubious anti-Pfizer endorsement by tweeting “Just one example of what I’m referring to” with a link to a Justice Department press release about Pfizere’s multi-billion dollar settlement for marketing fraud back in 2009. And in fairness to the Chuck star, this is a drum he’s been beating for a while. Earlier this month, he shared a video from himself on a podcast to Instagram wherein he criticizes the United States’ lax or nonexistent standards concerning pharmaceutical advertising across the board.*"
Conspiracy,"Well, he didn't really.

Something similar happened to me once. My wife's cousins were in town and we went out to dinner. This was a few years ago. We started talking about the NFL, and they asked who my team was. I told them, but then mentioned that I probably wasn't going to watch as much football anymore. They jumped all over that in agreement, getting their faces all screwed up in indignant rage, and the guy had just started spluttering about how much he hated Colin Kaepernick, just as I had gone on to explain that it was because of all the injuries and that I didn't like watching people get hurt.

We all changed the subject really fast after that."
Conspiracy,And wasn't Adam Baldwin also kind of right wingy?
Conspiracy,Plus Adam Baldwin was at the forefront of the alt right with gamer gate.
Conspiracy,Be specific what did he say that was alt right?
Conspiracy,"Sadly, yes."
Conspiracy,"He's been dropping alt right dogwhistles online for a while, not even shitting you"
Conspiracy,[deleted]
Conspiracy,"Honestly, I didn't mind the last 2 seasons. Season 4 was actually pretty good and brought back the lighter tone the show was known for, it was just a hair too long. Season 5 wasn't the best but that's part of the reason they decided to end it, and I think the major problem with the ending was the pessimistic vibe when the show overall is so optimistic."
Conspiracy,"Yes, horrible ending. 

The last episode focused solely on Chucks perspective and love for Sarah. Sarah grew as a person, and came to terms withher childhood and relationship with her father."
Conspiracy,Shockingly Chevy Chase actually worked well in that show. His personality seems to fit being a villain in nowadays.
Conspiracy,">Milf Manor

i thought you were joking about title. little did i know"
Conspiracy,"Dilf Digger will appear in 2024

I'm joking, they wouldn't allow it even though it would be just as popular"
Conspiracy,jeff and lester is all you need
Conspiracy,Nobody's bothering to actually share what he said - from this post it sounds like he was just complaining about pharmaceutical commercials which is totally fair (why are they advertising to US what drugs to take when the doctors are the ones who prescribe them in the first place and we basically don't get a say. The brand of covid vaccine is the only time I've gotten a choice for what product I'm taking that wasn't otc)
Conspiracy,[deleted]
Conspiracy,lol dude was just playing himself when he was Casey.  didn't even need to get into character.
Conspiracy,Anti-Vaxx conspiracies
Conspiracy,[deleted]
Conspiracy,[Yuck](https://i.imgur.com/4IJlMu9.jpg)
Conspiracy,"What is one of those? He never said he was anti vaccine. He made a reply saying yea to a tweet asking if Pfitzer was a threat to the world.


And Pfitzer, along with a lot of pharmaceutical companies, are notorious for making bad decisions and knowingly hiding things to make a a profit. 

You can be pro vaccine and still think the way  pharmaceutical companies do things now isn’t good for world.  The two aren’t the same, only since Covid people think anything anti pharma is bad. They deserve criticism"
Conspiracy,what's wrong with doing that? his body his choice..
Conspiracy,He's a hardcore evangelical who told a far right Christian site that God cured his depression.
Conspiracy,Fuck.
Conspiracy,"Once Chuck's buddy (Morgan?) got his special abilities, I remember noping out. They were scraping the barrel for storylines. It just ended up feeling so tiresome to watch.

Then I decided to check back in to see how it ended, and for some reason Chuck (the character) just wasn't funny any longer. He just seemed sad.

The show totally lost its spark after season 3."
Conspiracy,Season five was terrible. It peaked in 2 and 3 but 4 was still really good. I prefer to think 5 didn’t exist.
Conspiracy,It was a joke on 30 Rock before it was a real thing
Conspiracy,*/Alabama has entered the chat...*
The Year of Happiness and Love,"It's a long article, here's where it says the problems start:

>At some point during the third season of Rick and Morty, multiple sources say Roiland simply stopped showing up — and when he did turn up in the Burbank offices, he’d typically avoid the writers room. In fact, Roiland’s colleagues often knew he was there only because they could hear his dogs. Or they’d hear his remote-control toy car, which had a microphone on top of it, zooming around the office. At least once, Roiland sent it into the writers room, says a source. “You wouldn’t have seen him in weeks, and then you’d see the car come in, which was insane.” Roiland would make exceptions to bring through famous fans, of which Rick and Morty has legions; at various points, his visitors included Kanye West, the comedians on Impractical Jokers and porn star Riley Reid, who gifted the room a succulent.

 
>By that time, Roiland had a girlfriend, who became a fiancée, and he would talk openly about their penchant for threesomes. “It was something we just ignored because it was disgusting,” says an insider. Multiple sources say it was also during that period that Roiland sent a female employee a “really creepy” text, late at night, requesting that she come to his home (they declined to name the staffer). “She didn’t want to run it up the flagpole,” says one of the sources, “and then it was just this really fucked-up, awkward thing.”

His Relationship with Dan Harmon:

>In the meantime, the relationship between Harmon and Roiland had grown so acrimonious that the show brought in a mediator to try to salvage what was once an inspired partnership. And though those efforts were unsuccessful, the pair was able to put aside their differences enough to secure a massive, 70-episode renewal from Adult Swim in May 2018. The pact, which ensured that the show would run for several more seasons, appeared to reward Rick and Morty for its precedent-smashing ratings for Adult Swim; by season five, the Emmy-winning series was reportedly generating hundreds of millions in merchandise revenue alone.

>In the years since, Roiland’s involvement on Rick and Morty has largely been relegated to voicing characters, for which he’d take no direction and record from his home. In fact, it has been years since anyone can remember him stepping foot in the show’s writers room, even when it’s been virtual. Recently, a similar situation has occurred on both Solar Opposites and Koala Man, according to multiple sources. On the former, which he co-created, he had, until mid-January, voiced one of the show’s leads. “He knew the power of being the voices,” says a source, noting how Roiland had revealed early on that he believed securing key voice roles would safeguard him from being fired one day. On Koala Man, on which he’s simply an executive producer, he was given a character to voice in the show’s third episode but, per two sources, the writers almost blew their deadline waiting for him. The character was killed off at the end of the episode."
The Year of Happiness and Love,Who knew that Dan Harmon would turn out to be the affable one?
The Year of Happiness and Love,"The Roiland and Harmon part was pretty interesting, had no clue they had such issues with each other. I wonder if there was a single event or just what was discussed in the article that strained it?"
The Year of Happiness and Love,"Sounds like Rick and Morty losing Roiland is not really going to effect that much, get a new voice actor or two and maybe they’ll actually show up and take direction. Could overall be a net positive for the series."
The Year of Happiness and Love,"I really, really want to know what I have to do to get a job where I…

- Make millions
- Surround myself with geniuses
- Win my industry’s most prestigious awards
- Gain an army of rabidly enthusiastic fans
- Get more responsibilities and opportunities

…while also…

- Rarely show up to work, FOR YEARS
- Be loud and derailing in meetings
- Sexually harass women the instant I gain professional access to them
- Blow company money at Toys-R-Us
- Make everyone around me look and feel bad

And literally not one person rats on me? Fires me? Blows my shit up? Not one?!

Like. How. Where. What do I have to do to get a life where I am coddled like a precious boy-king."
The Year of Happiness and Love,Why is he Sonic
The Year of Happiness and Love,"The only time I've heard Justin Roiland speak (as himself) was an episode of Harmontown he appeared on. The dude seemed really out there. Like on drugs AND a crazy weirdo.  When listening I was thinking ""uh oh...he's one of those show runners. The kind who will be in the news eventually"""
The Year of Happiness and Love,So...like [John Kricfalusi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Kricfalusi) and *Ren & Stimpy*?
The Year of Happiness and Love,"A tale as old as time: “We were always aware of the unethical/illegal actions of this person who made all of us a lot of money, but didn’t want to say anything until the actions are already made known to the public.”"
The Year of Happiness and Love,"It’s amazing how often this article repeats how Rolland is barely involved with Rick and Morty, as if to ensure it can continue on Adult Swim with minimal blowback.

That said, would Roiland still benefit from royalties even as he is cut off?"
The Year of Happiness and Love,"I don't think Roiland was ever considered a genius, unlike Dan Harmon. He was funny, with a lot of energy, and was a big part of the show's success... but that's not genius territory."
The Year of Happiness and Love,"I don't know about the rest of yall, but I never attributed R&M success to roiland, I always thought it was Harmon with a good writing room. I always assumed roiland was just voice work...and not good work at that. All his fucking voices sound damn near identical...except Rick IS unique compared to the rest."
The Year of Happiness and Love,"Is it really a surprise that fans felt his career was ""suddenly derailed"" when the reason why was kept a secret up until just recently?"
The Year of Happiness and Love,"Honestly I'm hopeful that the R&M writers will make the best of this. From this article and others it seems like Harmon and the other main show runners have been done with Roiland for a LONG time and he hasn't had meaningful creative input. Hopefully this is like a weight lifted for the rest of the writing staff.

The bigger unanswered question as I see it is what the next season will be like. Fairly sure it's already completely written (and maybe completely voiced too?) So do they rerecord Roiland's lines? And I feel like they'll have to add in at least a 30 second joke about the voice change. I hope the show carries on the same or better though 🤞"
The Year of Happiness and Love,"As a fan of the show (who’s used to liking things with awful fan bases) I was always annoyed by roiland and thought that he was only around because the seed of the idea was his from back in channel 101 days… but it’s so obviously Dan harmon’s show and ideas.

edit: originally autocorrected fan bases to canvases lol"
The Year of Happiness and Love,Never meet your heroes
The Year of Happiness and Love,"I'm reminded of what happened to Noel Clarke in the UK. BAFTA fellowship winner to career effectively over in under a week when 20 women came forward with claims of bullying, verbal abuse and sexual harassment. 

ITV had to pull the final episode of a ""stripped"" series from regular airing when the advertisers bailed, Sky had to cancel *Bulletproof* and BAFTA revoked his fellowship. No charges were filed due to lack of evidence, but he's done."
The Year of Happiness and Love,You either die a Morty or live long enough to to see yourself become the Rick ah geee
The Year of Happiness and Love,"He always gave off a manchild vibe, like he never actually matured to adulthood. Good riddance, I suppose."
The Year of Happiness and Love,Clearly this is another example of sex addiction a disease that overwhelmingly affects rich and powerful men.
The Year of Happiness and Love,"“More recently, multiple sources say that Roiland, other than voice work, has not had any meaningful creative presence on any of the series that bear his name. In fact, many of his former colleagues say they haven’t heard from him in years, and when they have, it’s been unpleasant.”

I have been theorizing this for YEARS and I’m not just saying that because this article is shitting on him. I’ve always felt like he’s been a hyped up voice actor, with the limit of his creativity in R&M being the designs of the characters and Ricks ship. I’d be curious to see what else he came up with, but it’s always seemed like he did barely enough to earn that co creator title with Dan Harmon, who actually writes it. Maybe Rolland came up with the idea, which would make him a creator, but that’s the bare minimum of what people consider a creator."
The Year of Happiness and Love,Can these people just stop being creeps so that shows/movies/music stop getting ruined
The Year of Happiness and Love,"“I turned my self into a felon, Morty! I’m WIFE BEATER RIIICCKKKK!!”"
The Year of Happiness and Love,"I had heard from a chick I knew, of his predilection. She said he was into 3 ways, but also mid teenage girls. Something like once he had some $ or any amount of power/fame he used it to hookup with the girls that wouldn't have given him the time of day when he was still a nobody."
The Year of Happiness and Love,"The moment I heard that Justin Roiland and Alex Hirsch had been hanging out together a lot, I knew exactly what was wrong. This guy doesn’t show up to work and thinks he’s the hottest shit for the work he doesn’t show up to anymore"
The Year of Happiness and Love,"I wish I was surprised by the fans' reaction, but I'm just not."
The Year of Happiness and Love,Imagine you're in a meeting and the boss drives a little R/C car in there with a microphone stuck on top and just parks it lol
The Year of Happiness and Love,Eerie similarities with John K. and how that sexual predator went down in flames.
The Year of Happiness and Love,It derailed before that. He was apparently a raging alcoholic. I hope he finds help.
The Year of Happiness and Love,"I love how it's always ""quirky genius"" instead of ""fucking asshole"" until the appalling behavior comes to light."
The Year of Happiness and Love,"Let's be real, who isn't really excited to see the next season now?

First you have two main characters getting recast and you know damn well they will find fantastic talent. Even if you can just barely hear a difference, I'm looking forward to that. And the obligatory meta scene about it. Hell make a whole episode plot about it!

Plus I always felt Harmon was the man behind the great story telling. And now this just confirms it. Without Roiland, I bet that Harmon won't be hindered by Justin's douchebagerry and we will see some of the
Best story telling the show has seen.

And there is a part of me that wants Roiland to watch R&M succeed even more so without him just so he can feel some negative emotions and knock that fucker down a few pegs."
The Year of Happiness and Love,Is there anyone here that remembers Bewitched?  One week they just replaced the dad and no one said a thing. I was confused but the new dad was a huge improvement from the old one.
The Year of Happiness and Love,"Dude was never a genius. He was a drunk idiot who did funny voices and threw out ""lolsorandom"" ideas in the writers room at best. Guy cant write a story to save his life and the best thing hes ever come up with is Lemongrabs scream. He never has or could, so I never understand why people think just cause his names in the opening titles that hes actually making these stories. Every episode is writers + Harmon with random shit sprinkled in by Justin. Writers + Harmon alone will be fine and probably better as the weirdest fans of this show always seemed to be the ones on Roilands dick."
The Year of Happiness and Love,He sounds like an asshole who made something cool once or twice. R&M is hilarious.
The Year of Happiness and Love,"I always scratch my head after reading a story like this, in which only one the interviewees is quoted as being concerned about whether this individual was inappropriate with a female colleague. Everyone else is worried about the prestige of their creative products. I’m not saying you can’t worry about that—of course, it’s natural—I’m saying…Roilands are everywhere, and they proliferate in part because most people do not care about the targets of their abuse until it becomes a larger issue."
The Year of Happiness and Love,"I've heard from people who know him that he's a total dick. Like, obviously funny from afar, but insufferable if you have to interact with him."
The Year of Happiness and Love,I have a family member who works in the entertainment industry and they told me years ago that there’s been rumors of this stuff. Sucks to hear it’s true.
The Year of Happiness and Love,It would be great if his punishment could also somehow include McDonald's Szechuan Sauce.
The Year of Happiness and Love,Never go full John K
The Year of Happiness and Love,"Following his Instagram years ago was what led to that realization for me. Getting that extra little look into how he is when he openly expresses himself quickly tipped me off that this guy just isn’t right. He really just comes off as this emotional immature, overly volatile person who can never identify when to stop. And that last one is a big sticking point"
The Year of Happiness and Love,"Not a single person I know, fans included, were surprised by this"
The Year of Happiness and Love,"It’s always great when the people in power who had the ability to call out shitty behavior years ago, all come out after the fact to say they knew about it. See Harvey Weinstein."
The Year of Happiness and Love,This was not shocking to me. Rick and Marty while intelligent is clearly a cry for help and the “method acting” behind the scenes video he put out of him getting drunk in the office back in like 2017 was the first indicator to me that he was unwell mentally in some capacity.
The Year of Happiness and Love,Quirky? I thought the mofo was just creepy
The Year of Happiness and Love,"It's not a long list, but I've never found people who have to drink to be creative to be good people. It's well known that Justin and many of the other writers would get drunk in the writing room and Justin would get drunk to do his voice acting work.

Roosterteeth is another company that's going through some controversy now and has always had a pretty steep drink culture.

I say this as someone who drinks, and likes to get drunk when the mood is right. If you have to get shit-faced to make entertaining stuff you've got a problem."
The Year of Happiness and Love,"Someday, maybe “colleagues” will speak up in these situations.  

Unless we want more George Santoses and Justin Rollandses?"
The Year of Happiness and Love,"While interesting I'm kinda skeptical of tabloids after watching Harry & Meagan. But really does make you think, curious what Harmon's take on this guy is."
The Year of Happiness and Love,Can’t trust someone in thin glasses
The Year of Happiness and Love,"""Suddenly derailed"" by charges from like two or three years ago 🤔"
The Year of Happiness and Love,Imagine being such a maniac that Dan Harmon is the adult in the room.
The Year of Happiness and Love,"Not to downplay Roiland as being a massive creep, but I have to admit; I did get a bit of a chuckle out of the article's attempt to wring maximum salaciousness out of the Riley Reid angle by framing it as him ""parading a high-profile porn star"" around the writer's room as if he had her naked and filming a hardcore scene in front of everyone to their maximum discomfort, when apparently it sounds like it was actually one of the more wholesome parts of this whole affair. She bought them all a houseplant for heaven's sake!"
The Year of Happiness and Love,Seems to me they put this article out in an attempt to assuage fans of their fears that this guy leaving will destroy the show.  It’s no different from an advertisement in the form of an article.
The Year of Happiness and Love,You read the bizarre defenses of talking about threesomes in the workplace and then you understand why the Rick and Morty fanbase is considered so toxic.
The Year of Happiness and Love,"All the people here saying ""I always thought Dan Harmon was the genius...not Justin Roiland"" are so full of shit. Some of us were here on Reddit when Rick and Morty originally dropped and y'all had Roilands cock so far down your throats."
The Year of Happiness and Love,Ah geez 😳
The Year of Happiness and Love,"I am glad to hear he wasn't doing the writing. At least I know the show won't be missing that aspect and I don't care much if Morty changes a little. The only question is how much was riffing that I enjoyed in dialog, but I am sure an actual voice collaborator will make up for this."
The Year of Happiness and Love,100 years
The Year of Happiness and Love,"Honestly not to sound judgmental but I wasn't surprised when it came out he had been messaging underage girls, the kind of ""jokes"" he was making a lot of the time on podcasts were in line with that."
The Year of Happiness and Love,I would be willing to bet a large sum of money that Dan Harmon has lots of sexual misconduct skeletons in his closet
The Year of Happiness and Love,It turns out the toxic fan base is recantation of Roiland himself
The Year of Happiness and Love,"I guess it’s not surprising that Justin turned out to be pretty fucking weird and exploitive, given how his creative career started with insane shit like Doc and Mharti

Like, I’m pretty sure most people that weren’t totally disgusted by it were thinking “holy shit this guy is nuts, I wonder what would happen if he was given a real budget and a staff”. Fast forward and… he’s an abusive sociopath! Surprise!"
The Year of Happiness and Love,"So he hasn't been involved in the show's writing room since season 2.

That's weird, everyone at /r/rickandmorty kept saying how essential he is to the future of the series."
The Year of Happiness and Love,"I’ve suspected that the writers have long detected red flags with Roiland.

While these companies are free to work with anyone he and to a degree Harmon seem to be the type of people you should probably have a “parted ways” statement on standby."
The Year of Happiness and Love,How is this a surprise. He’s a POS and said some really weird stuff to minor girls through DMs. Doesn’t help how unfunny he is either; always the same stupid voice
The Year of Happiness and Love,"How brave of these colleagues to speak up now after the crimes have been made public and their comments don’t impact their own ability to make money. 

True heroes."
The Year of Happiness and Love,But no one  still listens to Chris Brown right??
The Year of Happiness and Love,"Justin Roiland's contributions weren't even really to writing. His idea of writing is just making up characters with silly names like ""Shploobie Bibbles"" and juvenile gross-out humor. 2 of his 5 writing credits over 6 seasons of R&M were inter dimensional cable, which we all know is largely improvised, and see my point above about Shploobie Bibbles. New voice for the titular characters will be the biggest change, and I doubt very many reasonable people will end up giving a fuck."
The Year of Happiness and Love,His behavior was troubling in public.  I listened to one episode of his podcast and felt like my soul needed a powerwashing afterwords.
The Year of Happiness and Love,Thumbnail at a glance makes him look like a bad Sonic the Hedgehog OC.
The Year of Happiness and Love,Lol I saw him as sonic in the thumbnail instead of Rick and was very confused
The Year of Happiness and Love,So all the people freaking out about Roiland's involvement blew it way out of the proportion outside or doing voices
The Year of Happiness and Love,But Elon Musk said he’s the heart of the show!
The Year of Happiness and Love,When did assholery become ok some might say. Others would say it’s always been. I’m sad for folks who he wronged. Feel stupid for finally getting to these shows and then this.
The Year of Happiness and Love,What a big dumb douchebaggy bag'a douche.
The Year of Happiness and Love,"&#x200B;

Holy shit, the [tiny RC car with a camera](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ii6XuM187Zo) on it is real"
The Year of Happiness and Love,"Amazingly well researched article. 

What a creepy fuck this Roiland turned out to be"
The Year of Happiness and Love,Next time they gonna say is that he started his own religion. Pigs are people.
The Year of Happiness and Love,"If story accurate, all he did was make himself easy to replace. Never a good idea in any job. His role was get the ball rolling and voice work. Like any exec producer really.  

This is different then why most of us thought which was he was neck deep in the day to day work of getting the shows made and so his voice (literal and figuratively) were a critical component. That clearly isn’t the case.

If you think all those Steven Spielberg producing credits was him rolling up his sleeves and getting to work, you lost your minds. His roll was to pitch it, get the money on board and then sit back, let everyone do the actual work and reap the benefits.

After that the actual creatives did the heavy lifting of the writing, directing, animating while Roiland just did voice work from comfort of home. Not saying voice actors are not important, but unlike some live action shows, they can be replaced as there are many that can mimic the voice.

As for his silence, well duh. Even a first year law student will tell you to “shut the f—- up” when involved in criminal and civil cases. The worse thing he can do is say anything. Look at Adam Baldwin and his ill advised interview and how that is going to be used against him."
The Year of Happiness and Love,"For a man who created Rick Sanchez, I'll say it again, I'm not that surprised."
The Year of Happiness and Love,"Ahh yes, Hollywood reporter, they’re not bias or clickbaity."
The Year of Happiness and Love,"It really sounds like roiland just kept being himself and the success made everyone else be more cautious and that just didnt vibe with the “we are successful now so we must change” turn everyone took

You know, excluding the abuse stuff which is obviously terrible"
The Year of Happiness and Love,Whoda thought that the alcoholic who disguises hedonism as “complex” nihilism is actually an annoying and crass human being.
The Year of Happiness and Love,Incoming netflix docuseries
The Year of Happiness and Love,Yoga
The Year of Happiness and Love,How is everyone in this comment section ignoring the fact that he's a huge pedo? That news is definitely what resulted in adult swim cutting ties.
The Year of Happiness and Love,"so basically, everything was fine as long as he brought them fame and power? yeh, sounds bout right."
The Year of Happiness and Love,Roiland trying to be Rick in real life.
The Year of Happiness and Love,When I first saw Rick and Morty I thought it was funny. When I saw that everything he has ever done is the same damn voice and humor I found him way less funny.
The Year of Happiness and Love,It’s always guys like Roiland that try to get their reports to join them for a threesome. 🤢
The Year of Happiness and Love,"An episode aired last night with the toxic versions of Rick and Morty and it never occurred to me that Morty seduced two grown ass women, until just then. Never really put much thought into some of the shit that happens in the show until this stuff started coming out."
The Year of Happiness and Love,"I really like Solar Opposites, more than R and M. It’s a shame celebrities turn into raging douche canoes when they get a little money in the bank"
The Year of Happiness and Love,"He’d get shitfaced drunk to record his lines for Rick, how anyone would be surprised that he isn’t an alcoholic piece of shit outside of the recording booth is beyond me."
The Year of Happiness and Love,"Quirky genius? No, fuck that. 

I once pointed out awhile back, before the accusations began, that someone whose entire fame started with a BTTF parody in which Doc Brown wants Marty to suck him off, might not be the most stable guy in the room. I got downvoted to hell for it because you can't question the 'genius"" of some artists I guess. Those fans helped this guy gain his power, that he went on to abuse other creators and artists. They saw a guy who went through a lot of trouble to make the joke, ""a grown adult  wants oral sex from a teenager"" and said, ""shut up and take my money"" and he went on to become a grown adult trying to fuck teenagers. 

Who.

Fucking.

Knew."
The Year of Happiness and Love,"They should just write in Morty going through a late puberty, hire an actor with a crazy deep voice and never mention it again"
The Year of Happiness and Love,"Any true fan would have seen this coming a mile away, when I saw his method acting video like 4 years ago, I knew he had a lot of demons and trauma he wasn't able to deal with and his alcoholism was only going to get worse and get him into trouble."
The Year of Happiness and Love,He stopped showing up around the Third season? That’s when it all went downhill quality wise
The Year of Happiness and Love,This show is has been a minefield for its staff. I find it weird that few articles are mentioning the sexual harassment instances with Harmon as well.
The Year of Happiness and Love,"I first became a fan of Justin’s when he started his podcast way back in 2010. Generally he came off as a good person, with a crazy sense of humor, quirky ideas, and love for his friends and fans. He’d even get deep talking about his childhood, sense of paranoia for the future, and depressive episodes. Sometimes he’d come off as somewhat controlling, but it was his show after all. Just like in Rick and Morty he also did characters that went on comedic rants that were over the top, overtly sexual, scatological (lol), and just straight up funny and weird. Even if he responded to fan mail as one of these characters going on a lewd rant, he’d come back as Justin and usually say it’s just for the shock comedy and he loves his fans. Fast-forward to today and I’m not sure how to feel about Justin… Worst case scenario, he was always an abuser deep down and it’s just finally come to light. Best case is he spiraled out of control under pressure becoming the personalities he always portrays in characters. Of course neither are excuses. I hope any victims get justice. I hope Justin gets therapy. And I hope the friends and family of everyone involved are doing ok."
The Year of Happiness and Love,"TBH he kind of sucked and all his 'projects' were him just him riding the coat tails of Rick and Mortys success, and doing the same characters again and again."
The Year of Happiness and Love,"Rick and Morty fan here, and I hope most other fans can agree with this next statement, fuck this guy, we don’t need him, just find other people to voice his characters."
Blindspot,"Anyone watch the first season? 

I really enjoyed the movie, but have heard barely a peep about the show. Feels like it's been kinda left to die on a network no one watches outside of free DirecTv weekends lol."
Blindspot,My dog and I make a cameo in this while they were filming in Lake Merritt. Can't wait to be famous
Blindspot,Helen Hunt sux
Blindspot,"At times, the TV series is even stronger than the film. It's really worth a watch. You don't hear much because Starz as a channel is dying."
Blindspot,"It's the best possible version of a spin-off TV show from a movie - it uses similar style, setting, and tone but explores different aspects of characters you don't get to know much in the original movie.

Not to give too much away - but the show shifts entirely on to the family Miles (Rafael Casal's character from the movie) after he gets arrested, primarily his girlfriend Ashley (Jasmine Cephas Jones) who moves in with Miles' mother (Helen Hunt). Season 1 is an exploration of their mixed family and what impact him being in prison has on them all.

I'd agree with /u/ROBtimusPrime1995 - I think the show is almost better than the movie on the whole (but that could be recency bias, need to rewatch the movie again)."
Blindspot,"The show was great, but it basically got no attention. I was surprised it got renewed."
Blindspot,It was [the best TV show of 2021](https://www.reddit.com/r/television/comments/rp4ufb/top_25_tv_shows_of_2021/).
Blindspot,I love that you included your dog in your comment. Good on you for sharing the spotlight.
Blindspot,"Good to know! It seemed like a strange one to make a show out of, as the movie felt like a one and done to me.

But hey, if they kept the quality and style from the film, I'm on board to check it out."
Blindspot,"I really couldn't stand the TV series. I only made it past two or three episodes. Why is there a house full of naked girls? Why is Helen Hunt in this show? She's the star? Why?!?!? The whole thing felt like a betrayal of everything the original movie tried to accomplish. Did it improve in later episodes? I didn't want to give up on it, but I hated it SO much."
Blindspot,What happens to Daveed Diggs’ character?
Blindspot,This isn’t Succession Season 3.
Blindspot,"lol it's like you just picked some random ass questions to ask here 😂

> Why is there a house full of naked girls?

you mean that one bit in the first episode? because trish is a stripper with ambitious ideas, and often gathers her stripper friends to execute said ideas... usuallyin her mother's house.

> Why is Helen Hunt in this show?

😐... to play a character. miles' mom.

> She's the star?

no. i'd say jasmine cephas jones is more the star of this one. for the 1st season at least. 

> Did it improve in later episodes?

yea. i'd say it's even more creative and hard-hitting than the movie. i can see how you wouldn't get that from just the first 3 episodes though."
Blindspot,"Diggs is still a writer/executive producer (along with Casal, who is the showrunner), but his character Colin doesn't make an appearance in Season 1. 

Diggs and Casal have said that they wanted the focus of the show to be on Ashley, Miles and everyone else since Colin was the focus of the movie.

I think they mention him a few times in passing on the series and that he's doing well (been a while since I watched it)."
Blindspot,Interesting. It really seemed like the naked girl house was going to be bigger part of the show. Also glad to see that Helen Hunt didn't end up being the main character. She just seemed like a sop to a white viewing audience in the episodes that I saw. Maybe I'll give it another chance. Seems like a show shouldn't take four episodes to start being interesting.
Blindspot,"I just read [an article](https://www.polygon.com/23528392/biggest-new-tv-shows-2023-upcoming) that mentioned that it was coming ""in 2023""."
Blindspot,"Rafael Casal is involved with Loki season 2 as well and I believe both shows were filming at the same time, could be something to do with it?"
Blindspot,It’s in the works. Nice to hear people are looking forward to it!!
Blindspot,They are about done with postproduction. Casal said it's up to Starz when to air. Could get an announcement any day.
Blindspot,Thanks for this! It’s the most news I’ve heard in months
Blindspot,"Ohh, makes sense. The services probably want to twerk the marketing since he’s in both"
Blindspot,"Insider perspective? If so, good to know! Any word on the possible airtime? I remember Season 1 airing in Summer 2021"
Blindspot,Dope! Hopefully soon!
Blindspot,"Best series I've seen in 2021. Manages to be hilarious, emotional and meaningful all in one go. 

Essential viewing! Check it out if you haven't."
Blindspot,I’ve been meaning to check out Stars original programming recently. I’ve been  wanting to get into Heels as well.
Blindspot,"This show is great, Jasmine Cephas-Jones is a star. The movie is fantastic too, more people should watch them both!"
Blindspot," Fuck yeah , hope we get more of Trish"
Blindspot,"I really enjoyed it. Very different from anything I've seen, with the interpretive dancing and everything. I hope the husband gets out of jail next season because I love the actor who plays him."
Blindspot,Awesome! Great show.
Blindspot,"We just finished it last night, I love the characters but it's just not for me, I just didn't get the dancing artsy stuff.

It's really well done though, the last episode had my GF in tears."
Blindspot,"Check it out, I was very skeptical about it but got hooked over time, and the finale was pretty amazing.  Starz better be picking that up for a Season 2.

I've been really skeptical about Heel's chances for S2, but after seeing that this got picked up when its season ended a few months ago is giving me hope."
Blindspot,"Everyone loved Sorry To bother You, but as someone who lived in the town at the time, Blindspotting was the better Oakland film."
Blindspot,Rafa rocks
Blindspot,hope Daveed Diggs returns as Collin as well
Blindspot,"Sorry to Bother You felt a little half-baked to me. It was original and had a POV but felt like it was missing something... maybe because it was Boots Riley's first movie and they kinda let him do whatever he wanted? I dunno. Blindspotting feels complete and fully formed to me.

Not a Bay Area guy myself but have you seen The Last Black Man in San Fransisco? Another great movie with a similar vibe/POV"
Blindspot,"Fruitvale Station, if we’re mentioning Oakland films"
Blindspot,"Oh yes LBMISF was really truly beautiful, and showed what can be accomplished on a shoestring budget. Loved it a lot and having seen what Jonathan Majors has gone on to do, it really feels like a special film. 

STBY took like 5+ years to make and I feel like it shows. Lots of interesting ideas but nothing really connecting them, and frankly it didn’t really feel like it had much to do with Oakland. There was some forced language like “let’s go bike up Telegraph” which felt so cringy to me."
Blindspot,"Just wanna say that if anyone here hasn’t seen the movie, it’s incredible. One of my favorites of the last few years."
Blindspot,"I absolutely loved the movie, one of my favourites of that year and it deserved more love than it got. I don't mind adapting movies or shows into other projects, the people who create them spend a lot of time building those worlds so if they have more ideas on how to use them, then go ahead. Daveed Diggs was the best part of the movie obviously and he's writing this so I'm more than willing to give it a shot. Jasmine Cephas-Jones is super underrated too. Looking forward to this."
Blindspot,I hope this is more than just glamorizing strippers and legitimizing the system that keeps poor people poor. The movie was amazing. This really needs to live up to the voice and tone they've established.
Blindspot,And Peggy!
Blindspot,"Blindspotting was among my favorite movies of the year, didn't realize they were making a TV sequel for it. This is so damn awesome. Really interested to see how it plays out."
Blindspot,Looks promising! I didn't realize the show would be a continuation of the movie.
Blindspot,"I can’t believe it’s already been over three years since I saw the movie at SXSW. Instantly became my favorite of the entire festival. If the show is even half as good, I’ll probably give it a watch. Miss Daveed though."
Blindspot,Comes out three days after In the Heights. This summer's gonna be something.
Blindspot,As a movie writer i selected Blindspoting as best movie of 2018. The title of my article was Shakespearean Rap. Yeah kinda dumb but couldn't find any word to describe this piece of mastery. When i saw trailer i got excited cuz now i see that they change the side of the coin. This time we will watch female version of the Ordeal. Our boys probably in jail. And ladies need to live by. One of the best critisim movie on daily struggles. I hope it would be great as movie.
Blindspot,"Yeah, go watch the movie first. I'm assuming Daveed isn't showing up on the show due to Snowpiercer commitments, but the story within the movie itself (in which he plays the main character) is genuinely worth the watch."
Blindspot,"Thanks for this recommendation.

Just saw it today after your post and was completely blown away. Can’t believe there wasn’t a bigger buzz when this movie released.

I’m really happy that the universe is continuing with this television show."
Blindspot,"Its written by Daveed Diggs and Rafael Castle just like the movie was, so I expect the writing to be really strong"
Blindspot,"Ill be a little annoyed if he doesnt even make an appearance, it wouldnt make sense for the character to not at least visit Ashley at least once. He was also a writer on the show, so its not like he wasnt involved. A cameo would suffice even"
Blindspot,"i felt it was a bit uneven especially in the beginning but it quickly found its footing and the highs of it are deifinitely worth of watching the show.

also Blindspotting has the most creative the ""Previously on..."" segment lol"
Blindspot,Was suppose to watch White Lotus today but can't because of *circumstances*. 😩 Y'all please pray for me so I can get back to watching TV shows soon.
Blindspot,"I was pondering watching Blindspotting but spotted that it was a spin-off from the movie and could not find the movie anywhere in my region on a streamer. I’m not buying it! 

Starz definitely churn out some good TV shows. I watched both P-Valley and Hightown last year and enjoyed them a lot. The Girlfriend Experience is also a pretty good anthology show. Starz just get zero attention so all their shows sink without a trace. I think they got squeezed out by Netflix, Amazon, Hulu, and now Apple and Disney all soaking up the attention as well as HBO and FX from the old guard."
Blindspot,"This! I wasn't convinced by the first episode either, but man did it find its footing."
Blindspot,"I do suggest pirating the movie if you have to. lol. Or you could do what I did and watch the series first and save the movie for later. 

And yep, Starz isn't even on the radar nowadays unfortunately. But yea, P-Valley is great, and so is this one too, I can't stress it enough."
Blindspot,"Fwiw I haven’t seen the movie, and have no plans to, but have really been enjoying the series. You don’t need to have watched the movie to watch the show."
Blindspot,"It's worth keeping in mind as well that the show is a direct continuation of the movie, and pretty much as close to a sequel as you can get. You can enjoy the series on its own, but the movie adds a lot of context."
Blindspot,"This was an excellent movie, I’m excited to see how it translates to the small screen."
Blindspot,I was groaning reading the headline because I doubt there was any new ground the series could cover that the movie didn't. But then reading the article it's actually a **sequel** series with Jasmine Cephas Jones' character as the lead. This sounds awesome! Sad that Daveed Diggs isn't in the show according to the article but will def keep this on my radar
Blindspot,"Very cool, Casal and Diggs were also both excellent in The Good Lord Bird."
Blindspot,"Casal being the showrunner sold me on this- i hope we eventually get Miles on the show full time, but ill take this idea for sure."
Blindspot,I’m just happy to see all these guys are still getting work. I hope they get a chance to do more movies in the future. Casal and Diggs are 2 insanely talented people
Blindspot,Daveed Digga post-Hamilton has had some really great roles on tv and movies. Way better than the Andrew Rannels/Josh Gad route of doing roles around their musical talents
Blindspot,So excited for this!
Blindspot,And they just added Helen Hunt to the cast as Miles mother!
Blindspot,Maybe Ashley Johnson can actually come back to Critical Role finally!  I don't want her to lose work but goddamn it's been too long.
Blindspot,"That feels like it’s a bad sign for the future of the show, yeah?"
Blindspot,Did she run out of tattoos?
Blindspot,"I'm ok with this.  I'm watching season 3 and I think I should stop before season 4.  Season 2 really should've been the end, they really stretched the imagination with bioluminescent tattoos."
Blindspot,Scorpion ran longer than Blindspot.
Blindspot,"I've enjoyed this show for what it is, but honestly this current season has been rough to get through. Something about the writing and acting has really taken a big drop this year. I feel like it's time for it to end."
Blindspot,Sweeps is still a thing?
Blindspot,I’ll bet they........didn’t see that coming.
Blindspot,"The only network show i have been keeping up with, but to be fair  I dont think there's much gas left in the tank i s4."
Blindspot,"As someone who doesn’t watch the show, I’m selfishly pleased. I think Jaimie Alexander is one of the most attractive and talented women on earth and I’d like to see her in something I can enjoy. Not judging, blind spot just isn’t my jam."
Blindspot,I enjoy this show. It has drifted further from the first couple seasons for sure but Blindspot - Blacklist Friday nights were always something to look forward too
Blindspot,Just finish it out properly. They’ve pretty much made the tattoos and afterthought. The Richdotcom addition to the cast was a stroke of genius but it’s over. Rather have a strong 4 seasons than a weak 5th n final forced season.
Blindspot,I didn’t know this show was still going on. Did they ever solve how she got the tattoos? Did she Michael Scofield herself?
Blindspot,I can't beleive this show was still going. Is it any good? I remember watching season 1 but I can't remember if I ever finished it or not.
Blindspot,"This is fucking bullshit.

But what do you expect from an asshole network that renews a terribly rated show like manifest while getting rid of a highly rated show in TIMELESS.

**FUCK YOU NBC AND GO SHOVE A PINECONE AND PINEAPPLE UP YOUR ASS.**"
Blindspot,[deleted]
Blindspot,I'm really surprised this show got 4 seasons. I watched episode 1 and I was cringing the whole time. The actions are too clichéd.
Blindspot,She's been on for two weeks in a row. Sad to hear her show might poof away but I will gladly welcome her more often on M9-time.
Blindspot,I came to see if anyone had written this exact sentiment regarding the show. Was not disappointed.
Blindspot,Seriously. I saw somebody say that Yasha has been played by other people on more episodes than she's been played by Ashley.
Blindspot,"Them pulling it, especially considering it’s a 4th season show (which pulling off the schedule is near unprecedented) means that it’s 100% dead."
Blindspot,I had no idea this show was still on. It always looked awful.
Blindspot,"Nah, they found a second layer of them that glowed neon purple.

Not joking...."
Blindspot,"Season 4 is a lot more fun.  Rich is cast member now, and he makes everything better."
Blindspot,I love Luke Mitchell in pretty much everything and Blindspot is no exception. So I’m glad they kept going past season 2. Roman is easily my favorite character on the show.
Blindspot,"I couldn't get through the first season of Scorpion, dropped it after 8 episode.. so bad... even for network procedural."
Blindspot,Maybe the writers have a blindspot to quality ideas?
Blindspot,"I noticed the acting being way off from the two leads, especially the male lead."
Blindspot,"I love Sullivan Stapleton, but he seems like he doesn't want to be there."
Blindspot,"The one thing I really dislike about these types of show is that they have great idea and a well written plot but after they see how good it was received by audience they try to stretch it and at one point you just lose the charm of the original idea.

Some shows are not meant to be that long."
Blindspot,I’ve only watched two episodes so far and I feel the same thing. It just seems really off.
Blindspot,Not sure but I don't think it's as significant as it once was. I noticed quite a few series put repeats on during February.
Blindspot,She's a horrendous actress
Blindspot,Chill.
Blindspot,What the hell is ballix?
Quantico,The villains on this show are so much fun. I love them all.
Quantico,"Guys, why don't you watch Gotham?  I know the first season was kind of meh, but it's crazy times all the time now!  It's stupid, it's amazingly stupid, but it's comic book stupid, so it's still a lot of fun."
Quantico,I'm gonna riot if it gets cancelled. I love Gotham. 
Quantico,"As someone who watches both shows, I don't get this.  Gotham is one of the best things on TV and Quantico is the worst show that I watch period."
Quantico,"I like the show well enough. It isn't something that I plan my week around, but I do watch it when I have time.

That said, I think the biggest problem is that they kept Barbara. She's *merely* borderline insane. That's it. No deep ties to crime (at first). And no real powers or abilities. She really only ever had an ax to grind with Jim. And if the show were to make it several more seasons, we should eventually come to the point where Jim fathers a daughter that he will name Barbara. But given what we currently know about his relationship with the current Barbara why would he do that?

Maybe the writers have a super awesome story arc about Barbara and Jim that redeems her in some way that we would care about. But if that's the case, they really should have started down that road already."
Quantico,Gotham is fucking brilliant.
Quantico,"That's not good for poor Gotham, although that does look like a pretty tough time slot.  Supernatural has similar demographics, and Grey's Anatomy and Big Bang sweep out the mass market."
Quantico,"The preview for the next episode said ""Only two more episodes THIS SEASON"" if that means anything, it would seem to be a good sign."
Quantico,Everyone keeps saying it got better after season 1 and I just couldn't get past the first 5 episodes 
Quantico,"yeah I would still be really surprised if gotham got cancelled fox has gotten good at letting there long running shows have proper endings 
"
Quantico,RIP Gotham. Sucks because it got really good the past couple of seasons.
Quantico,"Well, that sucks. It was a fantastic episode, and season 4 is definitely the best Gotham has ever been. I wish it wasn't so, but it seems that the crazier the show gets, the less people watch it. I hope this isn't the end for Gotham, that would be painfull."
Quantico,I had to do a double take at the end of that headline.
Quantico,"Shame, Gotham is easily the best DC show running by a very large margin "
Quantico,I always liked this show but I hate the kid that plays Bruce Wayne. He really cannot act and just ruins the show for me whenever he comes on. I just couldn't get myself to watch another season.
Quantico,"Gotham got weird and things kept getting darker. Finished season 2 and I didn't know where things were going. Sad, since the first season really kicked things off"
Quantico,"Gotham did end up pulling out a 0.6. Not great, but better than setting a new record low. Gotham should get one more season especially if it ends on a cliff hanger. WB will not let the potential syndication packages be ruined by an unfinished ending."
Quantico,grimdark pieces that worship villains are not popular except on internet social media sites like reddit.  
Quantico,They should have made a time jump and replaced the whiny bruce wayne
Quantico,Gotham spits on the faces of true batman fans so I don't know how it can keep any fan-base.
Quantico,"Just kill it before it lays eggs.

"
Quantico,"Tweet at @gothamwritersroom on twitter. tell them they ruined the show promoting barbara

Tell them what they did with the league of shadows was a joke and whoever wrote the League/Barbara/Ra's storyline needs to be blacklisted from hollywood and never allowed to work again"
Quantico,"Gotham has done the best Mr Freeze (bar the Arkham games) in any Batman media imo, wish he had more focus as he's fantastic"
Quantico,"I reluctantly watched Gotham for about 3 seasons. It wasn't until about season 4 and especially the latest season (my favorite) where the villains started feeling more like the animated series. It's pretty good now, but it took too long to get there, IMO. I was never a big fan of Fish Mooney, btw, which prob contributed to my distaste early on."
Quantico,It's cheesy and lame. Some people like that a lot of people don't. People who like camp just can't comprehend that other people don't.
Quantico,"for me it's just too easy to catch a full season on netflix on catch up on the last few episodes on hulu.  With TNF next year, I think Gotham may be in trouble"
Quantico,I hate stupid
Quantico,They really should find a better time slot for it.
Quantico,I watch it on Hulu as I have the commercial free plan.
Quantico,LoT is comic book stupid. Gotham is just off the wall bullshit. I tried to bear with it until we got 15 year old Proto-Batman looking like a bargain basement cosplay Midnighter beating up full grown men in the last season finale. The fucking mess they've made of Poison Ivy is frankly stunning.
Quantico,"You answered it yourself. In the golden age of televison, nobody got time to sit to meh seasons."
Quantico,">Guys, why don't you watch Gotham?

Lots of reasons, I gave up on it after about half of season one, it didn't appeal to me all.

* I could give a shit about baby batman and gang
* I am sick of CW superhero shows
* Having to wait 3 or 4 seasons before it ""gets good"" is ridiculous, I am not willing to go back
* like other CW superhero shows, I find the love interest/relationship drama completely unbearable.
* I find the seasons are too long and get filled with boring filler episodes  
* much like krypton, prequel shows don't appeal to me.  
  
I am not shitting on the show, you asked why people don't watch it, these are the reasons i don't watch it."
Quantico,"1 answer. Barbara. They have destroyed too many characters to elevate barbara as a main character. I've given up on Gotham just because I know I'm going to have to sit through more ""Barbara is a badass"" bullshit comments from the fandom. "
Quantico,"If you accept it as an ""Elseworlds"" story where the villains of Gotham emerged earlier than in the comic book and  Bruce Wayne may not actually become Batman in this continuity, it sorta works in a cracktastic way."
Quantico,"* DC's decision to keep all their universes separate.

* Commercials

* The first episode bored me.

* The amount of good TV to time to watch ratio doesn't allow for it.

* While Batman is my favorite DC character, I'm not really interested in villains re-imagined without him when he was really the cause of most of their existences.

* It takes a lot for me to watch an hour-long TV show that has to adhere to broadcast TV censorship standards."
Quantico,"I quit in season 1. I got a few episodes into but only really cared about Penguin, Bullock and Selina. Bruce, Gordon, and Alfred were meh. Riddler was annoying, and I hated Barbara and Jada Pinkett-Smith.

The cons outweighed the pros, so I dropped it."
Quantico,I was REALLY enjoying it but the Professor Pyg storyline bored me like the show has never done before. I'll probably pick up the rest of the season when it's on the netflix
Quantico,I just got tired of it and quit a year ago.  It started going downhill when they brought Fish back.
Quantico,"> Guys, why don't you watch Gotham?

Because I am sick of comic book shit.."
Quantico,"Because ""it's stupid, it's amazingly stupid""

Some people need more than FUN!™ to carry a show by itself"
Quantico,"> Guys, why don't you watch Gotham? 

[I think Patton Oswalt said it best.](https://youtu.be/LDCjIjsZp_Y?t=240)"
Quantico,I loved it until about the last season and a half. I just want batman now and I get clumsy pubescent kid. 
Quantico,It's not very good.
Quantico,I don’t think they will. It’ll probably get like one final season 
Quantico,Have to agree I think it's really hitting some interesting plots. Still miss fish though... 
Quantico,SPN airs on CW. CW has a different ratings standard than the other 4 broadcast nets
Quantico,"I usually hear people say you should give it a shot up to and including episode 7, the penguins umbrella

which I did and imo it still sucks, but if you only made it to 5 you might want to stick it out for two more to see if it grabs your attention"
Quantico,"yeah I don't understand comments like this 
"
Quantico,I’m going to go ahead and assume you haven’t seen mr freeze in Batman the animated series with a remark like that. 
Quantico,"Mr Freeze in Arkham City was intimidating as hell in his boss fight. Like taking on the damn Terminator, with the way they have him learn from the techniques you use to injury him; ""That won't happen again."""
Quantico,"She (Jada Pinkett Smith as an actress) was the reason I stopped watching. The character was not great, but her portrayal was abysmal.  I almost stopped watching it due to her being on the show at all, but then they killed her off and the show made a massive swing upwards in enjoyment.  This plummetted again once they brought her back.  I reluctantly finished that season but I swore off the show at that point. 

I know she's basically left the show now, but that choice to bring back such a terribly played character was enough to sour me on the show entirely. "
Quantico,"The problem is that I want a proper ending, but if they're trying to get another season, they can't afford to do a proper ending.  If the show ends any other way than Bruce finally putting on those Bat ears, I'm going to be annoyed, but if they have him put the ears on at the end of this season, because they think it's over, and then it gets renewed, then they've got actual Batman on their show, which I think they might not be allowed to do."
Quantico,rumors are they plan on moving Gotham off of thursdays
Quantico,What is TNF?
Quantico,Gotham isn't CW. I enjoyed it from the start. 
Quantico,"I don't think anyone really cares that much about ""baby batman and the gang"". The discussion threads are mostly about how great the villains are in the show. "
Quantico,"well tbf, two of your reasons are about it being a cw show and it's not(FOX).  Also, I would say you dont have to wait 3-4 seasons, it's good by season 2.  I dont think I ever recall a show that was bad for 3 seasons but had good enough ratings to keep airing and suddenly got good season 4.  

If you watched it just for Batman however, then yea it's not worth it.  It gives equal attention to everyone, Gordon and Wayne are the only ones who get a little extra.  There's some relationship stuff but definitely doesnt compare to CW stuff.  Filler episodes are definitely still there but I like them, there's always something kind of interesting going on even if it's not the A plot"
Quantico,"As far as I'm aware most of the fandom is tired of Barbara's bullshit and we have no idea why she's getting so much attention. I get through it knowing that everything dealing with Jerome, Penguin and Butch, Riddler and Lee, Jim and Harvey and such is so damn entertaining."
Quantico,"Well Bruce is well on his way but don't assume the villains come out because of Batman.

It's more a Gotham needs a Batman to deal with the crazy as opposed to the Mob."
Quantico,[deleted]
Quantico,I think it does really well for Netflix which could help make that happen.
Quantico,I'm not sure why you were downvoted - the CW accepts much lower ratings than the big networks
Quantico,"Well the fact that they added every single one of batman's villains when he was a child basically throws out that the show is canon. 

Its a Cop show using Batman buzzwords."
Quantico,"I didn’t know she was off again, your reasons are why I left. I can deal with camp but she really brought the show (further) down for me. So I’m all, “dead? Cool I’ll catch up...Oh, she’s back? Never mind, I’m done. Thanks.”"
Quantico,"yea, I heard this season ends in a cliffhanger.  a 13 episode last season to just finish things off would nice which Fox has done before.  New Girl got 8 episodes even though it seemed like it would end last year"
Quantico,The season 3 finale was a proper ending. No need to go further than that.
Quantico,thursday night football.  It's moving from NBC/CBS to Fox.  Means like 8 weeks of no tv on thursdays
Quantico,Yea it isn't even in the same flavour as a CW show. the main protagonist is Jim Gordon not some kids
Quantico,"But they aren't that great, they are lame."
Quantico,After she was resurrected in Season 2 she appeared in 7 episodes of season 3.
Quantico,saying it's just a cop show kind of implies you think it's a procedural and it's definitely not that anymore.  It also focuces way too much on the villains and bruce to be a cop show.
Quantico,At least you made it very easy to tell you don't know what you're talking about.
Quantico,"I'm going off what others have told me (that she's gone now or whatever) but yeah, lost all interest. "
Quantico,"> New Girl got 8 episodes even though it seemed like it would end last year

It was nice how they worked so hard to make that last episode a series finale, if it needed to be.  There are some blatant reshoots, including one long conversation between Nick and Schmidt that's shot entirely over Schmidt's shoulder, because the person playing Schmidt is quite obviously not Max Greenfield, and they just had him record audio for it later.  And it mostly works, if we didn't get these last 8 episodes it would have been a perfectly fine finale.  But I'm still glad we get these final little bits."
Quantico,"Thanks, I didn't realize it was moving.  "
Quantico,ok
Quantico,"I'm enjoying the show but hate the man and woman in charge, their scenes together are terrible. 

Edit: That is a weird and terrible twist. Really? Twins hiding out at Quantico?"
Quantico,The marketing for this show has been pretty weird but I like Priyanka Chopra so I'm interested to see how she'll do. 
Quantico,"I want to know what happens next, so that's a good start."
Quantico,"This was a solid ""D"" in my book. The whole mormon killing himself was terrible, the cliched Gay jewish guy. I gave up after seeing the twin Muslim women. Honestly no one would notice? Does the other one hide under the bed, WTH..."
Quantico,[deleted]
Quantico,"I honestly couldn't stop laughing at how soapy and ridiculous this was. The girl whose parents died on 9/11, the girl who shot her father in self defense, the identical twins hiding out at an FBI Academy without anyone realizing, the Mormon guy shooting himself after the 14 year old Malawi girl he slept with had a botched abortion.......like IDEK yall"
Quantico,The commercials for this show completely turned me off. I'm waiting for a few episodes and letting the reviews guide me.
Quantico,"Yeah, it was cheesy at times and not very realistic, but damn if it didn't have my attention the whole time. That was a really fun watch. I'll be back next week. "
Quantico,This is basically 90210:FBI.
Quantico,"So did nobody at Quantico know that Alex's dad was an FBI agent?  It seems like an extreme thing to miss while vetting the recruits.  It's kinda reasonable for them to miss the death of a girl in a tiny developing country, but to miss that a recruit's dad was in the FBI is crazy."
Quantico,"Am I the only one who feels that modern entertainment is really trying to force sex-positive views on people to the point where it's not really believable. Maybe it is just their way of showing that the main character is a modern woman by having her have a nsa fling with a stranger on her way to her first day.  I feel like it just made her appear crass, and a bit irresponsible.

Then when the guy saw her, she she tells everyone around them   that they had sex 6 hours before.  Sure, she shouldn't be ashamed of sex, but does she have zero respect for privacy?  If not her own, what about his; maybe didn't want his sex life publicized?  If the roles were reversed and it was a male start and he acted this way he'd come off as a jerk.  James Bond may have slept around but at least he had tact.

"
Quantico,I'm interested in a guilty pleasure kind of way. I hope it doesn't end up like the blacklist where the conspiracy just leads to a larger conspiracy which leads to a larger conspiracy which....ugh fuck.
Quantico,It'd be a huge twist if one of the brown recruits were responsible for the bomb.
Quantico,"An aside - There was a quick scene of Chopra's mom smoking, and I think I saw a lit cigarette on Blood and Oil too. This used to be absolutely verboten on ABC because Disney banned any depiction of smoking. I wonder what changed?"
Quantico,"So you have an entire facility of people who's job it is to watch us and find the terrorist, and the don't freaking notice the gun with the real gun instead of a red handle like everyone else? How does that even make sense?"
Quantico,/r/quantico
Quantico,I liked it call me wrong but I'll watch again
Quantico,"Acting of the lead is forced as hell. She is crying like a baby despite being an FBI agent. Her accent is clearly fake too.  Besides that, you have got over the top ridiculous personal stories that no one can believe. Plus, music choice seems like they are catering to teens. I think I am done with this poor man's "" Homeland"" mediocre over the top melodrama. "
Quantico,"Priyanka can't act. I don't know what it is, but she needs to stop with the high pitch voice, desperate poor girl act. She is applying for a FBI job for god sake.

I will watch couple more, but not sure this is going to work out."
Quantico,"I can see it getting cancelled.

PC did a nice job.
But the undercover agent just doesn't suit the role and how the hell the twins managed to get into the academy without anyone noticing?"
Quantico,"The interrogation room sequence was the highlight. Also, why did Caleb get the boot? "
Quantico,This is one of the pilots I'm most excited for!
Quantico,"Someone described this to me as  ""Gray's Anatomy meets Homeland"" after seeing an ad on TV.

It really isn't far off that description, and I dunno if that's a good thing."
Quantico,Priyanka Chopra is kind of a big deal back in her home country. Like India's equivalent of an Academy Award winning lead actress.
Real Detective,"Man that interview in the show was so fucking awkward. So much so, that I couldn't help but laugh."
Real Detective,"Everyone focuses on the Santa Claus angle, but Crashmore was already my favorite skit of the season even before the big reveal just because of this guy's delivery. Every line he says is golden. The Santa Claus reveal was just the cherry on top.  


""Fuckin asshole. He said that?"""
Real Detective,"Great cameo in Dave, Biff!"
Real Detective,It was like a Cosmic Gumbo.
Real Detective,"Oh, were the steaks too sloppy for you?"
Real Detective,"He shoots a guy, blows up his head, then asks ""Are you dumb?""

If i don't get a full Crashmore film in my lifetime, it will be a severe loss."
Real Detective,People can change
Real Detective,This guy is a real asshole
Real Detective,Used to be!
Real Detective,Thanks for the recommendation. I'll check it out.
Real Detective,"> Okay, what lenses would help an audience experience this in the way that readers experience the book?'

This is so true. When I read the book I felt the same way reading about the extremism of faith (although I am not or never was a Mormon). So far the show and Garfield are doing a great job of portraying what it’s like to have doubts in what you believe in"
Real Detective,"The show has a fantastic first few episodes, but in my opinion it spins its wheels quite badly after that and never really gets going again."
Real Detective,"This show fell off so hard after the first four episodes. The plot holes were unbearable, characters were acting like idiots and the story didn’t have any depth"
Real Detective,"*heavy sigh*

Overall I liked The Outsider, but the penultimate episode (or the final episode) was a letdown imo. One of the ""party members"" has an interaction with The Outsider and after it I was just left thinking ""really? This big build up for *that*?""

It reminded me of a modern day Twilight Zone saga and most of it was enjoyable, but there were key points in the story that just left me wondering why the writers (or original material) decided to go in that direction."
Real Detective,Ending *sucks*
Real Detective,He deals with his guilt at flubbing everything through the series.  He knows he screwed up and it cost an innocent man his life.  That's why he's following Holly even though he doesn't really believe her.
Real Detective,It definitely started great and then limped to the finish line in my opinion.
Real Detective,">His first mistake was when he cuffed Terence at the ball game in front of anyone without a chance for him to explain, he felt all sorry and it was a reasonable mistake, however

It was not a mistake. He did that to publicly shame Terence.

> Ignoring the drawings made by 3 different people (one of them he’s fucking wife

His wife was all over the map in this show. In one episode, she is begging him to take the case and the next episode which is the NEXT MORNING, she is begging him to investigate.

The first two episodes of The Outsider were spectacular and then the Holly Gibney character carried three more episodes and then the show fell off a cliff."
Real Detective,There's an after credits scene after the last episode
Real Detective,I agree. I was hooked for the first 4-5 episodes but by episode 7 I couldn’t push myself to watch it.
Real Detective,"I'll keep it vague, but I was supremely frustrated by an action set piece in the finale that required basically every character being very very dumb."
Real Detective,"So, the guilt should make him pay more attention to the clues and sharp within the case, not the opposite"
Real Detective,Dude so glad I saw this. Just finished the last episode and didn’t watch credits!
Real Detective,"In fairness, very few of them are actually trained for that type of situation. They know they could be approaching danger, but dont expect a the volatile and sudden escalation. They dont even necessarily know where the attack is coming from so its a lot to take in and react to in a state of panic"
Real Detective,All the clues led to arresting Jason Bateman.  He can't trust the clues which makes him despondent.  He's lost confidence in himself which is why he's basically letting Holly make all the decisions. She confident in her findings where he isn't confident at all.
Real Detective,"Here it is, you didn't miss anything.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QZF7l9UcoU"
Real Detective,"After Holly’s presentation about El Cuco, he still gets ignorant about it and I just watched a conversation between him and mustache guy where the latter just admitted to hearing a strange voice calling him in the woods when he was a kid, and what Ralph says?
“You imagined”

Also, after Holly’s presentation he clearly said that her investigation was a waste of time"
Real Detective,"Yeah because he presentation to an entire room of people was about a shape shifting child eating demon being the killer ...   i hope a ""good detective"" isnt taking that for gospel no questions asked"
Real Detective,Season 1 of True Detective....oh how I miss you
Real Detective,"Has anyone here seen Victoria? It's a recent film by Sebastian Schipper. Filmed in one take. It's crazy. The director even said that major film festivals turned this film down because they didn't believe it was filmed in a single, uninterrupted take."
Real Detective, No one ever praises oners in porn. 
Real Detective,[The Spielberg Oner](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8q4X2vDRfRk) and the history of the one shot.
Real Detective,What about the 15 minute long or whatever shot from Its Always Sunny?
Real Detective,[This sequence from Better Call Saul](http://www.amc.com/shows/better-call-saul/video-extras/season-02/episode-08/making-of-episode-208-better-call-saul-fifi)  is also one of my favorites.
Real Detective,"It is certainly impressive, but if you watch closely you can see points where the shot was intentionally framed so a cut could be made if necessary:

* [0:38-0:40](https://youtu.be/s_HuFuKiq8U?t=36):  A quick blurry pan across a white wall, easy to place a cut here.

* [1:22-1:23](https://youtu.be/s_HuFuKiq8U?t=80):  Another quick pan across a clean white wall.

* [2:23-2:25](https://youtu.be/s_HuFuKiq8U?t=142): A close up zoom on the brown door.  for a fraction of a second only the door is visible, an opportunity to blend two cuts together.

* [4:25-4:27](https://youtu.be/s_HuFuKiq8U?t=262):  Running behind the clothesline.  this would require more than just a blended cut, but definitely is the sort of place a cut would be hidden.

* [5:00-5:01](https://youtu.be/s_HuFuKiq8U?t=297):  Yet another blurry pan across a white wall, this time with a nice dark door-frame sweeping across the screen as a line to cut across if necessary.

* [5:44-5:45](https://youtu.be/s_HuFuKiq8U?t=343):  When the entire shot is covered by the pickup truck sweeping across the screen.  

Generally speaking, whenever none of the actors are directly visible, that's usually an opportunity for an invisible cut.  I'm not saying all of these ARE cuts, but when designing a long take like this it is normal to fit in places where you *can* cut just in case you need to.  For more information:

* [here](https://youtu.be/OAH0MoAv2CI?t=371) is a video with a decent explanation and examples of such invisible cuts

* CaptainDisillusion did a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Op8KgCcoqn8) on how to dress cuts to make them less noticeable.

* The Film Theorists did a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FthEJGR61c8) on Birdman, covering and explaining the various invisible cuts used in that film.  Similar concept."
Real Detective,This is hands down the most exciting scene I've ever seen in television. I was stunned when I first watched it
Real Detective,"Not TV, but film..... Children of Men is the king of single takes, and single take tracking.  How they did the car scene (before the assassination) is just astounding "
Real Detective,"The sheer amount of people involved in the shot is staggering, on and off camera. Shortly after in the episode there's an overhead shot from a helicopter that shows the scale of the scene. Probably the most immersive piece of television in recent memory. "
Real Detective,why is everything in this sub most important thing in tv history...
Real Detective,I know nothing about film making so this is an honest question but why are tracking shots praised so much? are they super difficult to pull off and look a lot better?
Real Detective,"It's not television, it's HBO."
Real Detective,"You should watch Alfred Hitchcock's ""Rope"". The whole movie was one shot. It's the most amazing technical thing I've ever seen. And it's a great movie.

EDIT: Okay, I looked it up and apparently there were a couple of edits to make it look like just one shot, but it's still amazing."
Real Detective,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2014/mar/17/true-detective-cary-fukunaga-tracking-shot
Real Detective,Daredevil on Netflix has two long tracking scenes.
Real Detective,You wanna watch a real achievement in that regard? Try watching Russian Arc..
Real Detective,Only thing I know about True Detective's amazing achievements is getting Alexandra Daddario topless...
Real Detective,"Maybe not one of the greatest, but it's 


alright alright alright "
Real Detective,"Haven't watched this show but man this scene is great. I'm always impressed by long takes/tracking shots. Reminds me of the movie Children of Men, which has some great tracking shots like [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfBSncUspBk) and [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MjFHqohaHYU&t=0m9s)."
Real Detective,"If you ever want to marvel at an amazing tracking shot. Check out the movie Russian Ark, and read about its back story. "
Real Detective,"This and the tracking shot in ""the battle of the bastards"" of Game of Thrones will forever be my favorite scenes in television. "
Real Detective,"This same scene gets upvoted to hell every month. I love the shit out of this scene and True Detective Season 1 was one of the best things to have ever come on television, but damn, people are juicing the fuck out of it for karma."
Real Detective,"I'm on my 4th (?) rewatch of season 1 right now, and JUST finished this episode two nights ago.  It is still pulse-pounding, intense, and amazing to watch.  Season 1 truly is right alongside the best TV/film I've ever seen. The acting/characters/story/tone of the whole thing are just perfect for me and what I like.  "
Real Detective,"You'd like ""Children of Men"". There are at least two scenes in the movie like this one. One of them is a war zone which is very impressive.
"
Real Detective,True Detective S01 is probably the best thing that ever came out on TV.
Real Detective,The hallway fight scene in daredevil is my favorite
Real Detective,Such an amazing show. Too bad it only lasted 1 season.
Real Detective,"/r/titlegore.

I like the shot, but I feel the beginning of the episode after was probably the best scene in the whole series, where they tell their sides of what happened at the swamp. "
Real Detective,Can someone please explain to me what is going on in this scene? I am so confused...
Real Detective,"lets do this again in a few days, /r/television "
Real Detective,Hanna always comes to mind
Real Detective,"Didn't Third Watch do this for an entire episode? 

It took me and a buddy like 5 minutes to realize it was a single take... 
http://thirdwatch.wikia.com/wiki/A_Call_For_Help

http://movies.stackexchange.com/questions/17265/what-is-the-longest-single-take-tracking-shot-in-cinema-tv"
Real Detective,I miss you dearly season 1. 
Real Detective,"One of my favorite TV shows and definitely my favorite Intro thingy. The song from The Handsome Family has ever since been in my playlist.

The Knick, True Detective, Breaking Bad, GoT. I'm forgetting other favorites but TV is in some kind of golden age right now."
Real Detective,"It's really not THAT big of a deal. You can see shots like this all the time in student films. They won't look as nice and the performances are usually bad, but it's the same thing (more or less) only done with a less experienced crew and less expensive equipment.

I'm not trying to be rude. It's still a great shot, but it's just not that amazing in today's day and age. The amount of indie/festive films being released lately that are done ENTIRELY in one shot aren't even impressive anymore -- they're gimmicky. It's just so easy to pull off these days with the smaller film cameras and especially the new digital cameras."
Real Detective,"Daredevil episode when he is rescuing the boy, all in one shot is what does it for me.  Dont have a link(at work) but IMHO, beats this scene."
Real Detective,It's Always Sunny did it better.
Real Detective,True Detective was really great hope they make a second season some day
Real Detective,"This was so good. Another impressive one was the cold open to Better Call Sauls 2x08; ""Fifi""."
Real Detective,[Russian Ark] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv-AJ1pqE2Y) did this as well. But was a full movie.
Real Detective,"Robert Altman's The Player was my first time noticing a tracking shot 

https://vimeo.com/75881931

I see from the link there is a festival for them - looks like I'm about to watch away my afternoon "
Real Detective,It really reminded me of the tracking shots in Children of Men.  Definitely the most exhilarating sequence in television for me.
Real Detective,I bet after throwing that many hard punches his knuckles were not feeling alright.  Alright. Alright.
Real Detective,There's a scene in Children of Men that's around 5/6 minutes long of continuous filming. Excellent camera work.
Real Detective,[Football game scene in Secret in their Eyes](https://youtu.be/wE2gTZN-oPU)
Real Detective,"What's sad is that, while everyone fanboys over long tracking shots, not enough people respect good cutting."
Real Detective,This is the scene that made me watch the entire season
Real Detective,I'd love to hear what went into this from someone that was involved.
Real Detective,"I actually worked with the AD of extras who coordinated this shot on a micro budget film my uncle produced. It took 3 days to prep, coordinate, and shoot this 6 minutes. The way he described it sounded like the most intricate piece of film I've ever heard of."
Real Detective,I think I may re-watch this. 
Real Detective,[deleted]
Real Detective,"Hate to be a sticker but it's not a ""tracking"" shot. Tracking shots are actually on tracks, like train tracks. This is a continuous hand held shot. "
Real Detective,"The end of episode 3, when Rust says ""and then like a lot of dreams, there's a monster at the end of it..."" (Cuts to Ledeaux walking with a machete)...goosebumps every time!"
Real Detective,Honestly all of season one is one of the greatest shows ever in my opinion. Woody and McConaughey have such good chemistry and the story is just so dark and gloomy but it's amazing!!!
Real Detective,"theres a cut at 2:55?
"
Real Detective,"True Detective s01, Fargo season 2 and breaking bad are (for me) the pinnacle of television."
Real Detective,What the fuck happened in the middle? Why did he beat him his own men? Are they pretending to be the police?
Real Detective,*Stedicam shot. 
Real Detective,"I'm convinced, thanks, this will be my next show."
Real Detective,There is a scene in Children of Men when Clive Owen avoids a tank/fire fight to get to a pregnant women.  One single shot amazingly done.
Real Detective,theres that scene in chidren of men everyone knows it and then thers this beast of a [single shot music video i love ] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aFSD2IvXecs)
Real Detective,Dicks out for McConaughey
Real Detective,"6 minutes how cute.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Ark"
Real Detective,"This show is so incredibly over-rated, I don't even remember this after sitting through the first season, the whole thing was so forgettable. "
Real Detective,Cary Joji Fukunaga is a talented dude. The cinematographer and other crew members involved deserve props too.﻿
Real Detective,"[Children of Men oner compilation](https://vimeo.com/41218073). This movie had incredible oners, especially the city shootout, where blood hits the camera lens and stays there for the rest of the shot."
Real Detective,Rehearsal + Stedicam = No big deal.
Real Detective,"To anyone reading this comment,  if you haven't seen True Detective, GO WATCH IT RIGHT NOW. Seriously. It's so unbelievably good. "
Real Detective,"Yes, this is one of the greatest scenes I've ever seen on television *or* in theaters — not only for the content of the scene, but equally the context. It sets the perfect halfway point for Season 1, and offers an insane contrast to the quiet, measured nihilism of Rust Cohle's character up to that point. It completely changed the way I viewed the next four episodes. 

*But*...... ~~it wasn't a 6 minute tracking shot.~~ Check out the pan up to the hovering helicopter from 2:50 - 2:55. That's a cut that was built in just in case they needed it. (Edit: started thinking about it and had to look it up again, turns out I'd misremembered — *they didn't need the helicopter cut after all!*) Pretty clever in my opinion.

The craziest part to me was how they cleared the iron fence at 5:25, they made some sort of elevator rig for the camera operator. There's some [behind the scenes stuff about that here!](https://youtu.be/7YpZ7ZNjwlw?t=2m17s)"
Real Detective,I honestly did not notice that this scene had no cuts within it that's how much i was into it. The directing was incredible and very clever to use this at this scene to create intensity. Fucking hell i was so into it i had no clue and it all came into me when i saw the credits rolling LOL. Brilliant man and also Matthew McConaughey was outstanding in this scene.﻿
Real Detective,Well that was awesome
Fearless,"Between her superb turn in Curb and her work on Harley Quinn and The Flight Attendant, which she is great in, Cuoco is turning into one of those actors where I’m automatically interested in what they’re up to."
Fearless,"I couldn't disagree more.  I really liked Season 1 but after watching 2 episodes of Season 2, I find it just infuriating and quite dumb.

Cassie and Annie..get a bloody grip.  We don't need 2 people on Adderall talking at the same time.

It's just waaay too manic.  Also, we really don't need 3 versions of Cassie."
Fearless,Am I the only one who thinks the acting is kinda bad?
Fearless,Loved the first 2 episodes
Fearless,I really liked the first season so hopefully this bodes well for me!
Fearless,Is the first season any good? The Big Bang Theory did not leave me with the impression that Kaley Cuoco was a capable or compelling actor.
Fearless,TBS recently showed the first season.  You can find it On Demand.  That is how I watched it.  It was so good.
Fearless,excited to see katie cuoco go from season 1 drunk flight attendant to season 2 sober CIA agent
Fearless,Pretty hot!
Fearless,fEaRlESs
Fearless,No thanks
Fearless,"Hopefully, Sky One air it early in May and not later on, so I don't end up having a spoiler appear on the front page every time I load up Reddit like I did when the horror sub spoiled something from The Lighthouse last week."
Fearless,Let’s get one thing straight. Harley Quinn has no right to be as good as it is. Thank the lord for Cuoco and her team for making an excellent piece of television!
Fearless,She's like Iniesta in football.
Fearless,"For me, the 1st season started off great and has some really good moments but the finale did not stick the landing. I found myself rolling my eyes at some of the reveals. I may end up giving season 2 a shot at some point but I'm in no hurry, still have a bad taste in my mouth from s1 ending."
Fearless,"TBBT gave her crumbs and she made a meal out of it, especially when she was just 'hot neighbour' in the first few seasons. That show is trash, but the cast really worked miracles with the C- material they were given."
Fearless,"It’s a very entertaining show all the way through, especially if you’re binging it. And I’ve only seen the actress in 8 Simple Rules before, so I can’t speak for her acting in TBBT, but I thought she was really good in this one."
Fearless,Never watched TBBT but I thought she was great in The Flight Attendant.
Fearless,"I think she's very good in it... if you can stand a show that takes you laboriously through struggle after terrifying struggle. I watched second episode last night ... it's my third time trying to get into it... and it's just too anxiety provoking for me. But some people seem to like very scary scenes in their heads right before they go to sleep, and, if you're one of those people, you will probably like it. I know someone who likes to watch old Twilight Zone episodes in the middle of the night. He might like it."
Fearless,The first season is very good - but it doesn't really leave the door open for more seasons.
Fearless,"Honestly, this show and Harley Quinn are the only funny shows she's been in, to my knowledge.

TBBT is just blackface for nerds, in that the people who more than likely bullied those into videogames and comic books back in the day suddenly started writing painfully unfunny episodes about a group of nerds, and made everyone on it easy to dislike immensely."
Fearless,No
Fearless,Nope. It’s just marketed heavily for wine moms.
Fearless,"First season slow and almost painful, kayley not as attractive as Big Bang.  Glad second season better"
Fearless,tUrN
Fearless,"I love people who just jump into every submission about shit that they don't like and doesn't interest them to write two words telling everyone that they don't care.

Oh no wait, I don't, because that's selfish, annoying and psychotic behavior."
Fearless,"Agreed. I was actually surprised with how good it was too and it’s not usually my type of show

Plus I love how well written  >!Harley and Ivy!< were. I hope we get more of them being a couple in season 3"
Fearless,When is the new season coming? It’s taken so long :(
Fearless,"""Ooh, here's one about you. 'Why is no one talking about Harley Quinn? I'd like to nominate her to sit.. on my face.' Oh. Should have read it through."""
Fearless,They retroactively justified Tom Hardy's Bane voice!
Fearless,"1. It's kind of weird to compare actors to footballers.

2. Cuoco is not remotely close to Iniesta and never will be. Iniesta-level would be like Anthony Hopkins or someone like that."
Fearless,Season 1 started off like a fun and fluffy mystery comedy and then it was just sad and not fun anymore (and honestly kind of ridiculous) by the end of the season. Here's to hoping the second season is much better!
Fearless,Sure it does? There's a sequel hook >!with her new job!< and they never resolve the Rosie Perez character's story.
Fearless,"TIL that I'm a ""wine mom"" and not a guy nearing middle age who likes shows that have good writing."
Fearless,The irony
Fearless,Not until this fall.
Fearless,"I don't know man. Cuoco's paychecks are closer to Iniesta than Hopkins, just saying."
Fearless,Yeah.. I’m having trouble getting through the first season.. it jumps the shark at least once per episode.
Fearless,"I believe the showrunner said it would be premiering in a ""season that rhymes with shmummer""."
Fearless,I did about 15 minutes of season 2 before turning it off…
Fearless,"Wow, Stephen cracking jokes about NSA surveillance all the way back in '06."
Fearless,"And the award for ""Bravest post title of 2014"" goes to..."
Fearless,"Norm Macdonald at one of Clinton's was pretty good too, the audience seemed uncomfortable in the perfect way."
Fearless,"""The most unpatriotic bill we could ever instill upon our nation, what shall we call it?""

*The Patriot Act*"
Fearless,This is literally the funniest thing ever shown on C-SPAN.
Fearless,"Stuff that hasn't changed:

""Someone from the NSA will be right over.""

""I believe the government that governs best is the one that governs least. And by that standard, we have set up a fabulous government in Iraq.""

""I don't believe this is a lowpoint in this presidency, I believe it's just a lull before a comeback! It's like the movie Rocky. The president is Rocky Balboa, and Apollo Creed is everything else in the world...like Rocky, he gets back up, and in the end, he actually loses...doesn't matter, it's the heartwarming story of a man who is repeatedly punched in the face.""

""No matter what happens to America, she will always rebound with the most powerfully staged photo ops in the world.""

""He calls his wife his better half, and polls show the public agrees.""

""What are you thinking? Over the last five years, you people [in the media] were so good! Over tax cuts, WMD's, the effect of global warming...we Americans didn't want to know, and you didn't bother to find out. Those were good times, as far as we knew...""

I remember being 17 and watching this when it came out, if I remember right it was before Youtube, it was just floating around on different sites. 

Nothing has changed."
Fearless,"Remember seeing this way back when.. turned me on to Colbert tbh.
I never understood why on earth they let Colbert do the correspondents' dinner tbf. I know he wasn't a household name back then, but they had to have known what he was about? :)
Loved it from beginning to the end! The Glacier joke was hard-hitting as well!"
Fearless,I love how hostile the crowd is. My respect for Colbert shot up to the stratosphere after watching this.
Fearless,"Is this the one where at the end Mrs. Bush tells him to ""Get fucked"" in her charming and funny Texas accent?"
Fearless,[deleted]
Fearless,"What a fearless genius! My breath has been taken, I literally have no breath!"
Fearless,[deleted]
Fearless,"In 2006 everyone was making fun of W. I don't consider that particularly genius or fearless.

Here is a genuinely fearless video of Hitchens giving his opinion of people who make Bush jokes...

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PW4dYG9VjgA"
Fearless,[deleted]
Fearless,I wonder how reddit would react if a Republican comedian did a speech lampooning Obama.
Fearless,The most entertaining 24 minutes in the history of CSPAN.
Fearless,Not as brave as Don Imus telling Clinton-is-banging-chicks-in-a-pickup jokes in front of Hillary and Bill.
Fearless,"Lets relax with the ""fearlessness"" comment a bit.  It was not like his jokes and satire would be punished by firing squad or work camps."
Fearless,"Fearlessness, my ass.   By 2006 Bush-bashing had practically become a national sport.  You didn't have to be brave to do it.   I totally approved of the stuff Colbert said about Bush, but in no way did I think it was brave for him to say it.  In fact it was a fabulous career move for him.  It made him a star.  If Colbert wanted to show some real balls he could have gone after Barack Obama in a similar fashion for his drone war or for escalating the idiotic war in Afghanistan, or for NSA surveillance, or for any of a dozen horrible civil liberties violations.   Of course Colbert will never ever do that, and that's why Obama recently appeared on Colbert's show.   I despise liberal heroes like Colbert who go soft the moment Democrats take the White House.   They're part of the reason why Democrats take liberal votes for granted."
Fearless,"Fearlessness? In what way? Jesus Christ his jokes were funmy and satirical not everything has to be a brave stance. Mocking Bush post-Iraq, post-Katrina is not fearless. It's standard procedure."
Fearless,"I love this moment. Seriously brave.

Now he sits next to Obama at a dinner table ( a guy who has continued most of these policies) and worries that he's going to embarrass himself."
Fearless,ITT the blindly partisan from one party calling the blindly partisan from the other party sheep and visa versa.  
Fearless,"It was pretty big deal at the time.  Maybe it's more ok to completely mock a president now, so it seems less sensational. At the point of the speech, 9/11 was five years ago.  G.W. was also the president at the time, and was also the president during the attacks.  There was still a definite ""you're either with us or against us"" vibe going on.


It was bold and completely groundbreaking.   The perception of it might even be a little more complicated by the fact that Obama has a little bit of a sense of humor about himself, while Bush had none.

"
Fearless,"So I never understood why they booked him, did some dumb staffer miss all the satire and seriously think he was a right wing comedian?"
Fearless,"Lol this site thinks liberals making conservative jokes are ""fearless.""  "
Fearless,"My gut tells me this is really, really funny."
Fearless,"I had never heard of Stuart or Colbert (I live in Chile) when I read an read an article in the New York Times commenting that the guest comedian of the 2007 WHC's dinner was much better that the previous comedian (Colbert) because NOBODY laughed at his presentation, but strangely the video of the event had an enormous internet viewing.

That caused my curiosity, I had a look and real tears of laughter fell from my face, it was hysterical.
This had a few effects on me.

1)I though that the USA was still a graiet country because NOBODY could say that to Putin or others and survive (imagine a presentation for the Saudi royal family.
2) found comedy center online and watched Stuart and Colbert religiously for a long time
3) I no longer read the New York Times.

Update: for me john oliver last week tonight rules now (mostly because I go not give myself the time for two shows every day"
Fearless,"As a British person who has never watched The Colbert Report, but has been aware of him for years due to the constant usage of his material on the internet, this video just taught me how to say Colbert properly. "
Fearless,"Just to set the record straight, at the time just about every news outlet reporting on Colbert's schtick did not use the words ""genius"" or ""fearless"" - they used the word ""bizarre"" which is what it was.  "
Fearless,"I don't know if the true ballsiness of this performance comes across today. At the time, it felt like an atomic bomb of comedy/performance art. Up there with Andy Kaufman and Lenny Bruce; one of the most amazing performances I've ever seen in any medium."
Fearless,"Oh my, what a breathtakingly fearless genius! God, I don't think the guy that cured polio would get such a fawning jack-off title."
Fearless,"""Fearlessness""? Isn't the correspondent's dinner *supposed* to be something of a roast? It's not like they expected him to do anything else..."
Fearless,I just realized that the White House Correspondence Dinner is a Roast.
Fearless,"""Fearlessness?"" It's not as if the threat of assassination by Bushist thugs loomed over him or anything. You're an idiot, OP."
Fearless,Shit Colbert Report was around then? I still feel like its a new show... 
Fearless,A person who works in show business going after a republican? How brave. I wonder if his career will ever recover.
Fearless,It was good until the question and answer segment at the end. Then it turned into sleepy cringe material.
Fearless,"""Fearlessness""? For mocking Bush? Really? The whole media mocked Bush non-stop 1999-2008.

Being more edgy would be mocking Obama, something that is rarely if ever done in Hollywood. Or to be actually fearless, mock Mohammad or North Korea."
Fearless,[removed]
Fearless,[deleted]
Fearless,"First, I wouldn't associate ""comedic genius"" with Stephen Colbert with all due respect.  His character is based on a liberal caricature of what a conservative pundit is, not in reality.  I used to watch Bill O'Reilly and there is so much to mock that I don't understand why Colbert have to rely in liberal fantasies to make a joke.  And I'm writing this as someone who faithfully watched both his shows and the Daily Show, going as far as to hack my own Tivo-like application to record those shows when I couldn't watch them.

And you talk about ""fearlessness""? Has he done anything like that about Obama?  Has Stephen Colbert ever said anything about the death of Bryan Terry?  Anything about the IRS abusing its power to punish the president political adversaries? I would say that would show ""fearlessness"", but I doubt OP knows the real meaning of that word.

**EDIT**: I hate to do this kind of editing, but I just remembered [this real example of fearlessness] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpiryahOspY).  This is Dr. Benjamin Carson criticizing the president policies to his face.  And Dr. Carson was [audited by the IRS] (http://baltimore.cbslocal.com/2013/10/04/ulterior-motives-dr-ben-carson-thinks-irs-audit-tied-to-his-politics/) a few months later for the first time in his life, which I’m sure is a coincidence…
"
Fearless,And never was his cowardice and intellectual dishonesty on display more than when he interviewed Obama a couple weeks ago.
Fearless,"And yet he seems to have lost the same critical eye for the last 6 years.

To try and convince the public that he treats both sides evenly is a huge stretch.

I wish he did because is a very funny."
Fearless,Norm Macdonald did it better. You want to see fearless? Norm takes the piss out of everyone in the room. Pretty much zero laughter. It's the greatest white house correspondence dinner of all time.
Fearless,Seriously? Breathtakingly? 
Fearless,Seriously ballsy.  Whoever booked him for that gig was an idiot.
Fearless,"I'm impressed how he won over the sour crowd, even though his jokes were great from the beginning."
Fearless,That was my introduction to Colbert. It's what made me curious about watching his material.
Fearless,It's amazing because it was a hilarious set but people were afraid to laugh
Fearless,"What was always shocking to me is that nobody covered it.  The George Bush impersonator was covered by every major network the next day and people ignored Colbert's performance which was legendary.  It was the most noticeable evidence of ""Free Press"" being a myth, because everyone was self policing.  "
Fearless,"It's ""fearless"" to make fun of the president now? It's not like Bush was known for setting the IRS or DOJ after his political enemies. "
Fearless,"Nice click-bait, circle-jerk title, OP.  "
Fearless,"If you look up many of the in-jokes, say, Scalia's flick of the wrist, or Gannon, or John McCain and Bob Jones University, you'll find that a lot of times, the truth has been watered down and ""written away"" at Wikipedia and elsewhere, and in some cases search results are now dominated by outright protestations of ""nothing to see here, move along."" Orwell would be proud. Well, for some value of ""proud"" anyway."
Fearless,"Fearless.  Yeah, because he put himself in harms way and risked his life by delivering a monologue at a dinner party."
Fearless,"This is hilarious!  Seriously, the people here need to learn to at least be able to laugh at themselves, especially when all of Colbert's comments were spot on."
Fearless,"Whenever I see this, Big Balls by AC/DC plays in my head. He's really got the biggest balls of them all to make fun of the president in front of his face on national TV.
"
Fearless,"Sweet jesus, that's a cringey title."
Fearless,"Whenever someone wants to tell you how the US media is as 'under control' as Russias, Chinas, etcs, just forward this video.  Colbert roasted the president quite brutally.  I can only imagine the equivalent at a dinner with Putin. "
Fearless,? incorrect its always on display hes always infallible 
Fearless,"""noone is safe"" perfect words to start that video"
Caught on Camera,I was hoping it'd be alive so Steve could show off his signature murder move.
Caught on Camera,"My favourite part happened right after this when Graham said ""at least you spit it out"" and Chris says ""that's right, cus I'm a good girl!"" "
Caught on Camera,I have never seen an entire episode but the Graham Norton show has the funniest clips. He is a very good host but I think the interaction of the guests is a much better format than the one on one interview.
Caught on Camera,Norton might be the best in handling interviews in talk shows.

Caught on Camera,"If one would like to see full episodes of the Graham Norton Show, like on the internet, where would one go?"
Caught on Camera,"I think America has a wide variety of quality talk show hosts who all have their own strengths. Because of this, I think we're seeing a golden age of talk show hosts. 

Fallon, Kimmel, Conan, and Colbert all bring a very different quality to late night TV and Corden and Myers are no slouches either. Do they have their weaknesses? Sure. Fallon and Corden can't interview worth a damn, Conan's monologues are always the same, etc. But they're still all excellent hosts (even though it's popular on reddit to hate on Fallon).

Despite this, none of them hold a candle to Graham Norton."
Caught on Camera,That was fucking hilarious. I love that show
Caught on Camera,Graham Norton is like the complete opposite of Jimmy Fallon.

Caught on Camera,The IT Crowd.... Top show!
Caught on Camera,"BBC america is a great channel, but its commercials (including the Graham Norton commercial) are cancer.  It's the same damn set of commercials every hour (2-4 self promotions (BBC America App, Graham Norton, Planet Earth, ...), Grand Canyon University which is literally stock video set to music, Papa Johns.

Come on. Mix it up a little."

Caught on Camera,hahaha. That went in an entirely different direction than I was expecting.
Caught on Camera,I don't see what all the buzz is about.
Caught on Camera,"Oh man, I just laughed so hard. It was one of those really good ones that you need to survive every few weeks. That definitely didn't go the direction I was expecting. 

Once when I was young, I was laying in bed half awake and a fly was flying around my head. It would land on my face and was annoying the shit out me. I woke up a little while later after drifting back to sleep and realized I was chewing something. It was the fly.  Still one of my worst memories as a kid.  Bleh! "
Caught on Camera,He has gross thumbs
Caught on Camera,DID ANYONE SEE THIS THUMB?!?! https://youtu.be/tm47ydIG2wM?t=120 HOLY FUCK What the hell are you doing to your fingers Steve Carrell?!
Caught on Camera,"Kristen audibly farts at 1:49 and both Chris and Steve react. She clearly looks at Chris and touches him in a way to say ""JUST KEEP GOING"" and like the gentleman these two are they do just that."
Caught on Camera,"It''s a good show, does it air in the US at all? Graham Norton is a nice fella and they often have fun mixes of guests interacting "
Caught on Camera,You also clap a little bit behind the fly because they take off backwards.
Caught on Camera,I love this one. The Graham Norton show is THE best talk show.
Caught on Camera,Peep Carrell's thumbnail at the end lol
Caught on Camera,Are we all just gonna ignore Steve Carrell's warped thumb nail?
Caught on Camera,Why can't America have a talk show like this?
Caught on Camera,So what's going on with Steve's thumb nail?
Caught on Camera,One of them does an audible fart at 1:49.
Caught on Camera,"How hard would it have been to say ""CSI: FLY-AMI""?! FUCK ME THE NERVE OF SOME PEOPLE JESUS CHRIST IT'S RIGHT THERE JUST KEEP GOING SPIKE THE BALL AT THE ONE YARD LINE THE ONE FUCKING YARD LINE I MEAN COME ON"
Caught on Camera,I'm at work so my volume was off.  This video is a trip without sound.
Caught on Camera,It's actually physics. A fly jumps before flying. That means you can catch them mid air.﻿
Caught on Camera,Had there ever been awkward groups on this show ?
Caught on Camera,"As an American, I am so thankful to live in the age of YouTube... because, The Graham Norton Show. "
Caught on Camera,Is no one going to bring up that Steve Carrel carries a couple old napkins around in his pocket. He's my grandmother reincarnated. 
Caught on Camera,How come there is BBC America. Is my Tv licence funding viewers to watch BBC in America. 
Caught on Camera,Is that the cop from brides maids 
Caught on Camera,Steve has gnarly fingernails. Dude needs to up his nutritional game

Caught on Camera,Bold fucking statement OP.
Caught on Camera,"This is exactly what was needed on a cold NYC day , working till 5pm !! Oh boy 😂"
Caught on Camera,More like 'caught-in-his-mouth' moment.
Caught on Camera,Watch Steve Carrel's face progress from level 1 inquisitiveness after Chris makes a noise to level 5 inquisitiveness after Kristen's noise haha
Caught on Camera,"I remember seeing that clip a few years ago, but someone noticed back then that a few moments before this happens, the fly was already lying on the table! "
Caught on Camera,Why is this subreddit nothing but click bait titles 
Caught on Camera,"When he says ""there was a fly on the desk"" I really wanted someone to make a joke about there being a ""fly on the desk"" during a ""fly on the wall"". "
Caught on Camera,And you won't believe what happens next!

Caught on Camera,OMG I'm crying!! That was so great!! 😂😂😂
Caught on Camera,"The amusingly clever way I learned to get flies is to point at it from about a foot up, and at *moderate speed* move your pointer finger in a spiral just slightly larger than a golfball, while *very slowly* getting closer and closer to it. It sees your hand and finger, but it can't actually tell that you're getting closer and closer to it due to the circular motion of your spiraling finger. If done right, and nothing else startles the fly, you can get close enough to just squish it with your finger."
Caught on Camera,"I saw this years ago. I could've posted this and gotten 6,020 upvotes. Rats."
Caught on Camera,Is it though?
Caught on Camera,"As a Canadian I discovered this show on YouTube a few years ago and became addicted to it, especially the red chair segments. There's nothing like it anywhere that I know of."
Caught on Camera,I see Steve Carell and Kristen Wiig I upvote
Caught on Camera,This could have totally been an episode of the office

Caught on Camera,Was it PETA that asked Obama to apologize for killing a fly on cam? Am I remembering this correctly?
Caught on Camera,"What is everyone talking? The best part of this video is at 1:48 the woman past gas. The guy who ate the fly look at her, and tried to play it off. She farted "
Caught on Camera,"I like the clip, but what a clickbait title. How about ""My favorite""? It's completely thrown me off the clip. "
Caught on Camera,This was fun 
Caught on Camera,Why is Steve dressed up like John Oliver?
Caught on Camera,/u/HerefortheCapnCrunch
Caught on Camera,I've seen several clips of this guy's show. How does he get so many celebrities together like that constantly? Just very popular?
Caught on Camera,How many talk show moments were not caught on camera...
Caught on Camera,The fly killing trick really works. I learned it from this clip and amaze people all the time with it.
Caught on Camera,No it isn't.
Caught on Camera,lmao
Caught on Camera,"Do you Americans just watch Graham Norton clips on YouTube? Like, it's an average Friday night for us watching the show, but I always see the clips popping up here..."
Caught on Camera,Has this video been saturated on purpose? Everyone has a tan
Behind Enemy Lines,"Since TV networks are churning out so many shows based on movies, might as well add my own wish list for the next batch of movies to be adapted to TV shows: 
 
* The Fugitive. (The Harrison Ford movie was based on an old TV show from the 70s iirc)
* Enemy of the State. 
* L.A. Confidential.
* Die Hard. 
* Ronin.
* Bad Boys.
* Deep Rising.
* Species.
* Invasion of the Body Snatchers. "
Behind Enemy Lines,"I don't know why this exists, but that's a great cast."
Behind Enemy Lines,Of all the somewhat above average movies to reboot into a TV show... I wouldn't have guessed this one. What new TV adaptations are we gonna get next? The Peacemaker? Conspiracy Theory? The Negotiator? Tears of the Sun?
Behind Enemy Lines,Another TV show based on an old film everyone kind of already forgot about that will no doubt have just a tenious connection to the film in question
Behind Enemy Lines,The original Fugitive was on in the early 60s. There was a show that was on in 2000 too. 
Behind Enemy Lines,Might as well throw in Mars Attacks.
Behind Enemy Lines,Maybe it's just me but I thought The Negotiator was pretty good.
Behind Enemy Lines,"Of course it's watchable. If you read my comment, I did say ""somewhat above average""."
Behind Enemy Lines,"I mean, you did put it next to Tears of the Sun."
Behind Enemy Lines,"Heyyy, that one wasn't that bad! :D"
Behind Enemy Lines,¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
Behind Enemy Lines,"Read that as ""Star Fox: Behind Enemy Lines"" and got a little too excited."
Behind Enemy Lines,"that article bashes the movie, but i actually enjoyed it.

no idea how i feel about a tv show version of it, but whatever, we'll see i guess"
Behind Enemy Lines,"Haven’t seen it, but I gather that this happened with Netflix’s “Altered Carbon.”"
Behind Enemy Lines,Heroes
Behind Enemy Lines,Walking Dead.
Behind Enemy Lines,"House of Cards. At its height (around season 2 to 3, I'd say), it was one of the best shows on TV, and r/television was all over it. Then real life became more interesting and outpaced what the show could keep up with, Spacey was outed as a predator, and the writing fell off a cliff. Now nobody ever talks about it."
Behind Enemy Lines,"You know what, Sliders did this as well."
Behind Enemy Lines,[deleted]
Behind Enemy Lines,"The first 3 seasons are fantastic, but as you said, season 4 is unwatchable and a whole different tone/show."
Behind Enemy Lines,"It's already looking like this thread is going to have the same discussion it seems to have every other day about which shows declined in quality and stuff like that.  It's nice that you brought up New York Undercover, I didn't know it was streaming.  I know BET was airing reruns recently and I watched a few episodes.  I used to watch it back in the day, I think I stopped around Season 3 or around there.  It was a really long time ago, so I can't really elaborate on what exactly changed, but I know I wasn't enjoying it as much as I used to so I stopped watching.  It was a very unique show for its time, in that the two main characters, detectives were minorities and their captain was a woman.  And it felt natural, it didn't feel like they were pandering.  It had that Dick Wolf feel like Law and Order, but it had a more gritty, on the ground quality since it was just about the cops.  I'm just giving my really basic assessment; again, I hadn't watched it in a very long time until recently, and only a couple of episodes at that.  Malik Yoba and Lauren Velez seem to have had pretty decent careers, I still see them in stuff to this day.  I don't know what happened with Michael DeLorenzo, I don't recall seeing him in anything after this."
Behind Enemy Lines,Did you miss the news about Game of Thrones?
Behind Enemy Lines,Westworld

Behind Enemy Lines,"Might be easier to list series that didn't dip in quality. The better the series, the more they try and get blood out of the stone as it runs out of material."
Behind Enemy Lines,Arrow ran so far off a cliff at one point that the show's own subreddit gave up on it and became a Daredevil sub instead.
Behind Enemy Lines,Let me tell you about a show we used to call “Sliders”…
Behind Enemy Lines,Helix.
Behind Enemy Lines,I think Dexter *killed* it for the first 4 seasons and then dipped at a rapid pace after that.
Behind Enemy Lines,NYPD Blue(s)
Behind Enemy Lines,Did you hear about the last season of Game of Thrones?
Behind Enemy Lines,Ny undercover wasn’t good ever tho
Behind Enemy Lines,"SNL.  They had the hottest actor currently in the world, Pedro Pascal, and bombed in all live skits with him."
Behind Enemy Lines,"Exclusive for a dub of a show, but the original DiC production of Sailor Moon ended up suffering a loss of quality rather rapidly with even the original English dub's voice actors outright stating that they agreed with fans that the dub was completely rubbish. In fact, the show's second voice actress for Setsuna/Trisha/Sailor Pluto, Susan Aceron, even said that it was a mistake that she was cast to be in that series at all.

There's actually a known and stated reason for this, however, as given by Roland Parliament who was the voice of Umino/Melvin and the show's second ADR (Automated Dialogue Replacement) director in his autobiography *Sailor Moon Reflections*.

In short, the first voice of Sailor Moon, Tracey Moore, was also the show's first ADR director but was so heavily overworked that she suffered from burnout and quit thirteen episodes into the show's production (episodes 1-11, 15 and 21), so when she quit she was replaced with Roland.

They tried to keep her in the role by replacing her as ADR director with castmates who had smaller roles in the show. But because of clashes with a producer at Optimum Productions, Nicole Thuault who also heavily clashed with Moore while she was the ADR director, Parliament was fired from the role as ADR director as well as his replacement John Stocker, who played Rei's grandfather in the dub.

When Optimum completed their original recording sessions for the show, DiC decided to stop licensing the show and left them stranded. But Cartoon Network and YTV wanted more episodes dubbed so they paid for it themselves and ordered the adaptations directly. All 77 remaining episodes... in four months. Optimum couldn't get most of the original cast for a number of reasons - some of the voice actors hated the conditions and refused to come back while at least one of them outright couldn't due to being on maternity leave.

After this, Thuault decided that she might as well take on the role as the show's ADR director instead. This was despite the fact that despite being a producer on the show's English dub, *she didn't fucking speak English* and in fact needed a translator on-site to help her communicate with the cast and crew. By the way, did I mention that Optimum was based out of Ontario?

So, the ADR director wasn't able to properly quality control the recording, they had to adapt 77 episodes of the show in four months and most of the original cast was gone. They only had four hours to record each episode and took were only allowed to do two takes for each scene/episode and decided to use the one that wasn't shit. Quality dropped immensely, the seasons adapted were widely hated until the entire series was re-dubbed by Viz and it proved to be such an old shame that the DiC dub will never be rereleased again.

And for added hilarity, when they were doing the translation of the scripts into English, because of a stupid term of the contract that they were using, they weren't adapting the original Japanese scripts of the show but the earlier French dub produced in Paris.

Oh, and here's something funny I wanted to bring up as well. They had to make some changes to the show to appease US censors, mainly because the show could actually get somewhat violent for US audiences. One pair of junior high school students were expressly a pair of lesbians in the original Japanese version which was turned into them being cousins in the English dub... but they didn't fully remove all of the pretext, so it made them look like teenage *incestuous* lesbians instead."
Behind Enemy Lines,“Unreal”. Season 1 was great but season 2 was garbage. Iirc the main show runner left the series at the end of season 1 and took all of the writing talent with her.
Behind Enemy Lines,"Designated Survivor very good for around 2 seasons, then it fell off..."
Behind Enemy Lines,Rogue
Behind Enemy Lines,"Yellowstone, where Taylor Sheridan's inability to work with a collaborative writing staff combined with his ever growing list of spinoffs/projects/ranches has taxed his ability to maintain a consistent plot that makes some sort of rational sense."
Behind Enemy Lines,Ive never seen a show drop as hard as game of thrones
Behind Enemy Lines,"Biggest drop in quality I've seen in a show was Man in the High Castle.

The first two seasons had some really incredible writing.  The alternate historical worldbuilding felt really thoughtfully crafted and rich, the tone and setting were suspenseful and engaging, and the character writing was generally fantastic.  I've heard some criticism that the main couple characters felt a little bland but I feel like that was intentional and in a way fits with the bleak scenarios they are in.  But regardless, any lack in Juliana's character is easily made up for by an astounding cast of deeply written and rich characters (friends and foes) around her.  I know I am absolutely not alone in saying that John Smith had the potential to be one of the greatest television characters of all time if they had stuck the landing - his story and how it was told was truly one of the most engrossing and compelling stories I've seen in film.

And then it feels like between seasons 2 and 3 the entire writing team got scrapped and replaced.  Season 3 kinda just felt like it had lost a bit of an aim and was missing some depth, but was by no means unsalvageable... And then season 4 jumped the shark, flew right off a cliff and landed in an absolutely crushing disaster of a dumpster fire.  Gone was any sense of historical basis and every single carefully crafted and compelling character arc took a major random turn into stupidity and pathetic oblivion."
Behind Enemy Lines,"Any Bryan Fuller show.

The x Files briefly made sense."
Behind Enemy Lines,"First season was so fucking good, I REALLY like it. Now let's make a second season that it not cyber OR punk, just a boring loving story. I was so pissed, and still am."
Behind Enemy Lines,Altered Carbon suck from ep 1
Behind Enemy Lines,"Never seen it, but I've heard negative things."
Behind Enemy Lines,"This is a great answer, I remember watching week to week every season and asking myself ""Why"". 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

And then the reboot happened..."
Behind Enemy Lines,"It's less about the ""real life"" thing and more because they had no idea how to write an interesting show about Frank as President and Season 3 became bloated and boring. There were a *lot* of comments on this very sub about how people had trouble paying attention to Season 3."
Behind Enemy Lines,show was trash even before all the spacey stuff happened. season 3 was already dumb as fuck
Behind Enemy Lines,"Yup, at the season 3 finale."
Behind Enemy Lines,"I was about to tap out during mid season 3, but I wanted to see how it wrapped up as I didn't remember details. 

But yes, jarring to say the least."
Behind Enemy Lines,"Two non white cops with a female boss. Characters using racial slurs to help drive the point of the episode home (for example white kid accused of bombing black churches). Pretty edgy for the time but it was Fox, after all. 

One thing the show portrayed was a strong, black man that was an attentive father. It often bucked stereotypes but sometimes would fall victim to some obvious preaching. 

Then maybe halfway into season 3, the show became more generic, and lost some of the ""urban"" feel. I'm as white as they come, but grew up in an area where I was the minority. 

Another thing that stuck with me was the subject matter. Lots of kids being killed on camera, and other brutal crimes relating to children either as victims or perpetrators. 

Lastly, it made NYC look just as dirty as it really was at the time."
Behind Enemy Lines,"Oh I've seen it, multiple times. While I agree with what you're saying, that debate has had its day in the sun."
Behind Enemy Lines,"I didnt like the second season, but felt the 3rd was pretty good"
Behind Enemy Lines,Ugh. That one really annoyed me. It was my introduction to sci-fi and I immediately loved it. Recently watched the series again as well.
Behind Enemy Lines,Fell off a cliff mid season 1
Behind Enemy Lines,Hot take.
Behind Enemy Lines,"*opens mouth to bring up* [*Mario Kart*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiIRlg4Xr5w)

> “live skits”

*closes mouth*"
Behind Enemy Lines,no u
Behind Enemy Lines,first season was amazing and incredibly popular.  then the writers strike hit.
Behind Enemy Lines,"There is a a behind the scenes documentary on YouTube about it.  There was an edict tfrom the network during season 3 to tone down the urban feel of the show.  At the same time, the two leads basically demanded more money before the start of the season. Cooler heads prevailed but everyone on the show was shocked when they got that final script and seeing that Eddie was being killed off.  Keep in mind, the ratings for the show were still strong.

The killing of Eddie Torrez essentially killed the audience.   Eddie/JC were the show. And it is especially frustrating when you realize how unneeded it was. In the storyline they had already written his character off by having him have to move to a different precinct.  And, he didn't die in a multi-episode arc or from a meaningful villain like Ice-T.  It was a random villain of the week that blows him up.

Audiences were pissed, and within a few episodes of season 4 it was clear they weren't coming back. The show was canceled pretty quickly into season 4."
Behind Enemy Lines,"Yes, I believe New York Undercover was part of Fox's Thursday night bloc, which were all shows with a (mostly) minority cast.  I believe it was Martin, then Living Single, then New York Undercover (since Fox's prime time slot was just two hours, and still is today).

Your view on what changed about the show sounds about right.  I can't point to anything specific (that time/memory thing yet again), but it started feeling ""samey"".  A part of television since its inception has been shows about cops and the law, and so many of them seemed to hit the same exact note.  New York Undercover appealed to me because it felt so fresh and raw compared to the other cop shows airing at that time.  My theory is that the ratings were flat and the consultants at the network wanted to boost them up, so they ""retooled"" it and took away what made it fresh and raw and different.  Again, something you see to this day."
Behind Enemy Lines,Absolutely. It does make you wonder how much bigger a deal stories like yours would have been if social media had been a thing much earlier.
Behind Enemy Lines,"Yeah, there was a point where everyone literally stopped caring about the infectious plague currently in their research station cause the writers were already on the next idea lol"
Behind Enemy Lines,"It’s true, it was just different the cops weren’t white, that was all it had going for it, and I watched it every week"
Behind Enemy Lines,I also loved the chicken wings commercial
Behind Enemy Lines,"There's nothing wrong with Saturday Night Taped but Saturday Night Live is broke.  

I love Update, but even it's writing is getting worse."
Behind Enemy Lines,"Don't let the writers off that easy. The strike is why the season was only 11 episodes long, not why those 11 episodes were bad. Scripted TV shut down for a few months, they didn't replace their writers."
Behind Enemy Lines,"Yup. I remember how he died but was surprised at the fact he'd have to leave the precinct due the marriage. Ok fine, so leave, don't show him on screen. Made no since. Something similar happened on SVU where Rollins quit the force to become a professor. In reality she didn't get the money she wanted, so they wrote her off. 

People underestimate Latin/Hispanic support. This was a prime example of that."
Behind Enemy Lines,"Well, name another cop drama that showed 90s NYC for what it actually was? Nothing about this show was pretty."
Behind Enemy Lines,"Me too, but not a live skit."
Behind Enemy Lines,"And it continued to be crap in the following seasons. 

The writers strike maybe made the downfall quicker but it was inevitable. It's clear that season 1 was the only one they really had figured out a story to tell. After that it was just milking it and making shit up as it went along."
Behind Enemy Lines,"That doesn’t make it good tho, accuracy doesn’t equal quality"

Behind Enemy Lines,Enjoyed it when it was on. Especially Wade.
Behind Enemy Lines,"I miss this show and wish it was able to get more seasons.

The movie to close the series just felt rushed but I’m glad HBO at least gave them that."
Behind Enemy Lines,Such a funny show. Stephen merchant is underrated
Behind Enemy Lines,"I loved it, the tapdancing scene is one of the cringiest things I've ever seen. Haven't watched it since it aired but still remember it."
Behind Enemy Lines,"I really enjoyed it.  
  
Just finished his most recent series ""The Outlaws"" which was on BBC here in the UK. About a bunch of people on Community Service in Bristol, and randomly stars Christopher Walken."
Behind Enemy Lines,Such a hilarious show. My favorite sequence is Merchant going back and forth between the limo and lounge because he thinks he can hook up with his roommate's friend.
Behind Enemy Lines,When they are in the bathroom at the club and he lies to the bouncer!
Behind Enemy Lines,I had heard of it but had another look after your post.  There's a movie with mixed reviews if you didn't know: https://www.imdb.com/title/tt12944538/
Behind Enemy Lines,"Amazing character arc that was only realized in the movie, unfortunately.  I loved him."
Behind Enemy Lines,"Right? I felt the same way.  I was wondering how that movie came about.  Were they contractually obligated to do it or did they pitch it to the network? I’m not sure.  

Of all the crud in the past three years I’ve watched that did not deserve a second season, I’m bummed they didn’t get a round 2.

The same goes for HBO’s Enlightened which I was obsessed with.  That deserved two more seasons at least."
Behind Enemy Lines,"I can completely co-sign this comment, would have been my near exact statement. Great little show and it’s *still* a pleasant surprise it got the wrap up movie. So many little satisfying series would be more beloved and recommended if it had the closure, at least, like this got."
Behind Enemy Lines,Lanky cowriter
Behind Enemy Lines,He's to Ricky Gervais what Larry David is to Jerry Seinfeld.
Behind Enemy Lines,"Merchant wrote Hello Ladies, correct?  The writing on this show has made me want to seek out stuff he's done since Hello Ladies ended."
Behind Enemy Lines,"Love that scene! There was also some insanely ballsy humor around color and race (at the pool party) that they handled quite well.  This show had no issues making Merchant look like a total ass.

Ask the StoryBots,Couldn't happen to a better person.
Ask the StoryBots,Quan and Brendan Fraser movie team-up when?
Ask the StoryBots,Let's fucking go! He was my favorite part of EEAAO. The emotional heart and soul of the movie
Ask the StoryBots,"Ke Huy Quan (aka Short Round Temple of Doom and Data in Goonies) was in Everything, Everywhere, All At Once?  Man i'm an asshole for not realizing this, tho to be fair, I didn't recognize Jamie Lee Curtis as the IRS employee either."
Ask the StoryBots,He was brilliant as Waymond. I mean he had to play two different characters for the same guy. Can't wait to see him in here.
Ask the StoryBots,i find this man so attractive ✨
Ask the StoryBots,A amazingly talented actor is asked to be a part of something big. I love it.
Ask the StoryBots,"He’s just such a great bloke who’s over the moon about his recent success, can’t help but root for him"
Ask the StoryBots,"""I wanted to talk to you about the Multiverse Initiative..."""
Ask the StoryBots,I got Kevin Feige and Paul Feig switched and wondered why he was so proud of that...
Ask the StoryBots,"He’s earned it just with his performance in “Everything”

Even amid all the chaos, I was hanging on every heart felt word of how no matter what, he would’ve been perfectly happy doing laundry and counting receipts with her"
Ask the StoryBots,Marvel’s casting is so funny. They love to just try to snatch up whoever is hot. Chloe Zhao wins an Oscar? Get her! We need someone to tell Kevin that sunsets are real!
Ask the StoryBots,"I’m so happy he’s seeing success upon returning to Hollywood. Him and Fraser getting their career resurgence is what we needed right now. Both seem like incredibly decent and humble people, yet Hollywood treated them abysmally while putting obvious pieces of shit in film after film.

Hollywood is a cesspool, but it’s great to see talented and genuinely good people finally getting the recognition they’ve always deserved."
Ask the StoryBots,Why wouldn't he? He's really popular among cinephiles nowadays.
Ask the StoryBots,Well deserved. Looking forward to Loki s2!
Ask the StoryBots,He is awesome. Im so happy for him
Ask the StoryBots,"I hope to see him in a lot more! EEAAO made me cry embarrassingly hard, and his performance in it was absolutely fantastic. That whole movie is a masterpiece."
Ask the StoryBots,I'm so happy for this dude.  As a product of the 80s I've watched goonies and temple of doom countless times and loved the characters he played.  I'm thrilled for him and his success.
Ask the StoryBots,"That's awesome! I met him at a comic con near me once. He was really nice. I was surprised seeing him in Everything, Everywhere, All At Once but I saw it twice at the theater. It was nice to see him return to acting, and in such a big role."
Ask the StoryBots,"I'm so happy for him.  I really felt for him when he said before this movie came up, all he really wanted was a job.  He striked out on auditions and was asking his agent to get him as a regular in a TV series so he can have a stable income.  We only hear about famous people in the news but there are so many struggling actors.  He deserves all the accolades, looking forward to seeing him more on screen."
Ask the StoryBots,"The rumor is that it was to be a recurring variant and, should fans seem to be accepting of the potential, becoming the main loki for the series going forward when tommy hidds needs out."
Ask the StoryBots,Let's hope they actually use him.
Ask the StoryBots,"Oh man, I'm happy he got another big gig. Really hope this continues for him."
Ask the StoryBots,I’d be kinda happy with an Indiana revival where Short picks up the hat
Ask the StoryBots,I am really happy for him.
Ask the StoryBots,The Ke Huy Quan timeline IS the Sacred Timeline
Ask the StoryBots,If I could afford it I'd hire Ke just to have lunch with me and personally tell me his life story
Ask the StoryBots,"To be fair, who doesn’t love KHQ?"
Ask the StoryBots,"He'd be solid in that show, I can't think of many I'd enjoy more than maybe just Rick Moranis being a comedic screwup 'head of legal' in the Time Bureau.  And most of that comes from just loving that lovable goof."
Ask the StoryBots,Can’t wait for the sequel “Somethings sometimes every once in a blue”
Ask the StoryBots,Did he accept?
Ask the StoryBots,"I wasn't too much a fan of the Loki end episode, but I'll probably tune in to see what they have for Ke Huy Quan."
Ask the StoryBots,"I know it sounds great and absolutely love the guy, but this reveals how Hollywood recruits on popularity and not relevance towards the role. Someone is popular and got success, you want them in your project. No audition, or else. Every project now seems to work that way, you want to work with this person or that one because they are buzzing. I know i sound like a hater but I think it's kinda sad."
Ask the StoryBots,Then Kevin retracted the offer because he likes his secrets
Ask the StoryBots,Quan would make a great Stormlight actor in the future.
Ask the StoryBots,"Do EET!!

I want him to have success. He seems like such a nice human."
Ask the StoryBots,Yay!! I’m here for everything Shortround!
Ask the StoryBots,Shortround is the best. Ke gives hope to Asians who want to act in Hollywood.
Ask the StoryBots,Hell yeah.
Ask the StoryBots,So happy for him!
Ask the StoryBots,Now he has to invite the Daniels to direct a movie
Ask the StoryBots,"I’m so fuhkin proud of this man, my lord! GOAT went from The Goonies to the anticipated season 2 of Loki. What an inspiration! 🏆🫡"
Ask the StoryBots,He better be a hero and not another suit.
Ask the StoryBots,So fucking happy about this.  As kids with the Goonies we idolized Data.
Ask the StoryBots,"I'm really happy for him 😭❤️
He and Brendan Frasier definitely deserve all the recognition they're getting recently"
Ask the StoryBots,"And knowing Ke Huy Quan, it probably went like this 

Kevin: Hey Quan, I saw a universe where you were in the MCU. Want to join?

Ke Huy Quan: I wouldn't mind that. Living in a universe where I star in the MCU along side that guy from Crimson Peak."
Ask the StoryBots,The marvel universe is not good enough for Ke.
Ask the StoryBots,why do we need a season 2 of that terrible show?
Ask the StoryBots,"Fuck mcu. Shallow garbage, he deserves better movie roles"
Ask the StoryBots,The MCU will do anything to remind people of better media except for reminding them of comic books.
Ask the StoryBots,"It’s a trap!! Stay awayyy heed Zoe, Elizabeth and Dave’s warnings!!!"
Ask the StoryBots,[deleted]
Ask the StoryBots,He can do better.
Ask the StoryBots,Couldn't finish this movie. off after an hour
Ask the StoryBots,"The MCU is dead Kevin, just face it. You killed it."
Ask the StoryBots,"Loki season one sucked
Edit: Loki season one sucked ASS"
Ask the StoryBots,"You remember when things in the MCU weren't allowed to be mentioned and everything was under major hush, hush secrecy?  If they could go back to that, it would be great.  All of Black Panther 2 was spoiled ahead of release, so I didn't bother.  I know this isn't on the same level, but I remember when they weren't even allowed to say they were in a film."
Ask the StoryBots,"Ah come on, he should be in something good instead"
Ask the StoryBots,Ugh hes so much better than the MCU. That shit is career suicide now.
Ask the StoryBots,ok. so?
Ask the StoryBots,Trendy actor gets asked to be on trendy show? What a surprise
Ask the StoryBots,"they going to cake him in make up to hide the fact he's an asian man or have him play the token gay asian man who cracks jokes?

or maybe have him be some white male heroes asian girlfriends evil dad.

which is it"
Ask the StoryBots,"I have a better idea...

Don't make a Loki Season 2"
Ask the StoryBots,[removed]
Ask the StoryBots,When u can graciously flex. That’s another flex in itself
Ask the StoryBots,LOVE!!!!
Ask the StoryBots,Guy’s going to be typecast as a multiverse kid
Ask the StoryBots,He will be the hero Insectoid and fight crime with this Punchers of Pow
Ask the StoryBots,I would like that only if he plays his character from goonies but obviously now as an adult. He could be an Asian Tony Stark lol
Ask the StoryBots,"Listen here a check for $10 million dollars .
Sure sounds like a great project."
Ask the StoryBots,"Short round got BIG bois, congrats to this guy on his success."
Ask the StoryBots,Ohhh you mean Data from Goonies
Ask the StoryBots,"“Okie dokie, Kevin Feige, hold on to your potatoes.” 🧢"
Ask the StoryBots,"I wonder who hes going to be starring as, tho since Kang and the Multiverse is involved is really is anybodys guess on that."
Ask the StoryBots,Time travellers might be visiting us even know. You want to meet one? Try r/secrethostsociety
Ask the StoryBots,Love that movie. I think he was amaIng
Ask the StoryBots,"> Personally Asked Him to Join the  
  
What is this - /r/titlegore ?"
Ask the StoryBots,YAY !!!
Ask the StoryBots,"so, asian loki ?"
Ask the StoryBots,"I hate these kinds of spoilers, because it takes away any surprise I would've had watching the show. It's not a huge deal, but it was nice back when there were only like 2 actors on the cover of the movie and the rest of the cast was a bit of a mystery unless you read through the entirety of the credits."
EDEN OF THE EAST,"Agreed, great opening! I watched this on Netflix a few years ago and the song used in the opening is completely different, so I've always been partial to that one, but still think they're both great. Also, Eden of the East's closing credits are great!

And the show kinda rocks, too ;)"
EDEN OF THE EAST,"Meh.  Well that was underwhelming.  If you want a good OP sequence, try ""Paranoia Agent,"" ""Cowboy Bebop,"" or the second season of ""Death Note."" "
EDEN OF THE EAST,"So this is an anime movie and not a series?  I just added Paradise Lost to my queue, is there something else I should watch first for the sake of continuity?"
EDEN OF THE EAST,It's an 11 episode series followed by a few movies. Watch the series first.
EDEN OF THE EAST,It's a series. Watch it first before you watch the movies!
EDEN OF THE EAST,"Seems strange to frame Cathy as the star of East of Eden, but it sounds promising!"
EDEN OF THE EAST,"In what warped planet is Cathy an anti-hero?

The book outright describes her as so evil and so do her actions."
EDEN OF THE EAST,"I’m super concerned by using the phrase “antihero” to describe Cathy. This is not the character to reframe in some sort of feminist reclamation. She’s a horrible, broken sociopath. Fascinating, compelling, all that stuff. But not an antihero. Florence would be great in the role but I’m scared of this now."
EDEN OF THE EAST,I have a feeling we'll get more John Steinbeck adaptations as economic conditions worsen.  I bet a lot of properties from the 20s will be modernized
EDEN OF THE EAST,"I truly hope this will be good, east of eden is one of the best novels ever written as far as i am concerned, doing that justice isn't easy.  
I'd rather see it at HBO, but hopefully netflix is trying to truly make prestige tv here."
EDEN OF THE EAST,I can't think of a book I'm more protective of mentally than east of eden cause the characters are just so good and vivid. Can't help myself but be cautious but I'm remaining positive
EDEN OF THE EAST,I will actually watch anything with Florence Pugh at this point. She’s got so many interesting projects coming up.
EDEN OF THE EAST,"Zoe Kazan is writing and producing:

>The limited series adaptation of John Steinbeck’s epic novel will explore themes of trauma and repair; love and betrayal; duty and free will. The series will sketch an intimate portrait of the Trask family against the backdrop of huge historical forces — or, as Steinbeck put it, “the story of my country and the story of me.”

Kazan's grandfather Elia directed the original 1955 movie."
EDEN OF THE EAST,East of Eden is one of my all-time favourites and Pugh is a fantastic actress but...Cathy Ames as an anti-hero? Really? She was out and out evil.
EDEN OF THE EAST,I didn't know that Zoe Kazan wrote *Wildlife* - that movie's fantastic.
EDEN OF THE EAST,"I've got the book collecting dust, I really should give it a read this summer."
EDEN OF THE EAST,[deleted]
EDEN OF THE EAST,Curious who will play Lee
EDEN OF THE EAST,Florence Pugh is a part of so many projects I’m excited for.
EDEN OF THE EAST,"If you'd asked me to guess which of these two women in the thumbnail is twelve years older than the other, I would have guessed wrong"
EDEN OF THE EAST,Please film on location! Salinas valley
EDEN OF THE EAST,Florence Pugh is one of those actors that I'll watch anything she's in so this is now on my radar.
EDEN OF THE EAST,"I'm not the biggest fan of Pugh (she is a good actress), but when I saw this news my instant thought was she'd actually be a perfect fit for the character. She has had a few roles already where her character was cold/rude/kinda stuck up and entitled, yet you don't outright hate them. 

It's a wonderful novel and am looking forward to this adaptation. Nothing will ever be able to hold a candle to Steinbeck's words, but it will be interesting to see how she presents the story."
EDEN OF THE EAST,"Florence Pugh once drank six cuppas in an hour or so, my ideal girl"
EDEN OF THE EAST,Is this finally happening?
EDEN OF THE EAST,[removed]
EDEN OF THE EAST,damn! east of eden has already been filmed before. Do west of eden instead.
EDEN OF THE EAST,She’s a good actress but I wonder if she got her big break because she’s dating someone 20 years older than her who’s directed and produced movies (Zach Braff).
EDEN OF THE EAST,Well that sounds wonderful honestly
EDEN OF THE EAST,"Damn, now I have to finish the book lol."
EDEN OF THE EAST,"Everyone has that friend or family member of the group that's supposed to bring drinks for a potluck and then don't show up, so you're left just eating glizzies dry. Eventually, you learn not to count on them and just let yourself be pleasantly surprised when they actually show up for a change. 

That's Netflix now."
EDEN OF THE EAST,"I think Pugh's an excellent casting choice for Cathy- honestly if you gave me an hour and a list of A listers and asked me to cast her, she'd probably be my pick in terms of her overall ability and affect (though probably she should be physically more waifish- but that's not as big an issue). 

That said, I agree with others who are stumped by the description of Cathy as an antihero. I'm hoping this doesn't turn into her getting some kind of deep emotional moment that's not in the book and that ruins her character."
EDEN OF THE EAST,"I love Florence Pugh as an actor but she's almost too ""likeable"" to play someone like Cathy (who's just pure evil and an absolute psychopath). 

Someone like Julia Garner or Jennifer Lawrence would've been great as her instead, as they both can really turn on that ""coldness"" and dettachment that are vital parts of Cathy's character imo."
EDEN OF THE EAST,Oh! That’s my favorite Steinbeck book! I’m excited.
EDEN OF THE EAST,Wow
EDEN OF THE EAST,My guess is because Cathy is such a showy character. A few years ago they were going to adapt it with Jennifer Lawrence as Cathy. I just hope they stick to Cathy being evil and don't soften her up too much just because they have a big name attached to play her. Her being a monster is key.
EDEN OF THE EAST,"I agree. East of Eden is one of my favorites, and it seems really strange to frame Cathy as an anti-hero unless they were to make serious changes to the story. Which isn’t a bad thing if done well but rarely is"
EDEN OF THE EAST,"Well she is a very intriguing character and part of the very core of it.  
I hope this will be good, one of the best novels i've read."
EDEN OF THE EAST,"Yeah that was a strange choice of words on Zoe Kazan's part. Antiheroes usually have some sort of redeeming qualities, and Cathy Ames from the book didn't really have any, to my recollection. Cathy was straight-up evil."
EDEN OF THE EAST,Yeah what the hell is she on about. Makes me nervous for this adaptation just from that sentence alone.
EDEN OF THE EAST,"That one word in the article really soured me on this. Book adaptations usually live or die based on how well the writer and director understand the source material.

For a great example, there's a video where Villeneuve describes his direction of the Gom Jabbar scene in *Dune*. He very clearly understands the scene at a high level, and every single filmmaking decision was informed by what made the scene work in the book.

If Zoe Kazan sees Cathy as any sort of antihero, she severely misinterpreted the book. Even if she first read it as a teenager, she should have known better back then.

Best case is that Kazan either confused on what an ""antihero"" is or she's being misleading because the word ""antihero"" will rope people in who are unfamiliar with the book."
EDEN OF THE EAST,"There’s nothing heroic about her. In the book it’s pretty clear she’s evil, she talks about moving back east and making a man fall in love with her then deliberately driving him to suicide so she can inherit all his money."
EDEN OF THE EAST,"to be honest, I rarely see the term ""anti-hero"" used correctly."
EDEN OF THE EAST,Antihero is used to describe lots of shitty people who we nonetheless get to know intimately as main character. Hell people have used Patrick Bateman as an example of antihero.
EDEN OF THE EAST,"I googled the definition of antihero and don't see the issue? All the definitions I could find were very similar, is there another definition?

antihero: a central character in a story, movie, or drama who lacks conventional heroic attributes"
EDEN OF THE EAST,"You’re supposed to view her as evil from the male gaze of that time but really she escapes the men who dominate her life, and uses their own immorality against them with the brothel. She’s not a part of the Cain and Abel duality because she doesn’t follow a binary morality."
EDEN OF THE EAST,Yikes sweaty. You need to reframe your internalized misogyny. Steinbeck was a cis white man and therefore is the true evil.
EDEN OF THE EAST,we are getting napoleon and nosferatu movies soon as well
EDEN OF THE EAST,I’ve always thought *The Grapes of Wrath* would be perfect material for a Martin Scorsese x Leonardo DiCaprio x Robert De Niro collab.
EDEN OF THE EAST,Hell yea! I love his work. The old movies didn’t do it justice for me
EDEN OF THE EAST,"I know people love to give Netflix shit on here, but their limited series are usually pretty good."
EDEN OF THE EAST,"This is my thought. If you’re going to try to adapt a novel with such scope, so much depth and so many layers… You better invest an absolute fuckton in the writing and direction. That will be infinitely more important than whoever is acting in it. This casting tells me they probably have it backwards and makes me think it’s a cashgrab. I’d love to be wrong, though."
EDEN OF THE EAST,Honestly I think it’ll be extremely difficult to adapt this in a way that’s satisfying to fans of the book. At least they are making it a series and not a movie
EDEN OF THE EAST,"Same. And it has one of my favorite lines: “The chowder had blown both ways…”

Of all the beautiful phrases Steinbeck has strung together, the one that stuck most in my brain involved vomit and diarrhea."
EDEN OF THE EAST,Lol see you at the Puss in Boots 2 screening 😂
EDEN OF THE EAST,Same here. She has quickly become one of my favorite actors.
EDEN OF THE EAST,"She was horribly miscast in ""The Little Dummer Girl"". But I liked her in a lot of other stuff."
EDEN OF THE EAST,"> The series will sketch an intimate portrait of the Trask family

Shoud say Trask and Hamilton families. 

Samuel Hamilton (and Lee) is the beating heart of East of Eden."
EDEN OF THE EAST,"
>Kazan's father Elia directed the original 1955 movie.

Wow that's a really interesting fact"
EDEN OF THE EAST,"It's one of my favorite books of all time. I left it on my bookshelf for over a year because I had heard how good it was and was apprehensive of reading one of the best books ever written (never meet your heroes, right?).

I'm so glad I finally read it. It's not perfect, but it was incredible."
EDEN OF THE EAST,Yes you should. It’s a great story in every way.
EDEN OF THE EAST,There was a 1981 TV miniseries version with Jane Seymour as well.
EDEN OF THE EAST,She also ate a *lot* of hot sauce on *Hawkeye*.
EDEN OF THE EAST,She's a tea head is she?
EDEN OF THE EAST,"If you click on the picture, it is a link which will take you to the original article."
EDEN OF THE EAST,"She's been more relevent than Braff since before they started dating, if anything she kept his name in people's minds."
EDEN OF THE EAST,[deleted]
EDEN OF THE EAST,"Lady McBeth as Katherine was a murdering lunatic , Yelana Belova was the likeable psycho"
EDEN OF THE EAST,"In 1981, Jane Seymour played Cathy in the tv mini-series. She was the star and Cathy was still very rotten. [East of Eden (1981)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0083409/?ref_=vp_close)"
EDEN OF THE EAST,"Agree! But someone like Jennifer Lawrence would be perfect I think. Insanely attractive, to the point you’d accept the crazy and end up with your house burnt down and almost be okay with it."
EDEN OF THE EAST,She is baited as anti hero early in the book but never ends up being one. Maybe this is what they're going for.
EDEN OF THE EAST,"because any female characters can't be complete putrid beings like book Cathy these days, they have to have a reason, which usually can be traced back to abusive white men; worst form of feminism imaginable"
EDEN OF THE EAST,They made another Dune movie???
EDEN OF THE EAST,"Right, but the definition implies that an antihero is *still* a hero, albeit one who lacks the conventional attributes. Cathy is not a hero in any sense - she’s just evil for evil’s sake."
EDEN OF THE EAST,"Respectfully, I don’t agree that this was Steinbeck’s intention or an accurate modern interpretation of the character. Cathy, simply put, is evil. She enjoys evil for evil’s sake; she enjoys manipulating and hurting people, sometimes for profit but mostly because it’s enjoyable for her. 

She’s akin to a psychopath. She’s not evil because “hurt people hurt people”; she’s evil in the biblical sense. She’s representative of the bible’s snake-like Satan: “and when she swallowed, her little tongue flicked around her lips”."
EDEN OF THE EAST,"You clearly have no idea what happened in the story. Cathy is totally amoral. She's not some angel of justice. She killed her own mother just because it was easier than leaving her alive.

The book is extremely explicit over and over again that Cathy is missing that essential part of humanity that allows one to feel empathy for another person. I genuinely don't know how you could have read the book (if you did) and reached your interpretation."
EDEN OF THE EAST,Woah
EDEN OF THE EAST,Didn't the Nosferatu movie get cancelled? The Robert Eggers one
EDEN OF THE EAST,"It's not that i wanna shit on netflix, but in my eyes netflix isn't really known for its prestige tv per se, series which are the best one can watch. HBO is though.  
And for this novel, that is exactly what one needs in my eyes."
EDEN OF THE EAST,"It needs Cary Fukunaga directing. His period work in Jane Eyre, Beasts of No Nation, and True Detective S1 is unparalleled, and he’d probably welcome the chance to work on a more intimate project before the Broccolis inevitably ask him to come back for the Bond reboot."
EDEN OF THE EAST,"Yeah I’ll be there, it looks fun! I’m not sure if your being sarcastic or not, but if you aren’t, I hope you enjoy it too!"
EDEN OF THE EAST,I saw the first movie having a bad trip on shrooms. It was ok
EDEN OF THE EAST,She was incredible in LDG
EDEN OF THE EAST,Why was she miscast? I thought she did well in a complex role.
EDEN OF THE EAST,Did you watch the show before or after she blew up? I think she was great for the role. The casting director of that show also did Dune and The Lobster among other great shows and movies.
EDEN OF THE EAST,"Samuel and Lee were two of the best characters I’ve ever read. Of course, the majority of the characters are very well put together but there’s something about Samuel and Lee that makes me feel at ease. Like everything’s going to be okay."
EDEN OF THE EAST,Samuel is maybe my favorite character in all of literature.
EDEN OF THE EAST,Wait til you hear about how he named names to the house for unAmerican activities and then directed on the waterfront to rub it in.
EDEN OF THE EAST,"I mean, he was a very successful director and she has a spot in the door because of him"
EDEN OF THE EAST,I've heard pretty good things though I'm going in blind. I've had it for almost a year it seems like but I'd love to get it read before the adaptation so I can visualize things myself without influence.
EDEN OF THE EAST,"Yorkshire Tea gave her, her own box with Flo's Tea on it"
EDEN OF THE EAST,I feel like Reddit has a crush on her the same way they did JLaw and will turn on her when she makes a wrong move. People like Harvey Weinstein all but confirmed the existence of the casting couch trope. It’s not a stretch of the imagination to say that her partner helped her along the way.
EDEN OF THE EAST,"I remember watching that as a little kid with my parents.  Probably, not the best thing for a child to watch.

Oh Jane.."
EDEN OF THE EAST,I recently read it and pictured Cathy as Emma Stone.
EDEN OF THE EAST,"I just read the book for the first time a couple of months ago, and I completely disagree that she was ever set up as an anti-hero. She was clearly psychotic and selfish from the outset with no redeeming qualities. Book spoilers: >!One of her first actions in the book is to ruin the lives of two young boys, then she drove a teacher to suicide and then committed premediated murder of her parents just because her dad beat her once after she ran away.!<

There is some discussion in the book about how she must see everyone else as monsters just like we see her as one, but that's meant to give us better insight into her mental state, not to make us see her as heroic. I'm actually shocked to see your interpretation."
EDEN OF THE EAST,The book explicitly calls her out as irredeemably evil within like 1 page of her introduction.
EDEN OF THE EAST,"Let's not assume the worst, we haven't seen it yet, but it's certainly possible. But then i can't wait to see all video essays roasting it."
EDEN OF THE EAST,"I ultimately disagree with the form of this statement but do concede that they will probably forgo what I remember being an amazing villain from this book for the sake of making her more delectably likable. I don’t think she’s an antihero although I admit it’s been a decade since I’ve read the novel. Sometimes I feel like creators that are white women have a hard time realizing white women have the potential to be evil, manipulative, masochistic, and greedy. I can’t speak to feminism at all, I feel like it’s not my area of expertise by any measure, and I don’t want to over-speculate because I could very well be wrong, but I hope they give us a great villain or if they do go the other route they at least make the story and character riveting without excessively victimizing her."
EDEN OF THE EAST,You are just hearing about this now? Florence Pugh was even recently cast in Part 2
EDEN OF THE EAST,he is still working on it apparently
Beat Bugs,Can't wait for the Revolution 9 episode!
Beat Bugs,Storybots are amazing as well. My son and I are totally obsessed.
Beat Bugs,"Oh shit, you may have just broken the pepper pig addiction! Thank you!"
Beat Bugs,849 year old here. Watching and loving.
Beat Bugs,I'm a loser- corden?
Beat Bugs,"I am a grown ass not sober woman who's 26th birthday is in 47 minutes and I'm now watching this. Thanks. 

Edit: More people have told me happy birthday on reddit than on my Facebook. Thank yall :)"
Beat Bugs,"Nothing like getting your kids to walk around singing ""Why don't we do it in the Road."""
Beat Bugs,My 4 year old loves it and is constantly singing Beatles songs. Makes me feel like the coolest dad in the supermarket.
Beat Bugs,"I turned this on for my 20 month old daughter this morning...she *never* sits still, seeing as how she's a toddler. I turned this (brilliance) on and she was in a trance for a good 30-45 minutes. I have now binged watched the **entire** 2 seasons available--alone."
Beat Bugs,/r/frankocean knows the beat bugs too well
Beat Bugs,Boys Do Cry....
Beat Bugs,"Yeah, saw that a while ago on Netflix. Those adorable well designed characters lured me into watching it despite not being a big beatles fan, I really love those loveable critters. Children of all ages I'd say.
"
Beat Bugs,"I just heard an Of Monsters and Men cover of Eleanor Rigby and I think it was from this show. It sounded kind of great, so I'm interested in seeing more of this show!"
Beat Bugs,"Be aware that many of the songs are covered by famous artists as well.  The Shins, Eddie Vedder, Rod Stewart, James Bay, Chris Cornell, Regina Spektor, and more. "
Beat Bugs,"I read it wrong and thought it said ""music inspired by the Beastie Boys."""
Beat Bugs,31 year old male here. Ready to binge watch the shit out of this. Is that bad?
Beat Bugs,"Shout out to Peep and the Big Wide World. 

I frequently quote Quack and I'm 30."
Beat Bugs,Sounds interesting... oh wait. I'm in Australia. Never mind.
Beat Bugs,Everyone complaining about Paw Patrol and Caillou and whatever else obviously hasn't had to watch Canimals.....that shit is the worst thing that has ever been aired...
Beat Bugs,Another great show on Netflix is Puffin Rock. My daughter is absolutely enthralled with it. She's two. There is a side narrator in the show that makes small remarks and is never acknowledged by the characters but for some reason his comments are funny and very informative. Highly recommend it.
Beat Bugs,I can't wait in 50 years for the children's show Bey Hive or The Adelephants. :P
Beat Bugs,"I'll have to check this one out.  I also HIGHLY recommend the show Daniel Tiger, loosely based on Mr Rogers and helped teach my kids awesome short jingles to help with everyday stuff, like how to deal with being frustrated, or what to do when you have to go potty, etc.  

Singing: ""If you have to go potty stop, and go right away.  Flush and wash and be on your way!""

Or

Singing: ""When you're feeling frustrated, take a step back, and ask for help!""

There's tons of helpful short jingles and they totally got stuck in my 3 year old's head (in the best way).

Seriously, Daniel Tiger is a must-watch show for toddlers 18 months or older (or any age really).  Both my girls watch it, my oldest (almost 4) learned a TON of really great stuff and it's actually helpful for adults too, she reminds us what to do when we are frustrating or if we need help with something.  :)  "
Beat Bugs,"I got both my girls hooked on the Beatles (2&5) in utero. Brainwashed em all the way. We watch the movies regularly. This show is great.

 They definitely got my taste in music. Every ride in the car starts with Help then they're either asking for the Who, Talking Heads, the Kinks or my 5yo demands 311. (311 wtf?)"
Beat Bugs,She'd probably love Wings as well.
Beat Bugs,[deleted]
Beat Bugs,"While my daughter loves it, I hate this show. The songs are shoehorned in and usually have little relevance to what the little assholes are doing. "
Beat Bugs,I watch this alone
Beat Bugs,Little Einsteins was about to break my soul. Thank you. 
Beat Bugs,"Kids? Shit, I just queued this up for myself. "
Beat Bugs,Yo. You may have saved me from the depths of the Mickey Mouse Crackhouse. Gonna try this with my twins today. 
Beat Bugs,"God i hate this show. 

Its Octonauts or GTFO. "
Beat Bugs,GTF in there. No more twirly-woos. Cracks open vodka at 9am
Beat Bugs,"It's gonna be so sad when the diva one gets shot and people lament the loss of the most talented one,  before realising he was a bit of a dick all along. "
Beat Bugs,The Beatles are going to be ruined for this generation watching this. 
Beat Bugs,"Put it on for my 3 year old, he said to change it, and he does like classic rock. "
Beat Bugs,fuck everything about this
Beat Bugs,"Shit, I'm 22 and I would still watch this"
Beat Bugs,Yes! It is fantastic! I get the chills when they sing all you need is love 
Beat Bugs,These episodes are tops.  Cheers for the suggestion. 
Beat Bugs,"Little Einsteins is the worst. It's cool they had an educational show and wanted to teach the art, but Annie might be the worst singer I've ever heard. And she is their main singer.  "
Beat Bugs,"Easy to zone into these kids shows with your kids.
You have me singing the theme songs more than they would."
Beat Bugs,"Thank you for bringing this to my attention, I'll be sure to force my son to watch it tomorrow! "
Beat Bugs,THANK GOD for the new episodes. We're going on 2 months of watching this daily with my 2 year old. So happy I saw this thread lol
Beat Bugs,I've been looking for an excuse to play Beatles music to my daycare kids!! Thanks for this!!
Beat Bugs,"I have a one year old who will ignore everyone and everything when this show is on. He's been that way since the show first aired a few months ago, thank god for season two."
Beat Bugs,This is the most brilliant idea ever.
Beat Bugs,"If you like song based stuff like this I'd recommend to watch  ""Peg + Cat"" with you kids, As an adult I sort of enjoy the show myself when I watch it with my kids and it has a lot good parody songs within it and a few backround jokes for adults"
Beat Bugs,Amazing 
Beat Bugs,Can confirm. Have a 4 year old who totally loves The Beatles because of this show. Kids TV is generally terrible. It's so nice to have something like this to watch with them. 
Beat Bugs,"That looks excellent, and I'm going to get my grandkids into that."
Beat Bugs,"thats awesome, its a win-win, kid is happy watching show, your happy with beatles music and if they get addicted atleast its beatles music they are singing and not some horrible song"
Beat Bugs,"Now playing. My boy (2) still can't understand the show but I'm sure he will. 

Thanks for the suggestion OP. "
Beat Bugs,My 3 year old son watches beat bugs all the time
Beat Bugs,"Can confirm, My three year old daughter loves Penny Lane."
Beat Bugs,"Sure that's not a good cover, but this is a delivery vector for excellent 60's music to a young generation, and that's a 100% positive in my book."
Beat Bugs,"Hey OP, THANK YOU !!!!!  "
Beat Bugs,"We watched this series a few weeks ago! I loved it. I love the Beatles, it was fun to see a show based around their songs, no matter how crazy some of them are. Haha"
Beat Bugs,"Hey, my daughter is also 3 and named after a Beatles song. I know what we're watching tomorrow!"
Beat Bugs,"As a thirty five year old father of a two year old and an eight year old, who is going through tough times, you have just helped immensely. Thank you"
Beat Bugs,Buy the soundtrack for the car too. Incredibly well produced with a lot of big names performing. 
Beat Bugs,"22 month old son and me a 34 year old dad.. dancing in the living room. Most definitely our new favourite show! 

Thank You OP! "
Beat Bugs,OMG thank you! I've been trying to find a music-heavy show for my 20 month old that would not drive me insane!
Beat Bugs,Wow the prodduction quality of this is amazing!
Beat Bugs,Even I liked this show. The animation is great.
Beat Bugs,Thank you so much!! My daughter loves it! If I had to watch one more episode of toopy and binoo I'd loose it!!! This show is actually good for me and her. Again thank you!! 
Beat Bugs,"Weird. I don't see it anywhere on the Netflix front page for ""kids"". Horray for reddit. "
Beat Bugs,I miss when cartoons were enjoyable for parents as well.
Beat Bugs,Thank you for sharing! My 4 year old daughter loves singing and dancing so any show that incorporates music can easily win her heart. From a quick look (and listen) this show that won't make me crazy when she plays it on repeat! I may even sing along :)
Beat Bugs,My nephew didn't understand how I already knew the songs on his cartoon. So fun singing along with him. 
Beat Bugs,Oh this is just great. I hope there will be a Queen's version with the same concept.
Beat Bugs,My four-year-old also loves this show.  So of course I had to get out the Beatles vinyl and play it for him.  He was so excited about having Beat Bugs on the stereo!
Beat Bugs,Nice try Netflix. I'm already giving you my money.
Beat Bugs,I discovered this show about a month ago because my son loves bugs and so I typed bugs into the search and this show came up. I actually don't mind watching with him because I love the Beatles and he loves bugs..... Genius.
Beat Bugs,Some kids I babysat yesterday were watching this. I enjoyed it!
Beat Bugs,"Love it, not to mention Daniel Johns from Silverchair fame is in charge of all the re-arrangements.  Makes me love it all the more.

http://www.news.com.au/entertainment/music/reinventing-the-beatles-for-kids-show-beat-bugs-has-given-daniel-johns-a-new-lease-on-life-in-la/news-story/89d65faf98b1b614f47d4cf9fb27c1c9"
Beat Bugs,Does this show have all of the fights between John and Paul? That's some pretty brutal stuff...
Beat Bugs,/u/k47su
Beat Bugs,"That's nice, if you like cute forest animals,I also recommend you a show called [Happy tree friends](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/f0/a6/5e/f0a65eb8bd1e857f70484ad358724c0e.jpg)"
Beat Bugs,"Beatles covers make me cringe. Just play the originals. Suppose it's good to expose a new generation to The Beatles, I just hope they graduate to the real deal at some point because these are awful. "
Beat Bugs,aren't beatles songs mostly based on hardcore drugs?
Beat Bugs,No. Why can't you use the original music? Why?
Beat Bugs,So I immediately went to NETFLIX to add this to My List so I wouldn't forget about it. THANKS !
Beat Bugs,"I believe I seen that Eddie Vedder (Pearl Jam's lead) has a singing part. Or my be a character, not sure. I actually might check it out."
Beat Bugs,Interesting. I've seen this and I always skip it based on the fact that it's Beatles music. Maybe one of my kids will like it I guess. I'll try. I just loathe The Beatles. They need one based on ELO - now THAT would be sweet. 
Beat Bugs,Apple Music has a playlist
Beat Bugs,Yay! we love Beat bugs! The new season is on Netflix now.
Beat Bugs,"at r/frankocean, we would think otherwise.  "
Beat Bugs,"My god, the Beatles propaganda machine just NEVER stops promoting does it? "
Beat Bugs,[deleted]
Beat Bugs,Not for too young of children my two year old was scared of the whole bug zapper episode where the theme almost seemed like it was death 
Beat Bugs,Trying this out tomorrow! Barney's Day at the Farm is getting a little old..
Beat Bugs,Thanks!  Currently suffering through an Annoying Orange kick. 
Beat Bugs,"Hold him in your arms so you can feel his disease.

Who ever greenlit this show never actually listened to Beatles lyrics. "
Beat Bugs,More than this show I wanna see your daughter singing beatles songs while she walks around the house. Also I have a request: Love me do.
Beat Bugs,"Careful, the best way to ruin a song is to hear it repeatedly (especially if it wasn't done very well). ""Let it Go"" was pretty good, but when there's a kid who will start singing ""let it go"" (only that line, repeatedly) whenever you say those 3 words, it gets old quickly.

Then again, probably better they sing a good song rather than whatever crap they pick up on their own."
Beat Bugs,I wonder how the Maxwells Silver Hammer episode will go down.
Beat Bugs,I can't help but feel this is a high man's paradise.
Beat Bugs,"Damn, Netflix not available for me, anyone know where I can watch this?"
Beat Bugs,Two Words: Helter Skelter
Beat Bugs,Remember The Beatles? Oh I member...
Natural Born Monsters,"I agree, first 4-5 seasons were excellent. After that, it felt like they needed to keep increasing the intensity and made questionable decisions. This happens to many of these shows. 

The procedurals like Grey's Anatomy, NCIS, etc have it easier."
Natural Born Monsters,"I watched every single episode of this series until the end. To me, it started to go downhill the Leviathan season and what they did to my Bobby Singer. I'm loyal, but I'm honest. There were ups and downs after season 5, but truly, the worst thing they could have done was what they did to Bobby. Ingents."
Natural Born Monsters,"Yup. But I personally wouldn't have wanted it cancelled at season 5, cause we had some really banger episodes in later seasons (weekend at Bobby's comes to mind)  
 
So now whenever I do rewatches I go straight through 1-5, then start skipping around to the good stuff for the rest"
Natural Born Monsters,"The problem with the show in the later seasons is definitely the over reliance on goofy characters. In previous seasons, demons and angels were considered a threat and could be imposing. Then in the later seasons, they become ineffectual comic relief. Every side character becomes a goofy caricature with an over the top accent. The people they meet are cartoons for the most part and the acting is terrible. Sam and Dean also become a bit goofy as well, especially Sam, who’s acting method seems to be simply a large variety of facial ticks and stuttering grunts. Jensen Ackles has too much charisma to be too bad, he’s always watchable but for the most part he becomes a goofy guy as well. The beginning seasons have comedic moments that are pretty good and used sparingly, but they really lean into it in the later seasons and lose all the horror that the early seasons had."
Natural Born Monsters,Yes. I truly pretend season 6-15 never existed and just appreciate seasons 1-5 for what they are. It’s a great five season arc.
Natural Born Monsters,"I was kind of obsessed at the time, and really worried they would cancell it before the planned ending on season 5. 

Although, looking back, I think the introduction of angels took a lot of the original charm, it was really good TV"
Natural Born Monsters,"I definitely grew to miss that really dark aesthetic of the early seasons. I remember a later episode where they're with Rowena rounding up souls in this suburban Canadian neighborhood and it was *so bright* outside. Like distractingly so. 

(It was also one of the few episodes that was very obviously in Canada because the street signs were unlike any I'd seen in the US. But I digress)"
Natural Born Monsters,"They jumped so many sharks, they had to reuse sharks."
Natural Born Monsters,"The first season is rough. I love it, I have seen it several times, I can watch any episode but the first season is rough. Like Stargate SG-1 it takes time until it becomes a diamond."
Natural Born Monsters,"You are correct and there is a clear reason for all of what you said: Kripke only planned the series to be 5 seasons. This is why people call the season 5 finale the “original ending”. But with Supernatural being CW’s most successful show, CW wanted the show to continue. Kripke obliged but he also stepped down as showrunner, and other people took over running the show post season 5. So seasons 6-15 is basically just repetitive season arc’s of fan service, whereas seasons 1-5 had a serialized story that all tied together. The only good thing to come out of seasons 6-15 is >!the confirmation that Chuck is God!<, a lot of fans theorized it before, but if the show had ended after season 5 we never would’ve known for sure."
Natural Born Monsters,"It's a good example of how to transition from ""case of the week"" to overarching storyline in a seamless and exciting way. Still a B-show at best for me, but it was fun when I was a teenager! I never continued after season 5."
Natural Born Monsters,"With these long-running shows that went downhill in the end it can sometimes be easy to forget there was a time when they were excellent, and that's why they ran long in the first place. Looking at you Arrow."
Natural Born Monsters,I hate how they literally wrote in plot armor for them into the series.  It cheapened the whole series.
Natural Born Monsters,The series originally was only planned for 5 seasons.
Natural Born Monsters,"I always wish it had been cancelled after 5. It would have gone down as a great show, not hokey fan service. And maybe Jared wouldn’t have become so unbearable."
Natural Born Monsters,I know people love this show I just don't see it.
Natural Born Monsters,"I'm going through Supernatural now for the first time and I'm halfway through season 7 at the moment. I actually think season 6 is a contender for my favourite. Even though it's clear they juggled several plots that they struggled to interconnect, it has several of my favourite episodes of the whole shows, less Sam and Dean conflict (which was played out by that point anyway) and the best part: more Bobby. Bobby is far and away the best character in Supernatural, so having more of him was only a good thing. Season 7 is a noticeable downgrade.

There's a lot of season 1 and 2 that feels very simple, which is to be expected when you're starting a new show and building up a mythology. It's like early episodes of Buffy or The X-Files (and probably a dozen other shows), with the monster of the week format and finding out how to kill them. Kind of like a police procedural but with monsters. When they start to delve into heaven and hell, then I think it starts to hit its stride (Kurt Fuller is great). I'm a lot less interested when it's just constant brother drama.

The problem is that I don't really care about Sam and Dean (*especially* Dean) but some of the side characters are great. So far, I think the episodes and seasons focused on Bobby and Castiel are some of the best ones (which is why I like season 6 so much) and it's disappointing they didn't make the most of Ellen, Jo, Ash, Rufus and more."
Natural Born Monsters,"Is it ""extremely good""? Or is it ""extremely good for a CW show""? There's a big difference. I remember this sub telling me *The Arrow* was 'extremely good', which caused all confidence in that channel to be lost."
Natural Born Monsters,"More than 10 years since I watched those first 5 seasons and it's still a top favorite of mine.

Somewhere around season 10 was when I stopped watching it weekly. I caught up whenever I had a couple of episodes to binge. After 11 I didn't want to continue anymore. I started a rewatch during that hiatus and I was shocked to finally notice how far the quality had dropped with those later seasons.

After that I came across youtube clips here and there so I have a general idea what the last 4 seasons were like. I did watch the season 15 penultimate episode though and it was just complete garbage. The cgi was so bad the show looked like shit. It looked much better in the earlier seasons. And that was 15 years earlier!

I still watch Kripke's run every other year or so."
Natural Born Monsters,Agreed. The story was told by the end of Season 5. Personally I hated the angels and especially Castiel who was played by an extremely bad actor. He was okay in 4 and 5 but anything after that involving him or the angels was tedious to get through. It was so clearly not working anymore that they wrote him out at one point but ended up bringing him back because of the backlash from (I presume) viewers who thought he was hot.  Sam was a bad actor too but the chemistry with Dean helped offset his bad acting even though I think he actually got worse as the show went on. Supernatural was a great show for the first 5 seasons but the other seasons and focus on Castiel tarnished it.
Natural Born Monsters,"Yeah, there's a lot of good stories that could be told post-Season 5, but the post-Season 5 we got usually just did the worst possible version of each of those stories. Case in point, how do you go bigger than the devil? You could go with the living embodiment of chaos, the Leviathan. And post-Season 5 of Supernatural did that! ...But it wasn't just the one Leviathan, it was multiple leviathans, and they had nothing to do with the chaos dragon of lore or any sort of leviathan mythos really, instead just being virtually immortal versions of an enemy the brothers have already fought multiple times.

What gets me though is that Kripke was still writing on the show in Season 6. Yes, he was no longer the head writer, but he was still consulting, directly writing a couple of episodes, and was apparently okay with all of the lore inconsistencies and plot holes that Season 6 produced (unless he only had knowledge about the episodes he was working on and not any of the others).

Because of that and the low points of the Carver era, I think I would still be skeptical of a post-S5 new Kripke era even though those first five seasons were amazing."
Natural Born Monsters,"While I agree that 1-5 amazing, there were a few standalone seasons that were also very good. I think it's season 11 where they are trying to stop Gods sister, and that was a banger. A redeemed Metatron trying to convince Chuck not to give up on humanity is peak Supernatural.

Of course, then they completely ruin that excellence with the plot twist involving God in the last season.

I think the show had two perfect series finales, S5 and S11. The actual finale got ruined by COVID, so I'd cut them some slack if the rest of the season wasn't terrible."
Natural Born Monsters,"Money is a helluva drug. 

I pretty much tell anyone interested in the show “watch seasons 1 through 5, pause the last episode of season 5 at the end right when the camera is outside of the house, and pretend that’s where the series ended and 6-15 aren’t real.”"
Natural Born Monsters,Is it just me who feels supernatural and Smallville are bizarrely similar in later seasons??
Natural Born Monsters,"I would hardly call ""extremely good"", it was alright

the show was always B tier/CW silliness, especially after season 1"
Natural Born Monsters,"Extremely good?  I mean come on.  They are OK.  Its a good thing to have on in the background while you're doing something else.  Its B level quantity over quality television, which is fine.  There's nothing really outstanding about it.  Its entertaining enough, but the writing, acting, cinematography, are all pretty meh."
Natural Born Monsters,"It's difficult to recommend people to just watch 5 seasons out of a 15 season show on good faith. Yet new people will get a bit afraid seeing a 15 season show to pick up, specially one with so many episodes.

Loved those first 5 seasons and the whole 15 were good overall but gee, makes it difficult to recommend the show."
Natural Born Monsters,"It's actually 2 - 5.  Originally, the brothers weren't meant to continue.  It was going to be a anthology series at first. Their chemistry on screen is what made them stop telling a story about the world with these characters in it, and more about these characters interacting with the world.  Also the budget significantly increases in the second season.  If you watch the end of Season 1, it ends with a car crash with generic ass music playing on the radio.  Season 2 starts and its playing a licensed Ted Nugent song."
Natural Born Monsters,"It's a good YA show, but it doesn't hold up against other top TV shows. 

Swap Jensen Ackles and Jared Padalecki out for less attractive leads and the show loses a large portion of its female fanbase."
Natural Born Monsters,Wasn't Ben Edlund responsible for the show's uptick (ha!) In quality on seasons 2-5?
Natural Born Monsters,"There are a lot of good episodes in seasons 1-2, but I’ve always felt like the writers strike forcing a shorter season 3 was hugely beneficial. Made them cut out any filler and focus more on the larger plot.

Season 3 also gave us Ghostfacers, so on that alone it’s my favorite."
Natural Born Monsters,"Some good with a lot of meh is a perfect description of the seasons post Lucifer prophecy aka season 6 and onward. I honestly enjoy the over arcing narratives of each season, but wow are there a lot of 'skip' moments in each season/episode. Basically any time Sam and Dean start arguing and then later make up became instant skip scenes. At that point they served no narrative purpose beyond starting and episode with drama and ending the episode with a flimsy disagreement conclusion that set them back to their basic positions. 


As a side note, im still annoyed with how they built up Eve, made super monsters, and then just brushed it all away in about 5 minutes of scene time.


While I personally didnt like the final confrontation, I was fine with the finale/ send-off. But yes the first 5 seasons are quite good and season 5 is one that I occasionally go back to and watch again. Mark Pellegrino was a fantastic Lucifer for the earlier seasons."
Natural Born Monsters,I think there was a drop in quality after Eric Kripke left the show
Natural Born Monsters,"Just finished a full series rewatch myself and I was thinking the same thing about the back ten seasons, but at the same time I really respect them just for going for it yknow?

A lot of people say they hated the Leviathans but honestly that whole ""arc"" for lack of a better term is probably my favorite just because it was amazing to me that they actually managed to find a new villain after the massive shark jump that was lucifer

And although it started to get stale after awhile everytime they managed to pull a new bad guy out of their asses I was honestly floored

Like when Dean massacred the house of frankstein that was pretty dumb, and when there was that one episode about the monster families that run Chicago that never came up again, I was rolling my eyes at that pretty hard but just the charm of jumping the shark and then finding a larger shark to jump over never wore off on me"
Natural Born Monsters,"I put the writing of 1-5 of supernatural against any TV show, and it holds up.

I look at it as 6-15 is just a different show. 1-5 takes itself reasonably seriously, 6-15 is fun popcorn television."
Natural Born Monsters,"I think the only season I skipped in full was season 10. My least favourite choice in the show will always be the dragon copout, too."
Natural Born Monsters,"First 2 seasons were close to x-files ""monster of the week"". Then when we got close to the characters they added epic story."
Natural Born Monsters,End last ep of season 5 as it starts to pan away from Dean having a meal with his adopted family and it's perfect.
Natural Born Monsters,Dean telling Sam what he did while he was in hell is one of the best scenes in TV
Natural Born Monsters,"Agreed... and disagreed. As much as I love SPN season 1-5, I wouldn't say I like how the female characters in it were written. Save Bela. Bela was fucking awesome.

Then again I also don't like how the female characters are written in 6-15 so... Yeah, I really don't know how to feel about the whole show regarding that."
Natural Born Monsters,"Yeah Power creep, they beat the devil so the next baddie has to be more powerful, and then the next one, etc.

I still enjoy the later seasons for the monster-of-the-week episodes but almost all of the plotlines are weak."
Natural Born Monsters,"I used to go on the subreddit and speculate how certain seasons would wind up, and I was always wrong because they would just keep getting more and more ridiculous and then a bigger enemy would emerge in the last episode and one of the brothers would disappear. That show had so much potential for good stories but it became fanservice schlock."
Natural Born Monsters,"Near the end of the leviathan stuff is when I stopped, good to know I didn't miss out on anything."
Natural Born Monsters,And then they brought Bobby back! Not the same Bobby but still! I’m guessing they got a lot of backlash killing Bobby off (and the way they did it) and found a way to bring him back and thought everything would be square lol
Natural Born Monsters,"''The French Mistake'', ''Baby'' and ''ScoobyNatural''. Fantastic episodes."
Natural Born Monsters,Seasons 1-5 are the Winchester Gospel. Seasons 6-15 are the apocrypha.
Natural Born Monsters,"I actually didn't finish season 15. I got halfway through and gave up when I heard the ending had been horrible. I read the synopsis of the remaining episodes and it was just a weird way to end it. Having rewatched 1-5, it makes way more sense to stop there and pretend it actually ended there."
Natural Born Monsters,And one episode was called jump the shark.
Natural Born Monsters,"The problem with season one on streaming is that it’s the only season without the original music used in the show. So you’ll have moments of Dean rocking out to a rock song, but it’s the not the song that was originally in the show so they have to edit it weird."
Natural Born Monsters,"After a quick scroll on IMDB i'll give you Bloody Mary, Hook Man, Bugs and Route 666 but I think the rest are watchable to great, even something like The Benders sets up the trope of human enemies always being gross bastards. 18 outta 22 ain't bad."
Natural Born Monsters,Yeah it took a while for them to figure out the right balance of monster of the week with serialized story. As a whole it's good but you can pick it apart pretty easily episode by episode and ultimately the monster of the week stuff just falls short. The real redeeming factor of the show was that serialized story and you sat through the monster of the week to see the weekly 5 minutes of progression for the overarching plot.
Natural Born Monsters,"We went to a Supernatural fan panel at a convention. It was our first con and we thought it would be fun. I forget how my husband ended up with the mic, but he said, well we all know Chuck is God. 

Holy crap was the response not what I expected. Half the room cheered in agreement, the other half grumbled and there were a few boos. One of the panelists wanted to know what led him to believe that. It was obvious she disagreed, and a guy in the audience went on about how how was a Christian and Chuck being God would be disrespectful to Christianity. All I could think was, do you even watch the show?

It was realty wild to see so many people refuse to believe it, and then the big reveal happened. I really liked Chuck being God. Everything after with his character was uneven to downright disappointing."
Natural Born Monsters,The powerhouse they had at Thursday night I believe with Smallville leading into Supernatural made them a ton of money. It’s not surprising they would milk it even after the creators were out of story.
Natural Born Monsters,"And that is why they were the best seasons. Still one of the greatest shows in years in terms of music and art direction. 

I get so angry about the Sera Gamble seasons. Big bad talked about in first couple episodes then forgotten and defeated in the last 1-2 episodes. 

Carver wasn't too bad. 

I popped back for the Men of Letters season when Mary was brought back.

Edit to add: I feel bad for everyone who watched it later via streaming after the original music was stripped out. The classic rock used went with the story in most cases and when it was switched it didn't feel the same. I can only watch it on bluray at this point otherwise there is much rage."
Natural Born Monsters,"Honestly i disagree. While it obviously went downhill after season 5 we still got some amazing and fun episodes along the way up to season 15 that we would have missed. Like my all time favorite one ""The French Mistake"" in season 6. Just that episode alone makes Season 6 worth watching."
Natural Born Monsters,"Extremely good for a network TV show, not just CW. If you have issues with network TV, those issues are still present. If you don't, it's a fantastic time."
Natural Born Monsters,"You have a point, but I personally think it's just a solid show for any network (specifically season 1-5). There is a super cringe part of the fandom that overlaps with The Arrow fans that think that stuff was good. I gave The Arrow a shot after hearing the accolades and it was the most meh piece of TV. The latter years of SPN catered extremely hard to these cringe fans (where the early seasons actually made fun of them). I honestly think Twitter/Tumbler fandoms have ruined many shows because a show gets popular so creators turn to the internet to see what the fans are saying and the most hardcore ones are living there creating the absolute dumbest piece of fanfic possible with everyone praising it. 

The WB/CW was a good melodrama network for teens and young adults and then it turned into PG13 Nickelodeon shows."
Natural Born Monsters,"I think post-5 Kripke was collecting checks and helping the team transition without him. I mean they literally kill him in one episode. After that, he seemed to just get residuals and drop in every now and then. The writing was just terrible after he left though. I know he didn't personally write that many episodes in 1-5, but his showrunning direction must have been what kept things grounded and on a consistent course. 

He seems to be running the Boys like he did SPN and I think that's making people anxious. A big criticism of The Boys season 3 is that it ended just like it started and nothing really changed, just a lot of build up for nothing. To me that's exactly what happened in season 3 of SPN with Dean actually dying and going to hell. He seems to still write like he would for a network TV show instead of a streaming service, and he's said that he's planning to go to season 5 with the Boys. I think he's got good ideas and knows how to string stories along to keep them interesting until they can reach a final episode and come to a conclusion. I'd bet he'd be able to develop a well rounded epilogue to season 5 SPN if he got the chance."
Natural Born Monsters,"For me the only stand-out late season was 12, when the villains went from being angels and demons to just… the English. Such a weird choice but I enjoyed the change."
Natural Born Monsters,1000%
Natural Born Monsters,Probably cuz they reuse the same local Canadian actors.
Natural Born Monsters,"You gotta treat it like I did Arrow. It was a shame they canceled it after 2 seasons. I still have such rage over black canary in s3e1.

It's such a shame SPN got canceled after 5 seasons."
Natural Born Monsters,"You just have to explain to the people that you're recommending the show to that it's not really a 15 season show. It's more like a 5 season show with a 6 season sequel show which has its own 4 season sequel show. And the sequel shows just retained the title of the original show. But you can jump off at the end of Season 5, the end of Season 11, or the end of Season 15 and still get a full story."
Natural Born Monsters,I wouldn't call Bad Moon Rising by CCR generic ass music.
Natural Born Monsters,"I think the anthology series was an idea that got dropped before the pilot even shot. Kripke wanted the scary stories to be front and center with a couple of reporters going around capturing them, but when the studio disliked that he pitched the idea of them being brothers. I think he fleshed out a couple seasons at a time, waiting to see if they would be able to continue before writing any cliffhangers."
Natural Born Monsters,"Maybe. I followed Padiwhack over from Gilmore Girls. Mainly, I was there for the monster of the week with the supernatural twists. Horror is my bread and butter. 

Even better was the classic rock music. So much good music in those early seasons."
Natural Born Monsters,"Yea, and he stayed until season 8 but I think he worked better with Kripke there than when he wasn't."
Natural Born Monsters,"OMFG, I swear it's because Sera Gamble forgot who her big bad for that season was. So much potential just forgotten."
Natural Born Monsters,"I've never really understood this criticism about the female characters. I understand that many times there was a ""damsel in distress"" type character week to week that Dean usually hit on (especially in the early episodes), but they never seemed purposefully written to be a bad stereotype and his advances were usually batted down and he was made to look like a fool.

Jo and Ellen showed up early in the series and appeared a number of times. Each time they held their own against the bad guys and all of the male characters seemed to respect them.

Ruby and Meg were both demons and did demon things and it never seemed like they were written poorly (just maybe acted poorly at times).

Sheriff Jody Mills helps defeat the bad guy after her family was killed.

Bela was well written and beat the guys quite a bit.

These were all season 5 and earlier characters. I think the overall issue is that there wasn't a prominent female character that lasted a long time. Most of them showed up every now and then, but not like Bobby, Crowley, and Castiel who were often in episode after episode. There's only so much room for the regular cast and they'd already settled into a very male-centric show. Two brothers + dad, then two brothers + Bobby, then two brothers + Bobby and a male angel, then two brothers + Bobby and a male angel and a male demon. They seemed to try to rectify this with Rowena and Mary later on, but those episodes were already meh. The crux of the matter is that the show started off as very hetero-focused with Dean being a womanizer. So any woman that was introduced was already being ogled at by one of the main characters. Dean even sleeps with an angel in one episode and Sam sleeps with a werewolf in another episode. The early seasons had women showing up who would eventually swoon for the main characters, except for the ones I listed above. So I think instead of bucking that trend, they just didn't put effort into casting a series regular woman in any role."
Natural Born Monsters,"I loved the series throughout the entire run, but the power creep was pretty hilarious.

They kill literal death, and eventually they kill the actual omniscient omnipresent God, despite having no actual powers. 

Puts DBZ to shame."
Natural Born Monsters,"Until eventually they literally killed Death, Lucifer, and even God. It got pretty silly (I still enjoyed the later seasons, but I also know they were ridiculous and not as good as the beginning)"

Natural Born Monsters,"Yeah, that's when I called it quits as well. The leviathans were hyped up so much, then were completely depowered by the end of the season. The first red flag was when they pulled that same shit with Castiel already."

Natural Born Monsters,Rob Benedict confirmed that Chuck is God back in 2011 at a convention. He even said that Kripke and other writers/producers asked him how it felt to play God.
Natural Born Monsters,"Season 11 had Metatron call Chuck God's meatsuit and that the nebbishness of his personality belonged to Chuck, not God. To me that leaves the door open to either interpretation.

Either:

1) At the beginning of time God knew how everything in the future would play out, knew when the apocalypse would be triggered, and created his angels with the name of a ""prophet"" on the inside of their eyelids that he always knew he would disguise himself as one day. Then when it came time for that ""prophet"" to be born, he paused the prophet-creation mechanic so that no new prophet would be born during Chuck's lifetime, blinded the archangel who was assigned to watch Chuck so that he wouldn't see that God was letting himself be born as Chuck (or came into being as an adult Chuck and simply rewrote Raphael's memories so that he didn't realize he never watched Chuck being born and growing up). And then he pretended to have headaches to pass himself off as a prophet. Then after Raphael had died, he continued pretending to have headaches when no one was around to see him simply because he had gotten that into the character of Chuck. He then left Earth for a while and restarted the prophet-creation mechanic. Then he returned to Earth, had sex with some of his creations that he considers his children, eventually talked to Metatron, and through his conversation with Metatron decided that he wanted to be a writer who told the truth. So he helped the brothers defeat Amara (but possibly lied about Gabriel's death), and then left Earth with her for a while. Then he came back to Earth and decided he instead wanted to be a writer who lies in order to be the best writer of all time. He cooked up ways to torture the brothers, but even though he was able to foresee the apocalypse at the beginning of time, he couldn't foresee the brothers' plans to defeat him. And then the brothers left him alive even though he still has all of his knowledge of magic and powered-artifacts that would let him return as a threat in the future.

or

2) Chuck was an actual human prophet that was born to human parents. His name was written on the inside of the angels' eyelids from the beginning of time. He helped the brothers, and in the Season 5 finale God began using him as a vessel. God began taking on Chuck's memories as his own and pretending that Chuck's experiences were his experiences. When Metatron confronted him about this charade, he led God to the conclusion that he didn't want to be Chuck anymore, he wanted to be a writer who told the truth. So he helped the brothers defeat Amara and then merged with her at the end of Season 11. God's light softened Amara, allowing her to appreciate creation, but Amara's darkness corrupted Chuck, feeding his ego and narcissism, and allowed Chuck to gain control of God and his powers. So now instead of God pretending to be Chuck, it was Chuck pretending to be God. And Chuck had no qualms about being a writer who lies if it meant he would be recognized as the greatest writer ever. But because Chuck isn't God, he didn't have full access to all of God's powers. He wasn't able to see how the brothers would defeat him. And once he was defeated, he didn't have God's knowledge of magic or artifacts that would allow him to become a threat to the brothers ever again.

Personally I think the second option makes more sense and gives the story a better conclusion, but I think people are welcome to go with the first interpretation if they choose.

That said, Kripke confirmed that Chuck wasn't always planned to be God. They were still trying to figure out how they wanted to portray God when they were writing the back half of Season 5, and Kripke confirmed that God hadn't appeared in the show yet at that time even though Chuck had appeared in Season 4 and three episodes of Season 5."

>Jo and Ellen showed up early in the series and appeared a number of times. Each time they held their own against the bad guys and all of the male characters seemed to respect them.


In what sort of ways do you say they held their own?

Jo's first appearance was good but she didn't face off against any bad guys. Jo's second appearance had her kidnapped before Dean and Sam save her. Then she agrees to use herself as bait while the our two heroes trap him in a ring of salt. Third appearance has Meg tie her up and continually harrass her before Dean saves her. The only thing she does in the episode is save him from drowning but that's about it. Fourth appearance has War making her think a demon entered her mother and finally, she shows some combat skills, but she doesn't end up using them against any bad guys. 

And finally, fifth appearance has her finally showing that she's all grown by... once again using herself as bait and Sam and Dean go to steal the colt back from Crowley. Now, she does end up saving Dean but she never manages to kill either of those two dogs, her mother did. She may have been the one who gave the idea of having them blow up the shop while Sam and Dean leave but that's way too late and it was while on her deathbed.

Jo's whole arc is that she wants her mother to see her as a full fledged hunter. As someone who can take care of herself without her mother needing to babying her. But we don't get any sort of acknowledgment from her.

Ellen isn't any better. Good first appearance but no bad guys. Second appearance has her decide to go with Bobby, Sam and Dean before Jake Tally decides to use her as a hostage make her turn her gun to her head. She's does end up helping Bobby close the gate of hell but that's about all she does in that episode. Third appeareance has her being held down by her own daughter and after she managed to overpower her, she runs back to storage and leaves Sam with Jo and Rufus.

 And then there's her final episode. She may have been the one to take out the dogs but it was too late.

>Ruby and Meg were both demons and did demon things and it never seemed like they were written poorly (just maybe acted poorly at times).

 I'm not so sure about that. Yes, they were fine. But when you compare them to someone like Crowley, especially Ruby, it becomes clear that they only had one goal in mind. They never seemed to be fleshed out like he was.

Meg 1 and Meg 2 were fine.

Speaking of the demoness(es?), one thing I've noticed is that whenever a(male) demon is shown to be tortured, that almost always have their clothes on and mostly shown bloody and beaten. However, when Ruby is held by Alastair, she is shown naked with only a metal bar covering her nipples, much is the same way with Meg.

Jody and Bella were fine, I guess.

Female (recurring) characters you have mentioned from kripke era:

>Becky

A caricature of an obsessive fangirl. There's nothing nice to say about her.

>Anna

Man, did she get shafted soooo badly. I'm fully well aware of her potential and that her role was taken by Castiel because he was the fan's favorite but if there's any female character that was poorly written, it's her.

There was a post on SPN subreddit that explained what was wrong with what they had done to her. Here it is.

https://www.reddit.com/r/Supernatural/comments/101mfyo/anna_was_done_so_wrong_on_this_show/

>Lisa

She is there to primarily suit Dean's needs after what happened to Sam. As opposed to all the other love interests, she is not fleshed out well enough. Main thing out her is that she has a son named Ben, who's probably Dean's, had a one night stand with Dean and that's about it. Heck, we're supposed to believe he fell in love with her but we barely know anything about her. 

I don't mind having love interests but the fact that they're there primarily to suit them, never having their own arcs and struggles and even if they did, they just  aren't as complex as the other recurring characters were at when they were at season 5(Cas to Anna, Crowley to Ruby and Meg).

And that would leave us with 1 good female character, 3 evil female characters. Of all those four, only one of them lived on and it wasn't a love interest. 

That's my problem. Love interests are shown from the first episode to either die from being involved with the Winchesters(John to Mary, Sam to Madison and Jessica and Dean to Anna(although that was more of Castiel's fault))

And if you want a much more egregious example look no further further the finale, Sam's love interest is never shown her face. The mother of his children shown out of the shot because... uhhh
Ummm..."

Natural Born Monsters,"It's so hammy and campy it's incredible imo. I loved when the show was more ""grounded"" but I equally love it for going so hard off the rails while being self aware and REALLY committing to it. 

What other show has done that?"
Natural Born Monsters,">!And the end was a slap on the face - to have plot armor throughout the series to die a stupid death to a usual monster. Yeah, I know the meta story, but the point is, deaths are cheap stake - which is why action genre is considered low, whereas other stakes are harder to develop and pay off. And to use sudden character death in the last episode is terribly cheap!<"
Natural Born Monsters,I liked how they depowered them in the last episode or 2 of  season15 but it felt like that could have come way earlier in the show to get them back to fighting more normal monsters.

Natural Born Monsters,"That's ridiculous, lol. Can you imagine a world where seasons 6-15 didn't exist? With SPN having ended 13 years ago and just been one of those shows that faded into maybe cult classic like status? Going out on the highest rated episode of the series would have been great and people probably would have been discussing a potential continuation for the past 13 years. That's when you get them back together and you pick up with a limited new story and the whole point is to finally get Sam out of hell. Instead, they brought him back before the episode ended."
Natural Born Monsters,"And you didn’t quit there and then? I don’t think I would have been so strong, that episode is ROUGH."

They're not in jail. They're not imprisoned. They're not part of some nefarious machine that will reduce them to flesh-colored paste making boring pap. **they directed a couple episodes of a TV show months before you ever found out they did it**, and in that intervening time, they were given awards for being the best directors and making the best picture.

It'll be okay, adults not at all over-bothered much over Kids Movies (and TV Shows) for Grownups. They'll still get to do exactly what they want to do with the blank check they've been issued.

I think Ackles even mentioned that in one of his interviews on Michael Rosenbaum's podcast.

So it wasn't a shocker to me to find out Weatherly was also a huge douche to Eliza Dushku."
Obsession: Dark Desires,I am literally in progress on this show right now lol. I am on Jensen Ackles' first episode! I heard about it many years ago when I started Supernatural and it was always on my list to check out and I finally started it :P.

Obsession: Dark Desires,"It had a lot of potential for worldbuilding and I liked it overall; 

I wouldn't mind a remake set in 30-40 yrs. 

Points of improvement though:

1. go beyond Seattle into other cities/states over seasons
2. make it about more than one nuke that set of an EMP- that won't be enough to set back the US the way the show makes it out to be
3. if they're gonna have 20-episode seasons (and I hope they do), then make some larger arcs through the seasons that scale up the stakes at a slower pace
   1. first season should be about finding some fellow x5's and battling crime/corruption at a base level across Seattle + western US
   2. second season should introduce the government trying to recapture Max and the x5's; perhaps succeeding at the end; small crime + corruption stories inbetween
   3. third season is 50% about her escape and flight through the US to throw off the scent, and 50% about settling back into life as usual; peaking with that wierd cult discovering the x5s
   4. fourth season should be taking on the wierd cult in private; more focus on x5's and other civilian-run genetically enhanced operating underground across the US
   5. 5th season should be about going public; there should be an underground movement to get the VERY genetically enhanced somewhere safe.  Maybe end here the original show did?
   6. 6th onwards could be questionable but I'd like to see the final stakes being genetically enhanced from other countries -like China playing a huge role in some kind of international incident- end with a joint US against some external baddy."

I do think the quality really dropped in the second season, and that’s also when they injured the wrestler Lita on the set and derailed her career at its peak, so teenage me was very angry at the time lol."
Obsession: Dark Desires,"I remember some speculation that at least part of the reason for the show's decline in ratings may have been because of September 11th. In the aftermath of 9/11, the concept of ""America is attacked by a nuke and reduced to a third world country"" didn't sound as entertaining to people."
Obsession: Dark Desires,Loved this show. It was dark and edgy.
Obsession: Dark Desires,"One of the worst victims of Fox's deliberate sabotage, and meddling with a good concept."
Obsession: Dark Desires,I just remember some press event announcing it and thinking Jessica Alba is hot AF
Obsession: Dark Desires,Who does but all I remember is Alba.
Obsession: Dark Desires,They set up season 3 so well too..
Obsession: Dark Desires,"Oh yes, the start of my boyhood crush on Jessica Alba. It was also fairly good TV, at the time. My brother and I followed it for a bit. Guess I'd forgotten it was a James Cameron project."
Obsession: Dark Desires,At one point my favorite tv show.  Haven't watched it since it aired. Think I need to find some dvds.
Obsession: Dark Desires,Great pilot. The rest of the episodes were disappointing for me. Never finished it.
Obsession: Dark Desires,I loved Dark Angel. I had a crush on Jessica Alba and Jensen Ackles. I read book series after season2.
Obsession: Dark Desires,"Yup, loved that show.."
Obsession: Dark Desires,I got both seasons on dvd. There were 3 (I think) books written that take place after the 2nd season that were okay. I had them but they got wet when my basement flooded. Loved the show.
Obsession: Dark Desires,"I think all of us old enough to remember, remember this show fondly. Yet it hasn’t made to streaming  & what copies on dvd or Blu Ray you can buy on Amazon or EBay are extremely overpriced!"
Obsession: Dark Desires,i didn’t find this one until a few years after it was over but it wasn’t bad
Obsession: Dark Desires,"There were also 3 novels after it was canceled, one prequel, and 2 sequels."
Obsession: Dark Desires,"It was a great show!

I think it had the biggest drop in quality between season one and season two that I've ever seen.

The world building was great, interesting story, well-cast, and with James Cameron directing and Jessica Alba as the lead it was almost sure to be a hit.

I think what happened (pure conjecture I know nothing about the financials) was that the show was too expensive to make for the good but not stellar ratings it got. So, they had to cut the budget way, way back."
Obsession: Dark Desires,"That was my Friday night TV jam.  Season 2, Idk what they did other than introduce the mutants, but somehow I lost track."
Obsession: Dark Desires,I have the DVDs and SO and I watch it fairly regularly.
Obsession: Dark Desires,">A few decades ago

Ok take it easy buddy. It was \~22 years ago."
Obsession: Dark Desires,It's funny how their dystopian near-future Seattle is still somehow safer and less decayed than current-day Seattle.
Obsession: Dark Desires,"Great first season, second season completely lost its way. They even had an ""it was all a dream"" episode. They just didn't know what to do with the premise and it showed."
Obsession: Dark Desires,"Man, reading the synopsis of both seasons on Wikipedia was a wild ride. Season one sounds like a fairly normal futuristic action show. And then you get to season two and it descends into some kind of drug fueled psychosis with millennia old breeding cults and dog human hybrids."
Obsession: Dark Desires,I have the set on DVD. Very underrated.
Obsession: Dark Desires,Ah yes the show where weatherly used it as a opportunity to groom alba when she was 18 and he was 30.
Obsession: Dark Desires,"I never understood the Reagan worshipping boss, literally named Normal.  Bip bip bip!"
Obsession: Dark Desires,We were vacationing and met Richard Gunn who played Sketchy on a liquor cruise on a catamaran. He was there with his mum.
Obsession: Dark Desires,Michael Weatherly and Jessica alba. My younger me remembers .
Obsession: Dark Desires,I watched the first season. It was funny how hyped up this show was and then it was suddenly gone again.
Obsession: Dark Desires,"I’ve always presumed this show was Cameron’s way of putting some of his ideas for Battle Angel and Avatar on screen years before he could make those projects with the budgets he wanted. The Battle Angel influence is pretty obvious, but Weatherly’s character ends up a paraplegic who who later regains the ability to walk through assimilating with his love interest’s “kind” in a way that has echoes of Avatar, not to mention some of the season two gene wackiness has undertones for the way the avatars work in the films. There might be other parallels I can’t remember - haven’t watched it in years and years, but it’s interesting from that angle if you’re studying Cameron’s filmography."
Obsession: Dark Desires,"Awesome plot and acting, second year got weird though"
Obsession: Dark Desires,"i loved this show, watched it twice. considering the time it was made, it was pretty good. so much potential, i think a remake could do really well nowadays at the right channel/platform. Amazon could be a good fit, maybe Hulu.

however the best thing about the show to me was Jensen Ackles, and he couldn't be Alec in the remake now so that sucks. 

always found it so odd that a James Cameron show would be cancelled after only 2 seasons. whoever decided to move the show to friday nights fucked up. it deserved a proper ending."
Obsession: Dark Desires,"Yeah, I remember the pilot episode not being very flashy for all thr hype they made it about it being made by Cameron and it being expensive. I don't think there was much in the way of big action scenes.

Their profession of being Gen-X looking couriers, I thought it was kinda silly and forced.  Now that I think about it, they attempted that same premise with Mirrors Edge from DICE and EA.

Ended up being annoyed by the show when the news hit that Michael Weatherly ended up hooking up and somehow duping an absolute-peak Jessica Alba into an engagement. So everything the opening credits roll, I see his smug face. Even back then, I knew there was something annoying about that guy. Those gut feelings were verified when I heard he was being investigated for acting like a sexist douche on his Bull television series.

Lastly, I didn't know he would save his career with Supernatural, but Jensen Ackles will always be the guy who had the shitty plastic LED eye in Season 2. That's when I knew that the show had become pure crap, when it had been a full 10 years after Terminator 2, and they weren't bothering with makeup  and just taping a crappy piece of plastic with a red LED onto this guy's eye."
Obsession: Dark Desires,First season was good. Shocked we haven’t seen a remake
Obsession: Dark Desires,"I remember it, but the only time I ever really paid any attention to it was all the hubbub around one of the show's stunt people dropping WWE's Lita during her guest spot and breaking her neck."
Obsession: Dark Desires,"I remember after i think the first or second season they fired all the actors over the age of 30 except the antagonist guy, possibly to try to appeal to youth. It didn't work and the show died"
Obsession: Dark Desires,I remember it was randomly on the SciFi channel and I watched the first episode and thought it was alright mainly for Jessica. I never watched an episode after that.
Obsession: Dark Desires,Didn't alba and ackles have mad beef on that show?
Obsession: Dark Desires,"There were only two seasons? It felt longer, they covered alot it felt like a season of her running around, a season of the other escapes, a season of the more animal hybrid and a season of that weird Manticore shit. But yeah I guess only two"
Obsession: Dark Desires,"I'm a little late to this but I'm so happy to find other people who remember this show. I absolutely loved it. It was one of my first times feeling so mad about a show being canceled. I even got the follow up books, I still have them somewhere. I torrented the show years ago and still watch it every year or so then read the books. I was a young teen when it came out but have always loved sci-fi and just thought the whole concept of the show was super interesting. I've always thought this would make a good show for some sort of reboot on a streaming platform or something."
Obsession: Dark Desires,"In the first episode,  when she climbs out of the pool wearing a red dress - a defining moment for adolescent me."
Obsession: Dark Desires,"I mean, she was."
Obsession: Dark Desires,Jessica Alba and Sarah Michelle Gellar were my favorites growing up haha
Obsession: Dark Desires,I watched every episode.  The Alba made my pants fit funny.
Obsession: Dark Desires,She was
Obsession: Dark Desires,"Aaaaand, now JA is worth over $100M

(started an organic baby food company)

https://www.celebritynetworth.com/richest-celebrities/actors/jessica-alba-net-worth/"
Obsession: Dark Desires,I think this might be the only reason I watched the show in its entirety
Obsession: Dark Desires,case could certainly be made
Obsession: Dark Desires,I think she jump started my puberty tbh
Obsession: Dark Desires,Watch Idle Hands and thank me for it later. Seems like she spends half the film in a little nightie
Obsession: Dark Desires,Same experience. I first saw her in the Flipper TV show.
Obsession: Dark Desires,"Alba during those years WAS one of the hottest women ever to exist.
14 year old you knew what was up."
Obsession: Dark Desires,Dad?
Obsession: Dark Desires,"she kinda still is :S

and that episode were she is in heat doesnt help"
Obsession: Dark Desires,Then she was asked to act and oh boy was that an awful move.
Obsession: Dark Desires,It's their farm up north.
Obsession: Dark Desires,"Brisco was such a fun show, shame it didn't last longer. Just wasnt destined to be the Next Big Thing."
Obsession: Dark Desires,"X-files was hugely successful on Fridays, so it made some sense that other shows geared at nerds with no life would do well on Friday night. The issue is after 2 or 3 failures they kept doing it instead of realizing the x-files was a one-off thing"
Obsession: Dark Desires,The Lone Gunmen was sent there to die right from the start.
Obsession: Dark Desires,One of those shows they have a good idea for a first season then not sure what to do next.
Obsession: Dark Desires,He must've done some bad shit with Dusku in order for her to get 9 mil
Obsession: Dark Desires,A quick search hasn't been able to show me where it's streaming. The available DVDs seem to be very old and very costly. How are you watching it?
Obsession: Dark Desires,This is still the role I think of whenever I see Kevin Durand's name.
Obsession: Dark Desires,You’ve thought a lot about this.
Obsession: Dark Desires,"I for some reason loved the series and game. And I was a CHILD. At most, 10 years old."
Obsession: Dark Desires,Oh damn. Never knew that’s what happened to Lita
Obsession: Dark Desires,"Dark light wise sure, edgy.... no

She would say stuff like, ""blowin up my pager, better be major"""
Obsession: Dark Desires,Wrong actor
Obsession: Dark Desires,"That wasn’t Jensen, wrong actor."
Obsession: Dark Desires,A moment I played on repeat. Scha-wingggg!
Obsession: Dark Desires,Idle hands..
Obsession: Dark Desires,Still wouldn’t kick her out of bed for farting.
Obsession: Dark Desires,"Nah man, Vampire Willow."
Obsession: Dark Desires,Cordelia was 🔥 .She become even more beautiful as she got older.
Obsession: Dark Desires,Also Ms Parker from the Pretender
Obsession: Dark Desires,Yup. I have two little ones and bought several boxes of Honest diapers and wipes before learning of the connection with Alba. Got a weird boner as a result
Obsession: Dark Desires,[deleted]
Obsession: Dark Desires,The probably figured that being on the same night as the X-Files probably wouldn't hurt.
Obsession: Dark Desires,"Or like other fox shows, the creatives get replaced and suddenly the show is completely different. 

Happened to *Lie to Me*, twice!"
Obsession: Dark Desires,"He was stupid enough to sexually harass her while wearing a mic.  But he still kept his job, which means he actually still won and suffered no consequences - the network paid her.  Will never watch anything he is in now."
Obsession: Dark Desires,"lol- yes.

I tend to think a lot about how to improve the shows i watch! :P Plus post apocalyptic shows are awesome."
Obsession: Dark Desires,"The things our parents let us watch right! That’s like me with Buffy, I was 9 when I started watching that, and I was like 12/13 when Dark Angel first premiered. Did you ever watch Alias? That one also had a video game!"
Obsession: Dark Desires,"Yeah, so they had her doing her signature moves during a fight scene, moonsault and the ‘litacanrana,’ and the stunt double dropped her during the move and she landed on her head. I remember she talked about the experience and said everyone kind of ignored her after it happened, like just went on with their day like it was a little tumble she took or something. Absolutely unreal."
Obsession: Dark Desires,I would encourage her to fart more
Obsession: Dark Desires,Can't leave Faith out of this discussion.
Obsession: Dark Desires,Love me some Willow too haha
Obsession: Dark Desires,Her face when she drops the “bored now”
Obsession: Dark Desires,The evolution of the character from Buffy's first episode to Season 5 Angel was remarkable and I don't think I'm being hyperbolic in saying it's one of the best ever on TV.
Obsession: Dark Desires,Teenage me just praying she'd come find me for it🤣
Obsession: Dark Desires,I heard the second season had different writers. James Cameron apparently said that he preferred season 1.
Obsession: Dark Desires,"damn that's dumb of him


yeah I used to hatewatch Bull, but once the Dushku stuff came out I didn't want to even waste disk space or time pirating it


I stopped it at some batshit part where they >!killed off uhhh, what was her name, I want to say Cable?!< where I was already like ""waht the fuck is with this show"""
Obsession: Dark Desires,"It sounds familiar, I think it was something my parents watched that I would just be in the room for. That's so funny it also had a game 😂 they used to just make games out of anything I guess"
The Prince Who Turns into a Frog,If you’re reading this: episode 1 is worth every damn minute of your time (44ish if I’m correct).
The Prince Who Turns into a Frog,Well of course he is a comic visionary. The guy graduated from one of Canada’s top business schools with really good grades.
The Prince Who Turns into a Frog,"There were at least 4 times in this episode that my wife and I yelled some variation of “he did what?!” During this episode. 

Totally bizarre, captivating, and amazing."
The Prince Who Turns into a Frog,It actually had me in suspense
The Prince Who Turns into a Frog,Isn't the whole point that the show takes literally zero chances
The Prince Who Turns into a Frog,"Loved it, it was captivating. The ending had me screaming at my TV.

Some of his best work yet.

(it's on Binge here in Australia)"
The Prince Who Turns into a Frog,All shall Bow down to Nathan
The Prince Who Turns into a Frog,I just watched “The Rehearsal” last night and loved it! It’s fascinating and has a weird/funny tone.
The Prince Who Turns into a Frog,This was literally the best thing I've seen since Bo Burnham's Inside. Nathan is truly a master at his craft
The Prince Who Turns into a Frog,Nathan Is Truly Something Special.
The Prince Who Turns into a Frog,That’s the guy from Cool Teens
The Prince Who Turns into a Frog,The hype for this is wholly deserved.  One of the most incredible things I’ve seen in many years
The Prince Who Turns into a Frog,Is there any way to watch this in the UK legitimately?
The Prince Who Turns into a Frog,He’s one of my role models truly
The Prince Who Turns into a Frog,Anyone who enjoys this *needs* to watch How To with John Wilson. A very different show that somehow scratches the same itch. I think Nathan produced it too.
The Prince Who Turns into a Frog,"1st ep was genius, borderline sociopathic, but genius nonetheless"
The Prince Who Turns into a Frog,dissecting human nature
The Prince Who Turns into a Frog,"It may not just be for me, but isn’t is comedy at the expense of others?  Or am I misunderstanding?"
The Prince Who Turns into a Frog,Is this a reality show? I just cannot tell from the description.
The Prince Who Turns into a Frog,Couldn’t even make it thru the first episode.
The Prince Who Turns into a Frog,It’s like “door city” over here.
The Prince Who Turns into a Frog,What streaming service is it on? I keep seeing posts about the show but not where I can watch it
The Prince Who Turns into a Frog,It’s days like these that I curse the chinese for inventing gunpowder
The Prince Who Turns into a Frog,Just finished it. Laughed out loud many times but the camera cut in the alley at the end to the actor had me keeled over
The Prince Who Turns into a Frog,"Just watched it based on your comment! It was a good first episode, great concept! Just a bit more wholesome than comedic than I expected from reading the title."
The Prince Who Turns into a Frog,?
The Prince Who Turns into a Frog,"Lemme guess: 

-Starting fake blog 

-Hiring dude's friend to write for blog 

-Using fake blog to interview trivia host and steal questions for trivia contest

-Building complete replica set of bar 

-Everything else"
The Prince Who Turns into a Frog,"Well played. Although, I’d say the show itself takes chances, but the people in the experiment in the show do not."
The Prince Who Turns into a Frog,"Show some respect, its the guy who made the Teenyverse."
The Prince Who Turns into a Frog,"Sadly, there isn’t. You can check this website: https://www.justwatch.com/uk/tv-series/the-rehearsal"
The Prince Who Turns into a Frog,Not yet but it is a regular HBO show so it will turn up on Sky at some point. They usually air the smaller shows like this once they wrap their runs.
The Prince Who Turns into a Frog,"His last show, Nathan For You, definitely had moments that were trying to be funny at the expense of others--although it was more common for Nathan to use himself as the butt of a joke. 

In this show (or at least in the first episode that aired last night) the comedy is mostly about the extreme lengths he goes to in order to help someone, and I really can't remember a single moment that felt mean-spirited to me."
The Prince Who Turns into a Frog,He never makes anyone do or say anything. They know they're doing a TV show.  The beauty of the show is that he's getting genuine reactions from people.
The Prince Who Turns into a Frog,"From the description, it sounds awkward as hell. 

> the goal of the show is to help real people prepare for difficult conversations or big life changes by putting them through a practice session with actors posing as loved ones, friends, and bystanders. But as the first season wears on, Fielder, playing a needy and insecure version of himself, becomes as much a part of the rehearsals as the folks he is supposedly assisting, and uses these interactions to reflect on his existential woes

So it's real people, and they're having to deal with someone playing a huge narcissist and making their problems about himself. Yikes."
The Prince Who Turns into a Frog,Its a comedian interacting with real people. So kinda like Borat but a completely different vibe
The Prince Who Turns into a Frog,Yes. Nathan has a script for some parts but the rest is real.
The Prince Who Turns into a Frog,"It’s close to a comedic version of Straight Guy. Real people and real situations, but kind of over the top in a comedic, but not mean spirited way."
The Prince Who Turns into a Frog,You have to watch it. I technically couldn't tell you it's unscripted but it's as blurry a line as it could possibly ever be
The Prince Who Turns into a Frog,It’s like Nathan For You with HBO’s budget and fewer side quests.
The Prince Who Turns into a Frog,"And that's totally ok. I love it, but I also get that it's just not some people's sense of humor."
The Prince Who Turns into a Frog,HBO max
The Prince Who Turns into a Frog,"I lost it when he came out in disguise with baggy pants a too large jacket , a bucket hat and a shell necklace."
The Prince Who Turns into a Frog,"Reference 
https://youtu.be/_w5D4QJbLW8"
The Prince Who Turns into a Frog,"Most of those, plus the answers given on a walk, and how Nate’s confession at the end about the trivia answers was to the actor he was working with, not the actual person. And it took me a full 10-15 seconds to realize it wasn’t the same guy."
The Prince Who Turns into a Frog,Ty
The Prince Who Turns into a Frog,"I wouldn't hold your breath, How To With John Wilson still hasn't ever been released in the UK nearly two years after its US release"
The Prince Who Turns into a Frog,Agreed. I actually felt like he showed how sympathetic the real people were. I was rooting for them the whole time
The Prince Who Turns into a Frog,That is great to hear.
The Prince Who Turns into a Frog,I appreciate that.  And l know they sign up for it.  I guess it’s just not for me.  I want to see people shine.
The Prince Who Turns into a Frog,Thank you for this.  I don’t know why our comments got downvoted.
The Prince Who Turns into a Frog,Nathan for You also had HBO's budget.
The Prince Who Turns into a Frog,thanks idk why i got downvoted lol
The Prince Who Turns into a Frog,Holy crap! I didn’t notice that.
The Prince Who Turns into a Frog,That show is brilliant.
The Prince Who Turns into a Frog,I wonder if all episodes will be like this. The big lesson will be that we worry about the worst reaction from people for no reason
The Prince Who Turns into a Frog,"Wow my comment hasn't aged well, The Rehearsal comes out in the UK tomorrow"
The Prince Who Turns into a Frog,That’s hardly news worthy. I’m already a devout fan.
The Prince Who Turns into a Frog,What a stupid title. If you watch three season of something of course you're a fan.
The Prince Who Turns into a Frog,"I love this show.

Wish it were talked about more but glad Netflix keeps it going."
The Prince Who Turns into a Frog,"Does the frame rate and animation style get better? I’m sure the show is good, but I could barely get through the first episode because of the slow frame rate"
The Prince Who Turns into a Frog,Been a devout fan since the first episode.
The Prince Who Turns into a Frog,"Was always put off by the hyper generic name and made for a younger audience vibe (which I had no trouble putting aside for either Avatar). Might give it a shot, been real hard to get into anything lately."
The Prince Who Turns into a Frog,"If the first season or the second didn't do that, sure as hell will not happen on the third."
The Prince Who Turns into a Frog,Never heard of the series will go check it out
The Prince Who Turns into a Frog,"Jokes on them, I already am a fan boy"
The Prince Who Turns into a Frog,[deleted]
The Prince Who Turns into a Frog,"I love this show and at the same time I am so fearful for its future. When you think of 'Netflix Animated Show' you always think of Disenchantment, Bojack or F is For Family but never this which is a shame because it is just as good/better than those shows.

I truly hope we get all 7 seasons"
The Prince Who Turns into a Frog,I’m with you there. One of my favourite shows airing right now
The Prince Who Turns into a Frog,Yeah it's a great show.
The Prince Who Turns into a Frog,shhhh there are those who still need to be converted
The Prince Who Turns into a Frog,"I wish these ""Season 8 is the best television ever released"" threads would stop appearing for every single streaming show out there.  There has to be a better way to market these shows besides exaggerated news articles that all read the same.

Two others from just today:

[Episode 2 of The Mandalorian is amazing and one of the best Star Wars content ever.] (https://www.reddit.com/r/television/comments/dwshij/episode_2_of_the_mandalorian_is_amazing_and_one/)

[The Man in the High Castles Final Season is also its Best] (https://www.reddit.com/r/television/comments/dwsb3j/the_man_in_the_high_castles_final_season_is_also/)"
The Prince Who Turns into a Frog,They improved the style in the second season.
The Prince Who Turns into a Frog,They did fix the frame rate after season 1 in response to the criticism. But even after watching the first couple eps I wasn’t distracted by the frame rate again. I think you just get used to the style
The Prince Who Turns into a Frog,"You actually kinda get used to it. It was an effect they were going for and found that people did not like it so they made it smoother for second season. 

It honestly it's a very fantastic show with a great story and some beautiful artwork. Give it a shot if you like animation!"
The Prince Who Turns into a Frog,"same. its not so much how low the rate is, but how everything was a different frame rate"
The Prince Who Turns into a Frog,"The frame rate isn’t necessarily improved in a lot of places, but it’s handled better so it doesn’t feel choppy when it drops."
The Prince Who Turns into a Frog,"It's like Avatar without the growing pains. Really solid, and if you can stomach the animation you get over it after a few episodes"
The Prince Who Turns into a Frog,"What were they thinking with that? How did no one look at that and say ""yeah, this is going to be a big problem for a lot of people."" If it were for artistic effect, sure, but it just seems like bad animation."
The Prince Who Turns into a Frog,This article made me think S3 was out :(
The Prince Who Turns into a Frog,"Ok but for real tho, season 4 of Dexter is one of the best seasons of television."
The Prince Who Turns into a Frog,There is a pretty big difference between trying to get someone to watch a show because the final season is good and trying to get someone to watch a show because the second episode is good.
The Prince Who Turns into a Frog,Game of thrones season 8 was the best televisi— HAHAHHAA
The Prince Who Turns into a Frog,But TMitHC is great television; since season 1.
The Prince Who Turns into a Frog,Nothing tops how *Heroes* wrapped things up so well.
The Prince Who Turns into a Frog,That finale was amazing I couldn't wait to see what was coming next. It's such a shame Heroes was canceled after one season.
The Prince Who Turns into a Frog,"I thought the first episode was ridiculously great. The second episode had some dropoff, but that's to be expected, especially given how great the first one was.

I read the book when it was published, and recently read the sequel (*Agency*). I don't think it's possible to capture Gibson's penchant for detail in a TV show. I do think that — so far — this series captures the essence of the story and tells it very, very well given the different rules of the different medium.

Watch the show, it rocks."
The Prince Who Turns into a Frog,It's okay so far. Me and my partner will watch it til the end. We are unfamiliar with the books.
The Prince Who Turns into a Frog,I like it.
The Prince Who Turns into a Frog,"Loved the first two episodes.

Best start to a series in a long time IMO."
The Prince Who Turns into a Frog,"God.  The incessant fucking criticism of any new TV show or movie, especially one based on a book or other media, is absolutely fucking exhausting.  Not everything has to be a revolutionary timeless iconic masterpiece.  Can’t something just be “good” or “entertaining” or “interesting” and enjoyed accordingly?

For fuck’s sake.  I wanna act like this is a new phenomenon, but then I remember Jay and Silent Bob Strikes Back is over 20 years old.  Maybe there’s just way more of it now because every asshole with an opinion is on the Internet now.  Myself included."
The Prince Who Turns into a Frog,First three episodes are pretty good. High quality make
The Prince Who Turns into a Frog,I just watched the first two episodes and I really enjoyed them. I finished the book about six weeks ago so everything was still fresh in my mind. I am really digging the futuristic London scenes.
The Prince Who Turns into a Frog,"Eh, I disagree.

I think the acting is a little uneven at times, but overall the writing/pacing has been pretty solid, the world building is great, with the right amount of cryptic.

Probably one of the best sci-fi shows currently airing, along with Severance."
The Prince Who Turns into a Frog,I don’t remember the last time I saw a positive review of a show.
The Prince Who Turns into a Frog,Critics have really gone to shit
The Prince Who Turns into a Frog,What's wrong with generic Sci fi !!!
The Prince Who Turns into a Frog,"I'm about to unsub from here, STOP WITH ALL THE FUCKING NEGATIVE ARTICLES!

Sucks because I find tv shows I've never even heard of and the list on the side is awesome, but these OP's constantly shoving negative articles are making me about to hit that button."
The Prince Who Turns into a Frog,[deleted]
The Prince Who Turns into a Frog,"I watched the first episode. It seemed OK and there's some potential there but I didn't see much there to prioritize it over other things I could be watching. I think I'll eventually watch it all later on, if not just for Chloe Grace Moretz."
The Prince Who Turns into a Frog,"that sucks, I'll probably still watch it though and see how generic it is."

Miss Rose,"I dunno, I think bringing Vera back was just to be able to make that episode. I agree it was almost awkward to do so, but so worth it. Anyway, loose ends tend to rear their heads irl, so I'm cool with it.

I feel it's quite certain that ""real"" Eliot is far from normal. We never see that one though, just his sort of his own fantasy about what that might be like (which totally crumbles anyway). We never meet him, in fact we're left hanging, but it makes a great ending.

I agree about tyrell's end. I'm ok with him simply being irresistibly drawn to Eliot. That happens. And yeah, Joanna dies and that's the end of that. I'm not sure what's left missing there. I kind of liked that. After a lifetime of seriously messing with people, one eventually caught up with her. She was a great character, but I'm good with this ending. People die and the world keeps spinning.

White Rose, well I get what you mean but the background and the larger after arc makes the ride worth it. We are probably all living in a reality shaped by a delusional power player, so it's interesting that this may be what that can be about. It would be a little more satisfying if her ultimate motivation were a bit less emotional and petty but I just let this go to enjoy the rest.

Angela, well she figured out how to stand up and got mowed down for it. Check. At least she got there. One of my favorite characters, but yep the world is cruel and unfair. There was triumph in her arc but you only get so much.

I watched it through a bunch of times in a row right after my first viewing just last year. The one thing that eats at me and detracts from my enjoyment is that Darlene never gets called out. I mean, I give her a big pass because Eliot needs her and she's had a rough time herself. But so much of the worst stuff is her doing (sloppiness, neediness, or selfishness) and none of it ever catches up to her and it seems like no one even notices. This bothers me to no end. In particular, Cisco's demise and that *she knew all along but that served her needs so too bad*. Those are just the biggest examples, it's pretty nonstop. This doesn't seem to bother most people, so I guess it's just me. To be fair, tons of people live like this, so there's that.

The only other thing that really bothers me is the line about 'I'm a mercenary,' when what he's describing is the opposite of a mercenary. It's just one cringe but repeated for a second time and I wish it weren't.

But I love this show and love the end as much as everything in between. For me it's truly a masterpiece hard to beat."
Miss Rose,"I wish it ended an episode earlier or left things a bit more ambiguous. I loved the tower hack but didn’t really like the alternate reality fake out. I suppose I wasn’t expecting White Rose’s machine really to amount to anything but it does beg the question what all this wealth and resources were being spent on. I guess a charitable reading would be it’s a Theranos situation. However, just kind of tired of sci fi ideas being introduced in tv/movies only be to hand waved away later with “it doesn’t matter, it’s all about the characters!” (Hello Lost.)

I think the one saving grace of the final episode is that the final moments with Darlene and Elliott were moving"
Miss Rose,"The show was great.

Ending didn't do it for me either.

I think you should have phrased it: ""What did people like about the Mr. Robot ending?"""
Miss Rose,"THANK YOU! 

I loved this show, and it felt like everything was being set up for an amazing reveal and it was all building to something great. The ending left so many questions unanswered and so many dangling threads and so many hand-wave explanations. It really felt like we got robbed of the true ending.

I get downvoted to oblivion for mentioning it, but I really think the ending MUST be a false one to make any sense.

I'm not sure the details, but my gut tells me that Elliot has far more alters than is ever explicitly told. I find it interesting that he was able to create a false world within his mind, and wonder if he's done that in layers for the setting of the show. Like why was every car white in that one episode? 

I haven't got my full fledged theory of the show yet, but there has to be a lot more than we're given. I sincerely doubt the ""reality"" of the show's universe at literally any point (even the end)."
Miss Rose,"I wasn't a big fan of Mr. Robot's ending (*and the final season in general, though I loved some of the episodes as there own individual thing*). But it was highly praise so... idk... maybe I was just missing something??

I feel like that grand mystery or apocalypse that they were building up to in seasons 2 & 3 were just absent or glossed over. Idk... I should rewatch the entire series as a whole someday."
Miss Rose,"Mr Robot in general is very disappointed to me after season 1.

I really didn't understand the point of the white rose character at all. It was all building up to something big, something so over the top that it could be supernatural but in the end it was nothing.

The conclusion to Eliot's character is just so meh. The kind of basic twist you would see in some anthology series.

I could not understand the cult following the series had by the third and fourth season. Felt like it wasn't even that popular in season 1 when it was actually good.

I still think the first episode of the first season is THE BEST opening episode of any TV show I've ever watched. I re-watched it so many times during season 1."
Miss Rose,Eyyyye mate the trauma of existence.
Miss Rose,"Wait okay, there are a lot of people here agreeing with me. I guess I wasn't clear. I'm open to being convinced! Please tell me why it's generally considered really good! I'm open to understanding!"
Miss Rose,"Not sure. Most people I talked to thought the ending made the entire show a waste of time. 

That show in general always felt like they were writing on the fly and they tried to pack too much into each episode."
Miss Rose,I’m getting really tired of the recent flood of posts of people just saying I don’t like this show.  It’s not really adding to any discussion
Miss Rose,Beats me. I was all in on season 1 but when they didn't bother to put a single interesting moment in session 2 episode 1 I stopped watching.
Miss Rose,"They really shit the bed with the ending.  Reminds me of Quantum Leap, The Sopranos, and Game of Thrones."
Miss Rose,I kept thinking I was watching the last 2 episodes of neon Genesis evangalion
Miss Rose,Sam sepiol is an Easter egg. It the the first name of Sam Esmail and last name of Alex sepiol (USA network executive vice president) combined.
Miss Rose,"1. Vera's return wasn't just a wrench thrown into their plans. Vera cruelly forced Elliot into uncovering his repressed traumas. It is this revelation on top of all the aweful tragedy and evil that Elliot has witnessed that he has to battle against when White Rose offers him a chance for reseting everything and to gamble on the potential for a new world. Even with this knowledge, Elliot still chooses to side with those who love him and ""save the world.""
More broadly, the show is, in part, about how people lock away their vulnerabilities because they fear extending that trust will lead to betrayal and ""exploitation."" Hence the cyber security motif. If Vera's origin story is to be believed, its about how abuse perpetuates abuse. That's why it was Krista who offs Vera. She intervenes because she is a good person who cares about Elliot and recognizes what's happening. (Elliot even says as much when he digs into her personal life and sees she's a genuinely loving person.) Elliot doesn't defeat his trauma in the end. But he does recognize that the world is worth saving for the people out there who do love him for who he is and help him through his struggles. 

2. Tyrrell's story is frequently the most polarizing of the show. Fans have different interpretations. I believe that everything Tyrrell does is for himself. He wants to have meaning, he wants purpose, and he wants a sense that everything he's sacrificed was worth it in the end. If it were Tyrrell, not Elliot, facing off against White Rose, he would kick off White Roses invention. 
The thing about Tyrrell is he views relationships as purely transactional. He doesn't love Elliot because its the right thing to do. (Krista, Darlene, and Elliot himself) He does it because he sees him as a tool to fulfill his destiny. 
Its only when Tyrrell sacrifices himself and walks away, doing something selfless and throwing away his mission to imbue his life with meaning does he find happiness in the woods. 

3.  Elliot and Darlene might not be perfectly well-adusted after the show is over. However, Elliot's tear is the culmination of his lived experiences up to this point with the knowledge that selfless, loving people are looking out for him. Darlene sees this. ""Hello Elliot"" is essentially ""welcome to the beginning of the rest of your life."" Their sibling relationship is what is the beating heart of the show and its stronger at the end then it ever was before. He's a ""normie"" because he's just like everyone trying to live despite all the loneliness, insecurity, and abuse people endure. 

4. Because she emotionally manipulated people into believing she could wish away all their trauma and abuse, rewrite their vulnerabilities away, and offer them something better in exchange for allegiance. Angela fell victim to this. 

I hope these explanations help. You should check out the subreddit if you want some more analysis and competing perspectives for how to interpret the ending of the show."
Miss Rose,"Thanks for making this thread, my friend and I watched and were disappointed by the ending - having enjoyed most of the show - but I remember all the people on the show subreddit gushing about it"
Miss Rose,"That's hilarious with the Phillip Price quote, I never thought about that. He probably picked it up from some ridiculous business meeting 20 years ago and misremembered it.

Interesting points about Darlene. I think she gets a pass from viewers because she's so likeable in the Elliot version of the world we all get to see (when she's not actively fucking up people's lives)"
Miss Rose,I honestly thought that was the finale and was totally happy with it. Then the next episode started and I was like wtf is this and it hurt the overall experience for sure.
Miss Rose,"Out of curiosity, what did you think was left unanswered? I think, bar one character’s fate, nearly everything was resolved by the end of the show."
Miss Rose,"Yes yes yes wait, can we talk about the ""bugs"" like the white cars? I was always convinced they were on purpose. That episode with the riot outside of e-corp, Elliot is on a top floor. The camera very purposefully pans over to the street and it's empty. ????????? I remember reading on here someone had a theory about it but didn't share, and it's scratched my brain since.

If the false world thing is true, innocent things we had to suspend our disbelief with, like no trash pickup in NYC being reasonably solved with burning things (have you been to NYC on trash day?) start to make more sense"
Miss Rose,"Same! The season 2 ending twist with all those buildings blowing up really shook me. But then it sort of just circles around without really answering anything. Why spend all that time bringing up the Congo if the final nuclear face off just takes place in NJ? Also a good chance to create parallels with the deaths of Angela's mom, but doesn't do that either."
Miss Rose,"It's weird, because apparently Sam Esmail did know the ending going in, it was a totally planned out movie before USA took it and created the series."
Miss Rose,"Oof, Game of Thrones. I mean, the characters stayed compelling in Mr. Robot."
Miss Rose,"Price, I really don't know what to make of it because they do it twice.  Maybe it's a statement on how misguided price is, but that doesn't seem to fit. Hard to believe no one on the show knows what mercenary means, but that's what it feels like to me. So either a great job or a botch job, but I don't like it.

Darlene, well she's a survivor who's learned to get by so there's that. Irl, people operating like this usually get away with it enough of the time. I think fans of her character have oodles of sympathy for her (understandably) and find her charismatic enough to root for her more than analyze her mechanics."
Miss Rose,"Like OP said, Tyrell stuff has a lot of questions. How did he meet Elliot? Why did his wife recognize Elliot? Why did Elliot wake up from one of his episodes in Tyrell's car despite not knowing it would be there or that it was his? What was the deal with Tyrell, Elliot, and Mr Robot walking in circles repeatedly in that one episode? Are we really supposed to believe that it was just a coincidence that the dude whose name i can't remember just wrote a best selling book called Beach towel, left the dark army and then ran into the agent in the airport? It's just a coincidence that Angela's real dad is who he is? Why were the dark army so loyal to white rose based on promises of time travel with no evidence to support? Why even do those later episodes with Vera (which were really fucking great)? Leon just shows back up in the final season because Elliot wants him? How does that work? Leon isn't even his real name!

It's been a while since I've watched the show but there are so many of these nagging little questions and dangling threads that I have to believe it was done intentionally at least to some degree. This show is too well done with a lot of attention to detail that it seems out of place to have such glaring omissions.

I think something didn't add up. 

My best guess, which nobody ever seems to agree with, is that almost all of the characters we interact with in the show are asked alters. There are many visual shots and story details to support this. 

I believe that these alters, along with Mr Robot and the narrator and us all exist within the real Elliot's psyche and what we're watching throughout the series isn't really a story about breaking a financial system, but about Elliot's internal revolution to break free of his DID and rejoin the real world as a whole person."
Miss Rose,"With Joanna and Tyrell, you're totally right that that happens irl. In my opinion, the best shows always connect everything together and have a purpose within the larger story or serves to propel it forward. Maybe that's not the sort of show Mr. Robot was ever trying to be... More nihilistic maybe than what I'm used to watching"
Miss Rose,"Right I’ll try to answer some but it’s been a while since I’ve watched sooo I could be wrong in some of this. 

I’m not sure if you mean something else by how he met Elliott, but they meet for the first time in Ep 1, when Tyrell tours the office. His wife recognised him after meeting him (posing as someone called Olly) in Season 1. Not quite sure on why he woke up in his car, I think that’s accepted as 3 days of normal Elliott POV, which we never see in the show, but I’m not 100% on that. 

I’ll grant you that the woods episode was an odd one lol, as was the meeting with Irving in the airport. The dark army thing is just standard cult shit. For Leon, he briefly says that he’s a freelancer and that Elliott can call him whenever at the start of S4. 

Hopefully most of that is accurate and not shite I’ve conjured up in my head after a year lol"
Miss Rose,"""How did he meet Elliot?""  


They met each other in the first episode. The cubicles have employee's names on them, which is how he knew his name.  


""Why did his wife recognize Elliot?""  


Did she..? He specifically lies to her about his name when searching for Tyrell. Unless you mean when she shows up outside his apartment, which happens an entire season after she first meets him.  


""Why did Elliot wake up in Tyrell's car?""  


They show this in a season 3 episode detailing what happened the night of the 5/9 hack. Irving told Elliot to drive Tyrell's car elsewhere to cover-up where Tyrell's actual location would be while he was transported to a secluded location.  


""What was the deal with walking in circles?""  


That entire episode is supposed to be weird and uncanny - it's a loop in circles to make each character (and the viewer) feel like they're going insane. Tyrell's death makes sense because he died as he lived, imagining that he was far more important than he was when he was nothing but a moronic psychopath full of money.  


""Irving at the airport is suspicious""  


It's one of the few issues I have with the show as it's weird/messy, but it's the most direct way to wrap up the loose end of the Dark Army. Essentially saying that, yes, these two characters are escaped from this now. You're reading too much into something that isn't there. If he wanted to kill her, why wouldn't they have done it already? Especially since at that point the Deus Group has lost their money, Whiterose is dead and the entire army is pretty much scattered. There's nothing left to gain from killing her, and nobody to command the job.  


""Angela's real dad is who he is""  


I don't know why this is an issue to you. He just... is.   


""Why were they so loyal to Whiterose despite lack of evidence""  


That's the point. What did she give them that tricked them all into being so loyal that they would kill themselves? Angela frequently mentions that she's ""seen it"". The point is not the answer to the mystery, it's that Whiterose is so deluded in attempting to fix her own reality that whatever she's conjured up is manipulative enough to take advantage of people just as wounded as her. Elliot suffers from the same level of pain and uses it to help others - Whiterose is the opposite. They're two different paths damage can do to you.  


""Why was Vera there?""  


It's one of the most awkward bits of the show that leads into one of the best episodes. Not really much else to say.  


""Why does Leon show up?""  


He's a mercenary. They mention this in one of the episodes.  


The reason nobody agrees with your theory is it undermines the entire show and its point - and not only that, it makes no sense with all of the characters and their reasonings. The show is more intelligent than ""it's all in Elliot's head"".  


It seems like you read too much into the 'why' of things and weren't paying enough attention. Nearly everything you asked is directly answered. I think it's a show that takes  at least 2 watches to really appreciate and fully grasp."
Miss Rose,"I like things a bit less neat just to be both less predictable (surprise me!) and anti-canny, and more realistic, but admittedly my idea of realistic tends toward nihlilism so you're onto something there haha. I am not a fan of the ""chekhov's gun"" dramatic theory in itself at all, but understand that most people are. But I think Mr Robot overall is pretty tightly woven story-wise, with mostly only motivations (and sometimes what even really happened exactly and can anyone even say anyhow) a lot more open to speculation.

Honestly, that's what made rewatching it so interesting. Depending on what further thoughts and observations you had the last time, each rewatch had a totally different tone. Like the second watch was obviously totally different than the first, it was almost a different show. I think I watched 2 more times after that and I was thinking about and noticing and feeling totally different things on each of those. Figuring out what actually happened starts to drop off (either because it has already become clear, or for other reasons has become less important) and it gets more abstract. 

Like if you were to rewatch it now, you won't be focused on tracking what white Rose is really up to because you already know where that goes, at least superficially, and doubly so because you don't love it. But you might find that you start picking up on other things about her character or its place in the story or world at large, and get a different vibe from it. Or pick up on new things adjacent to that thread that start to color other parts of the story, and you start caring about that more than what's strictly going on. 

I guess the point I'm coming to is you might like conclusion more if you watch it enough times haha. But I do relate to what you didn't like (at this point). I get caught up in other stuff that dilutes any disappointments there. Like Tyrell's end. I was totally in disbelief the first time around. But then the final episode in particular really just pushed that kind of thing aside real quick! And having gotten used to the idea, it makes sense now. Tyrell gave up. He'd lost everything and wanted to serve up the last bit as a gift to Eliot. Eliot is not exactly an angel when it comes to sparing others' feelings (in itself catnip to certain type) and took it. Then got bailed out by darlene. Ok, now that workd even if I don't love it.

But I think all this is why all the love for the final season."
Miss Rose,"So it's mentioned that they knew one another prior to the first episode. Either way, it's strange that he offers him an executive position after knowing him for such a short time. And why did that meeting occur in a place that is repeatedly shown and mentioned to only exist in Elliot's mind?

Some of the other things are loose in my mind because it's been a while, but there are inconsistencies in the versions you point out (which are accurate to the episodes, if memory serves) and other occurrences in the show. It's hard to describe without a full rewatch. Maybe one day.

While we're talking about it though, if Elliot's Dad wasn't a problem and Elliot invented the abusiveness and all, why was Darlene so messed up? Why did she have the whole Lolita thing going on, as well?

I'm just saying, I think there's the explanations they give (which you've pointed out) and things that don't add up about them. I don't think it's lazy writing, so that leads me to believe that there's more to the story than the audience is being explicitly told."
Miss Rose,"There are reasons [GRRM regularly rewatches the show](https://georgerrmartin.com/notablog/2020/09/10/c-c-claudius-aka-i-clavdivs/).  I do, too.  It's also why I kind of huff a little when folks call *Rome* the greatest historical tv show of the period they've ever seen. :D

There isn't much that's on the same level, but Dennis Potter's ***Pennies From Heaven*** and ***The Singing Detective*** (not on streaming, afaik) to me are god-level tv; they can both tear your guts out. Both also got remade as movies. Avoid the *Pennies From Heaven* movie (unless you're a Steve Martin fan or need to see Christopher Walken dancing; but it's Hollywood supremely not-getting the source material); the *Singing Detective* movie remake is better since Potter did most of the screenplay himself before he died, but it's still softer than the original tv series, even with Robert Downey Jr. in the lead. I also liked Potter's later work, like *Lipstick on Your Collar* (*very* young Ewan McGregor), *Blackeyes* (very young Gina Bellman)*,* and *Karaoke/Cold Lazarus* \[where Albert Finney stars, and Ian McDiarmid gets to play someone other than Palpatine :-\]*,* but most think they're weaker series.

Also god-level tv is Alan Bennett's ***Talking Heads*** (also not on streaming, but probably youtube-able), can also slay you with nothing but monologues and insanely great actors (including Bennett himself). I'm pissed off as hell at [PBS for promising us](https://tellyspotting.kera.org/2020/10/19/talking-heads-revamp-celebrates-masterpieces-50th-on-pbs-in-2021/) only two of [the 2020 BBC remakes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ww6Oex3MI90), rather than the full dozen (and not the two that are the new ones!), and then not even delivering those. (If you want a taste of the remakes, [here's some clips](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p08ftkkx/clips)).

A show that shares two stars with *I, Claudius* (Sian Phillips and Patricia Quinn; Livia and Livilla) and that had *Doctor Who* folk behind the camera (Verity Lambert and Waris Husein) is the Pankhurst/suffragette biodrama, ***Shoulder to Shoulder*** (can't find it on streaming)***.*** Phillips plays mother Emmaline Pankhurst, while Quinn plays daughter Christabel; Angela Down plays Sylvia Pankhurst. Possibly the first time a UK tv show had a primarily female cast.

Phillips also was in an adaptation of ***How Green Was My Valley*** **(1975)** \[again not on streaming I can find\] that was kickass, since the entire cast was actually Welsh. Phillips primarily spoke Welsh up until the age of 18 when she went to London to pursue acting. Her Beth is monumental. BTW, other trivia: she was married to Peter O'Toole around the time she was in *I, Claudius,* and to SF fans, she'll forever be known as the Reverend Mother in Lynch's *Dune.* :) She's still around and acting, btw. I last saw her in *C.B. Strike* on HBO Max and she's apparently been cast in Season 2 of *Good Omens*).

And then there's ***Tenko*** (Britbox in the UK, but not in the US)*,* an ITV drama about British women in a Pacific theatre POW camp during WWII that always killed me.

Mid-80s (so not quite the mid-70s of *I, Claudius)* there's ***Brideshead Revisited*** (Freevee, Tubi, etc.)*,* based on the Evelyn Waugh novel. It stars a very young Jeremy Irons and Anthony Andrews, and the background cast includes Laurence freakin' Olivier. (If you can find Olivier's 1983 *King Lear* from around this time period, it's pretty great, too. [The cast is to die for](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0087561/reference/). John Hurt plays the Fool, Diana Rigg is Regan, Leo McKern is Gloucester, Robert Lindsay is Edmund to David Threfall's Edgar, it's a parade of stars).

And I always always was a sucker for *any* John Hawkesworth historical drama (mostly via *Masterpiece Theatre),* so ***Upstairs Downstairs*** (Britbox; the show that *Downton Abbey* wants to be, but kind of misses by a mile), ***The Duchess of Duke Street*** (Amazon Prime)*,* ***The Flame Trees of Thika*** (Acorn)*,* ***Danger UXB*** (AcornTV)*,* and ***Sherlock Holmes*** (Britbox) all come under that heading.  Hawkesworth's *Sherlock Holmes* (where Jeremy Brett plays Holmes and either David Burke or Edward Hardwicke is Watson) are of particularly interest if you like *Sherlock,* since it's incredibly sublimely obvious that both Moffat and Gatiss were rabid fans of that show (and the books) and that the show freed them from ever having to do a ""faithful"" adaptation of the stories and let them go their own way.

One other little dramedy that I *adored* from this time period is ***Flickers*** which [you can find on Freevee](https://www.amazon.com/Part-1/dp/B07CVJVFM4). Possibly the first thing I ever saw Bob Hoskins in. It's written by Roy Clarke, and it's about a Cockney entrepreneur who wants to get a film studio off the ground in the days of silent film. It also stars Frances de la Tour.

BTW, if you want to see what the actor who played Claudius looks like now that he's *actually* in his 80s, Derek Jacobi is one of the stars in Sally Wainwright's dramedy [*Last Tango in Halifax*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IN4gS00ZnT8) (Netflix). Very atypical role for him to play a Northern gaffer :), as he typically gets ""posh"" roles. Like his appearance on *Doctor Who* (s3e11, ""Utopia"") or *The Crown* (s3e8 *""Dangling Man"").*

In the US, after the success of shows like *I, Claudius,* there were also historical drama miniseries aplenty like ***Roots*** (HBO Max) and ***Shogun*** (not on streaming, but starred Richard Chamberlain and Toshiro Mifune, and is about to be remade by FX on Hulu) that might also be worth looking for.

\--edited to fix some typos and editing detritus, some small elaborations."
Miss Rose,Bit of a different tone but you could try the original BBC adaptation of House of Cards.
Miss Rose,"This is one of the best posts I've seen here. I too adored *I, Claudius* as well. For anyone who is interested in an another extremely good older TV series, I'd like to recommend 1979's *Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy*. Imo, it's one of the best espionage stories ever put on film."
Miss Rose,"Honestly, the books (there are two) are significantly better... perhaps me having already read them and loved them diminished how much i liked the series..."
Miss Rose,Leave the figs.
Miss Rose,Derek Jacobi's performance as Claudius is unparalleled.
Miss Rose,One of the best TV shows ever.
Miss Rose,And now you will dream another dream...altogether.
Miss Rose,Never knew they made a show of it.  Great great book!  Thanks for your write up!
Miss Rose,"I’m a man in my mid 40’s and I never try to stop myself crying during movies or tv shows. I used to, I also used to drink a lot to handle the emotions I was suppressing in all aspects of my life. I recommend to men that they express the things they feel."
Miss Rose,I liked the series but casting Brian Blessed as Octavian was such a weird choice.
Miss Rose,The show is a masterpiece but I didn't particularly like the ending tbh. The whole plan of picking Nero because Claudius knew Nero would screw up and Britanicus can swoop in and restore the republic is just so out there.
Miss Rose,"I’ll only e commend stuff the past decade 

Halt and Catch Fire

Euphoria S1

I think you’d like Barry

I can’t recommend the movie Palm Springs enough

Justified is really good, so is Person of Interest (less so), but The Leftovers if you’re into some slow shit

S1 of Fargo, True Detective

Legion, Mr Robot, S1 Russian Doll, Maniac, Hannibal, Mad Men"
Miss Rose,watch k-dramas and you'll cry every week bud
Miss Rose,"The Rosie Fingers of Dawn was my first piece of jaw dropping television.

Truly a magnificent ground breaking series."
Miss Rose,The Flame Trees of Thika
Miss Rose,This is an unexpectedly moving write up op. Fair play.
Miss Rose,He's a Leeds United fan too which is a big plus. Great guy.
Miss Rose,"> Uncle Claudius, I wasn't the Messiah after all, would you believe that? Could have knocked me over with a feather when they told me that."
Miss Rose,"I, too am a big fan. And that final scene got to me too. I listened to the audiobook the show is based on. There’s also a follow up book which isn’t covered by the show."
Miss Rose,"I will always weep at the end of Six Feet Under. 

I still think it’s the best show ever made, and there’s some fantastic shit out there"
Miss Rose,People who brag about how unaffected they are by media are douchebags. People who describe themselves as stoic or steely are *insufferable* douchebags. 100% of the time.
Miss Rose,Just thought I'd mention that The Singing Detective and How Green Was My Valley (along with the original adaptation of Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy) will apparently all be shown on BBC4 in the near future.
Miss Rose,"Thank you so much for the detailed post, this is exactly what I was looing for. I'll be sure to work through these recommendations."
Miss Rose,"Oh, that looks like it's right up my alley. Thanks for the recommendation."
Miss Rose,"...also the sequel, [*Smiley's People*](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0083480/reference/)*.* Where, if you're very very observant, you can spot Alan Rickman in a tiny walk-on role."
Miss Rose,[deleted]
Miss Rose,"Why it scared the bejeezus out of me that it looked for a while like we were going to get [a movie with Leonardo DiCaprio as Claudius, and then later that Jane Tranter had signed on to remake it for HBO/BBC](https://www.digitalspy.com/tv/ustv/a324321/i-claudius-to-be-remade-by-hbo-and-bbc/)."
Miss Rose,The show is practically a who's who of any British actor that went on to do interesting TV/film stuff in the 70's and 80's. You will notice a lot of familiar faces appear as the series progresses.
Miss Rose,"It actually adapted both of the Graves novels: *I, Claudius* and *Claudius the God.*  The screenplay was by [Jack Pulman](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0700474/), and at the time, the production drew a lot of critical flak for using modern idiomatic English in a historical drama, rather than ""period speak"", but it's what Graves did in the books, riffing off Suetonius.

I also fondly remember the 20th (or maybe 25th) anniversary *Masterpiece Theatre* special where Alistair Cooke called it ""a brilliant piece of pornography""; John Hurt on  Caligula: ""He's sort of the Method actor's nightmare, isn't he?—how do I identify?!—YOU CAN'T!!""; and Derek Jacobi fondly reminisced about how Peter O'Toole (married to Sian Phillips at the time) had come to the set and watched some of it, and pronounced, ""It's not going to get very good reviews—but *millions* are going to watch it.""

It was, essentially, the *Game of Thrones* of its day. :D"
Miss Rose,"I thought so too at first, but his force of personality won me over."
Miss Rose,"I didn't love the Sybil prophecy parts either, it was an overly deterministic reading of Julio-Claudian history. Thankfully it's only a small part of the show."
Miss Rose,"“Rosie Fingers of Dawn” — I don’t get the reference to Claudius. Was this an episode, or another show?"
Miss Rose,Love that line.
Miss Rose,"Niiiice! I don't think I've seen *Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy* since it originally aired.  Hopefully there'll be enough response that BBC4 will follow-up with *Smiley's People,* where you can (barely) catch a glimpse of Alan Rickman in a tiny walk-on role.

It always cracks me up how in the recent film adaptation of *Tinker Tailor* Gary Oldman isn't playing Smiley so much as he's playing Alec Guinness playing Smiley. :D"
Miss Rose,"Threads is also incredible. It's a mini series which very realistically displays what happens if a nuclear detonation happens on UK soil.

It's bleak in all the right ways. Earlier than this is the Quatermass experiment 2+3. They're done on a short budget but the storytelling and acting is amazing."
Miss Rose,"You're welcome! British TV was my obsession in the '80s/90s as a kid in Southern California when I was addicted to *Masterpiece Theatre*.  Nice to know my ancient knowledge :) can come in handy for a newer viewer.

One of the reasons why the tv of this period works a specific way is mostly because there wasn't a lot of money spent on production, because PAL and NTSC would be roughly equivalent to 480p resolution these days in 4:3 aspect ratio. TV was seen as the much cheaper secondary cousin to theatrical film.

All these shows were shot on (analog) video; or a mix of film (exteriors) and video (interiors).  And if film *was* used throughout (say, *Brideshead Revisited* or *Sherlock Holmes)* it was 16mm, not 35mm because broadcast resolution was so low.  And a lot more of the budget went into the writing and casting.  So you get this magical combination of very high levels of writing with very high levels of acting, but with sort of crap production quality \[see also Neil Gaiman's [*Neverwhere*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BB0N01U0XR4) (which was the basis for the novel, btw, not the other way around)*,* where he says even using the real lions in Trafalgar Square ended up looking like cheap props\]*.*

And unlike US tv at the time, UK television tended to be shaped by a single writer for a shorter-run series (e.g., John Mortimer and *Rumpole of the Bailey,* or Jack Pulman writing all of *I, Claudius)*.  The standard season length was 13 episodes, usually broadcast  in two blocks of about 6 or 7 episodes each.  IOW, what streaming shows are doing today.  And it was PBS importing this stuff over on *Masterpiece Theatre* that gave rise to the miniseries in US tv.

And a lot of the television writers of this period were also successful novelists or playwrights in their own right, set to adapting classic literary novels. For example, the 1980 BBC adaptation of *Pride & Prejudice* was done by Fay Weldon, and there's an adaptation of Jerome K. Jerome's *Three Men in a Boat* that was done by Tom Stoppard.

Also, Terry Nation mentioned that back then the BBC would have a much larger budget for casting so that casting directors could comb through every drama school and regional production to find unknowns that would be perfectly cast for a specific role.  He reckoned that the 1987 *Vanity Fair* was the last production that did that. I'd have to agree: it was *perfectly* adapted and cast. (BTW, the screenwriter was Alexander Baron, who also came in as a ringer to write the pilot episode of Hawkesworth's *Sherlock Holmes* (""A Scandal in Bohemia""), and is possibly the *only* adapter I know of who actually got that *Jane Eyre* is not *Wuthering Heights* and that bits of it are supremely funny with his 1980s adaptation (the one where Timothy Dalton is Rochester). It's the **only** adaptation I know of that *kept* the lines: ""Am I hideous, Jane?"" ""Very, sir: you always were, you know."")

Miss Rose,"interesting!

I recently re-read the book, but it was 25 years ago I saw the series... perhaps I should re-watch it :)"
Miss Rose,It was the song Caligula danced to when he had Claudius dragged out of bed and brought to the palace.
Miss Rose,Got it. Thanks!
Miss Rose,holy shit who cares this much. honestly. write an ebook. you're 50% done.
Miss Rose,JHC
Miss Rose,"TL;DR

My thoughts on the “nostalgia argument” as you call it, is it’s a genetic fallacy. You try to explain how and why someone has a position instead of addressing the position on its own merits. Instead of saying “you like x because you watched it when you were little” you should just say why you think it’s bad when viewed with a critical lens."
Miss Rose,Tldr
Miss Rose,k
Miss Rose,"People are already downvoting me without having read even 1/10 of what I wrote. A post that I put so much attention, care and months writing, analysing, and thinking deeply about..."
Miss Rose,What does this mean? What is JHC? I really don't know.
Miss Rose,"I'll tell something I experienced about Super Mario Bros. 3. It's a 2D platformer that is widely hailed as a masterpiece, one of the greatest 2D platformers ever made. I said to a person online that I consider it a truly great game. He immediately attacked me, saying ""you're blind by nostalgia, take off your rose-tinted glasses"". I have no nostalgia for Mario 3, played it for the first time a few years ago, I told him so, and he went back in his criticism. But if I hadn't, he was basically going to call me out on my love for the game! Actually, he had already called me out for loving the game, and he assumed that I was nostalgic for it! But even if had very strong nostalgia for it, he would still be wrong in criticizing my high praise for the game! Even if I was nostalgic towards it, nostalgia shouldn't suddenly make my judgment and love towards it less valid and less well-thought. As if I have no critical sense, as if I don't understand and deeply scrutinize what I love, and I know why I love it, why it deserves MY love and praise! This is why I think that people who say things such as ""it's not as good as you think"" and ""you just have nostalgia goggles"" are assholes.

I highly recommend this video essay.

EDIT: Why was I downvoted?"
Miss Rose,Welcome to the internet
Miss Rose,Months 😳😳😳
Miss Rose,"Jesus H Christ. 

As in ""Jesus H Christ, this is a long post!"""
Miss Rose,"I guess I overestimate the extent to which people online are willing to have long articulated discussions. For many, it's all about superficial shock, and disrespect and arrogance."
Miss Rose,Yes
Miss Rose,"Thanks for answering my doubt.

EDIT: Geez, I just thanked him, why the downvotes?"
Miss Rose,Damn
Miss Rose,"I know. If you would be willing to read my entire OP (I know it's long, but I feel like I had to write all that, though of course you aren't obligated to read it), please say what you think of all I wrote in this thread, and about my replies in the comment section too. I would love that."
Miss Rose,"I could immediately tell you were an Avatar fan from the title.

I read half the post but it's longer than expected.

People are allowed to like what they like doesn't matter the genre or target audience. Everyone is looking for different things and the main purpose of these shows is entertainment. So whatever you find the most entertaining would be your favourite show and you shouldn't feel influenced by others opinion's. Although it's easier said than done even I often let other's opinions influence my own. The ""best"" shows are all subjective."
Miss Rose,Have the people downvoting bothered to read at least half of this OP? I don't think I was unreasonable in my writing.
Miss Rose,Loud house was banned for homosexuality. No dip Sherlock
Miss Rose,"Seconded\^

You're allowed to like something, don't let anyone convince you otherwise."
Miss Rose,"I'm a fan of a lot of kids' shows. I love Avatar, but there are other kids' shows I love just as much. What made you think I had to be specifically an Avatar fan based only on the title? I'm curious.

I believe in maximum art plurality, including art that is not for me. Taste is very subjective, hence why I never use the word ""overrated"". And also why any list of best shows is always gonna piss off some people, but it shouldn't.

My problem with people who don't like a show that happens to be a kids' show is that they are arrogant and condescending. They say stuff like ""how could adults like and recommend this?"", or ""You must be infantile, a man-child to enjoy this"", and more. Those people also seem to hate children as protagonists, and complain about kids acting like kids! Those people also seem to be devoid of sense of wonder.

If people are not a fan of a horror movie, they don't bash the genre and/or fans of it. 

People should stop being judgmental over what art deeply touches and moves someone else.

EDIT: Why the downvotes?"
Miss Rose,What do you mean with this comment?
Miss Rose,">What made you think I had to be specifically an Avatar fan based only on the title? I'm curious.

I've been a fan of Avatar since it first ever came out, it's my all time favourite show.

I thought you were an Avatar fan from the title because a lot of Avatar fans have the need for everyone to accept the show as one of the best things ever created many of them also get upset whenever anyone calls it a ""kids show,"" which leads them to making posts like these.

>. They say stuff like ""how could adults like and recommend this?"", or ""You must be infantile, a man-child to enjoy this"", and more. Those people also seem to hate children as protagonists, and complain about kids acting like kids! Those people also seem to be devoid of sense of wonder.

I've definitely seen a lot of people act like that. You can't really do anything about it except allow them to eventually find a show that challenges their preconceived opinions.

>EDIT: Why the downvote?

Wasn't me."
Miss Rose,"Avatar is a kids' show, and I don't like Avatar fans defending it by saying ""it's a kids' show"". Kids' shows shouldn't be seen as inferior. I primarily love great kids' shows overall.

EDIT: Why the downvote? I'm an Avatar fan!"
Miss Rose,Only if we get to see gimple return to the character by having him team with Rick grimes as a 45 year old safety patrolman
Miss Rose,The amount of effort you put into that cast list....
Miss Rose,the fuck is fillmore?
Miss Rose,"Breaking Bad is a little shocking, don't know what they would have to talk about, unless it's somewhat a Better Call Saul gathering place too. Interesting to see the shows that have been done for awhile that still have legs/committed fans."
Miss Rose,"I don’t know if you consider r/freefolk a tv sub, but it would be 9 on this list at about 560k members"
Youre My Destiny,Jason Segal was almost the reason How I Met Your Mother ended
Youre My Destiny,Another Slapsgiving episode?
Youre My Destiny,It's 2023. The Mother passes away next year. It'd be nice to see some closure on that.
Youre My Destiny,I love these ‘actor shows interest in working and getting paid’ insights.
Youre My Destiny,Freaks and geeks season 2
Youre My Destiny,"I never finished the show during the original run and I'm about half way through at the moment and all I can think is ""what the fuck is that screenshot"""
Youre My Destiny,"HIMYF is pretty standard to me; HIMYM was never a knee-slapping romp anyway.  Where HIMYF does fall short is that it doesn’t have a bigger-than-life breakout character that captures the public’s attention like Barney did (and while I didn’t see last week’s episode, I’m not sure how much actual Barney can help).  I do like how HIMYF is keeping things simple, with the scaled down 10 eps per season streaming structure and the deliberate narrowing down of possible “father candidates,” so, unlike HIMYM, the titular character just can’t show up out of left field one day.  We won’t have to deal with 9 years and 208 episodes of Sophie Tompkins."
Youre My Destiny,"I watched the entire first season of HIMYF on a hangover day, it's terrible. I can't remember a single thing about it except that Hilary Duff was in it"
Youre My Destiny,"My first thought for a Marshall cameo would be Sophie ending up in front of him in court, but he's been a justice on the NY State Supreme Court since 2020, so that scenario seems unlikely.  It'll most likely be Marshall and Lily either checking out the old apartment, since that's where Sid and Jesse live, or a run in at McClaren's, like Robin."
Youre My Destiny,"Maybe they’ll do a scene where he steals someone’s cake, and lies about it despite having cake on his face

Edit: thanks for the award! Glad people remember the reference"
Youre My Destiny,"A run in at the Minnesota Vikings bar, just don't mention Gary Anderson or tell them that you are Canadian."
Youre My Destiny,show takes a turn towards the dramatic when its revealed Marshall has multiple families
Youre My Destiny,COME AGAIN FOR BIG FUDGE
Youre My Destiny,I love the cameos they’ve done thus far. Seeing Marshall and Lily would probably be the next major one then maybe in season 4 we see Ted
Youre My Destiny,I’m excited for his new show on Apple TV
Youre My Destiny,Am i a maaaaaaaan? Or am i a mupppeeet?
Youre My Destiny,The show is *GÁRBÁGE*
Youre My Destiny,Ashton Kutcher and Mila Kunis said the same thing about returning for That 90's Show. Everything they have is because of That 70's Show so they felt like they needed to return if asked.
Youre My Destiny,"He shit talked the show quite a bit during the original run. Hindsight is 20/20, I suppose."
Youre My Destiny,He should play a judge!
Youre My Destiny,"He was one of the best things about that show.. Neil Patrick Harris, Alyson Hannigan and Jason Segel. They were why we watched.. 11/10"
Youre My Destiny,The first 2 seasons of HIMYM were great. After that each season got worse. I remember a bit from an episode where the whole gag was that Marshal forgot his pants and Barney couldn't stop laughing.
Youre My Destiny,I worked with a young woman who met him when he came to our town to push a book he wrote.  This was about 5-6 years ago.  She actually slipped him her number and they had a back and forth sexting thing going on.
Youre My Destiny,So who did he end up with anyway?
Youre My Destiny,Is how I met your father the story of how the mother from how I met your mother met the father?
Youre My Destiny,Interesting. Seemed like he was pretty over himym as it was wrapping up. Didn’t he hold out on last season?
Youre My Destiny,Pretty rich from the guy who phoned in the entire last season.
Youre My Destiny,How I met your Father is TERRIBLE though. He needs to watch the pilot.
Youre My Destiny,I want get interviewed for potential jobs I’d like to do and have articles written about them.
Youre My Destiny,Nobody cares.
Youre My Destiny,[deleted]
Youre My Destiny,"No, thanks"
Youre My Destiny,"Jason Segel's acting philosophy is ""walked in from the street"" to me. He says words. Technically it's acting."
Youre My Destiny,Jason Segal is a trash human.
Youre My Destiny,"It wasn't till HIMYM was almost over that I found out Segal was in the show, never would have pictured him in a sitcom from watching his movies back in the day"
Youre My Destiny,No shit?
Youre My Destiny,Still sad he never ate Dog Shirt's picture
Youre My Destiny,How I Met Your Father ? 😬
Youre My Destiny,"I met this man in philly, what an angel"
Youre My Destiny,While i found zero reason to continue watching HIMYF I get where Segel is coming from and knowing how to appreciate something that has helped define your career.
Youre My Destiny,Surprised me. He was the first who wanted to wuit HIMYM back then.
Youre My Destiny,How does Jonah Hills new film mean he's down for HIMYF?
Youre My Destiny,Doesn’t matter no will see it. People hated the ending so much it cursed the spin offs.
Youre My Destiny,"is HIMYF any good?  I've not really heard anything good or bad about it, so I'm guessing it's fairly mediocre?"
Youre My Destiny,“Those people…” 🙄
Youre My Destiny,"I have no idea why people liked this show, it was absolute garbage."
Youre My Destiny,I hope one of the himyf crew gets a ticket or gets arrested and has to appear in front of Judge Fudge.
Youre My Destiny,"That show needs something because it lacks everything that made How I Met Your Mother so compelling. I honestly think they should have done it from The Mother's perspective as she's laying in the hospital before she passes away. That would have made a more compelling show than having a show that is set in the same location as the previous, with no connection to the original other than side characters existing due to it taking place in the same area."
Youre My Destiny,How so?
Youre My Destiny,"Then thank you Jason.

That show went on like 4 season too long"
Youre My Destiny,"Slaps, “sandwiches”, and Barney’s catch phrases…."
Youre My Destiny,"The slaps were a great mechanic to write around. It did eventually get a little long in the tooth, but the first few bits they did of it was hysterical."
Youre My Destiny,I feel like it would be something related to him being a judge for a character's legal issue.
Youre My Destiny,Or we can just pretend that never happens.
Youre My Destiny,"Not watching the show, are they actually connected? Is it Barney's daughter's story?"
Youre My Destiny,[deleted]
Youre My Destiny,"The best one was yesterday I saw Eddie Murphy was really down for making a Donkey movie, yeah like no shit mate. Get paid millions to record a voice in a booth…who wouldn’t be up for that."
Youre My Destiny,"Timothy Chamelet interested in doing “Dune” sequel.

Human interested in having cheeseburger again later because they die if they don’t eat every so often."
Youre My Destiny,Buzz probably helps the studios gage interest.
Youre My Destiny,"Tobey Maguire is open to wear spiderman suit if Disney offers the role!

You know what, people are mostly open to make millions of dollars. How surprising!"
Youre My Destiny,"jason segel hasn't been in anything in ages. Only recently did i see him in an ad for something on streaming. Even if your big mansion in malibu is all paid for and you can eat fining dining every day for the rest of your days, the irrelevence must get to everyone."
Youre My Destiny,"Especially since he was sick of the show by the end and wanted out. He was the only person who was holding out for the last tacked on season and finally relented. I guess when work dries up after the show. Suddenly they’re cool with that show that helped them buy things. 

Reminds me of an article about Daisy Ridley is up to returning to Star Wars. 

It’s “actor is up for doing work. Filmed at 11”"
Youre My Destiny,Be still my beating heart.
Youre My Destiny,I'd love it if they did a Freaks and Geeks season 2 that was like the Wet Hot American Summer prequel series - everybody is visibly 20 years older but everyone is still acting like they're all teenagers.
Youre My Destiny,If you want to know it's an episode of the season 9.
Youre My Destiny,That’s Marshall and the Night Falcon. Don’t ask.
Youre My Destiny,No questions asked.
Youre My Destiny,"> HIMYM was never a knee-slapping romp anyway.

It was a nice, goofy show. Didn't take itself seriously. Good Monday night fodder. 

The whole lineup around 2009 on CBS on Mondays worked - those shows taken together were better than they were separately."
Youre My Destiny,"It’s not that it lacks a “breakout character,” it’s that it lacks the situational comedy of the old show. The old show had a format where in most episodes early on

* The gang is all hanging out together  
* Someone shares a story about their life  
* One of the group says “oh yeah” and introduces concept X, a new one each episode  
* The remaining episode is situational comedy playing out concept X

The reason why people loved Barney is that he frequently got to be the guy introducing some of the series’ funniest concepts. But most episodes were like this, and they’d spread it around.

The new show has none of this. It’s not that they do it and it misses - they don’t even really try. The *pilot* of HIMYM has Ted explaining “olive theory” to his friends, the conceptual stuff is in the show from the very beginning. In all of the first season of HIMYF they don’t even dip into this style, and so it lacks the most distinctive part of HIMYF. It can work without NPH, it just can’t work without any of the types of jokes people loved."
Youre My Destiny,"> I do like how HIMYF is keeping things simple, with the scaled down 10 eps per season

Season 2 is going to be 20 episodes."
Youre My Destiny,Actually season 2 is 20 episodes long
Youre My Destiny,Barney as a character has also really not aged well.
Youre My Destiny,"Schlocky comedy like this really need to have the audience relating to the situation. I couldn't relate at all to the main character or Barney so it's kind of lost on me. Everybody loves Raymond does, however."
Youre My Destiny,"What really need and what how I met your mother sold me aside of Barnie, was the websites they did like www.tedmosbyisajerk.com or http://tedmosbyisnotajerk.com http://www.guyforceshiswifetodressinagarbagebagforthenextthreeyears.com/"
Youre My Destiny,[deleted]
Youre My Destiny,"It’s sort of like HIMYM or FRIENDS. Without the cult like following. I do not look at these shows as “substance” or “gripping” or take them seriously. I look at them as “fluff,” background tv that is low commitment, zero stress, doesn’t force you to think, just like”brain drain” ambient shows. Just…..easy. Predictable. A break from daily news intensity or a day of heavy work brain engagement. You’re gonna be disappointed if you think it’s supposed to be awesome acting, riveting plotlines, deeply transformative character arcs, etc. just a cheesy, goofy characters, dorky dialogue, simple sitcom. That’s ok.

Check out this article from the New Yorker: [““Emily in Paris” and the Rise of Ambient TV”](https://12ft.io/proxy?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newyorker.com%2Fculture%2Fcultural-comment%2Femily-in-paris-and-the-rise-of-ambient-tv)

“As with soaps and chores, the current flow of ambient television provides a numbing backdrop to the rest of our digital consumption: feeds of fragmented text, imagery, and video algorithmically sorted to be as provocative as possible. Ambience offers the increasingly rare possibility of disengagement while still staring at a screen.”

This is how I see this show.

Edit: hijacking my own comment to add a couple articles folks may be interested in: [Cracking the Sitcom Code -The Atlantic](https://12ft.io/proxy?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theatlantic.com%2Fentertainment%2Farchive%2F2014%2F12%2Fcracking-the-sitcom-code%2F384068%2F)

“There are a great deal of things that we do not at all feel compelled to re-watch or re-read, particularly in a world in which we have access to virtually limitless entertainment and cultural material. The things that we do feel compelled to re-watch or re-read are those that provide us with either comfort or perspective”"
Youre My Destiny,"It’s fine, but it completely misses the vibe of the original series."
Youre My Destiny,"The NY State Supreme Court is the trial-level court of general jurisdiction (not the highest level), and justices are elected to 14-year terms, so that would still work."
Youre My Destiny,The naming structure in New York is a bit backwards to most other states. New York Court of Appeals is the highest Court in NY. The Supreme Court of New York is just beneath.
Youre My Destiny,“It’s MY birthday!”
Youre My Destiny,Jon heder playing narshall
Youre My Destiny,"Ted won’t do it, pretty sure he’s gone on the record and said that"
Youre My Destiny,I watched the two eps that are out and definitely enjoyed it so far
Youre My Destiny,"They could have easily fired Mila Kunis when they found out she was still underaged and didn't. And I'll go out on a limb and say that their relationship together would be entirely different if they weren't working on the same show for years of their life. Yeah, it makes sense they'd be super greatful to everyone running the show."
Youre My Destiny,I think I remember him being the last cast member to sign a contract in the later seasons so I wouldn’t be surprised if it was a negotiation tactic.
Youre My Destiny,I recall him saying he didn't  be doing a sitcom as the same character for a decade. You can't really blame him.  It can be very limiting to a young actor.
Youre My Destiny,What did he say about it?
Youre My Destiny,The show didn’t even hit its stride until the 2nd or 3rd season lol. The shows peak is like 3rd-6th seasons.
Youre My Destiny,"Yeah - there was a post some years ago about how he tends to solicit girls at Starbucks. I just checked the comments to see if anyone said anything like that again, and here we are..."
Youre My Destiny,The boats boats boats girl
Youre My Destiny,No.
Youre My Destiny,"No, it's about how a completely unrelated character in the HIMYM universe, who never appeared in HIMYM, met her husband years after the events of HIMYM."
Youre My Destiny,He did
Youre My Destiny,"He's doing ok, currently leading a show with harrison ford on apple tv."
Youre My Destiny,"He's also a raging alcoholic/ sloppy drunk. And while he was in town filmint, he hit on every female bartender to the point where the community was collectively uniting against him.  Dude is a mess, hides behind this nice guy act.  It's sad."
Youre My Destiny,"The first season is fairly bad, IMO. It's basically a sillier Friends-clone set in the HIMYM universe that's less funny and less well-written. None of the things that make HIMYM special (the way it plays with time, fantasy, reality, continuity, destiny, and meta are just barely present in HIMYF). They start to come in at the very end of the first season, and the Season 2 premiere does feature some play with time, but HIMYF is very HIMYM-lite as of right now. I *really* want to like it, so I keep giving it chances, but they really need to overhaul the show to make it good. I'm hopeful Season 2 can do that for the show, but not expecting it."
Youre My Destiny,He didn't want to do Season 9 when the rest of the cast did.
Youre My Destiny,The first slap bet episode is one of my favorite sitcom episodes ever
Youre My Destiny,The whole episode about the slap of a ~~thousand~~ million exploding suns was fucking aces.
Youre My Destiny,That last one was awesome though!
Queen of No Marriage,"I know hes done a lot of stuff over the years, but his appareance on [It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia](https://youtu.be/-U1yb7PQw4o) is one of the funniest things I've ever seen and I will always remember him for it."
Queen of No Marriage,"Despite a chaotic life w/ severe issues, & wandering through substance abuse a few times, he is & was a creative talent & strong screen presence. Today my intent is to recall where I’ve seen him in the screen.

He was always a great supporting character. 

Born on the Fourth of July (1989), Harley Davidson and the Marlboro Man (1991), Passenger 57 (1992), True Romance (1993), Natural Born Killers (1994), Strange Days (1995), Heat (1995), Saving Private Ryan (1998), Red Planet (2000), Black Hawk Down (2001), Pearl Harbor (2001) and the revival television series Twin Peaks (2017), and for voicing Sonny Forelli in the video game Grand Theft Auto: Vice City.

Very sad to hear doctors saying there is no hope for Sizemore to rebound from the aneurysm & stroke. God bless, hope he is feeling comfortable, safe & loved."
Queen of No Marriage,"Brain aneurysms are terrifying. A kid in high school started complaining of a headache one morning. Bad enough to go to the nurse by lunch. You could hear him crying out in pain by the end of lunch (it was a small school). He was dead by that evening. 

Any time I’ve gotten a serious headache since I hear his cries echoing down the school hallway (it was a small school, we had one hallway)."
Queen of No Marriage,"""For me, the action is the juice."""
Queen of No Marriage,"There was this moment on Celebrity Rehab Season 3 where Tom was bawling while watching a video showing everyone in rehab when they were young. While he's being comforted he cries ""did you see how young we used to be? did you see how young we used to be?""

The way he was clearly mourning both youth, innocence, and everything he had lost during his life shook me as a kid. A haunting mix of crushing regret and amazement at remembering who he once was."
Queen of No Marriage,My sister met him at a half way house visiting her friend going through something similar around like 2003/2004.She said  he was very kind and gave her a very  dated headshot with him on a Harley and signed it for her. Dudes a tortured artist addiction sucks and when you think your in the clear health complications come at you.
Queen of No Marriage,"Well, that's certainly sad news. :("
Queen of No Marriage,Most recently saw him in a rep screening of Strange Days. Fucking presence and a half. This sucks.
Queen of No Marriage,I still remember him acting alongside Johnny Knoxville in *Big Trouble*. It was always such a fun movie and he really owned his scenes.
Queen of No Marriage,"The interview he did on Howard Stern around...2007? Maybe ? Where he is obviously on or comming off something was a shame to see . ( they used to show some interviews of the Stern show on a video subscription service ) . He had sweated through his dress shirt so badly they gave him a new one mid interview.

He was such a great actor . Great in Private Ryan."
Queen of No Marriage,He is so god damn funny in True Romance for few minutes of screen time he has
Queen of No Marriage,"Such a huge screen presence and immensely talented dude, all struggles aside. So bummed for him and his family but grateful for all his great work he shared with us."
Queen of No Marriage,Sad news :(
Queen of No Marriage,RIP
Queen of No Marriage,"Damn. I thought he’d at least outlive Gary Busey. Great actor, wish he had beaten his demons"
Queen of No Marriage,"I know he had his personal demons but damn what an ugly way to go, especially at age 61. RIP Tom."
Queen of No Marriage,""" For me, the Action is the Juice""- Michael Cherrito


When I look back at his body of work, I am astounded at all the amazing films he was a part of. RIP a true badass. 


What an amazing career."
Queen of No Marriage,The dude had some severe abise problems. On Celebrity rehab he was down pretty bad
Queen of No Marriage,"""Captain, if your mother saw you do that, she'd be very upset..... """
Queen of No Marriage,RIP to Nick mullens dear friend
Queen of No Marriage,Tom Sizemore made acting look easy. Such an amazing talent like he wasn’t even trying as he played great supporting character after character in so many movies. His onscreen chemistry with Tom Hanks in Saving Private Ryan is a masterclass for anyone aspiring to be a great supporting actor. I’m going to miss seeing this guy onscreen. After his lowest low he worked hard to keep it clean for many years. That should be an inspiration in it of itself for many struggling today.
Queen of No Marriage,Rest In Peace Sarge.
Queen of No Marriage,"Yesterday I was watching ""Saving Private Ryan"" and today this news."
Queen of No Marriage,"For as troubled of a life as he lived, he still managed to make it to 61. I know that’s still pretty young, but I doubt that he ever expected to make it to this age. I hope that the stigma of his substance abuse and addiction will fade and that the true brilliance of his ability will forever shine as his legacy. I hope and wish that his passing is as pain free and peaceful as possible. ❤️"
Queen of No Marriage,"Lana: What's your third biggest fear? 
 
Archer: Brain aneurysm. 
 
Lana: What's a brain aneurysm have to do with walking around in a swamp? 
 
Archer: Nothing, it can happen anywhere at anytime, that's what makes it so terrifying"
Queen of No Marriage,"Whats more tragic, the news or OP karma whoring every big story on this subreddit. Like it’s seriously all the top page news is by one user"
Queen of No Marriage,RIP.. Some people just have IT. Whatever IT is you notice it immediately and never forget it. He probably could have been as big as any actor of his time if it weren't for his demons. But maybe that's what makes them great... Not unlike Philip Seymour Hoffman.
Queen of No Marriage,"Thats sad to hear :(

I spent many hours editing his dialogue for an indie film “Durants Never Closes” (last check was on prime video). The set was in an echo chamber and writing was low low budget, but Tom’s performance was great.

I forced my friends to watch it and suffer some of my pain"
Queen of No Marriage,Black hawk down and saving private Ryan are 2 of my favourite films.. neither would be the same without him!
Queen of No Marriage,"Ah damn, fucking shame. I know the dude had crazy problems, I hope he had some peace in the past few years"
Queen of No Marriage,"That sucks but, if it is the right decision them they should be able to make it without any backlash."
Queen of No Marriage,Any day you can go. It’s just the reality of life. We aren’t going to make it.
Queen of No Marriage,"Well talk about highs and lows, from being a great supporting actor, to drugs and being a porn star, he lived it all."
Queen of No Marriage,"This is how my dad died, it's such a traumatic experience for the family so my thoughts are with them. I'll always love him for his roles, especially as Milo in Heart and Soul is where I first saw him as a kid.

Especially this iconic scene: https://youtu.be/65eOaOTeyng"
Queen of No Marriage,"61 years old, crap. That's pretty much my age..."
Queen of No Marriage,He was one of the most underrated actors of his generation. NBK would be nothing without him.
Queen of No Marriage,"First noticed him in Devil In A Blue Dress. After that I looked for Tom Sizemore credits in movies. If he was in it, I was watching it. I’m amazed how many really good movies he’s in.

He’s already missed."
Queen of No Marriage,True romance. Stand out performance. Surprised more people haven't seen that movie.
Queen of No Marriage,Man had a rough life. Very sad.
Queen of No Marriage,"“Well ya know, for me, the action is the juice. I’m in.”

https://youtu.be/t2ojmr1gDrY"
Queen of No Marriage,Nothing takes 5 minutes.
Queen of No Marriage,"“ I like this Clarence kid, this f*cking guy is crazy!”"
Queen of No Marriage,I saw him way back on the celebrity rehab show. Heartbreaking
Queen of No Marriage,"“I gotta a pocket full of cash and a heart full of desire.. it’s like a mailbox, you open it up and put whatever you want inside.” His always sunny appearance is something I’ll never forget"
Queen of No Marriage,Damn. That’s awful. He’s probably my favorite character in Saving Private Ryan.
Queen of No Marriage,"He's a really great actor, even though he wasn't a major star his screen presence was undeniable. Loved him in enemy of the state and saving private Ryan."
Queen of No Marriage,Really liked him in black hawk down and saving private ryan
Queen of No Marriage,Sizemore was so GOOD. I don't understand how he was so wasted most of the time but shooting a movie he was great. He worked a lot too.
Queen of No Marriage,Damn I knew Major Toms brain would eventually explode from all the blow he did
Queen of No Marriage,How come no one’s mentioned his XXX career? He brought a professionalism into porn like Felini  in 9mm
Queen of No Marriage,Karma finally came to claim him. I have no sympathy for domestic abusers.
Queen of No Marriage,A voice of my childhood. That was my money Tommy!
Queen of No Marriage,"No matter his past issues,he is/was a talented actor.My 2 Favorite roles were in Heat and SPR.He always played the badass/No BS characters who had their bosses back,like the way Horvath went after Reiben.Top Honorable Mention goes to his part in Black Hawk Down as the Commander.Very sad news."
Queen of No Marriage,His cameo in Its Always Sunny In Philadelphia was funny as hell.
Queen of No Marriage,"Damn, didn’t even know he was hospitalized."
Queen of No Marriage,This deeply saddens me. I just watched Strange Days for the first time Saturday. Had no idea he had such a large role. Killer flick
Queen of No Marriage,"Loved him in The Relic as the superstitious detective in Chicago, or with Robert Downey Jr in Hearts and Souls."
Queen of No Marriage,RIP Tommy
Queen of No Marriage,"Oh man, Sgagnetti!"
Queen of No Marriage,"Great actor, troubled man. I enjoyed his performances but wish he had found peace."
Queen of No Marriage,"I remember the utter crucifixion this guy went through whenever he was going through the worst parts of his struggle with addiction. He was a great actor, had some personal demons, but his actions then seem to kinda pale in comparison to what some actors do these days and get away with with seemingly nothing more than a slap on the wrist from production teams."
Queen of No Marriage,"This is sad. I know he had his issues but some of his body of work is fantastic. I loved him as The Gent in Hellride.

[EDIT] Omg, I'm an idiot. That was Michael Madson and not Tom. Regardless, Tom was great."
Queen of No Marriage,darn 61 is too young for anyone
Queen of No Marriage,A friend of mine died in the 5th grade from one of these. Still can hit home as we weren’t ready for that kind of thing at age 10-11.
Queen of No Marriage,"True Romance, Natural Born Killers, Heat, Saving Private Ryan, Black Hawk Down, Enemy of the State....etc....no matter how big or small the role, he always was 100% and was always memorable.  It's so awful how addiction got a hold of him and just wouldn't let go. I have always rooted for him."
Queen of No Marriage,I thought he was dead long ago. Lots of addiction issues
Queen of No Marriage,"I will always remember his cameo in Point Break. The way he says ""3 months"" has been seared into my brain ever since I saw the film in the 90s. I also just watch The Relic where he plays one of the most believable cops to come out of the late 90s."
Queen of No Marriage,"He was so good in Saving Private Ryan, it’s sad to lose his talent"
Queen of No Marriage,Damn. He’s one of the best supporting actors in the business IMO. So many great films that his performances contributed to in a big way.
Queen of No Marriage,"A friend of mine directed a movie he was in about 5 or 6 years ago and had nothing but wonderful things to say. Even though it was a low budget horror flick, he treated it like any other movie and gave it his all."
Queen of No Marriage,Great actor.  I hope he found peace before the stroke.  I hope he knows how many fans he had of his work.
Queen of No Marriage,I’m not one who thinks someone should have their sins follow them the rest of their life - but I never looked at the guy the same after [this story was published.](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/general-news/tom-sizemore-was-removed-movie-set-allegedly-violating-11-year-old-girl-1057629/amp/)
Queen of No Marriage,Really enjoyed his performance in The Relic.
Queen of No Marriage,The family is asking for privacy at this time so we published an article detailing the private happenings and agonizing decision they’re being asked to make by doctors.
Queen of No Marriage,I have empathy for his family but not much else. He was a despicable human. There are credible accusations of him being asked to leave a production he was in after he molested an 11 year old girl with multiple witnesses present. And inb4 people say he struggled with addiction and had his demons; there’s no excuse for doing something like that.
Queen of No Marriage,"I can’t believe he has lived this long. Either way, thanks for entertaining us Tom."
Queen of No Marriage,"Ive always been torn because he’s in one of my fav movies, Strange Days. But he also molested a child and or children. So yeah…"
Queen of No Marriage,It’s sad that all his achievements are diminished by being an abuser.
Queen of No Marriage,Fuck this dude. He was a child molester
Queen of No Marriage,"Shame, great actor but also a real piece of shit."
Queen of No Marriage,"Everyone so torn up by this should look up his interactions with a little girl sitting on his lap during a photo shoot for a film some years back: “This is when Sizemore allegedly either rubbed his finger against the girl's vagina or inserted it inside.”

Oh yeah such a shame though."
Queen of No Marriage,"Spousal abuser and child molester. Honestly, pretty hard to have sympathy for the guy."
Queen of No Marriage,He's beaten his last girlfriend
Queen of No Marriage,"Sad news, but wanted to point out that Sizemore was also a spousal abuser. We can’t deify Sizemore on the one hand, while demonizing Chris Brown on the other. Sad news, loved the films he acted in, but this was also a man who beat women and I don’t fuck with people like that."
Queen of No Marriage,I can never see Tom Sizemore and not think of [the fart hole.](https://youtu.be/jYkdFS8n_GA)
Queen of No Marriage,Great actor. Shitty at being human. RIP
Queen of No Marriage,I always get Tom Sizemore and Michael Madsen mixed up.
Queen of No Marriage,Godspeed you legend. May we meet again on the celestial shores.
Queen of No Marriage,I’ll always remember him as the guy that banged Paris Hilton. Shine on you crazy diamond.
Queen of No Marriage,[deleted]
Queen of No Marriage,I thought he died years ago.  Sad either way.
Queen of No Marriage,"In 2000, my boss and good friend had a brain aneurysm.  It was catastrophic. Somehow, she lived, and had been in recovery since. She just began to release must've online, and I couldn't be more proud.

I'm going to call her this week."
Queen of No Marriage,I wanna be next
Queen of No Marriage,"He is a vegetable right now, his brain looks like mashed potatoes in an MRI. There's no reason to use machines to keep the rest of his organs going when his corpse would die without them."
Queen of No Marriage,Terrible news.  Love Tom’s various characters.  Truly a great actor.  My love and support ti his family during these difficult times
Queen of No Marriage,What's he been in?
Queen of No Marriage,Glad to know I still have 15 years to live
Queen of No Marriage,"Canadas MAID laws help in this situation.* Some People hit a point where their life will be endless hell till they die. Assisted Suicide is a compassionate thing to do. This Canadian supports it. It has its uses, people going out on their own terms, instead of being a potato, pooping their pants all day. 
We can help people.

*Edited to be less of a flippant ass and actually open conversation about the topic of Assisted Dieing."
Queen of No Marriage,The dude was a child molester. He’s lucky he didn’t die in prison.
Queen of No Marriage,"i always kind of liked him, until he picked up that kid to use as a shield in ""heat"".

condolences to his family."

Office Girls,"If you say anything negative about Arcane, The Leftovers, Mr Robot and Breaking Bad."
Office Girls,Any statement saying a TV show is *objectively* something. TV is a subjective art form - intelligent sounding words don't improve upon your point.
Office Girls,"I tend to shy away from saying, whenever *The Office* comes up and people come out saying how *Parks and Recreation* is underrated in comparison, how I feel that *30 Rock* is superior to both those shows."
Office Girls,"Positive comment about Rings of Power

Negative comment about House of the Dragons

Seriously when it was airing any mild criticism I had of House of the Dragon would get downvoted hard."
Office Girls,Streaming is amazing. I love it and it’s the best thing to ever happen to TV.
Office Girls,"Not a movie opinion, but I think a lot of people on Reddit are bitter and want to punish people. I see people getting downvoted for the dumbest things to the point of not showing up.

Someone said ""I liked X"". Wasn't a controversial movie or anything with 4 downvotes. Wtf? The up and downvote are supposed to be Is this contributing to the conversation? Not Do I agree with this?"
Office Girls,"I really liked Space Force, and was sad it was cancelled."
Office Girls,Raised by wolves wasn’t good enough to continue making new seasons on hbo. (I feel like I’m committing a sin just saying that. For give me Mother!)
Office Girls,Man in the high castle was incredibly boring and some of the worst pacing I've seen in a show.
Office Girls,Person Of Interest was better >!before the Machine Wars!< take over the plot.
Office Girls,The ending of Breaking Bad was feel-good in nature and went against the punishing narrative of everything up to that point.
Office Girls,This sub would be much better without hot take or under/overrated shitposts.
Office Girls,"Welcome to Reddit. Instant downvote on any positive thing said about a show that is not targeted at the 18-34 year old male demo. 

Worth remembering that r/television skews over 90% male in the demo."
Office Girls,Wandavision’s finale was fantastic
Office Girls,Scrubs Med School was actually good
Office Girls,I thought She Hulk was really good at what it was trying to be. Not my typical kind of genre but I enjoyed it.
Office Girls,"- Rings of Power is pretty good

- Henry Cavill is not that good of an actor, and reddit only likes him because hes very good looking and openly a nerd

- Santa Clauses is fun guilty pleasure schlock, and i cant wait for season 2"
Office Girls,The ending to Game of Thrones doesn't ruin the whole show or prevent me from recommending it to people who are getting into fantasy.
Office Girls,Liking Wheel of Time.
Office Girls,"The final episode of Lost remains one of the top 3 episodes of any TV show ever made. It was beautiful, emotional, provoking and perfect and I’ll stand by it to my grave. TO MY GRAVE GOOD SIR."
Office Girls,The White Lotus is overrated. I really didn’t care for how season 1 played out even though it had a great cast and some great characters.
Office Girls,"Stephen Colbert isn’t the least bit funny as himself, only when he was playing a character."
Office Girls,"I say it all the time and get downvoted: accuracy to source material in adaptations is severely overrated. Lore purists are toxic to their own enjoyment of the adaptations and also build up a toxic culture which turns off more casual viewers. Too many examples to name, it’s about half of all discussion on this subreddit"
Office Girls,Rick & Morty is cringey
Office Girls,I enjoyed both The Big Bang Theory *and* The Walking Dead.
Office Girls,"Not a problem here but the Succession subreddit will downvote you to oblivion for suggesting that Shiv Roy isn’t perfect or the best part of Succession. If you dislike her, you’re a misogynist piece of shit apparently.

[Literally today a guy got downvoted and told to fuck off for saying she wasn’t even in the top 3 best characters in the show.](https://www.reddit.com/r/SuccessionTV/comments/zoqi4v/why_is_shiv_the_best_character_on_the_show/j0oe9z6/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf&context=3)

And that’s not even addressing the creepy Shiv artwork and wishing the actress happy birthday posts and what not."
Office Girls,Seeing people get downvoted in this specific thread is hilarious .
Office Girls,The Office sucks.
Office Girls,I got downvoted for saying the actor / voice actor who won an award for voicing Kratos in the God of War game should be casted to play Kratos in the God of War show.
Office Girls,I expected more from sorting by controversial here.
Office Girls,"Fargo Season 1 is way better than Season 2. The only things I like about S2 was Mike Milligan and Hanzee. I’m not sure how much Reddit would disagree with that, but I see S2 called better and one of the best seasons of any show quite a bit on here."
Office Girls,THE FLY episode of BB is a legit bad artsy-fartsy wankfest and people only like it because they think they’re supposed to
Office Girls,The TV series Sense 8 was a convoluted and wishy washy mess with no real substance other than pushing social commentary at every opportunity.
Office Girls,I have Tried watching sopranos multiple times but i find season one so boring
Office Girls,"stranger things was only good for 1 season and should have ended at 3 seasons max.  


since i know whats coming rick sanchez said it best.  


your boos mean nothing ive seen what makes you cheer"
Office Girls,Ted Lasso is incredibly annoying!!
Office Girls,Say anything positive about Rings of Power or Wheel of Time.
Office Girls,"I thought The Wire was tremendously boring and couldn't get through more than a few episodes in two separate attempts. I really wanted to give it a chance. I thought many of the characters were the same broad stereotypes that have always made me dislike more-conventional cop shows. I couldn't get even remotely invested in anybody or anything that was going on. Every episode was a slog that felt *way* longer than an hour, and I couldn't stop my mind from wandering. I had to make myself watch the next episode and sometimes procrastinated on it for weeks or even months, until I finally decided it was pointless and I should just give up."
Office Girls,"Being critical of Legend of Korra's romance being often one sided, toxic, undeveloped.

Saying anything negative about those Star Wars shows.

Saying anything nice about She-Hulk.

Getting involved in discussions about subtitles being necessary vs being distracting.

Saying you like reality/competitive TV."
Office Girls,"As an English speaker, I will choose dubs over subtitles for pretty much everything 100% of the time. This includes anime. I would rather watch what’s going on and listen to the audio than be focused on reading all the time."
Office Girls,"Breaking Bad is much better than Better Call Saul, which is carried completely by the Nacho/Mike storyline."
Office Girls,Anything negative about Mr Roger's Neighborhood or  The Joy of Painting (Bob Ross)
Office Girls,Twin Peaks is too slow for its owm good.
Office Girls,I like Night Court and miss my Dad watching it.
Office Girls,Jennifer Coolidge is not a good actress. I loved both seasons of The White Lotus though.
Office Girls,Community was boring
Office Girls,"Echo chambers are pretty insanely localized and predictable. 

Pick a post, go down a comment thread that is ""pro"" and say something ""anti"", you'll get downvoted pretty systematically. Go do to an ""anti"" comment in the same thread that's getting some upvotes (bonus point if people are yelling at each other) and say something ""anti"" -> downvotes too."
Office Girls,"I always post this and I always get downvoted, but I feel very strongly about it. 

The Office (US) should have ended at the end of Season 3. 

> Just as Pam is telling the cameras that she accepts that she does not think that it would work out between her and Jim, he bursts into the room and asks her out to dinner. Stunned, she agrees, and Jim says, ""Alright. Then, it's a date."" After Jim exits the room, Pam becomes visibly joyous and forgets what she was talking about.

> During a phone call, David Wallace offers the job to Ryan Howard (B. J. Novak), who accepts and immediately breaks up with Kelly Kapoor (Mindy Kaling).

It would have been such a high point to end on."
Office Girls,House of Dragons season 1 wasn’t anything special.
Office Girls,New girl sucks
Office Girls,Anything positive about the Big Bang Theory
Office Girls,Any opinion. Positive or negative usually is downvoted
Office Girls,Lovecraft Country was not very good after the first episode and the cancellation was warranted.
Office Girls,Cathode ray tube TVs are the best.
Office Girls,"Brooklyn 99 feels like a children's show for adults. It's too cutesy. It's actually kind of annoying. Nobody in that show is funny except Samberg and Braugher. Dude that plays Boyle had his moments. Crews is funny in a a lot of roles but his line reading in that show is awful, you'd never think he'd been in Hollywood for like two decades. Plus the way his character is written sucks and having two bosses feels redundant. 

Gina sucked but we all know that 

Rosa was just. I don't know. I feel like the character never landed for me. It would be funny or interesting if the actress could really sell it but it came off like someone trying to be cool rather than someone genuinely being that way. 

Hitchcock and the Scully. Where to even begin. That fatter one is bad enough, but the bald one? Who thought that character was a good idea? Just a gross mean old guy that isn't funny at all? His mean spritedness doesn't jive with the rest of the show

And Amy. Oh man. I feel like the sitcom has always had so many formidable female actresses with Courtney Cox and Roseanne Barr and Poehler but Fumero is so bad. Not a comedic bone in her body.

The way most sitcoms work is that a handful of characters provide the comedy and then the rest sort of chip in here and there. The Office for example. It's Michael, Jim and Dwight, and then everyone else chips in when they need to. Here you have Samberg doing most of the work but there are so many other characters and they're tasked with carrying the comedic load and they drop the ball so hard so often it's insane.

I say all of this to say, I've watched the show plenty of times. As in right way through. Maybe four or five times over the years. Because it can be sort of nice to watch a show where everyone looks out for each other. It has that same feel good factor that Parks and Recs had without being nearly as funny and with all of the characters feeling like children. Parks and Recs they felt like crazy or eccentric adults. This show most of the characters feel like they're actually children. 

It's an enjoyable show, but it's not really good and it's far from funny. Very weak cast"
Office Girls,That The Office sucks.
Office Girls,Firefly is mid.
Office Girls,"Rings of Power, despite its occasional flaws, was one of my favorite shows this year."
Office Girls,"American comedies are usually far inferior to British ones, except for Its Always Sunny"
Office Girls,Lost is one of the greatest shows in the history of television and pioneered the modern dramatic Tv show.
Office Girls,Ken Jeong sucks
Office Girls,yellowstone season 5 is awful and taylor sheridan sucks at writing female characters
Office Girls,"* The Big Bang Theory is a perfectly fine sitcom that is ridiculously overhated. It won't win awards for its writing, but it's a harmless ""turn your brain off and watch something"" kind of show.
* Laugh tracks (or a live studio audience, which is actually much more common) don't bother me at all and can actually enhance certain moments. Think of how big a laugh the end of Seinfeld's ""Marine Biologist"" episode got or the ecstatic reaction on Friends when Monica and Chandler got together. Also, the whole ""remove the laugh track from this show and it's awkward"" thing is dumb because the whole show is specifically written and timed with the audience in mind. Timing is everything in comedy, so of course pausing for the audience is gonna be weird if you take them out.
* SNL is not ""horrible since *insert cast member here* left"". It's ALWAYS been hit and miss right from the beginning. Which makes sense given the pressure they're under to deliver numerous sketches every week. I don't care how good of a comedy writer you are, that kind of schedule means you're always going to have some clunkers."
Office Girls,"I like Amy Schumer and ""Inside Amy Schumer"" is a funny show

."
Office Girls,Anything created by Neil Gaiman is garbage.
Office Girls,I get downvoted every time I mention that “Breaking Bad” is one of the most overrated shows of all time.
Office Girls,Seal Team is one of my favorite shows.
Office Girls,"Andor is only like 5% better than the rest of the star wars garbage - making it the best of the bad, but not good."
Office Girls,"I love unsold pilots to failed sitcoms. theyre single serving sitcoms, very little commitment"
Office Girls,Yellowstone isn’t really good or have a good character study on multiple characters. Rip is clearly the best character but the overall story is boring and drawn out and not much happens. And my biggest complaint is that their aren’t any good bad guys or adversity for the main characters to go up against. It’s overall an average show that has great landscape shots the mid of the country likes. They needed to take more from breaking bad and how they develop enemies and criminal enterprises if we are to believe the Yellowstone is a criminal organization which it comes off as a mid tier barely illegal organization that is all talk and barely any action.
Office Girls,I enjoy Friends and the Big Bang Theory
Office Girls,"I don't like Succession. It's just people who shouldn't be saying ""fuck you"" to each other but the plot is always that they say ""fuck you"" to each other.

I don't like Andor. The main character is boring and the plot is tired."
Office Girls,"Maybe or maybe not, but The Expanse became much less interesting after season 3. I actually enjoyed season 4 but 5 and 6 were just kinda meh. Maybe it all plays better in the books but I feel like the decision to move away from the awesome Sci fi mystery vibe of the earlier seasons and focus mainly on the politics of the universe was a bad idea. It felt like it started to drift into generic Sci fi territory towards the end and completely moved away from what made the show so compelling in the first place.

Don't get me wrong, I think the politics of that universe was interesting, but I feel like it all worked better when it helped drive the grander Sci fi mystery going on."
Office Girls,Breaking bad and Dexter were shitty shows.
Office Girls,"Abbott Elementary is unfunny.

I tried 6 episodes of it, chuckled a couple of times, but it just was not funny.


The worst character was the principal and the second worst was the lead - she was grating."
Office Girls,Andor is just okay
Office Girls,I think White Lotus should have been called White People Problems.
Office Girls,Supernatural is a bad ripoff of Buffy.
Office Girls,Scrubs is overrated tripe.
Office Girls,Friends is not funny
Office Girls,Did not like House of the Dragon and find it quite overrated tbh
Office Girls,HBO Watchmen was horrible
Office Girls,"Rings of Power was fine. Not as good as the films but still good. 

Modern Trek is great. Mostly. But it also has no interest in being like old Trek. (With the exception of SNW, but even then it’s still feels new.)"
Office Girls,"Mr Robot was written by hacks who knew how to barter with clickbait journalists that agreed to pretend like their incoherent, disjointed writing was an artistic choice rather than take the time to make a halfway decent show. We were duped into thinking the show is genius when it was really just the lazy afterbirth of better shows during a short period when the market demanded “gritty” television."
Office Girls,I couldn’t get into Fleabag
Office Girls,She Hulk was good. Most marvel d+ series are good.
Office Girls,Calling Andor mediocre and derivative of better stories. Its as original as the plot of Avatar.
Office Girls,The Sopranos is overrated.
Office Girls,Seinfeld is a horrible show.
Office Girls,"I think Star Trek Discovery (post season 3) is fine, and often good. That doesnt extend to Picard though, that show has no idea what it's doing. 

(perhaps more controversial) while I love Strange New Worlds, I think its more guilty of the ""its the thing you know"" criticisim that gets lobbed at Lower Decks occasionally. No matter how often Lower Decks relies on gags about the past, it's season finale is always looking inward and focusing on the characters, and I dont think it would ever devote it's season finale to just recreating a TOS episode with its own cast. 

I feel like you can enjoy She Hulk without being a paid shill (and the ending didnt nearly disappoint me as much as the ending for Wandavision)"
Office Girls,"Seinfeld is not funny. Its characters are all insufferable, repulsive, irritating jerks."
Office Girls,"I've been an enthusiastic reader of fantasy for decades, which is why I enjoyed the fuck out of the Witcher but found little to love in Game of Thrones, as far as TV goes."
Office Girls,Weekly shows aren't worth the adoration and devotion they get.
Office Girls,"So many shows have twists just to have twists... I even heard writers look at what fans say online so they can just do the opposite of what people think to throw in twists.. which ends up ruining stories that could otherwise be good, even if people can predict stuff..

And so many shows have plot points/plot holes that never get tied up and I think it's just for the sake to keep viewers so the show will make money from ads when people keep watching.."
Office Girls,Game of thrones was boring
Office Girls,Dark had a disappointing 2nd half for its repetitiveness despite the good ending concept.  Its 1st half is awesome and dripping with style
Office Girls,"Overall, D&D did an astonishingly good job on the adaptation of GoT. Things went a bit wonky when they ran out of stuff to adapt, but they never signed up to write original content."
Office Girls,S1 of True detective is good but overrated
Office Girls,I loved all of Westworld and I didn’t have any trouble following the plot.
Edge of the Universe,"Kevin Smith's worked with her before and seems to be a big fan, so that makes sense."
Edge of the Universe,Why isn't SMG continuing in the role?
Edge of the Universe,I totally thought that the show was over lol
Edge of the Universe,"Honestly, I know it got a lot of complaints due to He-Man not being in most of it through the first half...but it was a pretty well-done series.

It held true to the spirit of the 80s show but wasn't, y'know, Filmation crap just made to sell toys. 

I'm happy there's going to be a second season."
Edge of the Universe,"Just keep it inside

Learn how to hide

Your feelings"
Edge of the Universe,"I know I'm in the minority, but I'm really looking forward to the new Skeletor story arc after his final scene in the previous season. Seems creepy/badass."
Edge of the Universe,Jewel of Wilson’s foul domain
Edge of the Universe,"Give me some quality live-action He-Man already, damn!"
Edge of the Universe,"Skimmimg through the article, I thought for a second that William Shatner was doing the voice for Skeletor, imagine that."
Edge of the Universe,"Seeing as she’s literally married to He-Man, I’m not surprised."
Edge of the Universe,Didn’t fans hate the last one of these shows that they made?
Edge of the Universe,This show is still on?
Edge of the Universe,"Amped they're continuing this! I thought the S2 finale could have been much better paced, but overall I really enjoyed this."
Edge of the Universe,I really enjoyed the first season so I'm happy they are making more. Don't really have an opinion on the voice acting change.
Edge of the Universe,"I'm going to get downvoted to hell but dear god I loathed both seasons of this show.  And Teelah was the most god awful protagonist.  She had to be coerced and pulled from one scene to the next, was joyless and just uninteresting to watch.  And that's not SMG's fault, the writing was just bad.  

To the show's credit I was interested in Evil Lynn and Orco's episode.  The animation was top notch.  

But He-Man got sidelined even Skeletor got sidelined.  And for the most part the show was a joyless slog that damaged one of my childhood heroes.  But this show wasn't for me as an 80's kid.  It sold itself as being for me, but it was a complete bait and switch."
Edge of the Universe,Super
Edge of the Universe,"Definitely an upgrade. Though I don’t think her husband had a great He-Man voice. A good Adam but he lacked that booming bass from the 80s show.

Edit: Melissa Benoist as Wolverine’s daughter:

Edge of the Universe,She was super girl right?
Edge of the Universe,Didn’t they already ruin this franchise?
Edge of the Universe,"Is this a new, new series or a continuation?"
Edge of the Universe,I'm honestly surprised this show is getting another season. The first was a monster turd.
Edge of the Universe,Awe that sucks! I thought she did a great job! I hope it's just a scheduling conflict
Edge of the Universe,How has this not been cancelled yet?
Edge of the Universe,"My take is it just needs to be a “He-Man” show… like the original was… 

And then, at least, all us OG He-Man fans would love it. Because we loved that show. 

You can always make a different show, centered around a different character, and still call it “He-Man.” You can do that, it’s a free country, but then you risk alienating the people that liked and enjoyed the original show. 

Maybe you can have greater success without the original fans… that’s possible… but it’s not the direction I would have gone with the IP."
Edge of the Universe,"The actual star of He-Man, Teela is getting an new actor? 

Somehow, some way, we shall be okay."
Edge of the Universe,"This is such a lowkey powerhouse piece of IP. New toy line, two animated series and a live action show all in the last ~5 years."
Edge of the Universe,…..and it’s cancelled
Edge of the Universe,Idek what another season would be about. Teela is the most powerful being in history and STILL has He-Man for backup
Edge of the Universe,this dumpster fire gets a season 2? and yet netflix cancels good shows? what kind of power does kevin smith hold over netflix?
Edge of the Universe,Okay but like... give that the first part was awful why even bother.
Edge of the Universe,Why won’t Sarah Michelle Gellar reprise the role? I really love anything that she’s involved in.
Edge of the Universe,I like Melissa and I like the symmetry ofThe Vampire Slayer being replaced by Supergirl
Edge of the Universe,"Netflix cancels shows people give a shit about, but greenlights one of the most derided misfires of the last decade? Oof. If even SMG didn't want anything to do with it you know this shit is even more DOA than the first series."
Edge of the Universe,Good. She was miscast.
Edge of the Universe,"Bruh, Masters Of The Universe series does Netflix have?"
Edge of the Universe,"I don’t think SMG was good in the role, but I also don’t think the show was very good period."
Edge of the Universe,Would anyone even care?
Edge of the Universe,"Please don’t destroy my childhood, I can’t go through another Footloose situation"
Edge of the Universe,I wouldn’t touch that project with a 50 ft pole either.
Edge of the Universe,This show was utter garbage
Edge of the Universe,Netflix canceled so much. Why are they making this trash?
Edge of the Universe,"That is going to continue?
Bold move from Netflix."
Edge of the Universe,Boooo
Edge of the Universe,Are we doing another He-Man-less He-Man cartoon again?
Edge of the Universe,Why not the show as a multiverse then you can have both women as the character?
Edge of the Universe,I always wonder if those actors whom rejects roles still filthy rich or what got on their minds to pass important roles.
Edge of the Universe,"That show, it's fans & haters. Lol"
Edge of the Universe,"I thought that the season was told out of order. They second half of the season should have been shown first, with minor tweaks to have it flow better, and the second half be second. It'll give us fans some time with the characters before killing them off. Then kill them off in the fifth episode for some shocks value and then continue with how the episodes in the first half but now the second half. It works out wonderfully and the series might have actually been better."
Edge of the Universe,"I hated this show and say that with full confidence after watching too many episodes of it. I'm utterly shocked it's getting another season or that Netflix will waste money on it versus other shows like Mindhunters, etc."
Edge of the Universe,… and hosting me too like some brain-dead AOL-er
Edge of the Universe,Whatever her projects and films I'm always support her.  She's the greatest super girl.
Edge of the Universe,Had no idea this was in the works
Edge of the Universe,"Plus the voice actor for He-Man is her husband, they met while working together on Supergirl."
Edge of the Universe,"They are friends, and he likes giving his friends work."
Edge of the Universe,"She doesn’t like to work. 

I don’t mean that in a disparaging way. 

She comes and goes as she pleases within show business, choosing carefully when she works and when she doesn’t so that she can take care of her family. With her already producing and starring in a show, she likely just doesn’t want to work on a second one at the same time."
Edge of the Universe,They did not say.
Edge of the Universe,I’m assuming she will be busy filming season 2 of her new Paramount+ show.
Edge of the Universe,Maybe she watched the first series
Edge of the Universe,"if it isn't scheduling conflict or her being too buzy , maybe it's because of the reaction to her character in season 1 as she was mostly the lead instead of He-man and grown men took that personally."
Edge of the Universe,You didn't catch the final episode's teaser?
Edge of the Universe,"I'm kinda surprised it was renewed.  I have no strong feelings about it (watched the first episode and a half, decided it wasn't for me), but it was an odd choice to try to harness the nostalgia of He-Man fans, and then write He-Man and Skeletor out of the show in the first episode, lol.

People tried to pretend online that the backlash was just about sexism, but like Ghostbusters 2016, the backlash is probably just because you made something that sucks."
Edge of the Universe,"Genuinely, compared to Transformers War For Cybertron it was a fucking masterpiece."
Edge of the Universe,AND HE PRAYS!
Edge of the Universe,I just wanna link [this legendary cover](https://youtube.com/watch?v=C7Q10bfWEMQ&si=EnSIkaIECMiOmarE)
Edge of the Universe,A lullaby the breezes whisper..
Edge of the Universe,"I didn't hate having Teela be the fous but I DID hate turning Skeletor into Joker and giving him the same exact abusive relationship with Evil Lynn.

We get it Kevin, you love batman and Mark Hamill but come up with something original."
Edge of the Universe,I think it was over hated and I loved some aspects of it.  I do kinda question the direction it took though.  Who takes a show called HE-MAN and decides to make it mostly about the female side character?  Its odd.  Like a Barbie reboot that focused entirely on Ken.  But it was still overall enjoyable.
Edge of the Universe,I didn't watxh the original  but the show was 80% good but the 20% that was bad really slowed down the show. Like you would have this great story then we would stop and focus on 1 issue or character and pause everything else. Made the show clunky. I am sure there is a version with a little editing it would be really good.
Edge of the Universe,I loved it.
Edge of the Universe,"No, just noisy Internet people."
Edge of the Universe,Yes we did
Edge of the Universe,"They wanted to flesh out the side characters so they took away He-man and Skeletor for the first half of the season and ""killed"" them off. Anyone with a half a brain knew they were coming back but half brains complained about wokeness because Teela was the main character. He-man and Skeletor come back in the second half of the season. The whole thing was done really well. Outside of the Fisto jokes that were cringey and get old quick I enjoyed it."
Edge of the Universe,They watched it and talked about it. It doesn't matter if they liked it or not.
Edge of the Universe,Hard to say. A certain portion of the internet definitely complained the loudest (many after not watching it or only watching the first episode or two) but if it got picked up apparently Netflix was happy with the numbers. So not sure it wasn't more noise than anything.
Edge of the Universe,"It's nice to see people can finally dislike the show on this sub without being downvoted to oblivion and called sexist. I'm glad people have chilled out a bit.

I had a more mixed reaction to the show. Teela was a real drag and although Evil Lyn started off great, her character and arc fell apart after she supplanted Skeletor as the main villain. The side characters (including Adam which is weird to say about a He-Man show) were handled well though, so I think the show has some untapped potential if Smith forgets about the culture war and just writes a good show. I am cautiously optimistic about a second (or third? Who even knows with Netflix's release strategy) season."
Edge of the Universe,"> nd for the most part the show was a joyless slog that damaged one of my childhood heroes. 

Watching old He-Man cartoons as an adult damaged the show/character for me."
Edge of the Universe,The show is utter trash. Just awful.
Edge of the Universe,"No one without a paper thin agenda is going to drag you over shitting on a Kevin Smith production

Although, i’ll give credit where it’s due, the Clerks cartoon was pretty good and probably the last decent thing he worked on."
Edge of the Universe,Not sure if I totally agree with it being an upgrade.
Edge of the Universe,Yup
Edge of the Universe,sounds like a continuation
Edge of the Universe,Was also hoping it would start fresh. But no.
Edge of the Universe,Maybe her role in Wolf Pack?
Edge of the Universe,The new He-Man show was mostly derided by a few weirdos on YouTube and their fans who didn't watch it; it's great.
Edge of the Universe,"Huge fan other both MotU and SMG and I have to agree. Not the only one in that series either. I loved how much it celebrated the original toys and show but somehow it all came together as a meh show. Still glad we’re getting more, though."
Edge of the Universe,The Tron one hasn’t been renewed yet.
Edge of the Universe,How so? It was extremely successful for them.
Edge of the Universe,See if it works out for 'em
Edge of the Universe,They love losing money
Edge of the Universe,Read the show title again...
Edge of the Universe,"You do know that they quickly brought him back to life, right?  Like who didn't see that coming.  And it was actually cool seeing the other characters try to get by without relying on He-Man for awhile."
Edge of the Universe,"He-Man was literally in the majority of the episodes lmfao

He was only absent from like two or three of them"
Edge of the Universe,Forgot that Adam was voiced by Mon-El. Clearly Smith loved Supergirl.
Edge of the Universe,"One could even say they’ve collaborated on multiple things.

Edit: I see you edited your comment to reflect their marriage."
Edge of the Universe,I wanted them together in the show badly. Then I found out they’re married IRL and somehow my universe felt complete haha
Edge of the Universe,Who doesn’t?
Edge of the Universe,"Good for her. If I was successful enough to pick and choose what I worked on, I'd absolutely do stuff like this or being in awful movies for a free vacation. I'm never going to get mad at an actor for prioritizing a good time over their career.   
EXCEPT FOR YOU, TAYLOR LAUTNER! You thought you were too good to be Shark Boy again, but we all know where you came from, you coward!"
Edge of the Universe,"No one likes to work.

I also don't mean that in a disparaging way."
Edge of the Universe,"I have so much respect for that, and the way that somehow she and Freddy Prinze Jr have been able to keep their private lives mostly private.  Seems like one reason they are a successful couple. 

Married 20 years and they both look amazing and seem to have the right idea about work in general."
Edge of the Universe,"Oh thank God.

I thought she had done/said something horrible. 

This was a much more benign explanation."
Home,I've spent too much time reading comments in this thread . What is my life?
Home,"I bet he made that ""aurgh aurgh aurgh"" noise while doing it, too."
Home,"Anderson:

>”On the first day of filming, I walked out of my dressing room, and Tim was in the hallway in his robe. He opened his robe and flashed me quickly — completely naked underneath. He said it was only fair, because he had seen me naked. Now we’re even. I laughed uncomfortably”"
Home,Between this and the show about her sex tape I’m starting to think that her life hasn’t really been that great.
Home,"There’s an episode in an early season where Tim goes to a Scottish festival with Al and is wearing a kilt. In one of the outtakes, he flashes Jill and the way Patricia Richardson reacted, I always thought he was commando"

Well, not that shocked."

Home,What an odd thing to randomly bring up 32 years after it happened.
Home,She's also trying to sell a book and Tim Allen denied it. So I would recommend staying neutral at the moment.
Home,If this didn't happen how does someone defend themselves against this type of allegation? Do you just say I didn't do it and take whatever comes or what?
Home,"So we are all just judging him guilty, based on ONE account, from 1991? That has never been uttered before now? I call bullshit."
Home,What are we supposed to do with this information?
Home,She's walked into rooms totally naked during work events. Without it being a known thing.

I assume nobody really cares now either,its just we are gigantic enough idiots to consider it fashionable to pretend shocked over stuff like this. Has Pamela never flashed her tits in public?

Home,"now half a century later, emotional damage"
Home,"Initial thoughts, Okay what is Pamela Anderson selling... no one in Hollywood just brings up a ""traumatic experience"" where a co-star flashed them 30+ years ago. (At least not without some agenda in play) 

>“Love, Pamela” is one of the most anticipated titles of the year from HarperCollins. In it, Anderson addresses last year’s hit Hulu series Pam and Tommy.

Fucking called it...

Story that probably didn't happen (or at least didn't happen the way she's selling it) to bring attention to a new show."
Home,"He flashed her and why after all these years she wants attention for it?

She literally has porn on the internet but she's looking for attention for being flashed 30 years ago... 

Sounds like she's looking for cancel culture to make her relevant again."
Home,Crazy how everyone will turn on someone because of a verbal allegation. I’m not saying this couldn’t of happened but it seems insane to me that people will take things as absolute fact just because someone said it happened. Especially coming from someone who used to flash her tits on the regular. How many times did people see her expose herself when they didn’t ask for it?
Home,Taking Tool Time to another level. Am I right?
Home,I remember Andy Dick honking her big fat jugs like a sex crazed maniac in front of everybody at her roast.
Home,"Well thats pretty fucked but like, what does her being 23 have to do with anything? Is that just to reinforce that she was an adult?"
Home,Who cares. Can you imagine how many women have flashed their tits for work in that industry. If tits/vag/ass were as offensive as cock we'd need a separate Twitter for the complaints.

Home,"I mean, it WAS Tool Time."
Home,She must be strapped for cash and relevancy.
Home,And she probably acted kinky and flirty.. I’m sick of this. Downvote me all you want but she made a career doing this sh*t…. She fell in love how many times? She’s a ho.

Last Chance U,"It is a funny series. It is best when it is show casing ~~semi~~ horrible coaches and poor kids just trying to be successful, but have not realized that the success isn't happening with football.

Last season was a total departure in that the coaches were actually great people and the kids for the most part realized that education was the key.

I wonder which way this will go and how it will work going from 120+ potential main characters to around 25."
Last Chance U,"I’m excited for this. I’m not a fan of football so I never got into the show before (yes, I know you don’t have to be a fan of football to enjoy the show) but I’m a huge basketball fan so I’ll tune in for sure"
Last Chance U,I will say that editing can make an abrasive coach seem like a bad guy
Last Chance U,That guy from the last season who had two kids definitely didn't recognize the value of education. He was dumb as a stump
Last Chance U,I agree but it wasn't editing for the first four seasons.
Last Chance U,I felt bad for his wife.
Last Chance U,HEHE..yeah
Last Chance U,"eh, Buddy wasn't as bad as people make him out to be."
Last Chance U,That part where he tried to give a speech about her was so uncomfortable. He literally talks like a dumb 12 year old.
Last Chance U,Dang gum it!
Last Chance U,[deleted]
Last Chance U,July 28
Last Chance U,"I watched the first... 2 seasons or so?  They were pretty good, but then I pretty much stopped.  How has the recent seasons been?  Worth catching up or nah?"
Last Chance U,Every time Last Chance U is mentioned my first reaction is to look up what Ms. Wagner is doing these days. Very impressive character.
Last Chance U,Agree. Zero interest in a basketball version.
Last Chance U,"I'm excited to see what they do with a Basketball season (I also just actually prefer Basketball as a sport), but I am sad they won't do two years at this school. This season looks great. Now the series will be all unsymmetrical."
Last Chance U,Considering what happened at Independence I wouldn't be surprised if they were struggling to find places that want to take on the drama of everything.
Last Chance U,"> WHY are they switching from football to basketball

I wish they'd have stuck with football too, but I doubt a football season is happening this year anyway. And the NJCAA already pushed the season to spring, so a lot of the kids trying to get grades to go back to FBS football won't be playing anyway. I hope they go back to football after the next season though."
Last Chance U,"I wish it was being released before basketball, baseball, and the other sports started back up"
Last Chance U,They're pretty meh and the drama is nothing compared to the first 2 seasons.
Last Chance U,"I liked 3-4 better, for the sole reason that the head coach is an absolute nut job who curses at everything and fights with everyone. He is a white guy who grew up in Compton, so he thinks he is black."
Last Chance U,They made the decision to move away from football before COVID.
Last Chance U,That's the last session afaik
Last Chance U,"That's a shame.  If I recall correctly, the lady councillor in the first 2 seasons was such a genuinely good person who was looking out for those kids that it really hooked me into the series."
Last Chance U,Iirc she left the school after that and snowballed her fame from the show to bigger and better things.
Last Chance U,"Hmmm, yeah actually that's probably one of the main reasons I ended up stopping.  I think they had a big overhaul for the 3rd season, and I wasn't really down for that."
Last Chance U,Not surprised this shift seems to have maintained its quality.  The Last Chance U people know what they're doing.  Cheer might have been even better (although it's aged poorly)
Last Chance U,"The basic problem with Cheer is that no matter how hard the show tries, it isn't going to make me care about a bunch of kids at a community college trying to win a Cheer leader competition."
Last Chance U,"What's great about Cheer is realizing that competitive cheer is as physically grueling as anything and these people are elite athletes.  But unlike football and basketball, there is nothing beyond the college level, so they're at the peak of their sport right now and this is their opportunity to make the best of it."
Last Chance U,Agreed that's what sucked me in
Last Chance U,"I'm working on the basketball season, and it's turning out really interesting. A great cast of characters."
Last Chance U,"It’s a great documentary series whether you like American football or not (it actually helped me get into watching it more from the UK).

I’m only 3 eps into the new series but I’m loving the change of setting in a more urban environment rather than some random rural campus and having a coach that isn’t an angry wanker the whole time is so refreshing."
Last Chance U,"I swear I always end up rooting for these kids on this show and follow their careers as they move on.  Two in Ronald Ollie and Dakota Allen from EMCC even were part of my Raiders for a short while.  Rakeem Boyd from Indy is now at Arkansas and has a very good chance of being the first drafted Last Chance U kid and probably fairly high.

S5 man I really feel for Dior and RJ.  I relate to their father issues so I hit.  Nu'u also man I just want this kid to succeed.  Such great stories this season albeit the players are definitely not of the caliber of past ones. 

I would also say Last Chance has one of the best opening intros around.  All 5 seasons the band/drum sets are awesome!

Really disappointed they are done with football.   I dont have interest in basketball at all."
Last Chance U,Y’all should check out cheer if you haven’t already. It’s phenomenal.
Last Chance U,"Damn, I'm sad to hear they're moving on from football. I think football is much more visually interesting than basketball and the visuals are what make this show in my opinion. I'm sure it'll still be great."
Last Chance U,"I love the football stuff, I think it a great show to watch these guy try and make it.  The pressure they put on themselves and the choices they make.  

I have watched one episode of the new season, I want things to go so well for the O lineman with the kids."
Last Chance U,Thanks.  I’ll add this to my watch list.
Last Chance U,Watched and really enjoyed season 1 but the second lost me. Maybe I'll jump to season 3 and go from there.
Last Chance U,"I am loving this season so far. Unlike past seasons the coaching staff doesn't seem like a pack of sleaze balls. Also the players aren't the typical collection of over indulged coddled assholes.

I am bummed this is the last season of the show. It is a nice off season treat leading into the new season.

Last Chance U and QB1 are my off season football fix."
Last Chance U,What do you do? Last Chance U has been a huge inspiration for me. Super excited for the basketball season.
Last Chance U,"> Ronald Ollie EMCC even were part of my Raiders for a short while.

LMAO.. That lazy fool lasted about 20 minutes."
Last Chance U,Dakota was drafted as well. I am rooting for him to catch on somewhere.
Last Chance U,"It is ok..

So much of Cheer was manufactured and over all the whole ""sport"" is just silly."
Last Chance U,"The third has a total scumbag for the head coach. He gets shitcanned after the fourth ended.

The second is SSDD of S1 and S4 is SSDD of S3.

The fifth is a whole different coach and school and it is great."
Last Chance U,">coaching staff doesn’t seem like a pack of sleaze balls.

I love that the positional coaches get absolutely hammered weekly lol. Beam seems like a great guy and coach too."
Last Chance U,I'm an assistant editor.
Last Chance U,That’s right. My bad. Believe he’s in JAX now.
Last Chance U,[deleted]
Last Chance U,"I'm cautious to give away any information like that that isn't already out, because I have very good job security right now."
Last Chance U,[deleted]
Last Chance U,"I mean, I am proud that I'm working on it. And I can mention some broad stuff, but I'm not gonna violate my NDA."
Last Chance U,"It really was, that ending of the second to last episode (I believe Ep 5) was fuckin insane"
Last Chance U,"Let me tell you why I loved this show. OP you mentioned it. The story telling was honest. Not everyone's story ends up with the happy ending. They dont gloss over the fact that they are all bad students and football is all they have. Its like Hard knocks hard core addition. 

And not to mention the aid that kept them all on track scholastically was hot AF.   "
Last Chance U,"Cinematography was unreal as well. The framing of the one on one interviews was always on point, and the game play also looked really good which sometimes isn't great on these sports documentariea."
Last Chance U,I'm so in love with the Academic Advisor. Her rapport with each and every one of the athletes was exemplary and made my already attraction to her stronger. 
Last Chance U,Yeah I loved it as well. Reminded me of Friday Night Lights (tv series).
Last Chance U,The episode focusing on Ronald Ollie was one of the most heartbreaking things I've ever seen. Especially the melancholic end...
Last Chance U,"That show is wicked...I hope they have future episodes. That AA has the toughest job ever considering most of those kids showed no motivation at all.
"
Last Chance U,"I play football at a small college, not juco, and it's funny to me how similar the players are just about everywhere you go.  Even at Alabama or Notre Dame, the players are still the same, immature young kids having fun.  "
Last Chance U,Would you recommend this to someone who doesn't care for sports? 
Last Chance U,"If you liked this show, you'd like ""All or Nothing"" series on Amazon. It's free to watch even if you don't have prime. They followed the AZ Cardinals for the entire 2015 season. It was extremely well done. Probably the best sports doc I've ever seen. So much behind the scenes and getting to know a bunch of players. Can't recommend it enough."
Last Chance U,[deleted]
Last Chance U,"I started watching this show today per your recommendation and I'm hooked! I found myself cheering during the games. I fell in love with all the staff especially ""Ms Wa-nah"". As a mom of college aged kids, I could really relate to the mentality of the players. Production on this was amazing! I'm going to recommend this everyone I know. "
Last Chance U,One of the best documentaries I've seen. I was hooked from the start. I think I watched it all in one weekend. 
Last Chance U,It grabbed your heart and your mind every single minute!
Last Chance U,"I recommend anyone that enjoyed this to watch the Oscar winning documentary ""Undefeated"" on Netflix too. I loved the show, but the whole premise seemed like a tv version of that 2011 documentary. "
Last Chance U,Just finally binged through all of this on a sick day. I live just a few minutes from Scooba so it's pretty surreal to see the documentary's take on something that is just everyday life around here. They really did an outstanding job!
Last Chance U,YES! Definitely my favorite show on Netflix (I know that's an unpopular opinion but that's just how much I love this show)
Last Chance U,They did a great job with it. Really gave a good idea of what junior college is like for athletes that are taking the hard road to try and go pro or jut get off the streets. I hope they do another season. 
Last Chance U,"I made the dumbest choice. 

I didn't know anything about the show. I accidentally watched the last episode of the season. Episode 6 I think. 

I thought it was great, and then realized oh, that was the last episode. 

Is it even worth watching the first 5 episodes now? lol, this is by far the dumbest thing i've done while watching tv shows. 

"
Last Chance U,Still available on netflix?
Last Chance U,Let's hear your opinion on the head coach.
Last Chance U,I couldn't get into it. Turned it off sometime in the second episode.
Last Chance U,No link?
Last Chance U,If i played football i could have passed all my courses without going to class.
Last Chance U,I'm not gonna lie. I would have run up the score and tried my best to embarrass that team if they'd taken out one of my trainers. Not even counting for how dirty delta played.
Last Chance U,"""And not to mention the aid that kept them all on track scholastically was hot AF"" yes she is...Sweet baby Jesus, I'd be crushing hard on her if she was my AA"
Last Chance U,Judging a star quarterback for getting some was kinda cringy though. He handled that talk perfectly. 
Last Chance U,"She was incredible, seeing someone that ivested in helping these lost kids succeed was truly inspiring. After a couple episodes I started to realize that she was really the heart of the documentary, not the coach, which is what I assumed going into it."
Last Chance U,"She was lovely. What a frustrating job though. 

It's amazing how much suspense the show managed to extract from whether player Soandso manages to find his way into class,  pencil in hand or not, or doesn't he and ruins his whole career."
Last Chance U,Why must there always be (at least) one creepy as fuck comment comment?
Last Chance U,The academic advisor was basically Tammy Taylor. 
Last Chance U,"Yeah one of my friends said the same thing, I'll have to check that series out one of these days. "
Last Chance U,"Team name lions, colors red and black..plus the attitudes of some of the players were the same as early attitudes in the lions of east Dillion. I agree very much with this statement! "
Last Chance U,"It is mostly centered around football at this small school, but it does a good job giving you insight into the central figures lives to make you start caring about them. I am a football fan though so I definitely enjoyed the game scenes as much as anything else. "
Last Chance U,"yes, ''All or nothing'' is great too, if you have HBO hard knocks is similar, but just as good"
Last Chance U,[deleted]
Last Chance U,"Yeah, go for it. Plenty of interesting things happen along the way."
Last Chance U,It's a Netflix original so it'll probably always be available or at least for a long time.
Last Chance U,Perfect example of do what I say not do what I do. He yells at his team for losing their cool while losing his own cool. He is confrontational with each and every teammember. He doubts their injuries and is basically held up by the rest of his staff. 
Last Chance U,So how was UNC? 
Last Chance U,"Welp, I was on the fence about this show but now I gotta watch it.... 

(Edit: 20 minutes in and I was like ""wtf are these guys talking about"" until she showed up in that blue dress. Wow, just wow....) "
Last Chance U,"They're in the south, I assume she's Christian so that would be a factor. Plus there's still the whole 'southern gentleman' thing."
Last Chance U,It was for sure awkward but i have a feeling she has seen plenty of players with Kids and knows how big of a mistake that can be. 
Last Chance U,She's a Southern Belle and probably likes things closer to traditional
Last Chance U,and she was Hot AF ( as I mentioned in my reply but thought I should say it again) 
Last Chance U,Wasn't that her job though?
Last Chance U,Are saying mine is creepy? For saying she's attractive and a good person? Lol? 
Last Chance U,Yeah she's definitely Tammy Taylor hahaha. Every voice sounded like Kyle Chandler (Eric Taylor) as well. Shows how good he does the accent.
Last Chance U,Solid show so very worth the watch.
Fist of the North Star,"crank up the volume, feel an inferior man and let the testosterone flow like a river"
Fist of the North Star,"Ah, shit, not them too! If they kill off Pike's show because of cost cuts, I ***swear to GOD...***"
Fist of the North Star,"""Why don't you just give us money and we do nothing?"" - Streaming service providers"
Fist of the North Star,"I have enjoyed Lower Decks so far, I hope it stays."
Fist of the North Star,Give me 6+ seasons of Strange New Worlds and Lower Decks and I’ll be happy.
Fist of the North Star,"LOL, what a ridiculous headline considering what the platform is, and how the studio who owns the platform has prioritized the property. 

Then again, this is essentially just a FanSite (as well read as it might be, there aren't any actual journalists on staff, they're all amateur writers working in the Geek Culture milieu) so for what its worth, the entire thrust of the article is based on this one bit of ""news"" such as it is: 

> none of the other Trek shows have been officially given new seasons, meaning there is no announced production for the continuing series or any new ones.

**This is literally it.** Everything else is speculation/worry that because there's no *announced* production for continuing series, that the future remains unclear in the face of streaming cuts, despite the fact that Star Trek is floating that platform, will always float that platform, and the idea that streaming cuts means the future of the TV series is in question is alarmist and frankly, ridiculous.

If anything, the worst-case scenario is that they crank back the budget on the shows, not that they eradicate them completely. Star Trek is successful TV. Exceedingly so. They're basically giving up on it being a film franchise for the foreseeable future and it's a good bet that's *been* paying off. 

TL:DR - the future of Star Trek TV is fine, Paramount+ is going to continue funding production of Star Trek shows, and this is a Geek Culture fansite stretching its legs pursuing a complete hypothetical based on a single line of real news."
Fist of the North Star,Please keep lower decks - it’s legitimately the best Star Trek show since voyager
Fist of the North Star,Streaming services will not survive if they have no good exclusives shows. Star Trek is one of the biggest IPs owned by Paramount. They would be dumb to cancel Star Trek shows.
Fist of the North Star,"Keep SNW at the very least.

I see this this as a relatively good thing. Having like 6 series on at once seems a little much. Strengthen your focus."
Fist of the North Star,I enjoy having a full spread of star trek to watch this year please leave it alone. Lower decks is awesome.
Fist of the North Star,"I’m not a huge Star Trek fan but I had a great time watching Strange New Worlds. Reminded me of when I watched Stargate as a kid with the case of the week episodes.

Made me realise how much I miss that format."
Fist of the North Star,Any of us who lived through the video game crash of 1983 could see this coming.
Fist of the North Star,Only 2 things will survive a nuclear bomb; cockroaches and Alex Kurtzman's Star Trek.
Fist of the North Star,"Given that Star Trek is propping up a lot of other stuff at Paramount, I think we're good."
Fist of the North Star,Right when they started making good shows.
Fist of the North Star,"Good bye, *Star Trek Discovery*.  And whatever Section 31 show that was in development Hell.    


*Prodigy, Lower Decks, Strange New Worlds* and some form of *Picard* (TNG) spin-off will be Trek's future, imo."
Fist of the North Star,"With Picard ending this year and Discovery likely ending in the next couple of years, I think the immediate danger to Star Trek on Paramount Plus is gone.

Star Trek has proven to be an important pillar to their streaming service, and you can't just have nothing but Yellowstone spin-offs.

I do think the era of Star Trek shows with a large season long arc is likely ending with Picard and Discovery.

There's a rumor that they are planning a spin-off Star Trek series that focuses on Worf and Raffi doing missions for Starfleet Intelligence.

This could be a great way to keep new a Star Trek show going without the need for a large ensemble cast or huge budget for massive space battles and other special effects.

It also slots in nicely since Strange New Worlds, Lower Decks, and Prodigy likely have several more seasons of life left."
Fist of the North Star,"Lower Decks is by far, the best ST show in a long time and I am in love with Strange New Worlds. I will pay to keep Paramount+ as long as these shows continue.

Otherwise; cancelled!"
Fist of the North Star,"Cut Discovery, problem solved"
Fist of the North Star,"Picard has to go. Stewart is either too old now, or he's decided to play the part as someone who is unable to move, or speak without slurring like he's had 5 bottles of regular earth brandy. And a 25 year old's hairstyle does not make Seven or Crusher 25 again."
Fist of the North Star,"Simple, keep prodigy and lower decks on tv. Strange new worlds could honestly jump to movies (maybe after a 3rd season kinda like OG trek)"
Fist of the North Star,Imagine if we don't get a season 3 of SNW because they're only gonna budget for S6 of Star Trek Therapy.
Fist of the North Star,Keep Lower Decks and Prodigy please
Fist of the North Star,[Let them die!](https://youtu.be/4yIRfXiLQbE?t=291)
Fist of the North Star,So all the streaming services are cutting back on offerings to save money because they don’t make enough on subscriptions alone. And because of that people will start to subscribe less and less lol.
Fist of the North Star,"The only reason that anyone pays for paramount.

Edit: misspelling"
Fist of the North Star,"It’s simple really, just like all the others, they need subscribers to justify spending."
Fist of the North Star,"This is the last season of Picard anyway. Just keep lower decks and strange new worlds and don't worry about the section 31 show. If they want to tell more stories, they can start doing three episode miniseries."
Fist of the North Star,All this push for streaming and subs is starting to back fire
Fist of the North Star,"So no Section 31 spin off, right?"
Fist of the North Star,"Paramount has the possibility of keeping marginal Star Trek fans forever but only if there is always a live action show coming within a year and not just a cartoon.  I enjoyed Prodigy a lot but Lower Decks just seems like ""new 'member berries"" of old material."
Fist of the North Star,"A new show with Jeri Ryan as captain would be pretty awesome, especially with some TNG/DS9/VOY cameos thrown in from time to time."
Fist of the North Star,"In related news, my ongoing subscription to Paramount+ also remains unclear."
Fist of the North Star,I’m more worried about the future of Evil with this announcement. Such a glorious show. Star Trek Strange New Worlds should be safe.
Fist of the North Star,So Paramount+ is a very confusing streaming service in it makes no sense. They've got so much old content people would kill to see.
Fist of the North Star,Star Trek is literally the only reason I subscribe to Paramount+
Fist of the North Star,Lower Decks and Strange New Worlds are two of my favorite shows on TV right now.
Fist of the North Star,I'll be happy if they keep Lower Decks. The rest is meh aside from Discovery which is crap.
Fist of the North Star,I don’t understand how they can make crap like Discovery and then a great show like Strange New Worlds.  It’s a complete disconnect.
Fist of the North Star,Kill off the bad new-Treks (Picard and Discovery) and just keep the good ones aka Lower Decks and Strange New Worlds. By the way im still waiting on DS9 and Voyager blurays. Id rather have those than anything else
Fist of the North Star,"Picard is wrapping up, cancel Discovery, that should give them some budget for Strange New Worlds."
Fist of the North Star,As someone who grew up watching TNG and loving the show to this day I’m starting to think it’s fine if some franchises just die.
Fist of the North Star,It's time to put Discovery down. After second season is basically unwatchable.
Fist of the North Star,good. Currently rewatching DS9 and the difference is just abyssal
Fist of the North Star,The only one I'd actually miss is the kids show Prodigy. They finally nailed the spirit of Star Trek with that one. They tried with SNW but it's so bland. LD is hit and miss with its latest season being a huge miss. Discovery and Picard are epic fails. A lot of Star Trek content from this streaming service but not a lot of quality stuff after so many years.
Fist of the North Star,"Keep Strange New Worlds, Lower Decks and Prodigy. Cut Discovery loose. Develop new series that expand the story after Voyager/Picard Season 3 for whenever they decide to end Strange New Worlds."
Fist of the North Star,"I don't know if this is an unpopular opinion, but I really couldn't get into Trek post-Abrams. I grew up in the 80s and 90s on the Original Series and the Next Generation. I watched the Abrams reboot and the two subsequent movies but I felt that they ignored most of the things that made Trek what it was in favor of something different. When the series started streaming (Discovery, Brave New Worlds, especially Picard) I just couldn't get through a couple episodes.  

Anyone else here feel the same?"
Fist of the North Star,Let it die. We were better off with no Trek at all than this bullshit.
Fist of the North Star,"I haven't seen Strange New Worlds, but Picard and Discovery didn't have the soul of Star Trek. Completely different kinds of shows. 

The original Star Trek (through Voyager, or maybe even Enterprise) was relatively laid back and focused a lot on stuff like ethical/philosophical questions, it had a sense of humor, and didn't take itself too seriously."
Fist of the North Star,"Honestly, as long as prodigy survives, that's all that matters to me. (Though lower Decks is decent too. Picard was a waste of too much money but it's ending anyway, and Discovery is an absolute pile of crap and the only trek I've been unable to get through.)"
Fist of the North Star,"I hope they still get to make Section 31, as the article suggests, because for me Michelle Yeoh was the best thing about *Discovery* by a wide margin."
Fist of the North Star,The Future of Trek was unclear when STD first aired.  I haven't seen anything to bring me back yet.
Fist of the North Star,"Funny thing is, Star Trek used to be pretty low brow. Special effects were never anything big, it was always about the stories. Unfortunately, they seem to have forgotten that."
Fist of the North Star,I’m thinking Halo is much more likely to get whacked than any ST series
Fist of the North Star,Some of the best Star Treks have come out recently. I hope they don’t cur any of them.
Fist of the North Star,But of course they’re going to cut the stuff that people actually like and keep what drives people away standard corporate bs.
Fist of the North Star,"The turtle croaks:  He's my son.


Genius, Sir Stewart!  You've transported us all yet again!"
Fist of the North Star,SNW and lower decks must stay. The rest can go.
Fist of the North Star,"Strange New Worlds as the main Trek, Lower Decks as the comedy Trek and Prodigy as the kids Trek. No more Discovery, Picard, the section 31 show or any Picard spinoffs unless its a Riker show lol

Edit: Called it."
Fist of the North Star,I hope something like The Orville is the future of Trek. Not the pathetic and ultimately unwatchable Discovery. (Multiple decade ST fan.)
Fist of the North Star,"Lol bye Burnham, you whisper crying joke of a Starfleet officer. 
What this “means” is Disco is done after this next season, likewise that Section 36 spin-off is toast unless they can talk Michael Dorn into headlining it, SNW might get a 3rd depending on how the just finished filming second does, the Starfleet Academy spinoff is F’ing toast (bye Tilly) lower decks will end after next season and Prodigy may or may not get a second season depending on viewership on Nickelodeon goes. 

My question is do these cuts mean Paramount does the smart thing and abandons the previously greenlit second season of Halo, or do they ride that dark horse straight into the ground because the checks already been cashed so why not."
Fist of the North Star,Doing better than the Orville. Blame that show for the writing in forspoken
Fist of the North Star,"Yep, force multiple shows on the viewership, most of which are awful, with plans for even more. What could possibly go wrong?

Please cut Picard and Discovery.  Don't even finish the current seasons.  By that meaning don't broadcast them, they're that  bad.  Picard is vomitous.  I mean dumb, cheap, predictable, and boring as hell.

Lower Decks can stay."
Fist of the North Star,Hot take: Disco is good but makes less accepting people uncomfortable
Fist of the North Star,"First off, it never should've made it this far in the first place. 

Second, if Paramount does cancel shows, the Outrage Bait assholes who have been saying everything was going to be canceled after every season are going to be insufferable with their ""WE TOLD YOU!!!""s, as if they actually predicted something instead of being the broken clock that happens to be right once.

/looks like I've pissed the fragile fanbois off again. Oh well. Brand recognition and blind brand loyalty is why we keep getting shitty reboots and pointless prequels  instead of something good or original."
Fist of the North Star,Well Picard is done so they already are spending less and that was where they would have to pay the actors the most wasn’t it?
Fist of the North Star,"Keeps Lower Decks and Strange New Worlds, give Discovery a final season.. or keep it around and just cap it at 10 episodes. It's not better than LD or SNW, so there's no reason to give it 3 or 4 more episodes per season over the others. I am not interest in Prodigy's cgi animation so I will I won't speak on it's quality but if they want to cut costs, then cap it at 10 as well.

They could also, you know, stop expanding the casts each season. Seems like every season of Discovery they think they need to add new people."
Fist of the North Star,"Picard’s done after this season and Disco is going into season 5 for some reason, so hopefully they’d be the first budget difference makers."
Fist of the North Star,"Leave it, theyre all good. Okay... Picard is lukewarm."
Fist of the North Star,3D voyager ?!?!
Fist of the North Star,"“Paramount has confirmed they will be cutting back spending on content overall as the media industry moves into a new phase of the streaming era.”


Means:


“We will monitor our competitors, and if they appear to be spending less money, we will do the same. Phew, it appears they are doing that now, so we will do that now. Start contacting the media with fluff articles so we can start telling people now that their particular shows will be impacted.”"
Fist of the North Star,Star Trek is pretty much the only reason I have a sub for Paramount + so I hope it stays
Fist of the North Star,Cut back Star Trek then Paramount+ will hit the cutting room floor… really the main reason to subscribe
Fist of the North Star,Yea S3 of Picard is bringing back the magic so far. Not like the S2 dumpster 🔥. The Pike show is not bad.
Fist of the North Star,Starfleet Academy show
Fist of the North Star,Maybe paramount just didn’t need a streaming service if they couldn’t afford it.
Fist of the North Star,"Star Trek was the only reason I had Paramount plus, they cut back on the content, I could use one less monthly sub."
Fist of the North Star,"Dump Alex Kurtzman, keep Terry Matalas and give it another shot."
Fist of the North Star,"Overstuffed, oversaturated, over stimulated, and over IT.  If they’d just cut the cost of their shitty streaming service they’d likely have more viewers … 🤷🏼‍♂️ that’s what keeps me away.  Every service wants more than ten dollars a month.  Plus the cable bill, plus the internet bill.  It’s just stupid. Shit adds up.  Not enough hours in the day to live work and look at all these streamers too.  For those old enough to remember,  you can bet Data’s emotion chip there’s going to be a very big  “dot.com” bubble type implosion very soon."
Fist of the North Star,"As someone who has never spent any time investment in Star Trek, I am absolutely blown away at the amount of content being produced for it right now. Growing up, I would occasionally catch episodes of The Next Generation on syndication after school, but that was basically it. I peripherally knew that movies got produced, and that there was things like Voyager and Deep Space 9. Now you guys have like what, 4 active shows running? From what I’ve heard the quality and reception really varies, but it must be nice to be a Star Trek fan these days."
Fist of the North Star,"This would suck because Strange New Worlds is IMO the best Trek show of all time.

Picard S3 has also been very strong so far with great episodes and great callbacks to past Trek.   Episode 3 has major DS9 implications that could indicate seeing some of those characters in the show."
Fist of the North Star,Link bait. Star Trek isn’t going anywhere.
Fist of the North Star,"It's easy, bump SNW to 30 episodes a year and cancel the rest!"
Fist of the North Star,As much as I want the franchise to move forward I'm never paying for yet another streaming service. My wallet is more important.
Fist of the North Star,"Give me SNW, Prodigy and LD and I'm fine."
Fist of the North Star,"That was the good one. I was so looking forward to more proper episodical stories, enough with all the damn long-arcs."
Fist of the North Star,"Yeah, I know.  I like *Star Trek: Strange New Worlds*, and thankfully, it doesn't require much knowledge of *Star Trek: Discovery*.  That show sucks, when is that going to die?  *Star Trek: Picard* finally got good, but this is the last season."
Fist of the North Star,It’s there most popular show. Now way they cut it.
Fist of the North Star,"Honestly, SNW isn’t that great either. It still has the same problems as all of nutrek where no one acts professional, they act like teenagers. It’s just bad writing"
Fist of the North Star,"Join us at r/Star_Trek_ to discuss all things trek!  Q’pla!

Edit: Not sure why I am getting downvoted. There are numerous Trek subs on Reddit. Anyone is free to join one, or all. Yes this one is new, but that’s no reason to downvote it. Every sub starts somewhere.  I love Trek and would be happy to talk Trek with anyone. Have a great day!"
Fist of the North Star,At least we would be spared the horrible cast choice they made for Kirk.
Fist of the North Star,What gets me is how they never have usable apps. How do they think I'm going to watch the content I pay for?
Fist of the North Star,They’d still figure out a way to not be profitable.
Fist of the North Star,"I watch the other ones, but I *enjoy* Lower Decks."
Fist of the North Star,Lower decks is so good
Fist of the North Star,Lower Decks and Strange New Worlds are great for my Trek fix: nerding out with LD on old trek references galore and solid enough stories + humour. SNW for a modern approach to one-off sci-fi stories (mostly). If either goes I’m going to weep.
Fist of the North Star,Prodigy is fantastic.  Such great arc's and character growth.
Fist of the North Star,I love lower decks. Really hope it stays too
Fist of the North Star,"Lower Decks, Strange New Worlds, Prodigy... we are really living in the second golden age of Trek, so it would be stupid to reduce existing shows.

Picard is so so... but even Discovery is more fun than some of the original shows (DS9).

They can cut the upcoming projects. Who needs a Section 31 show? The only reason I want it is because of Georgiou. They can easily find more promising concept for her... or to sneak her into SNW."
Fist of the North Star,Six seasons and a movie!
Slam Dunk, This felt like a Joke Swap episode.
Slam Dunk,The Jeff Koons joke was an all time dinger.
Slam Dunk,Che was vibing tonight.
Slam Dunk,you're gonna get me killed
Slam Dunk,I will admit Weekend Update has been a consistently quality segment.
Slam Dunk,"Weekend update is really entering its golden age with these two. The last two episodes have been outstanding and they are really finding their form this year. Last nights was one of my fav in a long time. It was so good, and outrageous"
Slam Dunk,Love Weekend Update with Che and Jost
Slam Dunk,https://www.reddit.com/r/television/comments/11cjmqu/snl_youtube_highlights_22523/
Slam Dunk,"Kinda feels like one of those college humor, don't laugh news, skits.

edit: I never said that was a bad thing.

you know im right. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcX_lXP977g  
they just keep a straight face better, and its not real news.  But it just feels similar."
Slam Dunk,"Finally, back to back zingers that aren't low-hanging-fruit political jabs at boring politicians"
Slam Dunk,"I remember when SNL used to be funny, this wasn't."
Slam Dunk,"Nothing about the Ohio disaster? Worst environmental disaster in US history, zero coverage outside of occasional Fox News segment."
Slam Dunk,Are they not all joke swap episodes? The last few I've seen have gotten some great reaction out of che and jost like they weren't expecting their lines.
Slam Dunk,He even stayed for the closing
Slam Dunk,by who?
Slam Dunk,I think this is the best it's ever been.  At least the best since Norm.
Slam Dunk,The originality of this comment really got me thinking.
Slam Dunk,Literally the cold open was trump in Ohio.
Slam Dunk,"Joke swap is a specific segment they do on special occasions. In the past few episodes they've been leaning more into the caricatures that they play on WU, to pretty hilarious results."
Slam Dunk,I thought i knew until now
Slam Dunk,tbh Update has always been a highlight even on the worst seasons of SNL. It's a tougher hang if you're watching reruns and don't get half the references but it can still be funny. Last week they aired an old Christopher Walken (and Foo Faighters) ep from 2003 with Fey/Fallon and some of the bits they were doing were great.
Slam Dunk,"I feel like it used to be, but I think they now just write some jokes for each other regularly.  You see moments every week where Che or Jost will tell a joke and die a little inside while the other goes ""Woah can't believe you just said that""."
Slam Dunk,"I think it's more that the WU writers feel comfortable leaning into the cringe element, they have a team that's separate from the standard SNL writers just focused on feeding jokes to Che and Jost. 

They've played with the line for several seasons, a couple years back there was a joke Colin told about how Morgan Wallen's streams went up after he was caught on tape yelling the n word, where Colin said ""which confirms my theory that if NBC just let me say it our ratings would skyrocket""."
Slam Dunk,"I've noticed this as well. Maybe they just figured that since they've done that segment a few times, they'd make an easter egg sorta thing out of it. Attentive viewers could catch a joke or two and go ""Che definitely wrote that for Jost""."
Slam Dunk,"""I swear, I was gonna give all the money BAWK!""

Colin's reaction to that told me he did not see that coming."
Slam Dunk,"this show is the epitome of vulgarity=funny

i am not a fan"
Slam Dunk,I saw this seems like it could be decent
Slam Dunk,Fuck this cartoon
Slam Dunk,Not funny. Couldn't get through the entire episode as I hadn't laughed once 15 minutes in.
Slam Dunk,"Great show don't watch it, bitch bois"
Slam Dunk,"Seems pretty stupid.   Couldn't get through the first episode.  It's like, a cartoon is just yelling at me in one tone through the entire episode.   Has some cute lines but there's no charm to go with the vulgarity."
Slam Dunk,Saw the first two minutes and it's already pretty damn funny to me.
Slam Dunk,"This is more South Park style animation. It is not for me. Why is it most US studios think animation only works as low brow comedy? Or worse still that it only works when it is packed full of crude juvenile humour? 

I’d love it if someone went out on a limb and gave us an animated drama or even just an actual comedy show aimed at an adult audience. So much potential in the medium is just squandered on this sort of overdone ‘comedy”. 

I watched the trailer and would not watch Hoops if you offered to pay me. It looks so AWFUL!"
Slam Dunk,"same, throwing dick jokes every two sentences is not really good writting"
Slam Dunk,"If you think the humour is in the vulgarity, and you even really noticed the ""vulgarity"", you might be a bit sensitive...

That is definitely not where the humour is coming from on the show. Yeah, there is a lot of swearing. There is a lot of swearing in any adult media lol

The humour is mostly in the failure of the characters, like your typical everyman animated sitcom. He's supposed to be relatable because he fails, a lot, and the humour is supposed to be in the various ways he fails. It's not high art, nor at all original, but there is plenty there beyond vulgarity.

If all you can see is the swearing, perhaps the Flintstones or Scooby Doo are more your speed. Swearing is really not what the humour is attempting to rely on or lean into here, and the swearing isn't really that heavy anyways. It's simply targeted at an adult audience. Adults swear. A lot."
Slam Dunk,"its more like bobs burger, bojack horseman, big mouth,animation styl.

southpark si more like cardboard moving around"
Slam Dunk,"LOL yeah didn’t work for South Park, Rick and Morty, or Robot Chicken. Not like they ever won any emmys or any other awards for their writing...oh wait"
Slam Dunk,"I dont mind swearing and vulgarity, i just felt they use it with drugs and sex to be edgy but it fell flat for me, kind of like old people trying to be cool"
Slam Dunk,He probably meant humor-wise but he hasn't even watched a single episode so he really doesn't know what he's talking about anyway.
Slam Dunk,"The former two really don't.......

I mean they might have it... but not that much.

South Park is very hit or miss, but some episodes are quite poignant social commentary."
Slam Dunk,"The humour is not really meant to be in those things, though..."
Slam Dunk,"hoops is not funny all they do is being super vulgar but without  all the joke.

Realy dotn like it after watching the first 3 ep."
Slam Dunk,"You have no idea what you're talking about. I'd love to hear how many episodes of Robot Chicken you've actually seen lol. 

Robot Chicken has SIX Emmy awards and has a total of 21 nominations. Some for animation, but most for being a generally outstanding show. This is a show almost completely centered around dick and fart jokes. It's a fan-fucking-tastic show.

Rick and Morty has ONE emmy and three nominations. Notably, R&M is 13 best tv show all time on IMDB."
Slam Dunk,"There is plenty of humour beyond the rather tame ""vulgarity"". If you can't see it because there is too much swearing for you, maybe adult animation isn't something you enjoy."
Slam Dunk,God I am so ready for this
Slam Dunk,"I really hope they get deep into the personal life and the baseball/gambling thing.

Damn, I'm so excited for this. It doesn't fully satisfy my sports urge but I couldn't really ask for something better the MJ"
Slam Dunk,I had forgotten that Netflix was involved in this too.

Slam Dunk,"
>Whatever your opinion on him or his program is irrelevant: It was one of the few shows that pretty much everyone in my family mutually enjoyed

What a weird juxtaposition of statements."
Slam Dunk,It’s a good show and I hope so
Slam Dunk,"I hope so. I love Tosh. He always really shined on the show when he wasn't playing the character version of himself, best seen in the web redemption interviews or semi-improvised segments like when he would give a full movie plot summary. I'm sure he has enough money to never need to work again, and it's possible he just sticks with stand-up but I'd definitely give his next project a shot if he does something else on tv."
Slam Dunk,"I guess I’m….sorry I created a downvote landmine? I know he isn’t everyone’s flavor, but I just asked if anyone knew what was going on. From what I gather, he’s doing live shows here and there, but I had just assumed, primarily for the sake of his crew, that there’d be news by now."
Slam Dunk,I've been wondering this myself. I don't even think Comedy Central replays his show except on the app maybe. That channel is a dead husk of it's former self. Fuck Comedy Central
Slam Dunk,Lol yeah Daniel Tosh Was a legend back in the day but his routine is kind of old and stale now.
Slam Dunk,[removed]
Slam Dunk,With any luck no. Never.
Slam Dunk,He still does that character voice in Paradise PD?  I haven't watched any of his other stuff.
Slam Dunk,"His style of work is simply no longer seen as safe from a legal standpoint. The way he pranked his crew, or used them for his stunts, has always been a liability but is far more likely to be an issue now. At the very least you would have to require them all to sign a lot of waivers which is not something he did previously."
Slam Dunk,Daniel Tosh is hilarious and doing shows in Vegas now. Totally worth checking his LIVE show in Vegas at the Mirage Hotel if you haven't yet! If you are planning on visiting Vegas soon and need access to discounted show tickets....then here you go: https://vegas.vdvm.net/c/1296419/269518/4221?prodsku=2087&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.vegas.com%2Fshows%2Fcomedy%2Fdaniel-tosh-las-vegas%2F&intsrc=PUI2\_1879  I own a Travel & Event Agency so I have access to discounted tickets that you can take advantage of. Thank me later. (=
Slam Dunk,"I was looking around the internet for the same question. I just saw his live comedy act, and he was absolutely awesome! I hope he comes back to tv. If you can catch him live, you should."
Slam Dunk,South Park parades Comedy Central's corpse around Weekend at Bernie's style
Slam Dunk,"""Your opinion is irrelevant; but here's my opinion"""
Slam Dunk,"Every time I mention Daniel tosh on Reddit I get fucking crucified hahah, I would love to see him come back"
Slam Dunk,This sub is really bad (or really good?) at downvoting posts just because they don't like the program or actor.
Slam Dunk,"There’s a 24-hour Tosh.0 channel on the PlutoTV app, which is free."
Slam Dunk,Charlamagne is actually pretty known in the hip hop community tbf
Slam Dunk,"So much this. 

I'm quite capable of watching YouTube videos all by myself, thank you, don't need a narrator. 

I also choose not to exercise that ability."
Slam Dunk,"That was brickleberry, he’s not in paradise pd"
Slam Dunk,I’d abandon my wife and 7 month old child right now to work for him.
Slam Dunk,Nice plug 👍 love Tosh
Slam Dunk,That and reruns of the Office. And I assume some people watch the Daily Show
Slam Dunk,And were losing them to streaming too in a few years.
Slam Dunk,"You know exactly what I meant. Plus, key word being ""your"": I don't need ""your"" positive or negative opinion on Daniel Tosh to answer a question about if anyone had heard any news."
Slam Dunk,">Whatever your opinion on him or his program is irrelevant

Hard to have a conversation when OP says this in the post. I'd assume that's where the downvotes are coming from."
Slam Dunk,Try mentioning walking dead on here. Even in its prime where it's viewer numbers were super high you'd have the insufferable shit heads of this sub down voting everything saying how bad it is.
Slam Dunk,"Yeah OP is definitely in a bit of a bubble, The Breakfast Club was a regular stop for Democratic Presidential Candidates last year, dude’s popular."
Slam Dunk,[removed]
Slam Dunk,"Yeah, just don’t confuse well known with well respected."
Slam Dunk,"So your point boils down to ""even though I won't watch it and it has no effect on my life, I would also like others to not be able to watch it either""?"
Slam Dunk,His character in Brickleberry was in one episode of Paradise PD.
Slam Dunk,Lol sadly that idea makes more sense than being married anyway lol
Slam Dunk,It's a pleasure! 👍
Slam Dunk,I think they have Friends now too
Slam Dunk,"Well it's a discussion thread and I'll give any opinion I want, but thanks"
Slam Dunk,"Lmao, you really only wanna hear your own opinions huh"
Slam Dunk,"Thank they just meant for the fans who like the show, just not tactful in the way they described it."
Slam Dunk,Not that surprising based on their comment history. I forget about the breakfast club for a little but it always comes back up between the Soulja Boy memes a few years back and Tekashi interviews
Slam Dunk,It was also with Charlemagne that Biden also made his infamous “you ain’t black” quip.
Slam Dunk,do you assume all black celebrities are rappers?
Slam Dunk,"1. Charlamagne is not a rapper, which is pretty weird you’d just assume this without doing a simple google search, but a radio personality like Howard Stern (not comparing the two in quality to be clear). Also he was on a few popular MTV shows a few years ago that were fairly popular with my generation (Guy Code and Wild ‘n Out). Seems to me it just doesn’t fit your interest which is fine.

2. You’re comparing two different forms of media consumption (internet vs. television) with two vastly different target viewers.

I used to love watching Tosh’s stuff, I even enjoyed brickleberry. But clearly analytics or changing times just didn’t match up with what Comedy Central was going for."
Slam Dunk,I'll never understand people who unnecessarily wish ill or discomfort or disappointment or loss or harm or misfortune on innocent strangers.  It's like the kid who pulled wings off insects never learned to stop.
Slam Dunk,"Yes, yes it is.

Hey look, there's a website, it's called YouTube.com. All the videos on Tosh.0 are there! You can make your own show, but with videos *you* like, *and* your commentary will be funnier! (Even if you're not funny! Because while I do think Daniel Tosh can be hilarious... that show was just stupid, and nothing he said was at all funny.)

Most of it goes back to friends going ""dude, you don't like Tosh.0? C'mon, watch it, it's hilarious!"" Then they'd put on Tosh.0... and it wasn't funny. At all."
Slam Dunk,When it comes to Daniel Tosh yea
Slam Dunk,"And Seinfeld next month.  But really that is all the network is now.  South Park, reruns, and mostly terrible movies."
Slam Dunk,Right? Google is for looking up information. Reddit is for discussion.
Slam Dunk,And when Hillary pulled a bottle of hot sauce out her purse.

Uncle,Based on professional bodybuiilder Jack LaLanne.
Uncle,***SWOOP ME!***
Uncle,I WONT GO WHEEL CHAIR
Uncle,I love Martin Short but this is probably one of the (if not the) worst episodes of the original run. Found his character annoying and one note. I often skip this episode.
Uncle,Where do I recognize the big guy from?
Uncle,Worst. Episode. Ever.

Uncle,You could have ended up watching Clifford. Weird trip
Uncle,This might be the only acceptable way to watch this movie
Uncle,I need to hear about all this swooping going on
Uncle,But then you skip out on the only Tobias and Lucille 2 interaction
Uncle,"Seasons 4 and 5 you skip, everything in seasons 1-3 are gold."
Uncle,Not nearly as bad as the Mr F arc
Uncle,Agreed although this episodes has a lot of solid Tobias jokes.
Uncle,It was like a crossover episode to a non-existent TV show. Martin Short hammered his style of comedy in AD and it fell flat. I wonder if he watched a single episode before his appearance.

Uncle,That's essentially who Fester is tho.
Uncle,Fred Armisen can be amusingly annoying and annoyingly annoying. You never know which side he's going to fall on but I'll always tune in to see if it's one of his good days.
Uncle,Have you never seen an Addams Family movie? Fred Armisen played Fester extremely well
Uncle,"Fred Armisen seems to have taken inspiration from Christopher Lloyd's Fester. I liked it quite a lot, to be honest. However, I think his portrayal was good because Fester is supposed to be the oddball of the Addams anyway"
Uncle,"If that’s your opinion, your issue is with the character, not the actor"
Uncle,"Watch the OG Adam's Family, then come back to us"
Uncle,"Weirdly, and admittedly, I hate Fred Armisen, but I actually loved his take on fester. It reminded me of Jackie Coogan’s fester from the original show."
Uncle,Gomez killed it for me. No chemistry at all with morticia. 😤
Uncle,"If you aren’t a fan of the Addams family, you’re not gonna get it"
Uncle,"Having watched the 90s version of addams family and only that version out of all of them, my take on the entire families portrayal aside from wednesday seemed horrible."
Uncle,"I actually finished the last 3 episodes of Wednesday last night and was delighted when Armisen showed up as Fester.  Then, I turned right around and watched Addams Family Values and laughed so hard at the whole movie after not having watched it in years.  Christoper Lloyd was, of course, brilliant (heh heh) as Fester.  It was fun to compare the two characters.  I think Armisen did really well.

It was also cool to compare the two Wednesdays.  And, Christina Ricci’s performances as two different characters in the film and the new series.  

I’m sorry you didn’t enjoy Armisen’s performance.  But, you have a right to your opinion.  Hope you will be able to enjoy Season 2."
Uncle,"I love Lloyd’s version but Armisen is far more similar to Coogan’s original live action take, and even more so like the 73 animated version (also Coogan)"
Uncle,"Fred nailed the character. I think your problem is with Fred as an actor or who the character is. He played fester how fester is supposed to be played. 

The real tragedy in the show was gomez. If the character was the bullseye of a target Guzman hit the cow in the pasture behind him in the opposite direction. I don't think his acting type was even close to being the right casting. Gomez is supposed to be suave and a romantic. Guzman makes him look like a bumbling dude that got lucky hitting way over his head with morticia and knows it."
Uncle,I think he's an upper tier fester imo.  No one will be able to live up to Christopher Lloyd but Fred Armisen did a great job.
Uncle,"I liked Fester! Though, I might be biased, since I'm a fan of the actor."
Uncle,"Fred Armisen crushed it as fester - I think you just dislike the character... which is fine.  He's supposed to be fairly annoying in general"
Uncle,I was prepared to hate Fred Armisen as Uncle Fester when I heard he had that part. I honestly thought he did great. He was able to blend the spirit of silliness and fun of Uncle Fester from the 60’s sitcom with the darkness from the 90’s. I felt like he brought something new to the table. I’m a huge Addams Family fan and I’m so glad I gave him a chance.
Uncle,"I actually liked the change,  it took away the blundering idiot he's been for so long and turned him into an eccentric thief.  I  think that what's bothering you is that very change and it's understandable but they also changed Wednesday and pugsly making her more dark and angry him a scaredy cat.  Gomez is not the dashingly handsome man he's been in the past and Mortisha falls more in line with demands for body positive proponents.   Really everyone has changed except for Thing."
Uncle,I really loved Christopher Lloyd's Fester more tbh
Uncle,"made me want to go back and watch the addams family movie with christopher lloyd as fester, its aged but its good!"
Uncle,You go right to jail
Uncle,Armisen was very true to the character.  I liked it.
Uncle,That’s just who Fester is in the tv show though!
Uncle,Uncle Fester is much more true to his character than Morticia is.
Uncle,"I wish Armisen leaned more into the darkness that UF has. I mean I get it, my daughter never have seen Addams Family liked that character the least."
Uncle,I loved it actually haha. A lil bit of a jump-scare but overall loved it
Uncle,I liked him.  He was an over the top character and that is how he was played here.
Uncle,"From “the worst character I’ve seen in my life” to “lol nbd why everyone so mad?”

Absolute backdown"
Uncle,"Netflix Uncle Fester seems to be heavily inspired from cartoon uncle Fester from the early 90s. Idk how much Addams Family material you’ve consumed in your life, I would have to assume it was very little for you to have this shit take."
Uncle,"I haven’t watched Wednesday, but I know Fred Armisen plays Fester, and you just 100% described Fred Armisen."
Uncle,"Yeah dude this is a bad take. He was great 
I think you just don’t like the Addams family"
Uncle,I disagree strongly with this take.
Uncle,Context: https://youtu.be/JjPVBOjlseI
Uncle,You're going to reddit prison for this one
Uncle,"If I may.  I didn't think the performance by Fred Arminsen is the best version of Fester, but it ended up not being as bad as I thought."
Uncle,"Not an Armisen fan. I did however think he did a decent job, but would have rather had any other actor."
Uncle,"Wow, they are dragging you over the coals. I feel the same way though"
Uncle,It was cringey and not in the way that is in line with the character. He was more Marty Mcfly soft cheese than the fester I would have expected. Ill join you in the -400's.
Uncle,Worse than Gomez? They did that character dirty. I like Guzman in many roles but this one makes no sense.
Uncle,"dude ""sharing his opinion"" gets defensive when other opinions show up, cool.

&#x200B;

Armisen nailed Fester, as the character was written in the source material. I hope he gets more screen time in season 2."
Uncle,"Those edits. Woof. 


If you are going to express an opinion, especially a controversial one, you need to be prepared to be challenged without whining about it. 

This idea that opinions are somehow sacred and beyond scrutiny is useless and weak minded. If you don't want your opinions challenged you should keep them to yourself."
Uncle,"I love this Fester and was excited to finally see him turn up in the show. Very true to the character, almost more to the '60s show than the '90s movies, even. You are entitled to your opinion. Even when you're wrong. ;)"
Uncle,His character was delightful. Total highlight of the show for me!
Uncle,"same vibe people had with gomez being played by guzman those who are familiar with the source material will be fine with it.

and lets be real the shoes of fester,gomez,morticia,and wednsday are literally impossible to fill given who wore them before.  so try to make new ones and if it doesnt work oh well but other times it does work."
Uncle,He’s perfect in the role. My wife noticed me big mug smiling during the episode and mentioned it. I said I’m just so happy they got a perfect Uncle. He’s absolutely perfect to a T
Uncle,I couldn't buy into Gomez.. I hear ya.
Uncle,OP is certified wack. Fester was my fav part.
Uncle,"You must be 19, Fester was a very Fester character, Gomez was the tragedy compared to all other Addams productions."
Uncle,"In general, I find hyperbolic statements like this instantly tell me that the review’s opinion is not worth reading."
Uncle,Sounds like the problem is that the show is just over your head.
Uncle,"When Fred Armisen came on the scene for the first time on SNL, I immediately was put off by him. Just could not get on board. However, as he has progressed through his career, I am really warming up to him and I quite enjoyed him as Uncle Fester! I thought he did a great job of making it his own but keeping it OG."
Uncle,Well how else are you going to top Christopher Lloyd? Those are some big shoes to fill. Fred Armisen did a fine job I thought. Fester is supposed to be weird and he is definitely a weirdo lol.
Guilty Crown,I hope the story is good. It'll certainly look good.
Guilty Crown,netflix should produce the new berserk anime. 
Guilty Crown,I just want to hear that EGOIST is doing a song for the show.  
Guilty Crown,I hear an echo in my ghost. 
Guilty Crown,"GitS and Psycho-Pass were both absolutely fantastic, I can't wait for this, though I do want more GitS/Psycho-Pass. Why are good anime always so short- and the shitty ones go on forever?"
Guilty Crown,"GITS is one of my favorite movies/series of all time. Thought provoking, cool, and animated well. Hopefully Netflix can replicate these qualities."
Guilty Crown,[deleted]
Guilty Crown,">a future in which scientists are experimenting on children to create superhuman beings, when something inevitably goes awry

Annnnd I'm asleep."
Guilty Crown,"Cool. Now Young Justice, maybe?"
Guilty Crown,"I am excited that this anime is a Netflix Original. Now it can finally have a budget it needs with limited to no constraints. I always notice in many animes I have seen that they had to cut back a lot of their content due to budget.

All I am asking for this Netflix Original Anime is not to have any fanservice that would make the horny weibos thirsty. This is my number one reason why I mostly stopped watching anime."
Guilty Crown,It be nice if the animation was original GITS quality but that'll neeeeeever happen. 
Guilty Crown,Original content produced with collaboration with studios in East Asia. So it begins. I wonder if all the major media companies in US understand what Netflix is doing and how much trouble they are in. A media company that straddle the two great continents and in prime positions to distribute content to both markets. Netflix will *buy* Disney in 20 years.
Guilty Crown,You had me at GITS. But I forgot that Production I.G. did Evangelion stuff. Guess I'll have to watch this for sure. Those 2 bodies of work are my ATF anime for sure!
Guilty Crown,Finally a Catcher in the Rye tv show!
Guilty Crown,How is netflix the only company not fucking up?
Guilty Crown,Production IG isn't what they used to be and that latest GITS movie was pretty lame.
Guilty Crown,"This will be Kazuto Nakazawa's, the person directing Perfect Bones, directorial debut for a full length series. GitS doesn't have anything to do with the production of this anime. Yes Production I.G. produced GitS, but what really matters is the staff creating the anime. I wouldn't get your hopes up. A lot has changed at that studio since the original GitS movie and SAC were released."
Guilty Crown,"This is great news. I hope that Netflix really starts getting into more anime. They have a lot of great stuff on there like Full Metal Alchemist, Gurren Lagan, Mushi-shi (hope it is still there, no second season yet though), Fate/Zero, Fate/Stay Night Unlimited Blade Works, fairy tale,  knights of Sidonia. But lets be honest it is missing some of the essential anime, and it is weird you can't find them anywhere online. I mean Evangelion, Cowboy Bebop, Berserk (not the movies), any of the Gundam series, Macross, Yu Yu Hakusho. All of these are great but no where to be seen and it is really odd IMO that they aren't put on streaming yet. "
Guilty Crown,"Whatever happened to that anime that got a lot of kickstarter hype.. ""under the dog""? "
Guilty Crown,Best intro ever 
Guilty Crown,The episode where the robot helps the little girl look for her cat or dog made me cry. Can't remember which episode but I watched it a while ago.
Guilty Crown,"Interesting investment. I'd certainly like to see Netflix invest in some animated shows and films that venture outside the family friendly zone. Not to knock, I just enjoy variety. F is for Family was a great start for producing original animated content aimed at a mature audience. Would love to see some short films made from studios and artists from around the world."
Guilty Crown,"I'm excited, the other anime they did was pretty good. The seven deadly sins. Pretty good dub work too, I usually watch subtitled."
Guilty Crown,"Original or not, Netflix needs so reevaluate their Anime content. It's lacking. "
Guilty Crown,"And in this thread we have countless people who liked 1 or 2 shows but hate everything else about anime so they want to change a whole fucking medium to suit their tastes. And the anime they like? Tokyo Ghoul and Mirai Nikki.

Really staying true to the cliche."
Guilty Crown,"I'll hold my excitement until they release it.  Netflix is killing it with their original series but anime is a different beast. The style of the artwork is one thing but it's also about the action, over the top fight scenes, and usually a deep story that leaves you thinking. That's what attracted me to anime when I was younger. "
Guilty Crown,Sounds like a mix of Akira and possibly Zankyou no Terror 
Guilty Crown,Screw ghost in a shell I want ghost in a jar!
Guilty Crown,"YYYEEEEESSSSSS

Here's hoping to even half the greatness in GITS cerebral ideas or themes"
Guilty Crown,"Sweet, I will watch it. "
Guilty Crown,Netflix just give me more of the cooking anime and call it a day please
Guilty Crown,"Hopefully a new IP.
GitS has been getting shit on lately :("
Guilty Crown,"I'm guessing there'll be no J-dub/E-sub option for this one. 

Well, I'm crossing my fingers either way. "
Guilty Crown,Your move Japan. 
Guilty Crown,My heart just exploded.
Guilty Crown,Neat! They did a solid job with seven deadly sins.
Guilty Crown,"Good, but I'm more concerned with Seven Deadly Sins season 2"
Guilty Crown,"I've only watched a few anime series.  My son asked me to watch Attack on Titan with him, and then I stumbled across Knights of Sidonia.  I've enjoyed them both.  Is KoS a Netflix production?"
Guilty Crown,"So it will involve technologically innovative ideas and gratuitous boob shots, and the Wachowskis will make a movie that has numerous stylistic and narrative similarities in around 2 years?"
Guilty Crown,":gets excited:  

""so it’s unclear if we'll see it air before the end of 2016""  

DAMN IT!!!"
Guilty Crown,"From where I sit now and how I use Netflix it is crazy to think that only a handful of years ago I was staring at ""Gabriel Inglesias - Fluffy"" in the face and asking myself if may be I could watch Memento one more time and then cancel my subscription.  I didn't. FFW to now and Netflix is just on loop in the background of my fucking life.  New anime series? I'll bite!"
Guilty Crown,[deleted]
Guilty Crown,"I enjoyed Ghost in the  shell many years ago, although mostly for the animation and action. Shit was so confusing back then."
Guilty Crown,awesome news :]
Guilty Crown,Also the studio behind Attack on Titan and Psycho Pass.
Guilty Crown,Nice! Got a stiffy just reading GitS. :) 
Guilty Crown,Thats great but as I was reading I hoped the title was gonna say Studio Ghibli
Guilty Crown,"On another note, why does Netflix refer to Knights of Sidonia as a Netflix Original?"
Guilty Crown,Oh hell yes.
Guilty Crown,Yeh hope story is fresh like attack on titans
Guilty Crown,Netflix is just flexing at this point.
Guilty Crown,"Hopefully this begins to shift Japans Sluggish adaptation to the global market. I know Production I.G and BONES has tried to make anime more.... International. For years now.

Hopefully this really kicks the anime industry in the face and tells all the studios to wake the fuck up to the rest of the world."
Guilty Crown,I got goosebumps reading that! How exciting! Nostalgic memories are flooding back!
Guilty Crown,"What really sucks is that there is like no fucking anime on the Dutch Netflix and we cant use VPN's anymore.

In general the Dutch netflix sucks ... gonna have to cancel after I have seen my shows sadly.


BUT THEY JUST ADDED DEATH NOTE! LIKE LITERALLY, JUST YESTERDAY, AWESOME! "
Guilty Crown,"Please hope it's a Japanese cast, if not then not interested. "
Guilty Crown,OH MY GOD YES. YES. YES. Please don't be horrible. Please be good.
Guilty Crown,"Production I.G. also made Kuroko's Basketball and Psycho Pass. Both were enjoyable animes, I hopes this series works out."
Guilty Crown,"They did one original Anime already, right?  That super unwatchable 3d animated one?

Hopefully this one is much better."
Guilty Crown,...and so it begins.
Guilty Crown,They need Yoko Kanno
Guilty Crown,Netflix trying to steal those Hulu nerds
Guilty Crown,"Please be seinen, please be seinen."

Guilty Crown,"I would love it if Netflix started funding a lot of anime, and them being a global company they would be willing to fund anime premises off the beaten path. I feel like anime has been in a creative rut for a while now."
Guilty Crown,Animation is REALLY expensive. I hope they don't regret it.
Guilty Crown,"For those who may not of heard of Production I.G.

Guilty Crown,<he still watches anime
Guilty Crown,This is a compelling reason for me to get Netflix.  :D
Guilty Crown,When they get an anime series on their platform they should include both the English dub and the original audio. I was disappointed they didn't have the English dub of Attack on Titan.
Guilty Crown,Netflix is doing so many things right.
Guilty Crown,I like how in the thumbnail the girl has a shirt on. In the movie I watched I could see her boobies.

Guilty Crown,Netflix and Studio Ghibli is my dream.. I hope it happens.
Guilty Crown,will it be good? i think it will be good
Guilty Crown,"I liked Knights of Cydonia on Netflix, still waiting on the 3rd season..."
Guilty Crown,">There's also no artwork attached, so it’s unclear if we'll see it air before the end of 2016.

The article author is a true sadist! "
Guilty Crown,Sweet - that will look amazing no doubt.
Guilty Crown,I'm glad this article referred to Knights of Sidonia properly. It bothered me so much that they called it a 'Netflix Original' when it first came to Netflix.
Guilty Crown,[deleted]
Guilty Crown,And Evangelion! and Attack on Titan! This shit is going to be good. Will not fail. 
Guilty Crown,My hopes are high. Its so hard to find anime that doesn't suffer from all the retarded tropes that make it unwatchable.
Guilty Crown,"Get inside my eyeballs, my body is ready "
Guilty Crown,"I remember when they were making the Iron Man Anime, the trailer looked fabulous. Such details of drawn Iron Man suit, and then they used CGI for the suits :/"
Guilty Crown,Can't wait. Does anyone know when attack on titan season two is going to be English dubbed? I ha e been waiting g or that one forever too...
Guilty Crown,"Production I. G. has done a lot of stuff.  The animation quality is usually very high, but there's no guarantee of story quality (see Guilty Crown).  This is cool, but I wouldn't go in expecting a spiritual sequel to GITS."
Guilty Crown,Why can't they make more ghost in the shell just that goes to netflix. I really love ghost in the shell.
Guilty Crown,"Ugh, there's already a Netflix original anime, and it's full of fan service..."
Guilty Crown,Don't forget their first original show Knights of sydonia. That was pretty damn good. The 3D animation was incredible 
Erased,[deleted]
Erased,"I love Twin Peaks. Even season 2, which is better on rewatch. That middle section is a bit rough, but it all pulls together in the end, and there are no fully bad episodes.

That being said, the Evelyn plot can go to hell. It's completely pointless.

I've always felt that it was the victim of a last minute rewrite, possibly due to Lynch and Frost returning for the final few episodes.

It's structurally weird. James rides off from Twin Peaks on his bike leaving Donna behind, meets Evelyn, gets in over his head (not easy with that head), and Donna saves his ass. So James...rides off on his bike leaving Donna behind again. What exactly was achieved here?

The logical thing would be for James to realize how much he needs Donna, and for them to leave town (and the show) together, getting a mutual happy ending. Buuuut then someone decided that Donna had to stick around so she could be one of the decoy victims in the beauty pageant and also a prop in Ben Horne's arc where it turns out she's his kid. So she needs to stay. So James just leaves, which he was doing anyway. So the subplot might as well have never happened.

Just my theory."

Talk about jumping the shark. And I know there was an IRL reason for it, but I can still be peeved the writers handled it that way."
Erased,"euron from game of thrones

i know he’s in the books, but at that point in season 7 we’re already beyond them, so who cares. shoehorning him into the dany storyline, creating this fake love triangle, etc.

Cordelia & Connor. It really is a fabulous season outside of that story line. A story line which we have since confirmed was designed by Joss Whedon solely to punish Charisma Carpenter for being pregnant. So it's shit both on it's face as a storyline and behind the scenes."
Erased,Friday Night Lights Series 2 - The storyline with Landry and Tyra. You know the one.
Erased,Stranger Things - X-Men episode
Erased,"I'm rewatching The Mandalorian to get ready for season 3 and I think the answer for this show is easily Boba Fett. All the other character reappearances make sense for the overall plot of the season of Mando tracking down a Jedi to hand Grogu off to... except Boba Fett. He inexplicably pops up out of absolutely *nowhere*, has nothing to do with the plot other than promising to help Din track Grogu down (which Din does via Bill Burr without much help from Boba Fett anyway) and then he leaves.

And then yeah, Book of Boba Fett was weirdly bad. His motivation throughout is unclear and not a whole lot *really* seems to happen. He takes over a town in Tattooine for some reason, I guess relating to him wanting to have some kind of clan? Family? I have no idea. It has nothing to do with Din or Grogu though.

It'd be pretty easy to retcon him out of the episode where Grogu gets kidnapped, simply not make Book of Boba Fett, and then start Mandalorian S3 with the two (incredible) episodes of Book of Boba Fett that are entirely focused on Din and/or Grogu... and don't feature Boba Fett at all."

Erased,The leviathan arc from Supernatural. I'd miss the Charlie character but maybe they'd find another way to bring her on.
Erased,"How I Met Your Mother - the entire ending storyline.  Throwing away the character growth from Robin and Barney, turning The Mother into a way for Robin to not want kids but still end up with Ted, ignoring the years of storytelling that Ted and Robin just don't work together, etc.  All so they could use the ending they filmed 8 years earlier that no longer fit the story they had told."
Erased,The X-Files: Whatever chunks of vomit Chris Carter strung into a failed attempt at a coherent mythology post-Season 7. *Especially* the Seasons 9-10 mytharc.
Erased,The theater troupe in season 3 of Deadwood. Might have worked if s4 had happened and it had been capitalized on in some way. But as it is it's the one part of the show that feels entirely pointless on rewatch. Brian Cox is quite a talent to waste on that plotline as well.
Erased,"Gilmore Girls - Rory and Dean getting back together when he was married to Lindsey.  Dean was so pathetic by this time, and it was completely unnecessary to the storyline.  Also putting it in the same episode when they finally put Lorelai & Luke together."

Erased,Toby’s arc in the final season of the West Wing.
Erased,The mystic parts of Rambaldi in Alias. Alias was a decent show about spies when Rambaldi was not a focal point.

Erased,Haley getting pregnant with twins in modern family
Erased,The main victim in True Detective S2. Nobody was invested in that character and it made the whole story convoluted.
Erased,"Doctor Who and the Timeless Child. Over time I have started to accept it, but it wasn’t handled well, blatantly broke the “show, don’t tell” rule, and was literally chucked down the garbage chute in the end."
Erased,"I’d adjust the ending of White Lotus season 2 to be a huge misunderstanding between Tania/Portia and the gays. This would require erasing Jack’s drunken ramblings to Portia and the picture of Greg in the villa. I’d want Tania to be coked up and paranoid that the gays were trying to kill her, so she’d kill them just like in the show, but in fact they were just fabulous and trying to show her a good time. Then she’d still get away with it because of her wealth."
Erased,The fake serial killer plot in the Wire season 5. That plot weighed down an otherwise fantastic season.
Erased,Person of Interest: Removing any of the out of nowhere romance between Caviezel and Taraji P Henson's characters. They were a great duo without any romance needed. Having Reese profess his love for her just as she dies was ridiculous and unearned.
Erased,REVENGE: David ending up being alive the whole time and falling (back) in love with Victoria
Erased,The aging pill from Oz.
Erased,"The Impossible Girl from Doctor Who. The convoluted plot turned Clara into a plot device instead of a character. Fortunately she got better, but series 7B was rough."
Erased,I also hated the storyline in Orange is the New Black with the panty business
Erased,Brooklyn Nine Nine's baby storyline. Just felt like they threw it in because that's what the average viewer expects as the natural progression of love between two people. But it felt kinda forced and didn't pay off in a comedic sense. I love the rest of the series but I cringe a little bit on rewatches.
Erased,"Season 4 of Prison Break. Even if they kept doing the show, and they shouldn't have, the whole Homeland Security stuff was just dog shit."
Erased,Enterprise:  the entire temporal cold war.  Without it we might have been actually given a show about a fledgling Starfleet/Federation and all the intrigue and political drama that promises.
Erased,The timeless child from Doctor Who... you know what? The entire 13th Doctor!
Erased,"Kwan Ha's story in Halo. Like literally just delete the character.

I remember when S1 finished realising ""hang on, her entire story was fucking pointless and had zero impact on anything"" despite so much time spent covering it.

I'm not watching S2 of Halo so I don't particularly care, but it still strikes me as one of the easiest fixes of easily removing something to make a show better."

Erased,"Lucifer's daughter

The whole plot of having to abandon her for 18 years, because he did it before, so if he doesn't do it this time she'll cease to exist?  That's all garbage.

Having Lucifer be forced to abandon Chloe and his daughter for the last 18 years of Chloe's life is just ridiculous, and soured what I thought was a decent final season outside of that."

Erased,"SOA: Basically everything after Opie’s death. I know that’s cheating sorry. But Opie’s funeral might as well have been the series finale. 

Community: The stuff with Jeff’s dad. It never goes anywhere til it does, and when it does, it’s a wet fart. Maybe it would’ve been better if s4 was run by Harmon but we’ll never know. 

Sopranos: Janice’s presence post s2. This one’s kind of unfair and overall I’m fine with it, it’s my favorite show ever. But I would’ve much preferred to see the rumored plans for s3 if Nancy Marchand didn’t die. Her ghost looms over the rest of the series by her personality playing out in AJ and Janice but it’s not the same and not done as well when they try to hit those points. Additionally, again while it’s all well and fine, there’s not a single storyline Janice is in from s3 on that she couldn’t have been replaced in OR that couldn’t have been just scrapped altogether. 

The Wire: The entire newspaper story in s5. Bad. Awful way to end the series. Wire deserved better. 

The Shield: I have two here. First, basically anything with Tina in the later seasons. Pointless character. Second, Julien’s personal life. What started out as arguably the second main story line of the show kind of just gets swept under the rug and barely mentioned later in the series. It ends up being a complete waste. And it shouldn’t have been."

I haven’t read the books so I’m not sure how that storyline is done there but it was atrocious in the show. Not sure if it was the writing, actor or something else but I absolutely hated when he would show up on the screen."

Erased,"PLL 🙌 

If >!Ezra was actually A!< as it certainly appears was the plan, the show becomes incredibly more sinister, believable, etc. and really could have been an all time great.

What they did instead was pretty unforgivable."
Erased,"How I met your mother — Barney and Robin never should have fallen in love with each other. That single decision basically ruined the last 2 seasons. That’s a little dramatic, there were still a bunch of good episodes, but it ruined the big story. And it also ruined a bunch of episodes.

Idk maybe the writers were so hacky at that point they wouldn’t have been able to write anything better. 

God I also just remembered Ted trying to tear down a building and the girl from house trying to stop him. And the captain. Fuck that guy sucked. Why did this one-note joke character play such a huge role in the last couple seasons, it wasn’t even a funny note. What the hell were they thinking"
Erased,"I'd erase Season 6 of LOST. There are some excellent moments (Terry O'Quinn throughout, Sun and Jin's acting on the sub, Jack's last scene), but overall it's a mess. The flash-sideways reality gets hyped up when Desmond wakes up from it, but it doesn't impact the main storyline *at all*, then you have a new faction of Others introduced that brings nothing to the table (even with Hiroyuki Sanada involved, the Temple episodes are a snooooze), and a bunch of seemingly important characters sidelined at the last minute (Widmore's plan doesn't matter, Sawyer gets nothing to do in the last season, etc.).

If the show ended on the season 5 finale, I think it would've pissed a lot of people off a la Sopranos, but it's an interesting ambiguous point to end the story on, and I think a lot of folks' headcanon endings would be more interesting than what we ended up with.

I know a lot of people will disagree with me on this, and I don't begrudge them. But I've always felt like a man without a country between the people who never liked Lost to begin with and the superfans who to this day see nothing wrong with the complete abandonment of the science vs. faith dichotomy and lean on the ""it was always about the characters!"" refrain when discussing plot failings."

poldark,The last season is the only one that's not adapted from the books. Agreed - it very much showed.
poldark,"I agree, it got really irritating"
poldark,"The last season was bad. Literally the only saving grace was the Bad Guy, what was his name? Oh yeah George Warleggan. He was very good in that season. Everyone else was super tiresome. 

In hindsight he was the best actor in the whole series. The doctor was quite good too."
poldark,"I guess I am easy to please, I enjoyed all episodes of all seasons. And I am not a chick..."
poldark,">Just in case you decided to binge it too, I have thus warned you.

The problem is you prefaced it by praising a show that is absolute twee drivel, which renders any other opinions suspect."
poldark,I also enjoyed this show! I found myself not very interested in the last seasons as well. But as a whole I’m a fan.
poldark,"I stopped watching because everyone was so horrible to each other on a personal level, lol. Can cope with the bleak situations, but bleak interpersonal relationships just depress me too much!

Good show for certainly the first few seasons though - no idea how many there were in the end."
poldark,[deleted]
poldark,"Yes. You're just hanging around waiting for Rahhhs to get his shirt off.

I watched every episode and looking back George ended up being the best thing in it. And he was the Bad Guy. He was the best actor of the lot of them though by a mile.

poldark,As a Cornishman I cant agree with this statement
poldark,">love drama with good writing  (based on books) and actors. I’m usually not a fan of this genre

Same here. With this type of shows it's kinda hit and miss for me. I love Downton Abbey and The Crown, but Outlander was too ""soapy"" for me."
poldark,"Outlander has become full on soap opera. This one is holding up well over time.

Love plays the part for half of the storyline but also rather acts as a motivator or cause to other issues that rise up. It is more level-headed. I call it a study of marriage."

poldark,"Oh my, I watch so many period dramas... Jamestown and Harlots are the latest I watched, they’re good though not as much as the ones above imo. The Starz shows about the Tudors are awesome (White Queen / White Princess / Spanish Princess). Versailles, about Louis XIV, is so beautiful to watch - they shot a lot of it in the actual castle. Obviously there’s Vikings / The Last Kingdom, if you like dark humor and enjoyed those two shows, you might like Norsemen... Emphasis on dark humor. Boardwalk Empire and Peaky Blinders if you want early 20th century gangsters. And a lot more..."
poldark,"I know it's CW, but I loved Reign (about Mary Queen of Scott's)"
poldark,"There is almost too much television these days but I do love my period dramas. I try to only watch the best ones just because there is so much. Haven't seen Jamestown/Harlots. The Tudor ones have been on my list for awhile. Vikings I liked but stopped somewhere in s3 need to get back to it. Last Kingdom I love. Seen first season of Versailles haven't gotten around to the others yet. The comedy of Norsemen puts me off, worth checking out? Loved Boardwalk Empire, haven't watched much Peaky Blinders though want to. Have you seen Deadwood/The Deuce/Babylon Berlin/The Crown/Pillars of the Earth? Wow so many when you think about it!"
poldark,"Looks interesting, might check it out, thanks :)"
poldark,"If you don’t like the comedy of Norsemen it’s not worth trying again imo, it’s more of the same! I do love the landscapes. Vikings post S3 isn’t at its best tbh...

The Crown I absolutely love. Have you seen Victoria? It’s not as good but it’s entertaining. 

I saw Pillars of the earth and its sequel World without end! 

I’ll check out those other shows you mentioned though. There’s so much TV indeed! I just remembered “Medici”. I watched both seasons a few months ago, it’s great. The production values are quite amazing and Florence is such a beautiful city. There’s a lot of known faces too, like Sean Bean, Richard Madden... speaking of Italian rich families, have you watched the Borgias? Or Borgia."
poldark,"I haven't actually seen any Norsemen, the comedy puts me off watching it but I might check it out. I do prefer serious though.

I agree re Vikings it just went downhill but all my friends love it all the way through so I'll continue on at some point.

Is the sequel to pillars worth watching? Heard it wasn't very good.

Medici I was going to watch but then read it wasn't great, might check it out if you're recommending. I do prefer deciding for myself but with so much these days I tend to rely on aggregate reviews as a filter.

Haven't seen Borgias or Borgia.

What about Mad Men? Technically a period drama, one of the best.

If you want to try something really obscure you might find Heimat interesting. It covers a large period of time in Germany."
poldark,"I don’t remember much from that sequel of Pillars of the Earth actually... so I guess it wasn’t that good lol. I watch a lot of period dramas, great or not tbh. 

Oh I thought Medici was quite good, especially the political intrigues. S2 is better than S1 too. 

I did see Mad Men! Masters of Sexe from relatively the same period was good too. 

Thanks for the German rec. I mostly watch French (since I am French), British and American shows but I’ve found a few great gems from other countries over the years."
poldark,"Haha yeah thats what I heard, if I run out of tv I'll start watching stuff that isn't so good or read some books!

I'll definitely look into Medici.

Masters of Sex I never finished but quite enjoyed it, need to finish that one. Halt and Catch Fire is another one, similar to Mad Men but kind of about the dawn of big tech - highly recommend.

I am from Australia but tend toward non-Australian shows, we don't have that much good stuff produced here imo."

poldark,"A lot of sites have been looking the other way for a long time now when it comes to things that would be deemed unacceptable if reversed for a while now.

Look at Game of Thrones. Lots of outrage over the portrayal rape. Meanwhile we see a male character getting castrated in an extreme way (as part of what are portrayed as months of constant torture) and soon after, we see jokes being made (both by the torturer and his father). Heck there are a lot of jokes made about people who were violently castrated against their will in this series.

Women being violent to their partners is a very common; Paul Rudd getting a completely unproved punch to the face was so 'hilarious' it made the Ant-man trailer and men getting punched or have heavy objects thrown at them has been portrayed as not only acceptable but a humorous response to a falling out for a long time.

I don't buy the ""well women had to deal with this!!!"". So we're living in a society of revenge? Punishing people for the sins of their father? Why are we so eager to live in a world where this thing is an endless swinging pendulum and everyone is constantly full of hate?"

My husband shrieks and runs away when there’s a moth/bee hovering near him, and usually it falls on me to get rid of it, yet not even for a sec I think he’s ‘less of a man’ because of it. His male friends, however, might. The problem is with the patriarchal society and culture we live in and promote. It puts pressure on both men and women. 

And no, it’s not about revenge, it’s as simple as women asking, nay, demanding rights even though they know it will come at heavy price. But hey, they are willing to pay it. Hell, they have been paying it for decades now. If, as a man, you feel you’re being treated unfairly, then by all means, voice it and work towards change. Don’t diss on all the strong women’s efforts just because you have problems with how you’re treated as a man. It’s not a competition. We can all have our rights. It doesn’t have to be one or the other. "

poldark,"“We” didn’t let it go on for centuries. There’s nothing I can do about the behavior of people who died before I was born. 

You are correct in that it is an over-correction. The justification that “well, the other side had to deal with it before” doesn’t justify or make such behavior acceptable. Rather, it shows a level of hypocrisy(which this Beeb presenter is pointing out). People who should know better are purposefully obtuse."
poldark,"I agree, nice statement. I will also add, being a woman, part of it comes from how we go about saying something. I never took a guy saying I looked nice as being wrong. Saying I looked hot, & it coming from a co-worker, boss, or someone I did not know(& I wasn't in a pickup place), wrong, wrong, wrong. Some man or woman ""lusting"" after someone they pretty much have no chance meeting(ie actors) I wouldn't take seriously either, unless they were stalker material.
Doing something is a completely different subject.

It shouldn't be that hard to know, but like I said sometimes a person means well, but it comes off creepy. If you don't know, don't say anything. 

As for the entertainment industry, women were/are supposed to look their best, dress the ""right way"", etc. Even today, there's still actresses who by people on these boards don't look ""good"", or are too old shouldn't be seen on their screens. Seen as objects. But men in general get a pass, because it's all in the acting. Don't get me wrong, I don't think everyone feels that way. And it's not just men. Women will say it about other women, unfortunately. And yes, some women say it about men.  But that mentality about women is still too strong. "
poldark,This is a bunch of horse shit 
poldark,"0.00001% of men went on to become kings doesn't mean men had it better. As a gender men had it worse throughout the history. It's just we don't have enough empathy to care about men's issues. Plus default for men is to suffer so men suffering is nothing new and media doesn't even have to report it cause it's the default but entirely different when it comes to women.

**Both men and women are told to give a damn about women only.**"
poldark,"He's being downvoted because it's a dumb comment for many reasons. ""We"" didn't let anything go on for centuries, we weren't even born yet. 

Many women who are considered attractive are taken seriously as actresses.

In what historical time period did women only work in (relative) safety? 


"
poldark,"Yes folks, there was no discrimination in the old days because the old days was horrible for everyone."
poldark,"If I ever want to oppressed I want it like how women are oppressed by men.

Better education, higher life expectancy, top health care, favorable laws...

What a way to oppress a group."
poldark,"...and those that didn't?

>In August 1914, at the start of the First World War, Admiral Charles Fitzgerald founded the Order of the White Feather with support from the prominent author Mrs Humphrey Ward. The organization aimed to shame men into enlisting in the British army by persuading women to present them with a white feather if they were not wearing a uniform.[2][3]

>This was joined by some prominent feminists and suffragettes of the time, such as Emmeline Pankhurst and her daughter Christabel. They, in addition to handing out the feathers, also lobbied to institute an involuntary universal draft, which included those who lacked votes due to being too young or not owning property.[4][5][6]

>""The Suffragette Movement"" by Sylvia Pankhurst: ""Mrs. Pankhurst toured the country, making recruiting speeches. Her supporters handed the white feather to every young man they encountered wearing civilian dress, and bobbed up at Hyde Park meetings with placards: ""Intern Them All."""
poldark,"Do you even need to ask? Feminists are constantly circle-jilling like this, because they have no actual arguments. You made an excellent point and the useless waste of oxygen could only respond with a smugpost."
poldark,"I'd guess ""wartime"" if you think of it comparatively. Chance of getting bombed at home was much lower than getting killed on the front-lines after being conscripted."
poldark,Being discriminated against is pretty great when it means you don’t have to die in a war.
poldark,Nobody said that.
poldark,"Hmmm, which of your rights would you be willing to give up if there was a draft, currently? "
poldark,"What rights would I have in this situation? I’m being forced against my will to go somewhere I don’t want to be. 

I can’t say whatever I want to my superiors without getting punished, so I don’t have freedom of speech. 

I’m basically a prisoner with the added benefit of having people trying to shoot me."
poldark,"If I have to choose between being a barefoot house husband and dying in a trench, I know what I'm voting for. "
poldark,"You misunderstand, I was asking which rights would you be willing to give up to avoid being drafted. Most of them, by the sound of it? The right to vote, to hold property in your own name, etc?"
poldark,"So in order to avoid serving in the military, you’re willing to give up your voting rights for life, your ability to hold property in your own name and you’re happy to have your salary substantially reduced compared to your coworkers. Got it. "
poldark,"Sure, like I said I would be giving up all my rights if I was drafted anyway, so I might as well not have a bunch of people trying to kill me. "
poldark,"The right to vote for a few years, you mean. I'd take that over dying horrifically alongside my brothers and father in France, which was the case for untold families in WWI. Albeit I'd have to be shamed throughout by those oppressed women as they stuck white feathers on me. "
poldark,"In exchange for not being shot? Yeah, I think that's a decent trade."
poldark,I think I would. Currently the housing market is trash so owning a property isn’t going to happen soon. I personally don’t vote. Salary isn’t even between people anyway. I would like to think I would rather make do with what I have and be happy rather than forced into someone else’s war. 
poldark,"To be comparable, however,  to be excluded from the draft, you’d give up those rights for life, not just a few years. "
poldark,"No, the right to vote or hold property in your own name for your whole life.  "
poldark,"I suppose it’s worth noting that serving in the military doesn’t offer an *absolute* guarantee of being shot. 
"
poldark,"Women had the vote by 1920s and men still have to sign up for military to get the voting right, state jobs, financial aids and scholarships. Women had all the rights without having to agree to die in a war on top of that women went on to mock war veterans and men who didn't want to go to war. It's called white feather campaign.

How we trade places? I want the extra 5 or 6 years that comes with being a woman."
poldark,The eras where men were enlisted but women weren't includes WWI - and in that era women weren't long denied the vote. I'd certainly opt for that over likely dying a miserable death.
poldark,"Sure, but it's likely. About ten million people died, I'm not taking that risk just to get voting rights and higher wages. And I'd rather take care of children than work in an early 20th century, pre-unions factory. "
poldark,In the 19th Century you had about a 5% chance of death in childbirth. Good luck!
poldark,"Sure, but women have longer lifespans in general, and the charts I'm looking at suggest they pull ahead thanks to that in terms of life expectancy."
poldark,"Your point being?

This is about things you are willing to exchange for your basic rights. 

Or are you suggesting that you’re being oppressed by your chromosomes. The only reason I bought up childbirth, by the way was that you specifically said you were happy to look after the kids. "
poldark,"You brought up a biological factor that shortens lifespan, women having naturally longer lifespans is entirely relevant. "
poldark,"And in the past it seems that wonen’s life expectancy wasn’t *substantially* longer than men’s. The current trend for women living significantly longer is a recent addition, with complex reasons https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/why-is-life-expectancy-lo/

How does this relate to the historical oppression of women?"
poldark,"I bought it up because you said you would opt for childcare and by extension childbirth rather than join the armed forces. 

Anyway, I don’t think that we are going to agree that the fact that women didn’t fight in the armed forces somehow balances out their status as voteless chatels of their men folk. "
poldark,"You were the one who brought up childbirth risks, it's your segue. "
poldark,"The ""somehow"" makes it seem like you don't see the reasoning of why someone would make substantial sacrifices in order to avoid being dragged into a war. And it's not just war, although that's a big part. Working conditions were absolutely horrendous, being a housewife sounds infinitely preferable to working in a late 19th century factory, or a coal mine, or anything along those lines."
Stranger Things,Imagine your industry being so shit that Twitch is the less toxic environment.
Stranger Things,"Grace Van Dien:
>“Here’s the thing, I have seen that some people are upset with me for turning down acting projects and deciding to stream more, but the fact of the matter is the last few projects I’ve worked on I didn’t have the best experiences with some of the people I had to work for,” Van Dien said.

>She then alleged that a film producer made unwanted sexual advances toward her on set.

>“One of the last movies I did, one of the producers asked me to… like, he hired a girl that he was sleeping with and then he had her ask me to have a threesome with them,” Van Dien said. “So… that’s my boss. And then I didn’t and I cried and I was so upset. But when people are like, ‘How is streaming better for your mental health?’ That’s how. I get to stay inside my house and play video games and I don’t have my boss asking me to have sex with them.”

>Van Dien added that though she’s sticking to streaming for now, she hopes to get back into show business soon — and on her own terms.

>“I’m happy here, and I’m developing my own projects,” she said. “I’m hoping that someone decides to fund them because then I can be in control of my own set, and I’m not gonna ask my actors to sleep with me.”"
Stranger Things,That’s fucked but at least she’s still able to do something lucrative and didn’t have to throw it all away to avoid being Weinsteined
Stranger Things,Scumbags are getting too comfortable again as time passes the Weinstein stuff. Time to nip that shit in the bud.
Stranger Things,who was she on stranger things?
Stranger Things,"This person clearly forgot that her father is Johnny f'n Rico. 

So frustrating to hear things like this. Like the money you get from existing in the producer-tier of the film industry isn't enough? You also have to torment your talent?"
Stranger Things,Hollywood is full of some really dark shit and it’s getting really hard to see past it.
Stranger Things,"I may be naive, but her dad is Casper Van Dien. I would think having a fairly famous dad would be the best kind of nepotism: insulation against those dirty fucking movie execs."
Stranger Things,She should name the projects and producers.
Stranger Things,"She'd rather stream on Twitch playing games than work in Hollywood. And I say good for her, her health and safety are more important. Fuck Hollywood and the sexual predator scum that run the industry"
Stranger Things,"Was so mesmerizing in the few scenes she had in ST, such a shame there are so many shitty people who take advantage of nice people like Grace.

Edit for all of the people arguing about this in the comments: I took her task to be difficult because she only had one episode to make the audience feel sympathy and care for her enough to be the whole impetus of the season, basically.  And I think she did a great job with it."
Stranger Things,"Good for her! Honestly though it's so fucking sickening and at the same time unsurprising that there was a whole cultural moment a few years ago about exactly this sort of behavior and yet there's still just so much rot. Hollywood is morally bankrupt, and I don't blame any young women for not wanting to associate with that cesspool."
Stranger Things,Good for her.
Stranger Things,That fucking sucks nobody deserves to go through that. I’m happy she has streaming as something that she does. Don’t usually give two shits about famous ppl or celebs but that’s just Down right shitty. Do your thing young lady and fuck these Hollywierd ppl and their horrible practices! Hopefully somebody does fund one of her projects bc she sounds like somebody who has a future in helping make sure her cast and crew are safe and protected!
Stranger Things,It's totally bullshit that with film unions and guilds that Producers can keep their job after such disgusting behavior.
Stranger Things,">“One of the last movies I did, one of the producers asked me to… like, he hired a girl that he was sleeping with and then he had her ask me to have a threesome with them,” Van Dien said. “So… that’s my boss.

Stranger Things,"Chrissy wake up!

On a serious note, good for her by not compromising her morals to advance her career."
Stranger Things,NPR just did a story about how conditions in the entertainment industry are basically back to pre me too. Large companies hired experts to help them change but just used them as shields whenever concerns were raised. All outward change was purely performative.
Stranger Things,Chrissy woke up!!!
Stranger Things,"I gotta say, for one of the most unioned up industries in this country, they do fucking fuck all when shit like this comes up."
Stranger Things,"Harvey Weinstein was just the tip, the whole industry is fucked"
Stranger Things,So in other words nothing has changed at all?!
Stranger Things,That’s awful. Hopefully she can find some projects without any sex pests. I was impressed with her on Stranger Things. She really elevated what could have been a typical mean-girl cheerleader tropey character.
Stranger Things,"On another note, it just hit me that her dad is Johnny Rico from Starship Troopers, Casper Van Dien. My mind is blown that he has a 26 y/o daughter, but it makes sense."
Stranger Things,I wish some of these women would be more Ellen Barkin-like and say names when they talk of these things.
Stranger Things,Good that she knows her worth and kudos to her for sharing what happened
Stranger Things,What is it with Hollywood and the total inability to not be a creep?
Stranger Things,Wow that sucks. But at least she can get some joy out of streaming
Stranger Things,Out that boss - hollywood still full of assholish men treating women like shit.
Stranger Things,Stranger things star? She was in like one episode
Stranger Things,"No relation to Casper van Dien, is there?"
Stranger Things,“Star” is used pretty loosely these days eh
Stranger Things,Her twitch handle is BlueFille. I couldn't find it in the article.
Stranger Things,"More power too her. She’s doing her part!

She was good in Stranger Things, her role was small but complex and her performance was memorable. I’ll miss seeing more from her but she doesn’t owe us her talent. She owes herself her happiness."
Stranger Things,"I love that she not only didn't cave to the pressure, but called it out. She can't name the man because he'll bury her financially in litigation, but she can make it known that she's experienced what we all know the industry does and that other women don't have to accept it either."
Stranger Things,"I don't want to in any way downplay the inappropriate sexual situations she was exposed to, but this article really exaggerated and overplayed her role in Stranger Things.  She was in part of one episode... Not exactly ""the breakout star"" they claimed

Jazzing up the story is not how journalism is done"
Stranger Things,What’s sad is after everything the last few years these abusers in Hollywood can still get away with it and keep doing this awful shit to more people. I’d like to think we live in a world where they can’t hide anymore. I wish she could name this person but I get why she can’t. I feel for her.
Stranger Things,Didnt know she was Johnny Rico's daughter.
Stranger Things,Had no idea this was Casper Van Dien's kid.
Stranger Things,"Understandable, have a great day"
Stranger Things,It’s horrible that so many industries are operated this way and not enough people put their foot down and expose it.
Stranger Things,Johnny Rico doesn't like this
Stranger Things,Why can’t people just go to work and do their job instead of trying to sleep with people / sexually harass or assault those they work with?
Stranger Things,name names. burn that cesspool to the ground
Stranger Things,Y’all should watch the movie “she said” came out late last year and is about Harvey Weinstein and that New York Times article. Really begs the question of how many other Harveys are out there?
Stranger Things,"I feel so bad for her. She's been bullied by people who are obsessed with Joseph Quinn (Eddie from Stranger Things) too, because they are friends.

I hope things look up for her."
Stranger Things,"Amuzing people are still dubious of potential repercussions if she spoke out more, considering the trash she's already getting in this cesspool of a thread, entirely from people with no stakes in the matter."
Stranger Things,"She was only in 3 episodes, how is she a “star”?"
Stranger Things,Name them!
Stranger Things,"Stranger Things *Star*? I watched it and don’t even remember her character, let alone know who she is."

Stranger Things,"I didn't know she streamed and I thought I'd check it out, but she has no archived past broadcasts or anything at all eh?"
Stranger Things,It is unfortunate when an industry becomes known for having a toxic environment. It is important for all industries to prioritize creating safe and respectful spaces for everyone.
Stranger Things,"Waiting for the usual suspects to attack and vilify her for daring to speak out against an abusive man, the way they have for other women over the last four years. Claiming it was their fault they were abused, or that they were the ones abusing the men."
Stranger Things,Hollywood never cleaned up after Harvey obv
Stranger Things,"One horrible takeaway from all of this is that too much of this comes down to “talent”. 

The producers with “talent” get away with this shit behavior while the many victims have to hope they’re “talented” enough to be heard. 

Super mature move out of her to acknowledge how toxic that is instead of suffering."

Stranger Things,hows this still happening after weinstein?
Stranger Things,"I always find it interesting when people in America express such sexually liberal views, and then something like this comes up people act as though the employee and worker relationship is somehow sacred. 

She is an attractive and semi-notable young actress, who must receive attention from many men, especially as a streamer. Is the only reason for this being news and outrage-worthy the fact that her boss tried to get his way with her? 

Perhaps it’s the power dynamic people find offensive. They picture a helpless and naive young woman, and a strong older man who aims to take advantage of her. However, the woman in question is well of age, so is this really anybody’s business other than her own?

Surely we wouldn’t mean to patronize the young woman, who is obviously more than capable of rejecting someone’s advances on her own, without the aid and outrage of the thoughtful Reddit community."

Stranger Things,Ah... to be a woman. And they say rape culture doesn't exist
Stranger Things,"Imagine thinking that after Weinstein … you of all people can somehow get away with it …

Good for her honestly. She’s making money and she doesn’t even have to leave her house. She literally stays home, plays video games, and gets paid. If you’re mad you’re just jealous because she’s living the dream."
Stranger Things,I like how people can do this and have no repercussions because people around them aren't willing to expose the truth on how bad they are. I get not wanting to as a victim because of how much harassment they get but it's annoying how many people stay silent when they see their boss being an absolute creep. This shit just causes a cycle of harassment because obviously the sexual advances aren't going to stop because they're not punished for their crimes.
Stranger Things,So when are the women in this field going to be smart enough to carry some sort of recording device with them so that when these shit producers do this then there is some sort of evidence against them?
Stranger Things,And people wonder why celebrities keep their kids hidden from the public
Stranger Things,"Hey, guys, we get it, you think the word ""star"" is misapplied. Glad you're all so focused on what's important."

We should watch in the future to see if she files a lawsuit for sexual harassment. It’s arguable she’s laying the groundwork for damages (loss of income from psyche basis).

Hypothetically, if she does file suit and prevails, she may get paid for said contracts of films. 

While underhanded, who gives a shit. The industry should not allow this type of crap to happen, they let fucking that sexual predator Weinstein do what he wanted for 20+ years without consequence.

Alvinnn!!! And the Chipmunks,yes she was
Alvinnn!!! And the Chipmunks,A billion Stanley nickels.
Alvinnn!!! And the Chipmunks,Ciaràn Hinds is brilliant.
Alvinnn!!! And the Chipmunks,"Ciaran Hinds dies in everything I've seen him in, so I don't expect his character here to have a high chance of survival."
Alvinnn!!! And the Chipmunks,Mance Rayder!
Alvinnn!!! And the Chipmunks,Is Rory Kinnear gonna give birth to himself from his Rory Kinussy like in Men cuz if so i need to binge s1 fast.
Alvinnn!!! And the Chipmunks,Can they add an interesting story?
Alvinnn!!! And the Chipmunks,actors i've heard of? in the highest budget show ever made? CRAZY
Alvinnn!!! And the Chipmunks,"The first season was so boring and in many cases kind of stupid. Why was the dark lord on a life raft, he just coincidently met up with Galadriel? She just jumped off a ship and decided to swim across the ocean? The elf and the dwarf spent the entire season discussing what good friends they are. The volcano erupted, covered everyone in burning ash but everyone is okay. The army from Nimonea or wherever just happened to show up at a little village at the exact moment necessary with no pretext or reason. It was just stupid moment after stupid moment staring wooden 1 dimensional characters.

I wanted to like it, particularly with all the back lash regarding black elves, but man was it boring and dumb.

I wanted to add a bit of stupidity. The part time black smith enthusiast (turned out to be the lord of darkness or whatever) giving black smithing advice to the greatest black smith of all time, who has been doing it for thousands of years, and the black smith taking the advice, and being like ‘oh yeah, never thought of that’, wtf."
Alvinnn!!! And the Chipmunks,What role is George Constanza gonna be playing??
Alvinnn!!! And the Chipmunks,"Biggest letdown I've ever seen on television. Every single scene and dialogue seems so fake and cringe. Unbelievable they didn't just copy paste the style from the movies, and they could have done pretty much anything story-wise. But when everything looks like plastic it has a long way."
Alvinnn!!! And the Chipmunks,"I am a die-hard LotR fan, and I have read most of Tolkien's extended works, including the Silmarillion and The History of Middle-Earth. Love the films as well.


I thought Rings of Power was barely watchable. Terrible pacing, forgettable characters, and a wandering story that wasn't interesting in the least. The cinematography was gorgeous, and I liked the cast, but wow was the entire series a complete letdown for me.


I know that there is some conflict around the rights to Tolkien's original story, which I think is why the RoP went ""off-book."""
Alvinnn!!! And the Chipmunks,"The show lost me when they went from boat, to full gallop, to battle, to victory all in the span of timecode that was no longer than 10 minutes.  I felt abused by a show I thought was pretty great up until then.  I'm not even sure they CAN win back my viewership when they set up an entire story/season which is working up to something then blow straight through it."
Alvinnn!!! And the Chipmunks,Haven't seen Rory in anything since his fateful Black Mirror episode. 🐷
Alvinnn!!! And the Chipmunks,"they should ditch the showrunners as they did with picard season 3, but I don't think the show is redeemable"
Alvinnn!!! And the Chipmunks,"bets are open about which one of those will play an asshole character, and which will play a good, strong, empowered and determined one"
Alvinnn!!! And the Chipmunks,Black Mirror ruined Rory Kinnear for me.
Alvinnn!!! And the Chipmunks,Mance!
Alvinnn!!! And the Chipmunks,Why is everyone suddenly spelling Ciar**á**n Hinds's name with the fada the wrong way around
Alvinnn!!! And the Chipmunks,This fan fiction will never be cannon in my eyes. This show was born out of Jeff Bezos lust for money and fame and the writers have an obvious hatred towards Tolkien’s vision. Fuck this show.
Alvinnn!!! And the Chipmunks,Is anyone even looking forward this mess of a show anymore?
Alvinnn!!! And the Chipmunks,Can they add some new writers?
Alvinnn!!! And the Chipmunks,Nah I’m done with this show. No way I come back for season 2
Alvinnn!!! And the Chipmunks,"""You killed a Consul of Mordor!"" - Ciaran, probably"
Alvinnn!!! And the Chipmunks,"I found the first season pretty unwatchable, got about halfway through before bailing.  It was too hard to suspend disbelief and I found many of the characters uninspiring; the mediocre writing as well left a lot to be desired.   
To those that stuck with it...best of luck with Season 2!"
Alvinnn!!! And the Chipmunks,"Maybe they'll be cast as Doromir and Agathirn in a party of harfoots and the wizard Brindorf to destroy a magical item in ~~The Southlands~~ Mordor.

Jesus Christ this show was a disappointment all throughout but especially at the end of Season 1. Capped by those cringeworthy fan service lines from The Stranger. What a complete and total waste of effort and resources."
Alvinnn!!! And the Chipmunks,How wasn't this cancelled
Alvinnn!!! And the Chipmunks,Just cancel it already
Alvinnn!!! And the Chipmunks,*Worst fucking deal I’ve ever made.*
Alvinnn!!! And the Chipmunks,I’m most curious how long Amazon is going to persist with this farce to save face.
Alvinnn!!! And the Chipmunks,how'd this trash get a second session?
Alvinnn!!! And the Chipmunks,The bald man is so handsome I fell in love with him when he appeared in penny dreadful.
Alvinnn!!! And the Chipmunks,i really hope tanya moody's buds call her 'madeye' or it's all a waste
Alvinnn!!! And the Chipmunks,"Whoa, I don't know Rory Kinnear, but I love his dad in all the Beatles movies"
Alvinnn!!! And the Chipmunks,Did they add new writers
Alvinnn!!! And the Chipmunks,"Nice, now replace the showrunners."
Alvinnn!!! And the Chipmunks,That show is dead.
Alvinnn!!! And the Chipmunks,Not even Ciaran Hinds will be able to save this show from itself.
Alvinnn!!! And the Chipmunks,Good actors but no thank you.
Alvinnn!!! And the Chipmunks,Sooo is aragorn a black woman now
Alvinnn!!! And the Chipmunks,I'm still not going to watch it.  Season 1 was a bitter disappointment.
Alvinnn!!! And the Chipmunks,Has anyone prepared Tanya for the “black”-lash to come? At this point it’s like predicting the weather…
Alvinnn!!! And the Chipmunks,"Have they got new show runners and/or writers?

If not it doesn't matter how good actors/actresses they get, you can only polish a turd so much."
Alvinnn!!! And the Chipmunks,"Not interested at all. The first season wasn't good. The only thing I liked was the practical makeup/prosthetics for the orcs.

Everything else was just bland high fantasy garbage."
Alvinnn!!! And the Chipmunks,"I will at least try season two but my hopes are low, the show is not horrible but it's definitely not good, it barely scratches mediocre for me. Some of the casting, the pacing, the writing, all of it could've been done so much better but I have my doubts these showrunners have the ability to pull it around, we'll see."
Alvinnn!!! And the Chipmunks,Bruh who is still funding this dumpster fire?
Alvinnn!!! And the Chipmunks,I was so excited and also very hesitant to watch this lotr adaptation. I got through an episode and a half before realizing it really doesn’t exist in the lotr universe and was more for like little kids. Really disappointed hopefully PJ comes back one day
Alvinnn!!! And the Chipmunks,Whattttttt?  Mance Rayder is joining LOTR?
Alvinnn!!! And the Chipmunks,Rory Kinnear should appear in more shows/movies
Alvinnn!!! And the Chipmunks,We're still getting a season 2 after the crap that season 1 was? ok then.
Alvinnn!!! And the Chipmunks,That's nice. Now what will they do to add viewers?
Alvinnn!!! And the Chipmunks,"Why was Sauron on a raft? Was he waiting for Galadriel?  Was it a happy accident? Where was he going? His entire backstory and all of his motivations are blown to bits the second that his identity is revealed so what were his motivations for the first 90% of the season? Was he just baiting Galadriel? Why was he on a raft?? WHY WAS HE OUT THERE? Was he leaving??? Did he somehow know she jumped out of a boat and he just set up the entire thing to run into her??

Also, why are the heroes being duplicitous? This is a universe where they (in the show!) establish that there is objective morality and the ends do not justify the means under any circumstance but everyone is acting like they're Game of Thrones characters trying to trick each other and hide their true motives even when it doesn't really serve them or their goals. The actions of the heroes are indistinguishable from the villains. Is the message that even in a binary ""good and evil"" world, there's not actually any good?

Why was he in the middle of the ocean??? What was he doing out there? Why did he go there? Why does he allow himself to be put in jail? Was that intentional? Why was his plan so dependent on other people acting in a very specific way? Can he predict the future? Can he bend them to his will already? If so, why the theatrics and convoluted series of events? WHY IS HE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE OCEAN?? It's almost like the show runners are dumb people who perceive ""smart"" as being complicated with a bunch of steps because they don't see anything else because they can't abstract the motivations of smart people because it's so foreign to them so they just thing it's them plotting out seemingly random things like they can predict the future. Surely that's not the case because there's no way this would be handed off to complete morons right?

Is the simple answer, ""~~because the writers are dumb~~?""

It can't be that! They paid a billion dollars. Why was he out there? Why are the elves dumb? Why are there old elves? Why the fuck are the elves so ugly? Why do they trudge through the snow?? They don't leave tracks in the snow. Why are they sinking into it??? Why is everyone not bowing to/falling in love with Galadriel? Why are the other elves not terrified of her? Why do none of them call her ""aunt"" or ""cousin""? Where is her husband? Did they make her single because they wanted a romantic temptation with the living personification of evil? Is she dumb because she's horny? That seems sexist. Can they not write a woman character without having some of her actions informed by temptation so they made her single? Are they that shallow? Do they think that little of their audience?

WHY IS HE ON A RAFT IN THE OCEAN FOR NO REASON AND WHY DOES ANYTHING ELSE HE DOES MAKE SENSE? WHAT WAS THE PURPOSE OF ALL OF THAT?"
Alvinnn!!! And the Chipmunks,"Amazon employees are having a field day by commenting positively about this dumpster fire I see.

Its a ok serie when you don't compare it to the movies."
Alvinnn!!! And the Chipmunks,"This will have what to do with Tolkien, again?"
Alvinnn!!! And the Chipmunks,"Rory Kinnear is the most underrated actor in Hollywood. If you want a masterclass in acting, watch Penny Dreadful."
Alvinnn!!! And the Chipmunks,I'm torn between never wanting to see or hear about RoP again and keep watching just to poke fun of it.
Alvinnn!!! And the Chipmunks,"This show isn't as terrible as I thought it would be, definitely delivered far short of it's potential with some daft writing but it also had some genuinely good elements to it (Elrond and Durin were the strong point for me, they were fun to watch and I loved the atmosphere)

There were too many plots going at the one time and the show would constantly take the foot off the accelator when one plot started getting interesting and cut to another plot to spend 20 mins watching less interesting characters deliver dull monologues.  Constantly killing momentum at the exact moment something is about to happen, made the episodes feel like they were padding them out and were afraid to stay with a climatic moment for too long.

I'll give season two a chance, there's just enough there for me to come back to, but if they repeat the same mistakes then I'll probably bail at that point."
Alvinnn!!! And the Chipmunks,But why? Did they already pay for the second season or something? Nobody's gonna suffer through another one.
Alvinnn!!! And the Chipmunks,"I find the hate this show gets really weird.

Ciaràn and Rory are great additions though. I haven't really seen anything Tanya Moodie has done"
Alvinnn!!! And the Chipmunks,So the flop continues....
Alvinnn!!! And the Chipmunks,That guy in the middle looks like the host of hot ones
Alvinnn!!! And the Chipmunks,Are they hiring better writers?
Alvinnn!!! And the Chipmunks,"Another steaming pile of money, I have zero faith in this."
Word Party,"Wow, even by Game of Thrones standards, this show is dark and mature as fuck.﻿"
Word Party,Just don't get a Smart TV. A laptop or even a dinky little netbook + an HDMI cable will get you all of the same functionality on standard HD TV's.
Word Party,Jesus Christ.  Is this real?
Word Party,I feel like this should be getting more attention. 
Word Party,"I don't get it. It uses voice recognition that is communicated to be translated. How is this different than Siri or Google Now? Why is everyone freaking out about this one? Yeah, it's a useless feature, but I don't get why this is big brother and Siri is not. "
Word Party,"You hit a button which activates voice recognition and whatever you say during that time is sent to whoever, your TV isn't always listening to you, if you are worried about hitting the button on accident and happen to yell out your credit card number or the fact that you fucked your cousin 20 years ago in a closet remember your phone also has a microphone on it, your car probably does also, tablet, laptop all of which (probably) have to be activated to function first just like the voice recognition feature and it even displays a microphone icon on the screen when it is active (it can also be disabled entirely)"
Word Party,"Is this true, or a joke?"
Word Party,Why on Earth is a television sending voice recognition data anywhere? If you can't do it without revealing private info to third parties than why are you doing it?
Word Party,"People clearly don't care anymore. Google, Apple, the fucking NSA, Facebook.  After all we've learned about the loss of privacy, and people just don't care.

Imagine, your having a private conversation with your SO, negotiating some new sexual thing you might like to try, in the background the commercial break during ""Person of Interest"" is  *""Introducing the Annihilator! - America's hottest new butt plug""*, next *""Elbow Grease personal lubricant, get your free sample now!""* and *""Preparation H, You'll need this tomorrow!""*"
Word Party,and also cheap devices like the amazon fire tv/stick
Word Party,Picture tube TV and a DVD/VHS player for the win.
Word Party,Chromecast is all you need. 
Word Party,Can't really control a laptop with a tv remote. A Roku will serve you better. 
Word Party,Yep. I think you can disable the voice control... but still.
Word Party,Wireless keyboard with a touchpad works surprisingly well.
Word Party,Samsung needs to get a huge amount of backlash for this.  Companies can't try to get away with that shit. 
Word Party,"""you can turn it off?"" - 1984"
Word Party,Yes voice control can be disabled. 
Word Party,What do you think all your other voice controlled shit is doing? Xbone? Your phone? 
Word Party,I still wouldn't trust it.
Word Party,"Xbox is not recording voices to sell.  Neither is Cortana, or Siri."
Word Party,"I think you missed the most straight-forward reason - he's appeasing Walt, who is incredibly important to his operation at this point. If you watch the scene again, Gus tells Jesse that Walt came to him and told him about Jesse's plans. Walt is even sitting on the same side of the table as Gus is. 

If Gus had his way, Jesse would likely have been taken care of already and Gail would be in the lab with Walt. But he knows that Walt likely wouldn't agree to keep cooking if he did that so he intervenes and gives Jesse a chance to avoid that fate. He similarly lets Walt keep living at the end of S4 when Jesse has turned to his side for the same reason - he can't risk having no one to cook his product.

I'd also add that while Gus is cold and calculating, he isn't always disciplined. He goes to confront Lalo himself in BCS and Hector as well. He doesn't seem to hide himself from lower level peons like Nacho and Arturo in that show either."
Word Party,"During the meeting Gus says to Jesse 'These men are my trusted employees', and I've think I've always just taken that at face value? I also assumed the dealers probably would've kept their mouths shut about Gus' identity if they were ever arrested, much like Mike's 11 (12?) guys, who were all being compensated for not cooperating with APD/DEA and were at least implicitly aware of the Pollos Hermanos connection. Whether or not Tomas' dealers were on the same level or had ever met Gus prior to that meeting, who knows.

My interpretation is that by revealing to Jesse that Walt had essentially taken Gus' side, Gus would discourage him from trying to take out the 2 dealers or escalate things further. A part of Gus probably expected Jesse to do what he did and be killed in the process but, like you said, he didn't expect or account for Walt's intervention at all.

EDIT: Nacho was also a very special case, Gus needed someone else to be blamed for Lalo and a concrete way to cement that blame; or for Nacho to go away and not him point the finger pointed at Gus. With his own dealers, no one would have batted an eye if he ordered Victor or Gus to dispose of them quietly."
Word Party,I like these discussions.
Word Party,"I feel like Nacho and Arturo are like the Victor and Tyrus of the Salamanca operation, they deal with supplying and and getting money from the low level dealers, and just general management of street related things. They also report directly to Hector, and Gus has to hide his involvement in Arturo's murder and pin it on another faction.

Great point about Walter. I suspect Gus had always planned to be rid of him due to Hank, but at that time Walt would need to stick around for awhile, so its absolutely in Gus's best interest to appease Walt in regards to Jesse, bonus points for stroking Walt's ego by telling Jesse how much respect he has for him. I still feel like Gus was betting on Jesse being killed in a conflict with the dealers. He gets what he wants and still has Walt, which is almost what happened if not for Walt's intervention.

In season 4, Gus really doesn't have a circumstance like this to have Walter killed, but he does still get as close as he can. He pretty boldly threatens Walt in the desert, which would have worked out had Walt had the funds to pay the vacuum man."
Word Party,"I can accept that the two dealers in this episode were never properly characterized as important enough to be Gus-worthy or at the same level as Nacho, Arturo, Victor, or Tyrus. But I still think the scene makes sense overall because Gus is putting on a show for Walt."
Word Party,"I agree, Gus knew exactly how to play Walt. Him telling Walt that he that he should still provide for his family because he is a man and that's what men do just to get him to cook also comes to mind. He sort of attempts the same with Mike with his comment about Justice, and how he understands revenge.

Also this is awkward, but I had just edited my original reply to you as I was kind of in a rush when I wrote it and I decided in didn't really make much sense, but then I refreshed when I was done and saw you had already replied, but I hope I was able to convey a little better what exactly I was trying to say."
Word Party,What was it like climbing up the cartoon network ladder?
Word Party,"Hey everybody! Thanks for coming, let's see how many questions we can get to. Hmmm hmm hmm!!!!"
Word Party,"Hi JG I know it's not special but I was watching Regular Show since the first episode and I never miss an episode of it, anyway my question is 
 What's your favorite episode you made on regular show?"
Word Party,"Hello! First off - thank you for creating Regular Show! I never thought I'll love a cartoon tv-series (being a full-grown adult, lol). Anyway, my question is kinda obvious - the first announcement of Close Enough happened a couple of years ago and then there was silence for a long time. Why did it take so long for Close Enough to be released?"
Word Party,"I've gotta know, will there ever be a Regular Show blu ray box set?"
Word Party,"Hi JG, cheers for doing this AMA. As a film student, I'd like to ask how you plan/go through the writing process when it comes to either making an episode or even a whole show? Is there months or potentially years of planning? Cheers for doing this mate"
Word Party,"Dude I’ve been counting down the days for Close Enough! I stayed up late last night so I could watch a couple of episodes as soon as they dropped. I’m really happy the show found a home on HBOMax. 

Is there anything specific that you’re excited for fans to see on Close Enough? Also, it’s been fun spotting the regular show Easter eggs!"
Word Party,"Thank you for creating such an awesome show I enjoyed in my stoned youth and stoned today! One of my favorite parts of Regular Show was the fact that skips was voiced by Mark Hamill.

Did you develop the character of skips before coordinating with Mark, or did you create skips with Mark in mind?"
Word Party,Hi JG I love your work so much! My question is was it an easy or hard transition from making a show like Regular show then making Close enough?
Word Party,"I just wanted to let you know how much regular show meant to me while growing up, the show shaped my understanding of life and till this day still influences me and my friends. Thank you for creating such a wonderful show."
Word Party,Join us on Twitter tonight at 7pm PST/10pm EST to watch the entire first episode of Close Enough! Use #CloseEnoughMAX to tell us what you're most excited about. You can tune into the Watch Party here: https://twitter.com/i/events/1277946836695699456
Word Party,"Hello JG! I’m so excited to ask you this question. To preface, I am from your hometown and absolutely love Regular Show and the fact that you’re from here. 

My question is how much did/does Hanford play as inspiration for your writing/characters/setting? Are there any specific similarities you’d like to share?

Thank you for making me laugh all these years and for making Hanford a little cooler :)"
Word Party,"we HAVE to know - what's in a mordoshake? mordecai almost made his famous mordoshakes for everyone in ""bad kiss,"" but he never got the chance, and we were all left wondering!"
Word Party,"Im guessing you've done psychedelics in the past, according to the regular show ""2 am in the pm"" episode on youtube which we all know and love. does that type of thing still interest you and does it have any impact on your work now?"
Word Party,"I just want to say thank you. Regular Show means so much to me and my family. I’m still wrecked from the finale but it was perfect. Good show! 

Looking forward to Close Enough!!"
Word Party,Heyo! I binged the whole first season of Close Enough last night and LOVED IT! My question: I heard originally the series was going to be 22 mins per-episode but was changed to 11 during production. What caused this change and did it bring about any unexpected challenges?
Word Party,How do you just exude so much coolness my dude?
Word Party,"I feel like someone HAS to ask this at some point: *What happened?* How did the development hell begin, and how did you finally manage to escape it?  


Also, do you have a personal favorite episode out of season one? Mine was definitely the Logan's Run episode."
Word Party,"Hi JG Qunitel love your stuff. Just binged the entirety of Close Enough season one and it was a blast to watch. My question is, are we still getting Holiday Specials considering the show is dropped on a streaming platform all at once?"
Word Party,"Thanks for the AMA! I just started watching Regular Show for the first time and I'm really loving it

Where did Mordecai and Rigby get their names from?"
Word Party,"Hey JG! Big fan of regular show, one of the best cartoon shows ever! 
I must ask, when did you get the idea to become an animator? 
I don’t know if you have already answered because I’m taking the chance to ask before the comments get too full!"
Word Party,"Hello JG! I was most curious to know what the process of writing animation is when it comes to the storyboard sessions. 

Since you’re a voice actor in both shows, could you describe what it’s like when presenting scenes during production meetings? Do you act them out as you would in a recording booth?"
Word Party,"Hello JG,
I watched a lot of regular show growing up and i was wondering, how did you pitch your show to Cartoon Network? I want to get into the animation business myself and maybe pitch a show of my own. Any advice?"
Word Party,"Hello JG, do you play video games? If so what are some of your favorites"
Word Party,"Hi JG I'm Alice. Let me just say I'm a fan of your work man. I watched Regular Show when I was younger and it really inspired me to become an artist. I'm going back to college for Animation and Story boarding rn, but can't wait to get out there. I wanted to ask. On Regular Show, how did you guys get away with using all that awesome music on the show? Also, do you guys ever plan on doing a proper Regular Show crossover episode with Close Enough in the future? (Also Margaret, Skips and Benson are my favorite characters)."
Word Party,[deleted]
Word Party,Hey JG what is your favorite game on the Sega Master System?
Word Party,Have you enjoyed working more on Close Enough than you did with Regular Show?
Word Party,how can I get a close enough merch box?? looked so cool!
Word Party,"Hi JG, I’m a big fan of your work and Regular Show really molded my sense of humor as a kid (which is great because now people think I’m funny), and I’ve been looking forward to watching Close Enough for a few years now. Which brings me to my question: is there any chance of Close Enough coming to Blu-Ray or DVD in the future? Money is kind of tight and I don’t think I can really add another streaming service to my bills, so a one time purchase of the first season would be a lot easier for me personally. And thank you for doing this AMA with us!"
Word Party,"That intro, I’m diggin it. The synth reminds me of [Thrice](https://youtu.be/xu_MSd2y30c) and something else I can’t put my finger on. Who wrote it cause I can’t find anything in the credits? 

Thanks for always hooking up them deep synth jams

Edit: also [The Decembrists](https://youtu.be/ksTFj6L0mao) intro ❤️"
Word Party,"Holy crap, you worked on the animated fever dream that was *The Marvelous Misadventures of Flapjack*. The episode about K'Nuckles' candy addiction and resulting psychological, moral, and physical deterioration was absolutely crazy, and to this day amazes me for how far it went. How on earth did you guys get that kind of material aired at a TV-Y7 rating?"
Word Party,"Hi JG, thank you for doing this AMA with us! I’d like to ask, did you have a lot of nerves when you first started writing and creating shows? And do you still get that same feeling with Close Enough now?"
Word Party,I just wanted to say hi jg
Word Party,"Hey JG, first off I just want to say, my first experience with your work was at this little film festival my mom dragged me to. There was this crazy one called ""2 in the AM PM"", and it was the only thing in that whole boring festival my 13 year old brain could latch onto. I didn't put 2 and 2 together for awhile even after being an early fan of Regular Show. That's all to say, you make some worthwhile stuff dude.

Second and last, do you have any advice for someone trying to break into the industry out of college at the moment? I imagine it must be hell for everyone inside the industry too, but if you can spare any advice or a well-worded epitaph for any future career prospects, it'd be much appreciated. 

Thanks for all you guys do putting your vibe and creativity out into the world man."
Word Party,"Hey JG. You worked on Flapjack at one point with Pendleton Ward, Alex Hirsch, and Patrick McHale (according to Wikipedia at least). How was that experience working with them? You all went off to create your own amazing and unique shows— could you have predicted the style and type of show they would make just from their personalities when working with them? Love you man and looking forward to Close Enough!"
Word Party,"Hi JG, do you feel that you had way more creative freedom with Close Enough than with Regular Show, since one was more teen-oriented?"
Word Party,[deleted]
Word Party,What do you like to do outside of the television industry?
Word Party,"Nice to see you here on Reddit, huge fan of both shows! I have a few questions:

1. I have a theory that Regular Show is a video game/simulation created by Josh. What do you think of this? It would explain the existence of ""Clap Like This"" in that universe and other very video-game-like events occurring in the show. He got the inspiration for the setting from everywhere he's been and all the crazy shit that's gone down in his life, which brings me to my next point:
2. Was Josh the guy in ""2 in the AM PM""? It would explain why Mordecai and Benson exist in the Regular Show universe.
3. When's season 2 coming out? I woke up at 4 am to watch the entire thing before work. I crave more of this show.

P.S: Can we expect Rush in this show or is it still out of the question?

P.P.S: This is a bit random, but do you or anyone else possess a full recording of Party Tonight? I think everyone would love to see that!"
Word Party,"JG! I’m a big fan, my dad and I used to watch the new Regular Show episode every week together back in 2010. What was it like working with Mark Hamill? How did you react when you found out he was voicing a character on your show? Really excited for Close Enough!"
Word Party,"1) How come the address in episode 8 wasn’t the real comic sans font?
2) Where did you get the names of these characters from?
3) What were some of your favorite cut ideas?
4) When making the switch from TBS to Max, what changes were you able to make?
5) How did that guy get the “you know what” hat? (Not the estruct, the other one that starts with an “e”)
6) If you knew you’d be on Max from the beginning, would you have gone for TV-MA?"
Word Party,"How are you? There are so many questions about Close Enough and Regular Show, but I just wanna know how you are."
Word Party,"Mr. Quintel, do you plan on bringing back William Salyers to make a debut in Close Enough? I'd love to hear Rigby again."
Word Party,"Will any of the main voice actors from Regular Show be making an appearance in Close Enough?

Edit: I should probably also say hi... Hi JG!"
Word Party,"I know Close Enough was announced a while back and then went into limbo, but how much input did you have on delaying it and then putting it on HBO Max?"
Word Party,also where can I get a mordecai & the rigby’s shirt
Word Party,"Hi J.G.!!

I gotta ask: how did the whole “stripper clowns” idea come around?

And since you mentioned it, how long exactly did it take you to finish that puzzle?

Side note: Thanks for returning to the world of animation. Regular Show was one of my biggest influences during the early 2010s and I’m so happy that Close Enough is the successor I never knew I needed. You’re a cool guy."
Word Party,"I don't have questions. 

Just thank you for being a big part of my childhood. :)"
Word Party,What caused Close Enough to go from TBS to HBO Max?
Word Party,"It's a honor to ask you a question Mr. Quintel! 

As an aspiring animator (17) myself, I sometimes suffer burnout and doubt myself on the ideas I want to do in my animated shorts and through watching other people's work. For you, you've been doing this for a long time (2AM in the PM to Close Enough now), I wanted to ask how you still stay passionate about what you're doing in this competitive field of film/animation. Also, do you think you want to experiment in live action at all?"
Word Party,"Is there later changed censorship in Close Enough? For instance, I was wondering for that episode where Bridgette has paint all over her and jumps into the wall where she isn't wearing a bra? The Close Enough twitter posted a tweet some time ago where she clearly didn't have one on (with pixel censors) but the official episode upload has a bra on. There are also two versions of Candace's quilt art where the pixelation shows pink/black bits while the HBO Max one has full skin color pixels.

So in short, did some finished material get extra censorship or something?

Your work is great, and I especially find the characters you voice especially entertaining. You're a fantastic writer and very enjoyable voice actor. If nothing else, just wanted to comment that so you might see it. Take care."
Word Party,"Hi JG, are there deleted episodes of regular show that never aired, and if they are will they ever be released?"
Word Party,What are your tips on creating character dynamics?
Word Party,"Hey JG, I've been a huge fan of your work for many years - Regular Show was by far my favourite childhood show when I was younger and I'm greatly looking forward to Close Enough.

My questions for you are what film/tv show most greatly influenced your writing on Regular Show, and what would your advice be for getting into the animation industry?

Thanks alot!"
Word Party,"Hi, JG. I'll be honest, I've never seen Regular Show, but I absolutely love Close Enough. I especially loved all the Jim Carrey references in the season finale (he's my favorite actor).
I know the show was originally meant to be released in 2017. I was curious, when was production on the first season (i.e. writing, animation, voice recording, etc.) finished, and if it gets renewed for a second season, would the passage of time make it difficult to get the same cast and crew back together?"
Word Party,"First off I'm a huge fan of everything you've worked on and Regular Show has inspired me in my endeavors to create my own show. My question is pretty straightforward, I haven't got to watch the new show yet but seeing the trailer they released for HBO Max it feels kinda different to the first trailer TBS released awhile back. What sort of changes has the show gone through due to the transition from one channel to a whole new streaming service? Did you get more freedom or did you have to dial it back a bit?"
Word Party,"Why wasn't ""Regular Show: The Movie"" called ""The Regular Movie""?"
Word Party,What's your favorite cartoon that isnt Regular Show or Close Enough?
Word Party,"Hi JG, huge fan of your work though my mom thinks watching Regular Show at midnight is giving me nightmares haha! Anyway I want to ask, have you had ideas for Regular Show that were so crazy, they couldn't make the cut in order to keep the PG rating?"
Word Party,Hello JG I would like to know how did you come up with the way your characters act and how they look
Word Party,"Hi JG Quintel, I loved your work and humor on both Regular Show and Close Enough. I want to ask what gave you the idea to include your old shorts in the Regular Show series finale the way that you did? I can't wait to see more work from you in the future!"
Word Party,"Hi JG. This is the obligatory “fan of your work” comment but really me and my friends watched Regular Show and Adventure Time maybe too much in high school and I have been excited for Close Enough for years, I will start watching this weekend. My question is, having seen so many cartoons be given the reboot treatment in the past several years, if you could helm a new version of an animated show you love, what would it be and how would you approach it?"
Word Party,"Hi JG, First of all, big fan of RS! I love how you created characters from different backgrounds and make them work so smoothly, specially Hector, the cyborg who sells fireworks. And the series finale!  What an amazing and heartbreaking way to finish the series. Thank you and the team behind it for creating a show that will live forever.  


A couple of questions:   


* Which other carreer path would you have chosen other than animation?
* If you could eat only one thing for the rest of your life, what would it be?   


Best of luck with ""Close Enough"". I'm sure it will be a success! 

Thanks! Greetings from Mexico!"
Word Party,"My friends and I always wonder what type of drugs you were on while creating regular show. I don’t know how anyone could come up with such insanely creative concepts otherwise. Aside from that, though, I love regular show and your original shorts like two in the AM PM. Whenever I get together with my friends these are constantly quoted. Thanks for creating some awesome stuff. I’m looking forward to what you’ve got coming next."
Word Party,Hi JG quick question. Was anyone that worked on regular upset about “pissed” being replaced with “ticked”? My friend had the first season on dvd and we would shit a brick she Mordecai would put “it” into motion.
Word Party,"Not so much of a question, but I owe you a huge thanks. A quick story; last year my two best friends and I went off to college together. On the second night of being there, we had a meeting for our dorm floor. At some point the RAs told us that we would be allowed to name our floor; a name that would last forever at the school. Immediately my buddy leaned to me and whispered “Trash Boat”. I laughed, and told him it was goofy but they wouldn’t like it. Little did I know the guy sitting behind us was like “Trash Boat? Hell yeah” and so we all got on board, the three of us pushing hardest for it. In the end they told us we couldn’t have the name (even after setting up a meeting with the hall director for it). But the name Trash Boat did stick with us, and now whenever anybody who lives near us sees our friend group, they throw up their hands and yell “TRASH BOAAAAAAT”. It’s pretty amazing and I have no idea how everyone caught on to calling us this but I love you. We even all got boat tattoos to commemorate our long standing friendship. So thanks so much for inspiring us, JG Quintel!"
Word Party,"In regular show, the episode “Do me a solid”, what was the last solid rigby made mordecai do that was done off screen?"
Word Party,"Why did Cartoon Network allow the lite swear words in the early regular show episodes, but then cut back on it eventually?"
Word Party,[deleted]
Word Party,"Long time fan, congrats on the new show. What’s next after season one of close enough? Working on season 2?"
Word Party,"Hey JG, huge fan, just wondering what your role was in the creation of this show and how it compares to regular show"
Word Party,"Have you always wanted to do a show that really had no limits of humor and content? In Regular Show there are jokes and references made for adults, but this show goes 10x the scale."
NSU German History X,"It was a great series and one of my favorites. The first two seasons aired on ABC and didn't get the ratings they were hoping for. It was not a cheap show and filmed all over the world. I think viewers expected movie-like adventures (Harrison Ford did play Indy for one episode) instead of a coming-of-age story.  Family Channel took it over and aired the final four films. Lucas envisioned it as an educational project which could be shown in schools to get kids interested in historical figures. 

When they brought it out on DVD, they included a lot of supplemental material and reworked and paired the episodes into 22 two-hour movies. They added some new clips to make some episodes work together. The youngest version of Indy, Corey Carrier, had grown quite a bit by this point, so they digitally shrank him to make him look younger in the new footage. They dumped the series' George Hall as elderly Indy bookends and that was okay with me. 

In the fourth Indiana Jones feature film, Indy mentioned that he rode with Pancho Villa, a direct reference to the two-hour premiere of Young Indy. Most didn't get the reference but it made me smile that the show hasn't completely been forgotten."
NSU German History X,I really enjoyed this show back in the day. Not sure why Disney+ hasn't put this up on their service. Maybe they're waiting for this summer?
NSU German History X,"I just watched a video about this show over the weekend.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gmF0OacqeY&t=947s"
NSU German History X,"It’s such a fun premise for a series and the cast is great, so I can mostly forgive it for not being very good."
NSU German History X,"The books were great choose your own adventure, but I enjoyed the other series of young Indiana that didn't correspond to the show. Love how he'd just pop up somewhere new every book, Colorado, Ireland, the South, China, Russia, and giving young me a little taste of the area."
NSU German History X,"The best episode was the one in Prague. ""Just instal a phone at the new location, as simple as that"" .. or similary worded"
NSU German History X,"I'd rather see a ""Young Indian Jones"" movie than another old Indiana Jones movie."
NSU German History X,"I didn't like the first few episodes where Indy was a kid but when Sean Patrick Flannery took over playing teen Indy is when the show really took off.

Watching this show sparked my interest in WW1 history.

If you stalled out watching kid Indy like I did give the show another chance and skip to where he joins up to fight in WW1."
NSU German History X,"Could be a rights issue. The show was co-produced by Lucasfilm, Amblin Television, and Paramount Television"
NSU German History X,It’s on Paramount+
NSU German History X,Haven't seen that video yet and will surely watch it all! Thanks!
NSU German History X,"Indy's most frustrating adventure yet -- trying to get a phone installed in Prague and filling out confusing paperwork. There are tons of hilarious Kafka references in the episode. Franz Kafka is shown working at an insurance company and he takes pity on Indy. Kafka had already written Metamorphosis by this point but watching Indy, he's supposedly inspired to write The Trial."
NSU German History X,"That was a fun one. The whole bit was a take on the themes of Kafka's work, who he also runs into."
NSU German History X,I felt the same way. To be honest I never finished an episode with the first Indy. It did take off with Sean indeed. The WWI episodes were the best. The fact it has so much WWI content is what makes this series so unique. Great that it sparked your interest in it.
NSU German History X,I've got Paramount+ and haven't been able to find it. Just the movies. I'm in America.
NSU German History X,You should really watch this episode of PBS 'Pioneers Of Television.' Shatner screwed up the take on purpose then refused to redo it just so they'd have to use the kiss. The Network and sponsors got cold feet at the last minute and wanted to toss it. 
NSU German History X,"In her autobiography Nichols cites a letter from a white Southerner who at the time wrote, ""I am totally opposed to the mixing of the races. However, any time a red-blooded American boy like Captain Kirk gets a beautiful dame in his arms that looks like Uhura, he ain't gonna fight it."""
NSU German History X,"18 years ago, test audiences lost their shit when Jet Li kissed  Aaliyah (RIP) and then canned the whole thing.  Years later my chinese friend was then like 'holy shit Jet Li is gonna probly kiss Carla Gugino.... ok nevermind"". "
NSU German History X,"My friend’s dad used to say, “it’s all pink on the inside.” "
NSU German History X,"I'd also recommend watching the Drunk History segment about it to understand a few other things surrounding this role and the bad bitchery of Nichelle Nichols. 


Link: https://youtu.be/o-uJOzkrJV4"
NSU German History X,"It was fucking mind rape, though.  Even in this bold “oh my god we’re gonna do an interracial kiss” episode, they still had to be like “but obviously he doesn’t want to kiss her, he’s being forced!”  In Kirk’s mind, obviously, he doesn’t want to kiss her because he’s her commanding officer and he respects her and he doesn’t want to sexually assault her.   But for the viewers at home, Kirk’s response to an interracial kiss is struggling desperately to stop it from happening.

But it is cool it happened, however it happened. And it’s even cooler that everyone on set worked together to sabotage the fuck out of the “they don’t kiss” alternate take, so the network would be forced to air one of the takes where they did kiss."
NSU German History X,He also had the worst human-lizard man fight in the history of the galaxy. 
NSU German History X,I believe Nichelle Nichols' brother is currently in a spaceship tracking the Hale-Bopp comet if memory serves.
NSU German History X,"It gets lost, how groundbreaking it was to have a woman officer on the bridge, much less a black woman. 

I was in college when Star Trek debuted. Watched every Thursday night in the basement of my boyfriend's frat. God, I loved that show. Sure, the monsters were in monster suits but the rest of it was spectacular as far as special effects. 

Then there was Sulu and Checkov and Scottie, such a  cosmopolitan cast! All the other shows were populated largely by white Americans, mostly men because of all the western and war programs. Even the Indians were white men."

NSU German History X,"Funny story I read that originally they wanted it to be nichelle Nichols and Leonard nimoy because it might not be as offensive to the south but story wise it wouldn't work and Shatner didn't want it changed.""could you really blame him."" Lol 😈"
NSU German History X,It doesn't count if youre both under alien mind control
NSU German History X,"I read that the kiss was originally supposed to be between Nichols and  Leonard Nimoy, but Shatner insisted that he do it. That probably inspired the set up between Uhura and Spock in JJ Abrams Star Trek. "
NSU German History X,technically every kiss James T Kirk had was interracial. this is just the first time the actress was of African descent.

NSU German History X,"I think it's telling that everyone celebrates that moment of this episode, but ignore the fact that 45 seconds after the extremely awkward kiss, Kirk is cracking a bullwhip at a cowering Uhura.  That kiss milestone had an immediate, hard step backwards."
NSU German History X,"Only 50 years ago?! How absurd. 

The first interracial kiss on television should have happened centuries ago!"
NSU German History X,Interracial because he's jewish?
NSU German History X,"Lucky bastard done kissed all the colored girls. Black, white, green..."
NSU German History X,Interracial couples go way back.  They were just secret back then. I remember former congressman Ron Paul who is a doctor who delivers babies as an obgyn.  He helped deliver interracial babies back in the early 1960s when it was kind of frowned upon.  We've come a long way.  
NSU German History X,One of the first? So they didn't break ground? Who was actually first? 
NSU German History X,"I'm really thankful that Star Trek had the guts to do this back then. Since it happened 50 years ago today and today is the third Thursday of November, we should make it so that every third Thursday in November in the future will be a day celebration of thankfulness for this historic cultural breakthrough"

Shatner pitched a fit."
NSU German History X,"It's interesting that we often hear that this is the very first interracial kiss on U.S. television, when it in fact happened several times since 1960.  
  
Interestingly, this is also not the first interracial kiss on star trek! The 1967 episode ""Mirror, Mirror"" also featured an interracial kiss between the Eurasian actress Barbara Luna and Shatner."

Limitless,He’s a scientific Guinea Pig for the sole reason of how much gear he was on for Thor Love and Thunder. His physique was the most impressive I’ve ever seen an actor ( actor without history in bodybuilding or wrestling) achieve.
Limitless,"Lol. Disney got him on steroids to be thor. And now they're making a show out of managing the consequences of steroids. 
At least he got paid."
Limitless,The experiment was when he blasted inhumane amounts of trenbolone for Thor

Limitless,The **true** hammer of Thor…Trenjolnir
Limitless,"Yeah, my first thought was if this was going to address his obvious steroid use at all, given the focus on longevity."
Limitless,He actually got that big for his role in the upcoming Hulk Hogan biopic.
Limitless,"It’s good to see like the roid jaw is reversing, he looked unsettling"
Limitless,The scene where Zeus strips him has to be CGI though.
Limitless,He wasn't a guinea pig. They knew what would happen to him and encouraged it anyway.
Limitless,"honest question, if a large enough team of nutritionists, dieticians, trainers, cooks, doctors, etc, was hired, could we be achieve such a physique?  Even with ample time, could it be done naturally?  I’d imagine most actors would prefer to do it naturally and responsibly, especially if the studio is footing the bill"

Limitless,_The new pair of trousers were too long. Together they learn of a hem’s worth._
Limitless,Why is he producing this shit lmao? Weird.
Limitless,"It's a tough thing to tackle, because unlike women in the 2000s who were required to become unnaturally skinny, and develop unhealthy nutritional habits, current male actors are asked to get into the best physical shape (and in a lot of case, the best health) of their lives, which is patently more difficult to argue against. 

Even if you go into the steroid issue, only the superheroes (and guys doing superfast transformations) are juicing, everyone else is just expected to be in great shape. So eventhough, this sets up unrealistic body standards, its viewed as aspirational by many, and people just aren't ready to talk about how body dismorphia is a problem amongst men too"
Limitless,"""Eat clen, tren hard, anavar give up!"""

Limitless,"It'll be pretty great if there's a scene where a dr's like ""your testosterone numbers are triple that of a man your age"" and they just play it off with like ""Chris eats really healthy, and stays active,"""
Limitless,No. Russell Crowe actually has the ability to just flick people's clothes off. I'm glad they finally found a way to work it into a movie organically.
Limitless,i don’t think so. i watched the making of thor on disney and behind the scenes he looks massive.
Limitless,"Yeah, the arse is CGI'd. In the latest Assembled show you can still see he has underpants. (Unless they CGI'd that for TV)"
Limitless,"I think there was almost certainly some used in that scene, yeah. He's huge but that looked just a bit too perfect to me."
Limitless,Spoilers sweetie spoilers
Limitless,"No, you physically can’t get as big as he was in Thor: Love and Thunder. It takes years just to get naturally big."
Limitless,No. It is impossible to get a body half as large at the leanness that he had without steroids even with perfect diet and perfect training.
Limitless,"It has to do with 3 things, Strength, Muscle Mass, and Leanness. If you ever see anyone claiming  to have or performing all three at a high level, they are 100% on PEDs.  If someone is incredibly strong, they usually look a bit bloated or not 'cut'. If someone is super lean and cut, they are definitely not strong because of the intense strain getting that low body fat % puts on your body, hormones, and energy levels. If someone is a mass monster, they might be strong, but weaker than the people who train purely for strength in specific exercises, but they probably aren't insanely lean.  

There are genetic abnormalities where someone has elite genetics that let them present at a lower body fat % than other people with the same amount of effort, or put on muscle faster because your body doesn't produce enough signals to stop the production of muscle. There was a woman who had this genetic mutation and she  looked like someone that worked out every day and had decent muscle presentation when all she did was some basic running everyday 

If you had all the time in the world and trained with a team of professionals under the goal of achieving a substance enhanced physique, you probably would get half of what he looked like."
Limitless,I am pretty sure that Robert Pattinson only trained “naturally” for Batman and in some interview there were hints that he didn’t want to go on the steroid train like marvel actors
Limitless,"No, your max physique has a genetic limit based mostly on your frame. You can stronger and stronger without necessarily growing size."
Limitless,"  
No"
Limitless,r/Beetlejuicing ?
Limitless,Two episode max?
Limitless,"Welcome to *My Life*, starring: me."
Limitless,UMN-limited
Limitless,It's got an alternate ending
Limitless,"This is an interesting view! Physically, it’s certainly more demanding to attain the superhero actor body, or even the lean/muscular male physique. Prob easier to get the skinny aesthetic, more damaging long term though"
Limitless,Don't forget to test your limits so you can dbolish your goals!
Limitless,Bruh that joke is as old as the Thor movies.
Limitless,Testosterone levels in steroid users are usually low.
Limitless,"""Lots of brown rice, chicken, and broccoli"""
Limitless,"and when he disinvited Hemsworth from that night’s orgy, that was also real.  Hemsworth did not attend the carnal festivities in Crowe’s trailer that evening

EDIT: grammar"
Limitless,"I thought that was Sir Patrick ""It's too late, I've seen everything"" Stewart."
Limitless,There’s another article going over how he got bigger for that film than he ever has before due to Covid giving him nothing but time to exercise. He also doesn’t wanna do that again.
Limitless,They'd never admit he was on something.
Limitless,It was in the trailer
Limitless,"It's possible. You just need god given genetics and be one in a million. Not his peak physique, but half of it, yeah"
Limitless,"Dude, Pattinson in batman is like the least muscled an actor has ever looked in a capeshit. He is barely cut and you can see fat on his muscles.

It was actually quite refreshing to see normal looking hero, [lots of guys in my gym and I have better shoulders then him. ](https://i.imgur.com/7bAJOyo.jpg)

Limitless,aired over the span of a fork knife.
Limitless,Only if they go off the sauce. When they are on the sauce they have it at like 1200
Limitless,what the fuck are you talking about
Limitless,"Of course not, but we all know he is. Behind The Rock he may be the most juiced guy in film right now. And they're likely using CGI on top of that. 

Nothing wrong with that though, imo. Real people don't have superhero physiques."
Limitless,"'Not his peak physique, but half of it, yeah'

&#x200B;

So it's not possible then."
Limitless,No it's not possible man
Limitless,Completely depends on what they are taking. He could be on a maintenance dose of trt while blasting something that doesn't count towards t levels.
Limitless,"If they are using TRT yeah, other steroids no."
Limitless,"That low T levels are a sign of taking most things people call ""steroids."" Except for TRT, but even then your testosterone will be low when you aren't on it."
Limitless,"I think it's harmful because while they don't admit it, they pretend that it was natural in their interviews or marketing articles. Pretending that he got that physique because ""he worked hard during covid"" is harmful. It creates this idea that it is somewhat easy to do. A lot of men struggle with their physique and no matter what they'll do, they are not gonna achieve similar result in even triple that period. It's not just him. A lot of actors do it."
Limitless,The original comment was literally talking about accomplishing half the peak physique...
Limitless,so his trt dose means he would have decent testosterone levels. Stop talking man.
Limitless,"yes, people who are just coming off a cycle or trt will have low testosterone as their hpta has been shut down. why would someone who was on trt go off it? The vast majority of people that use gear cycle and cruise, and as a result have either high normal or high test."
Limitless,"That's fair, when I said ""nothing wrong"" I meant the actual practice, not the denial of it, which is indeed problematic. 

If you bother to do some research into training you find out pretty quickly that those results aren't natural, but it should be on them to be open about that just as much as it is on everyone else to do understand the limits of training naturally."
Limitless,"Well my main experience in reading about this stuff is athletes, who come off it to try and pass tests. Though that wouldn't really apply to an actor."
Limitless,"..right, so you don't really know what you are talking about."
Limitless,"Average ratings, and CBS execs didn't have a lot of faith in it after the first season. Which was a damn shame, because it was an enjoyable series.

It was on Netflix for a while. Nor sure if it's still lurking out there at all or not."
Limitless,Is that about the guy who becomes limitless?
Limitless,The bruntouchables was so good
Crazy Ex-Girlfriend,CEXG most underrated show of the last decade. Will absolutely be there
Crazy Ex-Girlfriend,"I liked Crazy Ex Girlfriend but I have a weird aversion to an actor playing 2 roles in the same scene. I just can't stop thinking about the production, the camera angle, the adr, the script supervisor reading the lines. It drives me nuts. I wish they just hired another actor."
Crazy Ex-Girlfriend,"I love how three different people have referred to Crazy ex-girlfriend as ""CXG"" ""CXGF"" and ""CEXG"" in these comments."
Crazy Ex-Girlfriend,"Looking forward to it, but this is also gonna make me miss Adam Schlesinger even more. RIP and fuck COVID-19."
Crazy Ex-Girlfriend,">revolves around an impossibly badass spy (Bloom) who tires of her life of sexy espionage and goes to live with her pushover twin sister (also played by Bloom) and, together, they learn what it means to actually be badass.


this summary is making me cringe but some shows are better in action than on paper"
Crazy Ex-Girlfriend,Yay! CXG was my shit
Crazy Ex-Girlfriend,Playing a twin seems like overall needless production complication.
Crazy Ex-Girlfriend,"It's kind of a weird that Crazy Ex Girlfriend was on Cw. I never watch any shows from that network that's full of superhero shows and stuff not aimed at me. Then they have dark musical/comedy with insane levels psychological depth like Bojack Horseman. It's off brand as hell, but credit to the network for seeing that show through.

Happy to see Rachel Bloom from ""Fuck Me, Ray Bradbury"" video go so far. I don't know what it is, but her style of comedy resonates with me."
Crazy Ex-Girlfriend,2xRachel Bloom will make it worth it if done right.   I loved Crazy-Ex Girlfriend.  That show was brilliantly goofy.
Crazy Ex-Girlfriend,"After CXG, I'll pretty much watch anything with Bloom in it.  Can't wait!"
Crazy Ex-Girlfriend,Kinda looks like Kate Middleton
Crazy Ex-Girlfriend,[deleted]
Crazy Ex-Girlfriend,[deleted]
Crazy Ex-Girlfriend,May I recommend Orphan Black? I think you’ll enjoy it.
Crazy Ex-Girlfriend,Normally I agree but I can think of exceptions too. The Deuce for instance managed to pull it off.
Crazy Ex-Girlfriend,I think Rachel Bloom is enormously talented but playing two drastically different characters in the same show is maybe the only thing I can’t imagine her doing well at?
Crazy Ex-Girlfriend,"Yeah, for me Crazy Ex-Girlfriend was exactly one of those shows (""it's about a lawyer who's obsessed with a guy she went to summer camp with and impulse-moves across the country to try to be with him, and also it's a musical"") so I'm willing to give some leeway."
Crazy Ex-Girlfriend,"Crazy Ex had a cringey title and premise, and was only allowed to exist because a small number of fans and critics saw past it."
Crazy Ex-Girlfriend,I love CXG but it is one of the only shows I have to space out watching for cringe relates issues..... It's just overwhelming at times
Crazy Ex-Girlfriend,"CXG was one of the rare shows devoted to ensuring workers had a work/life balance, which they credited with having so many mothers involved in production.

I imagine they thought of ways to reduce production time before committing to this concept."
Crazy Ex-Girlfriend,I think the pilot was made for showtime or HBO. I saw that version at The Paley Center and I think originally the show was going to be way more explicit.
Crazy Ex-Girlfriend,I love super hero stuff and still don't watch any of the ones on CW.
Crazy Ex-Girlfriend," I thought that too, until I saw the opening number of CXGF."
Crazy Ex-Girlfriend,Nothing in this article says that this show will be a musical like their last project.
Crazy Ex-Girlfriend,You ain’t wrong
Crazy Ex-Girlfriend,"The cruelty of this comment lmao.

(It really is an amazing show though)"
Crazy Ex-Girlfriend,"Damn, I would never have watched it if it was described to me like that!"
Crazy Ex-Girlfriend,"The rumour I heard was that the head of the CW at the time was a huge fan of the show personally, and renewed it when any other show would have been cancelled with the same numbers."
Crazy Ex-Girlfriend,"Is this comment supposed to be as disparaging as it sounds? Crazy Ex Girlfriend was a fantastic show. It's not going to be for everyone, but it's one of my favorite shows and I was sad it ended."
Crazy Ex-Girlfriend,"Exactly. Bloom's whole schtick is cringe comedy. I've no doubt this show will be as subversive, hilarious, and enjoyable as Crazy Ex-Girlfriend was."
Crazy Ex-Girlfriend,Even the trailer kind of put me off but back then I watched just about everything the CW threw at me so I checked it out anyway and was pleasantly surprised.
Crazy Ex-Girlfriend,"Oh fascinating. Do you have any sources for that? 

*not being snarky. I work in the industry and am curious about this, as musical numbers make for more complicated shooting schedules so I’m curious how they pulled it off"
Crazy Ex-Girlfriend,Especially since the person who wrote all the music for CXG died from COVID
Crazy Ex-Girlfriend,"it was also like, pretty much the only show that would get their network mentioned on award shows"
Crazy Ex-Girlfriend,"The ratings were *abysmal.* Very often it was the bottom ranked show of all network television, losing out to CW repeats even. It must have done well on streaming and on demand though, and it did give the network ratings buzz."
Crazy Ex-Girlfriend,Did you like the last season? I'm a big Rachel Bloom fan but that last season for me as very rough. Recasting Santino Fantana's Greg was a huge mistake imo since he was so incredibly charismatic and likable.
Crazy Ex-Girlfriend,"he didn't write all the music, did he?"
Crazy Ex-Girlfriend,"I will concede that the last season wasn't the best but I didn't mind the Santino recasting. Recasting in general isn't a huge deal for me.

There series had a plan though which they stuck to and executed. I don't really rewatch the show anymore but occasionally I'll watch a song on Youtube.

For me, the comedy music genre would have and probably did absolve a lot of the narrative mess that came with Crazy Ex Girlfriend."

Crazy Ex-Girlfriend,Supernatural is the most indestructible show on television.
Crazy Ex-Girlfriend,"My grandpa fought in WW2. He told me a story once about how the very first thing he did when he got back from Germany was kiss my grandma, then they curled up on the couch and watched the series premiere of Supernatural."
Crazy Ex-Girlfriend,"I like how Rachel Bloom announced it on her Twitter just now: ""BEHOLD ME, FOR I AM IMMORTAL AND WILL NEVER DIE""."
Crazy Ex-Girlfriend,So...we going to get that finale of Vampire Dairies with the final scene being a black Chevrolet Impala driving into town?
Crazy Ex-Girlfriend,13 seasons of Sopernatural.   That's an amazing feat.   
Crazy Ex-Girlfriend,"Crazy Ex Girlfriend will likely be the lowest rated show on broadcast tv for at least 3 straight years now.

Please never let it die"
Crazy Ex-Girlfriend,And the city of Vancouver breathes a collective sigh of relief.
Crazy Ex-Girlfriend,Season 27 of supernatural? 
Crazy Ex-Girlfriend,Jane the Virgin is an amazing show and I'm so happy it's being renewed! 
Crazy Ex-Girlfriend,"Congrats to Rachel Bloom on the Crazy Ex-Girlfriend renewal. Between this and the Golden Globes later today (possible win?), she's having one heck of a Sunday!"
Crazy Ex-Girlfriend,Carry on my Wayward Son. They'll be peace when are do... well shit don't think that is ever gonna happen!
Crazy Ex-Girlfriend,"At three seasons, maybe people will finally catch up to streaming Crazy Ex Girlfriend and it'll become more than a cult hit. It's really fucking good guys. Not sure what the storyline for season 3 will be but those writers know how to keep it open even if they weren't sure it was going to be renewed"
Crazy Ex-Girlfriend,"Please don't cancel iZombie, please don't cancel iZombie.

Please."
Crazy Ex-Girlfriend,"As a fan of The Flash, Supernatural, Arrow and LOT this is a very good news. "
Crazy Ex-Girlfriend,"So happy! I love The Flash, have been enjoying Supergirl this season, and am a big fan of the DCTV crossovers, so I'm very happy that they all got renewed.

Crazy-ex-Girlfriend is something I have to try watching, I've only ever heard great things about it."
Crazy Ex-Girlfriend,"Yay more Supernatural,  been watching for over a decade now and still enjoying it. "
Crazy Ex-Girlfriend,Yay - more supernatural!
Crazy Ex-Girlfriend,"Sweet jesus, Supernatural will never die will it?"
Crazy Ex-Girlfriend,"Really really surprised they're renewing CEG this early but I'll take it! 

Also, has anyone actually been watching this season of Arrow? Is it any better than last year?"
Crazy Ex-Girlfriend,What about iZombie?
Crazy Ex-Girlfriend,"*Supernatural* with it's Thirteen Season (2017-2018) will bring that show to 285 episodes.

Didn't they say last year that it might end at 300 episodes? So I guess that confirms a short final Fourteenth Season of 15 episodes for 2019.

Does that officially make it the longest running prime-time scripted American series?"
Crazy Ex-Girlfriend,The creators of Crazy Ex Girlfriend always said they wanted the show to have just four seasons. I think The CW is going to give it to them at this point - all for the award potential. There's really no other reason why it would be renewed for a second time otherwise.
Crazy Ex-Girlfriend,"Great for Supergirl, but I miss Cat. I understand that Calista didn't want to move to Canada, but she was my favorite character. 

I read that she'll still pop in from time to time, but it's not the same dynamic between Cat and Kara that I loved in season 1."
Crazy Ex-Girlfriend,"Yeah, more Superhero crossovers! I am loving the DCTVerse way more than the DCMovieverse. It is simply so much more fun. I also like how the writers of the shows went from, okay, we aren't going to do this, this and this and we are going to kill this, this and this character so it doesn't conflict with the movies to Oh, the movies suck, all the stuff we weren't going to do, it's back on and let's see if we can bring back those characters we killed. Everything is back on the menu, people! 

Also, Supernatural is never going to end. I laughed when they said they were going to bring in Rick Springfield as Lucifer this season but, Jesus, he made Lucifer terrifying. Not snarky fun like Pellegrino's  but really scary. Who knew? "
Crazy Ex-Girlfriend,Fuck does this mean they aren't renewing izombie? Or would that be announced during or after season 3??
Crazy Ex-Girlfriend,I have a lot of faith in Supernatural when it comes to a satisfying ending at this point.
Crazy Ex-Girlfriend,"I love Legends. It doesn't get a lot of love, but I'd watch an entire series of Purcell and Miller as Heatwave/Captain Cold. "
Crazy Ex-Girlfriend,"Excited about Constantine being back albeit animated. How can I easily view this series (not having cable). Would like to check out along with Vixen's show.

Edit: Thanks for the suggestions :) I was hoping it would be on Netflix with other CW shows, but as long as I don't have to subscribe or sacrifice my first born I'll check out the CW seed site."
Crazy Ex-Girlfriend,Crowley still knocking about in Supernatural? Was my favourite character (til I gave up during season 10) Mark Sheppard deserves a lot of plaudits for that character.
Crazy Ex-Girlfriend,"Legends is the funnest show on TV. People complain about technical shit, but I just turn my brain off and have a blast watching it. "
Crazy Ex-Girlfriend,Please let iZombie and the100 do well.  I don't want those to get cancelled 
Crazy Ex-Girlfriend,Sucks for anyone developing a new show for the CW. 
Crazy Ex-Girlfriend,Okay should I watch Supernatural? It seems like I am missing out on something.
Crazy Ex-Girlfriend,"Legends kind of sucks but in an endearingly goofy way. Glad Flash is continuing although it is inconsistent in quality, it is always fun. I don't watch Arrow unless it's a crossover  ep. "
Crazy Ex-Girlfriend,Here's to hoping they renew The 100.
Crazy Ex-Girlfriend,Hooray for CEG and Supergirl Season 3's
Crazy Ex-Girlfriend,"CW is the Oprah Winfrey of cable channels.    
""You get a renewal! You get a renewal! Everyone gets a renewal!"""
Crazy Ex-Girlfriend,Carry on my wayward son.
Crazy Ex-Girlfriend,"Took me 6 months to catch up to supernatural, would recommend 10/10."
Crazy Ex-Girlfriend,More supernatural fan fic seasons! 
Crazy Ex-Girlfriend,Wow I can't believe I have been watching supernatural since high school... I graduated in 2003...
Crazy Ex-Girlfriend,"Supernatural still going strong.

I need to pick it back up."
Crazy Ex-Girlfriend,God damn it I was pulling so hard for No Tomorrow. It is so damn charming and just all around upbeat in a way that isn't cheesy. 
Crazy Ex-Girlfriend,"I watch the 1st 4 so good to hear them getting renewed.  Been thinking about getting back into ""Supernatural"" as I stopped watching in the middle of the 11th season."
Crazy Ex-Girlfriend,You get a renewal. You get a renewal. You all get renewals!
Crazy Ex-Girlfriend,60 seasons and a movie!
Crazy Ex-Girlfriend,"If anyone needs to know why Supernatural is still going simply watch one episode... 'The French Mistake'.

Edited a word."
Crazy Ex-Girlfriend,Damn shame about Frequency. I loved the movie and the show is really good too. Great acting and it feels more like watching a long movie than a TV Show. Shows like that unfortunately don't last long while paint by numbers procedurals go on forever. 
Crazy Ex-Girlfriend,We are also getting an animated Constantine series on CW Seed!
Crazy Ex-Girlfriend,"As much as I enjoy how the show just simply continues to live on (like the Winchesters), I feel like it would be appropriate for Supernatural - a show that's filled to the brim with supernatural lore - to just end on its 13th season, y'know? "
Crazy Ex-Girlfriend,To the people that watch Grimm and Supernatural how would compare the two? I never watch Supernatural and super bummed out NBC canceled Grimm.
Crazy Ex-Girlfriend,Glad to hear about Legends of Tomorrow.  I honestly enjoy that show more than Arrow and Flash anymore.
Crazy Ex-Girlfriend,"I was in seventh grade when Supernatural started. I'm now a college graduate, and have a project '67 Impala with my dad.

And the show is still airing. Damn."
Crazy Ex-Girlfriend,Is ... is Jane still a virgin?
Crazy Ex-Girlfriend,Screw it let the kids from super natural get paid.. they will never break type casting. Although the character who played Sam did a couple c level horror movies. I just wish they did not bury and piss on it like some kind of of weird super natural ritual.
Crazy Ex-Girlfriend,"I remember flipping through a magazine that had Supernatural as a show to watch out for before it debuted. I remember thinking ""It looks really interesting, too bad it'll probably get cancelled like all cool shows."" I can't believe here we are a decade plus later lol."
Crazy Ex-Girlfriend,You can't lock up the darkness
Crazy Ex-Girlfriend,Supernatural!!!
Crazy Ex-Girlfriend,Soooo any chance that supernatural will cross over with the flarrow-verse?
Crazy Ex-Girlfriend,What about daredevil?
Crazy Ex-Girlfriend,"Knew Arrow was going again, they talked about how they will handle the flashbacks for season six last year."
Marcella,"A Big-Budget Fantasy Epic™ based on Astrid Lindgren's book? 

Well how about that."
Marcella,"Ronja was my au pair's favourite book, she gave it to us and we read it hundreds of times as bairns. Really curious about this!"
Marcella,"
Marcella was pretty good."
Marcella,[deleted]
Marcella,"You are doing Hulu and MGM+ dirty. You think all those high profile limited series with top Hollywood talent on Hulu (such as The Dropout, Dopesick, Pam & Tommy, Fleishman is in Trouble, and Under the Banner of Heaven) are cheap? Absolutely not. Same goes for the Spider-Man spin-off shows in the works for MGM+. 

These shows might not be $20 million per episode big budget like the Marvel shows, Stranger Things, The Yellowstone spin-offs, Rings of Power, The Morning Show, Masters of the Air, Citadel, or The Last of Us and House of the Dragon but they are absolutely big budget shows."
Marcella,First season was interesting but then it all went terribly bad.
Marcella,It was alright. Nothing great.
Marcella,I really enjoyed it and I wish there was more.
Marcella,First season was gripping. Second season lost me. Third season got me back.
Marcella,"Didn't work at all for me at all. Only made it about halfway through the first season. Was profoundly disappointed, since the showrunner, Hans Rosenfeldt, was the guy who did *Bron|Broen.* I probably had my expectations set too high because of that."
Marcella,"I've only seen the first two seasons. I quite liked the first season, it had an engaging plot line and kept me invested throughout. It did leave a few lose ends, but otherwise I was invested.

The second season however, I feel it just got a tad to bleak and disjointed for my liking. It didn't help that every plot seemed to end badly several in pretty contrived ways, and they killed off or ruined several of the more likable characters.

Likewise I felt the main character had gotten just a bit to unlikable. I mean she was already pretty abrasive and slightly vindictive back in season one, but season two dialled all those traits up coupled with making her considerably more corrupt and less competent.

Thus it got harder to ignore the fact she really shouldn't be doing this job considering the fact she was suffering from regular blackouts."
Marcella,"The first season was like a train wreck I couldn’t look away from. It was so poorly written, yet I was able to enjoy it to a certain extent. I don’t plan on watching future seasons though."
Marcella,"I'm watching now and as a fan of Loofah (Luther), can tell you I am in love. The photography, the editing, the music, the character, the blackouts, the asshole husband, everything fits and it's told at a great pace, no fillers."
Marcella,I'm glad you enjoyed it.  You would do yourself a great service if you stopped watching this series where you currently are.
Marcella,"Okay, but what about Cara? When did she meet Henry Gibson in order to steal from him?"
Marcella,I thought season two was alright until the end. Saw the trailer for season 3 and noped outta there
Marcella,I liked seasons 1 and 2. Stopped watching season 3 after about 4 episodes. It was just so much worse than the previous seasons.
Marcella,Season 3 has one of the most unintentionally funny murders in the whole show. It's not good though.
Marcella,Which one is unintentionally funny?
Marcella,When the sister runs back in the house to shoot her brother then immediately runs back out.
Marcella,The second season was great. The ending was very out of place and extremely different to the tone of the show.
Marcella,I thought the first season was very good.
Marcella,"Yes! And I loved the theme.

Edit: For anyone that liked it, I also recommend River. Basic premise is the same, British detective(Stellan Skaarsgaard.(sp?)) with mental health problems has to solve a crime."
Marcella,"It’s been awhile since I saw S1, but 3 or 4 eps into S2 and I can’t stand her husband. Was he this much of an asshole in the first season?? He’s just needlessly cruel and sociopathic, I don’t know how he has a gf or why his kids can stand him. I know Marcella’s crazy or whatever but she’s still better than that guy. Anyway I hope he dies. "
Marcella,"Sounds like it could be good, never heard of it before. I did like ""The Bridge"" (although I only saw the U.S. version of it) and apparently this has the same creator? Seems interesting."
Marcella,Looking forward to it.  I really liked the first season.
Marcella,Wtf is up with the dramatic music. 
Marcella,"I really enjoyed the first season and love the opposite actor that played her boyfriend who's in various other hit shows.  It was really good and I'm looking forward to rewatching season 1 to watching season 2, one bing binge!"
Marcella,Just finished season 2. Dayam it was good!
Marcella,This woman is just awful but I can’t look away. 
Marcella,"Just watched it last night. I'm still messed up. Marcella is my favorite netflix character, and I'm still processing."
Marcella,River is excellent but is a remake from the USA that not many people may know.  Raines starring Jeff goldblum with a great showrunner that was canceled 
Marcella,"Same. Jason is the worst. I finished S1 just so I can see how the writers punish that bastard. Needless to say, I was quite satisfied with what happened at Henry’s."
Marcella,"The first season is pretty good, don't watch the second one because it's just...not. The first series was depressing like Broadchurch but compelling enough to keep watching, the second series is super depressing and every single character is unlikable as hell."
Marcella,The first season was pretty enjoyable. I thought it started a little slow but liked the latter half quite a bit.
Marcella,"It's a detective story, but the lead is subject to fugue states/memory blackouts, which she hides from everyone. In season one, she gets a new case and believes that she herself may be the murderer.

She has the standard fucked up personal life, without which no modern detective show is complete."
Marcella,"Not surprising given the last scene. 

Tho how does everyone feel about the direction of the show? Her connection with the cases are way too close for comfort. The cresendo of last season was over the top and deeply uncomfortable but maybe that was the point. "
Marcella,"Because of that whacked-out ending, she is coming back as either La Femme Marcella...or a DC supervillain. "
Marcella,"The season 2 ending pissed me off, made not want to watch any more of the show "
Marcella,"I think the direction of the new season will be moving away from that, which is for the better. I am also hoping we won't have to see her family.  I couldn't stand her ex husband or her children.  "
Marcella,"I thought it was a great season except for that very weird ending.

But her personal connection to virtually every suspect/victim/witness started to go a bit overboard, and really pulled me out of the show. It killed my suspension of disbelief."
Marcella,"Shows with obsessed cops destroying themselves pursuing their cases have almost become a sub-genre.  Marcella reminded me of The Killing, with Marcella herself being even more unhinged.  It's hard to watch."
Marcella,I didn't finish the second season. Felt like a different show.
Marcella,#BringBackPushingDaisies
Marcella,"That's good, then. I enjoyed that show. Still wondering if ITV will commission a second series of it."
Marcella,"Meh, I love her to bits but I don't think anything about this show deserves awards.  It was not good."
Marcella,"ITV has, it's airing early 2018."
Marcella,which means we'll get it here in the US in 2019  :(
Marcella,"Oh, fantastic, thanks!"
Marcella,"Good but slow, just like The Fall.

Still don't understand why she was in the tub, or why she was losing time."
Marcella,"I felt like they were trying a bit too hard to make the viewer confused. There's so many possible murderers in the first 5 episodes that it all feels a little ridiculous. I still enjoyed the show though. The music is really good, and Marcella herself is pretty interesting. I thought the sub-plot of her husband accidentally ordering a hit was stupid too, only there to add an extra 4 possible murderers to ponder"
Marcella,Marcella was great. Recommend watching Luther on Netflix. 
Marcella,[Marcella](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt5269594/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1) 
Marcella,"I liked Marcella overall,  but there was a lot of holes in the story I wish were cleared up. At the end, I felt very confused whether or not Marcella is the killer or if someone else was since there was a lot of confusing things within the first season. Flawed. But enjoyable overall."
Marcella,I don't understand why she moved the body. 
Marcella,Just finished Luther! Great suggestion! 
Marcella,"Henry definitely killed Grace. We're still not sure why Marcella went *back* to Grace's house after going there to confront her. She had to have left the house, Henry came and killed her, Marcella came back and moved the body. Why? Maybe she had 2 blackouts. One where she confronted Grace and a 2nd where she went back and realise she was dead and was worried she might have killed her during the first blackout.

The dead immigrant in the car is still a question. Was Henry somehow able to track him down and kill him or did Marcella do it in a blackout state? If Marcella did it, it was for nothing since she didn't kill Grace. There's a theory that Tim (Marcella's lover) is covering her tracks for her."
Marcella,"I can only assume she thought she did it and blacked out, or her husband."
Marcella,[deleted]
Marcella,"Having only seen Marcella, I still recommend Hotel."
Marcella,"Scandinavian noir. Noir is one of those genres with the noticeable stylistic difference between subgenre (classic, French, neo-, modern, Scandinavian). I suspect that Scandinavian one is the furthest from noir and is just a synonym for dark comedy. Dark != noir. "
Marcella,"I found it too violent right away and dropped half way thru first episode.  Although I do like foreign stuff, I find hard to watch stuff that is too realistic."
Marcella,"I'm on episode two and I love it! Being in a police station myself, and suffering the disgusting way they treat assault victims, I find much comfort to see the humanity of even ONE person to maintain ACTUAL justice."
Marcella,[deleted]
Marcella,"I did and i enjoyed it, but after ss2, I felt exhausted, like her and I dont't think she will ever get happy ending anymore"
Marcella,"You should definitely check out season 2 (I literally just finished it).

Veronica (the protagonist) has an interesting character development, and her ineptness in S1 is precisely the trigger."
Marcella,How did she keep her badge? Just started S1E8 fucking Horrible. And how many people is she gonna get killed.
Marcella,"I just finished the first five episodes of season 2! Holy mother of Moses, I can't believe Anita was one of Martias' originals. And Veronica 's father was in cahoots with the orphanage. Yoo boy. 

On the subject of Mattias' actor, all i can say is....yum."
Marcella,"The similarities with ‘Marcella’ are striking: the ineptness, feigning death, cutting her hair, dying it blonde. But the icing on the cake was the reason behing her fake death. She did it for her family, she felt like a monster. 

Marcella has a lot more depth and the acting is good. Good Morning Veronica is an enjoyable watch despite the unnecessary gore but feels more like a (violent) telenovela compared to Marcella."
Marcella,"If your focus is all on the mystery then you may be let down, the first story with Lula Landry probably has the best out and out mystery, but for me this show is a vehicle to tell a more human story of loss and friendship.

Personally, I love it, the relationship between Strike and Robin is what makes it very watchable for me, although I may have a slight bias as I was already a big fan of both Tom Burke and Holliday Grainger before I stared it. Sometimes half the battle with these shows is in finding two likable lead actors whose relationship you can believe in, and for me they nailed that aspect."
Marcella,"Loved the books, but not a huge fan of the TV series. Usual reasons: unnecessary character and plot changes. I understand the necessity to cut out certain scenes, but frivolous character interpretations annoy the hell out of me. For example, in the books, Strike is military-style tidy, but BBC makes him piss in a jar cause he can't be bothered to go to the bathroom. WTF! I really don't understand why screenwriters have the urge to F-up original work. That said, loved the actress who plays Robin."
Marcella,"The TV series is pretty tame in comparison with the books. Tom Burke is great as Strike but he acts differently in situations to the book Strike would, like the scene with Whitaker for example. And Charlotte Campbell is too posh and not as glamorous as Robin is.

In The Silkworm book Robin steers and dodges traffic on the motorway. But what we get on TV is her driving through a field of hills."
Marcella,"I love it, but I love the Robert Galbraith (aka JK Rowling) books even more and occasionally hang out on r/cormoran_strike. For me, I think you'll do better with it if you like older-style literary-adaptation BBC detective shows (which were completely my jam through the '80s and '90s), not so much the colder/more violent Scandi-noir stuff, which looks like it's more in your wheelhouse. To me, *\[C.B.\] Strike* is very similar to *Case Histories* (which was based on Kate Atkinson's ""Jackson Brodie"" book series\]. I love both styles of crime drama (and can even do cozies), but a lot of folks prefer one or the other.

I enjoy *Unforgotten* and *Mare of Easttown,* but to me, they're not the best stuff ever. For me, that would be shows like Sally Wainwright's *Happy Valley* or Abi Morgan's *River,* or Hugo Blick's *Shadow Line* or *Black Earth Rising,* or the Williams brothers (*The Missing/Baptiste, Liar, Rellik, The Widow).*  Just different tastes."
Marcella,I really liked the books but I couldn't really get into the show
Marcella,"The two leads, Tom Burke and Holliday Grainger are great and make it worth watching. 

The mysteries are muddled as hell and over all are whatever. The second season's ""mystery"" was just garbage. 

> Currently drooling over how good ""Mare of Easttown"" is. True Detective Season One

If you are looking for something close to those two, C.B. Strike is not the show you want. 

C.B. Strike is passable at best. 

>  Hoping this meets my quality standards set by some of my favorites : The Break, Marcella, Shetland, Wallander, Bordertown, Bron, Deep Water, The Missing, Broadchurch, Der Pass, etc.

It is not on par with any of those."
Marcella,"Strike was.... boring as fuck tbh. Like, if you take the word ""typical"" and made it into a TV series lol. I don't feel much doubt saying that either, I believed I watched a whole 2 seasons."
Marcella,I’m a big crime fiction lover and have enjoyed many on your list I adored unforgotten. I’m a big fan of the strike books but the show was a let down still enjoyable but definitely not up to the standard if others on your list. You might want to add Canadian show Cardinal to your list it’s a good watch.
Marcella,"I like both actors, but am I the only one who couldn't buy their romantic chemistry? I believed fully in their platonic relationship and was looking forward to it being explored further, but once the longing looks started up, it just felt ridiculous."
Marcella,"I'm so glad I'm reading the books first. Burke & Grainger are excellent and I just hear them when reading but having watched Cuckoo's Calling and the first part of The Silkworm, I'm gutted by how they just suck out the meat of it.

What makes the first two books (currently on Career of Evil) so great is the detail, Strike and Robin, delving deep, the characterization, the thought process. None of that is in the series, it's so hopelessly rushed and simple, it's like a Cliffs Notes version of the books. The actors have so little to work with and the investigations so far are so simplistic and boring in the series, so easily solved. 

I'll keep watching and I hear it might get better with Lethal White where there's four episodes."
Marcella,Haha I appreciate this review. I never got through episode one thanks to the heads up. On to Cacciatore the Hunter next. Cheers!
Marcella,No I agree. It’s a lot of awkward glances and forced missed opportunities when in reality they’re quite different people and their unifying factor seems to be that they’re both damaged which doesn’t seem like a particularly strong basis for a relationship. Although they haven’t ended up together (yet) so maybe that’s the point.
Marcella,I just started watching this show but find myself annoyed by the Robin character and how she treats her husband.  I've only seen season 1 and the beginning of season 2 so I don't know how it turns out but I may not watch the rest of it because I don't really like watching that part of the story.  I'm more interested in the crime mystery part of the show.  The first episodes of season 1 with the Lula Landry murder mystery was what got me to keep watching it.
Marcella,Happy!(SyFy) w/ Christopher Meloni. Bat shit crazy show but well worth the watch!
Marcella,Southland was really underrated crime drama series.
Marcella,"Every time a thread like this pops up I always recommend the same thing...

Man Seeking Woman

A really inventive comedy series about dating in your 20s. It stars Jay Baruchel as Josh Greenberg, a pretty normal guy who just got dumped by his long term girlfriend.  What I really like about the series is it’s use of surreal situations as metaphor for what reality really feels like.
For example, deciding what to text to a girl suddenly becomes a [war room](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=mlUsyQzJAHI), or learning your balding from [the reaper himself](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=WBxsXgz4-jA&t=1s) .

Please give his show a shot I feel it should have been up there with the greats of comedy like 30 Rock or Community, it has that similar vibe"
Marcella,Get shorty on epix. But season 1 is on Netflix. The closest thing I can compare it to is to Barry on hbo
Marcella,[deleted]
Marcella,Rectify. One of the most critically acclaimed shows out there but was never watched by many people. It’s on Netflix now.
Marcella,"I'm not sure why Black Sails never really blew up in popularity.

It has some decent name actors putting in strong performances, a premise that's pretty decent and appeals to a lot of people, great action, mature themes, interesting character development, phenomenal music, continues to get better throughout it's run and finishes strong.

But it seems like it only ever amassed a niche audience.

For a really old show, I still think Yes Minister holds up incredibly well as a comedy if you're remotely interested in politics. It's funny how relevant the vast majority of it's jokes are today.

It was popular in it's day but time passes and great shows are forgotten."
Marcella,Damages was an amazing show that is rarely talked about. Glenn Close doesn't do much TV and she stayed on for 5 seasons - that says something. Rose Byrne was great as well.
Marcella,I'm kinda surprised Toast of London and Bored to Death weren't bigger.
Marcella,"Braindead sort of came and went without much fanfare, its a shame it only got 1 season but as a self contained story i think its one of my favourite shows to rewatch. Incredibly smart & funny with a great cast."
Marcella,"Nirvanna the band the show, Canadian mockumentary show, very funny with tons of 90's references."
Marcella,Halt and Catch Fire. By the end it was Mad Men-level character drama.
Marcella,"Penny Dreadful definitely! The production, costumes, acting... Everything was top notch imho"
Marcella,"bored to death, if this show is showing this day it would be a hit."
Marcella,"Wrecked - about a group of people who were shipwrecked on an Island, it was hilarious and was cancelled after three seasons, total bummer."
Marcella,The Other Two on Comedy Central.
Marcella,[deleted]
Marcella,"Crazy Ex-Girlfriend. Every season was award-worthy, the musical numbers were always fresh and incredibly well written, but it was a CW show so no one saw it (it's on Netflix though, watch it!)."

Toast of London,"Steven Toast is one of London's greatest **high winds actors**, so needless to say I am excited."
Toast of London,Matt Berry has got to the most beloved actor in British comedy. He works *so* much. The guy must be loads of fun to be around because it seems everybody wants to book him.

Toast of London,Never seen this but that actor is brilliant. What we do in the shadows never fails to make me laugh
Toast of London,"I watched 3 episodes a few years ago and gave up. Does the show get significantly better, or just not for me? I found it boring and not funny at all."
Toast of London,"And I know exactly how he's going to get there.

Toast of London,"Zaphod was American, they cast the actual film really well, they just adapted the story terribly. Matt would not make a great Zaphod."

In itself, ""Scramble"" could be a great stand-alone show. You got to meet a couple of the other ""regulars"" in Toast, and there must be other ""customers"". If that happens, I want a royalty for the idea 😂."
Toast of London,"What I want is Toast to arrive in LA after burning every bridge in London and connecting with eccentric agent Jane Plow, Jane Plough's American cousin. lacking funds and accommodation, Plow finds Toast a place to stay as room mate to rising soap opera star: Clem H Fandango.

En Immersion,Looks great! Any idea where best to watch it?

But I added it to my list. Sounds cool!"

En Immersion,I don't think that's the same show. I just found it on Prime.
En Immersion,I suspected. Thank you!
Midnight Diner,Season 1 on Netflix is actually season 4 plus 2 movies. The Japanese name for the series is Shinya shokudo.
Midnight Diner,I too would love to have more on Netflix. They make for great casual viewing.
Midnight Diner,Download the subtitels you want and add them manualky to the video you want using vlc media player
Midnight Diner,They can be found streaming on a site called dramacool.io or .bz.  Search for Shinya Shokudo
Midnight Diner,[deleted]
Midnight Diner,"I'm curious if you know. Is it ok to watch from the ""season 1"" on netflix first? Or would you recommend going back and finding the original Season 1 of Shinya shokudo online and watching from there?"
Midnight Diner,Thanks for the try. Just went there. Looks like both are down. :(
Midnight Diner,Watching them is like eating a hot bowl of ramen. So wholesome.
Midnight Diner,The series introduces characters from season 1 and you get to know their background and some are still around in season 4. Up to you on how you feel about such things.
Midnight Diner,"[http://dramacool.bz/drama/shinya-shokudo-season-1.html](http://dramacool.bz/drama/shinya-shokudo-season-1.html)  


nvmd, I'm a dumbass."
Midnight Diner,"So we'd know a little more about the cleaning lady with a history that made an entrance in the last five minutes if season ""1"", and hinted to some sad shared past or lost present?

Agreed on how friendly this show is"
Midnight Diner,I thought it was gonna be like a food documentary and was quite surprised when it was what it was. Might give it a shot later on.
Midnight Diner,It's very calming to watch.  
Midnight Diner,So...what is it?
Midnight Diner,"I cannot thank you enough for this.  I just watched the first 3 episodes and this show is absolutely wonderful.  I love it so much.  I would have never even known this was on Netflix if you hadn't taken the time to share it with us here, so again, thank you so much!"
Midnight Diner,I hope there's a season two happening. 
Midnight Diner,Is this just Netflix streaming Shinya Shokudô in english?  It was a great series to watch in Japanese and I'd love to see new episodes.
Midnight Diner,"Me too, finally sat down and watched a handful of episodes on sunday night. Very fun, and calming. I wish I had a restaurant like that to go to."
Midnight Diner,The film is pretty good as well.
Midnight Diner,This show is amazing
Midnight Diner,"I just watched the 1st three episodes and I can only say it's a must watch.  I absolutely love this show, it's wonderful."
Midnight Diner,[deleted]
Midnight Diner,Perfect way to describe it
Midnight Diner,"I just watched the first 3 episodes and it's a series of stories set in a small Tokyo restaurant, with different characters each episode, except the master who runs the place.  It is like a collection of short stories, and each is about a different set of people and situations.  

I love this show, it's wonderful, relaxing, calm, emotional, sweet, funny... I highly recommend it!"
Midnight Diner,No problem. Glad you liked it.
Midnight Diner,I think this might be season 4.  Season 1-3 are fan subbed.
Midnight Diner,"Yes, but Netflix only has the one season; no new episodes."
Midnight Diner,It's subtitled on Netflix for me in the US.
Midnight Diner,"Where have you watched the movie? I can't even seem to find much info about it online, but would be so interested in watching it! I loved the series"
Midnight Diner,"Actually,  there's 3 seasons for this show already. It's not on Netflix but you can find subbed ep under the name shinya shokudo. "
Midnight Diner,"have you been able to find them online? I have no clue on where to find them, I find too little info."
Midnight Diner,[deleted]
Midnight Diner,Yes pls give us the rest of the seasons. I also really like samurai gourmet but that was cancelled too!
Midnight Diner,"The season on Netflix was the last one?

I liked the show. It is simple and fun to watch.

I assume some Japanese channel. From what I can tell, it is not so much a Netflix Original as it is a show allowed to be shown on Netflix to the international audience. If I can recall."
Midnight Diner,You could message Netflix and ask for more. Couldn't hurt to let them know if nothing else. 
Midnight Diner,Couldnt get past Ep 1. Might try later.
Midnight Diner,The description reminds me of that anime bartender. I'll give it a shot 
Midnight Diner,It's a comforting show to watch when I want to slow down and focus on simple but wholesome. I hope there's more episodes planned.
Midnight Diner,So what's the word on this getting a second season? Or did they adapt all of the source material already?
Midnight Diner,"The protagonist is very Spike Speigel. The dialogue is fine for me, it's written like good anime. Ellis writes comic books, great comic books, so there's that. 

What I really like about the show is it establishes a really good world. It has some good depth. It feels like it's going to be epic. 

By the way, if you like this maybe try Claymore (on Hulu and other anime sites), it's the first show I thought of when I finished the season. There are a lot of anime similar in tone to this show.

I'm looking forward to season 2, I'm ok with 4 episodes making up basically a single normal length movie. "
Midnight Diner,I really enjoyed it. The intro was great at establishing Dracula's motive for what he is doing. I was hoping the series would have been longer or at least the episodes themselves.
Midnight Diner,"I watched a review by James Rolfe aka The Angry Video Game Nerd, and one of the things he said I felt was spot on was that the first season seemed very unbalanced.  The entire first episode is centered on Dracula.  Just watching that episode, it seems like the show has very little to do with the Castlevania franchise and is more a show about Dracula in general.  The rest of the season focuses on Trevor Belmont, and we don't see Drac at all. It would have been nice to see better balance between the antagonist and protagonist in the show.  Also, as you've already mentioned, the music wasn't great.  If the show is supposed to be based on Castlevania III: Dracula's Curse, it would have been nice to hear some of the music that was in that game.  I'm not asking for the midi representations just like the game, but orchestral pieces could have helped to give the show a familiar tone.  Overall, I like where the show is heading and I think the show could be quite good if the creators make a few changes and continue down the path the seem to be heading in."
Midnight Diner,"I thought the monsters were fine, especially since they technically haven't even gone into Dracula's castle yet."
Midnight Diner,"> Forgettable Music:

As a fan, I agree.  However, I can't help but wonder if non-fans even think twice about the music.  It's not memorable, but I wouldn't call it bad either.  I'm too biased to be able to objectively judge the music, because I'm comparing it to the enormous selection of excellent music from the game series.

> Lame Dialog:

I'm hoping the dialogue was strained by a need to set things up, and that now that we've established characters and goals, it will get better.  IMO, the dialogue was at it's best when the main characters were interacting, and worse when supporting characters were giving exposition, and I'm hoping for more of the former going forward. 

> Lame Monsters:

I hoping , [Spoiler](#s ""Now that we're actually on a quest to fight monsters, rather than corrupt church members and guards""), that S2 will have better monsters.    [spoiler](#s ""Really in S1 we only fought monsters at the end of E4, and Trevor was fighting humans the rest of the time, so I didn't really have time to notice the lame monster selection.  The Cyclops would be an exception to this, and he was alright, and even straight out of the game, although he had an eyebeam not a hammer in the show"")

> Okay Fight Scenes

While none were ""best animated fight ever"" quality, or even close, I liked what I saw. If the show follows even a moderate upward trend in quality as it progresses, I'll feel I'll enjoy the show thoroughly.  I'm letting my excitement (and perhaps nostalgia) get the best of me, and eagerly awaiting more."
Midnight Diner,"That seems okay, then.

If they do Double Dragon, can it not be like the shitty cartoon from the early-mid 90s?"
Midnight Diner,He is looking at them
Midnight Diner,"I remember playing Castlevania III on the NES back in the day.  I recall you had the option to play as Alucard, which was pretty cool.  Is he in the show?"
Midnight Diner,"> The protagonist is very Spike Speigel.

Considering an early pitch of the show for the show was to basically [take the characters from Cowboy bebop and plop them into the world of Berserk](https://youtu.be/MwLJ4xHMNgU?t=7m29s), it makes sense how you'd get that out of the protagonist."
Midnight Diner,I totally forgot to add this in the original post but Netflix already confirmed that for season two the episodes will be at like double the length.
Midnight Diner,"I was sad that they used a generic monster to kill the Bishop, that would have been a great scene for some of the most iconic ones"
Midnight Diner,"

We are DOUBLE DRAGON. "
Midnight Diner,"[Mild Spoiler](#s ""Yes, he shows up in a few scenes. Plus it sets him up to be more prominent going forward."")"
Midnight Diner,Double the length and twice as many?  That's even better.
Midnight Diner,"Ahh, thats great news! It felt like an introduction to the beginning of the series. I think I shall watch it all again while I clean up before the weekend starts."
Midnight Diner,I just noticed your username.  I'd buy the shit out of ringside seats for that fight.
Midnight Diner,Going to check this out tomorrow mostly because Jeremy Allen White is a underrated actor. Glad he’s leading his own show.
Midnight Diner,I never realized it but there's a real lack of scripted restaurant dramas.
Midnight Diner,"Lip in another Chicago show. I'll give it a shot.

E: Chris from Love too."
Midnight Diner,It is not named *Da Bear.* I must boycott.
Midnight Diner,"This article falsely calls the Italian Beef a ‘humble sandwich’.

Blasphemy; the Italian Beef is a grease drenched masterpiece. A spicy or sweet piece of nirvana. A sandwich worthy of a chefs kiss and various stereotypical Italian hand gestures.

Cheese or no cheese, dipped or undipped… simply magnifico."
Midnight Diner,"Show reminds me of Rescue Me. Frenetic, I love it."
Midnight Diner,He’s a good actor so I’ll check it out
Midnight Diner,"I liked it a lot, for the most part, Ayo Edebiri seems to be overacting some scenes, I guess you'd say? the only way I can explain it,  something with her facial expressions is bothering me (nitpicky I know) Her character is a bit too perfect, at least in the 3 episodes I've watched, not sure I believe her drive is this strong to want to work at a sandwich shop, particularly that one and with her skill level clearly being high, maybe things flush out more as to why she's there beside her dad liked the food and Matty being a chef IRL being made into comic relief/ handyman is interesting, but he's a pretty funny guy so it can work, it's a solid 7."
Midnight Diner,Opening with Refused - New Noise grabbed my attention straight away. Hopefully it holds up.
Midnight Diner,I’m gonna check it out but the small amount of beef he puts into the sandwich in the trailer makes me think this is another Chicago show made by people not from Chicago.
Midnight Diner,Looking forward to this.
Midnight Diner,Trailer: https://youtu.be/iN9Yu9lrssg
Midnight Diner,"Huh, this actually looks kinda great. Definitely watching this."
Midnight Diner,Disappointed this isn't a show about Saul Berenson...
Midnight Diner,When is it coming to the UK?
Midnight Diner,"Have to agree he was fantastic when he was in Shameless, my pick as the best actor of the Gallagher kids on the show. Really hope he can catch a real break and secure more roles because he really is a very talented actor."
Midnight Diner,+ Matty Matteson!
Midnight Diner,"It is absolutely 🤌

Especially if you’ve had kitchen experience, but even more so if you haven’t and you’re interested in what the kitchen life is actually like. My kitchen thinks of this show as the new Kitchen Confidential by Anthony Bourdain, albeit fictional."
Midnight Diner,"There is this family owned chinese buffet in my town, probably not that unusual.  It's been around a long time.  It may have been a couple different families, maybe related.  It was all multi-generational.  The kids were always around helping at the restaurant.  They all went to the public school in town.  Sometimes I'd see them working on their homework while I ate dinner.

I always thought a story inspired by them would make for an interesting TV show.  It would be like this meld of Chinese culture, kids growing up in the west, running a chinese buffet day-to-day, daily home life, school life, etc.

I guess it would be a bit like Bob's Burgers, but a chinese buffet, live action, and not a comedy.  

Kim's Convenience might have some similar vibes, except it's it's about Korean-Canadians and set in a convenience store."
Midnight Diner,Sweetbitter was wondrous and ended too soon
Midnight Diner,Whites is very very good!
Midnight Diner,"After *Chef* I've been dying for one. I fast forwarded through the first ep today to check out different scenes and it definitly seems to focus on food and the beauty of cooking. Also, I'm excited to see actual chef/restauranteur Matty Matheson in the show."
Midnight Diner,There was a very lame one a few years ago starring David Schwimmer called Feed the Beast. It was a remake of a Danish show I can only assume was substantially better.
Midnight Diner,Did you watch boiling point? I know it’s a film but god damn that was intense
Midnight Diner,Midnight Diner is a good one.
Midnight Diner,I loved Whites with Alan Davies
Midnight Diner,"I still remember that show The Beast, with that guy from Friends and that cute British actor playing his irresponsible brother, and they were trying to run a restaurant in Brooklyn or something."
Midnight Diner,Well one guy (Richie) does have a Chicago accent though
Midnight Diner,Honestly this show made me really want a sandwich like that.
Midnight Diner,"God, that’s what it was! I watched the first episode and I was wondering why I had this nostalgic sense of panic and dread watching the main character be a good guy and a total fuckup simultaneously. Total Rescue Me vibes now that you say it."
Midnight Diner,Get where you’re coming from but it’s a sous chef position under a James Beard winning chef even if you don’t buy her family connection making her want to work there. And I never had her credentials but I thought about working under a respected chef who was running a humble joint after he quit fine dining work.
Midnight Diner,"> not sure I believe her drive is this strong to want to work at a sandwich shop

She wants to work for Carmen, he made her favorite plate of food she’s ever eaten. It’s right in the show."
Midnight Diner,"I agree wholeheartedly. In general, most of the cast over acts pretty badly. I’m a film editor, and super sensitive to it, my instincts tell me to look for a different take all the time, lol. New drinking game, take a shot every time someone says “chef”. Do real kitchens do that? So pretentious if they do."
Midnight Diner,"If you watched the trailer it's obvious that he comes from a fine dining background and in that scene he changed it up to be more upscale, which is why the black chef said it was redundant and white"
Midnight Diner,"TIL Italian beefs are a Chicago thing

I thought they were everywhere"
Midnight Diner,Get him and the older son from Righteous Gemstones to play brothers.
Midnight Diner,"Eddie Huang had a show on one of the networks that was on a similar tangent - Fresh Off The Boat. 

However, his dad owned an American steakhouse to fit in in America."
Midnight Diner,Next on my list!
Midnight Diner,Gentefied
Midnight Diner,"The Bear is literally miles and galaxies away from Feed The Beast. So so so much better. I’m in love with restaurant dramas, Sweetbitter hit the spot for me, but FtB was truly so lame. So much wasted potential with the actors. Happy to report The Bear is better than both of them."
Midnight Diner,"I feel differently after finishing the show, she grew on me more and of course thing's get flushed out. Acting wise she may be the least talented but it's a minor knock I think the other's in the show are just so good it shined a little light on her. But I love the show regardless."
Midnight Diner,Yes I think this makes sense. It’s not often she would get a chance to work with a chef like Carmy and she wants to learn from him.
Midnight Diner,"Tons of kitchens do, in one way or the other. A place like this likely wouldn’t, which is why they show reactions to it in the first few episodes. It’s usually the higher end places that use the fancy style shows of respect.

I’ve been in kitchens for 16 years now, each one is different. It also helps chemistry for the team, while also reminding them of expectations. But for some places that sort of right consistency isn’t needed, maybe they’ll use sir or ma’am instead."
Midnight Diner,"I’m in Florida, where can I get one of those sandwiches"
Midnight Diner,"If you’re talking about Skyler Gisondo, this is actually a great idea. Both dudes are terrific actors who can play “burdened” very well. And they kinda look alike!"

Little Forest,"I’m gonna try to link it here but Tony Gilroy addressed what you’re talking about and why he chose to make the episodes slower even when Disney pushed back and wanted him to make the 1st episodes more “exciting”.

[Tony Gilroy Interview](https://i.redd.it/tony-gilroy-addresses-the-people-that-call-andor-slow-and-v0-mevhg1hfbf2a1.jpg?auto=webp&s=6ed5bb6c9896cef10c9f2a4e105a76cb7debefb1)

Its absolutely the right move here especially cause we know the fate of this character and we need to be invested in the character and not the plot.  We know the plot.   

We’ve been so conditioned with shows recently both SW and Marvel and really everything else that we should want plot first Big Bang right out of the first episode then character later.  To flip that and put character first is so refreshening.  It could only happen in SW shows like this because of its built in audience.  If most shows these days started like Andor started people would tune out and not push through and that would be the end of the show."
Little Forest,"I am not calling it the most fun Star Wars can be, but it is the most moving, most thought provoking, most layered, well acted Star Wars has ever been. I have thought and watched more on it than any show this year. It did not engage you. It happens."
Little Forest,"I finished last night and I loved it.  Cass's journey was epic over one season.  The fact that the whole prison storyline even took place within a season is amazing to me.  This is one of my favorite shows of the last five years solely for the fact that it exposed so much more every day life within the star wars universe.  Seeing coruscant, ferrix, and aldhani culture was amazing and add in the fact it was attached to what I consider a damn good story is the icing on the cake."
Little Forest,"The fact you think rise of Skywalker is better than last jedi kinda says all you need to know

EDIT: Rian Johnson didn't kill your childhood and he made a pretty solid movie with the only shred of originality that the Disney movies have pumped out"
Little Forest,I’m sorry you had this experience. It’s OK to have different reactions to art.
Little Forest,"It is hard for me to imagine being so into Star Wars and not liking Andor… it is so much more multidimensional and thought provoking than it’s predecessors. To me it is Star Wars for adults. While past Star Wars toys with the notion that things aren’t always so black and white - Andor approaches the topic head on. 

For a prequel show where the MC and several others have plot armor, they insert constant tension. Luthen is already a top 10 Star Wars character to me and he could climb even higher. I’m already hoping for a triple prequel Luthen backstory series."
Little Forest,"It's okay that you didn't like it. It's absolutely a masterpiece compared to everything else Disney has offered for the Star Wars franchise, but that doesn't mean everyone has to enjoy it. I worked with a guy years ago whose favorite movie was Michael Bay's Transformers. He didn't care that it was objectively dumb because it was fun. Maybe you just prefer a fun viewing experience to a well-crafted and layered story. No shame in that. 

Although i will say when I hear people complain that it's boring, I wonder if they were even paying attention. Without giving away context for spoilers, you have a double homicide, a failed capture by authorities, a 'bank' heist, thieves double crossing each other, a prison break, and a clash between authorities and an oppressed group. I guess it needed a lightsaber fight to have some action?"
Little Forest,This isn’t a Star Wars show. It’s a great show that happens to be set in the Star Wars Universe.
Little Forest,"If you’re someone who thinks The Last Jedi is the ***only*** other bad Star Wars media, I don’t think Andor is the problem here lol"
Little Forest,"Nothing happened to Mon Mothma?  She committed her daughter to the same horrible life that she has?  For Mothma everything happened!  We learn about her as a character and not just as someone who showed up one time in New Hope.

Also my best part of reading your post was that you found the show boring with the exception of the prison break, Mothma and the finale.  So you basically disliked half the show only?  I guess you kind of missed the point of jab jab uppercut that the writer was going for.

Look man if it's not your speed that's ok.  There's plenty of low hanging fruit in the star wars lore to enjoy.  Slow chase scenes through forests, cartoonist escapes from imperial facilities, characters that are never given any sort of motivation for their actions.  So enjoy what you will, but Andor is quite possibly the greatest star wars has been in quite a long time.  Clone wars is 7 seasons just to build to the incredible ending of the Siege of Mandalore."
Little Forest,"I stopped reading after they claimed the last Jedi was the *only* other SW project the disliked and said it was the worst film.  Sure I wasn’t crazy about everything they did in that movie but it’s definitely *not* worse than the utter garbage that was Rise of Skywalker and Attack of the Clones.  On the tv show side Book of Boba Fett was an absolute dumpster fire and made me actually *dislike* a character I’ve loved since I was 5 years old.

What I’m getting at is, while everyone is entitled to their own opinion, OP has terrible taste."
Little Forest,Is Reddit’s homepage sorting by controversial now or something? Feels like hot take r/television posts keep popping up at the top for me.
Little Forest,Bro wanted marvel cameos
Little Forest, The stuff OP complains about is why we got stupid chase scenes in Obi-Wan and Boba fett that didn’t lead anywhere or develop the plot….
Little Forest,If you didn’t like it after ep 3 then why continue lol
Little Forest,Lost me at its boring.  Sorry.
Little Forest,"Lots of people like crazy action sequences with no depth type shows. Some of the most popular TV is reality TV, some of the highest grossing movies are about people driving fast cars with dumb stunts. There's nothing wrong with enjoying action packed stuff. 

Andor is not that. It's a show that shows the delicate balance when being a spy. It shows the horrors of fascism and how it warps those who think they are the heroes into committing horrible acts. It's a spy show with quiet deceit, careful planning, and flawed execution. About why people rebel, and why those who ferment rebellion are grey and can sometimes be the villain. How even those who commit atrocities can love and are at their hearts human.

If you can't appreciate that, I honestly feel a little bad, because it's very beautiful. Star Wars the originals always had a tight rope to walk, because it's action packed, but there are deeper stories to be told. Sons trying to heal father's wounds, fear leading you to bring about your doom. 

Honestly though, if you watched the prequels and sequels and thought ""these are good moves"" I can't take anything you say seriously. The prequels are dumpster fires of movie making. The dialogue is horrendous, and the acting worse. There's so much useless fluff (which appeals to children, the way cocomelon is dumb garbage, but kids love it). The sequels have no plot that makes any sense, and TRoS is the worst of them because it rewrites the entire point of the original trilogy. 

So to cap off my long thing, that's fine you didn't like it, but I would try to broaden your horizons a bit. There's lots of deep slow pacing things that don't hit your dopamine receptors, but are worth it to savor."
Little Forest," I’m a lifelong SW fan, and at 47, it means I’ve consumed all the movies in theaters in real time. Learning to adapt to the new world order with so much new and mostly good content takes so much time. As a result, I’ve “picked and choosed” my way through all these limited series. 

With that as a brief context, I loved everything about Andor. The pacing, the cinematic quality. It felt so right to me. I binged watched over a vacation, staying up until 2 am and 3 am on consecutive nights. 

I totally understand how people would assess this as slow. Many of my good friends with common tastes to mine lost interest before finishing it. For me, Andor is the Godfather 1 of the SW universe. Just perfect."
Little Forest,Here for my obligatory downvote… OP missed the mark on this one
Little Forest,"It’s human drama in the Star Wars Universe.  It’s not trench runs or lightsabers or pod races.  I LOVE those things.  But I also enjoy HBO dramas about real people dealing with real problems.  I like understanding the actual human motivation to rebel against a totalitarian state.  You kinda have to let go of Star Wars to appreciate the show, but then realize how much the show actually enhances the Star Wars franchise that we love.  It’s a big universe with lots of stories."
Little Forest,[removed]
Little Forest,"It’s certainly much less an action centered show than other Star Wars shows tend to be, I’ll give you that. If you’re just not into drama and characters, I can see how you would be bored. To me it has a more GoT pace and style, multiple interconnected characters and sub-plots. If you understand why that style wildly popular, maybe you can see why other people would find Andor a good show, even if it didn’t resonate with you."
Little Forest,"Your they type to enjoy *Goodfellas*, but wouldn’t be able to sit through *The Godfather*. I don’t say this to in a bad way. All I’m saying is there’s a certain type of show that you enjoy, but *Andor* ain’t it."
Little Forest,"Understandable that it wasn’t your cup of tea - it seems like you prefer driving action tempo, and Andor was not that.  As an older person, there were A LOT of the more mundane elements that resonated deeply with me, and those may not have resonated with a younger person who hasn’t experienced the cruel judgement of a loving parent, the the mundanity of bureaucracy stifling a burning passion, the oppression of a self serving and corrupt boss, and so many other elements.  All good."
Little Forest,Lmao of course someone who hates TLJ dislikes the best Star Wars media since TLJ came out.
Little Forest,"It's ok if you don't like good shows, to each their own"
Little Forest,"They set the show up to be similar to how TCW did things, with 3 episode arcs. That’s why it was very up and down. It was definitely slow but had some of the best character development in the universe in my opinion. Episodes 4-6 in Aldhani were excellent because it was really showing Andor start to get with the Rebellion. 

They pretty much had to set up a whole new universe because Star Wars fans expect to see Bounty Hunters, Lightsabers, and the Force in everything. I love how they are expanding to non-force storylines. 

Also the best part of Andor was definitely the prison break. But I think that is great for more than just Serkis and his amazing acting. You can see that he was scared to escape because I think he knew all along he was not gonna be able to escape. And that sacrifice builds the entire character arc of Andor willing to sacrifice himself in Rogue One. 

This was far and away the best material SW has released in a while. Happy new year!"
Little Forest,"I mean some people like Ewoks and Jar Jar. To each their own. I vehemently disagree with OP, but it's fine that's his opinion."
Little Forest,"Nah, OP. Andor was subtle mature and awesome. I get it that you like space wizards more but Andor is for people looking for a deeper story in StarWars."
Little Forest,"I think the main issue is how you ended up watching the show.  If you already knew what was going to happen in episodes 1-5, I can see it being a slog to get through.  But on the first watch, if you’re not over-tired, the show was gripping.  No surprise that the better episodes for you were when you were watching it for the first time.  First show in a LONG time that I looked forward to watching every week."
Little Forest,"I can understand why some would find it slow and boring, and at times it was definitely slow, but I think that is because we came from a lens of previous Star Wars content. Star Wars doesn't need to be fast and exciting in every piece of content, but since most of the content is fast and exciting we expect all Star Wars content to be as such and we find it weird when it is not. 

Personally, I enjoyed the change of pace and mindset."
Little Forest,"There’s always going to be a better or worse character developed line. I’m just happy as a pig in mud that they are making multiple derivative character shows that I am entirely ok with it not being “The Best”. You’ve got the single episode excitement with Mando, you’ve got some character background on Kenobi, I liked Fett, think it needed some more work - but really - we have more episodes and movies, and that’s awesome. Go at it open minded, and you won’t be let down."
Little Forest,Idk if this will be buried but was anyone intrigued by the manifesto ? I would love to read it fully or a version of it
Little Forest,Slower is better for me. I like to live in a world and see how it functions. What comes to mind is The Assassination of Jesse James. It’s a Western that lets you feel what it’s like to live in the world.
Little Forest,"Thanks for giving it a watch, at least.  I guess I'm more of a worldbuilding and character-driven fan.  I don't need or want SW to be all about action sequences.  Although when they happened (much more rarely than with other SW series) it made me enjoy them all the more."
Little Forest,"I watched the entire season in one day. I was hooked. I might watch it again. I think your too used to action movies and shows. We all have our tastes, personally I'm not a huge action fan. I like shows like andor. Where you can discuss the characters, their motivations, and where they come from. Every character is well done. There isn't a single character that didn't do a good job. Which is surprising. Also, you may notike it. But, star wars needed a show like this. It finally introduced new characters instead of using cameos. Star wars ip was/is on life support. Merchandise sales are down, and Disney has ruined the ip. Andor is bringing it back slowly. It won't have everything people want. But that's fine. We shouldn't try and have shows that cater to every demographic. That's why we got awful movies and shows that are too spread out. Obi wan was a travesty. And mandalorian was a good show in what it offered. But it didn't introduce too many characters. We'll see more shows with good action. I hope they make some shows in the high republix. That will be good sith vs Jedi."
Little Forest,"You're inability to enjoy Andor for what it is and your dislike of The Last Jedi are linked here, I think."
Little Forest,Star Wars is only relevant because of fan service. Andor was refreshing to me because it did its job not relying on fan service too much.
Little Forest,Can I get your opinion on Kenobi?
Little Forest,"I think it’s important to understand that this show was not meant to follow the blueprint of how the movies were written and filmed. This show effectively expressed the sacrifices that humans make during times of suppression and violence from cynical and authoritarian governments like the republic. I feel like it was beautifully presented, but if you didn’t feel the same then to each their own. I like hearing how each person does or does not like a specific TV show or movie because that’s the beauty of free speech. Hope you find a show you like!"
Little Forest,"That's unfortunate. This is probably the most negative review I've seen given to Andor. The pacing was something I personally enjoyed very much. I do agree that it wasn't perfect, but for me the maturity of the series is way beyond the movies and also any if the series, which I personally like non of, besides mentioned Andor."
Little Forest,"I wasn't enjoying Andor until I decided to ignore it's a Star Wars tv show. As soon as I started to consider the show as a political drama that tells its own story independent from the franchise, that's when Andor became an amazing series. Now I can't wait for a second season."
Little Forest,Everyone who didn’t like the show is rightwing politically. Only half joking.
Little Forest,Slow buildup and increased exposition is my personal favorite characteristic of a TV show or movie. This just wasn’t for you
Little Forest,"You have bad taste, man. Sorry."
Little Forest,It's the best written Star Wars project. Hands down. I'll die on this hill. Fight me.
Little Forest,Best Star Wars series so far. It’s a masterpiece. It’s been a literal war in the stars.
Little Forest,"Possess bad taste you do

Grow up you must"
Little Forest,"It’s possible you were disappointed that there were no light sabers (clone wars, obi wan, etc), no using the force (prequels, sequels) or baby yodas.   I’m not being sarcastic.  I think some fans find extracting creativity from the original source to be fun and nostalgic.  Unfortunately for me, I find it very unimaginative and it made the prequels and sequels very painful to watch.  This is why I loved rogue one and Andor bc they truly went beyond the source material.  Andor did even less recycling and completely built intricacies of the Star Wars world we never could appreciate.  What did it feel like working under the empire?  The actual feeling of oppression in your day to day life?  Sure blowing up planets is threatening but it’s distant and abstract.  Also to see the rebellion as a secretive ragtag group of misfits is a completely different angle from all other films, except perhaps the early portrayal of Han Solo in New Hope.    

Andor also has a powerful and sharp script with flawless acting (the acting in Obi Wan was awful).  The storyline is brilliant on a whole different level because they pace it and build their characters."
Little Forest,"I totally agree. Relative to other recent Star Wars series, it’s really good. Relative to other really good television, it’s meh."
Little Forest,"Well this may be the last opinion of 2022 we didnt ask for, so thank you"
Little Forest,Glad you got that off your chest.
Little Forest,"You’re entitled to your opinion. It’s wrong, but you’re entitled to it"
Little Forest,Disagree. Andor is SW world building at its finest. So much depth in each episode. Love the drama and intrigue and conspiracy. So glad the flashy stuff is toned down/nonexistent in this series.
Little Forest,OP is gonna get downvoted for just expressing his opinion. I watched the first 3 episodes and it really did bore me and feel like a chore to get through. Haven’t touched it since. Idk just didnt catch my attention or have me interested enough which is weird bc usually the Star Wars universe alone is enough to get me to watch something.
Little Forest,Boooooooooooo
Little Forest,I’m still fighting against myself to get through it. I’ve seen five episodes so far and every single one has felt like it’s dragging as badly as the Hobbit movies or Avatar did for me. It’s a slog and I don’t see myself finishing. It’s been so boring. Nothing about it has pulled me in yet.
Little Forest,"It is boring, don't worry, you're not alone. Should have just left it at Rogue one, which is arguably the best star wars movie"
Little Forest,Completely AGREE with you
Little Forest,Congratulations.  I couldn't make it through 2 episodes
Little Forest,Go watch Book of Boba Fett and jerk off to soulless Star Wars nostalgia instead
Little Forest,My gf and I watched the whole thing twice. It is a masterpiece
Little Forest,When all you eat is mcdonald’s I guess a nice steak is boring
Little Forest,"HARD AGREE. It was mostly boring and I didn’t care about any of the characters or what happened to them! So confused by everyone saying how great it was! I am not a huge Star Wars fan, but I did watch all of the Star Wars spin-offs that have been coming out lately and enjoyed them. This one was a dud, I’m not sure why."
Little Forest,"I agree OP but this sub does not embrace debate or dissenters. You either buy what the mouse is selling or you’re downvoted into oblivion.

Can’t wait for the next ‘DAE think The Last Jedi was the greatest of the sequel trilogy???’ thread."
Little Forest,"Haven't made it through episode 2. Thanks for the review,  I won't waste my time because I was feeling the same way about it."
Little Forest,Even Stoppard couldn’t save the dialogue in Revenge of the Sith.
Little Forest,"Pointing out that the boring show Andor was boring isn’t tolerated here. 

Don’t worry most people outside Reddit agree with you which is why it was the lowest rated Disney+ Star Wars project to date."
Little Forest,Me too
Little Forest,"You just have bad taste theres nothing wrong with that. Thats why shitty movies exist because there’s someone out there that will watch them.

Mon mothma plot was important and things *did* happen. This is how we see her begin to fund the rebellion and navigate the political side without making noise that would alert the ISB/Empire. We see the relationship she has to keep with her husband to remain inconspicuous, the parties she has to throw in coruscant, the political allies she keeps, and sacrifices she has to make (courting her daughter as part of a deal) to ensure she has the support she needs."
Little Forest,"Agreed, shit was slow as hell"
Little Forest,"Yes, lifelong SW fan here as well.  The Last Jedi was the worst and Andor was an arduous task to get through"
Little Forest,Every thing you said word for word is on the dot with how I feel about this show. Ironically I’m enjoying the Willow series more despite its many issues.
Little Forest,It’s wild to me that someone can enjoy any of the Disney Star Wars content outside of Rogue One and then actively dislike Andor. To each their own though
Little Forest,"I felt like I was in an abusive relationship with Andor. Every episode, I kept watching in the hopes that SOMETHING happened that was interesting. It was a series of unnecessary slow burn. It did a lot of world building when it didn't need to. You could have accomplished what happened in Andor in 4 episodes. You didn't need 12 episodes of build and build and build. I feel that scene where Luthen Rael gets into an engagement with the empire during a small space battle was thrown in there due to the complaining of lack of ANYTHING of substance happening.  


I usually give a new series an entire season before I pass judgement. This series was boring, and pretentious. I am a die hard Star Wars fan, and I found myself having to stop mid way through episodes to do something else because they were so boring and I was falling asleep. I will not be tuning into season 2, which I'm sure an announcement for such is inevitable. I'm not saying that there has to be constant action, but there are ways to build a political spy drama that pushes the narrative at a nice clip so the viewer doesn't feel disengaged. I felt like I could watch C-SPAN's house floor feed for 24hrs and gleam more entertainment than I would have from watching Andor."
Little Forest,"Not going to lie, this post sounds like baiting.

Yeah, I can believe there's a person who doesn't like Andor. The pacing is... some people would call it ""grownup"", but that would imply fast pacing is bad. Andor isn't slow per se, but it's not mindlessly fast either.

However, TS also added ""The only other SW project I disliked was the last jedi"". I'm not even talking about blatantly bad stuff like Kenobi, but pacing-wise, Andor's NOT the biggest offender.

If they're not lying - that might just be a twitter journalist baiting people for ""hateful fans"" material."
Little Forest,"I agree with you, It's boring as shit, I watched 3 episodes, forced myself to watch the 4th one and that was it, every character was bland/boring/uninteresting, no one's motive was gripping or suspenseful in any way."
Little Forest,">The only other SW project I disliked was the last jedi (which I view as the worst movie in the franchise)

If you liked TRoS, that certainly explains why Andor wasn't for you. Andor is a thoughtful, character-driven drama. TRoS is not.

You can't condense or skip over the heist prep work. Getting to know each individual is important because they all represent the different ways people come to and interact with the rebellion."
Little Forest,I have to agree I thought it was extremely boring with so many useless story lines and characters I struggled to finish it. I could’ve cared less about the empire characters and they were in the prison for too long among other things. Also I didn’t really didn’t get the full British cast I mean I don’t mind some but it was an overload with many actors that I never saw before and honestly weren’t that great of actors (the one empire lady was overly serious and not great sorry) This is the first Star Wars show or movie that I really didn’t like (I thought Rouge one and the Last Jedi were great). I’m usually not picky with shows or franchises I love but I probably won’t watch season 2.
Little Forest,"If you didn't like it then that's fine.  I enjoyed the pacing and I think it's a decent show, but it's probably overrated."
Little Forest,"Andor is definitely suited towards the more hardcore Star Wars fans that were looking for a more mature and multidimensional story, it isn’t for everyone and casual fans like yourself probably won’t fully understand and appreciate its huge and much welcomed departure from the shit that they’ve been releasing over the past several years like the ST, BOBF and kenobi"
Little Forest,"I AGREE UGH unrelenting depressing boredom. No joy, no humor for contrast, every episode is just oh look how bad the Empire is. No interesting characters. Even the bot was manipulatively “oh look he stutters and is shy so the audience WILL LOVE HIM.”"
Little Forest,totally agree. I was wondering if something was wrong with me. thank you
Little Forest,I don't understand how anyone finds this boring
Little Forest,"Yes, agreed.  I seriously think it's some sort of social experiment going on because I just can't fathom coming to any other conclusion.  We were all on the edge of our seats wondering, will Syril eat his cereal? Stay tuned for next week..."
Little Forest,I finally finished Andor and disagree with OP. It was a good show. Not revolutionary but better than a lot of what Disney has been churning out. I can see how somebody would find it slow - but I thought it was a good pace.
Little Forest,"""monkey brain bored, not enough explosions, show bad"""
Little Forest,Another example that proves opinions can indeed be wrong
Little Forest,"My feelings are 100% in line with OP. I love Star Wars. I will always give every single SW project a shot. I watched every minute of Andor and I just couldn’t engage. Some episodes were good. A few were almost great. Most left me struggling to stay awake. 

I won’t bad mouth it, but I laugh when people say it’s “the best Star Wars project”. Just because it’s different from the other Star Wars shows doesn’t make it “the best”."
Little Forest,"Have to agree, I have 2 episodes left and I can't even bring myself to finish them"
Little Forest,I liked it as a whole but I can’t help but agree with you. I had to re-watch so many episodes because I would just some out or fall asleep in every other episode.
Little Forest,A lot of bad takes there.
Little Forest,"What I found funny is that I started this show not caring about these character and at the end of the series I still don't care. It feel like Andor had more character in rogue one than he does in Andor and I guess it would be because of the time period where the empire is controlling people. 
The prison arc was good but I guess this is comparing with the slow pace that it took to get there, and it was over quick. 
My issue was also with the slow pace prequel exposition dump they put in the episodes. 
I think this is one of the ok star war show but I don't see myself rewatching it."
Little Forest,Are you 9 years old?
Little Forest,"I liked the show. My 2 biggest things are:

WHO TF ASKED FOR A SHOW ABOUT THE SHITTY GUY FROM ROGUE ONE WHO ALMOST RUINED EVERYTHING

and it is not “peak star wars” people saying “this is the best star wars has ever been”"
Little Forest,Tell me you have no taste without telling me you have no taste.
Little Forest,"I also just finished it. (Spoilers) And I agree with you. Slow and boring. I kept watching because everyone was talking about it. But the prep for the first heist was so weird. Here's this new guy that no one wants but they also didn't have a plan to fly the ship? Also they had a spare uniform in just his size? Also it looked like everyone is in groups of 4 at the facility so a group of 3 would have stood out. Details like this throughout the show made it hard to watch. 

And by the Maker, give the stormtroopers a win. What a bunch of bozos. I really thought we were going to see how scary they can be but nope. I still don't understand why that one guy working for the cops got fired and had to live with his mom. He was the only good character that I was 100% on his side. 

The Mandolorian is my favorite star wars media. I also really really enjoyed Rogue One. But this I did not enjoy. I'm with you OP."
Little Forest,It’s ok to be wrong. Happens to everyone
Little Forest,Imo Andor is heavily overrated because it's Star Wars and being a well received Star Wars property is like gold for a starved fanbase.
Billions,"I suppose this isn't entirely surprising.  The way they wrote Axe out was open-ended enough for his return, and I imagine that was intentional since he left due to his wife dying.  Presumably, the writers were always hoping he'd come back, and now he's at a point where he wants to act again.

As someone who watched the show up until his departure, I'm glad to see he's wanting to work again as Damian Lewis is a fantastic actor, but I think my interest in the show ended when he left as the show was already on a steep decline and spinning its wheels anyways.  I don't think I'll be returning when he does.  Axe repeatedly outsmarting Chuck's legal maneuvers was already getting old a few seasons back."
Billions,Even having him back this show is well past it’s best before date.
Billions,"Confirmed on *The Late Show with Stephen Colbert*! Lewis will appear as Axe for 6 out of the 12 episodes of *Billions* season 7, which will premiere later this year."
Billions,"I think Showtime should give its stars a few seasons off in the middle to load manage, we know it's going 9-11, it keeps their legs fresh"
Billions,"How the hell did this show get 7 seasons.

In my opinion the max a show could go on for without running stale is 6 seasons depending on how good and engaging the story is."
Billions,"The show was over when Paul Giamatti lost all that weight, lol."
Billions,Yes. This might just save the show. Prince might be a subtle megalomaniac but he's not a protagonist and couldn't actually play a villain role.
Billions,"And now, I'll come back to watch Billions again."
Billions,"meh, show rapidly went to arse after season 4"
Billions,"For me he was the main reason that i watched. Guess i need to catch up on that latest season without him.

Just really enjoy Giamatti and him playing off eachother."
Billions,Oh man I thought Damian Lewis legally couldn't exist in a series past Season 2
Billions,"The showrunner of this show is an incredible douchebag, he is literally milking this one to eternity, amazed people still watch it."
Billions,This is still on?
Billions,Didn't this show end?
Billions,and yet season 6 is nowhere available in Brazil
Billions,Of course he is.
Billions,[deleted]
Billions,Lame.
Billions,Whose Damian Lewis this is a picture of captain winters
Billions,Probably because Soder quit The Bonfire. Damien was inspired by his dedication to Billions
Billions,What??!!!?? Time to jump back in!
Billions,Okay great… only on season 2 🤦🏼‍♀️🤦🏼‍♀️🤦🏼‍♀️
Billions,well they announced a Millions and Trillions spin-off so I imagine they will end Billions and then send some of the characters off to those shows or at least some crossovers.
Billions,If you're a fan of Lewis you should watch A Spy Among Friends. I thought it was pretty good.
Billions,"Losing Axe was inevitable eventually, albeit the timing and *how* it eventually came about were infinitely more tragic with the death of Helen McCrory. Even though (much like another Damian Lewis series) I think *Billions* should've ended long ago, I'm glad he's coming back towards what will (hopefully) be its end. 

The introduction of Corey Stoll's Mike Prince was a solid enough remedy to losing Axe, although I think the season's overarching story and somewhat too-late criticism of billionaires left the series without a very clear sense of purpose or place; it spent too long painting its ***characters*** as flawed themselves, but doing nothing to criticize or otherwise caricature their ridiculously wealthy lives like, say, *Succession* does. More than that, it went the opposite direction, painting the Axe Capital cast of characters as universally ""cool"" (excepting 1-2 *Big Bang Theory*\-style ""nerd"" caricatures written in later); they like ""cool"" things, drive ""cool"" cars, and the entire cast speaks fluently in that *Billions*\-patented shorthand of ""cool"" references (to make you feel ""cool"" too whenever you recognize the reference), even though sometimes the dialogue feels like Sorkin's zippy *West Wing* walk-and-talk writing--but if Martin Sheen, Allison Janney, and Bradley Whitford were constantly trying to work references to Steve McQueen and Paul Newman movies into literally every exchange about foreign and domestic policy. 

I really enjoyed the Mike Prince arc of the most recent seasons, especially early on when we're as skeptical and in the dark about his goals and motives as everybody else in the cast; I wasn't a fan of the outcome, but I think at the beginning the idea of basically an anti-Axe who appears genuinely preoccupied with using his wealth and resources to improve the lives of others and his community was inspired. He couldn't replicate Lewis'/Axe's presence, so they didn't even bother trying, and somehow managed a delicate balance between slowly winning the cast (and audience, by extension) over to his character's seemingly utopian ""vision,"" while still acknowledging his god complex and major flaws as a person/husband/etc. 

That said, I think bringing Damian Lewis back has a lot of potential, but could just as easily topple things just as this new version of *Billions* had found its footing. At the very least, it will be good to see Wags' reaction. I still think the series should've ended with like, the second/third season (honestly, maybe even the first, if they'd left it a little less open-ended). Like with Lewis' time on *Homeland*, I think it could've been a phenomenal character study as a limited or even anthology series, but it's still been solidly entertaining and certainly doesn't wast such a talented cast."
Billions,"Truly.

Season 5 was already a complete re-tread.  Season 6 was just a complete waste of time.  I'm genuinely shocked they got a season 7."
Billions,It's going what sir?
Billions,Showtime will just keep milking and milking their shows until there’s literally nothing left but dust
Billions,Show ended for me after season 2. The writers just kinda lost it after that.
Billions,"I don't know if you have heard but, in addition to Season 7, Showtime is launching FOUR spinoff shows: Billions: London, Billions: Miami, Millions, and Trillions."
Billions,one word: Showtime
Billions,from what I recall they always planned to make 7 seasons
Billions,"you mean in season 2, widely considered one of the best seasons?"
Billions,it's the final season
Billions,"They are merging with Paramount+ so there is no strategy, they will cease to exist as an independent entity soon"
Billions,Showtime really knows how to beat a dead horse.
Billions,"actually excited about this, once they find a winner they churn them out like new soap operas. attention span with younger viewers i’d imagine plays a part, they’re used to endless content regardless of quality"
Billions,"And Life, Band of Brothers, maybe wolf hall."
Billions,"It might be something a casual fan wouldn't understand, but clearly u/RusevReigns is referring to the role 9/11 plays in Bobby Axelrod's backstory and the rich lore of the *Billions* universe. Understandable that this might go over your head, as to be fair, you have to have a pretty high IQ (or just a lot of spare time) to get all the references in such an intelligently written show as *Billions*.

/s"
Billions,"I think they’re saying “we know Showtime will run the show too long, 9-11 seasons, so why not give the actors a break in the middle of that?”

I enjoyed the first few seasons of Billions but it lost its mojo and I dropped Showtime"
Billions,9-11 seasons
Billions,"Showtime is the worst network outside of CBS when it comes to never letting their shows end gracefully. And they never do. They always keep going and going until Showtime just cancels them unceremoniously. 

Dexter was the closest, but that was shot in the foot because they were planning for the inevitable reboot and then the reboot was shot in the foot because they were planning for a spin-off (that now isn't going to happen.)"
Billions,I fucking burst out laughing when I saw the Yellowjackets creators touting a five season arc. They were running out of ideas at the end of *season one*
Billions,I can think of at least three showtime shows where they forced me the viewer to make the call and decide to stop watching a former favorite show of mine because it needed to be put out to pasture.
Billions,Clancy Brown even said in an interview that to cut corners they fired the writers who made season 1 what it was.
Billions,Pretty much how I felt. Chuck motherfucking rhoades
Billions,I made it to season 6 but quit half way through. The writing is horrific.
Billions,In one of the seasons there was a writers strike. I don't remember which season but it was with the one of the storylines where they poison the chipotle .
Billions,Cowardly not to do a spin off called hundreds and thousands.
Billions,Ew
Billions,People need to stop planning such long shows.
Billions,You sure about that? Thought it was last season after Lewis left.
Billions,Bummer. Can't wait for the send off then.
Billions,I think the idea is to just copy Marvel and the Sheridanverse. Whenever you strike something mildly popular keep giving people what they want.
Billions,his seasons of Homeland are good too.
Billions,"Of course, but I would assume a fan has seen these already. A Spy Among Friends is very recent."
Billions,"I enjoyed him in *Wolf Hall*, and had totally forgotten about *Life* until your comment (I think for a couple years I would either conflate or confuse *Life* with that David Duchovny series *Aquarius*, even though the premises are totally different). 

I'd also recommend *The Escapist* (plus you get Brian Cox planning a prison breakout). 

*Band of Brothers*, however, will always be peak Damian Lewis. Between that and *Billions*, I feel like he's even better when his character has a sort of partner or best friend-type to play off of."
Billions,*maybe* Wolf Hall? that show is a bomb
Billions,I thought you meant the Eddie Murphy/Martin Lawrence movie Life. I have seen that a ton of times and I couldn't picture who Damian Lewis played.
Billions,Is that like a terrorist Four Seasons?
Billions,Shameless went on wayyyy too long.
Billions,">Showtime is the worst network outside of CBS 

And now they will be one! Though I'm expecting a content purge as they consolidate."
Billions,"Wow, yeah I loved season 1, and then 2 was still pretty good and it kept getting worse after that"
Billions,I didn't know that. What a bunch of muppets. Knowing showtime they are gonna keep this running for 5 more seasons till they eventually cancel it when the writing gets even more god awful
Billions,Very reminiscent of how AMC treated The Walking Dead following a hit first season.
Billions,They already made too many seasons of Shameless.
Billions,"I mean, he lost a lot of weight from s1 to s2, Chuck starts dieting/bjj"
Billions,🎥 ⏰ 🥊 ☠️ 🐎
Billions,Good? He was Homeland. The second season interrogation episode with him and Claire Danes is the most brilliant two person scene acting among all time tv .
Billions,"The writer's room also went from a complex understanding of the worlds they were writing about to just using generic tropes about the rich. Tropes are awesome, but not when used as a replacement for knowing what you are doing."
Billions,">more seasons till they eventually cancel it when the writing gets even more god awful

you mean when viewership decreases below profitable levels, it's pretty clear at this point they don't care for quality at all"
Billions,"I meant last year, though he says he only lost 15 lbs. Maybe it was the beard change as well. Either way was trying to be funny, lol."
Billions,Brian Cox throwing shade at other shows like he doesn't give a fuck
Billions,"Brian Cox:

>“I don’t know [if there will be a fifth season]. No one’s had their contracts renewed. Who knows how long it will go on? We don’t want it to overstay its welcome, like ‘Billions’; that’s past its sell-by date. That will not happen with our show.”"
Billions,"I think the show is amazing, and the best thing on TV right now, but it really should not go on for much longer. It would soon seem like it's only running in circles for the sake of running in circles and not because of the character motivations. 

Veep, with a similar style, had similar issues. They handled it by actually changing Selina's status, which is something Succession just refuses to do. So they should just end it soon."
Billions,"I'd much rather a limited amount of seasons of brilliance (The Leftovers), than watch a show I love descend into the abyss (Dexter)."
Billions,"He could have just said ""Like every Showtime show."""
Billions,Billions without Damian Lewis isn't Billions.
Billions,"Unexpected Billions hate lol.

He’s not wrong though."
Billions,Billions is still on?
Billions,"I don't see succession running longer than the creators originally intended it to.  The story arcs have been super tight so far.  So far basically everything from previous seasons has paid off or set up larger storylines in a future season.  For example Tom and Greg working in the tourism division on season 1.  And it seems like Shiv's season 1 storyline of being a top end political consultant is going to come into play in a big way in season 4.

Also if you were a cynical person reading this, Cox could be non too subtly saying that if you kill me off in season four you better end the damn show."
Billions,first time in history Logan Roy tells billions to fuck off
Billions,"""Right. Thanks. Now quietly, Fuck Off.  ROMAN! Can someone please tell me where is my useless son? No, not that one, the Other one.  And for Christ's sake, Tom, move out of my fucking way!  Jesus..."""
Billions,"I loved billions early on but haven’t watched the 2-3 most recent seasons because it went off the rails.


That being said,  the show creators of billions have been very vocal that this is a job and if they’re going to be paid to create something, they don’t truly care about the long term reception.  Brian koppelman was on the bill Simmons podcast circa February 2018 and got asked, how many seasons he wanted to go. He said, (and this is true for most shows), he had 1 season completed for the initial pitch.  He had a 3-4 season story arc at a high level. IF the show was successful and he was fortunate to get past a pilot episode, s1, s2, etc, he had a few absurd ideas that he would like to see play out and extend the 3-4 season arc out to 6-7 seasons.  He then mentioned that if the network/studio was gracious enough to continue longer he would just throw mud on the wall and cash huge paychecks knowing that hundreds of people have benefited on 6-8 seasons of the show.  He said he couldn’t/wouldn’t go past 7-8 seasons but the money after 3-4 seasons gets so dumb with residuals and renegotiations that it’s life changing. 


So while as a viewer I am totally selfish that I want a work of art that has a very nice story arc and wraps before it jumps the shark. That being said,  a lot of the actors, and a lot of the crew, producers, writers, etc are making a good living by having the show go on as long as possible. Ideas and stories are hard to do. I am always going to side with people able to get paid for their work as the first few years are not nearly as lucrative as anything past S3-4.  If you’re a lighting guy, or audio guy, or location scout, it’s solid employment that you get to come back to each season knowing you’ve got a paycheck for 13-25 weeks of the year as long as the show goes."
Billions,"God, I love him so much. One of our best quote-givers and older actors in rare ""IDGAF about Hollywood respectability, Imma speak my mind"" form. Oh yea and he's giving a top five TV performance every year and making it look *easy*."
Billions,"Brian Cox has no filter when throwing shade. I heard parts of his autobiography is like the burn book from Mean Girls. Not saying he's wrong, as I haven't watched Billions, but it's harsh. I once heard he threatened some of his co-workers with a pistol whipping if anyone said the word ""shenanigans"" again."
Billions,"I kinda liked the latest season of Billions, but I agree the best days are behind with that show."
Billions,Oh fuck off
Billions,"I'm betting there will be 5 seasons. The first 3 were making each kid the favorite for a season (Kendall: 1, Shiv: 2, Roman: 3) but now that they're all alienated from their father I think season 4 and 5 will be them taking him down or building their own company."
Billions,"Way different shows. Billions has multiple things going on, succession is a Shakespearean family drama."
Billions,I've never even heard of Billions.
Billions,He's right. Billions lost quality when Bobby left the show. Price isn't the same villain at all. Hope they do one more season and call it a day.
Billions,"Well, I for one am still enjoying Billions, so, Brian can... wait for it... wait for it...

FUCK OFF."
Billions,"I agree, season 4 should be the end of it otherwise the Logan show would get pretty boring and season 4 would feel pointless anyway. For change to actually happen Logan must actually lose."
Billions,"It's already started, until the final episode it was same old Succession."
Billions,"Billions is still awesome, succession can kick rocks its fucking boring"
Billions,"This man threw all the shade, no fucks given lol"
Billions,"Season three ended strong I'd say, but as a whole I thought it was a pretty big step down from season two. It's unfortunately becoming a little too predictable. Kendall slowly works up the courage to take on his dad, only to be smacked down again. Rinse and repeat. I like the show and I hope it can explore new new and exciting directions in season four."
Billions,"But Succession is going in circles. The third season emulated the other two. Seasons start one way and end the same way.  It's going nowhere. The text and acting are great. The story doesn't. If it wasn't on HBO, it wouldn't have this critical acclaim."
Billions,"It was kind of eye-opening to watch the original British version of the office. Only a few seasons, extremely well written and enjoyable. I wish more American shows would go with that format, but instead the American version is to put all the money into the first season and then cram as many seasons as they can in after that with diminished returns"
The Shannara Chronicles,"I had plans to watch it but had no idea Season 2 had premiered yet, let alone finished. Their advertising for this sucked."
The Shannara Chronicles,"This was still going on? I'm not trying to be snarky, but I thought that this had been canceled after one sason. I have literally heard **nothing** about it since its premiere."
The Shannara Chronicles,"i very much liked this show but this news of it being cancelled is not surprising. when it jumped from MTV to Spike Channel, i pretty much assumed it would end up cancelled. Spike also started airing 2 eps in a row back to back each week in order to burn the eps off as fast as possible.  also (it's clear after reading the comments on this thread) Spike apparently did ZERO, NADA, ZILCH promotion for this show since no one even knew there was a second season. "
The Shannara Chronicles,"This was a dumb show, but I tried to give it a chance.  Made it all the way to the... second(?) episode where a bunch of guards were like ""Well, we are actively hunting a shapeshifter, but I recognize that guy, so he's cool!"""
The Shannara Chronicles,"good


I just wish, whenever a fantasy series is adapted, the showrunners and networks would just pay attention to the damn source material.  This is one of the reasons I hope Wheel of Time never goes into production, some dipstick will find a way to completely miss the point."
The Shannara Chronicles,"Yeah, no great loss."
The Shannara Chronicles,"Damn.

It wasn't insanely great. But it had Manu Bennett and great costumes/set designs. Sad to see it go. "
The Shannara Chronicles,"I enjoyed the show for the high fantasy setting, it felt out of place on spike  though, it should of been on the CW  it seems to fit their audience better.  Now I need to go read the book series to finish the story. "
The Shannara Chronicles,"man, i can't imagine why..."
The Shannara Chronicles,The minute it left MTV it was doomed. Not to mention they took way too long for a second season. Most viewers already forgotten about it or didn't care. PLUS the lack of advertising. Old viewers didn't even know it was getting a second season. 
The Shannara Chronicles,after it lefted MTV it pretty much left my watchlist. is season 2 any good?
The Shannara Chronicles,"Watched like two episodes on netflix and I have to say, some of the most impressively rigid acting and poor costume/set design I've ever seen. Like, not even cheap looking, which I find excusable, just aesthetically horrible decisions that should have gotten the entire wardrobe and set design team blacklisted for life."
The Shannara Chronicles,"I thought S1 was fair / decent, but I would not say really good.  "
The Shannara Chronicles,"The Shanarra series was my favorite series in high school and I read 15-20 books in the series.

I tried two episodes of this show and wanted to cry because it was no where near the atmosphere of the books. Just cute people doing cute things on an adventure "
The Shannara Chronicles,The showrunners are better off focusing on Into the Badlands anyway 
The Shannara Chronicles,Did season 2 even air?
The Shannara Chronicles,"I think it'd be much more successful if it were called ""The Sha Na Na Chronicles"" and focused on rock music in the 50s."
The Shannara Chronicles,"Good. This was pure fuckery from the start. Too many tropes, terrible dialogue, not enough cohesive storytelling, and absolutely awful acting.

Manu Bennett was good in the _role_ of Allanon, but the writers saw fit to get his ass handed to him way too much to be the last Druid and a powerful magic user.

Austin Butler was okay and he looked like the  Wil Ohmsford I always imagined when I would read Elfstones.

Eretria was bisexual because reasons.

Garet Jax was a cocky mercenary for hire and not the highly skilled weapons master from Wishsong, whose only desire was to find a worthy opponent.

This is great news. Maybe wait a year or two and go for a reboot with a proper budget and more attention to the source material."
The Shannara Chronicles,"Saw it coming, still sad. :("
The Shannara Chronicles,"Its impressive and very well done, its just that its so goddamn boring and very, well niche audience. Plus lack of any advertisement or exposure, and i didnt even know anything about it until I started watching and I just couldnt get into it. "
The Shannara Chronicles,"Im not really its target market, but watched season 1 since it was on Netflix. It was OK in a young adult sort of way, but watched 10 mins of season 2 and just turned it off."
The Shannara Chronicles,Good riddance.  That show was so terrible.
The Shannara Chronicles,It was horrible. Lots of teenage sexual innuendo that had nothing to do with the books. Epic fantasy it was not.
The Shannara Chronicles,Blows my mind that the woman in the screencap is the girl from Pan's Labyrinth.
The Shannara Chronicles,I'll be the first to admit I clicked through episodes for the eyecandy. Plot (what little I could make of it) was a absolutr garbage.
The Shannara Chronicles,"I’m surprised it was only on its second season before it got cancelled I thought season one premiered years ago. I also thought it was cancelled after season one like most because I never heard anything about it. Hell, I’m not even sure what the show is about... "
The Shannara Chronicles,"weather one likes the series or not: seeing that it is an Amazon Prime exclusive in Germany and seeing that is has a lot of reviews (quite positive) on Prime in Germany which indicates that many people watch it, the show might find a new home after all for season 3. It's one of those shows of which I watch an episode once in a while, I think it is quite ok. I don't know the book, though."
The Shannara Chronicles,"I'm not even into fantasy but watched both seasons (no good excuse for this, too much time on my hands probably)

Show was ok second season was no better or worse for me than the first. I haven't read the books though.

The main hero annoyed me quite a bit some of that annoyance was probably due to the writing."
The Shannara Chronicles,"Damn, it sucks. I liked watching it. Hopefully someone else picks it up."
The Shannara Chronicles,"I liked this show it was thowaway fun, shame no one advertised the season 2"
The Shannara Chronicles,There was a season 2? I didn't watch season 1 but had no idea there was a season 2.
The Shannara Chronicles,"I never read the books and I only watched the first season because I was bored and it was on Netflix.  I was hooked, it felt like it was the period after the post apocalypse where there was society but still the scars of the old world.

  I haven't seen season 2 yet  and I am excited for it but I am gutted there isn't going to be season 3
"
The Shannara Chronicles,"One thing bothers me about Shannara books - why the fuck is everything ""... of Shannara""?? Shannara is not the name of that world/land. Shannara was some king in one of the books or something. Of no particular significance. "
The Shannara Chronicles,God the name of this show alone make is sounds like its awful cheap fantasy/SF. 
The Shannara Chronicles,"I enjoyed the show for what it was. It wasn't great but it filled a niche. I expected this though so, okay. "
The Shannara Chronicles,It was not engaging and mediocre. The script was just so bland. 
The Shannara Chronicles,I have never heard of this show before.
The Shannara Chronicles,"I read the first three books starting with wizards first rule and after doing some investigating  now I see what your saying. I enjoyed those first three books I do remember them being filled with sex and s&m themes. Which played right up my alley in my teenage years. Maybe wouldn’t hold up in a re-read as an adult, like the shannara series. Thanks for the insight."
The Shannara Chronicles,awwww thats shame i liked it never read the books though 
The Shannara Chronicles,"Did season 2 wrap up the show, or did it just die in the middle of a story arc?"
The Shannara Chronicles,"the series was entertaining when i read it as a kid. i went back and tried to read ""sword"" and ""elfstones"" and they were so bad as to be nearly unreadable. i read *about* the other shannara books and they were supposed to be even more poorly written.  i gave first episode or two a chance for nostagia's sake. wow. i was flabbergasted as how atrocious it was. how fake it looked. how completely they mangled the, admittedly insipid, plotline. most of all everything looked too *shiny* and ""MTV."". the characters all looked like members of real world or road rules with shitty ""old timey"" outfits. and sexy allanon. jesus. that was the worst."
The Shannara Chronicles,It never should have gotten a second season.  It was nothing like the books and it was cringy teen angst
The Shannara Chronicles,"They leaned too heavily on presenting it as CW style young adult fantasy.  The early Elfstone and Swords of Shannara novels were also the first books that Terry Books wrote, and probably his most amateur and derivative ones.  They would have been better off adapting his later novels, like the Word and the Void series."
The Shannara Chronicles,"Wow, so much suck in this statement. Show was great, Eretria is a babe, and spike is no longer? Damn."
The Shannara Chronicles,"I absolutely loved the books, but haven't seen the show."
The Shannara Chronicles,Probably because of how much it sucked.
The Shannara Chronicles,"Love the books, hated the show.  Made it all the way through season one.  Knew about season two but passed."
The Shannara Chronicles,"Shame, I loved this show. Too bad the lack of publicity caused it to be missed by the masses because I'm sure lot of people would like it. There's some pretty good CGI and fight scenes, especially in season2. And the female cast was hard to look away."
The Shannara Chronicles,"Good, it was absolute trash. How this kept going longer than Emerald City I really don't know."
The Shannara Chronicles,[deleted]
The Shannara Chronicles,what a shit name for a show
The Shannara Chronicles,"So sad that such a great set of books is presented like this. Same thing they did with the Terry Goodkind seeker series, make some terrible tv show and try to pass it off to fans hoping to hit pay dirt. "
The Shannara Chronicles,Yeah seriously failure. I didn't even know that it was on Spike and not on MTV.
The Shannara Chronicles,Season 2 came out? 
The Shannara Chronicles,"I was in the same boat. I didn't even know that season 1 existed until I randomly came across the BR on a discount during BF sales! How do you put that much money into vfx, get somewhat known actors, shill out the cash for the book rights, and then do no marketing at all? Baffling."
The Shannara Chronicles,and it was a weak plot...
The Shannara Chronicles,It's cause they moved it to Spike and then...didn't advertise it. At all it seems.
The Shannara Chronicles, I only know it because I follow Ivana Baquero on Instagram.
The Shannara Chronicles,"After the first season ended the only thing i said was, ""that's it?""  The ending was stupid.  There was no urgency to the whole matter.  The saving grace was that the girls were really pretty."
The Shannara Chronicles,"I'm surprised aswell.

I saw one episode and just noped out, it was so disgustingly bad."
The Shannara Chronicles,"I only knew about it because I've seen it on Amazon prime. I've watched a bunch of episodes of the first season (or the whole season? I don't remember) and it had potential, but the story and characters were so terribly clichéd and boring and the world building fell flat...the only good part about it was that Crixus was in it and he reminded me of the (in large part) equally dumb, but much much more fun Spartacus show. "
The Shannara Chronicles,I'm upset. The show was promising. I had hoped for a season two.. And this is the first I'm hearing of it. Fucking MTV. They keep the shitty reality type TV shows running but sell off their first promising fantasy show? Meh. 
The Shannara Chronicles,"Watched them all, always looked like a fantasy-parody porn.

I couldn't match anything to my memory of the books either, but I give them the benefit of the doubt on that as it's been decades."
The Shannara Chronicles,You did better than me. I couldn't finish the first episode.
The Shannara Chronicles,"I wish they would do WoT like they did Game of Thrones. Quick HBO, throw millions of dollars at a WoT series, GoT only has one more season!"
The Shannara Chronicles,"To be fair, Robert Jordan missed the point from book five on..."
The Shannara Chronicles,"So hard to get through WOT. I was so bored with all the word salad. Could care less about some six chapters devoted to picking out dresses in some city. The juicy parts were very anticlimactic. I gave up after book 5 even though I bought the whole series. I have no idea how they'd turn that into a series unless they dumped huge chunks of chapters.

Now Elfstones of Shannara was a great read for me in Jr High - and it also had a lot of extra unnecessary verbiage - but nothing like the WOT series."
The Shannara Chronicles,"I am probably never going to get around to reading the books but the Shannara Chronicles show was dope. I don't give a shit about how it differs from the source material. Plus, if I ever do read the series it would only be because the show made me aware of it."
The Shannara Chronicles,"Season 1 loosely follows book 2 from the first trilogy, season 2 they just totally made up themselves and pulled a few characters and locations from a wide assortment of books. 
You won't be able to finish the story from the TV show because it doesn't exist, if you chose to forget the TV show and go into the books fresh then you will be in for a pretty decent read. "
The Shannara Chronicles,"Yeah, it probably would have done better on The CW or Freeform."
The Shannara Chronicles,"Should have*

It is NEVER ""should of""."
The Shannara Chronicles,"The second season completely went away from the books.  Just saying that as a fact - not a good or bad.

I can't say which season was better.   Neither were great or awful.  It's not essential TV but if you liked the first season, you'll probably like the second."
The Shannara Chronicles,All I gotta say is...the girls are pretty.
The Shannara Chronicles,"The second season was better than the first.  Its still just marginally less campy than Legend of the Seeker, Xena, or Hercules.  It isn't particularly deep, but its somewhat fun fantasy.  

The biggest difference between season 1 and 2 is that Poppy Drayton (Amberle) has a far reduced role and they introduce Malese Jow's (who has been a side character on a bunch of different shows ranging from The Flash to Vampire Diaries to NCIS LA) character.  Jow is less pretty than Drayton but a much better actress.  

Worth watching on Netflix if you're bored and nothing else looks good. "
The Shannara Chronicles,There was a second season? Season 1 wasn’t that bad to watch.
The Shannara Chronicles,Much better than the first in my opinion. They upgraded the cgi and the action scenes.
The Shannara Chronicles,"A large chunk of the costume team were NZ industry veterans coming off of LOTR and Hobbit actually. I loved the costumes personally, just wish some of them looked more worn."
The Shannara Chronicles,I hated the way the dwarves (or where they gnomes?) and trolls looked. 
The Shannara Chronicles,"With an eventual spin-off following one of the original members into his career as the world's top forensic linguist!

""Glee meets Mindhunter"" is the elevator pitch"
The Shannara Chronicles,"> Manu Bennett was good in the role of Allanon

Too short.  He would have made a good Walker Boh though."
The Shannara Chronicles,"I wouldn't call Austin Butler's acting okay, and he looked more like a member of the band Hanson than any Elf Muggle"
The Shannara Chronicles,"> Eretria was bisexual because reasons

This is what kept me watching.  Allanon was pretty cool too though."
The Shannara Chronicles,"> This is great news. Maybe wait a year or two and go for a reboot with a proper budget and more attention to the source material.

This is incredibly unlikely.  Studios don't typically reboot massive failures. "
The Shannara Chronicles,Netflix has it in Europe but no offline download option :/
The Shannara Chronicles,Just read the books instead
The Shannara Chronicles,wrong series bro
The Shannara Chronicles,"Yeah, I hate how Wheel of Time ripped off all their ideals."
The Shannara Chronicles,"Season 2 wrapped up its own arc, however it definitely set up the story for the next season. It wasn't a classic cliff hanger exactly, but it definitely didn't tie everything up nicely. 

Honestly I think the show was a massive misstep. With the success of GoT they tried to do their own fantasy series but missed the mark. If it had of aimed a lot closer to LotR in tone it could of been much better. It was more like the quality of one of the worse CW superhero show episodes. "
The Shannara Chronicles,I've read almost the whole Shannara library and very much enjoyed them. The show was nothing like the books. 100% did not enjoy.
The Shannara Chronicles,"[My Sister](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=siJZXTuwBjA)

"
The Shannara Chronicles,"Except Sword of Truth is a terrible series to begin with, as well as Goodkind being a terrible person."
The Shannara Chronicles,The Seeker tv series was way better than the books. It gave off the classic Hercules/Xena vibe while not having the preachy Randian bullshit and rape porn that crapped up the books.
The Shannara Chronicles,"> great set of books

But they wouldn't be able to do different books. I think they even said that. Because, with a few exceptions, every book is about different set of characters separated by hundreds of years sometimes. So they would have to replace the whole cast every season."
The Shannara Chronicles,"Yep, am currently watching it.  It's horrible but the girls are pretty as fuck.  The cancellation was not a thing they could prevent."
The Shannara Chronicles,"No kidding, I just seen that there is a season 2 already out that I haven’t heard anything about. "
The Shannara Chronicles,I'm not even sure I could have confidently told you Spike was still around.
The Shannara Chronicles,"Amazon prime in Europe hyped it pretty hard, I saw lots of trailers for season 2. It's also marketed as a Amazon production (or at least exclusive) over here."
The Shannara Chronicles,"I had an advertisement for this when I saw Blade Runner in the theater, only time I've seen or heard anyone mention it ever "
The Shannara Chronicles,Teen wolf was a far better fantasy show than TSC imo.  At least acting wise.  They needed more shirtless hunky guys on TSC too.
The Shannara Chronicles,">always looked like a fantasy-parody porn.

Yeah they were clearly trying to go for a Game of Thrones/hunger games -esque show but for like tweens or something."
Eastsiders,Sorry this is entirely unrelated but I read that as *Eastenders* and became severely worried about you.
Eastsiders,Same!
Eastsiders,Pretty cool. I like when SNL encourages performers to go weird. Reminds me of Robyn's crazy dance moves when she was on: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SlB1f6Vc2uY
Eastsiders,"I thought this was amazing! Lip syncing or not, to be able to do that in real time while even making it look like you were singing blew my mind!

She’s a mega-talent!"
Eastsiders,"Cool idea for a performance, but the lip-syncing is so obvious."
Eastsiders,I also thought it was impressive that she participated / starred in most of the sketches. I didn’t realize that she could do humor  as well as singing and drawing.
Eastsiders,Downvoted because geoblocked and no mirror.
Eastsiders,She sang over a backing track.  You can hear her mic pack hit the ground when she sits down at the end.
Eastsiders,Is it? At 2:44 she's audibly catching her breath and smiling given how much she hasn't gotten done.
Eastsiders,"i mean, i dunno if she's lipsyncing or just heavily autotuned... in any case, halsey is amazing."
Eastsiders,"Yes, she's obviously lip syncing which is sad to see. Oh well. At least they started playing the right mp3 file, unlike when Ashley Simpson's SNL lip syncing went wrong all those years ago...

https://youtu.be/-kpxA-TOLmA"
Eastsiders,"She can't draw. There's a light pencil outline on it of what she's suppose to ""make"" and all she's doing is essentially tracing with paint."
Eastsiders,"Is it my job to provide that for you?
ut let me ask, does this work? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySmBqIKZi3E"
Eastsiders,"Her mic was live, the singing wasn't. It's how most network live performances are done these days. That way you gets breaths and what not in the mic to make it seem like it is live."
Eastsiders,"Her mouth is clearly just a tad behind the recording in the beginning. Just watch her lips and listen to the song, ignore everything else. Definitely lip syncing. Her mic may have been live, but she is not singing. This is how almost all live performances are done on TV now, it is rare for networks to allow artists to truly perform live."
Eastsiders,"Ooh interesting, thanks for clarifying! That’s a pretty cool piece of set design then; at home, I wasn’t able to see anything on the floor before she started “drawing”."
Eastsiders,"Your evidence doesn't support your conclusion. Having a outline ready to go doesn't take away from the audacity to try this live, and she's posted other art of hers."
Eastsiders,"I just watched it again and I still disagree. It looked and sounded, to me, like she was singing over a track, which makes sense because it's difficult to sing when you're crouched on your knees and hunched over."
Eastsiders,"Got a timestamp?

Like look at 3:11 as well - you can hear a backing track when she doesn't sing ""eastside"" but its lower in volume than her actual voice."
Eastsiders,"I thought it was great, really looking forward to seeing more. 

Also want to find out what the hell is going on with that little girl. Is she real or imaginary, is she Emma or Lyn when they were younger?"
Eastsiders,I'm so glad for this show :) as a lesbian Mexican-American I finally got something that's not Nacho Libre!
Eastsiders,is there a vida subreddit?
Eastsiders,"Ladies and gentlemen. We have something on our hands.

What a class of a premier. From the TOPP notch acting, to the plot twists to the setup for so many choices in the future of how this show could go. 

Pick your character, pick your theory, doesn't matter just jump on board. 

I thought it was dope. I hear people throw this saying around a lot but in this case it is authentic...there is nothing on T.V even close to like this."
Eastsiders,"Ok, Marisol, is my fav so far. I loved the whole interaction with the sisters and Marisol. I love it because I can easily undestadn and relate. I do use the word watchala and parkiar (however you spell it) This hos is important. I need it renewed. I need to rewatch it, I saw it before i Had to go to school. It was great. I can say right away I don't care about Johnny. 

I also want to add how it became close to home when the played one of Selena's song in the end credits. Like the representation. "
Eastsiders,"This show feels so inauthentic. Do people really talk like that? Dropping in random words in Spanish that hold no significance?  Johnny is the only, non-sister, that sounds legit because he only uses Spanish for nouns and verbs for specific words- not random bullshit.
No using ""pero"" one second then ""but"" the next.  "
Eastsiders,incredibly good 
Eastsiders,I like how the sisters aren't necessarily likable but they're both interesting. Excited to keep on watching and see where it goes next.
Eastsiders,I wanna know too. 
Eastsiders,The show plays with magical realism so it could be related to that
Eastsiders,[deleted]
Eastsiders,The series premiere mention a lot of secrets or info the viewers has yet to find out and I'm here to know more about it. 
Eastsiders,"Have you spent any time in neighborhoods with majority Latinx populations? A lot of people speak like this, especially with that particular mixture of English peppered in with Spanish words. My sister-in-law in particular speaks exactly in the way you’re describing, changing out words between Spanish and English from one sentence to the next. "
Eastsiders,"Are you guys kidding or do you actually mean this stuff? 

Honest question. "
A Very Secret Service,Looks like no one got the joke!
A Very Secret Service,"The humor in this show is great, so goddamn dry it could almost be British. I'm not sure how enjoyable it is if you don't have some knowledge of French history in the 20th century (like the CIA speaking positively about Petain in that scene) but I loved it."
A Very Secret Service,Y a pot ?
A Very Secret Service,"I've yet to watch it, but I'm pretty sure it was made by Arte originally, not Netflix. I do need to watch tho."
A Very Secret Service,"Love this show. Honestly Netflix is always trying to put their tag on anything, even if all they did was bring it to US audience.  Their tag is so broad now it has really reduced my expectations of any ""Netflix"" show. "
A Very Secret Service,"It's a fantastic, funny show. Don't miss it!"
A Very Secret Service,"Ah interesting, the whole 'Netflix Original' thing always perplexed me"
A Very Secret Service,I'm glad there's another fan! Yeah I never know with the Netflix tag anymore too - but I tend to err on the side of trusting them (emotionally).
A Very Secret Service,Hehe only took over 5 years for someone to notice 🥲
A Very Secret Service,"Netflix Original is ""you can't watch it anywhere else in your country legally""."
A Very Secret Service,So what is 'made by Netflix' then?
A Very Secret Service,"The marvel shows to name a few, many shows on Netflix that are originals are just bought by them so they can stream, they didn't really create them "
A Very Secret Service,So we can't tell if it's bought by or made by Netflix just through the *Netflix Original* tag
A Very Secret Service,"If you research them, maybe "
A Very Secret Service,"Even the linked trailer, which has English subtitles, was posted by [Netflix en Español](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzfhV0n4FWBgDoSwMPr6wWQ)"
A Very Secret Service,"I've been watching this, and really enjoying it. I think a few jokes are culturally over my head - all the seemingly racist stuff about the African colonies - but most of it is quite good. Also.... Mathilde Warnier, the love interest he meets in episode two.... Man, too much for me. Probably my main reason for watching really...."
A Very Secret Service,"I think even if a joke is over your head, such as ones dealing with the relationship between France and African countries or France and Algeria (Algeria is France!) in the 1960s, they're still funny just contextually. I think by far my favorite joke is the conversation between the French agents and the two CIA agents (not sure of the episode). I think it's a great show and was surprised when I found no links in /r/television for it. "
A Very Secret Service, The CIA agents making mistakes in their French and getting corrected was hilarious. Because of course.
A Very Secret Service,"The original Chilean ""documentary"" was nominated for an Oscar and it's absolutely brilliant."
A Very Secret Service,"Alright! I have to admit this sounds a pretty interesting premise, and with Schur and Danson I have a feeling it will be a hit."
A Very Secret Service,Add Jason Schwartzman and Zach Galifianakis and just make this a continuation of Bored to Death.
A Very Secret Service,Ted Danson and Michael Shur just feel like it has to be on NBC
A Very Secret Service,Not bad for an intern.
A Very Secret Service,I’ll watch anything Schur makes. He’s banked so much goodwill that I’m excited for this despite it being a Netflix property
A Very Secret Service,is the main character gonna be called sam moleswell?
A Very Secret Service,Schur and Danson? Sign me up please.
A Very Secret Service,"...okay, I'm interested"
A Very Secret Service,Just wish it wasn’t Netflix. I like my sitcoms to have more than 8 episodes a season.
A Very Secret Service,I am 100% onboard with that
A Very Secret Service,"Oh man, I need to watch the original, they say it's beautiful."
A Very Secret Service,Who taught Mose sex?
A Very Secret Service,"Had to read the article, but Mike Schur is actually writing this.  They aren't just putting his name on it for extra traction.  Im down.  That guy has written some of my favorite shows."
A Very Secret Service,Netflix will cancel it after one season so that's a big pass from me.
A Very Secret Service,"I looked up the documentary and it says it's 'docufiction', what does that mean?"
A Very Secret Service,What is known for sure - jazz is going to be insulted in some way.
A Very Secret Service,Isn't it actually a documentary?
A Very Secret Service,Michael's new twist on his human life.
A Very Secret Service,Well this is a Universal Television production. It's likely that either NBC and Peacock passed on it or Netflix just offered more money.
A Very Secret Service,"really cool to see how he’s grown in his time at meadowlark, i think he has potential"
A Very Secret Service,I’m assuming the main character lives in Sacramento and is investigating why the Miami Heat suck so much as an organization and are ruining the NBA.
A Very Secret Service,"Agreed. While Rutherford Falls didn't hit for me, it was still pretty decent. And if THAT is his stumble? Then bring it on.

P&R and Good Place are incredible."
A Very Secret Service,Sam Moleone ^^^^(Malone)
A Very Secret Service,Lance Manion
A Very Secret Service,Epic joke Elon!
A Very Secret Service,"It really reads plot-wise more as a movie or mini-series to me anyway.

So because of that, it's a big pass from me also."
A Very Secret Service,"I watched the original. The main character is hired to live in a retirement home for a few weeks to check up on a particular resident. I didn't read anything about it, but I remember he actually had a cameraman and sound technician following him around recording him a lot of the time. 

So the residents and staff would have known what was going on, and I guess would have been instructed to just act as natural as possible."
A Very Secret Service,"It's as staged as a film can be and still qualify as a documentary. I don't have a problem with it being labeled a documentary, but I wouldn't want to suggest it to people without qualifying that it's not what a lot of people think of when they hear the term."
A Very Secret Service,"Yea, Schur is signed with NBCUniversal, all of his projects are gonna be Universal Television projects."
A Very Secret Service,"Great show, very clever and good acting.  I like how the show lets the viewer share the “super power” of the main character."
A Very Secret Service,"I want to watch, but not enough to add another streaming service"
A Very Secret Service,"If this was on Netflix it'd be streaming #1 right now. This show was a pleasant surprise. It took me 2 episodes to realize it's not a murder mystery, the mystery lies in how she catches them. It's a fresh take in the genre for sure.

EDIT: Yes....I know it is very similar to Columbo. I knew that before I wrote the comment. When I say ""fresh"", I mean relative to the other ""murder mystery"" options out there today."
A Very Secret Service,"Yeah I am enjoying the show. I'm a big fan of Columbo so I'm excited to see that kind of narrative style brought back, titles are also really retro. Very clever and fun framework for having cool guest stars every episode, looking forward to the weekly installments."
A Very Secret Service,"Been on a bit of a Russian Doll binge recently, late to the party I know but it’s created a new appreciation for Natasha Leonne, she’s bloody brilliant. Look forward to watching this."
A Very Secret Service,"Love the show, in my eyes Natasha Lyonne is the Tom Cruise of television, she plays herself in everything, I don’t mean that in a bad way, I find her totally intriguing and entertaining. I hope I never tire of her.

Soundtrack is good too, the gentle understated banjo just seems to fit nicely."
A Very Secret Service,"His comparison of shows like this one and ""Columbo"" to sitcoms was spot on. The mystery hooks us, but we keep coming back to spend more time with the characters. Every episode I watch the opening murder scenes with interest, but I'm really just anxious for my buddy Charlie Cale to show up and solve the crime while charming the pants off everyone she meets."
A Very Secret Service,It’s a great show.  The entire family loves it.  It’s like a throwback but with a prestige format.
A Very Secret Service,I’m happy for Peacock that they have original programming to go with The Office and Yellowstone. I’m in the minority but I think Comcast/NBC/Peacock and Paramount/CBS will still be around in 20 years. I’ve read three blind mice and they are no strangers to evolving landscapes as they have survived cable and HBO/Showtime.
A Very Secret Service,"Peacock is on a roll. First Paul T Goldman, now this."
A Very Secret Service,"I like the show, but her ""power"" makes it a bit easy for her to find the murderer each time. 

1. Wait for a murder
2. Talk to some people about the murder
3. When you hear they are lying, ask more questions until you guess how they do it.

They've not had many instances where she finds a liar who **isn't** the murderer."
A Very Secret Service,I love it. But I literally love everything Rian Johnson does. But watching Poker Face (which i love) I couldnt help but think that its extremely well crafted. It's very meticulous and even though the bad people get caught what they do is extremely smart and clever. I wonder if Rian Johnson is trying to do a perfect murder in real life.
A Very Secret Service,I see people talking about it constantly. Probably Peacock’s biggest original series.
A Very Secret Service,"I liked the show so far, but my only issue is with how unbelievably coincidental all the events have been relative to the star's timing (when the star showed up in the lives of each episode's guests)."
A Very Secret Service,"100%, I just watched the 4 episodes yesterday and yea every episode was pretty great."
A Very Secret Service,The first episode was okay. It's there to set up the series. I liked the 2nd and 3rd episodes much better. They're great.
A Very Secret Service,"I think the show is good, but the fact that the main character has basically superpowers (she just knows when someone is lying) feels very gimmicky and cheap."
A Very Secret Service,"I've enjoyed it so far. The metal band episode was good but the music they played... I'm not a metal gatekeeper or anything but I don't understand how there was nobody at all anywhere near the set who found it in them to explain that what they were singing wasn't metal by any stretch of the term.

Not a dealbreaker because the story itself was cute the same way of Poker Face has been so far (that is, cute in a macabre sort of way) but it's one of those things."
A Very Secret Service,Gonna start it once I catch up with Mayor of Kingstown s2
A Very Secret Service,"For anyone who has Xfinity in the US: Check your bill, I have been getting Peacock for free on my plan for a while and literally only just noticed the other day."
A Very Secret Service,I’m officially in love with Natasha Lyonne now!
A Very Secret Service,"The show started to fall off after episode 3 for me. Really wanted to like it, but the writing was starting to go down."
A Very Secret Service,"WARNING SPOILER BELOW

Pretty sure Charlie is actual Death or
Something similar that will be revealed at the end of the season.  Despite avenging all these peoples deaths, her direct interaction and recommendation is what causes them to be killed in the first place.  Her friend in the first episode with the child pornography, black web stuff,  the guy going vegan in the third episode because she want him those movies to watch etc. etc.   

Really good show"
A Very Secret Service,Is it just an old-school mystery show or are their any Johnson ‘gimmicks’ or subversions? I love the Knives Out for his twists.
A Very Secret Service,"I'm enjoying it, though I'm only 2 episodes in. It really is a hybrid of Columbo and The Rockford Files. 

I got a paid Peacock sub just to watch this show and it's astonishing that Peacock still has such a pathetic library relative to its competitors. I will say it was neat to be able to watch 24 Hours of Daytona, and if I were a bigger wrestling fan this would be neat but aside from Poker Face it looks like they're still the ""What, you don't like The Office anymore?"" streamer. 

If this were on literally any other service barring maybe Starz it would indeed be bigger."
A Very Secret Service,"Doesn't even have a UK release yet, I'm not sure about other international territories. Why delay a streaming only show? Who benefits?"
A Very Secret Service,"Great show, I am obsessed with Natasha’s gravelly voice. Can’t wait for the next episode to be released."
A Very Secret Service,"It reminds me of a blue skies era USA show. I miss those, so I'm loving it so far. I also find it amusing how she's trying to get out of there before the cops show up but also set it up so there is available evidence and so on for the person to not get out of trouble.

My only wish is that, like all of these shows, that they would take on other types of crime than murder. If I were her and people were dropping like flies everywhere I went, I'd start to think I was a death omen of some sort. Taking down the gambler running his own games was a fun plot in the pilot but that got put aside for the central murder mystery.

Also, the _Sucker Punch_ song has been stuck in my head for days since watching episode 4."
A Very Secret Service,"I’m only on the 2nd episode and I really love how effortlessly diverse the cast is. Anyway really enjoying it so far…I’m only watching on Peacock because a family member with Xfinity let’s me use their login, I’m the only one that uses it."
A Very Secret Service,I'm loving this modern female fucked up version of Columbo.
A Very Secret Service,"I hate Peacock, they need to die snd just put thier shit on Paramount."
A Very Secret Service,"hard agree

if it was on Netflix or HBO, this sub would be melting over it.

it's also unlucky that TLOU is also on at the same time."
A Very Secret Service,"Don't get me wrong, I really liked it, but it started getting repetitive after the 3rd episode."
A Very Secret Service,Enjoying the show but find it a bit too convenient that a human lie detector just happens to have random acquaintances murdered on a weekly basis. Some suspension of disbelief required.
A Very Secret Service,I’m paying 99 cents a month for a year’s subscription to Peacock. I had no idea Poker Face would be on it and am so glad I got this great deal. I love this show.
A Very Secret Service,"Oh! Thanks for the reminder that it dropped! Love Natasha and honestly, I enjoy Peacock. I'm a Bravo watcher (love Below Deck) and love that I can watch on there and not worry about recording.  The Peacock Exclusive Below Deck Down Under was so good, they put it on the network later.  

You all should be binge watching The Traitor as well!  Delicious show!  Interesting mix of people... some ""contest reality"" with Survivor,  Big Brother, etc alums;  then Bravolebrities (Below Deck, Housewives, Shahs); an Olympic athlete (they almost have be liking Ryan Lochte), and then average never been on TV people!

Plus Alan Cumming.  It is why I couldn't resist."
A Very Secret Service,"I've been meaning to watch this, been too busy but I should be getting to it soon.  Thanks for reminding me."
A Very Secret Service,"I don't think I'll be watching the rest.

It's procedural and very predictable already. I don’t mind procedurals but it feels a bit copy and paste.

Story happens, someone or a group of peuple kill a person.

Then we find out she has some kind of link to that person and finds something quickly that makes her think it's fishy. Her ""magic"" lie detector superpower already feels like a crutch."
A Very Secret Service,Trailer had me thinking that it would be a different type of show
A Very Secret Service,"So the first episode has the human lie detector watching hidden cameras of the players faces to then tell the player who is bluffing.      

Over just watching the cameras of the cards they are holding?"
A Very Secret Service,It's just a murder she wrote rip-off for genz
A Very Secret Service,Should've been on Netflix like Russian Doll. 😡
A Very Secret Service,Is peacock going to get absorbed by Hulu or something anytime soon?
A Very Secret Service,Why is anything that Rian Johnson involved in relentlessly promoted on reddit? It's annoying.
A Very Secret Service,Can’t stand Natasha Lyonne
A Very Secret Service,Liked first two episodes then they started with the politics and ruined it.
A Very Secret Service,I’ll never watch this. If he ruined Star Wars then I’ll do my best to ruin his show and future movies
A Very Secret Service,"i just like to know if my prediction so far is true. 

how many white bad men have been the murderer?

and if was not a bad white man, but someone else, then i expect at least that a white man was the problem, like he raped someone or exploited people for monetary gains, therefor the killing was justified in the viewers mind.

so how far did i do i have not watched any episode yet."
A Very Secret Service,It's so good!
A Very Secret Service,Rest in Metal
A Very Secret Service,I haven’t gotten a chance to watch this yet. Been catching up on other stuff. I am hoping to get to it this week at some point. If I time it right there will be a 5th episode to enjoy once I start it.
A Very Secret Service,"I’ll watch anything Natasha Lyonne is in, she’s such a creative force (don’t know how she didn’t get a Emmy writing nod for s2 of Russian Doll)."

>“As far as the longevity of the show, to me, it just feels infinite. That’s kind of the easy part. And I think that might be the cause of some frustration on the fans’ part, because my original commitment to just, I think a good TV show is one that lasts 1000 episodes. You don’t design a paper airplane to land at a certain spot a certain distance for you. A good paper airplane is the one that stays in the air forever, and that’s impossible but you fold it in a way that that’s the goal.”

>“That’s the nice thing about ‘Rick and Morty’ is I feel like from Episode 1 forward, there’s always been a commitment in the DNA of the show to not engage in so much soap opera-ness that there’s an inevitable conclusion coming – you know, Mulder is gonna find his sister and he won’t have a reason to do ‘X-Files’ anymore (laughs). We don’t really have that. We’ve certainly got elements that can only happen once as far as revelations about Rick and stuff like that, but I do believe that the adventures can go on for theoretically 1000 episodes.”


>“This is the strangest thing I’ve ever said about the show and it still feels unreal to say it, but we’ll be doing a season a year now. I still don’t understand how that’s possible. But that’s why it never happened on my watch. [Showrunner] Scott [Marder] is able to keep us on a schedule that mostly involves being so ahead of schedule that we can actually release things in a timely manner.”"
Justin Time GO!,Solar Opposites consistent release schedule has proved that Harmon is the issue in Rick and Mortys production.
Justin Time GO!,Is that a threat?
Justin Time GO!,"As long as the show remain creative, entertaining and fun I will keep watching until the final episode."
Justin Time GO!,"Look, just take your time, I dont mind waiting"
Justin Time GO!,Getting on a yearly schedule? That shit is cash
Justin Time GO!,"It's kind of weird, I was drawn to Rick and morty because it had a deeper continuity than other animated comedies and the ongoing story arcs got pretty serious. It felt like it was all leading somewhere.

When it just became every other animated comedy is when I dropped it. So hearing one season a year forever doesn't fill me with joy."
Justin Time GO!,"""And you'll fuckin watch it"""
Justin Time GO!,Probably should've been able to do that when it was the zeitgeist back in like 2015.
Justin Time GO!,R&M will continue to be a super popular and profitable show but creatively it feels like they ran out of steam. None of the recent episodes made me feel empathy for the main characters. It feels more like a wacky idea presented each week with the characters moulded around it. This would be fine if the wacky ideas were interesting but most are just a twist on an idea they have already covered.
Justin Time GO!,It’s a fun show to watch. I don’t think they meant to have have an actual narrative with evil morty.
Justin Time GO!,There are some season 5 online haters out there. But my real-world friends and myself agree: We will watch this show for as long as it's on the air.
Justin Time GO!,This aged poorly
Justin Time GO!,"There’s no way this will turn out well. Keeping a show alive “forever” is keeping it alive until no one is interested anymore. Why do that to your show, besides greed?"
Justin Time GO!,Quantity does not equal quality.
Justin Time GO!,"Hopefully not with the same quality of last season… sorry, I love this show but I would probably skip over half the season on a rewatch."
Justin Time GO!,"Rick and morty forever. Rick Rick and morty 76 seasons. Morty and Rick. Just. Just Rick and mortying it up. Syndication. Rick and morty every season, three seasons a year"
Justin Time GO!,"If they can’t find the spark that made season one special then this show is doomed to the scrap heap. The last two seasons were completely derivative and that’s not a good look going into S6

South Park didn’t get derivative until at least S12"
Justin Time GO!,"""I'm sorry, Morty, it's a bummer... in reality you're as dumb as they come...

..and I needed those seeds REAL bad and I had to give them up; just to get your PARENTS off my back. So now we're gonna have to go get more.

And then we're gonna go on even MORE adventures after that, Morty. And you're gonna keep your MOUTH SHUT about it, Morty...

..because the world is full of idiots that don't understand what's important. And they'll TEAR us apart, Morty!!

But if you stick with me, I'm gonna accomplish great things, Morty, and you're gonna be part of 'em.

And together we're gonna run around, Morty, we're gonna... do all kinds of wonderful things, Morty. Just you and me, Morty.

Justin Time GO!,Lost me with the terrible writing last season.
Justin Time GO!,"And this. Right here. Is why you shouldn’t be expecting maintained quality. 

I’ve never been as annoyed at the lack of continuity solely because I fully anticipated like 20 seasons of Rick and Morty by the success of season 3. Rick and Morty are Adult Swim’s SpongeBob, they’re gonna milk it for everything they’ve got."
Justin Time GO!,make more Harmen Quest!
Justin Time GO!,"I would love it to go forever but not sure season a year is a good idea. I would rather have less of the better R&M than more of the shittier one, if you catch my drift."
Justin Time GO!,"I’m… really not for this. R&M felt really special in the first 3 seasons and the character arcs felt well done. By the time the show gets to season 20 like Roiland is talking about, it’ll probably just be modern Simpson’s or Family Guy level writing. Maybe a bit wittier. But potentially not, honestly. 

Sometimes things need to end"
Justin Time GO!,"You and every other successful adult animated series.   Think about it: The Simpsons, Family Guy, Beavis and Butthead, South Park, Futurama, Bob's Burgers.  When you're an adult animated series on this level of popularity, which I would argue that Rick and Morty is indeed too, then you'll never really die. Sure your series might have a ""finale"" (cough Family Guy) or two (cough Beavis and Butthead) or three (cough Futurama), but your influence will live on so strong that inevitably somehow, you'll be back."
Justin Time GO!,Going the Family Guy/Simpsons route i see.   Steady decline as the years go on.

and of the solar opposites i really only like the wall episodes now...."
Justin Time GO!,If they are like season 4 or 5 then no thanks
Justin Time GO!,You two could be given a billion dollars and you still wouldn't be able to put out ten episodes in one year.
Justin Time GO!,And it'll continue to be not that great.
Justin Time GO!,Lmfao. Says the creators who took a WHOLE 3 YEARS to release a mediocre season
Justin Time GO!,Season 5 was boring af
Justin Time GO!,I thought the latter half of season five was fantastic. they had so many good lines. But season a year my ass Harmon lmao
Justin Time GO!,"I remember when ""a season a year"" was the goddamned norm.  And a ""season"" consisted of 22-27 episodes."
Justin Time GO!,"He says the same thing at one of the harmonquest conferences, basically that he has the creative holy grail of nonsense continuity with this show and he’ll never willingly give it up. From what he says Rick and Morty will stop when everyone begs it to stop"
Justin Time GO!,Bet
Justin Time GO!,"Pretty sure on harmontown he said that after the 70(?) episode renewal, he’s gonna take an early retirement"
Justin Time GO!,[RICK AND MORTY FOREVER AND FOREVER 100 YEARS](https://youtu.be/9Gtc4DHYvc0)
Justin Time GO!,Sure I’ll be downvoted but I would rather a Lemongrab series.
Justin Time GO!,"Don't say ""forever.""


Eventually, there will come a point where making the show just isn't as fun or creatively satisfying as it used to be. And while you may not realize it at the time you're making it, the show will likely reflect the fact that you're just not having fun anymore. 


There is no shame in walking away and taking pride in what you were able to produce."
Justin Time GO!,100 years!
Justin Time GO!,Rick and Morty forever for a thousand years Rick and morty rick and morty classic adventures
Justin Time GO!,i  hope it doesnt end up like the simpsons
Justin Time GO!,they took a lesson from the simpsons apparently
Justin Time GO!,Rick and Morty Forever!!!
Justin Time GO!,"there used to be really long gaps between seasons, looking forward to rick and morty becoming the new simpsons"
Justin Time GO!,"It will be interesting to see how the show evolves. I really enjoyed the first two seasons, but the show seemed to slide into something that felt empty in comparison to the early seasons. The newer stuff isn’t bad, it just lacks the crazy amount of oomph."
Justin Time GO!,All this from a low brow Back to the Future flash parody.
Justin Time GO!,"“Rick and morty forever, 100 years Rick and morty”"
Justin Time GO!,"Rick and morty forever, morty. Nine more *buuuuurp* seasons. Rick and *buuuuuuuurp* Rick and morty to infinitely and beyond!"
Justin Time GO!,"Sheesh, I didn't know so many people hated/disapproved of R&M until this thread 😂 here I am just mindlessly consuming and enjoying every episode."
Justin Time GO!,Simpsons did it
Justin Time GO!,"Ugh, does this mean we’ll have Rick and Morty fans for forever. If I never here pickle Rick or anything about schezwan sauce I’d be grateful."
Justin Time GO!,"""They just, <uurrrp> showed up with a dump truck full of money, Morty ""
""Uuhhh Rick, I don't know if the fans will like that""
""Shut up Morty, they're going to loooove it. I'm going to romance them with <urrp> a new season every year! We're going to be rich Morty, rich!""

Or something like that.... sound about right?"
Justin Time GO!,Should have done that years ago. Some of the hype definitely passed when they were taking years to release new seasons
Justin Time GO!,"Became unwatchable a couple of sessions back. Every episode felt like it was explaining to you why it was funny and clever instead of just telling interesting, funny what if sci fi stories with a dark comedy edgy."
Justin Time GO!,"Also lol of course it's infinite. He set his world up in an infinite space where nothing needs to have consequences and nothing needs to make sense.
That isn't actually a good thing if they're also unwilling to explore their characters deeper than they already had and don't care about throwaway characters people want to see again."

Justin Time GO!,Oh god they’re going to Simpsons it and it was already so out of steam
Justin Time GO!,the fandom killed my enjoyment and interest in this show im a couple of seasons behind I will watch it eventually
Justin Time GO!,Sure they are.
Justin Time GO!,"So now it's just up to post-hipster hipsters to proclaim that as of Season x, R&M has jumped the shark."
Justin Time GO!,"Ah yes, we Family Guy now. I’ve been waiting for it to get to this point."
Justin Time GO!,The moment has passed. Perhaps they shouldn't have wasted the amazing amount of momentum they had from the first two seasons.
Justin Time GO!,I said it after the first season. This will be the next simpsons
Justin Time GO!,The latest seasons were so bad...
Justin Time GO!,"Season 1 & 2 were good, but season 3 and beyond have sucked."
Justin Time GO!,"Honestly I'm over Rick and Morty, so many spin-offs it feels like every animated show has some sort of nod to their style.

It's fun I'll put it on when I'm bored but I'm sorry guys it's not all that."
Justin Time GO!,It's kinda too meta for me now
Justin Time GO!,Plz no

Justin Time GO!,Wubba lubba dub dub!
Justin Time GO!,"Yeah no one cares, this show stopped being funny in season 3. They started taking themselves way too seriously."
Justin Time GO!,As long as those seasons aren’t as poor as the last one.
Justin Time GO!,"Considering how much Adult Swim wants to make it their Simpsons and how mixed season 4 and 5 were, im glad I moved onto other series. The show already feels past it’s prime with how they took things starting in season 3, and would rather Adult Swim give more focus to stuff like Primal and Smiling Friends, even if they’re not as big as R&M"
Justin Time GO!,Rick and morty lost its touch after the third season now its just another adult animated show.
Justin Time GO!,"I guess I'm not getting it. I watched the first episode of this show, and it basically picks up in the middle of the action with no explanation or establishment of the characters and by the end I was like okay that was fun and wacky and there were some funny jokes, but why the F should I care about any of the characters in this show? I'm still trying to put my finger on it, but I basically walked away never caring if I saw another episode of the show."
Justin Time GO!,Hubris!
Justin Time GO!,Sorry South Park beat you to it.
Justin Time GO!,"RICK & MORTY FOREVER, 100 YEARS!!!!"
Off Camera,Sounds like the next season of “The Morning Show” has new material to pull from!
Off Camera,See? I told them they should have had the affair on camera!
Off Camera,Yeah proud cheaters probably are not good for ratings when your main audience are family’s getting ready for the day.
Off Camera,"I'll never understand why anyone would so jeopardize their hard-won, odds-against-success careers like this. I know, I know, the heart wants what the heart wants, but there were so many ways these two could have handled this, and they chose the worst option, a lose-lose for everyone including themselves, their families, their show."
Off Camera,So two rich attractive people have to find another job.
Off Camera,[removed]
Off Camera,y tho?
Off Camera,Oh no whatever will we do
Off Camera,I'm remarkably unmoved by this story.
Off Camera,The best decision. Professionalism is dying.
Off Camera,Who?
Off Camera,"I don't get why this is affecting their jobs. I am not saying cheating is okay but that is a private matter and it only concerns their families. What does this have to do with their jobs. I just hate how fucking puritanical America can get.

They can't be the first tv hosts who were doing the dirty while co-hosting a show. 

MSNBC's George Scarborough and Mika B cheated on their spouses and then divorced them and they didn't get fired. I only know about this because the Vulgarian who somehow became POTUS ranted about them in 2016."
Off Camera,Yawn. This is just try guys V2 or maybe Adam Levine v2
Off Camera,Hopefully they make an OF. He’s a freaky one
Off Camera,I’ll host GMA3
Off Camera,"The scathing take on these sorts of shows from ""Don't Look Up"" is reference-grade. I'm sort of surprised that name stars actually participated. Perhaps there is hope after all."
Off Camera,"They weren't particularly knowledgeable, they were just there to look good and read the teleprompter.   Those folks are easy to replace."
Off Camera,"The real brains in the room made the call bc although they’re cheating romance was unsavory, this was one of many for TJ and beyond the cringey tension it would create on-air, they are dodging the bullet of the inevitable meltdown or the next cheating episode that makes everyone look stupid for keeping them on. Cheaters are gonna cheat end of story"
Off Camera,"They broke up with their spouses months before this. Then they started openly hanging out in bars and restaurants in Manhattan. They aren't idiots, they knew they'd be outed. They wanted it.

Most Americans had no idea who they are, now all of Americs knows them. They are already rich, and now they are out of their contracts.  This widespread notoriety will make them far richer in the long run. Soon there will be the TJ & Amy show, and they will be the Executive Producers."
Off Camera,They're both horrible on TV though. Who cares if they're fucking?
Off Camera,I miss her legs
Off Camera,Doesn’t count if it’s on camera everybody knows that
Off Camera,What about when your main audience are cheaters getting ready for cheating?
Off Camera,"That might not be true. They could have waited to see the impact on ratings after a few months before deciding if they should be replaced. I don't watch GMA but I heard Robach was very popular. 

I don't know people say they were ""proud"" cheaters or that they were acting smug when they returned to the show after the scandal was revealed. They couldn't exactly cry and get angry on the show. They were filmed without their knowledge. Yes it was stupid to be out in public together but they might have already privately separated from their spouse or at least talked to them about ending the marriage but stayed living together for the sake of the children."
Off Camera,"I really can’t take ABC serious as a family channel given their channel (compared to Fox, NBC, CBS) has the most raunchiest and mature rated shows"
Off Camera,100%
Off Camera,"Because it became a public scandal, it was awkward for audiences watching the show after it came out, and ultimately they got replaced and the show didn't miss a beat because Robach and Holmes aren't stars. 

So it was just easier to throw the problem away and run their show like normal.

It's not the fairest thing, but in the entertainment business your value and star power and how much your employer will put up with are on the same line and they just weren't that important to ABC for the unwanted attention it was getting"
Off Camera,"They both have big contracts. In these types of roles, networks are better off cutting and running when something happens so they can move to the next ones and pay them less."
Off Camera,Not a good image for the company to coddle openly cheating professionals. Maybe if they kept it hidden and wasn't outed in the public
Off Camera,Because they cheated on their family and showcased how proud they were about it…?
Off Camera,Would be cringe to watch them now.
Off Camera,You had the guy also fucking interns. That was probably the final nail in the coffin for them.
Off Camera,"ABC is owned by Disney.  Disney is a company that likes to promote traditional wholesome family values.  Two mildly rising stars in your news organization who both cheated on their spouses doesn’t support that image, and if/when they split it will cause drama on air, especially as the show they were on was light hearted and celebrity news.  Not good having your anchors be the news.  It is best to cut your losses and break away from the drama and move on."
Off Camera,"Became, not because."
Off Camera,"This comment really fell apart in the last paragraph. Started off so strong, too."
Off Camera,"Let's imagine you work as an assistant to Robach, and now you gotta do all this extra work, that isn't in your job description, for Holmes because of their triste.

See how that can become a problem really quickly?  

Fraternizing can affect other people in the business in a really negative way, and that isn't fair to them."
Off Camera,What does v2 mean
Off Camera,I’d argue they were excellent on-screen and people at that level are hard to replace. Just watch any local news program to see what mid-level on-screen talent looks like. These two were at the top of their game. I’m actually bummer they’re leaving because I liked them on GMA and I don’t watch it for the morals.
Off Camera,Do they get severance in instances like this?
Off Camera,Jerry springer
Off Camera,[deleted]
Off Camera,So who are considered stars?
Off Camera,That doesn't explain anything
Off Camera,How did they showcase it?
Off Camera,if it was off camera how is that showcasing?
Off Camera,Never heard of them before but good for them!
Off Camera,And that's anyone's concern how?
Off Camera,That must be one of these American things that I can't understand. Why would that be the company's business or ground for termination?
Off Camera,Thank you for sensibly and respectfully making a valid point. This makes sense to me from the perspective of the corporation. But the  reaction from the public (just basing it on folks Reddit and their strong outrage) still doesn’t make sense to me.
Off Camera,Blame autocorrect
Off Camera,Would the rapist who somehow became president in 2016 be better?
Off Camera,"I guess, the moral of the story is never to post at 4am. Word salad or not, the point still stands and the fact that all of you are reaching for attacks and insults doesn’t minimize my point.

My bad, these guys should be branded with a scarlet."
Off Camera,"Version 2.

Who really cares about this off camera affair? The public has already got their fix recently."
Off Camera,"['GMA3' Ratings are Strong Amid T.J. Holmes and Amy Robach's Hiatus and Ongoing Investigation, Source Says](https://www.etonline.com/gma3-ratings-are-strong-amid-tj-holmes-and-amy-robachs-hiatus-and-ongoing-investigation-source-says)

Show's doing fine without them."
Off Camera,"These people operate at a level far above mere severance packages. Ever since the news broke, the show they host has been continues to be called ""GMA3, with your hosts TJ and Amy,"" which tells us that they weren't out yet. Surely their lawyers were fighting it out with the network's lawyers, and if the shows intro hadn't mentioned them, it probably would have been seen as firing them, thus violating their contract. 

The network would have cited the rite to cancel the contracts under the ""moral turpitude"" clause, and the stars' lawyers would have reminded them that simply having an adult relationship while separated from their spouses wouldn't have qualified as a violation of moral turpitude. 

So the network wanted them gone, but were bound by their contracts, and the stars' lawyers have been busy negotiating golden parachutes for them."
Off Camera,"If it becomes a scandal that distracts from the company mission, then no they can't."
Off Camera,"Glorifying infidelity?, gotcha...👀"
Off Camera,Plenty of employers have rules or restrictions on relationships between coworkers.  Plus ABC is trying to sell “wholesome” and “family centric” as their brand so yeah I can understand
Off Camera,They fucked with the money. Don’t fuck with the money.
Off Camera,"Username checks out.

Relationships in the workplace is a contentious issue.

Many companies don't care as long as it doesn't affect power dynamics or it doesn't negatively affects the company publicly."
Off Camera,"Depends on the company, many discourage fraternizing and you gotta report it to HR.  

Unless you're at Dunder Mifflin, then it's fair game."
Off Camera,"It's not really an ""American thing"" most large companies around the world have a morality clause. Gotta keep up the company image when you represent the company."
Off Camera,"He also had multiple affairs with people at work, including an intern. Instant no no."
Off Camera,Also they are co workers if he had been in a role above her weird power dynamic shit would come into play and you don’t wanna send the message that’s okay
Off Camera,Because who wants those kind of people working for their company?
Off Camera,"Morning news anchors want to present a strong family picture.  The core audience after all is stay at home moms.  If the cute blonde anchor that you thought was sweet and innocent and had her life together and had a life that was wonderful and happy and the handsome muscular man wearing a perfectly put together suit turned out to both be lying cheating bastards, you would turn away.  They broke the image of the perfect family (The Today show was for a long time using the tag line “America’s First Family-TODAY on NBC”)."
Off Camera,"Relax. The comment above was edited after I commented. It was word salad with ketchup for dressing. Still is, really, but whatever."
Off Camera,Clinton? But bill Clinton was also an accused rapist.
Off Camera,What does that have to do with anything. Rape is a crime. It’s not the same as two consenting adults having an affair. It hurts families for sure but it’s none of our business.
Off Camera,Or it could be people tuning in to see if anyone mentions them....
Off Camera,Why would it become a scandal?
Off Camera,"I'm not American, but I'm tired of the superiority showboating people do in the thinly veiled guise of ""asking an honest question""."
Off Camera,In many countries an affair wouldn't affect the company image at all. People just won't care.
Off Camera,"I love that interoffice relationships are included in the morality clause, but corporate ethics vs. profit mandates or not. In other words, it’s really important that you always make the company appear to be moral, but let’s look the other way when it comes to doing the right thing, even if it means affecting profits a little."
Off Camera,"That's a more serious allegation, but I haven't seen that in the article."
Off Camera,"Yeah, to me if you want to have an affair that's your business I guess. 

But if you're too dumb to properly hide it, that I can't tolerate. 

These two were anchors on a national morning show and yet they ran around like nobody would know who they were. That's too stupid to remain employed."
Off Camera,There’s a suggestion here if you have an affair you just should be unemployed which is way overly harsh. At that point you might as well just send people to jail for having an affair
Off Camera,Anyone who has to present a strong family picture to tell me about the news is somebody I DON'T WANT to hear from when it comes to the news. For the very fact that they have supposedly strong family values is what makes them incapable of presenting the news balanced fairly and accurately. All it makes them is stooges for right wing Republican bullshit. It makes them the enemy of all truly morality. Family values is and always and forever will be total bullshit!
Off Camera,Because they were both married. And apparently Holmes had sex inside is office with another junior employee a few years ago.
Off Camera,"Well they were both married to other people, that usually does it. Reporters aren’t meant to be the story."
Off Camera,Because they were both married to other people while the affair was going on.
Off Camera,“Why?” isn’t even the right question because it did become a scandal.
Off Camera,Are you serious? People ask that way because it’s hard to convey intent over the Internet and people want to ask a question without seeming like they are trolling.
Off Camera,"If you're referring to my comment, there's no superior affectation at all in my intention. I'm just from a country that has routinely re-elected presidents who were known for having affairs, and where terminating employees for having affairs would result in lawsuit and massive compensation from the courts. So, yes, I'm honestly asking because I just can't understand it, why would a company fire people for having affairs (between adults)?"
Off Camera,When an affair exposes the spouse to risk of stds they didn't consent to I tend to see it as a form of sexual assault.
Off Camera,"Exposing someone to the risk of an std without their knowledge and gaining consent to sex under the fraudulent pretense of monogamy seems like it should carry some weight behind it. This is assuming you continue a sexual relationship with the original partner. 

It takes a level of sociopathy to hand waive cheating. That's not hyperbole. I'd rather be mugged than be cheated on especially if it was for an extended period of time in a relationship. That can amount to years of your life being fundamentally a lie."
Off Camera,"Oh oof, thanks for informing me"
Off Camera,Oh. This information was unknown to me. I take it all back lol
Off Camera,Dude chillax I didn't know they were married. I'm getting so many downvotes for not knowing information very sad
Off Camera,"They would fire them because they broke their contract. Whether or not the public cares, the employer does and they have people sign contracts saying they won't do whatever behavior they find unappealing. The people would lose a lawsuit because there are contracts in place. This isn't just American companies, futbol teams all over the world have the players sign similar contracts. Politicians are elected officials, they aren't beholden to corporate standards or contracts even in America (just look at Trump or Clinton)."
Off Camera,"Because they’re public facing individuals whose job is to report the news, not become the news. Elections are one thing, that’s the people selecting a government. Public representation of your corporation is another thing, and if you fuck that up in any way in a public facing role I’m sure you can still be fired in your country, even if the reason you fucked it up (like having an affair) is apparently normally protected.

Like if Jim from sales and Pam from administration have an affair I’m sure that’s totally fine. But if your two lead anchors have an affair and become the story instead of presenting the story, then I’m sure that’s still a problem no matter the work place protections. They’re not being fired because of the affair. They’re being fired for the public fallout of the affair reflecting badly on the parent company."
Off Camera,"Because it means they're shitty human beings lol.

Fuck off out of here."
Off Camera,LPT: when a relationship is referred to as an “affair” it’s because one or all of the parties are married to someone else.
Off Camera,"TFA doesn't mention any contract being broken.

Also, show me a football club in Europe where players can't have affairs otherwise they'll be fired? I think the courts will have a field day with that."
Off Camera,If Jim from sales and Pam from administration had an affair then we’ve got ourselves a multi Emmy award winning television series
Off Camera,"And yet Joe Scarborough and Mika Brezinski weren't fired, and their story didn't embarass or harm their company, quite the contrary. 

Also, TFA mentions that this could be legally tricky for ABC:

> ABC News may have to thread a needle, proving via legal means that the pair behaved unprofessionally at work.

So any legal reason is just a retroactive attempt at justification.

> and if you fuck that up in any way in a public facing role I’m sure you can still be fired in your country, even if the reason you fucked it up (like having an affair) is apparently normally protected.

Sure, for all sorts of reasons. Except having an affair. That's nobody's business here (France) and a private matter between the two people and their families. And that's why I can't understand it, and so far none of the explanations have been convincing and are contradicted by TFA, since it's neither a legal reason, nor a contract reason. It's purely a cultural reason."
Off Camera,"So what? That's their business and the business of their family, who are the only ones harmed. Why do you care who they're sleeping with, if they're not your spouse?

If shitty human beings was a criteria, not a lot of people would find work."
Off Camera,Thank
Off Camera,They absolutely had a contact in place. Futbol teams have morality clauses that don't necessarily include affairs as an offense. Every company is different.

BUNKD,I didn’t know this show was still going. It’s kinda cool that Jessie in one way or another has lasted so long. Are any of the og Jessie cast still in it though?
BUNKD,"Bunk'd feels like a starter pack for a Disney channel family friendly sit-com but Idk I kind of like it for some reason. Am

Even thought it has the god forsaken laugh track it could be worse."
BUNKD,"I don't believe so. For a hot sec the show seemed to be ending as the remaining OG kids were leaving. Or at least, Skai Jackson assumed it was ending. Disney Channel then renewed it for another season and just added to the cast to fill the gaps. I suppose it's been going ever since."
Voltron: Legendary Defender,"The show's being created by three of the best artists/writers/directors from *Avatar: The Last Airbender* and *The Legend of Korra*, as well as animated by Studio Mir!

Lauren Montgomery, Tim Hendrick, and Joaquim Dos Santos (he got the nickname ""Dr. Fight"", for his amazing choreographed fight seqeunces)

Voltron: Legendary Defender,Nostalgic goosebumps!
Voltron: Legendary Defender,"All those moving parts, must be a nightmare for maintenance "
Voltron: Legendary Defender,Deadpool must be so excited right now.
Voltron: Legendary Defender,Aren't those the same animations used for assembly in the original? Nice nod for the 80's kids.

Voltron: Legendary Defender,"I'm diggin' the new robot design. The lions are a bit more round and organic, as opposed to how they would form into rectangular modulated parts. And they even kept the different orientations of Red and Green!. "
Voltron: Legendary Defender,"Okay Hulu, time to reboot Tranzor-Z!"
Voltron: Legendary Defender,I'm 30 and gonna watch this.
Voltron: Legendary Defender,"I got nostalgic when I saw Voltron released on DVD in the special cases years ago, tried to go home and watch them and they were horrible. Childhood partially damaged. "
Voltron: Legendary Defender,"I saw it.
It's a lion."
Voltron: Legendary Defender,"This looks great, makes me wish they could pick up the new Thundercats and renew it for another season, that show was cut short too quickly. "
Voltron: Legendary Defender,"Netflix,  you're making me more and more glad I started subscribing almost 15 years ago,  it's always paid off. 

Now? You made my year with this, Daredevil season 2, and who knows what else. Just give me the extended cut off Kingdom of Heaven and I'll be happy"
Voltron: Legendary Defender,"Yay! And thankfully, it's not that shitty car Voltron!

Worst disappointment of my childhood life, sitting down with a bowl of cereal all excited for Voltron, and it turns out to be fucking ToyotaTron instead. I actually cried."
Voltron: Legendary Defender,"Absurdly long assembly sequence?  Yep, that's legit Voltron."
Voltron: Legendary Defender,I look forward to watching that entire animation at least once per episode.
Voltron: Legendary Defender,I really hope they redo the toys. 
Voltron: Legendary Defender,So you're telling me they form like Voltron and the Rza in not the head?
Voltron: Legendary Defender,"""And I'll form the head!"" heck yeah! "
Voltron: Legendary Defender,"I grew up in the late 80's and my parents couldn't afford cable but occasionally, we'd get to go to the video store and rent a few movies and I chose the same three Voltron videos they had every time for nearly a year straight.

My daughter loves Power Rangers so I think this will be an easy sell."
Voltron: Legendary Defender,Lets keep this giant robot train rolling come on Symbiotic Titan.
Voltron: Legendary Defender,All you little power ranger nerds gonna learn!

Voltron: Legendary Defender,Transformation!
Voltron: Legendary Defender,Yaaaaaaaaaassssssssssss
Voltron: Legendary Defender,"I really REALLY hope its more than just the FORM BLAZING SWORD - ONE HIT KILL! that the old show was. 

I mean they'd set up these cool monsters and then the moment voltron comes out its poof back to the drawing board without any real fight. "
Voltron: Legendary Defender,I haven't been this excited about a new series in my entire life. I literally welled up a little when I watched this trailer.
Voltron: Legendary Defender,I loved watching Voltron growing up! So excited for this!!
Voltron: Legendary Defender,Activate Interlock!
Voltron: Legendary Defender,"on one hand this looks really cool, on the other hand my nostalgia filter is screaming about it."

Voltron: Legendary Defender,"Netflix is really going all out, huh?"
Voltron: Legendary Defender,~~Ryan Reynolds/Wade Wilson~~ Deadpool is gonna be so stoked.
Voltron: Legendary Defender,This was my favorite cartoon growing up followed closely by Dungeons and Dragons. I hope they do it justice.
Voltron: Legendary Defender,"Honestly curious, but is this meant to be kind of joking and facetious or is this a serious cartoon?"
Voltron: Legendary Defender,"My only 'complaint' was that I didn't get to hear the sweet-ass Voltron music. I cannot wait for this, and I didn't even know it was coming until now!
"
Voltron: Legendary Defender,"I remember loving voltron, but remember very little from it. I feel that will be perfect for enjoying this reboot. "
Voltron: Legendary Defender,Why does the teasing feeling happen inside me?
Voltron: Legendary Defender,Wow. This looks amazing! 
Voltron: Legendary Defender,"If every transformation takes that long, there isn't going to be much room for anything else"
Voltron: Legendary Defender,Is that animated by the same people who did Appleseed? It looks eerily familiar. 
Voltron: Legendary Defender,"Umm, I think it's a giant robot, with an ice cream cone for one of it's arms. I think."
Voltron: Legendary Defender,What a time to be alive.
Voltron: Legendary Defender,"One plus one plus one plus one plus one?

(If this gets reverse dubbed into a Golion sequel I'd find it hilarious.)"
Voltron: Legendary Defender,"Never watched Voltron, but I'm a fan of anime, and this seems very similar, both in style and content... so I'll have to check it out. The casting and people involved in the project are certainly impressive!"
Voltron: Legendary Defender,Does anyone know if it is possible to watch this show without Netflix? I know it says only on Netflix but I thought maybe they sell season later on.
Voltron: Legendary Defender,When our forces combine!  So glad this is not CGI
Voltron: Legendary Defender,This had better have Peter Cullen's 'Mighty Robot' prologue intro. 
Voltron: Legendary Defender,The fact that Steven Yuen has time for this show makes me wonder what's in the near future for Glen on Walking Dead!
Voltron: Legendary Defender,"Lions look as cartoons but should they ever make a motion picture, I hope its based on Vehicle Voltron

"
Voltron: Legendary Defender,"omg it comes out on my birthday, best birthday ever!"
Voltron: Legendary Defender,looks like something from Power Rangers
Voltron: Legendary Defender,Aww hell yeah.
Voltron: Legendary Defender,"I remember watching Voltron as a kid, it was the coolest fucking shit every."
Voltron: Legendary Defender,"From what I've seen, the characters look VERY similar to the original series.

The Yellow Lion guy being a ""Heavy""    
The Green Lion being almost like a Kid, etc.

I was working with some guys in Dreamworks IT the other day on something and the only conference room they could find on short notice for the size we needed happened to also be the Voltron Team's War Room.  So there were stills from the first 8 episodes all over one wall and some of the marketing release items on another wall.  I'll be curious to see if their plans for next week get followed through on."
Voltron: Legendary Defender,"""series not yet rated"" ends up being cartoon porn"
Voltron: Legendary Defender,Not digging that new symbol/light on Voltron's chest. Very excited about this series. 
Voltron: Legendary Defender,My childhood has a boner. I used to race home after school just to watch this.
Voltron: Legendary Defender,"Always wondered since I was a kid why, during battle, would you take however many long minutes to go from Lion mode to Robot mode. Why not be Robot mode all the time, you turn into it every episode. There must be some cordial motherfucking enemies to wait while you turn into a badass to defeat them."
Voltron: Legendary Defender,Scenes like this really don't work without some properly hype music.
Voltron: Legendary Defender,This was my fave show when I wasn't even old enough to pronounce it right (Botron). I'm about to turn 35 and I couldn't be more excited.
Voltron: Legendary Defender,"I can't speak for anyone else who grew up in the eighties but Voltron, Robotech, Transformers and Gobots were my jam. Also G.I. Joe, and He-Man were pretty awesome too. Though anything that transformed was the coolest. Maybe that's why I like things to be multifunctional so much. "
Voltron: Legendary Defender,"Looks awesome. Except that new music was completely out of place
"
Voltron: Legendary Defender,Wtf are they actually making this? I'll watch if for nostalgia's sake only.
Voltron: Legendary Defender,"As someone who was a child in the 80's and loved Voltron, I can't wait!!!!"
Voltron: Legendary Defender,"I definitely gotta catch this. 

Also, I love how that combination sequence actually shows the locking mechanisms that hold the Black Lion's paws in place when Blue and Yellow slide onto his hind legs to form Voltron's legs. Hell, all the internal mechanism details are fun to see."
Voltron: Legendary Defender,Ooooooohhhhh man this show was jam back in the day. The  nostalgia is real. 
Voltron: Legendary Defender,Whatever. Animators need to be more selective in their projects. This looks good visually but the same people making it could be aligned with a much better story
Voltron: Legendary Defender,"While Voltron is cool and all, I really hope Netflix just brings back Megas XLR"
Voltron: Legendary Defender,"Oh Voltron, I loved you as a kid, but I betrayed you and sided with Prince Lotor. As a 20-something now, Rewatched both seasons, enduring migraines from endless plot and character holes. I do not regret my decision.  The original unedited Japanese Voltron had the most consistent story and was not for kids. Go-Lion was the best Voltron ever told."
Voltron: Legendary Defender,Deadpool will be pleased.
Voltron: Legendary Defender,Yayyyyyy
Voltron: Legendary Defender,The 8 year old inside me just squealed with delight....Waits for it.... Waits for it......
Voltron: Legendary Defender,Is there anything Disney doesn't own?
Voltron: Legendary Defender,God I love the shit out of voltron. I remember subbing to hulu years ago just to watch that and gigantor on the constant. 
Voltron: Legendary Defender,Yaay a Mega-Zord!!
Voltron: Legendary Defender,Does this count as the second reboot or the third? 
Voltron: Legendary Defender,I'm going to love sharing part my childhood with my kids when this comes out.
Voltron: Legendary Defender,Bringing my childhood back
Voltron: Legendary Defender,Wasn't there a voltron reboot recently where they were training some cadets to pilot voltron and all the other tigers could be the main one with different abilities?
Voltron: Legendary Defender,"Yep, I peed a little."
Voltron: Legendary Defender,"First time hearing of this! Awesome!

Hopefully it's the original crew - Keith, Lance, Pidge, Hunk and Sven. "
Hibana: Spark,Midnight Diner: Tokyo Stories
Hibana: Spark,Gomorra
Hibana: Spark,3% was phenomenal
Hibana: Spark,"There's a French comedy called A Very Secret Service that is good fun. Not a huge rate of laughs per minute and the humor is very traditional, but it's full of charm and does have occasional laugh out loud moments. "
Hibana: Spark,narcos. Most of it is in spanish
Hibana: Spark,I just finished watching Ajin and really enjoyed that. The English voice acting was fine if you don't want to read subtitles and the animation style takes a bit to get used to but it had some truly epic action sequences. 
Hibana: Spark,Club de Cuervos (México) is pretty funny.
Hibana: Spark,"I really enjoyed Terrace House. It felt very refreshing to have a reality show that wasn't entirely staged and filled with drama, maybe it is due to the cultural differences but it felt very laid back and calming when compared to Western reality shows. Also the panel that critique the residents are savage which always makes me laugh."
Hibana: Spark,Loved Lilyhammer
Hibana: Spark,"""Bad Guys"", Korean TV show. This former cop is brought back to solve a brutal set of murders, and with the police outmatched and support lacking, he brings in three convicted felons to help him. Lot of action, great acting by the four characters, and just really fun overall.

""Iris"", also Korean. Spies, North and South Korean tensions, assassinations, betrayal, lots of action. Just ignore the last 15 or so seconds before the credits (because it's a fucking travesty). There's also a spin off, Athena: Goddess of War, and a sequel, Iris II, which I'm diving into shortly. 

"
Hibana: Spark,"Grand Hotel. I wasn't planning to watch anything non-English at all, but I was hooked within minutes after clicking on to it out of curiosity. The best way to describe it is ""Downton Abbey on steroids."" It is every genre all-in-one. The main couple has so much tension. The set and the clothes are to die for. I binged the whole show (abt 50 episodes) in two weeks! Because of Grand Hotel I'm now way more interested in Spanish productions. "
Hibana: Spark,"Occupied. (on Netflix)

Summary: Near-future. The EU is facing a recession and climbing oil prices. Russia invades Norway under the disguise of helping them increase oil production. Despite being small and isolated, Norway fights back.

Great acting and cast. Interesting commentary on culture clash, the conflict between politics and ethics, and how much the B.S. the public will accept before people start mobilizing on their own."
Hibana: Spark,"Les Revenants best ""zombie"" show I've seen with an incredible soundtrack by Mogwai"
Hibana: Spark,"* [3%](https://www.netflix.com/title/80074220)

Hibana: Spark,Samurai Gourmet is a good easygoing show. 
Hibana: Spark,"Occupied

Russia invades Norway.  No one comes to help."
Hibana: Spark,"Top and bottom for me.

Train to Busan (Movie) is pretty good and Fear Files (Series) is not good"
Hibana: Spark,"Boys Over Flowers - Basically, any show on Netflix with Lee Min Ho.
"
Hibana: Spark,[deleted]
Hibana: Spark,Spiral.  especially first season
Hibana: Spark,"3%

Midnight Diner: Tokyo Stories"
Hibana: Spark,"The UK version of *Shameless*, not strictly a foreign-language but if you don't turn the subtitles on you won't understand 90% of it."
Hibana: Spark,"I watched the 3% and if you're into dystopian YA stuff it scratches the itch pretty well. It's slightly gruesome and in Portuguese with an English dub over for those interested. 


It's on Netflix."
Hibana: Spark,"Terrace house followed by 3%
Don't really consider narcos as foreign"
Hibana: Spark,Watch Spiral(French Cop show). Amazing.
Hibana: Spark,I think my favourites are The Bridge (Swedish/Danish) and Trapped (Icelandic)
Hibana: Spark,"Rita. A Danish comedy about a teacher that takes no prisoners. She treats the children like adults and the parents like children. It's funny, warm and quirky. "
Hibana: Spark,Fauda. Israeli show about a clandestine action team that works in the Gaza Strip hunting a notorious terrorist
Hibana: Spark,"Magnificent Century - It's a Turkish period drama following a Sultan of the Ottoman Empire and his harem, including conniving and fascinating Hurrem. Total guilty pleasure show since it's basically a historical fiction soap opera."
Hibana: Spark,Hotel Beau Sejour is up there with my favorite mystery shows. 
Hibana: Spark,I got very strangely addicted to Terrace House. 
Hibana: Spark,"Stranger, starring Doona-bae. "
Hibana: Spark,"It's Okay, That's Love.

Fantastic Korean drama that covers mental health. Definitely give it a try if you want to cry for two thousand years but also understand a bit more about mental illness in an easy, palpable way. "
Hibana: Spark,Hibana: Spark
Hibana: Spark,"El Internado is pretty good. A strong plot is developed early on and carries through all seasons, nothing seems particularly rushed. There are some great reveals throughout the show as well. A good show to binge watch."
Hibana: Spark,"If you're including non-Netflix Originals, One Punch Man."
Hibana: Spark,If New Zealand counts as a foreign language there's a show called Strange Calls.
Hibana: Spark,"Misfits.
"
Hibana: Spark,Amazing show. Found it so relaxing. I was watching during exam season as a sort of meditation every night before I went to bed.
Hibana: Spark,You should check out Samurai Gourmet.
Hibana: Spark,"This is what I was going to post too.  It's the most chill, wholesome, relaxing show.  The food looks amazing too.  I loved this show."
Hibana: Spark,Amazing show. I've contemplated getting the Sundance channel just to watch the second season. I know it's on YouTube but the quality is so shitty. I'd rather wait than ruin the experience of watching it like that. 
Hibana: Spark,Such a visceral show! Second season was brutal. Patiently waiting for the 3rd.
Hibana: Spark,"Music and it's scoring is great, shots are great, plotline is great if you love crime dramas. Definitely on stands toe to toe with any crime show in English. If you enjoy it, also try Romanzo Criminale La Serie"
Hibana: Spark,Is it getting a second seaaon?
Hibana: Spark,"I love this show so much, and it's terrible how little attention it got."
Hibana: Spark,"If you enjoyed Narcos, try ""El Chapo"". Very good as well."
Hibana: Spark,I don't think that counts as a foreign language then.
Hibana: Spark,"Definitely. A lot of Anime viewers go the elitist route and refuse to watch based on the CG, but they're totally missing out. Sato is one of the best antagonists I've ever seen in a show. 

Bon Voyage."
Hibana: Spark,ajin s1 was kind of a slog since the MC didnt want to get involved for most of it. S2 was great though and made up for it.
Hibana: Spark,I thought I was the only one who watched this! I found that a lot of the humor translated really well. Plus the intro sequence is pretty dope.
Hibana: Spark,[deleted]
Hibana: Spark,"I read your comment earlier today and then binge watched the first three episodes of ""Bad Guys"". I am LOVING this show! Huge thank you for, not only posting about it, but writing such an enticing show description. I never, in a million years, would have discovered this show if wasn't for you. Thanks!"
Hibana: Spark,"Yes! I always recommend this - it's melodramatic and ridiculous but so so engrossing.  I personally describe it as Downton meets Poirot* meets a daytime soap. It is absurd but just so enjoyable.  Doesn't help that the main couple are super attractive and the show itself is gorgeous.  Also, it's 3 seasons, completed, and ends with a satisfying finale.

Here's a trailer with subtitles:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_6KL7RY3pg

*No, literally, it's Poirot.  An English teenager named Agatha shows up in season 2 staying at this hotel and is inspired by how awesome the quirky Spanish detective is.  As I said, the show can be a little silly."
Hibana: Spark,"I don't watch much foreign tv on Netflix, but I really liked *Okkupert* (it's name in Norwegian). The second season comes out this fall in Norway, don't know when it'll come to Netflix. "
Hibana: Spark,"Just finished that, was really solid. Ended kind of abruptly, but the dynamic between K and Yeo Woon-gwang was fantastic. "
Hibana: Spark,this is on my list! I've watched some other Israeli tv but mostly films on Netflix and what I can see in theaters - have you seen anything else Israeli that you'd recommend?
Hibana: Spark,"That's what I thought as well, but I'm two episodes in, and I'm not really feeling it."
Hibana: Spark,yes
Hibana: Spark,"I'm Mexican and I can't watch these shows, it's like everything I know is wrong with my country is glorified and even more exaggerated. I've tried but I just end up cringing and wanting to leave. And I love Mexico with all my heart."
Hibana: Spark,"Korean reality shows are the kind of ""scripted"" writing that I can get on board with actually. It's like 50% pre-planned and 50% improv and just whatever the hell happens. It reminds me of British TV except the editing tends to take on a life of its own and acts as like a super sardonic narrator. "
Hibana: Spark,"I was shipping Julio and Alicia so hard! I watched all three productions with Yon Gonzalez that are available on my Netflix after watching Grand Hotel. Before I'd never consider watching anything Spanish-language because the telenovellas I've seen on American TV all looked pretty lame, I guess GH is different cuz it was actually made in Spain."
Hibana: Spark,Sweet. I check Netflix every few months but I guess I'll wait out the summer.
Hibana: Spark,Relax. Have a cold beer. 
Hibana: Spark,Welcome to literally everything tv and film that's not a documentary.
Hibana: Spark,"what about Club de Cuervos?

so over the top, great script and characters and makes fun of a lot of silly people.  

it's my favorite, from the opening credits and music.  "
Hibana: Spark,"I think the major difference is that Western reality television seems to be based on drama and conflict (negative emotions), and Korean reality television seems to focus on humor and heart-warming stories. I'm cool with the scripting; I imagine all reality shows worldwide are not spontaneous at all."
Hibana: Spark,[deleted]
Hibana: Spark,"Actually many documentaries are exagerrated I,manipulative, or just plain fake as well. Werner Herzog who has made some incredible documentaries fabricated many parts. "
Hibana: Spark,"Ah, a favorite. :D"
Hibana: Spark,"Running Man and Knowing Bros are my shit, korean reality shows are dangerously addictive and the *ultimate* cure for boredom. "

Stories by Rabindranath Tagore,He looks like Isaac Newton
Stories by Rabindranath Tagore,Oh dude. The homages to the satanic panic that went on during the 80's and 90's is very strong in this season.
Stories by Rabindranath Tagore,"I implore people to look into the case past the heavily edited biased paradise lost documentaries. There really isn't any doubt to actual law enforcement that Damien and the boys did this. The knife in baldwins lake, the broken bottle where misskelly one said it'd be, the fibers from damiens rug, Damien straight up bragging to multiple people about the murders and having no alibi, damien being certified mentally ill and obsessed with blood, damien had a bloody necklace with steven branch and baldwins blood on it, steven branch had blue candlewax on him matching a blue candle of damiens, three distinct knots were used, one on each victim, implying that each were tied up by 3 different people, damien seen covered in mud waking with baldwin, all their alibis were false and echols had like 4 of them with one girl ratting him out as lying, damien bragging at a aoftball game, damien literally being in an institution for ""suicidal and homicidal urges"". Oh and he violently murdered a sick dog for the fun of it. 

There's a reason they weren't truly exonerated and signed Alford statements(which literallt admits culpability). Misskelly confessed multiple times with details only the killer would know. Damien wasn't just some poor metal head, dude was a fucking psycho who was institutionalized and when a random kid cut himself he'd suck his arm. He had an extreme fetish for blood and black Magick which he still rambles on about today. He's a true Satanist, not an athiest Satanist. 

Anyone interested in this case should look at the links i peovide. There's no way they're innocent. There was an even better blog called wm3truth.com which was around for years and had all sources and the whole case analyzed though its now only on wayback machine. I posted a video as well with all the info laid out. There's really no way to believe their innocence after going through these facts which the documentary completely omitted. Also it shows how the accusers of Hobbs were all serial felons/rapists with financial incentive to be on the documentary, and the hair that supposedly matched him is found in 21 million americans.

 Paradise lost was the original ""making a murderer"". Its heavily skewed. Many a metal head were persecuted for crimes they didn't commit. But these kids were monsters, and I believed them as a long haired rocker my whole life until I decided to get informed. It's sick how ignorant Hollywood still enables this psycho and skewed shit out of ignorance.

Seriously anyone interested should read that blog. Even 5 minutes through its apparent they're guilty and all the sources are listed. It doesn't take long and offers indisputable evidence. There's a couple videos as well that I'm going to try to look foe and post via edit(also wm3truth if i can find an archive since it was amazinfly thorough and made by a supporter of them who realized they qere guilty). People keep projecting themselves on these kids but they weren't innocent. Damien is a psychopath, baldwin is almost as bad, and misskelly was a severe alcoholic with learning disabilities(which were made to seem worse by the creaters of the documentary to act like his confesion was coerced even though he confessed to his parents and his lawyers prior and had a mental breakdown due to guilt). He confessed initially with no coercion telling things he could never know like the smashed bottle of the exact liquor. There's an imprint on one of the kids that matches the engraving on the back of damiens knife which was thrown into misskellys lake along with a bloody necklace with baldwin and branchs dna. The fibers that were found, and him bragging about killing them and also asking a girl for an alibi. 

You guys can believe what you want but I beg you to atleast hear the facts from unbiased sources that aren't trying to make a political documentary with an agenda. There was alot of bullshit with satanic panic, and ignorance and hatred towards well meaning long haired kids. But these monsters aren't them. If you still support them after reading this then that's your decision, but don't blindly support admitted child killers. Damien bragged about it. He was and still is a legitimate Satanist. Not a Satanist as in atheist critiquing religion but a psycho who worships the real satan(well he's not real but you know what I mean) with an extreme interest in black Magick. He did this because he genuinely thought it'd bring him power due to his mental illness that he was in multiple institutions for. He was diagnosed a psychopath and still wrote about black Magick in prison and still does to this day(Magick is bs but he thinks it's real). 

Eddie is awesome. He's a good man albeit eccentric. He's no Damien Echols. They may have been inspired by the false version of events but the west memphis 3 are no victims. Only Misskelly is sympathetic due to being coerced into taking part but they're all child murderers. And I can say that confidently. This is one case that is truly black and white if you just step back and stop thinking of them as you or your friends just cuz you liked metal music too. It has nothing to do with their taste in music or hairstyles and everything to do with being psycho murderers. Eddie doesn't deserve to be killed by the mob but too bad Damien Echols wasn't. Dude deserves to rot in hell.

Here's the links again and a couple more.

The guy who killed animals? The guy who even after all these years can't provide an alibi? The lies of those HBO ""documentaries"" really run deep and I must admit I am kind of disgusted with people who still support this pos."
Stories by Rabindranath Tagore,I got those vibes and it instantly made me angry.
Stories by Rabindranath Tagore,Who's that
Stories by Rabindranath Tagore,Echols could be guilty for all we know.
Stories by Rabindranath Tagore,I knew it!!  I grew up in a small town east of there and I remember my mother being so worried for me and my brothers when this went down because we wore black and played DND and didn’t go to church. She never believed those guys did it. I’m glad she lived long enough to see them get out of prison. The mid 80’s was also the time of satanic cults running daycares so they could sacrifice babies. The ‘80’s were weird. I love stranger things because the nostalgia is so strong.
Stories by Rabindranath Tagore,That guy that ripped off a bunch of people on Kickstarter??
Stories by Rabindranath Tagore,Satanic panic was stupid.
Stories by Rabindranath Tagore,"I immediately turned around to my wife and said they are channeling the west Memphis three right now. 

I actually nearly didn't make it through the first episode as that was a really hard thing for me to follow, that could have just as easily been me growing up playing D&D and Warhammer listening to metal in a small town. Following that case was so fucking tough but it became a real thing for me when I first moved to the US especially because I was a complete devotee of Henry Rollins who took up their cause. 

I'm glad I stuck with it but Jesus there's a lot of feels in this season."
Stories by Rabindranath Tagore,"Everybody who only watched Paradise Lost, and are convinced of this kids innocence (just as I was at one point), needs to go listen to ""the case against"" by Gary Meece... I'd recommend checking out EP 59, titled ""the bible confession"" which details Jessie Miskelley confessing to his own lawyers as well as to police AFTER his trial on the way to prison. And then I would look into Roberta Glass who also delves deeper into the facts of the case that the documentary conveniently left out. 

I was convinced of Damien's innocence for a time too. I'm not trying to be condescending... Just look into it more. 

It makes me physically ill seeing this dude receive any sort of praise. 

I'm not at all religious. I don't care about occultism or satanism or any form of religion. I truly don't. The facts are what I'm interested in and I hope more people seek the facts outside of that biased film... Look at Damien's past BEFORE the murders. He was an animal abuser. He was violent. This psycho blew a kiss at the kids parents during trial. 

Just go research this shit deeper. Please. This is sick.

Stories by Rabindranath Tagore,This show sucks now
Stories by Rabindranath Tagore,Damien Echols 😍😍 this story is INCREDIBLE and so heartbreaking. Paradise lost: the west Memphis 3 is a greattttt documentary film but heads up.. it’s gonna piss you tf off.
Stories by Rabindranath Tagore,I grew up in a town close to West Memphis (about an hour away). I’m a little younger than him but I remember a cop in my home town telling me he “could ruin my life” when I was 16 because I rattled my exhaust on Main Street. I didn’t hurt anyone. I was just young. It really made me see what they could do to your life. I was lucky bc I was white and a letterman basketball player. It really turned my head on what authority is. It’s all fabricated. If you believe then you’ve been deceived. That dude has had a hard life.

This is a really well put together video series discussing the West Memphis Three case. Highly recommend checking it out. It touches on a lot of the evidence and facts left out of the documentary. 

I am not religious. I have nothing against satanism or anything like that. Christianity has arguably been far worse in our society and poses a bigger threat to the average person than Satanism. I thought Damien, Jason, and Jessie were innocent for years based on the documentary, until I was exposed to new information that the documentary films left out.


Here are some more links that include court testimony, Echols psychiatric medical records, physical evidence, and more.

Stories by Rabindranath Tagore,Way too believable if you grew up in that time.
Stories by Rabindranath Tagore,You rang?
Stories by Rabindranath Tagore,I definitely yelled out “omg Satanic Panic!!” and pointed at the screen like that Leo meme.
Stories by Rabindranath Tagore,"I'll point out that in real life, unlike what was presented on the show, there were in fact no supernatural beings from other planes running around killing people, and it's really unfortunate that the show plays into it at all. If you were to blame Satan for the murders on the show, it wouldn't be an outlandish fabrication of moral panic, it would just be mistaken identity. Which makes it somewhat unfortunate that they went that route at all. Similar to Wandavision and the Salem Witch Trials. In the real world, there were no witches with magical powers, just innocent people and angry neighbors with dead victims at the end of it. Confirming that there were witches with evil intentions and magical powers is a pretty yikes choice to make, even if fictional.

Edit: Let me guess, some of you downvoting me believe media should do things like give positive traits to racial minority characters or feature LGBTQ+ individuals instead of an entirely straight cast, but for some reason it's a step too far to suggest we don't play into the lies of historical tragedies that resulted in destroyed lives because...  what? You enjoyed it? Or it's okay here because you think for some reason it won't have an impact, but it does when it comes to the 8 billionth poorly written woman?"

Stories by Rabindranath Tagore,"Actually.. if you look into it properly and deeper than just the tv documentaries.. there is a shit ton of stuff pointing towards Damien actually doing this. I was convinced they were innocent at first too, not so much  now"
Stories by Rabindranath Tagore,The people who point fingers at the step dad are just as bad as the people who point fingers at the three. There's more evidence against the three than there is Hobbs but people just believe that because the 3rd HBO documentary was having to grasp at straws.
Stories by Rabindranath Tagore,"pretty sure the west memphis three was guilty as hell and it had nothing to do with satanism. 

ALL the evidence poionts directly at them. Damien lied to the police about his whereabouts when asked originally. then he told them a different lie when that lie got found out. Then when they did the documentary he told yet another lie. 

To this day he has never explained where he was during the murders nor why he keeps lying about his whereabouts. An eye witness places him very near the crime almost directly after it happened walking down the road with dirt on his pants (the murder scene was muddy) 

He literally confessed to friends about having committed the murder multiple times totally unprompted. The one suspect who everyone keeps trying to say was mentally incompetent was a perfectly normal teen, passed high school, had jobs, had a girlfriend, etc. 

The jury convicted them due to the evidence, not because the police were screaming about satanic panic which didn't even enter the jur y trial at all. 

They were guilty, I firmly believe that."

Those three are guilty and there is no question about it for anyone who is open to the facts and the truth. 

I get it man, I watched the documentary years back. I was a little more angsty at the time and anti establishment and anti Christianity, not to mention naive, so of course it was feasible that the town set these boys up. 

For some reason this case sparked an interest in me a few months back and I started actually looking into the details and felt so stupid for ever letting that documentary convince me that this was some sort of witch hunt. The filmmakers did a good job. And satanic panic was (and still is) real. But those 3 murdered those little boys and the fandom and support they receive to this day makes me sick."

The Deep,Lmao how does he keep a straight face doing these takes
The Deep,[deleted]
The Deep,That's Timothy... He's my friend.
The Deep,I love how every sea creature he has interacted with has died lol
The Deep,The latest YouTube video about him is fucking hilarious. Real eyes realise real lies
The Deep,As a cowboys fan I think it’s so funny that he’s Tony Romo’s brother in law lol I can imagine Tony asking him about work and Chase is like “I fucked a variety of sea creatures so” and Tony is like “….got it”
The Deep,"> This isn't even mentioning the fact that he has a fetish for sea creatures that can't very well consent to his fantasies.

Isn’t he able to talk to sea creatures? It was very clear to me that it was all consensual."
The Deep,"Give

Him

A

Speedo

You

Cowards"
The Deep,">This isn't even mentioning the fact that he has a fetish for sea creatures that can't very well consent to his fantasies.

Isn't his whole deal that he can talk to fish? Hell, the dolphin distracted him by asking for a handy while he was breaking him out of the sea park."
The Deep,"My problem with the writers is they're terrified of killing anybody of note

Maeve and A-Train should've died and it would've been fine

I'm sure they're gonna do another fake out death with Noir too"
The Deep,"The Deep is not deep.  That's the joke.  He's dumb, he's shallow, he's easily manipulated.  His entire persona is a contradiction of his name.  Like a tall guy named Shorty or a bald man named Curly.  His ""arc"" is what-dumbass-thing-can-this-dumbass-do-to-mess-this-up?"
The Deep,Fuck Fresca
The Deep,You know.. I'm always so torn about the characters where the actor is so good at acting that they turn an evil character into some one you viscerally hate!  Like the boy who did Joffrey in GoT.. You hate them because the actor did such a good job at playing the role.  You get this mixed feelings.. like you want to like the person for being a good actor but you hate their character because they were a good actor...  You both like and hate the same person!
The Deep,Would be hilarious if The Deep delivered the final blow to Homalander during the inevitable 7 V 1 end fight. Hughie and Butcher will be 2 of the 7
The Deep,He’s the writer’s punching bag. And I’m ok with that.
The Deep,Now they are in too deep
The Deep,"I know The Deep is a fan favorite because ethe actor is loved by everyone in the show, but the writers absolutely don't know what to do with his character in-show. 

He's literally just there. That's it. His whole ""redemption"" arc was shown to play a huge role in S2, but it was reduced to a couple of scenes of him bickering with his wife here and there. 

The writers don't even know how to utilize his power anymore. I really thought his character was going to get killed in season 3 because he had zero role in that season, but he just survives somehow. 

I guess the show likes having him as a clown and a punching bag for jokes instead of actually bothering to write something good for him."
The Deep,"Now if they could just dial back the frequency with which Hughie says he's sorry, that would be great."
The Deep,"I still kinda wish they updated the jokes.  ""lol aquaman has silly powers"" feels like a super old, super worn out joke.

The ""real"" aquaman already made the same observations, and switched up the character to Biker Merman played by Jason Momoa.  The Boys should be riffing on THAT version.

Have The Deep show up with tattoos, heavy eyeliner, long hair, leather jacket, etc... and slowly reveal that its all a facade to battle his insecurities.  Oh, and the leather jacket is faux-leather, of course, because The Deep still loves animals.  (or maybe it's genuine leather because fuck land-animals)"
The Deep,He's funny but the jokes really got repetitive this season. He's a pushover. He fucks sea creatures. Sea creatures die on him. We get it.
The Deep,"His first main story point was being a rapist. After that, they wrote him as comic relief. It's very strange."
The Deep,He's funny but I feel like he gets way too much screentime. All of the jokes are starting to feel repetitive. Feel like the writers don't know what to do with him.
The Deep,Ironically he is the shittiest character in the series.
The Deep,"I hate the deep and I look forward to the day Starlight ends his fish fucking life.   

The actor is charming for sure,  but the chararcter is a soggy shitheel."
The Deep,"One thing the article says that I disagree with is that the deep has unconsentual sex with animals.

He can talk to them and the one scene in the third season where the octopus joins in does seem like that it's a willing participant.

He also clearly cares for sea animals more than humans, he just seems to have invested so much of himself into being homelanders pet. Like his identity relies on it.

No redemption for the deep but I reckon he will have an arc of sorts."
The Deep,The deep is my favorite character.
The Deep,"""he has a fetish for sea creatures that can't very well consent to his fantasies.""

What the hell? They can, and they do!

Watch the show FFS! He can fucking talk to them!

Damn idiot article writer."
The Deep,"I just learned about the Vought International youtube channel and they have a bunch of clips of The Deep - fuck man, the actor is amazing. Pauses, stutters, tone.....really impressed. 

The character's an idiot but the actor is a treasure."
The Deep,"Reddit already turning on this show is also hilarious, happens every time something gets popular.

The Boys subreddit is a complete shitshow, it got so bad; they had to put out statements talking about victim blaming rape victims as well as addressing Homelander's 'fans'.

Media literacy really needs to be taught in schools tbh, because I keep seeing people going 'BACK TO STATUS QUO NOTHING HAS CHANGED'. If you think nothing has changed in S3, then you're just stupid."
The Deep,Makes sense. He is the hottest.
The Deep,"I honestly thought he was going to have a character arc when it came to season 2, one that involved him becoming a good person. 

This season showed just how much that fame and power corrupts and just how much of a douche The Deep is."
The Deep,"Chace Crawford doesn’t get enough credit for 1. Portraying a coward perfectly, and 2. Being in really good shape for this role"
The Deep,"The Deep is a total piece of shit, but Chace Crawford is very charismatic."
The Deep,Honestly I would have written off Chase as some dipshit from Gossip Girl. Turns out dude is hilarious and incredibly talented.
The Deep,He r*ped someone in the first ep so there is no tasteful redemption they can do. The most you can do is make him entertaining and then have him meet a grissly end
The Deep,Chace Crawford crushes the performance. His look back when they're doing the reality show.
The Deep,Don’t get me wrong I love the boys but this whole article seems pointless. Literally just several paragraphs to say “chase is funny”
The Deep,"I don’t mind this type of favouritism. 

I do mind the type that makes a character like Soldier Boy morally ambiguous when we are consistently told he’s a piece of shit. 

Imo Kripke is too close to Ackles to write him as being too bad of a guy."
The Deep,Sounds like they're Rolling in the Deep
The Deep,So having a character be one-punch joke that became stale a season ago is playing favourites? What happens to characters they don't like
The Deep,"They've probably taken him as far as the character can go.

The writers should have the Deep echo Ezra Miller's crazy antics. 

 Make him get in fights with fans at bars in Hawaii, have him try to groom a teen, remove him from the 7, and throw him in jail"
The Deep,"If there's one ""problem"" I have with this show is the stakes are very low because they can't/are unwilling to kill off popular characters or good actors, unlike the comic where characters drop like flies."
The Deep,The Deep and A-Train both feel like dead weight on this show.
The Deep,He’s probably the one character I don’t know how they end his arch when the shows over
The Deep,Soldier Boy can't say a line while the deep is out here fucking octopuses
The Deep,I almost threw up in the episode with the talking gills. 🤮
The Deep,Dude is like a lab experiment where they mixed the genes of Brad Pitt and Ryan Reynolds.
The Deep,"“Real eyes realise Real Lies”

-The Deep"
The Deep,"Lovable, moronic sociopath."
The Deep,You gotta love the character for being so deep
The Deep,Garth Ennis wrote a far better story
The Deep,"Hilarious, the Deep gets better every season. I can’t wait to see what insane shit they come up for him."
The Deep,So happy this dude has had a bit of a positive resurgence from this show. Felt like the was always more than just a pretty face in gossip girl.
The Deep,Anyone other then me who thinks he looks like stiffler?
The Deep,"Dude's a swimbo, is all I'm saying."
The Deep,This dude is a rapist and is into beastiality Of course it’s Hollywood writers favorite character. Dude is a piece of shit.
The Deep,He’s my favorite character of the show so that’s awesome. Absolutely hilarious situations with him.
The Deep,"Deep is the Joffrey of this show. He’s so despicable, but the actor is on the fucking money"
The Deep,The more the writers talk about this show like its some sort of brilliant satire the less fun it is
The Deep,Yeah I hope he dies but apparently writing him fucking fish 5x a season is really important to Kripke.
The Deep,I just started this show and he’s one of my favorites lol
The Deep,More like filler
The Deep,Getting stale with the one note 'he fucked a fish lol' jokes.
The Deep,"Hes a boring character with zero moral redemption needed, he should be killed off in a horrendous way to put us out of our misery"
The Deep,I might be in the minority here but I check out whenever A-train or The Deep are the focal point. I’m just so sick of seeing them. A- train should’ve died when he killed that racist PoS. The Deep has some amusing moments but all in all I just do not care about him. The actors are doing a good job but I just can’t seem to get invested into either of their characters.
The Deep,I’d rather they actually have the balls to kill off some of the major good guy characters. Even in ten clm is frenchie and his Asian gf bit the bullet but the plot armor in this show is getting to Stranger Things level. I enjoy the show a lot don’t get me wrong but would like to see them do a lot more with that aspect of the show.
The Deep,Not a huge fan of the deep. Not gonna lie.
The Deep,He's so much fun to watch until you remember that he's a serial rapist.
The Deep,"I fuck with Deep. 
After all, the man was just tryna get aHEAD, like every other player in the game."
The Deep,"I want the opening scene with the deep to be home crying and listening to ""In too deep"" by Sum41"
The Deep,"The Deep is a rapist, that is all.  He needed to end."
The Deep,Now it’s time that they stop denying that their season three finale wasn’t horribly written.
The Deep,"hes a chad in the show, but wears a giant diving helmet in the comics, its weird that they changed him so much, but the shit is hilarious. when he pulls the octopi out and introduces her i die"
The Deep,In season 3 the storylines involving The Deep and those of  Mother's Milk were Reddit scrolling times.
The Deep,"I've been wanting to check this out. ""Everybody"" says it's great. I just want to make sure it's not just run of the mill MCU and DC movie and show type stuff(although I like that one with Jon Cena)."
The Deep,How does this show only have 3/5 stars on the Prime app?   It's fucking gold!!!
The Deep,"I've only seen season 1, the show is hard to watch it disturbs and makes me feel incredibly uneasy.

Which I understand is the point of the show and also I have a really fucked up sense of humor too so it should be fine for me...it just isn't. Idk why"
The Deep,"Kinda wish they wouldn't. Not anymore, anyway. All he does is sit around, mope about not having any sea stuff to do, and fuck sea creatures.

It's gotten dull."
The Deep,"I wish he never existed, what a useless boring character."
The Deep,The comments section here seems to reveal how many Avengers fans are watching this show and just wanting another corny cookie cutter Superhero Action picture.
The Deep,The deep is a pointless character. His plots are nothing but time filler. The worst parts of the show are also associated with him ie - anything to do with sea animals.
The Deep,"You wrote your favorite as a rapist
Nice"
The Deep,"I bet writing for the deep is fun, because as a character he’s horrendous, so the fact that u can write him in all these scenarios that essentially force him to do uncomfortable actions that physically, mentally, and emotionally  hurt him, is thematic and cinematic karma!! Which is awesome to watch as a viewer"
The Deep,How is this news?
The Deep,Rape and bestiality. Makes you wonder about the writers
The Deep,Thank you! My favorite character on the show by a mile. I smile whenever he has a scene. He’s so incredibly sleazy yet so weak and dopey. I’d argue to say the most human main character on the show.
The Deep,He is cute.
The Deep,"Every episode this show gets more and more fucked up


and I love it.

haven't felt like that since Game of Thrones!"
The Deep,I simp for him and I'm not ashamed to admit it
The Deep,Is that country Mac
The Deep,I wish r/theboys subreddit would stop banning people who post pictures of Annie. The actress is into some bad mojo and looks like she's 50 and on meth now. They ban anyone who post new pictures of her
The Deep,Best character on the show. Second place isn’t even close.
The Deep,"As shitty as he is, I’ve really enjoyed the comedy with the Deep. I still root against the guy but he’s great entertainment 

Maeve is the one I enjoy on screen the least. So bland and her wig is so bad. Loved the recent fight thought"
The Deep,Which other character can you write a threesome with an octopus for?
The Deep,Hes their favourite punching bag. Ofcourse they love him
The Deep,"Amazing acting, just keeping a straight face through this shit. Helps that he's cute as a button as well. 
I kinda keep hoping for Redemption for him, and for some good things to happen for him, but he's just too stupid to not fuck up the opportunities."
The Deep,Wish they could've played favorites with Lamplighter for a little while longer :((
The Deep,He was funny at first but after 2 seasons of the same shtick they need to do something different than haha he fucks fish
The Deep,Best character
The Deep,I dunno. I feel like they spend too much time on him when that screen time could go to their characters that are more exciting.
Good Witch,"It’s because all of those things were already (somewhat well-known) idiomatic phrases in English. 

Even a quick google search shows me plenty of examples for each. “The good doctor” is sometimes used ironically, sometimes not, and has been for many years; “the good wife” had different origins but seems in the mid-20th century to have come to refer to the sort of model American wife; “good cop” is more common as it is used in the phrase “good cop/bad cop” so it isn’t quite as big of a stretch; “good place” is the similar to “good cop” because it’s used in juxtaposition with “the bad place,” which is mostly used as a way to avoid saying “hell” for people who think that’s a swear word, and it’s just extrapolated from that; “the good witch” has probably been around for a while but was popularized by *The Wizard of Oz* and Glinda, the Good Witch. This probably doesn’t cover *all* the shows named like this, and I definitely think there’s some synchronicity to the whole thing, but it isn’t necessarily just lazy writing/naming.

TL;DR: these examples in particular are just existing English phrases (or parts of common phrases)."
Good Witch,"The Good Place...

Good is the new American. Everything used to start with American."
Good Witch,The Good Universe is one of the more underrated cinematic universes.
Good Witch,"I remember during the 2010’s that every movie begin with Bad …

Bad Santa
Bad Cops
Bad Teacher
Bad Neighbours
Bad Grandpa"
Good Witch,"In the case of *The Good Wife* and *The Good Fight* specifically, it's because the shows are a series."
Good Witch,"The reason for this is that there are a lot of common phrases which start with ""The Good/Good"". Let's go through your list: 

The Good Doctor, a very common olde timey way of greeting a doctor, ""Ah look, here comes the good doctor now.""

The Good Cop, good cop bad cop interrogation tactics, a very common trope.

The Good Witch, a reference to Wizard of Oz.

The Good Place, a common term used to refer to heaven.

The only one I can't think of a phrase for is Good Wife, but that is probably created by self-referencing the ""Good"" trope."
Good Witch,"Better standard of show beginning “Black…”

Black Monday, Black Mirror, Black Books, Blackadder, Black Sails, Black Bird

Orange is definitely NOT the new Black."
Good Witch,[deleted]
Good Witch,Bandwagon. Once someone does something that works it's milked to death.
Good Witch,"New trend: names of shows just being the year. 1899, 1923,"
Good Witch,"Because the Bad Doctor, the Bad Cop, the Bad Wife, just sound like real life."
Good Witch,"And why do we need to see the ""Rise of"" so many things?"
Good Witch,"It's a common linguistic structure. 

In the case of these shows, there seems to be an element of irony or dramatic tension to it. They're either not about ""good"" people (good wife, good cop) or about a type that isn't typically good (good witch)."
Good Witch,TIL there’s a show called The Good Witch.
Good Witch,"TV/Hollywood have a bad time in general at naming their shows.

I mean as soon as i saw Avatar: The Way of Water i rolled my eyes."
Good Witch,[deleted]
Good Witch,Show runners aren't that clever with titles?
Good Witch,"not sure, but probably because it's a word anyone knows the world over and so it is immediately recognisable, not necessarly indicating that the x character is good per se though

talking about The Good Wife, man, ain't Julianna Margulies one of the most beautiful women on the planet? Her face is literally perfect, that smile can melt concrete"
Good Witch,"Right up there with show names that end in ""ish."""
Good Witch,I don’t know but The Good Cop underrated for real… not just cause I was on it
Good Witch,Good is good which people like
Good Witch,"Nothing except what the show is trying to put forth. Not any different than putting the word new, bad, etc in front of something."
Good Witch,"The Good American is certainly coming. /s

For American, wasn't it mostly the American Crime/Horror Story saga mostly."
Good Witch,This is the best one though
Good Witch,The dot is what broke me.
Good Witch,"the good wife was a reference to the ""good"" wives standing by their man at press conferences as they apologized for cheating on them."
Good Witch,"""Goodwife"" is also an old timey way to speak of a married woman. Sometimes shortened to ""Goody""."
Good Witch,Or The Girl...
Good Witch,better than colon origins.
Good Witch,"It's actually just ""Good Witch"" if you are talking about the tv show.

""The Good Witch"" refers to a series of Hallmark movies that the show is based on."
Good Witch,It's on Hallmark.
Good Witch,edit your comment please. you have no right to spoil.
Good Witch,"Pretty sure every show that ends with “-ish” is related (Black-ish, Mixed-ish & Grown-ish). Correct me if I’m wrong though"
Good Witch,"Isn't that just sort of a calling card-type thing to evoke shows from one particular creator? I can't think of anything that ends in ""ish"" which isn't from that person."
Good Witch,I loved the good cop

Good Witch,The Old Man...
Good Witch,"You are being downvoted but that person just spoiled arguably the biggest twist of The Good Place, I guess it's unlikely that anyone who reads it is likely to watch it"
Good Witch,Yeah they're all literally spin-offs...
Good Witch,Oh heck yeah nice! I’m Ryan lol
Good Witch,"The Americans. 

Also, after reading your list the world American seems weird."
Good Witch,[deleted]
Good Witch,American Sniper
Good Witch,The Farty Adventures…
Good Witch,"since instead of editing it they decided to downvote me, i m assuming its not a mistake but deliberate.

bad people everywhere there is nothing we can do about it. and yeah that moment was golden. the good place is really good series and i wouldnt want that spoiler for any of new audience."
Good Witch,Dude no freaking way! Ryan is absolutely hilarious
Good Witch,The World American (2023)
Good Witch,no i didn't. its between American Gods and American Crime Story
Good Witch,"First off, I don’t even think what they posted can be considered a spoiler. Second, even if it was, that doesn’t make them a bad person lmao. And third, the first season of TGP is almost five years old, I’d say that’s plenty of time for people to have watched it if they wanted to; the internet as a whole can’t be expected to tiptoe around spoilers forever"
Good Witch,Ah damn thank you! Andy Breckman really wrote a perfect character for me lol
Good Witch,"that kinda thinking ugh... no time limits for anything. and you can always talk spoiler free. or you can cover it. we re not getting your money for it. and yes if they cant see or dont wanna see how they can ruin someone elses joy for the series with some unnecessary information, they are bad people. and yes >!telling wife is not good might not be spoiler but telling good place is not a good place!< is major spoiler."
Good Witch,"I don’t know why but I love putting the Hallmark Christmas movies on in the background. Sure, they’re cliche as all hell, but they still have a certain charm to them, and they get me in the Christmas mood."
Good Witch,Omg good witch is so boring. Nothing ever happens and she has the same facial expression and emotion in every situation
Good Witch,I kinda want a Dinotopia reboot but I'm afraid Hallmark would changing it to fit with their Hallmark romance genre
Good Witch," We need more Aurora Teagarden mysteries, please."
Good Witch,"I wish they'd renew *When Hope Calls*, but it's not looking for a season #2 of that one at this point..."
Good Witch,My Aunts will be thrilled.
Good Witch,This Hallmark thing is so weird from the perspective of an Australian. I’ve heard it’s all trash but it also probably has higher budgets than anything we on tv over here.
Good Witch,Not more sappy holiday movies!
Good Witch,"I so desperately want to like them, but I just can’t stomach the formulaic storylines."
Good Witch,I watch it when I’m super stressed. I never realized her fave doesn’t change... damn...
Good Witch,I wish *Hallmark* meant now what it meant in the early 2000's.
Good Witch,"Trash...no. Just all basically the same, romance, romance, trouble, more romance-even with the Christmas movies. Higher budget? definitely not. They cost less, so they can make a lot of them. Not cheaply made, but easily made."
Good Witch,"Hey, again that’s why I find them charming in a way. All so predictable. But I most likely don’t throw them on for the story, again moreso to get that Christmas mood going."
Good Witch,At this point Hallmark should sell the rights to it a lot of companies and people were interested in doing Dinotopia projects before Hallmark got the rights like Disney (their Dinotopia project ended up becoming the movie Dinosaur) and George Lucas (it's rumoured that he used some of the concepts for his cancelled Dinotopia project for the architecture of Naboo in the Star Wars prequels)
Good Witch,This show is good for washing your brain off after watching too many violent and/or disturbing shows.
Good Witch,"I've never watched this, but the commercials I see during Frasier reruns seem so sweet and *wholesome*."
Good Witch,Yay! 
Good Witch,This show is so happy!
Good Witch,"I liked most of the movies, but season 1 of the series was dull as dishwater.I

They should have just recast Chris Potter and started from there."
Good Witch,"Whoot! Whoot! This show is honestly heartwarming. Sam is a bad ass moving into town, taming his son and neighbor while saving lives. He does it all honestly. "
Good Witch,Hooray!
Good Witch,Sounds like the kind of show my Mee Maw would love if she were still here with us.
Good Witch,"**YES!**

I'm one of the non-demographics that genuinely enjoy this show. It's nothing riveting, but it's exactly the lighthearted, fun and stress-reducing show I need"
Good Witch,"Great news. I Love it. I know, it's not a series that most Reddit-readers really would watch but hey!"
Good Witch,Tried to watch this show because Catherine Bell was in it.  Couldn't get past the first 20 minutes.  I am definitely not in the target audience.
Good Witch,"RIP Mee Maw. What a beautiful, wonderful soul she was. </3"
Good Witch,"Maybe if 3 from Dark Matter were sent back in time to Earth of old after messing with some technology he didn't understand, it would make for an interesting crossover. "
Good Witch,"I can't believe how adequate dark matter is.  That doesn't sound like a compliment but it is.  Rarely are scifi shows on syfy hit that perfect area between low-budget and adequate without trying too hard.  Dark Matter is just so perfect at giving the audience exactly what they want in a mediocrely adequate syfy show.

oh, and killjoy need to be mercy kill before it ruined anymore lives."
Good Witch,"True...also the joke was kinda that Anthony Lemke (plays 3) used to be on The Good Witch (I get bored and will try anything on Netflix sometimes). And of course Dark Matter did just do a time travel episode to a small wintery town (was Wisconsin though, I think The Good Witch is set in New Hampshire). "
Good Witch,grimdark Wizard of Oz? but why?
Good Witch,You know what the original Wizard of Oz lacked?  Sexual tension between Dorothy and the Scarecrow.   Thanks NBC!
Good Witch,"I'm getting some serious *The Shannara Chronicles* vibes from this, and that's not a compliment."
Good Witch,"Oh, for some reason I thought this was the tv series they made out of Wicked. But really, how many times do they have to remake Wizard of Oz?"
Good Witch,Oh for god sake please no..
Good Witch,"Why not? We've seen so many versions over the years, why not make something mostly new, just wrapped around the bones of the original idea? 

It doesn't look any darker than GOT, and I don't hear anyone whining about how ""grimdark"" that show is. It seems to be a term used as a pejorative only for media people don't like.

And no, I'm not making a judgment about how good or bad it will be, maybe it will end up being shit, I'm just saying that I don't have a problem with them twisting the original story up.

Do we really need to see the bashful white chick and her dog and the cowardly lion and the tin man and the idiot scarecrow fight the evil witch and her stupid flying monkeys again?"
Good Witch,I was getting that too. This looks way too good for NBC. At first I thought this would be on on Syfy.
Good Witch,"1) You're completely neglecting the fact that the source material for GoT is grimdark, whereas WoO is considered a fun, family friendly classic.   
2) Yes, we do need to see all of those characters, because that's what the story is about! Wicked gets a pass because it builds upon the core concepts and characters that people love about the original. This new show isn't an adaptation or homage. It's a lazy attempt to capitalize on an existing public domain franchise while stripping away every single aspect that fans of that franchise know and love. "
Good Witch,"Just discovered this series, so good news I thing. I'm going to start soon with the 7 films that started the series."
Good Witch,Catherine Bell MMMMMMMMMM!
Good Witch,"What's the show like? 

I'd love to add something nice and lighthearted to my watching list, but I'm not sure what to expect from Hallmark."
Good Witch,I just started watching this show. Its cheesy but I love it. I need some light hearted feel good escapisms.
Good Witch,I need this so much sooner. Cannot handle the season two finale.
Good Witch,what's it like? 
Good Witch,Nice and lighthearted is what Hallmark does.  
Good Witch,"Well I only watched the first episode so far and that was quite good. It's a light-hearted series. It's basically a dramady with a fantasy twist.

The storyline picks up where the movies started but I got the feeling that you don't have to watch the movies first to get the story lines because the series stars with a introduction of a new character to the town. But I decided to watch the films before going on with it anyway."
Good Witch,"Never even knew about the movies, my partner just started watching season 1 and before I knew it I was hooked demanding we stay up and keep watching."
Good Witch,HBO: Carnivale. It just stopped with no conclusion at all!
Good Witch,GLOW
Good Witch,The Expanse
Bad Education,And a new Detectorists special 🤯
Bad Education,"I've never really liked him on panel shows but in TV and film he just plays himself turned up to 11 and I absolutely adore his characters. 

Tastes are strange but will tune in."
Bad Education,[deleted]
Bad Education,It's a brilliant comedy. I can't wait to watch this but how will they top the movie?
Bad Education,Was subjected to one of his Netflix standup specials at the behest of my girlfriend's mom and he was just fucking awful. An absolute hack completely reeking of douchiness.
Bad Education,I love this guy
Bad Education,Fuck this posh prick
Bad Education,Love it!!! Thought this show was so funny!
Bad Education,This dude sucks.
Bad Education,[deleted]
Bad Education,"I love Jack Whitehall, and I have never heard of this show"
Bad Education,HOW IS THAT NOT THE HEADLINE
Bad Education,Whaaaaaaa? This is the real news .
Bad Education,That is fantastic news! A beautiful show
Bad Education,YES!
Bad Education,Yeah I've never been a fan but I did quite like Bad Education.
Bad Education,"His stand up is awful, has always made me avoid his acting. Should probably check out Bad Education."
Bad Education,He was a surprise act at the Comedy Store when I went a few years back and I thought he was fab.
Bad Education,I'm guessing it was the same one I watched where he apparently decided to top Aziz Ansari in namedropping.
Bad Education,A lot of British humour doesn't travel well across the Atlantic.
Bad Education,Love him!
Bad Education,Why? Just.....why?
Bad Education,"This guy is the exact kind of person Bob Hoskins was complaining about decades ago with the influx of the rich into the UK entertainment industry. Rich kids like Whitehall literally walk into television and movie careers without hardly trying, leaving very little work left for any working class people to aspire to get. 

People like Bob Hoskins and Richard Burton came from hard working class backgrounds and there was an industry for their talent to be borne into. The working class have close to zero hope of ever getting a break into the industry these days."
Bad Education,... and his dad
Bad Education,He’d probably agree.
Bad Education,Lmfao
Bad Education,Love him!
Bad Education,"Not sure why you were downvoted into negatives, his dad's had a career in TV production for years and got Jack on TV through his connections.

This is pretty well known, or so I thought."
Bad Education,"He played a teacher.

It's typical Jack Whitehall comedy, too, as in ""not funny at all"". He's like a posh version of James Corden."
Bad Education,"I've only seen two and the first was fine but the 2nd most recent one on Netflix, I couldn't even get past 20 minutes. He doesn't have good execution of his ""jokes"" and punchlines and plays up his ""high class pansy"" stereotype shtick too often. Though I liked Fresh Meat but thankfully it wasn't focused just on him, and Bad Education was pretty good, but I haven't enjoyed his films (or at least his parts in them) though"
Bad Education,Nah he’s just not a very good comedian. Plenty of Brits do just fine.
Bad Education,"I’m British (English).

I’d argue Jack doesn’t travel well across these counties

Jacks been on the scene for a long time now and I wish him absolutely no ill will.

Having said that, I know one person who likes his stand up/father and son shows

He seems nice. Quick wit and good on a chat show….but I ain’t seeking him out.

I’d argue he probably does well overseas as he fits that stereotypical British mould. The inoffensive toff."
Bad Education,"lol nah, the issue isn't that I didn't ""get it"" but that it was pure hackery. I'm a longtime fan of Mitchell of Webb. I love British humor."
Bad Education,[Hmmm](https://i.imgur.com/X48RsLd.jpg)
Bad Education,You’re learning our American ways
Bad Education,He agrees with you. Watch his whole rant about Robert Pattinson. They were in the same class.
Bad Education,"Idk man it sucks for the lower class people who want to be actors but he didn't choose to be born well off. He was good in Fresh Meat playing himself essentially. And I like Bad Education as well. I'm from the US so I know nothing about the UK industry but there's a shitload of nepotism here.

I'm not really sure why coming from a working class family should qualify you more for an acting role but it sounds like an industry issue."
Bad Education,Found Jack's account.
Bad Education,I don't think you know what nepotism is.
Bad Education,I’ve never seen that show but one example doesn’t disprove my point. There are endless examples of British comedy which enjoyed no success across the Atlantic
Bad Education,I recognize most of these people but can you give context for the photo and how it relates to the discussion? Genuinely curious since as an American I'm fairly new to a lot of British entertainers and don't know many of their personal stories.
Bad Education,At least Pattinson isn't an annoying cunt
Bad Education,"Posh people have more opportunities to develop their acting skills because their boarding schools provide extensive extra curricular activities well beyond what any state school can offer. Consequently, they are years ahead of people their age from less elite backgrounds."
Bad Education,[deleted]
Bad Education,"> there's a shitload of nepotism here

Same here.

Jack's dad worked in the TV industry for decades and used his connections to get Jack on TV. He's a posh James Corden in how insufferable and unfunny he is."
Bad Education,I wish!
Bad Education,"This is a dumb argument. I got his punchlines just fine, he isn't writing some strictly regional humor. He is a hack, pure and simple."
Bad Education,"I believe the point was to illustrate they, like Jack Whitehall, all came from pretty wealthy families and entered the UK entertainment industry, every single one achieving great success. This photo is them at University of Cambridge, one of the more posh Universities in the UK."
Bad Education,"Nearly every British star went to an expensive public school were you need excellent connections and a healthy bank balance to attend. Jack went to school with people like Emma Watson, Robert Pattinson, the Duchess of Cambridge and Princess Eugenie. 

Britain used to get working class children into the higher spheres of society through selective schools (called grammar schools) but they were closed down due to being perceived as too middle class and elitist. Since they were closed down, Britain has become increasingly dominated in every sphere by people who attended a small number of elite schools. 

People like to pick on Jack because he doesn't disguise his privileged upbringing. Pick a British Hollywood star and there is a very high chance they enjoyed the same privilege as Jack."
Bad Education,Jesus Christ you people hate everything lmao.
Bad Education,Ummmmm
Bad Education,How's that Jack's fault?
Bad Education,"Yeah. It sucks for the poor people but the kids didn't choose to be privileged. They were afforded the luxury of honing their talent which gave them a head start. It's a never ending cycle but I don't think it's fair for people to say ""Hey you've been acting for years but you don't deserve this role. Give it to someone whose parents make less money than your's"" 

I guess low income scholarships might help but regardless of your ability and resume, connections will still be a thing that are impossible to get rid of."
Bad Education,"Yeah. I get that but unfortunately it's in every industry. Not just nepotism but race, gender, height, attractiveness. The list goes on and on. I guess for this sort of thing it falls on the studios to step up. At the end of the day I hope the person is at least qualified for the position.

Btw I've only seen her in Fresh but I liked her. I wanted them to show the butt."
Bad Education,"I have noticed that quite a lot of the people I watch on panel shows or various comedies did go to Cambridge or other associated schools.

Just for clarification, who is in this photo? Pretty sure I see John Oliver, Richard Ayoade, and David Mitchell. The second from the left looks familiar but I can't recall who it is."
Bad Education,"Grammar schools are still a thing in the UK. My town has 2 of them, in fact I went to one of them and I'm from a working class background."
Bad Education,"Not everything, mainly just Whitehall"
Bad Education,"Even the scholarships tend to go to the impoverished higher classes; Boris Johnson received one which enabled him to attend Eton. 

I agree that it wouldn’t be fair to stop people getting roles based on their background. Bringing back grammar schools would massively help narrow the gap between the elite and the rest."
Bad Education,[deleted]
Bad Education,If Jack fucking Whitehall is an annoying cunt then that says more about you bro
Bad Education,"Thank you, that's definitely where I recognize him from."
Bad Education,Cory Finley is the real deal. Loved Thoroughbreds.
Bad Education,Rian Johnson + Cory Finley = take all my money
Bad Education,Ooh hey now
Bad Education,His best performance will always be The Fountain.
Bad Education,incorrect. Hugh Jackman's greatest performance was as himself in whichever Night at the Museum sequel that was.
Bad Education,"Haven't seen Bad Education, but really his best performances for me so far have been The Prestige and of course Logan."
Bad Education,I just feel like the title is not helping the project out when I see bad education I just think of bad movies like bad teacher
Bad Education,Why did they name it the same as Jack Whitehall’s british comedy show?? I honestly thought he was in that from this title 😂
Bad Education,"His best performance to me was prisoners, by a mile."
Bad Education,"HBO has a terrible track record with the movies it acquires. The OG and Native Son were buried by them, among others. heres hoping this one gets more recognition."
Bad Education,"Can’t wait to see it, still wish it was getting a proper release because based on a bunch of reviews jackman is amazing in it and probably would’ve been an Oscar contender"
Bad Education,That’s looks great
Bad Education,very excited to see Cory Finley's career progress
Bad Education,I don’t care what anyone says- he gave 100% and a solid performance in [his scene in Movie 43](https://youtu.be/pj2eQZ3NrCY).
Bad Education,And/or prisoners.
Bad Education,Such an underrated film. And the *score*.
Bad Education,I prefered Ponce de Leon
Bad Education,He's great in Prisoners too.
Bad Education,He was amazing in Les Miserables. He looked ravaged. I saw it again last week and the man made me bawl like a baby.
Bad Education,"He acted well in Logan, it was just such a boring and dumb movie his acting was overshadowed."
Bad Education,Or the show Bad Education.
Bad Education,Allison Janney too! Watched it last night and the cast was wonderful.
Bad Education,"Holy shit I forgot about that movie, I feel like this was the only part I laughed during that whole movie"
Bad Education,What in the hell is the context here
Bad Education,Ball Chin!
Bad Education,The Score is a good movie too
Bad Education,Oh man.... can't believe i forgot that one. Yeah he was great in that.
Bad Education,"His acting was very good in Les Mis, but his vocal performance really took it over the top. Jackman is a wonderful singer."
Bad Education,"There really isn’t any. Movie 43 is a series of short, disconnected scenes played by very famous actors who all seriously regretted it. If I remember correctly, they’re stories being “pitched” by someone holding a producer hostage."
Bad Education,"This show totally  changed my opinion of jack Whitehall, never really liked his standup . The headteacher is one of my favourite characters of the show "
Bad Education,fuck such an underrated show
Bad Education,"I wasn't really into it until the scene with the head teacher finding graffiti about herself in the bathroom, being disgusted with it and then correcting the grammar 

Edit: Wow someone is a bit of a jerk here aren't they, downvoting everything."
Bad Education,Yeah it's great. This and Fresh Meat.
Bad Education,"I'm actually agreeing with you here, I never liked his standup much or his appearences on panel shows, but I genuinely really love his charcters in this one and Fresh Meat."
Bad Education,"Did not expect it from a comedy, feel completely emotionally drained "
Bad Education,"I really enjoyed this show. I wish a lot more people knew about it. 

Any chance anybody knows the song that played at the very start of the episode? Better yet, if someone has a soundtrack for the whole show, I'd be interested in that. This show had really great music in it."
Bad Education,"I have yet to finish season 3 but it's not a series finale is it? I really enjoy it, I know it's meant to get a US remake with the same actor but it would get totally butchered, way too politically incorrect for us tv. "
Bad Education,It was the final series.
Bad Education,I am pretty sure that Death Note does not have 11 seasons
72 Dangerous Places,To be honest it looks to me like it's going to be one of those examples of shows that is going to repeat itself every time you come back from a commercial break and really drag out the handful of content you have to show. Having said that I will give it a go. Best of luck to you.

72 Dangerous Places,I can actually say that its not. Every episode pumps through the infomation and its actually interesting. 
72 Dangerous Places,Haha you'll have to watch and find out
72 Dangerous Places,Kinda being the key word here
72 Dangerous Places,"Oh awesome thanks mate! It will air in the US, it will be on Nat Geo in early August. As I have more airing details I'll flick you a message!"

Its on Nat Geo Wild every Tuesday night at 7:30pm 
Sorry for the late reply just remembered about this."

I would watch something like this.

Slightly off-topic but this reminds me *exactly* of a comedy-action-medical-drama series a friend of mine pitched called *Undercover Doctors*. Almost to a tee.

Each episode the Doctors would have to go deep into hostile territory and perform life-saving/enhancing operations. Episodes include performing a heart-transplant to a prisoner of a Colombian guerrilla group, blood transplant for a mole in a heavily fortified breakaway Christian Science militia etc. Breaks down like 10% drama, 40% action and 50% comedy."

I'm not familiar with most of these, and I watch a shit-ton of TV and movies. I really like the effort, and the writeups are perfect in length.


Again, not knowing these a lot, is Severance the highest ranked English speaking show? (Nothing against non English speakers of course) 


Also, I'm guessing most of these are straight drama? Language and genre might both be useful things to put in parenthesis for anyone else unfamiliar.


Totally agree with the couple from White Lotus being great characters, I much preferred season 1 (which seems like a hot take) but those two, specifically the woman, were very interesting characters to me."

..................

I didn't like what 2022 television had to offer for the most part. One too many disappointments for me as well. I mean I watched a lot more shows than I did in 2021, yet struggled to find 25 new shows for this list. But I do think my top 13 here are genuinely great.But anyways, thanks a lot for reading, even if you just scrolled through this lol. Same time, same place, next year? ❤️"
72 Dangerous Places,"Neat list.  A lot of shows I've not seen.

A few shows from 2022 I'd recommend if you haven't seen em:

- Black Bird

- SAS Rogue Heroes

- The Offer

- Under the Banner of Heaven"
72 Dangerous Places,Recency bias but I just finished Yellowjackets and really had a great time watching it.
72 Dangerous Places,No Atlanta? Both seasons last year were incredible
72 Dangerous Places,Pachinko is the most slept on series of 2022
72 Dangerous Places,"1. She hulk
2. Ted lasso
3. Ms Marvel
4. Harley Quinn show
5. Lord of the rings
6. Spy x family 
7. Chainsaw man
8. Loki
9. Mob psycho
10. Hot D"
72 Dangerous Places,Which ones did you see? 🤔 amma take a wild guess and say The Bear and Severance?
72 Dangerous Places,"> is Severance the highest ranked English speaking show?

Yes. Even though Pachinko got a bit of english too. 

> I'm guessing most of these are straight drama? Language and genre might both be useful things to put in parenthesis for anyone else unfamiliar.

Yea. And yea I should probably do that next time."
72 Dangerous Places,"i just read the synopsis and glance at the preview a bit sometimes just to check visual/production quality. if it looks like something that could be potentially great, i check it out."
72 Dangerous Places,🙂💕
72 Dangerous Places,It’s great but it’s depressing.
72 Dangerous Places,"What other new anime from 2022 did you think were great? 

Anime for me in 2022 was, *meh* tbh. I didn't like Summertime Rendering much and Chainsaw Man hasn't gotten to the good parts of the manga yet. I was suppose to see Bocchi The Rock! before making this list, but ended up getting an ear infection so couldn't."
72 Dangerous Places,I'd count Yellowjackets as 2021 TV show.
72 Dangerous Places,on the other version of this list pinned on my profile.
72 Dangerous Places,"Nice! Do you often give the pilot a go before fully committed to the whole season? Any shows that you have given up midpoint? 


Like I tried to start Warrior Nun because the trailer seems fun and the lead actress looks very beautiful, also being afraid of it being cancelled (it indeed got cancelled then), but have given up after episode 6 or 7… cause the plot is very weak and the characters are laughable.


And then I tried to pick the ones that got high ratings in imdb, and started watching Extraordinary Attorney Woo and I do like it so far! Although sometimes being too cheesy at times, the acting is excellent and the stories are well-written. Highly recommended."
72 Dangerous Places,"Dropped Summertime after 5 minutes lol.

But personally, Bocchi the Rock is incredible TV and is my #1 show of any medium this year. And I'm not even usually into anime comedies. It's just that good, glad you're gonna try it! I'm an Attack on Titan fan after the massive story shift in Season 3, and S4P2 aired at the start of the year, although personally I don't like rating something that isn't an entire season.

Otherwise Chainsaw Man would be a decent pick even if, as you said, it hasn't quite gotten to what makes it special yet. Cyberpunk Edgerunners is one that would be worth watching and has near universal praise, and my other 2 shows to hit a 9 were Kaguya S3 (but it's not everyone), and Paripi Koumei, which I thought was an extremely passionate show but it might hit as a 7-8 for others. 

From your list I probably have to watch the 2 seasons of Tatami though. I had no idea it was well regarded I never looked into it!

Other than that though, yea there was a lot of meh. Spy Family went from potentially great to just average as it went on, LycoRyco got a lot of hype but was merely good not great (needed some writing cleanup). Personally though Dress up Darling was ok at best, and Gundam and To Your Eternity were massive disappointments"
72 Dangerous Places,Ignoring some great sequels I thought Chainsaw man was awesome even if it hadn't gotten to some of the good parts  of the manga. And I really liked summertime rendering (although I haven't seen the last few episodes). Lycoris recoil was fun. Spy X Family was great.
72 Dangerous Places,Oh my bad. I’m late to the party.
72 Dangerous Places,"> Do you often give the pilot a go before fully committed to the whole season?

I give everything at least 4 episodes before I decided whether it's working for me or not. Unless it's *reeeeeeeaaaaally* bad... then I quit after the 2nd or 3rd. But that rarely happens. That has only happened like 4 times in the past 3 years. 

> Any shows that you have given up midpoint?

A shit ton. 

> Extraordinary Attorney

I was suppose to watch this show too but unfortunately didn't have time for it. There are some great shows coming out of korea nowadays (3 are on this list too lol), but they require commitment with those lengthy episode counts and runtime. 

I recommend ""**D.P.**"" on netflix too if you haven't seen it. That's another outstanding one."
72 Dangerous Places,"> Bocchi the Rock is incredible TV and is my #1 show of any medium this year. And I'm not even usually into anime comedies. It's just that good

damn. guess i gotta hurry and check this one out now. lol."
72 Dangerous Places,"You should check out Kotaro Lives Alone, such a good show!"
72 Dangerous Places,"Heard good reviews about DP but I haven’t managed to watch it, with season 2 coming this year I may watch it soon!

For other Korean shows I watched My Name, Hellbound and of course Squid Game in 2021, which were all very good. Narco-Saints, The Glory and Somebody are shows I saved in 2022 but not started yet."
72 Dangerous Places,I did hear about it! I'll add it to my list thanks!
72 Dangerous Places,"Post more threads like this for sure. Always fun to read about some of the lesser known and hyped shows that are due in 2023. I was aware of some of these shows but I had no idea stuff like Mrs Davis and The Consultant were in the works. 

You do a decent job of selling all the shows on that list and that is often more than can be said for the distributors themselves!"
72 Dangerous Places,"This is really cool, I've seen some of these where the ""why you should be excited"" section didn't do much but you made me genuinely excited to watch a lot of these, thank you!"
72 Dangerous Places,The Curse is going to be fucking bonkers but it's going to be on Showtime so I won't ever see it
72 Dangerous Places,Warrior season 3 HBO Max
72 Dangerous Places,"There's a non-zero chance that Brit Marling's show is actually season 3 of The OA in disguise, knowing how creative she is."
72 Dangerous Places,"Fantastic write up, love the format. Already knew about many of these, but the 'Why should I be excited?' would for sure sell me on these shows otherwise. Specially the mention of showrunners, writers, and directors and previous shows, since is really common for people to look for new shows based on previous ones they've liked.

I personally I'm most excited for **The Fall of the House of Usher**, as a Flanagan superfan that recently watched **Midnight Mass** and loved every second of it and **Retreat**, ever since **The OA** cancellation my heart longs for more Brit and Zal storytelling.

I'll add **The Consultant**, **Mrs. Davis** and **The Curse** to my list, all seem like great projects."
72 Dangerous Places,Interesting that there's no mention on IMDB or the show's poster that Shogun is an adaptation of an incredibly popular book by James Clavell. You would think they'd want to let people know to draw in that audience
72 Dangerous Places,Woah the guy who made counterpart is making a shogun adaption?? Holy fuck I am extremely excited for that. Counterpart is one of the coolest shows I’ve ever seen and definitely the most unique spy thriller show.
72 Dangerous Places,Well now im interested in Time bandits
72 Dangerous Places,Nice to see a list that isn't just posting all the blockbuster shows
72 Dangerous Places,The ending to the time bandits movie was so messed up it still bothers me to this day ever time I think about it.
72 Dangerous Places,Most interesting is mrs davis
72 Dangerous Places,Really looking forward to the Apple + shows.  Mrs American Pie and Time Bandits.
72 Dangerous Places,"I started watching Willow and was thinking how cool it would be to have a Time Bandits TV series, so happy to see it on the list. The rest of the shows don't really interest me much at this stage, going by the descriptions. Could be some gems in there but nothing I can see right now.

Thanks for posting though."
72 Dangerous Places,"Not excited by any of those, but thanks for the post.

Hopefully something piques my interest in the next one.

I have almost nothing to watch at the moment and struggling to find new stuff."
72 Dangerous Places,"Or I can not access the streaming service or I dont have that service or Is not interesting enough. Or all reasons to once in the mayority of times.

But your work is interesting."
72 Dangerous Places,Looking forward to Shogun. Anything with Samurai Warriors & Japanese Culture intrigue me.
72 Dangerous Places,"Echo (Disney+) 

Agatha: Coven of Chaos (Disney+)"
72 Dangerous Places,"> Shōgun, set in feudal Japan, charts the collision of two ambitious men from different worlds and a mysterious female samurai.

That... Is not the plot of ""Shogun"""
72 Dangerous Places,None of these sound interesting.
72 Dangerous Places,How about some foreign shows?
72 Dangerous Places,"Great, more of the same shitty shows for white, middle-aged, alcoholic moms."
72 Dangerous Places,Only the curse sounds great on paper
72 Dangerous Places,"They pretty much all sound good, but really excited for retreat, shogun and the curse because of whose attached"
72 Dangerous Places,I try to keep on top of new stuff but there's a couple of things I'd not heard of that I'll likely read more about/check out
72 Dangerous Places,Only one I knew about was House of Usher. I'll definitely check out the shows from ''Servant'' and ''The OA''s creators as well as the one from Lindelof.
72 Dangerous Places,Honestly I had never heard about any of these shows before reading this. Definitely looking forward to a few of them.
72 Dangerous Places,"If Damon Lindelof hadn't already sold me on Mrs Davis, ""Betty Gilpin as a nun battling artificial intelligence"" definitely did"
72 Dangerous Places,Agreed. Excellent thread and now I have shows to be excited for. I’m pumped.
72 Dangerous Places,"To be fair, most of those shows just haven't started their marketing campaign. The important thing for the distributors is that people know about it when it releases."
72 Dangerous Places,"Same. As someone who loves House Hunters International *and* Emma Stone, I feel like this show was basically made for me but I have no clue if Showtime is even a thing here? And if not, where can I watch it?"
72 Dangerous Places,It's really not that hard to watch a show on a channel you don't have c'mon.
72 Dangerous Places,Paramount+ and Amazon Prime have deals on Showtime frequently. If you have Prime go sign up for their 1.99 a month Black Friday deal and watch Yellowjackets. At least if you're in the USA.
72 Dangerous Places,"Please God, I'd do anything for this"
72 Dangerous Places,we can only hope.
72 Dangerous Places,It was evil.
72 Dangerous Places,Shogun doesn't interest you?
72 Dangerous Places,What do you like?
72 Dangerous Places,Read the book. It is a masterpiece.
72 Dangerous Places,I'm pretty sure at least 2 of the 10 are foreign.
72 Dangerous Places,"There was one on the list, but I’d love to see more options too. There are some great shows out there we  Americans miss out on until someone like AMC+ or EPIC+ buys the rights. *This is Going To Hurt* was my favorite show this year and no one saw it."
72 Dangerous Places,You need to get out and experience the world more.
72 Dangerous Places,"Indeed. I read through the list and perhaps *Time Bandits* might work, assuming Jemaine can successfully reign in Taika still.

Also I don’t like the Horror genre but Mike Flanagan can probably pull off a big win."
72 Dangerous Places,"Yeah, only one of those seemed even remotely interesting"
Aquarius,"NBC's like, ""no one watches live anyways so why even sell ads?""
"
Aquarius,"You report ""will air as unprecedented commercial free broadcast"" but what I read is ""we couldn't sell ad time on a show whose first season we burnt off on Saturdays last summer, so might as well spin it in a positive way""."
Aquarius,24 already did this.
Aquarius,"you know, this is one of my favorite shows to come out of last year (on the networks anyway.) It's not perfect but it's really addictive and a good spin on a cop show, a genre I don't usually like. I'm happy they're giving it a real second chance."
Aquarius,I thought this was cancelled.
Aquarius,"Damn, that's actually kinda impressive a broadcast network would do that"
Aquarius,"I didn't know this show was still going. I liked the first couple of episodes, but kind of fell of it.  I'll probably wind up binge watching this series at some point."
Aquarius,Duchovny is great in this. I guess he's always great. 
Aquarius,I predict a lot of product placement. 
Aquarius,This is hardly unprecedented.
Aquarius,Isn't this the show whose entire first season they put online at once and then somehow never got an audience week to week on TV?
Aquarius,Anyone born after 1970 just yawned and opened up their Netflix or Kodi windows where they've been watching commercial free television for years now.
Aquarius,NBC's Aquarius got a second season? Is he fighting Manson again?
Aquarius,NBC proably couldn't even sell ads so there spinning it.
Aquarius,Unprecedented! The start of a new era of television! You might say that this is the dawning of the age of...
Aquarius,That's nearly three episodes of content. Great way to get some buzz for a show that will probably pull worse ratings than the CW and burn off nearly a quarter of the series (assuming it's 12-13 episodes). 
Aquarius,Now if AMC could run even half the commercials for The Walking Dead. They would never do this commercial free thing though. Never. 
Aquarius,"And TV is still dead. 

> I didn't kill it. Don't blame me. It was dead when I got here. It's too late for prayers. For even if the prayers were answered, and a miracle occurred, and the yen did this, and the dollar did that, and the infrastructure did the other thing, we would still be dead. You know why? Fiber optics. New technologies. Obsolescence. We're dead alright. We're just not broke. And you know the surest way to go broke? Keep getting an increasing share of a shrinking market. Down the tubes. Slow but sure. You know, at one time there must've been dozens of companies making buggy whips. And I'll bet the last company around was the one that made the best goddamn buggy whip you ever saw."
Aquarius,"I misread it as two-hour commercial, and thought: why make it longer than it already is?"
Aquarius,"Well done, NBC. This is appreciated. Now could you also run your reality shows and SNL with only the commercials? Thank you."
Aquarius,Maybe the only good decision made by NBC in the past five years.
Aquarius,"This is what the BBC is like, all the time."
Aquarius,"However, 24 had long-form commercials before and after their premiere. Will Aquarius do the same, or is it a full two hours without commercials?"
Aquarius,"Like a bunch of times.  I think they opened three seasons like this.  It was a big joke too because even though it didn't have ads, the cars had giant chevy logos on their backs and other very obvious in your face product placement."
Aquarius,I dug it.
Aquarius,"No, they cancelled *Hannibal* to renew this"
Aquarius,"It certainly is something different. I stopped watching during last season, but I fear the show is just not entertaining enough for a full two hour episode. "
Aquarius,Of all the things here i'll never understand why TWD and AMC is always so heavily singled out for commercials even though they are done exactly the same way that literally every other show and network does it. It makes absolutely no sense that so many people complain about this.
Aquarius,"NBC, moving on up from ""Nothing But Crap"" to ""Not Broadcasting Commercials."""
Aquarius,"Eh. Airing Community for 6 seasons, 30 Rock and Parks for 7, Hannibal for 3 when no one watched those shows. Moving Kimmy Schmidt to Netflix because they knew it would suffer the same fate, same with selling Brooklyn 99 and Mindy Project to other networks. Bringing back live scripted TV, the Chicago franchise, making Fallon & Seth their late night guys...

People don't give NBC enough credit sometimes. They've probably handled the erosion of live TV viewing the best. It's ABC and Fox have already taken hard falls, CBS's will probably be hard as well."
Aquarius,Except when they brought Hannibal for three seasons. That'd be one amazing decision.
Aquarius,"But everyone who has BBC pays for it yearly in TV fees. It's like saying, why does NBC have ads when HBO doesn't? "
Aquarius,"Hannibal had a rating of like 0.00004. Get over it. This sub is so annoying with the ""Ugh they cancelled a show I like for a show I don't like""."
Aquarius,I think I'm going to be sick.
Aquarius,I know but I thought it was axed later.
Aquarius,"Agreed. Also watching The Walking Dead live sounds like paradise compared to what it was like watching Mad Men live every week. There were never any act breaks or even natural stopping points put in the show so AMC had to just take breaks wherever they felt like it, which made it feels choppy and disjointed. Also the classic AMC move is to run the start of an episode for 25 minutes without an ad break, and then to spend the rest of the episode airing 5 minutes of show and 3 minutes of ads."
Aquarius,"> i'll never understand why TWD and AMC is always so heavily singled out for commercials 



Idk either man,  these kids are idiots. "
Aquarius,Because a lot of people like to hate on TWD. Could also just feel longer to a lot of people for some reason in that show.
Aquarius,I only watch TWD lol. I don't even watch TV anymore. I'm canceling cable soon and just keeping internet. I watched the season finale and I swear it seemed like 3 minutes then commercial. It was so distracting from the story. I guess I'm just spoiled now from Netflix and the like with no interruptions. 
Aquarius,5 seasons of Community.
Aquarius,"Their soccer coverage is by far the best. Miles ahead of the likes of Bein, Fox, ESPN, etc."
Aquarius,I think people are still mad about Conan.
Aquarius,"i was with you until ""chicago franchise"" 

because preocedurals are garbage, especially when theres multiple spin offs of the same thing all going together. whats worse than 1 procedural? multiple based on the same universe"
Aquarius,It's really not comparable when you consider that is roughly 40p a day for a whole host of different channels and radio stations. Not even in the same league at all.
Aquarius,"Yea, but Hannibal still pulled in better ratings than Aquarius. Only like .1 better and Hannibal has got to be more expensive to make.  Also, no one is going to watch shit when you air the show on Friday and Saturday nights."
Aquarius,So hate on things *that are real*.  This bitching about commercials is fucking retarded. 
Aquarius,"> I only watch TWD lol. I don't even watch TV anymore.


That's stupid. "
Aquarius,Close enough.
Aquarius,Now this is a man who knows how to marry his cousin!
Aquarius,"I was for a long time, but I think even he's over it now, and Zucker's moved on to ruining CNN."
Aquarius,Whether you like it or not it doesn't change the fact that it was a good decision on their part. The shows are successful. Also it's ridiculous to write off procedurals simply for what they are. 
Aquarius,Well NBC is completely free. No payment necessary. They must rely on ads or else they wouldn't exist for very long. 
Aquarius,"Aquarius had a month where the entire show was online and that's why it was renewed. It did well there. 

This is also partially why it's so difficult to do the X-Files revival. "
Aquarius,"> but Hannibal still pulled in better ratings than Aquarius.


Doesn't matter,  because Hannibal was going into its fourth?  season, or would have been?  Its a more expensive show because of that. The people are famous, they want more money, contracts go up, this is how TV production works. This is why so few shows make it past season 2,  the contracts cost too much. 


Aquarius,  even at lower ratings,  makes more sense to do a season 2,  because its *cheap*.  The only big draw there is DD, and a cast of nobody pretty people. Plus,  they're drawing on public domain crime stories,  so easier writing there.  Its a summer show, so they can spend most of the budget on making everything ""look good"".


This is all standard, basic TV practices bud. 


>Also, no one is going to watch shit when you air the show on Friday and Saturday nights.


Which is why dying shows are moved there.  What aren't you getting about this?"
Aquarius,Why is it stupid? I'm tired of paying for something I don't use. Some people really are able to to survive without TV. I get news on the Internet from all over the world and read. The Walking Dead is the only current show I follow. 
Aquarius,"Again this is not comparable. You have basically gone full circle here. If they charged for the channel they wouldn't need adds, if they have add they don't need to charge for the channel, that is the crux of both your comments."
Aquarius,"Oof, that just triggered my frustrations on Chris Carter waiting 15 years to further mess up the mythology."
Aquarius,Exactly my point. You can't compare because BBC gets their funds through a different revenue stream that allows for the removal of ads. 
Aquarius,"> n Chris Carter waiting 15 years to further mess up the mythology.


I was the biggest fucking X-Files fan,  but I just hate this new season so much because of that.  I haven't even been able to finish it yet,  because I hate how they just threw away everything in the first two episodes or so. "
Aquarius,"And again as I said before, neither of these are comparable to how the BBC works either."
Aquarius,"Exactly as I said before, they cannot be compared because they have different means of thriving. You are reiterating exactly what I'm saying. I said they can't be compared, and you reply with  ""no, they aren't comparable."" 

Edit: btw, you were the first to try to draw comparison by saying the BBC is like that (commercial free) 24 hours, and I said they can't be compared. "
Aquarius,"No I wasn't, you did that. I was just mentioning that BBC had no ads, I didn't compare anything, you came along them and decided to draw comparisons. You did this when you brought price into it and compared channels.  Don't project buddy."
Aquarius,"This is the dawning of the

Aquarius,[deleted]
Aquarius,"*Hannibal* died to give this shit another season. Unbe-fucking-lievable.

The only consolation to NBC's stupidity is that Bryan Fuller can now give us ""American Gods"" and ""Star Trek: Discovery"""
Aquarius,Wasn't a fan got to slow 
Aquarius,[deleted]
Aquarius,"I guess you could say, it's *not* the age of Aquarius"
Aquarius,There seems to be a lot of hate for this show but I have both seasons and haven't watched an episode does it have a real ending? Is each season a separate story? 
Aquarius,"This show. I watched all episodes. When it first aired I thought it was an intriguing premise. Duchovny was good in it, he was incredibly watchable. It mentioned a lot of the stuff that was going on back then which I'm interested in. But the more I watched the second season and saw that they were getting wrong with Manson as a character and with how they staged the Tate murders I started to think about what it would have taken to do it right from a dramatic point of view and I came to the conclusion that it should never have been attempted at all.

Sharon Tate's sister was complaining about the show and I think she has a very fair point, which is that her sister got brutally murdered and that murder was presented as entertainment. 

Dramatically what was wrong with it was that the murders were kind of teased throughout the season and that lessened the tension that they should have had as fictional plot points. So the way it would have worked would have been for things to get increasingly abnormal from a slow start, giving more weight to the cases of the week and then increasingly seeing the family devolving into crazier and crazier behaviour ramping up the foreboding week by week and then showing the murders in a more or less real time portrayal.

The trouble is that would have been pretty thoroughly horrifying for the NBC audience and how anybody could have justified that morally to Debra Tate (and I don't think that anybody can justify the show in its current state to her let alone something that came nearer the truth of things) I don't know.

"
Aquarius,"This got a second season?
"
Aquarius,"The lighting was terrible in this, so dark. I gave up. "
Aquarius,How in the hell it got a second season is beyond me. First season was shit. 
Aquarius,Good
Aquarius,NBC had a show called Aquarius?
Aquarius,You should watch 2 Broke Girls so that can get cancelled too.
Aquarius,You should watch better shows. 
Aquarius,I'm not even liking The Carmichael Show on FB so they couldn't find me and hurt me again. Fucking NBC
Aquarius,"I understand.  Just watched both seasons within the past month or so.  A great show?  Not by a long shot.  But it was Duchovny and, well, it tried.  But too many character and plot threads competing for very little air time.

"
Aquarius,Uh... where did you get that from? They cancelled hannibal because of low ratings. They gave aquarius a second chance to prove itself. Why would they have to cancel Hannibal to keep Aquarius? They were made by different people...
Aquarius,*Hannibal* was just as lucky to get a third season as *Aquarius* was to get a second.
Aquarius,I'm still praying to [generic higher power] that Netflix will pick Hannibal up once any Amazon Video/other contracts expire. Know it won't happen but I have to live for something.
Aquarius,At least the finale was amazing :(
Aquarius,"While it's not as good as Hannibal (what has been on broadcast TV in recent years) I like the show. I'm about 3/4 through season 2 as it took a bit longer getting the second season over here in the U.K. about unless it totally falls apart in the last few episodes I will be sad to not get another season, especially as I read they planned for a 5 season arc (although season 2 does seem like they maybe saw the writing on the wall and accelarated the timeline)"
Aquarius,"Honestly, because it's NBC and it was a drama/thriller, it was doomed from the start, it was the wrong fit for such a high quality show. 

To me, it would be like taking a show like ""Game of Thrones"" and making it suitable and approachable for a TNT drama. Totally wrong network, totally wrong audience. ""Game of Thrones"" is for HBO. Period. 

NBC was a death sentence from the start for Hannibal.
"
Aquarius,"Powers got two seasons. The Wolf And The Diamond and Who Killed Retro Girl. Penny Dreadful got 3 seasons. House Of Lies got 5 seasons and kind of sucked for the last two. Bloodline's got 3 seasons. Hannibal got three seasons. The Following got 3 seasons.

These are not unfortunate one and dones, 3 seasons is a fair rope to hang yourself with if you haven't succeeded yet."
Aquarius,I blame lost somehow 
Aquarius,No and no.  
Aquarius,Star power? lobbying? desperate hope? idk.
Aquarius,"I guess. There was another show on CBS called ""Zoo"" too..."
Aquarius,That will get canceled too.
Aquarius,[removed]
Aquarius,"I don't get why Aquarius got a second season. I gave it four hours of my life for season one, four hours I will never get back. "
Aquarius,Amazon wanted to pick Hannibal up for a 4th season but wanted Fuller to be fully hands on which he couldn't commit to due to other commitments within the timescale Amazon had in mind
Aquarius,"I liked Powers, I'll miss that show, damn you Sony every year is harder and harder to support you!"
Aquarius,Always blame Lost.

Lady Dynamite,"for y'all who didn't click through:
>Netflix is not moving forward with more episodes of “Lady Dynamite,” *Variety* has confirmed.
>
The network did not comment on a reason for this decision. However, series star Maria Bamford, like her character, is living with bipolar disorder, and late last year she told *Variety* she has had to adjust the schedule of shooting the show to make sure she stays healthy.
>
“With the TV show, that was generally more than I could do,” Bamford said. “I had a 12-hour turnaround last time, and doing that on such heavy psychiatric meds, I was just half-asleep almost the entire day. They did such a beautiful job last year — they made me a “Bam-cave” that I could shut myself into so I could shut out the noise and take a nap. And I got to take a full hour for lunch. They were very kind.”
>
Bamford also said she had expressed that if she were to do a third season, she would have needed “children’s hours.”"
Lady Dynamite,"Really sad to see it go but I really don't think any other networks/streaming services would've given a show like this two seasons. Excited to see what Maria Bamford does next, I hope she makes another special!"
Lady Dynamite,"Completely unsurprised, but still sad to see this headline. The final episode actually makes for quite a good series finale.

Maria Bamford is still uproariously funny and I hope we keep seeing her in different projects."
Lady Dynamite,"Probably for the best. Somehow, thanks to Peak TV and Moneybags Netflix we were blessed with 20 episodes of this incredibly strange, beautiful, compassionate show. That's still amazing to me.

Here's to Maria Bamford being freed to do what's best for her health."
Lady Dynamite,"Very creative and unique series, sad to see it go. Bamford is a great comedian!"
Lady Dynamite,Terrible! I thought Season 2 was even better than the first.
Lady Dynamite,"I have to admit to being a bit crushed by this news. Lady Dynamite is one of the funniest, most poignant & stigma defying shows out there. As many people have stated I’m not surprised it was cancelled due to how insanely weird it is but that doesn’t make me any less sad to see it go. "
Lady Dynamite,Great while we had it though
Lady Dynamite,"I loved S1. But season 2 just didn’t really capture me in the same way. It felt like it was making a lot of crazy stuff just for the sake of it and it completely derailed. And not in a good way. 

Sad to see it go but not surprised at all."
Lady Dynamite,"Season 1 was crappy, but season 2 was actually pretty good. Shame."
Lady Dynamite,Bboooo!!!!!
Lady Dynamite,"I wasn't a fan, but the show proves Netflix is making content nobody else is making right now. One of the weirdest and fastest moving shows you'll ever see."
Lady Dynamite,"I had a feeling this would happen, but at least the show ended on a happy note. Plus I got to see Maria Bamford naked. :P"
Lady Dynamite,"Im more bummed for Maria than the show, I hope she find other endeavors, she’s a gem."
Lady Dynamite,"I remember reading that the first season took a lot out of Maria Bamford, so I wouldn't be surprised if she is kind of relieved that Netflix didn't order a third season."
Lady Dynamite,Does it conclude properly ? Or does it end on a cliffhanger ?
Lady Dynamite,I didn't find it funny at all 
Lady Dynamite,Watched the first few episodes of S1 and really didn't like it.
Lady Dynamite,"I love her comedy but the show sucked. Too weird for me, like a bad acid trip."
Lady Dynamite,Owned.
Lady Dynamite,[deleted]
Lady Dynamite,I remember watching the 1st episode of this when it first came out. like damn it was terrible. 
Lady Dynamite,I have so much respect for Maria Bamford. Her mental health is her number one priority and I love her for that. 
Lady Dynamite,"Aw darn. She made a fun, original show though, definitely be rpoud of that accomplishment."
Lady Dynamite,"Same. I absolutely loved this show - was incredibly strange/hilarious, and turned me on to Maria Bamford. Will happily be following her career going forward."
Lady Dynamite,"I felt the opposite. Season 1 is great, S2 lost me completely. I do like Maria Bamford and I hope she finds another project, or at least does some more stand up."
Lady Dynamite,Ooooommmm goes the dynamite
Lady Dynamite,It ends in a perfectly satisfactory way.
Lady Dynamite,You’re fucking incorrectly. 
Lady Dynamite,I'm sorry someone was making you watch it. :(
Lady Dynamite,"I loved the show, it reminded me a bit of 30 rock but this was even crazier"
Lady Dynamite,I think mental health sometimes makes itself the number one priority wether you want it to or not. She is a gem and I hope for her the best.
Lady Dynamite,What a *darn* shame..
Lady Dynamite,"She released a special on Netflix last year, if you haven't seen it yet I highly recommend it. It's fantastic"
Lady Dynamite,Same here.  She deserves to be more well known than she is. She is an amazing comic. 
Lady Dynamite,"I love maria bamford, so I'll watch anything she's in."
Lady Dynamite,is sarah silverman getting hotter?
Lady Dynamite,"Oh my god yes please. I love Maria Bamford. 

And the other cast members / guest stars are like a list of people I love. Lennon Parham, Jason Mantzoukas, Andy Daly, June Diane Raphael, Tig Notaro, Adam Pally, Patton Oswalt, Jenny Slate, Sarah Silverman, Ed Bedgley Jr. I can't wait.

"
Lady Dynamite,"I've liked Maria Bamford for a while, and am a little surprised it took this long for her to get her own show.  

I'm also glad whenever I see Andy Daly on a show.  It'd be amusing if the doctor he plays here turns out to be the same, incompetent one he played on *Silicon Valley*."
Lady Dynamite,Is that Brendan routh I keep seeing briefly? 
Lady Dynamite,"visit /r/ladydynamite if you like the show, the shows looks funny as hell and Maria is always amazing."
Lady Dynamite,"Maria is very funny, but also extremely annoying at the same time, it's a weird feeling you like someone's joke but don't want that person to be the one telling it when that person is a comedian"
Lady Dynamite,I am predisposed to root for anything Mitch Hurwitz does but this trailer didn't so much for me.  I'll still give it a shot though.
Lady Dynamite,Looks pretty funny! And they got TWO Supermen guest starring. 
Lady Dynamite,why can't it be May 20th now?
Lady Dynamite,is that Dean Cain?
Lady Dynamite,fantastic 4!
Lady Dynamite,"I'm probably in the minority, but to me this doesn't look too good.

The main character in this shows seems have something legitimately wrong with her mentally. So when I look at her, I kinda cringe and feel kinda bad. Maybe that's what they were going for, but I'm not into it.

Kimmy Schmidt, Leslie Knope, Jeff Winger, and even Michael Scott aren't as ""out there"" as the person is in this show.

In the end the show will probably be serviceable, but probably won't be ground breaking."
Lady Dynamite,Oh man I was laughing my ass off during this trailer. This sold me looking forward to it . 
Lady Dynamite,This looks funny and great!﻿
Lady Dynamite,"Mitchell Hurwitz (my idol), Pam Brady and Maria Bamford... Uh yes please."
Lady Dynamite,"might just be my taste, but it looks awful. Didnt laugh once."
Lady Dynamite,This looks terrible 
Lady Dynamite,"Arrested Development season 5, please."
Lady Dynamite,I've liked Maria Bamford 
Lady Dynamite,"YES! I love Maria Bamford. Can't wait to see this.
"
Lady Dynamite,"She's one of my favorites
"
Lady Dynamite,Maybe this will help with the disappointment that Season 2 of Kimmy Schmitdh was.
Lady Dynamite,"Zouks!

The more Zouks the better."
Lady Dynamite,I'm so thrilled she finally got a show of her own! Her web series was amazing! 
Lady Dynamite,"It's just me or Netflix is doing tons of low quality shows? This looks pretty bad (even with many good faces), The Ranch was awful, Fuller House the same, Flaked it's ok but i expected much more... I don't know, maybe this shows are demanded for a casual audience?"
Lady Dynamite,[deleted]
Lady Dynamite,Fucking terrible trailer but I doubt the show will be as zany as they portray it to be.
Lady Dynamite,"Mitch Hurwitz + Netflix = Arrested Dev Season 4

Ugh that season sucked"
Lady Dynamite,"On a recent trip to LA, saw her perform at Nerdmelt, she was AMAZING."
Lady Dynamite,"The older she gets, the more I like."
Lady Dynamite,She mentioned on Howard Stern a while back that she got in shape after doing a nude scene in Take This Waltz.
Lady Dynamite,"Holy shit, that just sounds like an Earwolf podcast lineup. Just needs Scotty Auks and Lauren Lapkus. "
Lady Dynamite,I was thinking the same thing
Lady Dynamite,I love her but that special she did performing for her parents was just so cringy.
Lady Dynamite,"I think that's the way most people are, anyone who's seen AD anyway."
Lady Dynamite,"I haven't seen this trailer yet, but I find Netflix's trailers to generally stink. I wouldn't worry too much yet. "
Lady Dynamite,"I'm a Mitch Hurwitz fan, too but I'm starting to think he's a one hit wonder. Running Wilde and Sit Down Shut Up were both terrible.. Hoping to be proved wrong with this one."
Lady Dynamite,and off-brand Susan Storm.
Lady Dynamite,I'm going to upvote in case that's a John Mulaney reference
Lady Dynamite,yes
Lady Dynamite,Maria bramford deals with mental issues iirc. If anyone has the right and knowledge to play around with thst I think it's her.  Just a psa.  
Lady Dynamite,"After a quick Wikipedia look, this show appears to be mockumentary format. Also, Maria bramford (who is bipolar in real life) is playing a fictionalized version of herself. So all your complaints are kinda a point of the show. "
Lady Dynamite,"> The main character in this shows seems have something legitimately wrong with her mentally. So when I look at her, I kinda cringe and feel kinda bad. 

Her standup is this to the Nth degree, and I love it. She jokes about crippling anxiety and depression and bipolar disorder, but in a very atypical way. She's not talking her way through it or packaging it up for the audience, she gets crazy and surreal and just wacky to the point that it's scary.

I can see how her standup could put people off in a big way, or how a lot of people might not ""get"" it, but the one thing nobody can say is that she's boring or unoriginal."
Lady Dynamite,I feel the same way.
Lady Dynamite,Yup. I can't really empathize with what she is going through so I would just feel bad. I can't laugh when I legitimately feel sorry for someone. 
Lady Dynamite,"have you seen the Comedians of Comedy tour with her, Patton Oswalt and Brian Poeshn?"
Lady Dynamite,"No, they are reaching out to many different niches. You're not going to like all of them and that's ok. HBO on the otherhand has a ton of great shows, but they have a somewhat homogenous audience. Netflix is trying to appeal to more groups of people though releasing a variety of shows."
Lady Dynamite,"I think that they should leave Arrested Dev as it is, Season 5 would probably be pretty bad. There's a chance that it may be okay, but I wouldn't want to see this show lose its position as one of the best comedies ever made."
Lady Dynamite,I saw it as her taking her stand-up material into almost performance art territory. But yeah that special wouldn't be the best intro to that material for somebody.
Lady Dynamite,it is
Lady Dynamite,"I just finished that. 

Made a great companion piece to Hanninal Takes Edinburgh "
Lady Dynamite,Yes. 
Lady Dynamite,"November 10! I'm super excited for this, season 1 were one of the best shows last year imo. Maria Bamford is absolutely amazing, I recommend watching her latest special if you like her. "
Lady Dynamite,This show was so damn weird and awesome. Can't wait for the next season.
Lady Dynamite,"my favorite Netflix show, finally!"
Lady Dynamite,"This makes me so happy! It's definitely not a show for everyone, but Maria Bamford is a national treasure. The Sassafras Lady ""commercial"" made me laugh more than anything I've seen on TV in years.  "
Lady Dynamite,Every time I see Maria Bamford I think its Amy Sedaris for some reason
Lady Dynamite,oh maria! 
Lady Dynamite,Pterodactyl!
Lady Dynamite,one of the few shows I can say I couldn't make it pass the 2nd episode. 
Lady Dynamite,faaaantastic
Lady Dynamite,This is a bomb ass show
Lady Dynamite,I like the concept of Maria Bamford rather than the actuality.
Lady Dynamite,"Season 2?  I've never even heard of this.  Thanks Netflix, for correctly assuming that I'd never watch this."
Slasher,"I wanted a few more scary scenes but in the end, it was wacky enough to be enjoyable."
Slasher,It's not great but it's entertaining to watch. I also enjoy seeing the same actors playing different characters each season.
Slasher,"Season 1 was made for chiller, season 2 and 3 were netflix season 4 is shudder. So i can't comment on the later seasons. The quality of season 1 isn't on Netflix. Since it is an anthology series. That may help the other seasons."
Slasher,"If you haven't watched the other seasons, give each a few episodes to see if they grab you. Season one was not good.

Season 2 was great, love the isolated winter cabin setting.

Season 3 was fun, great kills, school settings are fun too.

Was not a fan of season 1, so I'm glad 2 was so much better, and 3 was still easily better than 1.

I didn't even realize season 4 aired last year. I know what I'm watching this weekend!"
Slasher,I remember chiller I miss having a horror dedicated channel
Slasher,Is it good though
Slasher,yes per the reviews on Meta and RT
Slasher,better than the gossip girl reboot for sure
Slasher,Fantastic. I can’t wait to check it out
Slasher,Slasher is so much fun.
Slasher,"Honestly scared to see how much cheaper Slasher can look. Doing a 19th century season, they must have a line on some leftover props from other shows. Bring it on!"
Slasher,"Kin was alright. Great actors, but the story got a little boring. Will watch season 2 though."
Slasher,"Oh that's good to hear - I'm a couple of episodes into Kin at the moment, and enjoying it quite a lot, so good to know there's more coming"
Slasher,I'm happy but somewhat surprised about Creepshow. Season 2 was decent but I didn't think we'd get too many more seasons out of it.
Slasher,"Anyone else read the title too quick and thought it said Badlands instead of Bloodlands, get excited thinking AMC realized how badly they wasted Into the Badlands, and were gonna bring it back, only to re-read and be crushed by disappointment?"
Slasher,Neat! I like *Creepshow*!
Slasher,Creepshow is so fun! So happy to see it keep going.
Slasher,"It really is. Stupid, gratuitous fun. Also, season one had a pretty solid opener even if the story that followed was relatively meh compared to seasons 2 and 3.

Really wish Netflix kept the streaming license as I still haven't seen season 4 yet."
Slasher,"Yup. It's the campier, more Canadian version of the Scream show and thereforrre better."
Slasher,"Coming to AMC Summer 2022: Madge Minh, Lot 4D9, Halston? Kitsch...Fire!"
Slasher,"Doesn't even have a chick with giant tits spinning in the rain screaming ""WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR!"" over and over."
Slasher,"Um today I learned ""I Know What You Did Last Summer"" is based on a novel from the 1970s that has an almost entirely different plot from the movie, the only similarities are ""group of friends accidentally hit someone with a car and don't report it to the police""."
Slasher,[deleted]
Slasher,Critics said that about the actual movie too and it was still very fun
Slasher,"Why does it have to add something?  I hate those takes.  Is it as good as majestic tv series like GoT? No but I am on episode 5 and it’s a decent show for what it is.

Edit:  should say up to episode 5."
Slasher,"That pink stuff with a certain consistency on their faces though
https://i.imgur.com/nQbHXkp.jpg"
Slasher,"What's the problem? If its have good kills and a OK story I'm fine, I watch slashers for that"
Slasher,"At this point, what's left to add anything new? Kind of an obvious genre."
Slasher,"> The Amazon series shares little in common with the movies, begging the question of it using established IP for something otherwise unrecognizable that may do more harm to its audience perception in the long run than good.


> The general “I Know What You Did Last Summer” premise is still the same: After covering up a hit and run, a group of friends is stalked the following summer by a serial killer who taunts them and picks them off one-by-one. Boiling them down to their requisite archetypes, the TV show’s friend group is comprised of twins Lennon and Alison (Madison Iseman), rich girl Margot (Brianne Tju), Nice Guy Dylan (Ezekiel Goodman), wrong side of the tracks misfit Riley (Ashley Moore), and gay best friend Johnny (Sebastian Amoruso)...

> The answer to the question whether Amazon’s “I Know What You Did Last Summer” could stand on its own merits, if not for the title, is that this series could easily be far more effective as a movie instead. As it stands, it’s unfortunately just an overlong story that an otherwise talented cast has to work hard to land."
Slasher,Was this inspired by shawn mendes and camilla cabello?
Slasher,I had no idea that this series even existed. I'm definitely into watching it.
Slasher,"Hot take: you should not expect innovation for a spinoff/remake, for every Better Call Saul there has to be 10 that are just fan service or out to milk a franchise's last value"
Slasher,Does it need to add anything new?

This is the slowest burning slasher show ever. 0 slasher kills so far WTH. I was expecting something like the Scream series.

Please tell me it gets better."
Slasher,I’m liking it.
Slasher,"https://www.reddit.com/r/IKWYDLSTVSeries?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share

I created a subreddit for the show, anyone interested in discussing the show should come join!"
Slasher,So obviously this show isn’t high brow television and it’s not meant to be but it’s such a great level of trash that i can’t stop watching. I think the sisters (Allison and Lennon) were on it together and the hit and run was not actually an accident. Both sisters were very depressed and clearly mentally unstable. I think Lennon thought she was giving Allison the ultimate gift by coming up with the plan for Allison to hit her and then take her place in life. This would make sense so we know Allison didn’t take the SATs and Lennon was clearly bored of her life in the town so the sisters made this murder pact so Allison could get out and live a better life. They were both pretty twisted and disturbed so I wouldn’t be surprised if they both agreed but then Allison has regret and guilt over it afterwards l. Will be interesting to see how it all plays out though.

Slasher,"Yeah,  it's enjoyable junk TV."
Slasher,"The title is definitely a weird flex.  It could just as easily be, “Variety Review Adds Nothing New to Online Media.”

They’re both pointless content that some people enjoy consuming in a format that is familiar and mostly the same each and every time.

So maybe focus on whether or not it’s any fun?"
Slasher,"Eh, kind of an also-ran of 90s horror. No scream, that's for sure."
Slasher,"I'm not interested at all in this series so have no idea whether it's good or not, but blaming a TV show for failing to add something new is stupid. Having one that is both compelling and entertaining is already more than enough."
Slasher,"Exactly, it's the slasher genre and it's a remake of ""I Know What You Did Last Summer"" - who's expecting it to add anything new."
Slasher,"Ikr. I was looking at the reviews on Amazon and they basically all say this series sucks because it's not the movie.

Edit: how are you on episode 5 btw aren't there only 4 released?"
Slasher,"I guess tv shows and movies aren't allowed to exist if they aren't doing some twist on something. They aren't allowed to just be enjoyable. 

My impression was that most people like slasher movies just because they're a fun, scary time, so I wouldn't expect most slasher movies or tv shows to add anything new. They're just Hallmark movies for people who are in the mood for chase scenes. They don't all have to reinvent the genre."
Slasher,I truly hate game of thrones for what it did to television. There’s a certain sect of the population that can’t seem to enjoy any series because it doesn’t compare to what that show was. Not everything needs to be a cultural phenomenon and world shaking.
Slasher,">The Amazon series shares little in common with the movies,

Sure, it's different, but the same."

Slasher,It gets better. Way more slasher
Slasher,I think you're confusing that with Scary Movie o.o
Slasher,"Not OP, but it's slightly better than Scream with much higher production value. Hard to judge off only the first half but I'd say they have done a good job with the central mystery. It's got me hooked."
Slasher,"There are no chase scenes, like there are on mtv scream, usually they find the the body or u see the kill happen but no exciting chase sequences whatsoever, which i found weird, aside from that its ok but the killer does not feel scar at all, its veru weird. Weird choices were made by the creators"
Slasher,"I'm imagining a Variety reviewer walking into a movie theatre going ""This slasher movie is finally going to be the one that's high art, I know it!""

But can you believe 'I Know What You Did Last Summer' isn't literally Ingmar Bergman? Wow."
Slasher,"Agree, not every show has to add something new"
Slasher,Should have said up to episode 5

Slasher,"""We'll always remember he was this tall!"""
Slasher,Dun dun dun
Slasher,"Fun fact, Maitland Ward, the actress who played red head Rachel, is now in porn."
Slasher,I don’t remember this one but it sounds perfect for my Halloween episode marathon!
Slasher,They forgot the “here’s why” on this super cliche title
Slasher,"Certainly one of the more memorable episodes of the series, that’s for sure! My favorite , for sure."
Slasher,The witch one was way scarier
Slasher,My favorite episode of boy meets world
Slasher,"Is this the one where Shawn, the master of horror, finds out who the serial killer who killed all his friends was? If it is then that I got nightmares for days... who wrote that episode."
Slasher,Boy Meets World's best episode but I wouldn't say scariest in the slightest.
Slasher,The virgin part was funny too- good episode
Slasher,Growing up with the last name Feeny while this show was on has forever connected me to this show.
Slasher,"I feel oliged to post this, lol.

Slasher,When I was in like 2nd or 3rd grade I remember being really freaked out by the Phil Of The Future episode with the cyborg/android thing that came from the future and was walking around the high school. It may have looked like the main girl. I don't remember exactly. I just know it got to me for a long time.

Shark,The live edition of shark tank was a failure - luckily it was (so far) a one time deal.
Shark,">	25 years ago

I know covid has ruined everyone’s sense of time, but this is just egregiously wrong."
Shark,The lawyer Barry Zuckerkorn jumped over a shark in Arrested Development and I thought that was pretty good.
Shark,">25 years ago

Ah yes, 1997, I remember it well.  Seinfeld was halfway through its final season, the Beanie Baby craze was sweeping the nation, Henry Winkler turned 52, Google started up, Titanic was the biggest movie ever, and The Fonz jumped the shark.  Good times!"
Shark,"I know it's had inconsistent writing for years, but *Fear the Walking Dead* really bit it for me this season.  Strand was a full-on psychopathic dictator who just decided to switch teams after killing countless people, and everyone was pretty much cool with it.  Alicia decided to walk off into the sunset for...reasons.  Madison came back years after her last appearance.  The endless scenes in the radioactive wasteland that was both incredibly dangerous requiring a bunch of protection and something that wasn't dangerous at all so we could see actors' faces."
Shark,When riverdale added multiple universes and super powers it made it no longer watchable. Many would probably argue it was bad before that but the show just changed and completely fucked it’s recipe
Shark,Killing Eve
Shark,"Legacies

Technically the first jump the shark moment was when a DUDE MELTED INTO GOO AFTER HAVING SEX! but it somehow got worse after that when they brought in gods who names where Ken, Jen and Ben. 

Like how did we go from names like Klaus Mikaelson and Stefan Salvatore to fucking Ken."
Shark,"I dipped out of walking dead once they found like the 3rd town that had power, gates, a mini running town


And Rick and his gang screwed it all up for them.




Seriously like 3 years after a zombie apocalypse how many towns can be operating"
Shark,The Rookie. They found a criminal who was a doppelganger for one of the officers and had that officer pose as him undercover. When they found the criminals girlfriend she was ALSO a doppelganger for a female officer who has unresolved sexual tension with the first officer. The most unrealistic and fan service-y plot.
Shark,The Handmaid's Tale. Should have ended after season 3 IMO
Shark,Three Pines almost literally did that last episode. There was a random bear who stopped a police chase.
Shark,I don’t know what people are smoking. Fonzie jumping that shark was the best episode.
Shark,Frank Marshall liked to remind people that Happy Days had over 100 episodes *after* Fonzie jumped the shark.
Shark,I still like the show and I'll definitely watch the final season but I'm gonna say The Umbrella Academy.
Shark,I mean Riverdale was never “quality” but the main characters getting superpowers was kind of out of nowhere
Shark,"It wasn't this year, but The Blacklist jumped when they said that Red wasn't really Red."
Shark,"I thought this season of Umbrella Academy was completely underwhelming, will wait for season 4 to determine if it Jumped the Shark.
They set up this epic Sparrow Vs. Umbrella narrative for season 4. The sparrows could have been a little more flushed out IMO, and deserved more screen time."
Shark,The Crown season 5 was underwhelming. Like it came and went without any of the fanfare or discourse we were used to in previous seasons.
Shark,Marvellous Mrs Maisel. It went from delightfully campy to straight cartoonishly dumb.
Shark,"Yellowstone, first 4 seasons were really good.  This new season is almost unwatchable...."
Shark,"Westworld. Spoiler tag for those who want to watch.

>!Season 1 was a masterpiece. Season 2 leans too heavily on the non linear structure of S1 and lacked compelling story. Season 3 was a total design shift. The story was interesting and the future world was fascinating, but it lost its soul a bit. Taking the story into the big bad world, making it about some random human and the plights of humanity was somehow less interesting than self aware robots and their makers. Season 4 just dialed it up to 100 but not in a good way. Full scale world domination plot lines. Human resistances. Robot utopia. Sounds cool but the execution was cheesy and forced. So many wasted or under utilised characters. It had lost that cerebral, analytical, thrilling element that pulled you so far into season 1. By the end it felt like a classic good vs evil, brain vs brawn, good guy vs bad guy trope. The best parts of the previous seasons were when those lines were blurred.!<"
Shark,"I’m putting myself out here because the fans are as equally fervent as the haters, but it must be said.

The Bachelor franchise."
Shark,"Russian Doll.  Loved the first season and while I watched the second season in its entirety, I almost bailed a few times.  The plot wasn't very captivating and something seemed different with Natasha Lyonne's character and/or acting."
Shark,Dead to Me was hard to get through
Shark,Dead to Me jumped about 3 sharks
Shark,"Hot Ones just did an interview/ad with PussnBoots. It seemed like people in the comments loved it and maybe it wasn’t for me, but I couldn’t help but think it had jumped the shark. I was already feeling like their lineup of guests had begun to fall off. Then this."
Shark,… 25 years ago? Fonz jumped the shark in 1977.
Shark,"Why do people keep saying that jumping the shark is when the show is at it’s peak? It’s not. A well loved show will have peaks and troughs in quality, and so you forgive it when it has a decline in quality.

Jumping the shark is the moment you’re watching an episode and realise that it has slid further than a usual dip in quality, and is likely never to climb back again. You know that future peaks are going to be lower than previous troughs. That it won’t ever be the show you remember and love.

There’s a chance that moment happens at a peak. You can watch supernatural season five and realise that this is the best the show will ever be. But more likely it happens when a small(ish) town thug trying to turn his life around goes waterskiing in California in a leather jacket."
Shark,"Handmaids Tale S5. Good fucking god. Went from excellence to an absolute nightmare. Awful dialogue, acting, pacing, plotting, writing. I cannot stress how lazy and ridiculous the dialogue has gotten. All around shitshow; season 4 was arguably just as bad too but S5 is proof that the show is lost. 

Which is weird because lots of the fans still seem to be vibing with it."
Shark,"Marvelous Mrs Maesel (sp?).  The Ferris Wheel scene was cringe, along with a few others.  Not sure what they're thinking.  Plot has gone off the rails too...refusing to be an opening act?  Suzie being a mob employee without knowing it?  What used to be cute is now just stupid."
Shark,For All Mankind leaned in on the worst characters and doubled down on the worst story beat from Season 2 to continued diminishing returns. Made what felt like it could be a shark jumping moment in S2 absolutely one in light of S3.
Shark,Flight Attendant
Shark,Definitely the Goldbergs it’s over
Shark,Yellowstone started jumping the shark last season but this new season is god awful
Shark,[removed]
Shark,"Criminal minds reboot. Early seasons of the original were mostly singular episodes based on catching one killer. Even arcs where they had a big baddie over multiple episodes felt more “special” and believable. 

The newest episodes have >!a whole network of nationwide serial killers!<, someone who is under arrest gifting Penelope a kitten (at Rossi’s suggestion), and things like senators who are apparently so *all-powerful* that they say they can shut down the entire BAU with a single phone call (??).  

Also a weird side storyline where we’re supposed to believe JJ’s home life is some sort of compelling and domestic marital bliss, with that creepy, dead-eyed husband who should totally be playing a murderer instead."
Shark,"For me it’s Yellowstone. I loved the first few seasons and now it’s just the same old shit over and over and over, with Beth’s character really being the straw that broke the camels back for me. She’s become insufferable and for me, I won’t be finishing this season."
Shark,I know it's not quite 2022 but i think Witcher season 2 needs to be mentioned.
Shark,"Gangs of London. End of episode 2 had me saying ""oh come on"" out loud to myself, and that's where I bailed. 

Even up to then it was poor compared to S1."
Shark,"Reddit doesn’t know what jumping the shark means. Even the comments that try to correct people are wrong. 

Jumping the shark is when a show is losing interest and does a stunt to generate buzz to get people to start watching again. 

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jumping_the_shark"
Shark,"RuPaul's Drag Race because if there's one thing all the international seasons have done, is show how much more talented, creative, original, and cultural queer people from around the world are as opposed to the US drag queens, which tend to be predictable, instagram-ready, mostly the same, and twinks.

People say that all these new spinoffs killed the show bc there's too much to keep up with but they killed the show in that now a lot of people are realizing how boring the US seasons have been compared to everyone else. They're practically a snooze fest."
Shark,"Thought it was 18 years ago

https://youtu.be/4jm6B31HKBw"
Shark,The Masked Singer. The show is all about the hosts now.
Shark,Yellowstone - it’s so clearly a merch machine now. I can’t even get through Season 5.
Shark,Shhh Reddit don’t shame. OP suffers from goldfield’s syndrome.
Shark,"Does no one in here -- including OP -- know that ""jumping the shark"" refers to a decline in quality *as evidenced by far-fetched sequences like the Fonz jumping a shark?*    

It doesn't just mean the show got worse -- it means something left field and desperate happened to keep the audience interested."
Shark,“Jump the shark” does not mean “I didn’t like it”. I cannot stress that enough.
Shark,"Thursday Night Football. It's been great since 2006. One season on Prime, and boom! From the penthouse to the shithouse."
Shark,Billions
Shark,Credit to Jon Hein
Shark,"ITT: Declining shows

What I wanted to read about ITT: Declining shows, with an actual ""jump the shark"" moment"
Shark,"Harley Quinn, the relationship stuff was fine, but reducing the supporting cast and dialing down the jokes isn't"
Shark,Westworld
Shark,This seems like a fun question that was completely derailed by poor math. Won't be the last time.
Shark,Idk if this counts but Peaky blinders season 6 was garbage.  The writing was half assed
Shark,The final season of Search Party. Show went from trying to find a missing friend to a zombie apocalypse
Shark,Yellowstone
Shark,Final season of Ozark. Just bad
Shark,Goldbergs properly jumped it for me this year when they made his dad die because they sacked the actor and that Adam took a year out from going to film school (to get film experience in Philly?!?!) just so his character could remain within the sitcom world. Stupid
Shark,"Snowfall — the tiger was wild enough, then the drug-infused wedding just took it to new levels of “what are the writers smoking?!” Don’t think the average Redditor watches that show though lol"
Shark,I feel like the obvious answer is *Ozark*. It ran out of plot in the third season and decided to just turn its characters into weird caricatures of themselves that constantly have big arguments that lead nowhere.
Shark,Boba Fett’s entire show felt like jumping the shark but for Mandalorian. What an utter shit show.
Shark," Cobra Kai
I love this show but the premise is getting thin. They really need to wrap up this story because we are just going in circles at this point. Luckily, it has a goofy comedy aspect to it so I still enjoy watching it but Im just not invested into the characaters as I was the first 3 seasons or so."
Shark,Big mouth. A show that started great and just kept getting better spent this season doing way too many musical numbers and making all their likeable characters unlikeable. Pretty obvious the best writers of the series have already moved on to focusing on Human Resources (the spin off)
Shark,I’m going to get crushed for this but IASIP. I’m a huge fan but that last season was outrageously bad .
Shark,"NCIS continuing on without Gibbs was questionable, but I finally gave it up this year when Gary Cole stuck around."
Shark,"I don’t know if this counts, but in the last season of Californication when Hank learns that he has a son.  That kid was an absolute moron."
Shark,Yellowstone for me. It’s the same stuff every season
Shark,"Snowfall had everyone on acid for an episode, it was an act of revenge from a hollow version of a great character from the gang war the previous season"
Shark,Yellowstone.
Shark,Jon Hein?
Shark,Mythic Quest has not had a great season thus far.
Shark,The Rookie.  Their new recruit sees auras and pulls over cars based on them as well as using dreams to solve crimes.
Shark,Stranger Things
Shark,Killing Eve
Shark,"I hope things get back on track, but this season of The Dragon Prince was really disappointing. Also don't understand why the season title was ""Mystery of Aaravos"" when he appears for like 5 minutes the whole season."
Shark,Boba Fett didn’t need to ride a Rancor
Shark,"For All Mankind

S1 was great

S2 was okay….

S3 what the fuck?"
Shark,The Handmaid's Tale.
Shark,Yellowstone. Season 5 is absolutely boring.
Shark,I can’t think straight because you said the Fonz jumped the shark 25 years ago
Shark,"I saw that Joyce Hyser had her 65th birthday yesterday. I was like “no way that means I’m old!”.

I am indeed old. I don’t like threads like this that make me think “no way it’s been xxx many years… but it is.”"
Shark,Umbrella academy felt pretty meh
Shark,"Holy crap, I remembered a good one. The Chilling Adventures of Sabrina. >!She found out she was Lucifer’s daughter and was tasked with becoming ruler of hell. She finally proofed herself after being challenged for the role, and then decided to do the stupidest thing ever and paradox herself into having a copy of herself so that she could go back to Greendale and live life as a teenager. Lucifer disowned her and her copy rules Hell with him and fell in love with the challenger. This created so many damn problems for no reason, and it completely ignored all of the character growth from learning to not mess with stuff and not thinking of consequences.!< The last season was just plain ridiculous"
Shark,The Walking Dead. Man that show is done.
Shark,Jumping the shark is a mark of the start of decline. If a show jumped the shark in 2022 it will be too early in some (many) cases to know yet.
Shark,Such total disregard for a dying man's shark jump...
Shark,"Bachelor in Paradise this last season was so drawn out and less dramatic than previous seasons. Sure, the tell all was great, but did we need to watch 87 episodes to get there?"
Shark,Big Sky  and the Good Doctor. Both have lost there luster. Hard to even watch.
Shark,"More importantly though, did any shows this year ""Grow the Beard""?"
Shark,"Big Sky.

Edit: word"
Shark,"The Good Doctor, but I think they re-jumped because they already jumped a season or two ago. Also, New Amsterdam, also again. Shut them down!"
Shark,Young Sheldon. Show has gone south big time
Shark,Yellowstone.
Shark,"NCIS… multiple times

1. Ziva’s departure 
2. Tony’s departure 
3. Bishop’s departure (and the reasons for it)
4. Gibbs’ departure (even though I like Parker, it’s not the same)

Each one is a shark jump for a segment of fans, but obviously, Gibbs is the ultimate shark jump. CBS has been doing a bunch of crossover episodes (including one in January that involves all three  NCIS franchises. I makes me believe that they know this is the series last season."
Shark,"Yellowstone 

Season 5 has been a big letdown, cringe-fest."
Shark,Billions
Shark,The Goldbergs - the mama getting all mad because the grandkid had a mrs Claus stuffed figure in her crib.

The Maria Lang Collection,Love it. Katy Manning still delivers the same energy to portraying Jo Grant. I appreciate these sorts of things so much.
The Maria Lang Collection,"Thanks, Perd."
The Maria Lang Collection,"Such a great trailer, really enjoyed it"
The Maria Lang Collection,Cool
The Maria Lang Collection,Stay away from my young!
The Maria Lang Collection,Katy is scarier than the Silurian.

The Maria Lang Collection,"This is absolutely incredible. Holy shit, it goes right to 100 immediately and then just KEEPS going."
The Maria Lang Collection,This is a meme classic. When she turns over the wheelchair lol
The Maria Lang Collection,"This is a wild show. My mother loved it.

&#x200B;

Edit: I had to go see if I was remembering the show correctly, when passing through the living room and seeing the insanity. A brief review from wikipedia says,

>In an attempt to reconcile with Nando, Soraya arranges a party and invites him. Nando goes to see Alicia and Soraya, who has a crisis of psychopathy, beats her, hits Esperanza against the wall and cuts Nando with a pair of scissors. Alicia is saved by Aldo, and Nando goes to a hospital, where he is admitted. María reported Soraya but she pretends to be innocent. With the idea of revenge, Soraya finds her mother, Calixta. Calixta, too poor and ill, lives as a beggar, and recognizes her daughter. Feeling hatred towards her own mother, she pushes Calixta, who hits her head and dies."
The Maria Lang Collection,"You could literally make about 37,000 gifs from this scene alone, how did only one “make it famous”."
The Maria Lang Collection,My favorite part is how more and more people arrive but jut stare at the show. It would only be more realistic if they all pulled out their cell phones and started filming it.
The Maria Lang Collection,That slug insult was pretty harsh
The Maria Lang Collection,"Cliffhanger! He didn’t really die from an elbow stabbing, did he!?"
The Maria Lang Collection,"https://youtu.be/kSJDgREaeVs

Seeing this reminds me of this hilarious Funny or Die video, Telenovelas are Hell that covers Maria del Barrio."
The Maria Lang Collection,That guy looks like eric from boy meets world
The Maria Lang Collection,The watchword.... is subtlety.
The Maria Lang Collection,"In case y'all never saw Orange is the New Black poking fun at this:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HfPsCw8w45Q"
The Maria Lang Collection,"That’s it. We need an English remake starring Casey Wilson, stat!"
The Maria Lang Collection,And I thought the last episode of moon knight was intense.
The Maria Lang Collection,"Telenovelas used to be wildly popular in my country back in the 90s, I forgot how intense and highly emotional the characters can be. Maria del Barrio even had a local adaptation, but none of those tops Marimar though."
The Maria Lang Collection,"Shits wild. Also, as a native Spanish speaker some parts of the subtitles were not accurate but just made it funnier."
The Maria Lang Collection,"Someone once said to me, ""Telenovelas are just like British Soap Operas - just as intense.""

...Telenovelas are just insane all the time. British shows are mostly quiet, but then they really go there on rare occasions. Like Christmas."
The Maria Lang Collection,saw this before bed and this is the best 'thats enough of reddit for today' moment i've ever had
The Maria Lang Collection,Thank you. That was wonderful!
The Maria Lang Collection,"I remember when this show was on, for some reason I always had to watch it whenever I passed by it changing channels. I don't even speak Spanish, but it was so bad  you couldn't not watch it."
The Maria Lang Collection,I swear mexico and bollywood just plagiarize each other in an endless cycle.
The Maria Lang Collection,This is absolutely hilarious.
The Maria Lang Collection,Such an iconic scene. I would've been glued to the screen had I watched this on TV.
The Maria Lang Collection,"This clip has been imprinted in my soul for years. 
It's just perfect cringe. It is a rarity. Nothing comes close. 
It should be protected for posterity"
The Maria Lang Collection,Seeing the one ginger dude made me think how this wouldn’t be out of place on Riverdale.
The Maria Lang Collection,Telenovelas peaked here
The Maria Lang Collection,Looks like something Jack Donaghy had to micro-manage
The Maria Lang Collection,Now... THAT escalated quickly!
The Maria Lang Collection,"OMG, what did I just watch? This is hilarious."
The Maria Lang Collection,"Nandito is trying very hard not to touch her boobs, which I find very funny."
The Maria Lang Collection,Was anyone else expecting a cut to the mac and me clip
The Maria Lang Collection,"Go Punisher on them, girl ! They deserve it ."
The Maria Lang Collection,"Deam, is like watching pro wrestling"
The Maria Lang Collection,She tips the crip at 1:26.
The Maria Lang Collection,"ahahah, that's some shounen villain level of rage, glad Cristiano Ronaldo was finally able to restrain her. Did Nandito die though?"
The Maria Lang Collection,"So, did Nandito die from the stabbing? Please use spoiler tags so as not to spoil the show for others!"
The Maria Lang Collection,"First, that woman is giving complete Casey Wilson vibes. Second. I don’t everyone walking in at the end like “what in the fuck is going on in here??”"
The Maria Lang Collection,"This makes a few episodes of Arrested Development s1 even funnier.  

https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/El_Amor_Prohibido"
The Maria Lang Collection,Reminds of that clown telenovela scene that kept popping up in The Soup with Joel Mchale.
The Maria Lang Collection,"Here in Chile even my mom knows that meme, and she barely uses Whatsapp."
The Maria Lang Collection,An iconic moment in mexican television
The Maria Lang Collection,I stumbled across this clip a few years ago. I seriously couldn’t stop laughing.
The Maria Lang Collection,Which Episode Is This?
The Maria Lang Collection,"Every character is emotionally at 11, except for the main lady who's at about 23."
The Maria Lang Collection,"It gets wilder.
Calixta is a witch.  Maria is Nando’s mom by her adoptive brother, and is like 15.
Maria sold him to a random woman for sausages, anyway she finds him 15 years later.
Soraya dies a couple times and tries to bbq Maria twice."
The Maria Lang Collection,"This used to play in my home country of Cyprus of all places, alongside stuff like Rosalinda and some other similar telenovelas. Pretty hilarious stuff honestly ."
The Maria Lang Collection,I mean all telenovelas are weird
The Maria Lang Collection,"Lmao

Every frame a painting, but absolutely insane gifs."
The Maria Lang Collection,"For some reason I can't stop trying to picture the rehearsal, and how they managed to co ordinate all this entirely counterintuitive shuffling around."
The Maria Lang Collection,"I like the part where wheel chair girl says ""she killed you both for protecting me"" but the dude is very clearly still alive. Novelas are wild."
The Maria Lang Collection,">Take the girl and go!

*stops at the door*"
The Maria Lang Collection,the only reason they didnt is because it's '95
The Maria Lang Collection,">It would only be more realistic if they all pulled out their cell phones and started filming it.

It was 1995. That wasn't possible."
The Maria Lang Collection,I lost it when Cristiano Ronaldo walked in. Dude's an even better actor than he is at sports.
The Maria Lang Collection,"This is the best part. Nobody called the police and/or an ambulance. There are like 10 people in this room as if the first ones said to the others ""hey! come see this shit on the second floor!"" 😂🤣"
The Maria Lang Collection,Unless you’re Oliver P Morton post-stroke who somehow made getting called a slug sound bad*** dragging his paralyzed self around the Capital.
The Maria Lang Collection,"When, in the entire history of humanity, has anybody ever died from an elbow stabbing?"
The Maria Lang Collection,"I hopelessly check Funny or Die's youtube channel every now and then to see if there's a new Telenovelas Are Hell. 

There never is. :("
The Maria Lang Collection,"Reminds me of the Chris Farley decaffeinated coffee crystals sketch. “Sir, did you know you’re not drinking regular coffee but Colombian decaffeinated coffee crystals?”

https://youtu.be/VdQKVDUBu2g"
The Maria Lang Collection,"All these years I have resisted OITNB for some reason, and looking at this clip I see I may have been mistaken."
The Maria Lang Collection,"…how tf do you cry in Span… ohhh, right. Yeah that’s right. -me"
The Maria Lang Collection,Can i amend that to be Casey Wilson as Penny from Happy Endings?
The Maria Lang Collection,"> Someone once said to me, ""Telenovelas are just like British Soap Operas - just as intense.""

Yeah, that guy fucking lied. That made British soaps look like The Wire."
The Maria Lang Collection,And continuously!
The Maria Lang Collection,"This thing started to convince me that telenovelas are on to something because a) I could not take my eyes off the screen, and b) I was DESPERATE to know what happened next."
The Maria Lang Collection,Spinal tap 11
The Maria Lang Collection,Every sentence more thrilling than the last.
The Maria Lang Collection,Sold for sausages!
The Maria Lang Collection,well that certainly escalated
The Maria Lang Collection,"I've only ever met one person from Cyprus in my life and the first thing they mentioned when they learned I was Mexican was: ""Maria la del barrio!""."
The Maria Lang Collection,"Nah, sometimes they're just cheesy and boring. But the more melodramatic they are the better, because that at least makes them worth the watch."
The Maria Lang Collection,Bold of you to assume there was a rehearsal.
The Maria Lang Collection,Time travel is though
The Maria Lang Collection,A stab to the brachial artery could kill you pretty quickly
The Maria Lang Collection,It's crazy that novelas I watched as a kid are apart of Telenovela from Hell. I too wish they made more and check often.
The Maria Lang Collection,"It was rarely like this, though it had its campy and surreal moments."
The Maria Lang Collection,During her mexican exchange student year in High school.
The Maria Lang Collection,"Well, I mean, purely for the sake of all those actors' air traffic control."
The Maria Lang Collection,Nandito! Noooooooooo!
The Maria Lang Collection,How medically accurate of them.
The Maria Lang Collection,"They have incredible fidelity to realism, but only in that one very specific respect."
The Maria Lang Collection,"If you don’t find value in the service then vote with your wallet and cancel. The only one that can answer your question is you. Because your opinions, financials and free time differ from everybody else."
The Maria Lang Collection,I subscribe and unsubscribe constantly to multiple streaming services. It's extremely easy and very little work. I legitimately do not understand why more people don't do it. Sub when you want to watch something. Unsub when you don't. Save your money.
The Maria Lang Collection,">Is it worth maintaining a subscription?

Does anyone really need to ""maintain"" something that you can cancel and subscribe whenever you want?"
The Maria Lang Collection,"What drives me crazy is that Netflix won't sell the rights to shows they cancel, so they have no chance of ever getting a finale season or movie. 

When Santa Clarita Diet was cancelled, Drew Barrymore tried to buy the rights to make the show under her own production company that was ALREADY co-producing the show. Netflix told her to get lost."
The Maria Lang Collection,"Since they raised the price to $20/mo in Canada we started rotating streaming services. It's working out really well.  The kids are excited for new content every month, and they vote for what one we get each month. 

There's a beauty in constraints."
The Maria Lang Collection,[deleted]
The Maria Lang Collection,"""Inventory of Broken Dreams"" absolutely sounds like a show that Netflix would greenlight and then cancel."
The Maria Lang Collection,"There's lots of good shows that have had many seasons or a good ending. Bojack Horseman, Stranger Things, Ozark, Never have I ever, Dark, Big Mouth, Atypical, etc"
The Maria Lang Collection,"We Mean It This Time, This Is The Final Straw For Netflix

--/r/television, for the 400th time this year"
The Maria Lang Collection,season 3 of I think You Should Leave
The Maria Lang Collection,I like the korean shows.
The Maria Lang Collection,"At one point they had so much content that even when they didn’t have anything new to sell you they had enough old shit it was still being worth subscribed.  They were the one with the deepest library so they’d usually have some show or movie you’d like to watch.  Once that all got split up amongst a dozen services it just became another service you renew whenever it’s got enough new stuff piled up.

I don’t think they’re any worse than any other network though. They cancel shit I love because I love weird shit that not many other people love and so the shit I love is rarely popular enough to be renewed. If I held a grudge against every network that cancelled at least five or six shows I loved I would have no networks to go to.  Do I pray that someone invents a replicator so we live in a post scarcity society and art no longer needs to be profitable?  Hell yeah. Am I going to throw a hissy fit every time I’m reminded that still hasn’t happened?  Nah."
Spotless,Amazing show that did not get the respect it should have.  Esquire went through some issues causing it to flownder.
Spotless,Yeah it was great. Shame it didn't get more traction.
Spotless,"Just finished it and loved it! Dark and funny. 
So bummed there’s only one season. I’m hoping Netflix will take it and run with it"
Spotless,Yes!!! I really loved this show and kept checking back from time to time to see about a S2. I always thought Nelson Clay was one of the best villains. Great acting by Coyle.
Spotless,It was pretty good and I'd recommend it to anyone who enjoys the Breaking Bad format.
Spotless,Did I miss something at the end? Are we supposed to know what happened? Or was it because they fully intended to reveal all in season 2 but then went bust?
Spotless,I remember reading that there would be a season 2.
Spotless,Just get old.  You won’t remember shit.
Spotless,"As someone reading the ASOIAF books right now, I wish I could forget having seen GoT.

Also I wish I could forget the last season regardless."
Spotless,The Wire.
Spotless,Pilot of Friday Night Lights.
Spotless,I would do this just to erase memories where I get spoiled by something.
Spotless,I wish I could do that with GOT up to season 6 and then just forget that it carried on beyond that.
Spotless,ECT is pretty good at that...
Spotless,"> Just get old. You won’t remember shit.

I was born during the Truman Administration. I'm holding off on watching Malcolm in the Middle for a while longer, until my RNA has deteriorated to the extent that it's fresh and new.

If I took ruffees (sp?) when I watch MITM, that would obliterate the memory, right, so I could watch MITM *every day* and still enjoy it as (almost) new?"
Spotless,"> I wish I could forget the last season regardless.

Whine, whine, whine."
Spotless,Whats ect?
Spotless,> **Electroconvulsive therapy** (**ECT**) is a medical **treatment** most commonly used in patients with severe major depression or bipolar disorder that has not responded to other treatments. **ECT** involves a brief electrical stimulation of the brain while the patient is under anesthesia.
Spotless,Damn sounds brutal
Spotless,Yeah it's horrible my mom has had over sixty ECT treatments and her memory is completely shot.  She doesn't remember my childhood and she'll forget what she did or said just 15 minutes prior.  She can't hold a job anymore and before the ECT she was an amazing nurse but she turned in her license because she feared she'd hurt one of her patients by forgetting something important.
Spotless,i am sorry for you and your family. may i ask if she did it to combat depression?
Spotless,Yes
Spotless,Oh Shit Uncle Rico
Spotless,Odd title. It's what Netflix's Maniac ripped off of.
Spotless,Just call it Psychonauts the show if you're talking to reddit
Spotless,This show is a great deal better than Eternal Sunshine. 
Spotless,Why?
Spotless,"No Kaufman, no deal for me."
Spotless,"At first thought, I don't like it. The movie was as perfect as it could ever be and I don't understand what the ongoing story would be. Memory erase of the week? Or will it be the movie expanded over a season or seasons?

But Anonymous Content is packaging it (the company behind Mr. Robot, True Detective, and The Knick) and the original producer is onboard... So I'll give it a shot but I don't expect anything as close to the movie."
Spotless,Over under on it being a police procedural?
Spotless,This actually seems like one of those moments where I'd like my memory to be erased 
Spotless,Man the movie was so good. 
Spotless,Yeah it sucks Kaufman and Gondry wont be involved but the premise of the story is too interesting to dismiss just because of their lack of involvement. If you're expecting an attempt to recreate the same feel of the film then you'll be let down because no one can emulate Kaufman. Given Anonymous Content's track record I think it'll be worth checking out.
Spotless,"I'd like it to be new characters but same sort of setting, with the mind wiping stuff."
Spotless,"If they Fargo it, I have no problem. Give me quality. Also, I hope they avoid reusing the two characters from the film. Their story is told, so new characters would be much better. "
Spotless,"Oh, really don't know about this.  This film was perfect on it's own, I don't know how they'd approach this.  There has been some decent executions like Fargo but I can't see them pulling it off.

If the latest fad is remaking TV shows from movies why not try The Truman show instead?   Lots of directions they could go with that."
Spotless,can't three be something new like stranger things.
Spotless,"Let's face it, people said the same about the Fargo tv series. It's all about execution."
Spotless,member berries
Spotless,"I thought the same thing and it's one of my favourite films.

But, then again, I thought the same thing about Fargo being made into a TV show and I loved it.

So fuck it. Let's see what happens."
Spotless,"Why not? This seems to be a new thing for TV at this point- take a well-known movie/brand and make a TV show with the same title. It guarantees you initial interest and viewership with a built-in fanbase, even if you make a show almost completely unrelated to the source material, like Fargo, or to a lesser extent Hannibal. "
Spotless,"No Gondry, no deal for me. "
Spotless,Kaufman truly defies the auteur theory
Spotless,"Yeah, that was my first reaction. 

""OHHHH! Is Kaufman involved? I'd love that! ...No? Well no interest. Sorry."""
Spotless,The Coens didn't put any of their creative effort into Fargo and look at that masterpiece of a TV show.
Spotless,"No kaufman / Gondry, no deal, I agree, but to be honest, even with them on I wouldn't want this to happen..."
Spotless,"Exactly  

Sadly for Kaufman his name won't get a deal these days either :D  "
Spotless,I'm amused around trying to think of how to turn into one.
Spotless,darn tootin'
Spotless,Fair point. Fargo is one of my favourite shows that I rate equally as good as the movie.
Spotless,Or Jane the Virgin
Spotless,Exactly this.
Spotless,What?
Spotless,"Possibility: 

A murder happens. 

All the co-conspirators wipe the event (from the planning to the final act) from their memories. 

Cop has to find the people involved who don't remember the other people involved to solve the mystery.

Plot twist: Cop was a part of it all along!!!! Oh no!!!

Plot twist on steroids: *Everyone* in the show was part of it all along!!!!"
Spotless,A reference to a recent south park episode. Literally berries that say nostalgic phrases.
Spotless,May he Rest In Peace. He has made wonderful shows. Wish for his family to find peace since he died relatively young.
Spotless,[deleted]
Spotless,"Yes, and it is definitely worth watching! It was this random little show that I stumbled upon on Esquire, and decided on a whim to watch it- great decision, the show is awesome. It totally took me by surprise.

The whole premise is fascinating and the plot is pretty great throughout. Good characterisation as well. I highly recommend it!

Only one season out currently (although it's pretty self-contained, there aren't many, if any, cliffhangers it leaves on), but I believe another is in the works, to be released at some distant time in the future. So it's not too much of a time investment either."
Spotless,"Yep. It felt like a European, dark comedy version of Breaking Bad , minus the drugs. 

Totally worth a watch."
Spotless,"Yes, is good. Canal+ produce great series"
Spotless,It's very good. Would be much more popular if it wasn't completely unpromoted when it aired originally. Most people dont even know Esquire is a channel and there was nothing about it in the uk/ireland.
Spotless,"FWIW, I haven't seen it, but my dad just told me today that it's well worth watching.  He also mentioned a slight Breaking Bad vibe. Looking forward to it.  "
Spotless,"It's dark, slightly funny at times, def worth checking out "
Spotless,"Nice and gritty. Full of character faults and karma. No good guys to get in the way of obsession, betrayal and destruction. Although I think it needs cheerier music..."
Spotless,"I thought it was fantastic. 

Really hoping for another season."
Spotless,Is it a serialized or episodic show?
Spotless,"Serialised. Each episode has a plot, but it's within the larger plot of the show."
Spotless,"But you didnt tell us what its about!
"
Spotless,I always saw it advertised on like Esquire I think and it looked great. I'll have to check it out now that it's on Netflix!
Spotless,[deleted]
Spotless,"Came here to post something similar. I had never heard of this show before and it wasn't easy to find on the net (don't have Netflix). How a show of this quality seemingly slipped into obscurity is beyond me.
Only 3 episodes in and i'm completely hooked.

The two brothers are fantastic, especially Denis Menochet, who briefly appeared in Inglorious Basterds (French guy hiding the Jews at the beginning). Really pleased to see more of his acting abilities in a sharply written and well acted tv series. Humour is on point as well. I can tell I'm gona have fun with this one! Check it out if you can!

"
Spotless,Sorry! You can tell from my history I suck at posting.  I'll edit.
Spotless,Yep.  Not for the faint of heart.
Spotless,When are they releasing it in english? I think the french version is out but they've done a really bad FRENCH DUB. Can't hear that shit.
Spotless,"France/UK production. 

>Set in London, SPOTLESS is the story of a troubled crime scene cleaner

"
Spotless,US release please?
Spotless,It's on right now. On Sundays I think. It's on demand with Comcast/Xfinity right now. And it is AWESOME
Spotless,It's coming out this fall on Esquire 
Spotless,It's coming this fall to Esquire
Spotless,I saw that. No date?
Spotless,"Haven't seen a date other than ""fall"" "
Spotless,November 14th
Spotless,I found that show stayed fairly consistent. I enjoyed it all the way through and wanted more at the end. 
Spotless,"Is the acting as good as Harvey Keitel, because I feel like he's easily 80% of the reason people like The Wolf."
Spotless,"I have trouble with Spotless, and I don't watch it anymore. The guy's job is mopping up brains, but in his spare time he walks around in beautiful suits, like he was in a men's magazine. I speak French, and it's one of the world's great cultures. But the French have a long way to go before their TV dramas are worth watching. Marseilles was also not that good. "
Spotless,"You were right to stop watching. 

I told myself I would stop watching and didn't. 

It didn't get any better. 

They don't understand the characters. They don't understand the narrative. 

Fran would not have attempted suicide. She should have mourned her father AND the world that was lost. Her child was always a symbol of the old world. 

Mother Abagail ran her own homefront on land her family owned for almost 100 years. She killed her own chickens. It took all day but her strength and faith always carried her through. They left her abandoned in a nursing home at the start of her story here. 

Nick was a man who stayed to nurse the man who assaulted him while he died. They jumped past this.

Lloyd wasn't a douchebag he was a person who made some bad choices. 

The trashcan man WAS NOT whatever that caricature of a velociraptor was. 

You're 100% correct about the jumping narrative. It worked for IT. It RUINED this adaptation. The world takes 1 month to implode. It takes time to travel in this collapsed world. We needed to see the characters as they were become the characters they are and they jumped RIGHT over it. The opportunities they had to show society collapsing and they completely fumbled it."
Spotless,"I stopped after 5 episodes.
Harold got way too much screen time. Meanwhile Flagg was criminally underused. New Vegas being some debauchery fun house was the worst decision, aside from the non-linear storytelling.
As boring as it was, it also feels like skipped over a lot of the story too quickly. The gore of Captain Tripps was unnecessary. Yeah, I can't think of anything positive about it and I really wanted to like this show."
Spotless,"Sadly I feared this would be the end result when I heard cbs all access of all streaming services got the rights. A shame, I feel like hbo would have nailed it"
Spotless,I will say this: the hand of God and ball lightning in the most recent episode looked badass. But they edited the scene in such a way that it suggested Trash changed allegiances and brought the nuke downtown because God told him to? It's just fuckin' bizarre.
Spotless,">I feel like I was watching an ad for the GAP.

Squeaky clean sports cars parked in random, awkward spots on the street, while lightly crumpled newspaper rolls by. 

""dystopia"""
Spotless,"First The Dark Tower and now this - why do adaptations of my favorite King books always have to turn out the weakest?

Here's hoping Øvredal's The Long Walk will deliver (if it even happens)."
Spotless,"I’ve never read the book but I remember the 94 miniseries so I was intrigued when I saw the previews for the CBS version. Was disappointed in ep 1, disappointed again in ep 2 but I thought, maybe they’re ironing out the kinks. Then by ep 3 I knew there was no redeeming it. I then stayed on to see how ridiculous it could be. 

***SPOILERS***

If Hemmingford Home turns out to be a retirement home instead of a home in a cornfield...why did everyone dream of a cornfield??

I’ve posted this everyplace I could: I am convinced that Ezra Miller based his Trashcan Man on Terry Gillium’s Mad Jailer character in Life of Brian!  https://youtu.be/6Bv0SovOLwM

Dayna is the worst possible spy!  Dear god in heaven, the only way she could have been more obvious that she was up to something is if she would have walked around Vegas with shifty eyes, twirling a mustache, and doing evil giggles. 

Nadine’s deterioration make up: “I like turtles!”

Flagg dancing!!!!

Edit: thought of something funnier."
Spotless,"Between this and The New Mutants, Josh Boone is turning out to be an one-hit wonder."
Spotless,"I gave up after ep3 as well, but I had to have a look at the Trashcan Man's opening scene after I heard all the shit about it. My god, did they go over the top with him...

So yeah, it doesn't seem to get any better after ep3."
Spotless,"Yes, a company that is not CBS needs to take it on.  I love The Stand but couldn’t get through episode 2.  I’m very disappointed because I was really looking forward to this."
Spotless,"We should have known it was going to be shit, look at what CBS did with ""Under the Dome"" it started about a 3rd into the book, and had stuff that just didn't happen in the book.... Quit that one after the 2nd episode...."
Spotless,"The out of order decision was a horrible one, it’s somewhat ok for anyone who’s read the book but for those who have not it must be very confusing and too much is given away at the beginning"
Spotless,"The dude that plays Harold is absolutely excellent, and does a great impression of Jim Carrey doing weird impressions. 

Pretty much the only saving grace of the series. I was legit saddened by his death. Nick on the other hand...Lloyd's girlfriend has more screentime than one of the most fan favourite main characters from the book. Did my man dirty..."
Spotless,"That sucks, especially since the 95 miniseries has such an iconic opening scene/credits."
Spotless,I enjoyed it.
Chelsea,"I used to watch her show ""Chelsea Lately"". It was good. Her interviewing was pretty good in that she was never a suck up to the celebrities and would call them on their bull shit from time to time.

However, her limitation is that she is mean. Mean to guests, mean to staff, mean on interviews with other hosts."
Chelsea,"Idk, I feel like after Noah’s tenure they’ll want to change things up and look for someone funny"
Chelsea,So she can run another comedy show into the ground?
Chelsea,"The issue here is that she’s not actually aware of politics or world events at all. She has rich liberal Hollywood knowledge, which is to say she’ll retweet the odd campaign or echo whatever Anderson Cooper says, but its surface level bullshit. Trevor Noah was only like 10% better but at least he had a more interesting upbringing/perspective. 

I actually don’t mind her, the cold brutally honest comedian asking actors jarring questions can be funny, but this is a stay in your lane moment."
Chelsea,Is the daily show about drinking and having sex with 50 cent now? Interesting turn
Chelsea,noooooooooo^ooooooo^^ooooooo
Chelsea,She was catatonic and apathetic in her deliveries. The 3 guests who preceded her did a far superior job.
Chelsea,She’d fit perfectly with the untalented and humorless night hosts
Chelsea,maybe they only person they could choose less funny than the last buffoon. Please do it!
Chelsea,No. She probably shouldn't.
Chelsea,Should have been Jessica Williams all those years ago.
Chelsea,I felt like they fucked up not giving it to Jason Jones back in the day. Jordan would be who I feel like could give it that older Daily Show feel now. I never could get into Trevor. I tried. I really did but the edge that Jon had was massively dulled with Trevor. He was to nice.
Chelsea,Tim Baltz  could be a  good choice
Chelsea,"""I want a job!"""
Chelsea,"uh, no thanks.  Wanda was much better host"
Chelsea,I’d prefer Samantha Bee. But it really should be Roy.
Chelsea,"chelsea handler is an incredibly out of touch white liberal and would basically turn the daily show into colbert, with very little in the way of any actually interesting political commentary. 

people like stewart and oliver( and even noah post trump) are obviously wealthy liberals too but they’re more in touch with everyday people and recognize that both parties are controlled by corporate interests, which is why they don’t pull any punches with neither republicans nor democrats, and why they were able to find more success."
Chelsea,There’s other good suggestions in the thread but I’d also watch Hasan Minhaj
Chelsea,"I watched a few clips with her and I'd be fine with it. There's a self-awareness there that's pretty charming. 

But in watching these various hosts **people are sleeping on the correspondents.** Dulcé Sloan, Desi Lydic, etc. are way funnier and natural than the big names."
Chelsea,"They're running low on milquetoast liberals, huh?"
Chelsea,"This might sound crazy, but hear me out....I think Daniel Tosh would kill it.  He was always a good presenter, and he has matured a lot."
Chelsea,"No. No she shouldn’t. She’s the worst. Wanda is 1,000 times better.

Honestly, if they were smart they’d pony up to entice Fey or Poehler to take the helm. They have a proven track record doing satirical news and before Noah drove it into the ground the show was the top of the mountain. This could give it the boost back."
Chelsea,She’s great and would be a welcome change from the Noah snooze fest.
Chelsea,I don’t know … I could see her as a female Bill Maher of sorts.
Chelsea,"She has a good chance. If any post midnight show puts a white dude as host, social media would lose its mind. Sorry but that weirdly includes an Asian host (don’t ask me why, I do not get it either). 

Really there are only two host options - a black female or a white female. Black male is out because Trevor just did it and choosing yet another male, regardless of race, would cause backlash but not as strong as a white dude. Yes this all applies to @midnight relaunch too.

Anyone of the female “correspondents” past or present can do it but Comedy Central isn’t going to allow it. The execs will be thinking “we need a name, someone that will drive ratings”. That is part of the reason the weekly rotation of hosts exists to see if their auditions show potential.  Also consider no Comedy Central exec has chosen a host in 20 years as Trevor was Stewart’s choice and saying no would have looked bad considering it was “historic” at the time. They are going to want to do something “historic” too.

So far the first three did a meh job, so by default Handler is in the lead mostly thanks to previous experience making her feel natural in the role. Still another month or so to see if others do better."
Chelsea,"Bitch openly fakes a service dog and admits it.

She's dead to me.  So fucking wrong for so many fucking reasons."
Chelsea,"I liked her first episode, but I kind of hated that ""just chatting with my pals"" news review thing she did on the second episode. Their conversation was lame as hell. Now I'm actively hoping she doesn't get it, as it fees like she would bring entirely too much of that ""shallow Los Angeles celebrity nonsense"" energy with her.

So far, my preference is still for giving it to Roy Wood Jr."
Chelsea,Is that her name or occupation?
Chelsea,Why not just put up a sock puppet with a speaker so the writers can read from biased scripts? Same difference since that’s all these shows are. Regurgitated talking points.
Chelsea,"Should probably wouldn’t do worse than the dismal -350,000 viewers per show it got under Noah. The Daily Show is done. They should just retire it."
Chelsea,Roy!
Chelsea,I’d prefer if they had Desi Lydic.
Chelsea,Give it to Roy Jones. Dude could carry the show. She's so meh.
Chelsea,"I watched her all week and it's been awful. Tired, tone deaf jokes, punch down comedy. That attitude I just can't take. And i love a confident woman, Leslie Jones and Wanda Sykes were incredible! I wish I could unwatch all episodes with her and sincerely wish her to not be a regular host."
Chelsea,Is Chelsea the permanent new host or just tentative while they look for someone?
Chelsea,"yeah, i have read at least one book of hers and we watched *Lately* religiously, but i know she is mean.  i guess the tradeoff is that she is not like Ellen and a super smile on teevee and a cunt in back."
Chelsea,Listened to call her daddy podcast and she was so rude on that show.
Chelsea,and nobody wants to see a mean lady aka b word
Chelsea,Ouch that hurts because it's true
Chelsea,[deleted]
Chelsea,She didn't want it.
Chelsea,Ziwe is pretty good
Chelsea,Da fuk?
Chelsea,"i actually like Roy too.

different, but good different."
Chelsea,"Roy would be good. Any of the correspondents would be really but not going to happen. It will be a female host and I bet one not already working for the show with execs thinking that will lead to a ratings boost. They always forget the key to late night is consistency, not gimmicks."
Chelsea,"If Dave Anthony was offered it, I think he'd be a good fit."
Chelsea,"i would at least like to entertain this thought!

do you think he could do a suit and tie though?  i kind of expect it from the host."
Chelsea,Yaaass or Nathen Fielder
Chelsea,I'm annoyed by how common that is because people take their god damn dogs everywhere now
Chelsea,You are right. What you see is what you get.
Chelsea,"yes, I agree but she straddles the line between good interviewer that doesn't kiss celebrity ass and unpleasant person that makes interviews awkward because she makes little nasty remarks and comments."
Chelsea,He was good in the Faculty.
Chelsea,"No, they didn’t. I remember people saying he’s a step up from Craig Kilborn."
Chelsea,Sssshhhhhhhh ^I ^know.
Chelsea,I’ll be honest only lasted a year of watching daily with Trevor. Was an avid watcher for a decade under Stewart. And I’m 31. No idea who ziwe is but I’ll give it a DuckDuck (͡•_ ͡• )
Chelsea,As long as he avoids any scandalous behavor we're good 👍
Chelsea,I don’t think a host being a woman is a gimmick.
Chelsea,Why don’t they then promote one of the female correspondents? Like Desi Lydic?
Chelsea,I don’t know him. I’ll look up some clips
Chelsea,"There's a few pictures out there of him wearing a suit, and he rocks it.

But regardless, I would be totally fine with a cardigan-wearing Daily Show host..."
Chelsea,[deleted]
Chelsea,"Hiring a celeb just cause celeb is a gimmick. Hiring one of the female correspondents to be host would be a natural promotion. Which isn’t going to happen.

Oh yeah, I acknowledge your virtue signaling. The world is better for it and blah blah."
Chelsea,I agree with you. You’re getting downvoted but you’re right. I remember when he was chosen. People assumed because he was from MTV he sucked.
Chelsea,"I’m not signaling anything. I’m just responding to a comment I found odd. If my comment seems virtuous, that might be on you.

And hiring a well known celebrity to host a show isn’t a gimmick. That’s pretty standard."
Chelsea,"Ooh, nice. Mark Dacascos is awesome and a great martial arts actor."
Chelsea,Looks like The Chairman's secret ingredient for this week is going to be itchy onions.
Chelsea,Holy Fuck! I know Chelsea! Good for her!
Chelsea,"Man I love this show, thx to Reddit for introducing me to it."
Chelsea,"The article doesn't mention Penny, wonder if she is a goner or if this is just a (deliberate) oversight."
Chelsea,"Very excited for the next season, and Dacascos is a great addition."
Chelsea,James Hong needs to be in it!
Chelsea,"Yea, but i still only see him as The Chairman"
Chelsea,He was good in Wick 3.  Threw some amazing kicks and was a beast with that sword.
Chelsea,"Loved him in Only the Strong, back years ago."
Chelsea,I hope he plays a chef...
Chelsea,Allez! Cuisine!
Chelsea,He's the Crying Freeman for me
Chelsea,"Fuck but Wick 3 wasted him, just like Wick series in general got wasted in Wick 3. 

The dude has charm, the actual movement for martial arts (I'm sry, but holy hell Keanu looked stiff when he fought any of the actual martial artists and the same went to Matrix). 

Just let this crow CAWWWK again in all his glory."
Chelsea,Brotherhood of the Wolf was great too
Chelsea,"ba-na-na-waaaay

People think Mazda when they hear that ""zoom zoom zoom"" song but I think of Only the Strong."
Chelsea," >(I'm sry, but holy hell Keanu looked stiff when he fought any of the actual martial artists and the same went to Matrix).


His back been fucked since the Matrix it's why he looks stiff"
Chelsea,"I agree that while the world was expanded in JW3, overall there was no progress of the story which was disappointing. It was still done well action-wise, so I rewatch it from time to time, but in terms of where the character ends up at the end vs at the beginning, it didn't give much."
Chelsea,"Omg, totally forgot about that!  
Gonna have some catching up to do this weekend."
Chelsea,I think I need to adopt you as my sibling.
Chelsea,"It's actually ""[Paranaue](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qj-VHOp2myk)"" and the only reason I mention that is because I was on Team Ba-Na-Na-Waaaay for fucking years before someone corrected me, and now I'm paying it forward."
Chelsea,It's a great movie. I saw it in theaters and felt like a crazy person trying to tell people about it. Like the marketing was shit for the movie
Chelsea,My whole life is a lie...
Chelsea,"Hah! I felt the same way, man. It gets better."
Chelsea,"> When The Daily Show returns from hiatus on January 17, 2023, a slew of comedian and celebrities will take over the hosting duties. Sitting behind the desk will be Chelsea Handler, D.L. Hughley, Leslie Jones, John Leguizamo, Kal Penn, Sarah Silverman, Wanda Sykes, Al Franken, Marlon Wayans, and former The Daily Show correspondent Hasan Minhaj. Eventually, a permanent host (or multiple, apparently) will take the reigns of the show, with current correspondents already being eyed for the gig."
Chelsea,"The show needs an American host, like John Oliver."
Chelsea,Give Jordan Klepper the seat
Chelsea, I thought Shane Gillis was taking over?
Chelsea,"Damn, didn't realize Noah was so disliked."
Chelsea,Now we just need to replace Jimmy Fallon.
Chelsea,Stewart/Colbert retired like 6 years too early
Chelsea,I can’t even stand the commercials of what are supposed to be his funnier moments
Chelsea,i hope the next host is funnier
Chelsea,He picked a good time to leave. After that interview of Will Smith where Trevor had his head so far up Will's ass that you could hear him speaking through Will's mouth I was done. Never have I lost respect for someone so quickly.
Chelsea,I didn't know the Daily Show was even still airing.
Chelsea,"The show will forever be obscure. The beauty of the daily show was it was unique and a satire on stiffs in the media. It had a balance to it and ribbed every side as needed. Now with podcast, YouTube etc. The unique platform that was the daily show and eventually colbert report doesn't exist anymore. 

now the closest thing left is Real Time and Last Week. But even those aren't peak daily show/ colbert report."
London Spy,One of the worst endings ever
London Spy,It's really good in some ways. The characters are great and tension is really high in the first couple of episodes but it's not able to bring it home on a plot level. 
London Spy,First episode catch me. Cliffhanger and thriller was good. Then in goes to something not so good.
London Spy,"I'm never going to watch it, what happens? "
London Spy,it's all a dream 
London Spy,"Yeah i've watched the first two episodes, I like it but I really have no idea where it's going and I think that's the best part."
London Spy,It seems someone started a /r/LondonSpy sub 9 months ago.  I'm going to head over there to layout my theories. 
London Spy,[deleted]
London Spy,Is there any way that I can watch it here in the US?
London Spy,Freamon from The Wire makes an appearance. The 2nd episode was really good.
London Spy,Let's start a discussion there!
London Spy,Unquestionably.  The only place I've found it discussed on reddit is /r/britishTV.  I swear in the next 3 weeks we will all be speculating about it like the first season of True Detective. 
London Spy,I know a guy who used to date a girl whose ex step-mother-in-law downloaded it from the internet and didn't get busted or feel too terrible about it because it isn't available outside the UK. 
London Spy,http://www.bbcamerica.com/london-spy/
London Spy,You go!!  Is Alex actually the son of the people that finally claimed themselves as his parents or it yet another red herring?  Does Danny have some spy training?  So many of his actions lead me to think maybe so. Where does Scottie really fit into all this?  I think episode 3 is going to be available in a few hours.  
London Spy,https://www.reddit.com/r/LondonSpy/comments/3tyk9v/danny_doesnt_get_the_joke_london_spy_episode_3/
London Spy,Except its a BBC America co-production so that's BS. 
London Spy,"My guess would be that Danny is a street smart 'kid'. Remember how he jumped the queue at the club in the first episode. Maybe he was/is not only a drug user, but also a dealer? I don't know about the parents, but would very much like Charlotte Rampling to stay in the story, the two of them are just phenomenal together. I don't know what to think of Scottie."
London Spy,"I'm not finding a way to watch it online from the US, but you you could provide a link, that would be lovely.  "
London Spy,"Its not on BBCA yet, but it will be soon. "
London Spy,"I found the show to be meandering. 

If you are going to watch the show, don't go in expecting a spy thriller. It's really more about relationships."
London Spy,"Shit, I clicked on a Verge link."
London Spy,"Yeah....no. Slow. Hideously so.  And without the payoff you get from other, better programs with deliberate pacing.  I would imagine, if I were homosexual, or maybe a homosexual activist of some sort, I might find call to identify with the two main characters.  Unfortunately, beyond that, there isn't anything to recommend it.  Do not waste your time."
London Spy,"Couldn't possibly disagree more. It's very slow in the best possible ways. Tension building, atmosphere setting, cinematographically interesting, great acting. The character is a bit of a wanderer and we wander with him. Etc etc. Everything about the pace of this mini-series is well thought out and well judged.

The homosexual thing? What? You can't identify with the main characters just because you're not homosexual? It's not some kind of gay agenda thing. Really? You can still enjoy a window into another world."
London Spy,"We disagree completely.  It wasn't slow in any good way, it was just painfully slow.  And no, there was nothing about the main characters I found at all engaging, interesting, or anything I could identify with.  I think the show was terrible.  "
London Spy,Whoever came up with that title clearly is making too much money. 
London Spy,"Definitely eager for this. Whishaw has never disappointed for me in any of his roles.

Loved him in The Hour and in Cloud Atlas, even Skyfall where he stood around talking techno nonsense.


"
London Spy,"Produced by Working Title productions, no less. You couldn't make this stuff up. But then again... yes you could."
London Spy,"He is great, i'm looking forward to this as well.

However I'm still bitter about The Hour. I was hoping it would get at least one more season to rap things up but that's a long shot now. Luther just got a 2 part movie in place of a 4th season so maybe there is still hope."
London Spy,"I love the fact that this is airing in america

Sad also to see Rami Malek going home without prizes... Well i guess his trophy showcase at home is already full, so he's not too worried and hopefully will win more."
London Spy,ABED!!! Back on TV! Danny Pudi the GOAT
London Spy,Kristen and Steve for hosts of everything please!
London Spy,am i the only one that finds it awkward when someone *in* the movie presents the clip
Marseille,The headline is spot on in my view. The series is horrible - but I cannot stop watching it. It's classic soap opera with great camera work. I'm hooked. And ashamed!!
Marseille,"The expectations were set way too high. And if anyone knows the French cinema scene, they are obsessive about French made TV/Movies. Like it is of nationally debated topic.

Keep in mind, this was made completely by French show runners. Netflix just wrote the cheques. I think it's why it received even harsher criticism than it deserves. 

Just my opinion. Netflix trusted the team that made Marseilles, but the team had bigger ambitions. They wanted a home run and wanted to appeal to the entire world. Even possibly directed at the US market. Most likely for recognition. They should have made this strictly for the people of France. 

It's watchable, but not great TV. It is not as bad as the harsher critics make it out to be. 

I dont think anyone expected Netflix to hit a home run for the French audience. BUT I am hoping they will learn from this."
Marseille,Any opinions on this? I haven't checked it out so far because there's a lot of other stuff waiting. Is it really disappointing? 
Marseille,What's the original French for this?
Marseille,"This doesn't come as a surprise  

Yes maybe Netflix knows what they want to do and who they want to cater to, but that doesn't mean it'll work if you don't have the right people doing the right things  

"
Marseille,It's not nearly as bad as that newspaper makes it seem. I've only seen a couple episodes but found it... fine? lol . It's very similar to Boss with Kelsey Grammar. I'd give it a 7/10 and might be worth checking out. It's definitely no masterpiece but far from a disaster in my opinion.
Marseille,"Well, the problem with Marseille is that the editing is fucking terrible but it's not really that bad.

If anything, this show is the funniest French comedy since Kaamelott. Every use of horror/suspense music makes me laugh and every slow-motion scene where Benoit Magimel comes inside a woman is the funniest use of slow-motion since Naked Gun 2.

The writing is fine. It's Dan Franck as his most average, more average than Les Hommes De L'ombre. Depardieu is okay, and Stephane Caillard is the shining star of this series. She's a better actress than Kate Mara in House of Cards. But Benoit Magimel's raspy Batman voice is just the worst. He basically used the same voice from The Connection and I hated it.

I don't mind a Season 2 for this, but they should really drop all attempts to have a flashy American-wannabe TV show and instead embrace its Frenchness.

What makes French television great is that shows like Engrenages, Les Revenants and Une Village Francais are tranquil, low-key and non-flashy compared to American shows. I even liked Dan Franck's La Vie Devant Elles and that's because it has some sense of humility and doesn't try to present that torrid sense of flashiness that this show's trying to portray. Netflix France needs to embrace its Frenchness instead of using tired American cliches for the sake of an ""international audience"".

Hell, look at Narcos. It's even less flashy than Marseille. They should have used Narcos as a template to look up to instead of House of Cards."
Marseille,I enjoyed it.
Marseille,"Netflix got good shows to make its mark, now they have the capital to take greater risks with the content they make. They are one of the established players now, and so will have duds from time to time."
Marseille,"I kind of wonder if maybe Netflix will start making more of these shows that—to the discerning viewer—seem like steaming piles of turd? I mean look at what's been popular for the last decade: Big Bang Theory, 2 1/2 Men, Kardashians, Singing Show #2948932, etc. These are not what the average /r/television reader would consider quality. But they're *immensely* popular. 

It's great that Netflix can put out award-winning shows that rival the production value of HBO and the storytelling of Breaking Bad or Mad Men. But those cost a lot and are not the most accessible shows. As they've got to fight harder and harder for marketshare in a growing industry, maybe Netflix will have to start putting out cheesy French soap operas or canned-laughter Ashton Kutcher sitcoms just to attract a wider audience. "
Marseille,"> The headline is spot on in my view

The headline of the Reddit post or the article? Because the best article translation I can get is ""Red card for ""Marseille"", the first turnip ""house"" Netflix"""
Marseille,All reviews have been awful. Wanted to watch it but couldn't find one review...
Marseille,It has a pretty low rating on netflix so the general consensus is that it's pretty bad
Marseille,"""Un ratage tellement énorme qu'il en deviendrait presque fascinant."" Ratage isn't quite a failure in my mind, although earlier in the paragraph he explicitly calls it one."
Marseille,"Their other foreign series like Club de Cuervos and Atelier have been a lot more well received, though. "
Marseille,Was it that much of a non-surprise? It looked promising from the one trailer I saw.
Marseille,"The real issue is the lack of contents. Netflix was really welcome, but they have been ditching a lot of titles in their catalogue (even worse than in the US). If they get stuck between a dismal movie offer and mediocre house productions, they will lose market shares to French on-demand movie services, like those of Orange."
Marseille,"Agreed. Except Boss was excellent, IMO. "
Marseille,I kept thinking it was similar to Boss - although with a much nicer mayor. I agree with everything you said.
Marseille,"I've been considering giving this a look, but what stops me is that it's ""French"". I understand that it is an English speaking show, but is it, really? I'm a snobbish American. Will I be able to understand this?  
"
Marseille,People have a misperceptions that Netflix is trying to be like HBO in content. They are trying to be like HBO in business model - original content that attracts subscribers. The difference is Netflix doesn't want niche high end awards only content. They want ALL content because then they can get ALL subscribers they quite literally want every human on earth with an Internet connection to sign up for Netflix. 
Marseille,"May I direct you to [Richie Rich](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt4160920/), which has two seasons on Netflix? 

"
Marseille,"> out award-winning shows that rival the production value of HBO

No just no. 

Netflix is putting level entries popcorn television

Orange is the new black wich is just weeds trying to be intelligent

Daredevil Jessica jones, standard ""cape film"". A genre that is trending. Sure it's a level above the likes of ""the flash"" but not so much

master of none : well pretty balsy idea only counting on the popularity of parks and rec to sell the series unfortunatly it sux"
Marseille,"My apologies - I meant to refer to the title of this thread -  
**""French newspaper calls Netflix's new series ""Marseille"" a ""failure so immense it becomes almost fascinating.""**  
My French is not good enough to make much of the actual article."
Marseille,"Perhaps try it anyway because reviews are only the opinion and recommendation of other people, it's not as though you're not your own person with your own tastes and opinions, right?"
Marseille,low ratings mean you dont like it based on what you watch/how high/low you rate stuff on netflix
Marseille,Merci. 
Marseille,"lillyhammer, too"
Marseille,"Boss was cut way too short. Grammar hammed it up delightfully in that. And Kathleen Robertson, whew."
Marseille,Can you read? Then yes.
Marseille,I'm a bit confused what you mean. I was watching it with the French dialogue and English subtitles. You can always listen to the English Dub voices but that pretty much ruins any show for me.
Marseille,"When 1/3 of nighttime traffic is dedicated to their website, they will just want more. "
Marseille,thats kinda clever really
Marseille,I'm pretty sure the prime example is House of Cards
Marseille,"It roughly translate as 

Red card for Marseille the first in-house dud of Netflix"
Marseille,Really that's interesting TIL but it is still weird since i gave the english and the american House of cards a high rating and this show seems similar 
Marseille,That explains why things having higher/lower ratings between my profile and my boyfriend's profile...
Marseille,"She was really hot, thats all I remember about that show"
Marseille,"Ok, my bad. I was under the impression that there was some kind of controversy with this show over English speaking actors and so incorrectly assumed this was filmed in English."
Marseille,"i think we're already at about this number, at least in america."
Marseille,"House of Cards is great but I wouldn't consider it better than a lot of what they've done. DD, JJ, Sense8, Bojack, Wet Hot, Narcos, Bloodline...they're all pretty incredible. "
Marseille,I remember being excited when I found out this gorgeous blonde with great boobs in Boss was the same woman whose cleavage I fell for in Tin Man (the Wizard Of Oz show with Zooey Deschanel and Neal McDonaugh).
Marseille,"Versaille was like that, maybe you confuse the two show ?"
Marseille,May be.. Thanks. I'll look that up.
Marseille,"Not a usual user of the sub, but french and I lived a while in Marseille 

When Netflix came to France they promised to produce a french-like *house of cards* telling the story of the mayor of Marseille who is about to retire and all the young politicians who want the place.  French law forces TV channel to fund production of movie/Series. By producing something, Netflix avoid/postpone a law forcing internet streaming operator to do the same.  Moreover, Netflix selled the House of cards licence to a french TV channel thus, french Netflix users cannot watch *house of cards* 

Marseille is the second biggest city in the country, but one of the poorest. Mafia is still powerfull  there. In some poor blocks you can buy every illegal stuff  (Drug, weapon etc...).  1/2 years ago there was a gang war in the streets with someone killed by an AK-47 every month (but at least it was between gang members). The political class is often involved in corruption scandal ( I don't have the list of local politician who went to jail), and I don't talk about the political alliance sometimes unusual for a country with a strict line between left and right. Finally, the garbage collector union is quite powerfull and they usually strike one month per year. (It's the only place in the western world where I saw people burning the trash in the street) 

As you see that's the perfect background for a TV show. 
"
Marseille,"They could have called it *Château de Cartes* to be honest.

However, I'm still interested. Marseille was and still is one of the most perfect locations for a political/cops/criminal drama. It's got everything: drugs, weapons, corruption, guys who were found in a rubbish bag cut in 15 pieces (police concluded it was a suicide)... Good potential here."
Marseille,Is this a miniseries or a multi season show?
Marseille,"Not really much of a trailer, but I'd never heard of this and it sounds very interesting. Depardieu hype! "
Marseille,I wonder if it'll be avaliable in the US Netflix or if it'll be distributed by a channel. 
Marseille,All I know about Marseille is that George Stobbart visited its Docks in Broken Sword II
Marseille,"Isn't it just ""House of Cards"" in french? Practically the same theme music even."
Marseille,"should be neat, especially given that it's set in the beautiful region of provence so it should features some pretty sights and beautiful coasts."
Marseille,"Wow, hope there is some good rap from southern France.

Maybe something form AKH."
Marseille,Does anyone know if it's just in French or if there will be English translations or subtitles 
Marseille,"@ work, cant watch youtube...English subs, englished dubbed, French spoken?"
Marseille,fuck subtitles 
Marseille,"> It's the only place in the western world where I saw people burning the trash in the street

Naples?

"
Marseille,"> It's the only place in the western world where I saw people burning the trash in the street

Pretty sure i saw some English council refusing to pick up refuse for 5-6 weeks on the trot last year at some point because of government cuts to funding."
Marseille,House of Descartes
Marseille,Marseille is a better name for international marketing. 
Marseille,Multi-season.
Marseille,My thought too. You learn nothing about the show from that trailer.
Marseille,"At the end it says ""Worldwide"""
Marseille,That fucking dog...
Marseille,"They sell it like a french House of Cards / Game of Thrones / Narcos, indeed. However I don't think the feeling will be the same, House of Cards has a lot of black humor and this seems far more ""serious"". Also the township of Marseille has nothing to do with the White House."
Marseille,And maybe even a touch of The Wire
Marseille,There will be subtitles like there were for Club de Cuervos or Narcos.
Marseille,Sorry man. It's OK if you can't read.
Marseille,"Coincidentally, it's the setting of Gomorrah. 

Which is almost like The Italian version of The Wire. "
Marseille,It was an argument with the green party council in Brighton
Marseille,Thank you. Can't read French.
Marseille,Twenty!
Marseille,">  sell it like a french House of Cards / Game of Thrones / Narcos, indeed.   


three completely different shows lol  "
Marseille,Fun fact that The White House was almost named Marseille House in recognition of the French help in the war of Independence 
Marseille,To me it sounds like a cross between Boss and House of Cards.
Marseille,"This looks like it could have lots of dry, dark humor. The words used, ""liberty,"" ""equality,"" are intentionally used ironically here."
Marseille,[Here ya go](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1zTsG6wn4Q)
Marseille,"House of Cards for politics, Game of Thrones for the soap opera & power struggle, Narcos for drugs, mafias & stuff like that (which Marseille is pretty well known for)."
Marseille,It's described by the creators as a psychological thriller. Hard to know to what extent.
Marseille,"If reading subtitles is too difficult for you, no need to advertise your stupidity, just don't comment."
Marseille,"Also known as ""Maison de cartes""."
Marseille,"Comparing it to House of Cards just because it's political may be silly, but you can't deny the guy who isn't Gerard Depardieu looks like Claire Underwood."
Marseille,"Looks good. 

I'm not a big fan of Gérard Depardieu as a person anymore, but can't deny he's a great actor.

 I see people mentioning *House of Cards* but to me I'd see more of a connection to *Boss* (an underrated Starz series, check it out!). "
Marseille,"I'm French but I usually don't like french TV Shows, actors and movies. I'll give it a try though, cause Netflix."
Marseille,Why do people in this thread think it's an April fools joke? It looks like a pretty cool show and I'll give it a try when it comes out. 
Marseille,Where can i find english subs for this??
Marseille,"I want to like this - it looks promising although it seems derivative - see Forbrydelsen and Boss, but it truly is a Netflix original, not like a made by BBC series with ""Original"" slapped on it. It has 8 episodes, so no stretching out the plot - that's good. But Depardieu has seemingly been dialing it in for awhile, he was in that joke of a movie, United Passions. I wasn't too impressed by the French political comedy, The French Minister, but that's comedy, this is drama. Good choice of music for the trailer. Hoping for a nuanced look into the world of French politics and Depardieu to show his old form.

If you want dubbing, see Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon 2.0 - it has audio for Spanish, French, German and Mandarin, so English audio may be available for this."
Marseille,House of Baguettes? Can't wait. 
Marseille,"Well, I don't know how to read so those subtits are annoying."
Marseille,"Part of me wishes they has it available in English with voice overs instead of subtitles but I'll still give it a try 

Edit: I hate to complain but I really don't see how I'm down voted for giving a valid opinion. There's a reason film companies add in voice overs to movies and that House of Cards is made available in multiple languages.  "
Marseille,"Kept waiting for the punchline. What an odd day to release this trailer, especially since Netflix is known for celebrating April Fools."
Marseille,"**APRIL FOOL'S!**

*...right?*"
Marseille,is this another april fools?
Marseille,"It's not too difficult, but in my opinion its more engaging to watch a show in a language you understand. There's a reason many shows are voiced-over into other languages. "
Marseille,"I see the same thing,  all that's missing is an incurable brain disease and we have French boss. "
Marseille,Cause Gégé
Marseille,The Last Panthers?
Marseille,French films are pretty good but apart from Engrenages and Les Revenants are there any good French tv shows? Is tv in France bad?
Marseille,"It will be. There will be an audio description version. But seriously, is literacy really that big of a problem? Peripheral vision is a thing you know."
Marseille,They anounced it a couple of month before.
Teen Titans Go!,I don't care what anybody says. This show is fuckin awesome. You'll never change my mind. The musical numbers are hilarious.
Teen Titans Go!,Love the Young Justice cameo lmao. The other great clip is when they meet the previous version of themselves.
Teen Titans Go!,"Anybody who thinks this show is bad needs to watch the Thundercats episode, perfect analogy for the show in general. I don't get how people can't find that funny."
Teen Titans Go!,This show is trash.  The movie was literally the worst movie I've ever seen
Teen Titans Go!,I miss Young Justice I don't hate TTG but I am over it.
Teen Titans Go!,"That episode where Cyborg was jamming out to his tracks, I think it was called 40% 40% 20%? 

Damn, it was great."
Teen Titans Go!,I started to like it when I realized that it was essentially a kid's version of IASIP but with superheroes. Just awful people doing dumb shit to each other and the world at large.
Teen Titans Go!,"It’s also way more adult than I thought it would be. In one episode: >!In the background of the Batcave, there’s an urn that says ROBIN 2 and there’s a crowbar propped against it.!<  in another >!The rest of the team pulls an April Fools prank on Robin and tell him his family is alive.!<"
Teen Titans Go!,"The real problem was oversaturation.


It was never gonna be the reboot of the 2000s Teen Titans, and that's ok. Literally a different timeline, thanks Barry Allen. And for what it does, it does pretty well. Slapstick, a bit of satire, the occasional jab at people who didn't like it and goofy humor with a dash of action thrown in.


*But why the fuck was it covering +75% of CN's airtime???* 


I haven't had cable in about 7 years now so idk if they've moved past that, but by Chuck Norris's pube hair it was on entirely too much, outside of the annoyingly frequent marathons! They have plenty of other IPs to play, but almost everything else got stuck on Boomerang, with new series being stuck in the Dead on Arrival slots like Sonic Boom and the MegaMan series that I didn't know about until it was cancelled"
Teen Titans Go!,"I saw a few episodes, it's not too bad but Beast Boy is so weird. They feel too exaggerated now. That said, critics need to understand who the target audience is, which isn't them. It's a kid friendly reboot with meta, it's not meant to be taken that seriously and that's ok."
Teen Titans Go!,"It's a show that I can kind of get the hate for it (and was once a hater of it) because it's weird to see them take such a beloved classic and then make something completely different, but if you treat it as its own thing then it's really good."
Teen Titans Go!,Thundercats reboot got canned after like 5 episodes ironically
Teen Titans Go!,That episode is so great it has spawned multiple sequel specials and an entirely new sequel series to TTG as well.
Teen Titans Go!,"I have given this same exact analogy/whatever you want to call it before.

Literally, once they got into their groove, the vast majority of episodes is about Robin scream-lecturing the rest of the team. Robin is 100% the Dennis of TTG."
Teen Titans Go!,"> But why the fuck was it covering +75% of CN's airtime???

One would assume it gets views. Sure, I would rather see them bring back random shows from my youth that no one brings up, such as Time Squad, or Mike, Lu & Og, but it's pretty obvious this is more profitable for them."
Teen Titans Go!,"That's true but... To be fair, you can say the same about the writers as well. A lot of times it feels like they are just trying to make fun of the critics of the series and sometimes that takes priority over having good jokes.


I mean... Sometimes it feels ""wow, we are being serious badly on purpose to prove the critics they are wrong! Isn't that funny!?"". It can get old. And probably the target audience is not one that even knows about those critisms anyway."
Teen Titans Go!,If the show isn't meant to appeal to the original audience they should've just used different characters~~ Or waited a longer amount of time before rebooting it.
Teen Titans Go!,Absolutely. They're so awful that all the other team heroes hate them and they cannot do their job.
Teen Titans Go!,"In Canada the CTV Sci-Fi channel started just running marathons of Star Trek every single day, but a different Trek series for every day of the week. One day is DS9, another is VOY, another is ENT, another is TNG, another is TOS, and then the new ones air as they come out. They're sticking with it, so clearly the strategy is working well enough for them.

The Comedy channel has gotten the same way actually, it's mostly marathons of Big Bang Theory, Friends, Corner Gas and Seinfeld."
Teen Titans Go!,Well it's easy for a show to get lots of views when it's apparently the only thing airing on a network.
Teen Titans Go!,"As a fan who grew up with the original, I agree that using the same characters and designs and actors, just in a new art style, invited the comparison. I also strongly disliked the show at first. But rewatching the original, it was goofy and absurd about half the time already. So while the new show lacks the drama, it isn't as different as I remembered. Plus, in my opinion, the new show eventually got really, really funny."
Teen Titans Go!,"They said target audience, not original audience.  Here the target audience would be anyone open to parodies.  Personally I watched the older Teen Titans cartoon and liked it a lot, but I also really enjoy Go."
Teen Titans Go!,"How long is enough, in your opinion?

I'd be willing to bet you didn't even check the time between the two series, as 7 years seems plenty long to me."
Teen Titans Go!,"If it was that easy, every network would have one show. You can lead viewers to a show but you can't make them watch."
Teen Titans Go!,Teen titans go to the movies is legit funny
Teen Titans Go!,"Finally, Zack can be associated with a good DC property"
Teen Titans Go!,Teen Titans Go is STILL ON? Jesus.
Teen Titans Go!,"I like how Snyder has no problem poking fun at himself and the memes surrounding his time with DC. He seems like such a great guy, and that has nothing to do with his artistic capabilities."
Teen Titans Go!,is he gonna introduce them to Ayn Rand?
Teen Titans Go!,Oh this is really awkward timing
Teen Titans Go!,Eww.
Teen Titans Go!,I still don't understand what they did with Beast Boy in TTG...or why. I get the characters are kind of exaggerated versions but Beat Boy is acting like Friedman from The Cleveland Show and it's so jarring.
Teen Titans Go!,"I despise Zach Snyder as an artist and director, but he seems like a really great guy and very self-aware of why people don't like what he makes"
Teen Titans Go!,"""Finally: the character I needed in Teen Titans Go,"" said no one,ever."
Teen Titans Go!,Did the bots get him his audition?
Teen Titans Go!,"How is this show still going on, I swear they’re only airing this show because they know it basically zombifies children with abounding fart jokes and crude humor."
Teen Titans Go!,[deleted]
Teen Titans Go!,Eww
Teen Titans Go!,Awesome!  i love Teen Titans Go! and it will be fun to have Zack Snyder actually voicing the cartoon version of himself!
Teen Titans Go!,"""QUICK KIDS ASK YOUR PARENTS HOW BABIES ARE BORN!"""
Teen Titans Go!,I got a early screening free ticket for it. I hated the show(blamed for the cancellation of young justice and I was young and stupid). I went in with zero expectations and I ended up enjoying the movie. Great jokes and hilarious meta commentary on the DC characters
Teen Titans Go!,The whole show is legit funny.  I'll die on that hill.
Teen Titans Go!,"Funnily enough, it's probably better than most MCU films.

Wish more people watched it.

Also had one of my favourite endings in recent times, 3:20 onwards.

Teen Titans Go!,I’m in the minority but I prefer it to Deadpool…
Teen Titans Go!,"""*Aw*, they did the car before you, bro."""
Teen Titans Go!,"To be fair, he executive produced The Suicide Squad"
Teen Titans Go!,its the biggest hit the channel has had in YEARS.
Teen Titans Go!,"As a 28 year old man, I find it hilarious. Still miss OG Teen Titans, but damn, I’d much rather watch TTG than the live action Titans. Can’t believe they fucked that up as much as they have."
Teen Titans Go!,"Original Teen Titans show = 2003 - 2006.

Go = infinity.

Life's not fair."
Teen Titans Go!,"Unfortunately yes. It's a real plague on hotel TVs. I can't fucking stand it. Bring back real Teen Titans  

edit: Woof no taste in this sub confirmed"
Teen Titans Go!,Yah he seems like he has fun making films and I’m glad he was able to bounce back after his family tragedy.
Teen Titans Go!,"Yeah, he seems like a…questionable artist, but a decent dude.

I’ll also let much slide with the fucked up situation he got into while filming bvs."
Teen Titans Go!,"Not saying I necessarily believe these claims, but [this](https://www.rollingstone.com/tv-movies/tv-movie-features/justice-league-the-snyder-cut-bots-fans-1384231/amp/) article doesn’t paint Snyder in a very good light. So he may or may not be as nice as he appears behind the scenes."
Teen Titans Go!,"He *seemed* like a great guy until it was recently detailed how he likely the one who [orchestrated](https://www.rollingstone.com/tv-movies/tv-movie-features/justice-league-the-snyder-cut-bots-fans-1384231/) the online ""release the Snyder cut"" campaign."
Teen Titans Go!,I hope they point out that soldiers who have never had a no kill policy are different from characters who are supposed to be against killing no matter what.
Teen Titans Go!,"That’s not what happened, though. Also you can absolutely see how Snyder’s warped perception of reality colored his version of Superman, but if you want to make an argument for him having fascist tendencies, the more obvious examples are how he decided to portray Rorschach and all of 300."
Teen Titans Go!,FYI young justice is back and more oriented towards YA than kids now.
Teen Titans Go!,"Huh. They had Jonah Hex in there, I'm surprised."
Teen Titans Go!,"> Funnily enough, it's probably better than most MCU films.

Jesus, some people really hate the MCU"
Teen Titans Go!,"""Executive Producer"" can mean everything from ""heavily involved in the filmmaking process"" to ""we slapped this name on here for the name recognition"". I'm pretty certain that was the latter."
Teen Titans Go!,Judging by my cable guide you'd think it's the only show they've aired in years.
Teen Titans Go!,"So much so that Cartoon Network marathons it constantly, barely giving the other shows a chance to shine and thrive."
Teen Titans Go!,It’s not a hit. They just got rid of the other shows and marathoned it all day. It’s artificial promotion
Teen Titans Go!,Little kids like what little kids like. What can you do?
Teen Titans Go!,"Imo, Teen Titans Go! does what it does better than Teen Titans did what it did, if that makes sense."
Teen Titans Go!,">“Geoff and Jon are dragging their feet on taking their names off my cut. Now, I will destroy them on social media.”

You can tell Geoff Johns wrote this because the dialogue is terrible."
Teen Titans Go!,"Released the day ZSJL went digital and the only source is WB themselves, not even discovery. Whole thing gives off hit piece vibes."
Teen Titans Go!,I wish people would just read the article instead of just blindly downvoting you.
Teen Titans Go!,[deleted]
Teen Titans Go!,This story is off the rails. It paints Snyder as an absolute psychopath
Teen Titans Go!,Given that the main source for this article is the same company that screwed him over several times I'm quite uncertain on how much of this is true.
Teen Titans Go!,"The person who wrote that has been hating on Snyder for years, even trying to link him to Epstein."
Teen Titans Go!,I orchestrated the release the Snyder cut campaign lol. that article is a lie.
Teen Titans Go!,Garbage article
Teen Titans Go!,"People are really forgetting there is a classic action comics storyline where superman kills 3 of his people from an alternative dimension in order to stop them conquering the planet, as a result his guilt cause him to sleepwalk as an alternate identity vigilante called gangbusters."
Teen Titans Go!,"Falcon was always very famous for his body count and how easily he killed people in his comic books, wasn't he?"
Teen Titans Go!,"He didnt write Watchmen, David Hayter did, voice of Solid Snake in the MGS franchise and writer of X-Men 2, and Alex Tse did. And no fucking way did he write 300, that was Frank Miller. You're just like everybody else who said the same thing about Starship Troopers and Robocop. ""Starship Troopers is Verhoeven supporting Fascism, Robocop is glorifying violence"", same exact things people said about both 300 and Watchmen, which is kind of ironic that the two action directors that live irony im their movies also share the same reception to their films in two different generations. 

I gaurantee you, you can't actually point anything that supports both your claims, you'll only link some failed filmmaker YouTuber where you get all your ""own"" film criticisms and just spread them wherever you can be ause that's exactly how it's always been because you can't form your own opinion at all, none of you can, it's all the same conjecture spread for years."
Teen Titans Go!,"> the more obvious examples are how he decided to portray Rorschach and all of 300.

Snyder's Rorschach vs MCU's Falcon: who kills more people, and who appears more happy while killing people?"
Teen Titans Go!,"That show is so dense with plot, feels like an actual comic"
Teen Titans Go!,"Have you seen the movie? It's literally more interesting, funnier and with a better story than the majority of MCU films."
Teen Titans Go!,Or they were contractually bound to give him a credit.
Teen Titans Go!,"It’s the same way George Miller was an executive producer for Justice League. He did so much to try to get his version of it made and it fell through but he still legally had to have his name on it. 

So Snyder’s name will be connected to everything he had any kinda hand in on."
Teen Titans Go!,Yeah the James Gunn movie really needed help with name recognition.
Teen Titans Go!,"Yeah dude im suuuuure they burned all their scheduling time and a cinematic film budget on a show nobody was watching, especially in the era of streaming where a kid could just as easily turn the TV off and watch whatever they wanted if they didn't like what was on the TV, no no no, they did it to SPITE you for liking the OG teen titans, yeeeeah, they were picking on you.

Do yourself a favor and stop watching cartoon review channels."
Teen Titans Go!,I'm actually a fully formed adult and I love the show. It's so goddamned funny and the looks of disdain I get when I tell 27 year olds I love it are just icing on the cake.
Teen Titans Go!,"Well, I've always suggested placing children in empty wells to build character, but apparently, that's not ""morally or ethically sound""."
Teen Titans Go!,Good point. Guess I'll just go back to watching porn. I mean movies.
Teen Titans Go!,"In what way do you feel the old show fell short, out of curiosity?"
Teen Titans Go!,the article is just based off rumors and speculation
Teen Titans Go!,Yes. The article that compares Snyder to Lex Luther and describes him as some cartoon villain should be taken 100% seriously
Teen Titans Go!,Just pointing out that the entire cast of the Justice League supported Snyder and seemed to enjoy working with him.
Teen Titans Go!,"Why the hell would they want to do that to a property that made them money and revived interest in their future projects? “Yeah, our film that did much better the second time around because of this guy only did well because of an internet campaign we are now outing, not because we make good movies,” is not a good look, especially when the much more understandable response would be saying, “Wow, can we make more money on this guy, who’s clearly at least as good a promoter as he is a director?”

&#x200B;

Not to say any company, let alone Warner Brothers, is even mostly logical, but this would be taking the golden egg that fell into your lap and painting it with poop to match the walls."
Teen Titans Go!,So youre saying the character never had a no kill policy and is a soldier in these movies?
Teen Titans Go!,"We can talk all day about how the MCU chooses to portray their characters versus how Snyder does, but the definition of a fascist is not “kills people sometimes.” This is completely irrelevant to what I said in such a strange way. You have no idea what you’re talking about, do you?"
Teen Titans Go!,"> Have you seen the movie? It's literally more interesting, funnier and with a better story than the majority of MCU films.

Yes, Ive seen it. It has a few funny jokes and is a cookie cutter childrens movie aside from those. Sure, it might be better than, i dont know, ""Love&Thunder"" but thats one movie, not the majority."
Teen Titans Go!,"Considering what mostly remains of the DCEU fanbase is the Snyder cultists I would say actually yes, from their perspective it would help to slap Snyder's name on it."
Teen Titans Go!,"Remember when the original teen titans came out and all the BTAS fans were upset with how childish and anime inspired it was? With all the chibi gags and lack of batman?

Pretty funny"
Teen Titans Go!,This is literally a chicken and egg situation. The only reason it’s so popular is because they kept shoving in front of everyone’s face and cut the screen time of other shows
Teen Titans Go!,"I can’t do the show as it is just too many episodes but I do love their movies, especially teen titans vs teen titans go"
Teen Titans Go!,"Bane/Leonidas, is that you?"
Gomorra -  La serie,Where is a good place to stream this? Have heard nothing but praise and it seems to fit my taste in shows
Gomorra -  La serie,"It will hit sundance Aug 24 and im sure it will start getting more talk. http://www.sundance.tv/series/gomorrah

The thought is that they are going to make an american version of this show and let it loose...but they are keeping their feet on the neck of this show right now..so that everyone will watch the american version.

If this show were on Netflix it would most likely be the most talked about show on reddit for awhile...



"
Gomorra -  La serie,"I just started watching this, three episodes in, and I think it's promising.

It's not on the same level as the Sopranos but it's still good. "
Gomorra -  La serie,I finished season 2 last week and moved on to Romanzo Criminale this week.  Give it a try.  If you liked Gomorra you should like Romanzo as well.
Gomorra -  La serie,"I was reading a thread which said the same thing, I'll give that a try."
Gomorra -  La serie,"Everyone who loved The Wire and similar shows and hasn't seen Gomorra yet, should start watching right away."
Gomorra -  La serie,"Be sure to watch L'Immortale, which is a feature-length Ciro film that bridges seasons 4 and 5. It's like a double-length episode of Gomorrah."
Gomorra -  La serie,"Oh i didnt know its going to have another season but damn, never enough of Gomorra!"
Gomorra -  La serie,I'll do you one better: why is Gamorra?
Gomorra -  La serie,"Tremendous show, did not even see the finale season coming but binged watched the 4 seasons once more a month ago, so perfect timing!

The atmosphere they manage to share every episode is quite unique, i could only recommend people to watch it!"
Gomorra -  La serie,Had no idea it was continuing!
Gomorra -  La serie,Is Ciro still alive?
Gomorra -  La serie,Where is Thanos?
Gomorra -  La serie,Think Nebula will make an appearance?
Gomorra -  La serie,Cannot wait!!!
Gomorra -  La serie,On my watchlist..always hearing good things about this.
Gomorra -  La serie,The is a FIVE!?
Gomorra -  La serie,"Yeah, this is gonna be the final season."
Gomorra -  La serie,Watch L'Immortale.
Gomorra -  La serie,"Damn would've been funny to see an HBO series named ""Showtime""!"
Gomorra -  La serie,Sucks that Bo Burnham dropped out as Larry Bird but I'm looking forward to this.
Gomorra -  La serie,Apparently this show is what broke up Adam McKay and Will Ferrell. Ferrell wanted to play Jerry Buss but McKay didn't think he could do a more dramatic role so he cast John C. Reilly instead. Now they don't work together anymore and we'll never get Step Brothers 2 :(
Gomorra -  La serie,"""Winning Time"" was already the name of the 30 for 30 documentary about Reggie Miller and the New York Knicks in the 90s"
Gomorra -  La serie,Why not call it The Lakeshow
Gomorra -  La serie,"Hope they show how this team influenced the team oriented style bball we've seen from the current Warriors, 2000s Spurs and 2000s Suns"
Gomorra -  La serie,"I hope they get Bill Burr to do a bit part in this.  Being a famous Celtics fan, he'd be eager for it. I loved his little roles in Mandalorian and Reservation Dogs."
Gomorra -  La serie,"Really looking forward to this show, the cast is insanely promising! I hope McKay - Ferrell break up won't effect it badly tho."
Gomorra -  La serie,bad title
Gomorra -  La serie,Love itttt - Pat Riley's gonna have to be a scene-stealer lol
Gomorra -  La serie,"As much as it pains me to say this as growing up during the bulls run in the 1990’s, the only true dynasty in the NBA was Bill Russell’s Celtics. 
11 championships, twice as much as the 1980s lakers, and just under 2x the 1990s bulls."
Gomorra -  La serie,That would have really been amazing
Gomorra -  La serie,"Shit, he did? I was so excited for that"
Gomorra -  La serie,What the hell? That’s literally perfect casting
Gomorra -  La serie,Did they ever say who would replace him? I thought he would’ve done a great job
Gomorra -  La serie,"It's actually a little worse than that. Ferrell was cast as Buss, McKay didn't think he could do it, and went behind his back to cast Reilly instead. Ferrell had to hear about it from Reilly."
Gomorra -  La serie,After seeing Ferrell in a semi-dramatic role on The Shrink Next Door I can easily see him being able to do a dramatic role. He's pretty good in it
Gomorra -  La serie,Will Ferrell can do more dramatic roles! Have you seen the 2006 movie Stranger than Fiction? Or the 2010 movie “Everything Must Go”?
Gomorra -  La serie,"> we'll never get Step Brothers 2

If *Dumb and Dumber 2*, *Anchorman 2*, *Zoolander 2*, *Coming to America 2*, *Borat 2* or *Ghostbusters 2016*/ *Ghostbusters: Afterlife* are any indication, we dodged a bullet there. Comedy sequels rarely work, and doing one decades after the first is basically a guarantee it will be a steaming pile of shit"
Gomorra -  La serie,We don’t need stepbrothers 2
Gomorra -  La serie,"Ferrell's banner with McKay (Gary Sanchez) are producing McKay's next work ""Bad Blood"" about the Theranos founder, so it seems they're at least semi-amicable. [[Source](https://screenrant.com/bad-blood-movie-jennifer-lawrence-theranos-apple-tv/)]"

Gomorra -  La serie,Why not call it Showtime? We could have HBO’s Showtime or Showtime on HBO!
Gomorra -  La serie,That sort of thing isn't really in the scope of this sort of drama beyond maybe like a bit at the end credits.
Gomorra -  La serie,6 titles in 8 years is absolutely a dynasty.
Gomorra -  La serie,Imagine gatekeeping dynasties 😂
Gomorra -  La serie,"I wouldn’t say that. It’s different eras. If the biggest  run in the last 50 years was 6 out of 8, then that has to be somewhat the standard for dynasty. 

It’s like in football, pre SB 5 championships was a dynasty. Then 4. Then the salary cap happened and now 3 out of 4 can be considered a dynasty"
Gomorra -  La serie,Scheduling unfortunately.
Gomorra -  La serie,[deleted]
Gomorra -  La serie,"I remember that, it was after he woke up from his coma and Reilly had married his wife and couldn't figure out how to have the TV and stereo on at the same time."
Gomorra -  La serie,It sucks that Ferrell is pigeonholed like that as an actor even by one of his closest friends/partners. He's shown that he can do some dramatic work in the past and so far he's been really good in The Shrink Next Door.
Gomorra -  La serie,I’ve heard a few stories that Adam McKay is a shitty person.
Gomorra -  La serie,Anchorman 2 was pretty decent in my opinion
Gomorra -  La serie,"I mean, Anchorman 2 is the only one of those McKay and Ferrell did and it's probably the best of that lot, so I feel validated."
Gomorra -  La serie,Yes we do.
Gomorra -  La serie,Probably an old deal. They're literally not on speaking terms according to McKay.
Gomorra -  La serie,He's not going anywhere though?
Gomorra -  La serie,"First of all, you're not my real dad.

Secondly, McKay said all of this himself."
Gomorra -  La serie,Not compared to 11 in 13
Gomorra -  La serie,"I always wonder how often ""scheduling"" is the go to excuse for something else. I'm sure sometimes it's the case but not as often as is said. 

Regardless I'll see whatever Bo works on next. Haven't been disappointed by a single thing he's done"
Gomorra -  La serie,"Reilly comes out of the situation looking pretty good tho tbh. Got the role, and was a good enough friend to talk to will about it."
Gomorra -  La serie,It is wrong on several ways because McKay primed Ferrell telling the story maybe Will just want to bury the issue but the press will go back to him to ask about his side. And I doubt only Ferrell's friend could play that role.
Gomorra -  La serie,Why would he want the tv and stereo on at the same time?
Gomorra -  La serie,Both Ferrell and Paul Rudd have been amazing in that miniseries. One of my favorite miniseries of the year.
Gomorra -  La serie,"It would be nothing but disappointment. What’s the story there? It works so well because of how leftfield it is. A sequel years later won’t have any of that, and it’ll just be forced."
Gomorra -  La serie,Yes read that article last week as well. This was announced yesterday. May be an old deal but can't imagine they'd move forward if not speaking.
Gomorra -  La serie,[deleted]
Gomorra -  La serie,They are both dynasties. Also there were 8 teams in the league during those Celtics years. The 90’s Bulls would 100% destroy those Celtics.
Gomorra -  La serie,"There were only 8 teams in the league for most of their early championships, early Celtics championships are a joke."
Gomorra -  La serie,"Usually scheduling issues is just that. Scheduling issues are rampant with film and especially tv production.

Creative differences is when there’s hidden drama"
Gomorra -  La serie,Bringo

Gomorra -  La serie,"The distribution deal was just announced.

The article says Ferrell is producing through Gary Sanchez, which was dissolved in 2019 when he and McKay opened their own separate production companies. Any projects still in the works under Gary Sanchez are just deals they made before that. Like how Will Ferrell produces Succession, it's in name only.

Gomorra -  La serie,Why are you even commenting.
Gomorra -  La serie,Then why are you even here?
Gomorra -  La serie,"Hes literally the guy who did what the story is about. It's not gossip, its autobiographical."
Gomorra -  La serie,"Depends on the rules honestly. A lot of the Air Jordan stuff would get heavily punished in the 60’s. Likewise a lot of the 60’s teams would lack the scoring firepower to compete in the 90’s. 

People forget that back then the league mate rules to make Wilt less dominant. When Jordan played, the league wanted that emulated more and did more to make that style more accessible."
Gomorra -  La serie,"Okay…? That means all the best players were only divided by 8 teams. There weren’t truly trash teams in the league with no talent the way there are today. 

Like let’s be real, the 90’s weren’t a very competitive era. Jordan didn’t start winning until the Lakers, Pistons and Celtics got way too old and nobody really replaced them. Then their dynasty ended before the Kobe/Shaq Lakers and Spurs rose to dominance"

You don’t have insider knowledge of Hollywood. You just reflexively downvote people you don’t like. 

What a horseshit example you set for this sub."
Gomorra -  La serie,"The irony of you calling me a snowflake when you're whining about being downvoted (when you were clearly wrong about something easily verifiable and tripled down instead of just doing the adult thing and admitting you were wrong). Not only that but you're so mad you're looking at my profile and attacking me personally lmao. One of your comments is sitting at -17. Do you think I logged into a dozen different alts to downvote you or something? You don't know whether or not I have insider knowledge, but what I do have is basic reading comprehension skills and the ability to google. Just admit you were wrong."
Gomorra -  La serie,"Oh my god. What a psycho. LMAO

This has nothing to do with who produced what show. It has to do with you IMMEDIATELY downvoting people you disagree with like a petulant child. Never once did I downvote you just because you come across like a complete tool. Nor did I accuse you of having a dozen accounts. Please remind me where I did that. 

It has to do with you acting like a baby and being a dogshit ambassador of this sub."

Gomorra -  La serie,"So here's my question. Eve loses her ring, and Gavin later discovers it after digging a fairly shallow hole. Wouldn't there be cars and pieces of buildings like the art gallery buried just below the surface all over LA? The area would've been an archaeological wonder long before the city was built there."
Gomorra -  La serie,This legitimately looks like one of those Lost clones from like 2005 somehow ended up coming out in 2021
Gomorra -  La serie,"Man, every network has been trying to capture the same magic as Lost since 2004 and most have been misses."
Gomorra -  La serie,"It was basically Lost, but without the great characters, great acting, suspense, interesting mysteries and surprising twists. 

Oh well. Lost was lightning in a bottle. They'll never recreate that. But this was fun enough that I'll keep watching."
Gomorra -  La serie,"It's real bad. Mediocre CGI, terrible cast full of people who jump from cancelled show to cancelled show on broadcast, really feels like a 2012 LOST ripoff, one episode in and we already have ridiculous subplots including a rogue cop who steals energy bars (?) and a car packed with heroin (???). Like who gives a shit about any of this lol. 

It's a huge trainwreck. I can't wait for more."
Gomorra -  La serie,"The stereotypical high dude makes a joke about them being stuck in an episode of Lost. Not an issue on its own, but they know exactly what they are doing.

That heroin subplot is just out of nowhere and obviously is going to become part of some plot that shouldn't matter after you fell into another dimension. Also no reason to assume the owner of the car is down there too, but they do.

Those wolves were pretty bad. Tiger was bad. Somehow these people are capable of outrunning both of them.

The dad is getting visions for...reasons. And somehow comes to the conclusion that he could find something buried, which would only happen if he knew they were in the past. But there is nothing leading up to that. He's just like, I thought I could find a sign if I dig at this rock. 

The military using a Logitech Extreme 3D Pro to fly a drone. Literally didn't paint it, or do anything with it. Just a joystick tilting off the table while she uses it. I don't know, it's only a few seconds in a scene, but still pretty low effort.

The show is obviously going to be super tropey. I'm still going to give it a shot because I like the general concept. It's definitely going to get cancelled though."
Gomorra -  La serie,"None of these characters seem compelling.  Some of the casting doesn't seem to help. None of the actors have ""it"".  But the premise is intriguing enough to stick with after the pilot.  Taking it one episode at a time."
Gomorra -  La serie,"The pilot was not really impressive. Not very good acting for the most part and cgi was really bad....

Another lost wannabe but i dont think it will last..."
Gomorra -  La serie,Who the hell is funding these 😂
Gomorra -  La serie,The CGI made that Walking Dead deer look amazing.
Gomorra -  La serie,I did not watch it but I'm reading these comments and dying laughing. I really hope someone creates a sub for their show and I will read the comments religiously
Gomorra -  La serie,I've watched and thoroughly enjoyed some truly garbage TV in my time. But this is the kind of shit that makes you lose your faith in humanity. It was an absolute Herculean feat of willpower to not just turn this off and do something more entertaining like cleaning the bathroom.
Creators,"I don’t really care either way, but it’s really bizarre that Joel and Ellie come across, I think, 0 infected after KC."
Creators,They didn't need tons of infected just a spattering like when Ellie meets David. I feel like that whole interaction would have been better if there was some infected so it's more of a trusting moment for her like in the game
Creators,[removed]
Creators,[removed]
Creators," I missed Ellie fighting infected with David. It made more sense in the game that he wanted to “partner” with her after seeing how useful she was. In the show it felt like we skipped a beat and his fascination with her felt less earned.

The other action sequence I missed was the fight/escape at the university. It didn’t need to be as big as in the game and Joel could still get stabbed by a bat but I missed the suspense of Joel hobbling out as Ellie has to be the protector for the first time. Felt rushed in the show."
Creators,They got it backwards. Infected are way more critical to the first story than the second.
Creators,"I get where they are coming from but I think they overcorrected to the point where you're questioning why a vaccine is needed.

The series is probably 1-2 episodes light."
Creators,The real issue is it only being 9 episodes. 2 of those episodes were back stories and the rest had to also build up other characters.
Creators,"I do think there should have been more. The story is of course about the characters, and their relationships... But the infected felt completely shunted to the side in the second half of the story. Joel and Ellie run into, what, 1 after Sam? There are opportunities to make them more influential. You don't have to cut every single action sequence."
Creators,"It's so weird that people see this argument as binary.

Either ""the story isn't about the infected! it's about J and E and their relationship! more would ruin it!"" or ""there was no infected at all! total lack of action! so boring!""

There's a fucking middle ground, people. They could totally have added *some* more infected without killing the story, without making people bored of the violence. No one is asking for 30 minutes of non-stop infected killing every episode. No one wants TWD again. But yes, a *little* more of infected would have been great, and I look forward to a *little* more of them in season 2."
Creators,"I definitely think 9 episodes was way too short, and am surprised that they didn’t at least go to say, 12 episodes, to flesh out some of the conflicts and characters. But, maybe that’s all that was greenlit and now they are going to get way more leeway to stretch things out and give some storylines some air. Here’s hoping at least."
Creators,It did feel like they stripped a little too much from the game
Creators,Rat King is coming
Creators,"There were two weird uses of the Infected. 1) that the world wide cordyceps web never came back beyond the episode it was referenced in feels like a miss, and 2) the Tress death kiss is still super weird

Other than that, I don’t think it was over or under done. There was a whole scene where the earth opened and a Belcher showed up"
Creators,Translation: “The Last of Us” will have a shitload more money in the budget for effects.
Creators,Balance fixes for next patch. Nice!
Creators,Epic series. They need to turn it into a video game.
Creators,"It was a serious flaw for me. The story starts on top of a serious,cataclysmic threat and sticks to it for 2 episodes. We see infected again once after that. It's a great story but they travel around freely never having to deal with infected again. Ellie's importance fades. I watched the middle episodes thinking ""oh shit!! they're going to have to enter the buildings"" but no infected anywhere. They have to use the tunnels, no infected, they travel through forests, no infected. They travel to a university then to an empty town and enter a home with no infected anywhere again. The last batch of episodes I basically told myself the infected aren't a danger I guess. I dont see it as a necessity to have the story we got. It's still top tier TV but the show kinda shifts into a generic post apocalypse rather than the world it started off as. Games need high numbers of encounters to keep engagement but this goes hard the opposite direction."
Creators,"Its weird. The show has really driven home to me how little the infected actually have to do with the plot, but still their absence makes them feel like less a part of traversing the world. I didn’t mind them not being around much, I expected it, but it almost seems backwards to commit to more of them in season 2 by when there’ll be Scars and the WLF to represent now as well."
Creators,"For me, without infected the relationship between Joel and Ellie fell a little flat because their bond felt somewhat unearned. In the game they are pushed to the limits and that experience makes their bond so much stronger. So maybe an episode or two were missing with more action between them and infected."
Creators,It's a good show but it just feels like blander more watered down version of the game. The show is just missing that constant tension and feeling that anything could happen at any time.
Creators,"The show is probably one of the greatest game adaptations ever. It's amazing how similar they kept a lot of set pieces and dialog. Amazing work.

However, as a show, it's really not that compelling and very boring. You miss out on a lot of key moments and growth between characters because the story moves at a quick pace. The episode where Ellie meets David would have been much better if they included them fighting the infected together. Stuff like that is missing greatly."
Creators,They are blazing through the story and skipping all the big action sequences.
Creators,"I mostly enjoyed the show but I would say pacing and choosing which storylines to focus on more, was the biggest issue of season 1. Also the finale was a bit short and disappointing, ngl"
Creators,"This show has been so strange to me! I loved Last of Us the game... and I love the show... but it feels like they should have had 3 more episodes. The story beats were there but it felt kind of forced, the father/daughter relationship between Joel and Ellie. Like we didn't get enough time with them to develop that relationship in the show with all the side stories (episode 3 is an absolute masterpiece in storytelling). I haven't watched the final episode yet but I dunno... 12 episodes would have been great."
Creators,[removed]
Creators,The lack of action started in episode 3
Creators,The monkey paw curls and turns S2 into one of the Resident Evil movies.
Creators,When I hear a great show is making changes to address fans' concerns I just assume it's about to get significantly worse and so far I've been right every time
Creators,"How will all the defenders constantly screaming ""its not about infected! Duh!"" be able to say that after every episode now?!"
Creators,With how little the infected were shown I almost forgot they existed.
Creators,"Too late, you already skipped all the good stuff"
Creators,Season 1 treated the game as if it were a walking simulator. It was such a bizarre choice.
Creators,"Yeah i got bored tbh it was like- Meet new characters, they die. Repeat. 🤣"
Creators,My wife and I just watched ep 6 and she said she didn't like the last 2 episodes cause they have almost no action. This is a woman that closes heir eyes in every gore scene on any movie/show.
Creators,"It felt like an adventure of the week buddy cop show. It was fun to look into this world a little more, but as far as overarching risk within the plot it really didn’t feel like there was any…"
Creators,"I really did not like the infected in the finale, it highlights the problem they are trying to avoid

Because of the needs of the scene, the infected just runs up and kind of pins the person and makes noises in front of them while suspense builds

After the suspense is allowed to build for a little bit, the person somehow manages to get the thing off of them.  Usually they manage to reach a nearby weapon.

Then, even though the infected just did it's whole ""pin them and make scary noises"" routine, somehow a bite mark appears on the person's leg.  Darn, now they are infected.

/yawn"
Creators,The show felt incredibly hollow to me.
Creators,"I liked the Bill and Frank episode, and the explanations for the origin of of cordyceps and Ellie's immunity. But overall the show just wasn't as good as the game. I think it needed more time maybe idk. I wasn't quite buying the relationship, especially at the end."
Creators,Oh something tells me they're will be something else that will be complained about in S2
Creators,"I'm two minds about it.

At first I was really enjoying the fact that the zombie apocalypse in LOU was just the setting, just the catalyst for human stories. I'm not big fan of body horror and gruesome death, like you see all the time in Walking Dead. Walking Dead also seems to ask the question ""how can we have the protagonists fight more zombies?"" while LOU asks ""what adventures could the protagonists experience in a zombie-ridden world"".

What also made me double-down on this opinion were the zombie episodes of this show - the second episode and the second Kansas episode. The zombie portions were really clichéd and gamey. Seriously, in the second episode, once they entered the building you could re-construct the following story from zombie clichés. Zombies hiding in a seemingly empty building? Check. Building falling apart exactly when the protagonists enter the building? Check. Debris falling right behind the protagonists, blocking their way back? Check. Zombies resistant to bullets? Check. Hasty, nervous reloading? Check. Protagonist trying to be silent and stepping on something loud? Check. One of the protagonists getting bitten but hiding this fact? Check... And the the body horror / zombie kiss that was made just to shock the audience...

And the zombie portion of the second Kansas episode was kinda short to be full of clichés, but it felt like a video game. A boss fight while Joel is suddenly a perfect sniper (after missing the truck several times a few minutes earlier)? C'mon, that was outright lazy. All in all, I find the zombie bits of the show to be the worse parts (with the exception of the mall episode, which was really boring and dragged-out).

But that being said, the show sometimes goes too far and forgets about the zombies completely. I don't want more zombie fights (especially given how sub-par this show handles them), but I want more reminders that this is a zombie apocalypse. We have had many sight of ruined, destroyed and desolate world... but almost every time without zombies. As a big Fallout fan my default impression from these sights and stories is that it's an aftermath of some war. Why couldn't they show some zombies walking around there?

Big offenders in this regard were the 8th and 6th episodes. Both were completely lacking any zombies and 8th episode didn't even mention them. Don't get me wrong, both were probable the best episodes in this show, but they could have been part of ANY post-apocalyptic show. Seriously, in episode 8 I completely forgot about the zombies until Ellie started screaming ""I'm infected"" in the climax... and I remembered that zombies are actually a thing in this universe. In was kinda jarring.

That is probably mi biggest criticism of the show. It has some great production value, great stories and great characters... but it doesn't build the world particularly well and the main narrative is disjointed. Like, twice in 9 episodes we jumped to a flashback for 90% of the episode. First flashback was a great story, but did nothing for the overarching narrative. The second flashback served to enhance Ellie's backstory... but it was boring as hell. And the whole narrative and the worldbuilding seems to be undecisive about how important and threatening are the zombies."
Creators,Im not sure those that havent played the game will be ready for the season two though. It will be quite a big departure from season one. Im more interested whether they will announce TLOU3 soon after this as the source material had finished.
Creators,"It’s not lack of action, just lack of actual zombies. The show is good, it got me hooked. But there is a lack of zombies."
Creators,Hopefully it does. I loved both games and the show but the lack of infected was just a bad idea. They are the *reason* the world is in the state it's in. There didn't need to be walking dead level of monsters but God damn there needed to be alot more than we got
Creators,"Honestly, i thought they sprinkled in action well enough. I really don’t care for excessive gun shots and screaming. Would’ve likes the bloater to be more of a problem than it was.

Hopefully they do the Rat King well."
Creators,Is anyone gonna care about infected when we get round 2 of everyone being pissed off by *you know what*?
Creators,I don’t know maybe it’s because I  didn’t play the video games but I didn’t have a lot of the issues that people in this thread have 🤷🏾‍♂️. Are there parts I thought could have been done better? Certainly but I could say that about any show that I’ve watched. I don’t think this is #1 greatest show of all time or anything like that but that’s a huge weight to put on any show especially one in its first season. Right now I think it’s pretty great with potential to get better adaption purists be damned.
Creators,"The truth is episode 3 needed to be cut and that 1 hr 20 mins of time desperately was needed in other places, including Joel and Ellie having more encounters with infected.

Episode 3 is great tv don’t get me wrong it’s just very irrelevant to the story being told which becomes a problem when we run out of episodes telling that story"
Creators,"I'm sitting here shouting to them not to listen to the criticism like Cooper in the tesseract in Interstellar.

I worry they'll over-correct. 

In the show, these things are so damn dangerous that if they show fights with them more than a few times a season, it will quickly feel like TWD where there are no stakes whatsoever and the zombies can be dispatched with such ease that you wonder why society ever fell. 

So I'd rather have too few than too many. Personally."
Creators,"I, for one, have thoroughly enjoyed the overarching threat of infected with a lack of their constant appearance. The same goes for the need to show gore. How they showed Ellie >!killing David!<…Hitchcock would’ve been proud."
Creators,[deleted]
Creators,"When the whole hubbub came out of episode 3, as one of ""the greatest episode in television history"", in the grand scheme for overall series progression and impact to the story of Ellie and Joel, in my opinion it was a wasted episode that could have been dedicated to more infected action, tension, or mcguffin chasing."
Creators,The real monsters were the uninfected.
Creators,"Not what I expected going in. Not my thing, I expected way more action. I’m assuming most people who liked it didn’t play the game."
Creators,"I believe no spores and lack of infected hugely decreased the gravity of the situation. 

We see pockets of people living in gated communities and surviving. They die of starvation, lack of medicine, raids etc. rather than the infected. So why would we need a vaccine? Just don't venture to deep or beyond.

I mean it doesn't have to be action scenes. Seeing infected and changing their road, seeing other people getting killed could have been enough ro remind us what's at stake."
Creators,"That’s super disappointing fr.  The show is so awesome bc it is the story of the people in this crazy situation, less to do with the situation itself.  Making it all about the infected seems like it’ll ruin why the show is so great"
Creators,Who’s complaining about the lovely personal stories?
Creators,My biggest complaint is pacing. In the game we spent so much extra time traveling and having personal moments along with some serious action beats. Felt like it needed 1 or 2 extra episode of peril / personal moments in there. Hell the college piece in the game was such a big part of the story in the game and yet in the show Joel just gets stabbed and that’s it.
Creators,"I don’t want “a lot more infected” I just want enough to make them feel like a threat, to remind the audience why the world fell apart. Obviously you cannot recreate gameplay where your character is an all powerful god compared to everyone around them, where Joel kills dozens of infected at a time in a TV show, but there needed to be more threat…weather it was action packed with a few infected or stealthily getting past a bunch, they should have been there

Edit: This isn’t to say I didn’t love the show, it’s an amazing adaptation, but it’s fair to criticize things we love and want better even if it is good!"
Creators,Naw fam they fucked up the finale. I won't be back. Walking Dead it is...
Creators,"I'm cool with the amount of infected in the first season, but it wouldn't have hurt to sprinkle more in here and there.  They're there to keep you busy as you go from location to location in the game.  They're there to pad the length of the game... and I don't mean that in a bad way, it's just that it's usually the point of a video game and people want 10+ hours of it for their money, so you have to devise an excuse to have that much gameplay through plot.  This is a TV show and there is no gameplay.  I'd have liked to see *something* out there in all of those rural areas they go through.  Maybe not big fights but there's really no random infected just walking around out there?  Episode 3 shows a glimpse of a random loner infected that walks into one of Bill's traps, and the one buried under rubble, but that idea isn't really visited again and it's like they don't exist at all outside of cities."
Creators,"It definitely felt a bit too fast paced. Other shows drag on and barely move each episode while here we have one that moves a bit too fast. I still really enjoyed it though and looking forward to season 2.

Also the game coming out on PC, I've never played the game. Looking forward to experiencing it all."
Creators,"I’m happy with the lack only because I really like what they are doing with the rest of the story and killing zombies has been done to fucking death.

Also it allows my wife to watch most of it with me which is nice."
Creators,I gave up watching this BORING zombie show without zombies……..
Creators,Please don't do the same thing the walking dead did. Where the zombies took a backseat because they want to show that other humans are the real monsters
Creators,...now that the initial hype is gone ...
Creators,"The show did something the game failed miserably at, i dont even care if joel dies."
Creators,The hype on this show is odd because it's no different to others of this genre. It's the same characters over and over
Creators,"I’m glad it didn’t do like the Walking Dead did which was put in zombie kills for the sake of the Talking Dead’s bit after the show.  

There’s plenty of time for it.  And do it with style and substance.  Not belligerently."
Creators,"This makes me sad because that's what audiences did to The Walking Dead, complained about everything until they had to put a huge zombie fight into every episode until it got so repetitive the story fell apart.  This show ISN'T ABOUT THE INFECTED!  Shows like this never are.  It's about Joel and Ellie's relationship."
Creators,It was like war. Mostly boredom followed by terror for a few minutes.
Creators,I look forward to the complaints that there’s too much action
Creators,"Why does this sound like it’s gonna turn into Aliens? 

Ellie: We'd better get back 'cause it'll be dark soon and they mostly come at night. Mostly."
Creators,We gonna get the rat king.
Creators,"Frankly, the fact that it wasn’t just another zombie show was one of the best things about it."
Creators,Lack of action made it good. Dont sell out to overmedicated producers!
Creators,Finally some less circle jerky takes than the main sub.
Creators,"I don't even think the show needed any more action at all particularly.

But it is weird we only saw clickers what...2 or 3 times? 

That's literally my only gripe, I didn't think the pacing was poor or anything. Didn't even need an action sequence, but just some reminder that they exist."
Creators,"I was expecting one more big infected scene somewhere toward the end of the season, but the more I think about it the harder time I have pinpointing where it could have gone that would have been believable and moved the plot forward. Somewhere mid season I started to think we'd see one in episode 7 with Riley, but when I watched it I realized it would not have been believable for Ellie to survive a full on hoard even with Riley and some pipe bombs. Plus it emphasizes just how intense the threat is that they could barely take down one together and they still both got bit. I think the only place it might have worked would be to have kept the sequence with David in, but then I question the plausibility of that group he's amassed being that large and surviving in the area when they are largely women and children and so hungry that they are eating their own dead. Plus, if it's a small encounter it is basically repeating the same relationship building experience of the museum encounter with Joel. Probably could have worked but it wouldn't have been big enough to meet the bar for emphasizing the larger threat and I don't know how much it would have added."
Creators,"I preferred the lack of ""zombies."" It makes this series about the humans and not just another Walking Dead."
Creators,"I think they missed the perfect middle ground that a 10 episode season would have given. Personally, stretching out the university scene would have made the rest of the show that much more impactful ie. having Joel still interact and kill the man from David's group and still having him get stabbed, then having Ellie fight through the horde with an injured Joel.

Also, the infected fight with Ellie and David I believe would have greatly solidified not only the viewer's initial trust in David, but also would help ""earn"" a reason for David to take such a liking to Ellie. The rest could have been the same. 

I am beyond excited that we even got a show this fucking good based on a game I know we all love, but there is undoubtably quite a bit of missed opportunity with a few rushed scenarios."
Creators,"Some stalkers in an office building with the lights off would have been cool, we’ll probably see some in the next season."
Creators,Personally I find the zombie stuff to be the least compelling part of the show.  I think it got the the appropriate amount of story time.  Endless zombie battles are mind numbingly dull.
Creators,[removed]
Creators,[removed]
Creators,"I feel like the lack of infected was warranted IMO. Other than the opening scene, the whole thing takes place 20 years after the initial outbreak. Humanity has learned to adapt and deal with the infected. It would almost take me out of it to see humanity still having to CONSTANTLY fight off waves of zombies 20 years later. That makes sense from a game play perspective but not so much from a narrative one. On top of that, the whole point of the show is to show how shitty people have become as a result of all of this. The show that people want with lots of infected and fighting the infected would need to take place in the months after the initial outbreak, not 20 years later. I think the show made a lot of good decisions in their direction."
Creators,"My only major complaint about season 1 is the lack of infected. They got so many iconic moments spot on, but cut so many iconic infected scenes. So I'm happy to hear that this will change moving forward. 

I get it, they don't want to just throw in action for the sake of action, but I wonder if they went too far the other way to try and create distance from the label of being a game story."
Creators,A lot more… considering we have been seeing zero infected in the last episodes.. 1 infected is way more.
Creators,Yeah like the impression I got was that infected quite literally don’t exist in the cold or outside of cities. So why doesn’t everyone just fuck off to the woods then? Made the hard push for the cure seem a bit pointless.
Creators,"Meh, I have had my fill with actual zombies over the past 10 years of our noses being rubbed in them. I want a compelling story - which we 100% got with the first season here. Incredible show!"
Creators,"Yeah I can see why they had to shorten the season.

There were only 3 or 4 memorable episodes at the most.

It was a great effort, but not a series I'd watch again."
Creators,"People will always complain. There was zombie action when there needed to be, and they told a perfect story. It's one of the best adaptations I've ever seen. There are plenty of shows and movies out there if you need your gratuitous zombie violence fix that don't have the depth of this show"
Creators,Part of what is so enjoyable is the episodes where you almost forget there are infected. Getting so involved in the characters arc and then being reminded “oh yeah the worlds over run by fast mushroom zombies” is what made it work in my opinion.
Creators,"Coming from someone who did not play the games, I didn’t mind the lack of infected. I think a major theme of the show for me was that humanity were the true monsters, and focusing on those human elements was awesome."
Creators,"Only real complaint I have is for all the shows that exist with 20+ episodes per season, is that this easily could have been at least 11 episodes. Loved it regardless, just wish it lasted a little longer. 3, 5, 8 and I stand by it. Great adaptation. Can’t wait for season 2 & 3 playing Part 2 on PS5 3rd time right meow"
Creators, It was the most boring season of television that I had been looking forward to. Show sucks so much. Just kill all the characters already I don’t care.
Creators,"Lol… I mean, the zombies were literally the only interesting part of the show, the ONLY new concept to an otherwise extremely generic plot and… they just sort of neutered them. 

Frankly the damage is done. I don’t care about season 2. This show was like every single other apocalypse dystopia movie ever. I was getting deja vu. Throwing some zombies into an otherwise boring, repetitive, and depressing plot is not going to fix anything in season 2. Just another “people are the real monsters” story trying to pretend it’s deep

People have said this game has like, one of the best stories in gaming history… umm… glad I never played it since that was obviously a lie"
Creators,"I found the makeup for the infected to be very unconvincing and not particularly scary. In the few scenes of infected, especially the one where Ellie stabs the infected in the basement, it just looked like some dude in crappy makeup. I'm glad there was so few infected in the first season. I also don't know why they are promising more infected for season 2 when the second in the series of video games was much less about infected."
Creators,And more golfing
Creators,I’m just saying. The walking dead used infected as a crutch during the boring shit and this show didn’t have that issue.
Danger Mouse,"PopArena has made some AMAZING discoveries in the process of making this series, finding footage of shows lost for 4 decades. If I wasn't a broke joke he'd be amongst my first Patreon subscriptions with Babish."
Danger Mouse,Thank you for this!   I subscribed.  My husband was a producer at Nickelodeon in the late nineties and early aughts and he will love this!
Danger Mouse,Steve reviews will also be a good channel if you appreciate cartoons from the past.
Danger Mouse,"PopArena is a fantastic channel - worth your sub and if you can afford a couple bucks, a Patreon backing."
Danger Mouse,I need to see this!
Danger Mouse,"Being a Brit who grew up on Danger Mouse 80s, the word ""Nickelodeon show"" being associated with it brings me out in irrational rage."
Danger Mouse,"Haha i'm with ya man - i'm a guy who has the classic bomb with lit fuse tattooed on his arm, the tattooist even borrowed my box set of original DM that I had bought in for art reference."
Danger Mouse,"David Jason not on voice...he ain't dead and he's still working.  :-(

"
Danger Mouse,This was my favorite show as a kid.......I even named my hamster Penfold
Danger Mouse,"Can't wait to see John Oliver, Lena Headey and Stephen Fry"
Danger Mouse,"The animation is way too clean and stiff. I really miss the organic look of older cartoons. Computers just take the life away from them. And that's not nostalgia messing with me, that's the damn truth. "
Danger Mouse,"OMG. Im guessing all the 'soul' of the original show will have been sucked dry by todays TV concept writers.

DM had slow moments, just dialogue, of sheer comedy class from David Jason. Im going out on a limb and predicting this will just be an all-out action fest, no heart."
Danger Mouse,This has John Oliver in it too.
Danger Mouse,"This should be the theme music
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAO8vxWn850"
Danger Mouse,With this one it's particularly bad because the original cartoon is noteworthy for how lazy the animators were.
Danger Mouse,"It's on CBBC, so I'm guessing the primary audience is kids, and they wouldn't have any nostalgia from the 'organic' look"
Danger Mouse,"Always assume a rehash like this will be a soul-sucking piece of shit that pays homage to the original only on the very surface layers, then you won't be disappointed, as it seems like we might be from this."
Danger Mouse,No it really shouldn't. That drum beat is way off. Terrible. 
Danger Mouse,"Calling them lazy is harsh, the budget was microscopic, the reason half of the episodes ended up at the north pole was because the white background didn't need painting!"
Danger Mouse,I know. Hanna Barbera was well known fot it's time and money saving animation methods yet they had more life than this. The lines are just too thick and square. 
Danger Mouse,"But it's not just nostalgia. It just looks boring and uninteresting. I know, it is targeted to kids, who'd watch anything, but it just annoys me how lazy the animation and character design looks. "
Danger Mouse,what
Danger Mouse,"If that had happened, than it certainly would have happened, that's for sure"
Danger Mouse,Are you one of those people that makes fantasy logo compilations on YouTube?
Danger Mouse,No. Just wondering and thinking
Danger Mouse,"I'm honestly not sure whether Danger Mouse was actually any good, or if it's just something I have warm and fuzzy feelings about because I liked the explodey bomb thing when I was a little kid. "
Danger Mouse,"So this is the recent reboot that was airing on (I think) CBBC? Watched a couple episodes with my little sister and thought it was decent, will give it another try on Netflix for sure. The voice acting is all great and perfectly cast. "
Danger Mouse,"Danger Mouse always felt like a sort of.. very polite british proto Aqua Teen Hunger Force. 

In that the pitch is its this Action Spy Thriller stuff except it's mostly DM and Penngrove not actually accomplishing a whole lot while this week's antagonist bemoans something entirely tangential to the actual scheme they've concocted. Then it's somehow foiled in the last 3 minutes or so with a quick explanation to the chief. "
Danger Mouse,The new version is actually pretty good.
Danger Mouse,I tried watching it recently and it was shit. It's all nostalgia man. 
Danger Mouse,[deleted]
Danger Mouse,"I remember Duckula too.

Basically the problem is that ""a spy... except he's a mouse!"" and ""a vampire... except he's a duck!"" aren't great concepts to build a show around. There's no synchrony or irony in the combination of spy and mouse or in the combination of vampire and duck, nothing emerges naturally from that."
Danger Mouse,"Oh man, did I love Count Duckula though"
Danger Mouse,"But those were just artistic decisions, Dangermouse is more ""A spy, except he is incompetent but really lucky"" and Duckula was ""A vampire, except he is a vegetarian hipster (before it was cool) with a teleporting castle"" "
Danger Mouse,I hope they retain the cheeky humor from the original series.
Danger Mouse,"I first thought.

The song writer?

Then brain worked again.

"
Danger Mouse,"used to love this show when I was a kid, and that one with the scary house - trapdoor or something? 

haven't seen in years - might youtube them after the soccer"
Danger Mouse,All these reboots from the glorious yesteryear!
Danger Mouse,"Danger Mouse, Powerpuff Girls, Sailor Moon...what's with all the reboots instead of producing original shows?

If you want to have an irreverent, cheeky british cartoon, just do it BBC. You don't need to wrap it in known characters- if it is good, it will be successful without the brand name. Give us something new instead of rehashing classics."
Danger Mouse,I'm hoping it's still David Jason doing the voice of DM. 
Danger Mouse,"Idk I loved this show as well as ""mighty mouse"" there is something to bringing back classic shows.  However some shows don't need to be brought back because they were just over and done with..... Can you imagine an Iraq version of ""M.A.S.H.""?"
Danger Mouse,Reboots?!  How about originals?   Been so long since I've seen Danger Mouse.  Wonder if it's actually good.
Danger Mouse,"Hopefully they pick up Dr. Katz and The Critic both of those are classic shows. The Critic would have a field day with today's movies.

Danger Mouse,"Do you really want to see him in that weird PS2 CGI style, though?"
Danger Mouse,"As long as they don't do that ""3D"" computer animation, I'm on. "
Danger Mouse,"Yeah, hoping it maintains at least some of the old style."
Danger Mouse,[deleted]
Danger Mouse,"One of the best animated shows as a kid!

I wonder if David Jason will return, probably not..."
Danger Mouse,"As a fan of the original 80s cartoon (which 80s kid wasn't a DM fan?), I tried to watch the new series and while it was good, the BBC barely seemed to air more than the first 15 episodes last time I checked (which, admittedly, was around Christmas/New Year time), despite listing the episode numbers out of 50 so I hope Netflix UK have the complete series."
Danger Mouse,"You Can’t Do That on Television, Turkey TV and Danger Mouse were my shit when I was a kid."
Danger Mouse,"Oh God, I remember you knew you were up way too late once you started seeing the repeats of the earlier Nick at Nite airing."
Danger Mouse,What is Turkey Television? It seemed to be on a lot.
Danger Mouse,"Doctor Who is probably the most extreme example both in terms of overall length of show and gap in between revival. I think it's pretty easily worth it- the revival can be pretty shit at times of course, but so could the original. IMO the revival has overall reached higher peaks than the original.

Arrested Development S1-S3 is like the peak of the sitcom niche it occupies, but S4 and especially S5 are quite disappointing to me. The remix of S4 was even worse imo."
Danger Mouse,[removed]
Danger Mouse,"I was terribly disappointed with the Murphy Brown revival. The original was a workplace comedy with some political commentary. The revival was just heavy political commentary and jokes about getting older. Plus making Murphy's smug son exactly the same politically killed any chance of them having friction.

I liked the Mad About You revival because I thought it had the same feel, but the daughter wasn't very likable."
Danger Mouse,New Beavis and Butthead and Kids in the Hall are great.
Danger Mouse,"Of your list that I've seen, Girl Meets World, Dexter, Doctor Who, and The Twilight Zone were all worthwhile.  There are some others on the wikipedia list I've seen that were mostly okay, no other big hits.

Not a series continuation, but the Psych movies have been good and better than anything listed above.  Lucifer and Cobra Kai were both saved by Netflix and were good, but they were continued pretty quickly.  Same with Stargirl on The CW.

What I've seen:

Girl Meets World - okay and nice to see the original cast, but doesn't live up to the original.  I enjoyed it well enough even though I wish it were better.

Dexter - New Blood was pretty good other than the finale.  Best season of the show after 4 of the original, but not close to the best seasons.

Doctor Who - Haven't seen more than a few clips from the original but the reboot seems better.

Family Guy - I generally am not a fan of this but the continuation seemed to be more of the same.  If it's your humor I'd imagine it's a big hit.

Futurama - I haven't liked what I've seen of the continuations, they lost something for me.

MST3K - It wasn't the same with the different guy.

The Conners - I was young for Roseanne and hadn't seen it consistently when it was first on.  The continuation is okay but not funny enough for a comedy or good enough drama for a drama.  It doesn't live up to my limited memory of Roseanne.

The Twilight Zone - like the original, there were some hits and some misses.  It's easy to remember the hits on the original but there were a lot that weren't.  The continuation lived up to that history.

X-Files - Not good, but the show hadn't been good for awhile before it left the air.  Definitely not needed."
Danger Mouse,"Enjoyed Veronica Mars! I think any invested fan will enjoy but may feel some type of way about the ending.

I think the Futurama reboots are fine, not as consistently good as the original stuff though and I feel like I’m lower on the movies than most.

I think the Arrested Development reboot is kind of a disaster In comparison to the original. Gob and Tobias have really fun storylines but past that it’s pretty skippable.

I thought when Harmon rejoined Community after the gas leak season he did a great job of retooling the show… not as consistently good as before the gas leak but you have some really great ones here and there like the Ass Crack Bandit and the really bizarre one where the app redefines the schools social hierarchy.. it goes into some really weird directions that are worth checking out even though it’s maybe not as good as the show when Donald and Chevy were on it."
Danger Mouse,"Dexter New Blood was a good one. Dexter S8 was the worst thing I've ever watched. New Blood wasn't amazing, but it was way better than S8 for sure."
Danger Mouse,I love the Futurama movies but outside of a half dozen really neat memes I don’t think we got anything good out of the Comedy Central episodes.
Danger Mouse,"Amazing Stories (2020) - Not totally sure if this counts since it's an anthology series that was resurrected, but since OP included The Twilight Zone in their list, I'll count this one. The first episode is legitimately good. No complaints. And I thought episode 3 was okay. Not great, but fine. The rest of the episodes were a bit too silly or predictable for me.

Animaniacs (2020) - It's still a lot of fun, irreverent, and basically what you would want the Animaniacs to be in a revival. The only issue is how few different skits are available. It's almost entirely the Warners and Pinky and the Brain. And the few sketches that deviate from those two are rarely up to the same quality (though some do get there). It's worth watching if you know what you're getting into.

Arrested Development - It has some good laughs throughout the new seasons, and the Season 5 finale is almost the perfect series finale if you cut it off before the final mystery is revealed, but there's so much baggage and not-so-great moments, not to mention the actual final moment of Season 5, that I typically think the show is best with Season 3 as its ending.

Boy Meets World/Girl Meets World - This is maybe worth it if you have a fairly young child that you watch TV with so they can get the majority of enjoyment out of the show and you can enjoy the plot lines and characters from the original show, but of all the episodes I watched, I would not say that this ended up being worth it in the long run because the show really does cater to the younger audience than the older one.

Futurama - Yes, despite a few rough episodes being included in the new runs, the new runs still produce some of the best episodes in the series, progress the overall story of the show in interesting ways, and are still quite funny overall.

Heroes/Heroes: Reborn - Heroes: Reborn is perfectly middle-of-the-road Heroes. It doesn't reach the original show's highs, but it doesn't fall to the original show's lows either. If you liked or were okay with Heroes Season 2, you'll probably enjoy Reborn as it's a similar quality but ultimately better story. But it's not Heroes Season 1 no matter how much it wishes it was.

How I Met Your Father - It originally didn't have to be a continuation, but they have seeded a couple of plot lines from the original show into this one, officially making this a continuation of sorts. While those continued plot lines are fairly fun/interesting, they're such a small part of an otherwise mediocre-at-best show. So while this may one day be worth it as it continues, right now I don't think it is. You could argue that this is closer to a spin-off rather than a continuation/revival though.

Kevin (Probably) Saves the World - This is a weird one because the show itself isn't a continuation to another show. However, there is one episode that acts as a continuation of the show Reaper. And while it was awesome to see the characters from Reaper back and hear a little bit about what's going on in their lives, especially given Reaper's tragic early cancellation, there wasn't quite enough meat on those reveals to make it worth it, particularly when the main Kevin show is so-so itself.

Parks and Recreation - The resurrection for the COVID episode I thought was really well done. I recommend it.

Timeless - The show had gone off the rails in quite a big way, so the fact that the movie resurrection not only managed to tie up loose ends, serve as a satisfying conclusion, and be a fairly consistent an entertaining story was nothing short of impressive. If you liked the first two seasons, it's a must-watch. If you thought those first two seasons were mediocre, it's worth watching to see if it addresses your issues. If you couldn't stand the first two seasons, it's a better version of more of the same. But overall I'd say it was worth it.

The Twilight Zone (2019) - Because it's more or less an anthology series, it has good and bad. If you're convinced you have to watch every episode, I would say it's not worth it. There is far more bad than good in this series. But if you are okay just hitting the highlights, I'd recommend Nightmare at 30,000 Feet, Six Degrees of Freedom, Blurryman (if you're okay with a cool concept that doesn't get its full payoff), Meet in the Middle (if you're okay with an episode that feels like Black Mirror instead of The Twilight Zone), The Who Of You, Among the Untrodden, and A Small Town.

Veronica Mars - I haven't seen the movie, but I quite enjoyed Season 4. I liked it better than Season 3, at least. However, your mileage for this one will vary entirely on how you feel about a certain character because that character is done dirty in the finale. So if you're not the biggest fan of that character OR if the show eventually returns once more to give that ending a little more conclusiveness, then it's worth a watch for fans of the show. Otherwise, it's skippable."
Danger Mouse,"My fiancé *loves* Will & Grace and she absolutely hated the revival, same with Gilmore Girls."
Danger Mouse,"Leverage got revived somewhat recently.

Personally, I think the new episodes are still worth watching, even if I miss the older team dynamics."
Danger Mouse,"Will & Grace (And ""And Just Like That"" the SATC reboot) proved that some things are just better off left in the past."
Danger Mouse,"Ignore list: The X-Files, The Twilight Zone, and Heroes: Reborn.

Good: Dexter: New Blood (Except for the finale)"
Danger Mouse,Warrior about to top the list; if it counts?
Danger Mouse,"Gossip Girl - awful.

Melrose Place - awful, but pleasantly surprised by Ashlee Simpson.

The Connors - needs Roseanne. Sorry, not sorry."
Danger Mouse,Seasons 1-7 of Doctor Who were great other than that none
Danger Mouse,Dr Who for me and then the Equalizer are both great and were a long time coming.
Danger Mouse,"Twin Peaks is the one I would call a fine sequel, reboot, whatever it was, because it kept the vibe. The X-Files now, boy what absolute garbage"
Danger Mouse,Mad About You reboot stunk. It just ignores the original season finale. Has none of the energy of the OG series.
Danger Mouse,Ugh I keep meaning to finish it. I’ve enjoyed what I’ve seen so far.
Danger Mouse,**EPISODE 8**
Danger Mouse,The new Beavis and Butthead is utterly fantastic.  It might be better than it was originally.  Mike Judge fucking rules.  I cannot wait for King of the Hill to return.
Danger Mouse,">Girl Meets World - okay and nice to see the original cast, but doesn't live up to the original.  I enjoyed it well enough even though I wish it were better.

In *Girl*'s defense, it only ran for three seasons, whereas *Boy Meets World* was fortunate enough to get seven, and many of *Boy*'s best episodes were in its fourth and fifth seasons. If we compare *Girl* to only the first three seasons of *Boy*, it's a much closer comparison (although *Boy* still edges it out for sure). I'd like to think *Girl* could have reached even higher heights than it did if it kept going."
Danger Mouse,"I didn't include Community since it never really stopped.

They did six seasons in six years across two networks, with a showrunner blip in Season 4."
Danger Mouse,"I understand it's all opinions, but off the top of my head I'd put ""Lethal Inspection"", ""The Late Philip J. Fry"", ""Game of Tones"", ""Meanwhile"" up against anything from the Fox seasons."
Danger Mouse,The Late Philip J. Fry
Danger Mouse,I dunno. The X-Files continuation wrapped up nicely.
Danger Mouse,8 9 and 10 are light years ahead of 2 6 and 7
Danger Mouse,Yeah definitely not a reboot technically but a show that went through a lot of transformation.
Danger Mouse,"Lethal Inspection is one of the first I’d list for why I don’t think the Comedy Central episodes are good. I can hear an executive at Comedy Central saying “I don’t care if it feels forced and unearned, the audience likes the dead dog episode, make us another dead dog episode!”  Maybe it’s some sort of Andy Kaufman joke that I didn’t get, and they intentionally made a shitty episode and then slapped a sad song on to the end as a middle finger to that executive.  In that case I might have a little respect for it.  Otherwise, no.  Gross."
Danger Mouse,"Is easily the best Comedy Central episode, and slightly better than a mediocre Fox episode.  The average Comedy Central episode is a lot closer in quality to That Darn Katz, which makes A Leela of Her Own look pretty good in comparison."
Danger Mouse,"Also the Jordan Peele ""Twilight Zone"" was largely very good. People who think it was ""too political"" are ridiculous. The original TZ was incredibly political."
Danger Mouse,"Except for Darin Morgan's episode 'Mulder and Scully Meet the Were-Monster', most episodes of season 10 & 11 were boring and meandering, with none of the thrillers and mysteries of the original X-Files."
Danger Mouse,Didn't it end on a cliffhanger though?
Danger Mouse,"I thought it was pretty good.  Uneven, a few really good episodes.  The original was uneven too, but it lasted a long time and there were several really good/great episodes that are most remembered.  I thought it lived up to what the original did but couldn't live up to people's memories of the best half dozen episodes."
Danger Mouse,It did.
Danger Mouse,Well put. I’ve seen a lot of twilight zone and love it but I do think people don’t really remember a lot of episodes cause they just aren’t memorable. I will say I always saw Black Mirror as the updated Twilight Zone.
Danger Mouse,"Yeah, I agree. I think the show got/gets **way** too much hate. It was definitely the best 'reboot' since the days of Serling. If it were given more time to breath, I think it would have gone down as an unquestionably terrific show in and of its own right."
Danger Mouse,"Obligatory plug for the fantastic deep dive series Nick Knacks. Here's the Nick At Nite episode but the while series is worth checking out, especially if you're a fan of things like Defunct Land: https://youtu.be/hQrrLdVFkVA"
Danger Mouse,It was probably just SMPTE color bars at that time of those early morning hours.  AKA the thing I would wake up to in the morning after falling asleep on the couch watching TV.
Danger Mouse,"Based on [this](http://rugratonline.free.fr/nick20b.html)

Probably *Double Dare* and *Monkees*

But, why"
Danger Mouse,[deleted]
Danger Mouse,"My favorite show was Today's Special weekday mornings.  And then the ""Special Delivery"" programming on the weekends."
Danger Mouse,In the early 90s it was paid programming at some point. Source: was an insomniac little kid in the early 90s
Danger Mouse,"wul, hold on there, brother"
Danger Mouse,"Space ghost coast to coast was a god send

Edit: Ooh, mama, am I nervous. Sweatin' like a Trekkie. I smell like oil of Olestra. "
Danger Mouse,So basically 15 years ago today was the most important day for adult cartoons in history.

Giant Robo: The Day the Earth Stood Still,Gonna miss Norm being a puddle of goo if this does come back.
Giant Robo: The Day the Earth Stood Still,"Yes, it ended nicely if there's no renewal. I'm happy. But. But. But, I'd really love a renewal."
Giant Robo: The Day the Earth Stood Still,"After losing Final Space, I'd hate to lose this too."
Giant Robo: The Day the Earth Stood Still,"I hope so, Season 3 is one of the most impressive jumps in quality i have ever seen in a show. Astoundingly good sci fi all around"
Giant Robo: The Day the Earth Stood Still,"granted, shows that change platform usually do so because they were not performing to expectations.

but has any show ever thrived after a change?

I really like orville, and the 3rd season was great.  but yeah, Im not expecting a 4th."
Giant Robo: The Day the Earth Stood Still,Breaking News: There is no news to report.
Giant Robo: The Day the Earth Stood Still,It’s waiting for the ad break to end.
Giant Robo: The Day the Earth Stood Still,That’s nothing. It’s been 232 days since the Young Justice S4 finale and Warner Bros still doesn’t have a Season 5 update.
Giant Robo: The Day the Earth Stood Still,"Unless McFarlane gets a new girlfriend, Orville won't need a season to introduce her as the new  Ensign who-solves-it-all."
Giant Robo: The Day the Earth Stood Still,"Season 3 was not up to the previous seasons quality.  8 of 10 episodes were call backs to previous season plots, only 2 episodes were new material.

1 or 2 would have been fine, but it got really old and tired feeling."
Giant Robo: The Day the Earth Stood Still,"Honestly, if this comes back, it's likely to be in years, and more because MacFarlane and the cast want to do it."
Giant Robo: The Day the Earth Stood Still,"I wonder if he would ever be interested in doing a Star Trek series of his own. Yes, I know Orville and whatnot, obviously. But it would have name recognition and he does love that universe afaik"
Giant Robo: The Day the Earth Stood Still,Maybe they can bring jokes back too.
Giant Robo: The Day the Earth Stood Still,I'm still waiting on the latest season to show up on Dutch Disney+. Really don't understand the lag on uploading their own shows that aren't on other services here.
Giant Robo: The Day the Earth Stood Still,"Ironically the longer it goes, the better the chances it gets renewed"
Giant Robo: The Day the Earth Stood Still,Strange new worlds might make a comeback harder. Stepping in similar territory.
Giant Robo: The Day the Earth Stood Still,It got all serious and weird in the later seasons
Giant Robo: The Day the Earth Stood Still,"Season 3 was a step back and lost what made Orville great, Charly also ruined the show imo. I haven't been able to get past the first couple episodes in season 3, so maybe it gets better."
Giant Robo: The Day the Earth Stood Still,"Meh, it's fine.  Orville's last season wasn't really my thing.  It made a significant enough change from it's previous seasons that it lost me (i also really disliked Seth's girlfriend on the show).  But, that's just one opinion.  I wouldn't be surprised if it was cancelled.  Most threads I've seen on the 3rd season seem divisive (though on this thread, they seem largely complementary)."
Giant Robo: The Day the Earth Stood Still,Why does good entertaining sci fi have such a hard time finding a hit and keeping it. This show was such a nice surprise for sci fi fans and not that it matters but I was sorta surprised this came from Seth I thought that dude had got too big to still be talented like this.
Giant Robo: The Day the Earth Stood Still,Thought that was Vin Diesel.
Giant Robo: The Day the Earth Stood Still,"So much potential wasted on this show. It would be great. Amazing. 


If Seth didn't act or star in it. Get a real actor for the lead."
Giant Robo: The Day the Earth Stood Still,"The show is kind of bad. So many plot holes and his desperation to get back with his ex is cringe. Too much about desperation with relationships and most of it drags on like a soap opera in space and it just doesnt fit. 

You have serious moments and they're all running around like children in space.

There's some good moments but between Ed's constant sigh between  every conversation, that is exactly what the show feels like, a constant sigh. 

I'm trying to get through it all though and I love that they put some of the actors from various Star Trek series, which was nice to see."
Giant Robo: The Day the Earth Stood Still,Great show. I hope it comes back for season 4
Giant Robo: The Day the Earth Stood Still,"Ha! That’s nothing, I’ve been waiting 5588 days for a new half life game."
Giant Robo: The Day the Earth Stood Still,This will be one of those shows they never officially cancel but everyone knows it's over. The best I can hope for is a wrap up movie somewhere down the line.
Giant Robo: The Day the Earth Stood Still,Star Trek is better
Giant Robo: The Day the Earth Stood Still,"IMO Season 3 killed itself with the lack of humor. Plus there were some huge issues with the show when we consider how Avenue 5 ended up with the actor who played Neelix (Ethan Phillips) instead of the Orville, talk about dropping the ball Seth."
Giant Robo: The Day the Earth Stood Still,Didn't really like this show even though I liked Family Guy. I've heard later seasons get better but the first one is hard to get through. The dialogue was so bad and cringy.
Giant Robo: The Day the Earth Stood Still,"Season 3 is incredible and I wish more people gave it a chance (I fear many dropped off after the somewhat ""mid"" first season), but I fear they sort of priced themselves out of the next season. Practically every episode was a near feature-length and very high budget. Hopefully, word of mouth will keep it going. Seriously if you haven't done so yet, check it out, season 3 like TNG grew a beard, ironically MacFarlane should have grown one too lol."
Giant Robo: The Day the Earth Stood Still,"I unsubscribed from Hulu, it takes ages to update the new seasons, they move shows and movies I was once able to watch behind a different subscription, and the website on PC is so ass it takes 30 minutes for it to load the main menu."
Giant Robo: The Day the Earth Stood Still,Imagine how us Tales from the Loop enjoyers feel. One of those covid-era things that just got shelved and probably won't ever exist again and no one officially wanted to pull the plug. Mindhunters comes to mind.
Giant Robo: The Day the Earth Stood Still,"Wife subs to Disney+, I got to watch it on there, what a good show."
Giant Robo: The Day the Earth Stood Still,Maybe because this is from the guy who ruined adult animation for plenty of people. And it doesn’t help people won’t believe he can take a serious project after he killed off Brian Griffin only for him to be brought back four episode later.
Giant Robo: The Day the Earth Stood Still,"As much as I want another season, I’m happy with how it ended. I wish we had closure on a certain little girl, but sometimes you don’t have closure in life. 

That said, please do another season…."
Giant Robo: The Day the Earth Stood Still,I really want this show to continue. It’s so good
Giant Robo: The Day the Earth Stood Still,Cuz hbo did it better with Avenue 55 than fox
Giant Robo: The Day the Earth Stood Still,"The 3 seasons we got are already incredible on their own, and they ended on a good note, deserving of the show.

I'm honestly happy if that's the end, but I can't deny that I'm going to miss it if does end up getting cancelled.

Edit: Wow, I guess people don't like the Orville?"
Giant Robo: The Day the Earth Stood Still,The third season was amazing and I want more.
Giant Robo: The Day the Earth Stood Still,It’s so good! Better than modern Star Trek (besides Strange New Worlds). I love how they tackle heavy topics. It’s got the right amount of hokeyness too. Need more hoke!
Giant Robo: The Day the Earth Stood Still,"This show got so preachy and star trekky in season 3, it simply put was unpalatable. If you read anything about the production, it was a nightmare for staff, actors, and producers. Apparently, Seth just showed up when he wanted regardless of call times. The actors would be waiting for hours, in makeup, expected to be ready for whenever he decided to show up without apology. This show is most likely toast, if for no other reason than salary demands from actors for putting up with stuff like that."
Giant Robo: The Day the Earth Stood Still,*laughs in jojo”
Giant Robo: The Day the Earth Stood Still,Better than announcing a cancelation.
Giant Robo: The Day the Earth Stood Still,This show is my absolute favorite. If it doesn’t come back I’ll be gutted.
Giant Robo: The Day the Earth Stood Still,"I think this will be the final straw that causes me to leave all streaming forever. All I'm seeing are price increases, 'password-sharing crackdowns', etc, but all Im getting in return is canceled show after canceled show. While not getting renewed is not exactly the same as being canceled, and Orville didn't really leave a lot of loose ends, its still just giving me less and less reason to get invested in any show until I'm certain its 100% done. Streaming services are literally using the method of throwing shit at a wall and seeing what sticks, however with that method, everything eventually falls."
Giant Robo: The Day the Earth Stood Still,"That's a no.

Just like firefly"
Giant Robo: The Day the Earth Stood Still,I believe in the end they were running out of episode ideas. McFarlane admited himself that they weren't originally planning for anymore than 2 seasons to it so yea no hope for a 4th season in my opinion but who knows? someone could buy it up.
Giant Robo: The Day the Earth Stood Still,There end was crap. But the rest was amazing would love more
Giant Robo: The Day the Earth Stood Still,"Voyager had 172 episodes

DS9 had 173 episodes

TNG had 178 episodes

...so it feels kinda weird that this site did not publish this article a few days earlier or later."
Giant Robo: The Day the Earth Stood Still,Gutting to know we might never find out if they are meant to be or not
Giant Robo: The Day the Earth Stood Still,"Fuck that shit !

We need a series on William Riker ...... Ensign to Admiral ! 

Now that's give me a Kailon Hard On"
Giant Robo: The Day the Earth Stood Still,Lots of comparisons to Star Trek. Don’t forget. Star Trek TOS was also only three seasons. Make a movie time?
Giant Robo: The Day the Earth Stood Still,"Im still making my way through it, sorry guys. When I finish in 4 weeks they will have the data they need"
Giant Robo: The Day the Earth Stood Still,I don't understand why they went all out with the chi and budget on season 3 if it was going to be it's last. Why would the studio invest so much more money into a project they turn around and kill.
Giant Robo: The Day the Earth Stood Still,"Disney+ in the Netherlands: ""hold my beer"". season 3 hasn't even been released yet"
Giant Robo: The Day the Earth Stood Still,"Seth McFarlane has a contract to produce proyects with Universal and this series is produced by 20th Television for Hulu (Disney). 

Considering that he is already very busy with the projects he is developing for Comcast, don’t expect a continuation of this moderately successful expensive series."
Giant Robo: The Day the Earth Stood Still,"maybe it'll be like american auto, which  i thought was canceled and an ok show, but wasn't on the air for over a year, now they have a 2nd season."
Giant Robo: The Day the Earth Stood Still,GIVE IT TO ME
Giant Robo: The Day the Earth Stood Still,Maybe THAT'S the update.
Giant Robo: The Day the Earth Stood Still,*cries in Venture Bros*
Giant Robo: The Day the Earth Stood Still,"Well, Hulu has so many other major big hits they need to focus on, so...


/s"
Giant Robo: The Day the Earth Stood Still,I would love a renewal and home at Disney Plus. But I doubt they're going to do so now. I think they might have been waiting for numbers and it probably didn't look good with Disney and Hulu ratings. Loved you Orville. Will always cherish the good stories.
Giant Robo: The Day the Earth Stood Still,When its renewed the new season probably starts off with his funeral.
Giant Robo: The Day the Earth Stood Still,You can always watch him be a pigeon on the Mike Tyson show.
Giant Robo: The Day the Earth Stood Still,"If you haven’t seen it, there’s always 4 seasons Mike Tyson Mysteries for more Norm."
Giant Robo: The Day the Earth Stood Still,Hopefully Lt. Dan will be more prominent now?
Giant Robo: The Day the Earth Stood Still,Norm Macdonald is dead unfortunately. He passed away in 2021.
Giant Robo: The Day the Earth Stood Still,"It feels like Seth originally wanted just a funny, Star Trek parody series, but accidentally ended up writing one of the more compelling Trek-esq series currently in TV. It feel like what Bob Ross would call “a happy little accident.”"
Giant Robo: The Day the Earth Stood Still,I feel like it lost its comedy in the later seasons...
Giant Robo: The Day the Earth Stood Still,I feel like that was them hedging their bets on this.
Giant Robo: The Day the Earth Stood Still,Me too
Giant Robo: The Day the Earth Stood Still,"I’d almost forgotten about Final Space until this comment, you arsehole. Now I’m sad again"
Giant Robo: The Day the Earth Stood Still,I only watched the first season - is it worth getting back into? Satisfying conclusion?
Giant Robo: The Day the Earth Stood Still,"Final Space is one of my favorites, bummed it only lasted 3 seasons."
Giant Robo: The Day the Earth Stood Still,"I agree. I feel the first two were good in a goofy sci-fi way, but season three really found its balance between humor and real world issues. Character development became solid, and the story line fell into a show with true content."
Giant Robo: The Day the Earth Stood Still,The second to last episode of S3 might just be the best sci fi space battle so far.
Giant Robo: The Day the Earth Stood Still,"Season 3 is where they went full Star Trek instead of a parody. It was a weird shift for me, seeing as we already have Star Trek, going full on makes it feel like a Great Value brand show."
Giant Robo: The Day the Earth Stood Still,"*Longmire* and *Lucifer* both ran three more seasons on Netflix, and *The Expanse* also ran three more seasons on Prime Video. I may be forgetting one or two more.

So, it's not impossible.

The bottleneck here is really more how busy MacFarlane and some of the others seem to be."
Giant Robo: The Day the Earth Stood Still,"Don't have to look too far, MacFarlane's American Dad moved to TBS in 2014 and is *still* going"
Giant Robo: The Day the Earth Stood Still,"You was a Lifetime show, it gained massive popularity after it was added to Netflix, so Netflix has produced season 2 and onwards."
Giant Robo: The Day the Earth Stood Still,"It could be a case of rose-tinted glasses, but I'm fairly sure Stargate SG-1 thrived pretty well after moving from Showtime to Syfy."
Giant Robo: The Day the Earth Stood Still,I think the Expanse maintained its quality and even got better in some ways when it switched from sci-fi to Amazon
Giant Robo: The Day the Earth Stood Still,"Hot topic nowadays, but the mindy project moved from Fox to Hulu. Had three seasons on Fox before getting axed and then Hulu made three more seasons."
Giant Robo: The Day the Earth Stood Still,"Cobra Kai, Lucifer and Manifest might be the most succesful examples.

But what's important is that those shows take advantage from change of the profile of the audience. Netflix has much broader audience on all continents, not just people that still watch broadcast at set hour or sub to some obscure service."
Giant Robo: The Day the Earth Stood Still,The Expanse moved to Amazon and had a HUGE boost in not only quality (you can only imagine how doing hard sci-fi on SYFY vs Amazon looked by comparison) but viewers. With a satisfying ending.
Giant Robo: The Day the Earth Stood Still,"Brooklyn 99 moved and it gained. Not sure by a giant metric, as people liked it before, but still."
Giant Robo: The Day the Earth Stood Still,"Not TV, but now TV adjacent. 
The Boys was a DC comic for ?6? issues before they canned it (""what? Garth Ennis is OVER THE TOP??"") and it lasted, what, 5 more years published by Dynamite,  and now has a TV show."
Giant Robo: The Day the Earth Stood Still,"I feel like there is an angle missing from a lot of the comments here. I'd say the Orville platform change is more dramatic.

Outside the US it's now a Disney show, and before that if it was shows at all it was on random channels..that makes it hard to.grow the kind of fanbase to justify the budget.

Pretty much all science fiction is expensive and needs to play across markets, which bring me to a related and maybe more relevant thought.

Seth is a star, but more a star on the US and less so elsewhere, so.less of a fanbase. Above all for me, a lot of his humour is the kind of specific American humor  and cultural.rwferemxes that has little or no resonance outside the US and maybe Canada.

 The format is season 3 is different, but it's still a riff on US sitcoms and with honourable exceptions is rare that they find a global enough audience.

Tl::dr it's a push for it to be a global show, where it likely needs to be that to justify the budget.

It's probably not related, but they have splashed out - I assume a fair chunk of cash - to basically be the home of Doctor Who outside the UK."
Giant Robo: The Day the Earth Stood Still,The show You was a Lifetime original and Netflix picked it up and it's been doing great
Giant Robo: The Day the Earth Stood Still,"Stargate SG-1 spent its first five years on Showtime, then moved to the Sci-Fi Channel and ran another five years, and had a spin off shortly after changing networks."
Giant Robo: The Day the Earth Stood Still,The Expanse
Giant Robo: The Day the Earth Stood Still,"“But has any show thrived after a change?”

Yes, Cobra Kai comes to mind"
Giant Robo: The Day the Earth Stood Still,3rd season dropped the b plots and then I was like “how is this different from the JJ Abrams action focus?”
Giant Robo: The Day the Earth Stood Still,"They haven't announced a cancellation, but [it was reported](https://collider.com/young-justice-season-5-cancelled-hbo-max/) last summer that WBD had no plans to continue the series beyond HBO Max's original order of one season."
Giant Robo: The Day the Earth Stood Still,"Im fine with that.  Young Justice was amazing for season 1 and 2.  3 was bad and 4 was just as bad.  It felt cheap and messy, not sure why."
Giant Robo: The Day the Earth Stood Still,"Maybe he should look for a woman he actually likes instead of just ones he wants to have sex with...

Nah, that's crazy talk"
Giant Robo: The Day the Earth Stood Still,I thought the Avis (“You will be of us.”) episode was pretty well-done.
Giant Robo: The Day the Earth Stood Still,Pardon? It's likely to be  years away because everyone wants to do the show?
Giant Robo: The Day the Earth Stood Still,He probably would be. He originally wrote The Orville so that he could be captain of a starship.
Giant Robo: The Day the Earth Stood Still,I think he would want full creative control...which would be somewhat difficult given more recent handling of the franchise and would probably want to tell the story in 25th century after the events of Picard/TNG/Voyager (which again ST franchise seems hesitant to let anyone do). I think Orville exists purely because it's just easier to make a Star Trek clone and tell a story without nosy execs limiting what you can and cannot tell.
Devil May Cry,"It's made by the Castlevania guys.

But they are also working on new Castlevania content too. I wonder how long the time gap between each season will be."
Devil May Cry,Dante voiced by Chris Pratt and Virgil voiced by Seth Rogen
Devil May Cry,Now Im motivated.
Devil May Cry,"Just please don't make them ""modern"" takes on the characters. Just give us the Dante and Virgil that we know and love."
Devil May Cry,"Just recent bought 1-4 on PS4. Loved the first game, sorta liked the second, and loved 3 and 4! Now saving up money for 5 and DmC. Also watched the first Devil May Cry Anime and liked that too. Dante is my favorite video game character..he’s like exactly what I thought was the peak of cool in 2003 AND ITS AWESOME!"
Devil May Cry,"I'm skeptical of Alex Larsen's involvement writing the scripts. We'll see, I guess.      
    
Really hoping that Power House Studios animates the project but that isn't seeming likely."
Devil May Cry,"I know some people like it, but I just hope it's better than the existing DMC anime. The Dante in that just didn't feel very... Dante-like."
Devil May Cry,"Cool, but anyone else notice how so far a lot of the major adult animated dramas we've been seeing from America are based on video game properties instead of comics? I mean, it's cool, but it makes me wonder if it's because DC/Marvel is so ubiquitous that whatever original comic properties we have outside of those two don't get enough spotlight and popularity to get animated adaptations like you would of a manga (outside of a few exceptions, like Invincible). And even if they do, they always go live-action for some reason, even if it's ill suited to the source material (Umbrella Academy, IMO)."
Devil May Cry,You’re telling me it features Dante from Devil May Cry?
Devil May Cry,Am I the only who thinks that looks like John Rzeznik from the Goo Goo dolls ?
Devil May Cry,"I hope they don't take as many creative liberties with it as they did with Castlevania. Castlevania didn't have much story depth during the Trevor Belmont era, so I can understand switching things up and adding in order to make it a full show. 

DMC on the other hand, already has a well defined world and characters. I'm worried the show-runners won't respect it and just do their own thing again. I don't think that approach will work with DMC like it did Castlevania. Here's hoping."
Devil May Cry,I can't wait till Gura finds out.
Devil May Cry,Didn't know this was being made. Hopefully its just DMC3: The Anime cause thats the best story they had
Devil May Cry,"Ah damn it, it's a netflix anime."
Devil May Cry,Liked the first 2 seasons. 3/4 were good but not as good
Devil May Cry,YESS LETS GOO!!! DMC is an underrated series
Devil May Cry,Oh fuck yes.
Devil May Cry,will it be better than the other devil may cry animated series that had no plot?
Devil May Cry,My hope is that its their adventures in hell after dmc5
Devil May Cry,Hopefully Dan is voicing Vergil still.
Devil May Cry,There was a limited run anime series from at least a decade ago that I enjoyed quite a bit.
Devil May Cry,Dante looks a lot like Nikolaj Coster-Waldau in this picture
Devil May Cry,Steal a soul for a second chance
Devil May Cry,Another one?
Devil May Cry,The original anime of this show was good and entertaining… or at least I thought so
Devil May Cry,Misread as Devil-Man Crybaby and now I've disappointed myself... Where's the door?
Devil May Cry,Dante-Virgil-the writers?
Devil May Cry,Don't know how Vergil's gonna be too involved unless it's before 3 or after 5.. but who knows.
Devil May Cry,It's being made by Adi. There's no confirmation that Power House is involved.
Devil May Cry,I hope it's better animated than Blood of Zeus was. That show was stupid and fun but DAMN it needed a bigger budget.
Devil May Cry,Considering how much I liked Castlevania I am really fucking hyped about this. I loved the games when I was a kid.
Devil May Cry,The perfect Reddit comment doesn't exi..
Devil May Cry,"Vergil smokes a joint ""Now I'm motivated hehehehehe"""
Devil May Cry,Nero voiced by Kevin Hart
Devil May Cry,"""Why do you refuse to gain power? To tap the power in your veins, the power of the demon world? The power of our father Sparda? Heh-heh-heh-heh."""
Devil May Cry,"Hey, DmC was an all right game. It was just a terrible DMC game."
Devil May Cry,"I can already see ""DMC will be updated for a modern audience"""
Devil May Cry,It's okay. You don't have to like DMC2. Nobody did.
Devil May Cry,[deleted]
Devil May Cry,Why is that unlikely?
Devil May Cry,"He wasn't sassy, he was all business. More like dmc 2 Dante. Still enjoyed it, but I agree with you."
Devil May Cry,[deleted]
Devil May Cry,I will defend the anime to my grave. It fits in the timeline very well as it’s sits between DMC1 and DMC2. Plus it gives some awesome depth to his character and his not just wacky pizza man 100% of the time. It’s also interesting to see just his day to day life in taking smaller jobs and the role demons play in society.
Devil May Cry,It's not underrated at all...
Devil May Cry,"Didn't he do Castlevania?

I am pretty sure they would use the same animators."
Devil May Cry,What's power house
Devil May Cry,The soundtrack was great. Plus everybody loves ninja theory now
Devil May Cry,"First time I played it, I was like the mechanics are literally the same, come on. Second time I was good enough at the other DMC games to see how much they'd simplified the mechanical complexity of the combat."
Devil May Cry,"Now that's just not true, change a couple of details and it would make a decent prequel to DMC 3."
Devil May Cry,"Yeah, I just played through that game for the first time recently and really enjoyed it despite all the flack it got.  It would've been nice to get a sequel to finish the story, but I can definitely understand why DmC fans were unhappy with it."
Devil May Cry, Im fucking terrified of that honestly
Devil May Cry,"Well that could be code for ""We made it woke for people who wont bother watching it even though we're pandering to them now"".

Hopefully not though. Not a good sign either way"
Devil May Cry,"Calm down, Satan."
Devil May Cry,Dante looked cool in the game though…but that helicopter fight was unbearable lol
Devil May Cry,DMC2 is one of the worst games ever made. I wish it was disowned from the franchise/struck out of canon
Devil May Cry,"1 is still solid IMO, and I played it for the first time this year. If you've played a lot of games from that era that is."
Devil May Cry,I think once you know the fact that DMC was originally developed as a Resident Evil game that all of what you said makes a TON of sense.
Devil May Cry,I really suck at the first game…like have to play on easy cause I die so easily and constantly get stuck. Having said that one thing I liked about the first game was that it reminded me of the first uncharted game.
Devil May Cry,You can ALWAYS dodge the attacks right after the cutscene
Devil May Cry,">2 has actually aged ok in comparison.

2 laid the groundwork for a lot of mechanics that 3, 4, and 5 build off of."
Devil May Cry,"This is one of my biggest unpopular opinions. It's _playable_, but I generally found it really frustrating and janky to play by today's standards."
Devil May Cry,"He's currently [embroiled in a lawsuit](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/castlevania-adi-shankar-sues-excluded-netflix-spin-off-1234999490/) against the production company and Kevin Kolde who he claims have excluded him from a spin-off Castlevania series being developed by Power House.     
   
Simultaneously, he's been working with animation studio Bobbypills to produce [Captain Laserhawk](https://www.bobbypills.com/work/captainlaserhawk).    
    
Bobbypills is showcasing a very kinetic, high-energy style and in a [recent interview](https://youtu.be/VCnL5DbNs6Q) Adi Shankar basically said that in regards to the Devil May Cry show he wouldn't want to just try to make another Castlevania and wants to focus on developing a unique style for this show.      
    
None of these things in a vacuum imply he wouldn't work with the studio, but obviously I have my suspicions given all if this information."
Devil May Cry,"Everyone agrees that there's no such thing as DMC2. He had plenty of personality in the first game, maybe go back and watch some cutscenes. DMC3 is when he was fleshed out the most and DMC4 and 5 just furthered that. He's older in those game and they did his character right.


Heck, even that pointless remake attempt was better than what they did in DM2. I'm 99% sure it's actually not even canon at this point considering all the other games after it."
Devil May Cry,"I love how I got downvoted for expressing an opinion that literally offends no one but hey, here’s to hoping your miserable day gets better 🤣"
Devil May Cry,"He was a co-producer on Castlevania.     
   
Since then, he's been shafted on the recent spin-off of Castlevania by the producer he co-produced the show with.       
   
Most recently he is working with animation studio Bobbypills to produce [Captain Laserhawk](https://www.bobbypills.com/work/captainlaserhawk)."
Devil May Cry,The studio that animated Castlevania.
Devil May Cry,Executives are frustratingly predictable.
Devil May Cry,😢 😢 not the woke brigade ruining my shows 😢 😢
Devil May Cry,"Lol you're like the seagulls in Finding Nemo. ""Woke? Woke? Woke?"""
Devil May Cry,I actually think it was. I remember reading in a game magazine how some higher up tried to completely explain away 2.
Devil May Cry,"To sum up - Dante's personality was and still is defined by Reuben Langdon, who did the voice acting and mocap for Dante in DMC 3, 4, and 5, and did the voice for the English dub of the anime. Mix in DMC 1 Dante (which is *very* similar) and there ya go.

I like to pretend that DMC 2 Dante was depressed or sick or something which is why he didn't act the same at all. Anime Dante was... Well, anime. Didn't he randomly love strawberry ice-cream or something? Just a typical anime protagonist."
Devil May Cry,Calling something underRATED is not an opinion. It’s a statement which is simply untrue.
Devil May Cry,That looks pretty good.
Devil May Cry,"Suddenly dante has an adopted sister and vergils  hella gay now ...... nero ? More like neratte.... vergil had a kid ? ..... well of course he did , just cuz he gay it doesnt mean he wont have sex with a person with a vag"
Devil May Cry,"Yea. Although I just really like Power House. I'm really charmed by how they use shadows and how the regalia is designed in Castlevania. Was hoping they'd be animating Devil May Cry but it's frankly more likely that Adi would use Bobbypills given the current situation.      
    
Hopefully they do end up announcing that Power House will work on it but I'm not holding my breath."
Devil May Cry,Who knows maybe they got Ufotable lol.
Devil May Cry,Omg watching Demon Slayer now…some of the best animation I’ve seen—love it.
Devil May Cry,[deleted]
Devil May Cry,"Hope the writing is as good the Castlevania series.Warren Ellis did some great work there.
"
Devil May Cry,So is that guy normally that much of an edge lord douche or was he just doing a bit. Kind of reminded me of jp from grandmas boy. 
Devil May Cry,I couldn't be more ecstatic. DMC deserves a proper anime and Adi is the perfect choice after seeing how great Castlevania was. Fingers crossed he can get Reuben to voice (and Dan/JYB if Nero or Vergil are involved)
Devil May Cry,Devil May Cry was already a good animated series...[IMDB](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1048049/) 
Devil May Cry,How can it be bootleg if it's official licensed from Capcom
Devil May Cry,Sad it's not Zelda like it was rumored to be but this definitely fits the same tone as Castlevania. I'm excited!
Devil May Cry,Jabronis...cool word!
Devil May Cry,"This news really pulls my Devil Trigger. Devil May Cry is one of my favorite series, can't wait!"
Devil May Cry,"Cool DMC is getting some treatment, but uhh wow that dude huh. He's like a very entitled version of Monty Oum. In his 30's and still going through puberty."
Devil May Cry,Paul Stanley is looking pretty good for his age. 
Devil May Cry,Uuuu i hope we get to see vergils relationship with neros mom and the type of adventures he went on with her (only if this is cannon to the games cause i doubt dmc 5 will give us anything)
Devil May Cry,It could be fun like ash vs evil dead
Devil May Cry,Wow he seems like a dick. I like what he did with Castlevania but come on. Laying it on a bit thick aren’t we?
Devil May Cry,"How much is Adi Shankar actually involved in the Castlevania series? I wrote it off completely because I'd read that this fucking awful, cringeworthy hack is involved. Then I looked it up and saw that he's only credited as EP so I've been thinking about watching it after all. Now this.

I know people on Reddit get pretty wild when they try to be critics, but fuck this guy. Not only is he a walking, talking douche chill and bad at what he does, but he's bad for any fandom he attaches himself to."
Devil May Cry,Well I hope it's better than the Devil May Cry anime. I just really didn't enjoy Dante's characterisation in that one.
Devil May Cry,If it's close to the first 12 episode series DMC got I'm down. The poker game episode is probably my favorite if I had to choose.
Devil May Cry,"Yes, but still that this is considered ok and humorous is hypocritical, just saying please see all aspects of offendness and not only cover it up under the pretense of comedy and  satire. "
Devil May Cry,Fuck yes please!
Devil May Cry,"Damn who is this guy?
"
Devil May Cry,Wasn't he supposed to be working on an Assassin's Creed series as well or did that project get shitcannned?
Devil May Cry,Adi Shankar is probably my favourite edgelord of all time solely because he's seemingly oblivious to how insufferable he is
Devil May Cry,No idea who that guy is but I like his weirdness lol 
The Messengers,"Sorry CW but I'm definitively not gonna watch your new show. I don't think there is much to say, it's just bad and that's definitively not an interesting catholic/demon story. All the cool/terrifying stories have been done and with Constantine we've seen that creativity wasn't a good thing so I expect ""The Messengers"" to fail miserably. But I hope the channel can manage to continue to make interesting shows like The100 and in some way Vampire Diaries. I'm not a fan of the latter but for a vampire story it's quite decent, seemed real enough and not cheesy."
The Messengers,"I've been waiting for this to come out. The trailer makes the series look promising. I don't make a judgement call on a series from one episode or a few. 
For a pilot episode, well done. Slow-paced. Not rushed. Just enough tease to keep me interested. Not quite sure where this is leading yet. I like the subtle hints and visuals. Looking forward to episode 2."
The Messengers,"I watched it and rather enjoyed it. Its very interesting
"
The Messengers,"I liked that they did not rush it in usual insanely fast pace typical for CW (I am old dude). In general, I would agree with your analysis. Antagonist could not act with a gun to his head.

> As trite, overblown and obvious as the fundamental plot is, credible, nuanced backstories for the five angels would have elevated the entire show to a more watchable level. The performances are adequate without ever reaching exceptional levels.
"
The Messengers,"Yeah, pretty bad, definitely not watching ep. 2.  "
The Messengers,"Ep. 1 was so unmemorable that by the time Ep. 2 showed up on Hulu, I was puzzled what this Messengers thing was in my queue.

As of Ep. 3, I still have no idea what most of the character names are. I think the astronomer is Abby, and the dude from Revolution is Raul, but that's it."
The Messengers,"You mentioned something I forgot, which I very much appreciated. It was a very slow pilot. Slow, as in, it took the time to develop (at least slightly) each character. It ended on a cliffhanger, with nothing resolved yet. It's a pretty good start for the CW."
The Messengers,"Ratings: 7.6/10 from 582 users  is nothing really. IMDB is useless for ratings at the best of times never mind from such a small sample size. 

That said though it does sound interesting and I will give it a try  based on your post. However whenever I hear about shows like these start at very low ratings I get nervous that they wont last more than 1 season. "
The Messengers,I am big fan of supernatural series and i was hyped when i saw the trailer but after watching the episode i have to say i am not impresssed.I found the acting from certain characters was really bad(maybe because i watched it right after the new episode of vikings)and the plot didnt convinced me.It is still early so i will give it 3-4 episode before i have a full opinion.
The Messengers,"This looks cool.  Any word on that other CW Midseasoner Izombie?
"
The Messengers,I’M GONNA FINGER-BANG ELYSE LEVESQUE WITH HER OWN ASS AT BUTT FUCK KING!
The Messengers,"Thank you for making yourself available. I respect your work and I look forward to seeing The impact it will have in the industry as well as the culture. 
1. I’ve been taught that when we say yes to one thing we say no to another. What was your biggest yes? And what was your biggest no?
2. Do you have any surprising interests few people know about?
3. What would you most like to be remembered for?"
The Messengers,I HOPE LYRIQ BENT WENT TO BURGER KING AND TOUCHED ELYSE LEVESQUE’S BOOBIES!
The Messengers,Thanks for putting this together for us. I really appreciate it.
The Messengers,Galavant looks terrible and fantastic at the same time.
The Messengers,Jane the Virgin seems like it has one of the oddest premises for a network show that I've ever seen.
The Messengers,"I think it's great that Karen Gillan is getting a chance to star in her own show and I'm big fan of John Cho, but Selfie looks abysmal. I think it will be one of the first shows to be cancelled next season.

It's a shame that ABC cancelled Suburgatory and Trophy Wife only to replace them with something like Selfie."
The Messengers,"Grace point,  the only good thing so far in this remake of broadchurch is David Tennant. 

Hopefully this will be good although I have no expectations. "
The Messengers,"Depending on where they go with it, Last Man on Earth might be neat."
The Messengers,"Scorpian looks like Leverage: Asperger's Edition   
   
I'll give it a few episodes."
The Messengers,"I'm looking forward to see Matthew Perry in the odd couple, unfortunately there's no previews anywhere. "
The Messengers,"ABC looks like it has a strong lineup this year.  I didn't see much else that I was interested from the other networks.  Except for the Librarians, which will probably be terrible, but in a totally awesome, cheese-filled way."
The Messengers,"Already looks to be a rather disappointing line-up, filled with bland sitcoms and procedurals. The only ones that seem even remotely intriguing are the comic book adaptations and even those had some disappointing trailers."
The Messengers,I was hoping someone would do a post exactly like this. Thanks!
The Messengers,"Really looking forward to Backstrom, Stalker, Scorpion, The Flash and How to get away with murder. I cant wait!"
The Messengers,[deleted]
The Messengers,"Very interested in The Flash, Constantine and Backstrom. Galavant and the Librarians look campy and ridiculous in the best way possible, so will probably be checking both of those out."
The Messengers,"Rush seems to be just like Ray Donovan was in the first episode and doesnt focus on the family crap.   
"
The Messengers,Thanks for this. Really like having them all in one place. Here is one for Welcome to Sweden that starts in July: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZppGW7CZ5wc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZppGW7CZ5wc)
The Messengers,"Honestly, Galavant looks fantastically fun.  I will watch every moment of that show.  "
The Messengers,"This reminds me how pathetic Network TV is at creating new shows. Only a few of those have me mildly curious. 

"
The Messengers,"Off the Boat, Gotham and Flash look the best imo, gonna give Mulaney a try too, hope its as good as his standup    
EDIT: and Constantine, hopefully its good enough to entertain until Hannibal returns!"
The Messengers,Anyone know the song in the Hieroglyph trailer?
The Messengers,"Thank you for this. 

Btw, Red Band Society has a preview / introduction [trailer](http://youtu.be/jDsaZaPjm-c) but I think it was pulled from Fox's youtube channel. Also shameless plug for /r/RedBandSociety. "
The Messengers,[Some analysis on a lot of these by Andy Greenwald for Grantland.com](http://grantland.com/features/tv-season-preview-2014-upfronts/)
The Messengers,"Is anyone actually excited about Jane the Virgin? Not a show I'd be into at all, it seems like it'll be cancelled relatively quick unless there's something I'm not aware of."
The Messengers,"I hate to be negative before I even get off the horse, but most of these look like they're going to suck. The only one that caught my eye was Constantine, and that was because of the name recognition."
The Messengers,"Thanks for the awesome list, highly appreciated!

Sadly, I only made it half way through the list before these trailers put me to sleep.  I guess it'll be good for curing my insomnia."
The Messengers,"For everyone still looking at this post: I forgot to post that I made a small blogpost for this list, including expandable YouTube embeds.

→ [TV Show Trailers 2014](http://static.andreasherten.de/2014/05/19/tv-show-trailer-2014.html)"
The Messengers,"Looks like some really good shows coming soon and also some awful ones.

Any new shows that have very recently started that people can recommend?
"
The Messengers,And for choosing videos available for people outside the U.S! 
The Messengers,You're welcome :).
The Messengers,This is going away quickly like those remakes of British procedurals with sci-fi premise
The Messengers,i'm not so sure about terrible. it looks glorious. and even if it isn't: at least its something new
The Messengers,I suspect it'll have a lot of slut shaming.
The Messengers,"I feel like television is just the wrong medium for the story. The premise works as a 100-minute meet-cute/rom-com, but I don't know how they'd keep it going for a full season, forget about a chance for renewal."
The Messengers,"I'll try the first two couple of episodes. Like you said, the concept looks really really bad but I'm willing to give it a shot, only for Karen and John Cho. 
"
The Messengers,The beginning of the trailer really is horrible… But after this over the top eye-candy-ish beginning it at least gets a little bit better. I want to believe.
The Messengers,There's an[ article](http://www.thewire.com/entertainment/2014/05/all-24-new-tv-series-for-fall-2014-in-order-of-how-fast-theyll-be-cancelled/370972/#disqus_thread) in The Wire that humorously states it will be cancelled just for the title alone. 
The Messengers,"Karen Gillan and John Cho. I was so sold on that alone, but after watching that trailer... oy.   "
The Messengers,"It makes me feel a little bit better that it was written by the same creator as Suburgatory, but it does look pretty rough."
The Messengers,"It looks like a shot-by-shot remake of Broadchurch, pretty much.  I couldn't believe how similar it was."
The Messengers,"Anna Gunn might be pretty good, she stepped up her game for the final season of Breaking Bad"
The Messengers,Not the Y: The Last Man adaption I've been waiting for but it's definitely the most intriguing to me of the bunch to me. No idea how the story will be sustained but I'm interested.
The Messengers,I hope they don't come up with zombies and/or vampires. 
The Messengers,">  Leverage: Asperger's Edition

I thought that was Mind Games?
"
The Messengers,It has Katharine McPhee…!
The Messengers,"With Studio 60, Mr. Sunshine and Go On all failing to survive more than a season I wonder if The Odd Couple will be Perry's last chance to anchor a series?"
The Messengers,"I thought The Flash and Constantine trailers were pretty good.. Gotham looks pretty boring to me though.

"
The Messengers,"really? this is one of my favorite new lineups in years! I didn't pick up any new shows last fall but i think empire, american crime, and how to get away with murder all look fantastic. maybe ill even watch the whispers- unconvincing premise but very creepy trailer"
The Messengers,They're nailing themselves into a coffin with these stenciled shows.  It's only solidifying the fresher shows made by Netflix and amazon.  
The Messengers,"Backstrom looks good, but I wonder if it will be able to get past people who think of it just as Dwight Schrute playing House as a cop. Also, I think eccentric detective is probably the most played out character on television at the moment."
The Messengers,"You're welcome!  
Originally I thought collecting only the shows introduced or shown during the Upfronts. But, what the heck, I added Welcome to Sweden.  
Thank you for pointing to the trailer – it's great!"
The Messengers,"Mulaney,  Virgin Jane, the comedies are by far the worst. 

Edit: also why is USA recreating the same show over with rush? "
The Messengers,I edited the post and added the trailer! Thanks!
The Messengers,"I am myself not from the US. Only for the Complications trailer I did not find an alternative :( – but this one isn't even properly listed at the USA website…

I will never get the point of geoblocking *trailers*, though. »Hey, let's invest an huge amount of promotion budget into showing off what great shows we are going to have in our line up. But, since we are ABC, we'll just show it to US people. Because.«"
The Messengers,"Btw, relevant :)

http://tv-trailers.net/"
The Messengers,I feel like it's gonna turn out to be one of those shows with a potential cult following in the future.
The Messengers,"I feel like that is true for almost every romantic show on this list. They should be movies, not TV shows"
The Messengers,Apparently it has the same writer who has written a different ending. I think it will start off the same way and then diverge from the original series
The Messengers,The cast is astounding as well
The Messengers,"I really liked studio 60, such a great show.

I'm hoping this will be good and not campy or have any laugh tracks. "
The Messengers,The same with Jason O'Mara… Actors trying to find a sticking show on TV…
The Messengers,"Flash was pretty good, not entirely convinced but good enough. Constantine has me worried that it might just be a Supernatural with a bigger budget and Constantine tag put on. It would still be alright, just a shame of the wasted license. Gotham's trailer relied too heavily on ""Batman, the prequel"" rather than having its own story to tell."
The Messengers,That's awesome! Thank you!
The Messengers,I can't recall from the top of my head any cult procedurals. 
The Messengers,"The funny thing is, most of them won't last past a season, so why not just make them one season to begin with and have a proper beginning, middle and end? I don't know why American TV doesn't do that, Asia has one season rom coms all the time and they're massively popular. Of course, with comedy sometimes the premise doesn't mean anything and it morphs into something different when the cast is good and gels, so we'll see."
The Messengers,"I have faith in Marry Me. Ken Marino is hilarious in everything he does, and I thought Casey Wilson was actually pretty funny in the trailer. I'll definitely watch the first couple episodes."
The Messengers,Almost human had a cult following.
The Messengers,"> Almost human cult following

But Wikipedia does not say that! :-)"
The Messengers,Lol. Also why do you think Galavant will be canceled in one season?
The Messengers,I do not really think that. I have no idea how it will go. I had only one idea that came to my head that came to me after seeing it and I expressed it. 
The Messengers,"Most people, especially in their 30's and older, could not possibly remember how many different shows they've watched in their life."
The Messengers,I have watched all of the shows.
The Messengers,"Not gonna list anything here, but [trakt.tv](https://trakt.tv/) is a somewhat of a good site to keep track of this kind of stuff. Case in point, I've watched 16,894 episodes according to the site and I usually only check in when I finish a season.
"
The Messengers,Roughly 130 shows. I'd say at least 90 all the way through.
The Messengers,[deleted]
The Messengers,"You're watching 24: Legacy, but you never watched the original? "
The Messengers,"I used to keep up with almost every new HBO/Showtime/FX/major cable drama on television.

In the past year or two, I've lost interest in most new shows. The only show I watch as it airs is Better Call Saul. Will probably watch future seasons of American Crime Story as well. 

I re-watch a lot of shows now. "
The Messengers,"Yeah I'm not great at remembering everything I watch.

I know I watched The Walking Dead up to Season 6 and like 10 episodes into Season 6.

I've watched like the first 2 seasons of Halt and Catch Fire(Great Show). 

Right now I'm binge watching Shameless (Great Show)


And then after Shameless I'll be back onto binge watching X-Files(On season 2 and it's a pretty good show) 


 I don't think I've ever watched  a show to completion as a 16 year old.


See the problem with TV is that it's much easier to watch shit when it's finished, but when it's still on going it's a hard thing to keep up with.

I prefer movies because it's often one and done.

"
The Messengers,Ask Netflix
The Messengers,"hey this is pretty old but i just wanted to pitch an app i use to keep track of all my shows and even which episode i'm on.

its called tvshow time, its very useful and even tells you how many days/hours you've watched. Anyways its a lot better than a word doc haha"
The Messengers,"I'm currently binge watching the following on Netflix:

* Young Justice

The Messengers,"Surprised that his parents let him have his own computer/TV. It sounds like he is still wetting the bed, getting that dick out. How many TV shows have you watched before, is just embarrassing, news flash nobody cares, wet's his pants and then hangs them up on Reddit. 

Look at how they are all in the same demographic. What is wrong with children today.  I thought I was going to find more diversity on that boast, instead of those tweenie numbers.

Mods should remove shit like this, unless they are airing this tripe, it figures why the sub looks as bad as it does, and why it is that contest with this background. My god there is like no variance in the above, it is quite sad which slot that fits into. I am surprised it watches Bojack, than again that might be because of its other yawn.........."
The Messengers,that's why i have it in a word document
The Messengers,All the shows on my list or all the shows in the world?
The Messengers,Where do you find your amount of episodes watched on trakt? Can't seem to find it.
The Messengers,Nice one man. No iron fist on that list?
The Messengers,"I will start it eventually, I just had too many shows on my plate but when I saw that the sequel was just starting I had to watch it."
The Messengers,"When I started watching tv as a kid/teeneager, there was no such thing as a word document. Or even the internet, lol."
Kong: King of the Apes,Netflix should buy avatar. Its online only now on Nick. It should also buy tron uprising and finish the series (Disney owns it bleh)
Kong: King of the Apes,There was already an animated King Kong show [Kong: the animate series](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0285377/).
Kong: King of the Apes,I would rather watch [Johnny's Bananas](http://imgur.com/9sCAAVd)
Kong: King of the Apes,kong looks way bigger than he is supposed to be in that pic
Kong: King of the Apes,"When the prequel movie ""Skull Island"" comes out, Netflix can add it to their list too."
Kong: King of the Apes,I wish Netflix would buy Futurama
Kong: King of the Apes,yay another hemlock grove!
Kong: King of the Apes,Avatar is done though.
Kong: King of the Apes,"Which was basically a ripoff of the better show, [*Godzilla: The Animated Series*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&v=EbfmC7_CdK4#t=3), crossed with elements of *Power Rangers* and *The Mummy*"
Kong: King of the Apes,There was a 60's cartoon as well. I remember watching it during the 80's.
Kong: King of the Apes,"I don't. New seasons weren't the same quality as the older ones, and the shows officially ""ended"" 3 times now. Let it keep the ending that actually fit. I'd rather keep it as it is then let it deteriorate into The Simpsons or Family guy, eventhough I still like them both, they don't hold a candle to the older seasons."
Kong: King of the Apes,"Why don't people get this? 52 episodes is generally the limit for animated programming. Unless you're Spongebob, you're either going to end, or get rebranded. These guys' jobs are not in danger. They have a good relationship with Nick. It's always been the plan to end with season 4, just like the original series ended with 3. I'm looking forward to seeing what they do next."
Kong: King of the Apes,Your right but I enjoyed both.
Kong: King of the Apes,"Godzookie, the friggin lizard counterpart to Scrappy"
Kong: King of the Apes,"I disagree. The last few seasons were just as funny and awesome as the original seasons. It's only been cancelled twice btw, once by Fox and once by CC. "
Kong: King of the Apes,"This avatar story its done. I think he is saying for the next avatar series. The creators said that they will take a break from the avatar universs to work on other IPs wich im really Exciter about but they also said that they cant and they wont end the franchise with legend of korra. 
Nick probably wong sell the avatar IP,since it excels at post-air sales such as DVD, Br , books ans merchandise. And even Netflix bought it , i dont know if the quality  of the series wouldnt drop since the budget its 1,5 mil per episode."
Kong: King of the Apes,"I never said they've been canceled 3 times, they've simply had 3 endings. The Devils Hands are Idle Playthings, into the Wild Green Yonder, and then the final episode of the last season Meanwhile. They've had 3 perfectly good endings, there's no need to bring them back again."
Kong: King of the Apes,This is great news thank you. It just sucks that this is the final season. Always craving for more avatar. 
Kong: King of the Apes,rip Luanne ☹️
Kong: King of the Apes,When my dad was in a nursing home there was another old man who sounded just like Boomhauer.
Kong: King of the Apes,I need more Rusty shackelford in my life.
Kong: King of the Apes,Was there some sort of unofficial announcement months ago?  Why have I been thinking new eps would be out in 2023 for a while now?
Kong: King of the Apes,"King of the Hill never leaves my Watchlist on Hulu. When I finish it, I immediately start it over. I'm in double digits for rewatches for sure. And it's not like I'm watching it every day, but that show is timeless for me."
Kong: King of the Apes,Yep. This is great news I'll tell you hwhat.
Kong: King of the Apes,Resplendent
Kong: King of the Apes,"“Yeah, man I tell you whot man, that dang Ol’ Greg, talking about O.G. and then that Mike Judge … Inspirations, man … the original show, dang ol’ classic … Got my kids, man, walking around talking about ‘That’s my purse! I don’t know you!’ Feeling blessed, man, I tell you whot ‘Feel so Good’ is a great song, I don’t care what no-dang-body says …” added Patterson in an appropriate statement."
Kong: King of the Apes,"I swear the older I get the funnier this show gets. It felt so vanilla when I was a teenager, but now it’s relatable, and brilliantly observant as anything else done by Mike Judge."
Kong: King of the Apes,"I first read this as "" 'King of the Hill' Revival Ordered by Judge"""
Kong: King of the Apes,bAAUhhh
Kong: King of the Apes,"I notice there's no mention of Toby Huss in the returning cast. There's zero chance he's going to voice Kahn this time, I wonder if they're going to kill him off or recast him.

Also wonder if they give Huss another role. Obviously can't be Cotton unless they do flashbacks or he's a ghost lol. Maybe he voices Good Hank?"
Kong: King of the Apes,"if this somehow revives interest in King of the Hill Youtube Poops, I'll definitely watch it."
Kong: King of the Apes,Judge killed it with Silicon Valley. I'm expecting this will be great.
Kong: King of the Apes,"Yay but sad that there’s not gonna be any Luanne, Lucky or even Ladybird."
Kong: King of the Apes,[where boomhauer came from interview](https://youtu.be/rd_rty0ovgQ)
Kong: King of the Apes,They saw the numbers. r/kingofthehill are the real heroes for this.
Kong: King of the Apes,"I'm a MASSIVE fan of this series, so this news could not be more welcomed!  

Interesting that as they're talking about the original cast returning, there's no mention of Kahn.  Toby Huss is incredible in the role, but I wouldn't be shocked with today's climate if they decide to recast Kahn with an Asian voice actor."
Kong: King of the Apes,"I hope that they give Lucky and Luanne a ""happily ever after"" sorta ending. Please for the love of god just have them mention how they just moved away to a nice big house and are just raising their baby."
Kong: King of the Apes,"Details:

>Hulu is laying out the welcome Matt for the Hill Family: the streamer is reviving King of the Hill from 20th Television Animation, with co-creators Mike Judge and Greg Daniels set to return, as well as the beloved former cast.

>Judge will reprise his role as Hank Hill, while Kathy Najimy will be back as his wife Peggy, Stephen Root as Bill, Pamela Adlon as Bobby Hill, Johnny Hardwick as Dale and Lauren Tom as Minh. The reboot has been in the works since the 2017 San Francisco Sketchfest, where Judge and Daniels reconnected with the cast and celebrated the 20th anniversary of the old Fox animated show."

Kong: King of the Apes,"When my dad died KOtH played every night from 11:30-3am. I watched it over and over. 16 years later and I still go to sleep with those banjos playing in the background - it’s my comfort zone

I can’t imagine watching an episode that I don’t know verbatim but I’m here for it"
Kong: King of the Apes,Hulu's just leaning all the way into the revival game...
Kong: King of the Apes,No mention of Toby Huss probably answers that uncomfortable question.
Kong: King of the Apes,"I’m so excited, the new Beavis and Butthead movie and show both slap, he’s still got it"
Kong: King of the Apes,"Isn't this, like, the second or third time they've announced this in the last few years?"
Kong: King of the Apes,Imagine Dale who's the most paranoid about the government being the one that uses Facebook and tiktok the most.
Kong: King of the Apes,"Just have Luanne and Lucky be living somewhere far away or traveling the world on some money from another of Lucky’s scams and send a postcard every now and then. 

There. Casting solved and happy ending for the characters."
Kong: King of the Apes,"Forget DC, this is the biggest news of the day"
Kong: King of the Apes,"as someone from around the parts of texas this show is hypothetically taking place, i really hope i can see the modernisms in what i see going on"
Kong: King of the Apes,His will be done.
Kong: King of the Apes,This has to be the best news of the day for me!
Kong: King of the Apes,This news made my day. Really hope the rumored time jump is true. Bobby in his twenties would be something else.
Kong: King of the Apes,"Oof I don't know how to handle Luanne and Lucky. Saying ""they moved"" is a little tacky but saying they passed is pretty morose for a show like this"
Kong: King of the Apes,"Darnit Bobby put down that blocks and mow the lawn!

Its roblox Dad."
Kong: King of the Apes,That’s my purse! I don’t know you!!!!
Kong: King of the Apes,Who is going to voice Luanne?
Kong: King of the Apes,"I really the animation will be hand drawn, not all digital. Looks far superior."
Kong: King of the Apes,""" Bobby, if you weren't my son, I'd hug you"""
Kong: King of the Apes,"Love the show, but just wish they would make new stuff instead of trying to go back to nostalgia. ( goes for movies and tv shows)"
Kong: King of the Apes,"Mike Judge is great. He always holds on to his vision, he doesn’t approve shitty knock offs or let studios pressure him into watering things down. And his influence on 90s music culture is still very overlooked IMO. There are so many bands I learned of through Beavis and Butthead that I otherwise probably never would have."

Kong: King of the Apes,Wow. The Mike Judge timeline really has reached its Renaissance...
Kong: King of the Apes,no way... I just started watching it few days ago... love the simplicity of the show and the characters.
Kong: King of the Apes,"The great news is that Johnny Hardwick has been taking videos shooting cowboy guns and singing about pocket sand as Dale on Youtube for years, so his voice is primed and ready to go."

Kong: King of the Apes,"This is one of the best things I've heard this year thus far!! Now this show may not be for everyone but for those who enjoyed it or grew up with it being a presence on their TV this is awesome. Some may say this show is dumb, but this show teaches more values, manners, cultural differences, being thankful, acknowledging a mistake and manning up to own it, respect to others in our lives, and how different people can be. I can't wait for this to aire, just as I'm sure John Redcorn can't wait to fix Nancy's next headache. Lol"

Rebellion,"This reminds me of a post I saw on Twitter with all the character posters from Rogue One asking ""Who deserves their own show next?"". I'm not so sure that the character of Cassian Andor even ""deserved"" his own show. Don't get me wrong Andor is maybe my favorite tv show this year and certainly the best thing on Disney+ to date, but the show wasn't carried on the back of some hype worthy but underutilized character, it was carried by a incredible supporting cast, a smart and thoughtful script, and beautiful cinematography and production design. None of the characters in Rogue One are untapped mines of obvious potential, but if you take any of them and treat them with the same care as a character that Tony Gilroy gave to Cassian Andor you could probably find another critical hit among the cast."
Rebellion,The star was the friends we made along the way
Rebellion,"ok, now the andorian’s are just trolling this subreddit, right?"
Rebellion,I could be marooned on an uninhabited island in the middle of the ocean and a message in a bottle would wash up and all the message would say would be “have you watched Andor yet?”
Rebellion,what is this r/andor
Rebellion,The r/television subscribers were never the star of this subreddit - the disney PR team was
Rebellion,Bold move posting more Andor stuff here. Hope it pays off for you.
Rebellion,"Yo, if you guys don’t stop the Andor spam I’m gonna go ahead and block this sub, this shit is ridiculous, admins wtf is this"
Rebellion,"wow you blew my mind, headline."
Rebellion,That’s it.  I’m officially boycotting this show.  Someone has to take a stand.
Rebellion,"How much more $$$ is Disney going to throw at these “articles?”

The brand is damaged, Andor could be The Sopranos (it’s not even close to the best of HBO) and those fans who left the franchise still won’t return. 

The constant barrage is now keeping people away."
Rebellion,"Shut up about Andor, Jesus Christ"
Rebellion,I’m about to unsubscribe if I see another Andor post. This shit is brutal.
Rebellion,Just make it stop
Rebellion,"I’ve been on a hunger strike until I stop seeing Andor articles here, I think I’m going to starve to death…."
Rebellion,"Damn what even is this headline? What a ""nothing"" sentiment - like why is this even a thing being pondered in journalism?"
Rebellion,Another Andor post? Disney people must be working overtime now.
Rebellion,"No, he's the star of the show. He's name is in the title and gets top credit."
Rebellion,I honestly think this show would’ve done better numbers if it was called Rebellion or something. Andor wasn’t a very memorable character in Rogue One in my opinion and thinking it was about him made me write it off immediately. I didn’t know how great the show would be!
Rebellion,"I’m begging people to actually value actors who give more subdued/withholding/quiet performances. Cassian Andor and OJ Haywood from *Nope* are two of the most impressive performances of the year in part because Luna and Kaluuya are doing so much skillful work on the margins without being given loud, declarative dialogue. Little smirks, facial twitches, brief looks, a small scoff… this stuff matters just as much (and maybe a lot more, honestly) as the louder performances that get most of the attention.

Diego Luna does impeccable work all across the series to build, bit by bit, a convincing character who’s silence and quiet nature speaks magnitudes. Cassian wants very badly to be just some side character in the world of this budding rebellion. Some dude who just clocks in, robs a vault, and then gets to live comfortably in obscurity. So of course he keeps his head down, and stays quiet, and tries hard not to ruffle any feathers. The beauty is in watching him - and watching his face - realize that isn’t possible, and that the Empire (read: fascism) will come for everyone, including him and the people he loves. So he might as well fuckin’ fight.

I love just about every supporting performance in the show (Ebon Moss-Bachrach! Fiona effin’ Shaw! Adria Arjona! Alex Lawther! Andy Serkis! Denise Gough! All so good!) but let’s not get it twisted: Luna is the star and he’s a damn good one. Just the kind of star that often goes unfairly overlooked."
Rebellion,Wake up babe. More paid Andor articles.
Rebellion,Let’s not forget his mother also has the name Andor and she was an important part of the rebellion uprising.
Rebellion,"Babe, it’s time for your four times daily Andor article."
Rebellion,"Oh man, I'm glad someone finally made a post about Andor.  I haven't seen ANYTHING about it on /r/television before."
Rebellion,"I'm sick of being told to watch this. I'm going to make it my life's goal to never watch it out of spite.


Edit: I'm also going to tell other people they shouldn't watch it. Not actively, but like if it ever comes up in casual conversation I'll say they shouldn't watch it."
Rebellion,Watching the finale was a strange experience. It was literally about an occupying army suppressing local rebellion. It was so on the nose there was even an IED explosion scene. Yet American audiences feel like they are identifying with the rebels.
Rebellion,"They should have called the show ""The Uprising"" or ""The Rebellion"" and more people would've watched. A lot of people didn't find the premise interesting knowing the fate of the protagonist. Also, Andor wasn't particularly interesting in Rogue One. I feel like if they renamed the show and have Andor in it as a character a lot more people would've watched."
Rebellion,"No, B2EMO was."
Rebellion,We were all Cassian Andor
Rebellion,i blocked u/chrisbokiul because of the Andor spam on my front page now this shill is picking up the slack.
Rebellion,"As I was watching the show, I honestly kept thinking if it even needed to be about Cassian at all. Like it could easily have been the exact same with a brand new character instead of Cassian."
Rebellion,Andor fucking sucks
Rebellion,Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz
Rebellion,"Andor big good Star Wars show, nobody talk watch Andor so good TV, Star show good Wars talk watch Andor, best Disney big Andor good show, watch? Talk nobody Wars? Star Andor!"
Rebellion,"After all these paid puff pieces that are posted here, I've been telling people not to watch it. It feels like an awful show and I will tell this to everyone."
Rebellion,This is the way
Rebellion,"So yea I've ultimately accepted that this sub and those websites are nothing more than a stinking pile of advertisements in disguise, going to unsub"
Rebellion,Do I need to unsub from r/television? Why is there a post about this show every day? FFS
Rebellion,Leaving this sub until Andor ends
Rebellion,"Babe wake up, another Andor post"
Rebellion,Alright it's about time to unsub from these garbage circle jerk subs
Rebellion,"It’s the best Star Wars property. I am 39, so it’s mature theme carried me like rouge one, even more so. I never really was all in on the rest of Star Wars,  but more of this and you will have a new wave of different Star Wars fans."
Rebellion,"I stopped watching ANY Disney affiliated content a long time ago. Not about to start now because the millionth shill is blasting another pseudo-intellectual take on a show that’s too little too late. Die, Disney, die!"
Rebellion,"Okay, sure, interesting... 😴"
Rebellion,">Don't get me wrong Andor is maybe my favorite tv show this year and certainly the best thing on Disney+ to date, but the show wasn't carried on the back of some hype worthy but underutilized character, it was carried by a incredible supporting cast, a smart and thoughtful script, and beautiful cinematography and production design.

My post thoughts on the show clarify that every character in the show is a separation by degree from Cassian Andor. When the question was asked, why him and my first thought was six degrees of Kevin Bacon.

So how do we get from Cassian Andor the mook, to Capt Andor of the new republic intelligence service and how do you identify weak points in the empire that would leverage the kind of reaction that Luthen wanted and achieved.

Why Luthen chose Andor is kind of fuzzy cause I don't think the show really showed that part of the seduction very well, if at all. Luthen did not need Cassian for the heist, he needed him for his floating morality and his ability to be trained in asymmetric warfare and recruitment. 

Mon Mothma was never going to fight the Empire, at best she is a figure head meant to give legitimacy. People on Ferrix probably would have viewed her like Pelosi or Clinton, but someone like Andor, they would fight. 

So he was not the star, but he was the focus and the lens that shows why every day people would rise up."
Rebellion,I swear to Jesus…
Rebellion,Andor conversations are now officially as lame as grogu conversations. Please stop.
Rebellion,"Again with the fucking andor shill, its beyond obvious at this point just put a limit on show advertsiments per week"
Rebellion,"Cassian Andor was never the star of his own series, B2EMO was"
Rebellion,Andor is Maarva's last name
Rebellion,"Well yes, but it’s not like there was no Cassian either. We get more about him than about actual rebellion members. His family and friends, that wouldn’t need so much on screen time if this was purely about the rebellion

If you think about it, the original trilogy, too, is more about the galaxy, the rebellion and empire, than about Luke himself. So…"
Rebellion,"The biggest mistake they made was giving it the title “andor”

Should have been something like Star Wars: Rouges"
Rebellion,ITT: People forgetting that reddit has always been a wretched hive of scum and villainy (and astroturfing).
Rebellion,"This reminds me of a post I saw earlier today. And last night. Yesterday afternoon. And again in 5 mins. And later this evening I am sure.

Andor, Andor, Andor, Andor, geezus it's at nausea."
Rebellion,Disney really lost money with this show didn't they? How else do you explain the constant stream of bs posts about this somewhat above average show
Rebellion,Tony Gilroy and Yip Man are my best friends
Rebellion,I always had the feeling watching the show that cassian was a bit slow. Like he isn’t computing half of the time.
Rebellion,"Well maybe it should be called ""The Rebellion"" then"
Rebellion,"Cassian Andor will do anything to survive, we see that in the first 5 minutes. He acts like a cornered animal, getting those instincts from his youth on Kenari. He inadvertently sows the seeds of rebellion with the chaos he leaves behind. 

Ferrix: after Cassian leaves, the Empire shows up and starts mistreating people, leading to more rebellion. 

Aldahni: Mon Mothma gets all nervous about her creds after the Aldahni attack. The Empire cracks down and sends more people to prison camps. 

Narkina 1: the harsh prison conditions lead to a prison riot, and to the Narkanians helping them escape. 

There’s also a fun bit of an undercurrent of characters misinterpreting Cassian’s motivations in the show as some big act of rebellion when in reality the guy is just hopscotching from one chaotic escape to the next and holding on for dear life"
Rebellion,Cassias was never the star of his wars—it was the friends he made along the way
Rebellion,at this point I'm gonna spam posts about andor too
Rebellion,Another one
Rebellion,Oh! His name is Andor. That explains everything.
Rebellion,Alright thats it Im unsubbing
Rebellion,Enough
Rebellion,"Another Andor post, are people getting paid to post a new post every day?"
Rebellion,Thanks for posting this. I'm never gonna watch it then. All this time I thought it was a series about the Ewok planet. I didn't even know it was based on the guy that died in Rogue One.
Rebellion,The epitome of wrong place wrong time
Rebellion,I thought Andor was a planet name lol
Rebellion,"The Star was the continuous barrage of fawning over this show. 

#WE GET IT!

I’m so tired of hearing about twitter, and trump, and andor, and musk, and whatever else Reddit’s collective OCD hive mind is obsessing over this week. Aren’t you all sick of it? How many times can we talk about the same fucking things over and over and over. We know! Tie fighters and Elon musk blue check and Kanye west “troubled man.” Holy fuck, what boring people that inhabit this place.

#IT’S A STAR WARS SHOW. 

People will either watch it, or they won’t. If they didn’t watch it when it first dropped, they’re most likely not going to watch it now. And honestly, I can’t blame them. Is this show great? Probably not, judging by the incessant propaganda these “media news outlets” have been pumping out hourly. 

Out of protest (not that it matters), I refuse to watch andor. Disney’s relentless pressuring has made me completely uninterested. Holy shit."
Rebellion,"People whining about this show in comments are more annoying than these posts.

If you don't like it downvote and move on no need spout baseless conspiracy theories that everyone who likes this show form Disney PR.."
Rebellion,best show of 2022.
Rebellion,Sort by controversial to see the truth
Rebellion,"Diego Luna was great as was the rest of the cast but it’s not a character study, Cassian is an idea, a walking metaphor for the rest of the galaxy, where most people were content to ignore the empire and it’s brutality as long as it didn’t touch directly upon them."
Rebellion,"And it’s not simply the lofty ideals of the rebellion, either— it’s the actual on-the-ground reality. The sacrifices, the hard choices, the manipulations and counter-manipulations. The heart of the people that make up the Rebellion."
Rebellion,A Star Wars about a star war
Rebellion,Opinion
Rebellion,Only Star Wars in the background
Rebellion,?
Rebellion,"Bruh, what?!"
Rebellion,Why is his last name the same as a planet name? As a Star Wars casual I was kind confused by that during the Andie TV show.
Rebellion,The true Star Wars Rebels.
Rebellion,"Ye, can someone help me filter out Andor posts from appearing for me? I love the show but these daily's are getting out of hand."
Rebellion,"""It's all about familiarity."""
Rebellion,"The show was “about” Cassian Andor only in so much as it needed a vessel or viewpoint to show the growing sentiment around the rebellion, and the ultimate birth of it after years of gestation. The whole show was about whether or not the average person should believe rebellion was necessary and unavoidable, and it used Cassian to show *other people* dealing with this issue: from the cynical but effective Luthen instigating various attacks and heists, to Skeen who didn’t really care about anything at all and ended up just wanting to take the loot and get out. On top of that, it showed us insight into the Empire itself, again highlighting the actual people behind the faceless wall of absolute power, having to make decisions about the effects of a rebellion and how to deal with it. 

I have so many hopes and expectations for season 2, especially hoping for even broader views of the empire in the midst of the growing insurrection, the political ramifications, and the changing circumstances for normal people on the ground. 

What they have here, in this show, is the much needed deep-dive into the *essence* of the Star Wars universe, rather than just the heroic tales of individual characters that we’ve gotten before. It’s the anti-thesis to Book of Boba Fett, a show about a character that really *doesn’t have* any character to speak of, and whose story never really needed to be told nor has any impact on anyone else’s story at all, really. Andor’s story affects *the whole universe* in a deep and meaningful manner, and is about the vast, core differences and struggles that later set the stage for heroes to come along."
Rebellion,"Yeah, I don't know when was the last time I've seen something with all of the cast just acting the HELL out of their scenes. I'm astounded at how much EVERYONE is great in this. My only real complaint for the season is that it was only 12 episodes long. There were plenty of times where I'd have liked to stick longer to a particular mood or emotion but it had to keep moving to the next thing. Amazing stuff."
Rebellion,I think the show proved that it DIDN'T need specifically Cassian as lead. It could be any new rebellion character because it really doesn't connect Rogue One character with Andor character on any level deeper than actor's face.
Rebellion,"I’m just here to see all the annoying “OMG yet -another- Andor bot article I could scroll over?!?!? Everyone hates that show, boring!!! People should only talk about new shows only please and they should only be shows I like! Give me swooshing lightsabers, nothing else!”"
Rebellion,"That's because they cared about actually making a show. The other shows were all made because of the character and mining nostalgia for them. That's the entire reason for even creating the show, they didn't have a story/concept and figured it out (badly) because they needed the commercial exploitation."
Rebellion,"I’d argue that good writing and casting makes it a solid show. Casting doesn’t feel forced and the writing is solid. Until now all the SW series have been the opposite. 

I also think that the metoo movement was important but it also came with some negatives where castings felt forced.  Just looking back at the force awakens series and Rogue One kind of forced writers to always include stereotypical females in its series. 

Sure this might be a controversial statement but I feel like the female characters in Andor feels thought out and fit in with the story way better than the series before it.

The characters should extend the story not the other way around imo."
Rebellion,So what you're saying is there's a chance we get a Galen Erso show
Rebellion,I need the whole rogue one cast to get a show if they maintain the quality
Rebellion,"I'm pretty positive if we didn't already have a show called Star Wars Rebels, it would have been called something similar."
Rebellion,I especially am glad we met his moms depressed robot. That thing made me sad everytime I saw it.
Rebellion,The star is the wars we fought along the way
Rebellion,"The star was the articles that keep getting spammed to this sub about andor

I want to watch it, but every time its promoted I delay my watch of it out of spite for the hail corporates and mega fans"
Rebellion,"The real stars are the public relations teams who have managed to get a hundred media articles written about this. I swear, Capeck is out and Eiger came back and all the media shills think Disney is going to start spending money on ads again. Little secret, there's no money left."
Rebellion,I'm a fan of the show and I'm tired of it clogging the main TV subreddit.
Rebellion,What of it pinkskin?
Rebellion,"Yeah, right? It's crazy that /r/television is being spammed with posts about...

Versailles,"First some context. The story of the Borgias still fascinates because it was the last great story from medieval Europe. Because so much was destroyed following the death of Rodrigo and the publishing of ""The Prince"" their story became the stuff of legends. 

Lucretia Borgia was likely to have been the most desirable noble-woman of the entire 15th century. Her hold over the imaginations of nearly every man she met led to much of the discord not only between men but entire families. Rodrigo was the culmination of 2 centuries of social climbing within Italy by the Borgia family. While the Italy of the late medieval period was tearing itself apart the Borgias consolidated their family power. 

The series ""The Borgias"" is an historical adaption much the way ""Rome"" was. They played very loose with history and made no attempt to find actors who resembled their real-life counterparts. The only characters that resembled real life were Giulia Farnese and King Charles.

The series ""Borgia"" is faithful to history in the sequence of events and the events themselves. Much is of course recreated owing to the destruction of records and images. However, what details survive is portrayed vividly while what was re-created is plausible. Most of the actors resemble their real-life counterparts with the exceptions of Rodrigo and Giulia. 

All in all I would say that ""Borgia"" is what you'd like if you prefer history while ""The Borgias"" would satisfy those who prefer story-telling."
Versailles,"The Borgias is superior imo, the main cast has much more Charisma, to the point you can actually believe people would follow them. 

I feel the Borgia had a lot of gratuitous sexual violence too."
Versailles,Borgia got annoying quickly in how Cesare busts in at the 11th hour of every crisis with a genius solution that solves every problem.
Versailles,"Spoiler alert. 

I'm watching The Borgias right now and have a few episodes of Season 3 left to watch. I love the spiderwebbed politics aspect of the show but I don't like the incestuous angle that felt like a premonition from the first episode. They could have done without it since there were so many other aspects to explore - Juan's pregnant wife, Guilia's brother, the arc of Alfonso's character etc.  

Might watch Borgia after for comparison purposes!"
Versailles,Really perfered borgia. Really didnt like The Borgias juan
Versailles,"I don't remember which is which since they both basically came out at the same time, but the Jeremy Irons one was pretty bad. He was the only good thing about it, the Cesare actor had all the charisma of a piece of lint.

The other one was actually pretty good, but Doman's American accent was pretty jarring amongst all the other more similar sounding Euro accents. Cesare in this one was much more believable."
Versailles,Borgia is so much better. The Borgias should not have been made
Versailles,"I saw the one with Jeremy Irons, and was supremely disappointed they went with the incest angle which is near universally accepted as propagandist bullshit. I also didn't think Irons really fit the role as a pope very well but I don't know why exactly.  

I'm going to watch the other one eventually and hope it doesn't fall into the same trap."
Versailles,"Agreed. It’s all quite dubious in terms of historical accuracy, but to me The Borgias had more compelling characters."
Versailles,Maybe that's why he is the machiavellian prince?
Versailles,Can you elaborate on why you think it’s better?
Versailles,They used to throw around claims on incest for fun
Versailles,"Slept on this, show any good?"
Versailles,"Watched it as it aired in France, the man in the iron mask plot turned out pretty good. Sucks there won’t be a season 4. "
Versailles,"s03 was better than s02, however, the first season is still the best imho.

PS Am I the only one who got the impression that they cut the budget?"
Versailles,"I can't believe this show is nowhere to be found.  No torrent, no nothing anywhere.  Grr!"
Versailles,"I liked it, but then I enjoy most period dramas so... The fact they filmed on location at Versailles with incredible costumes makes it a beautiful show to watch. 

If you’ve watched Vikings, Athelstan’s actor plays Louis XIV. He’s good. "
Versailles,If you like historical dramas its quite good.  The costumes and sets (on location I believe) are stunning.  Some surprisingly good battle scenes as well.  
Versailles,"Yeah, we've on episode 6 tomorrow in the UK. It's been really good so far. When I heard it'd be the final season, I was disappointed but what a ride."
Versailles,"He is good, really sad his arc in vikings was so limited, there was a lot of interesting ways it could play out, no fault of his ofcourse."
Versailles,"> He’s good. 

Very good. I love this show and the whole cast. So sad this is the last season. "
Versailles,Yes I loved him and his relationship with Ragnar too. It ended too soon. 
Versailles,"> It ended too soon. 

So true. I would have loved a spin-off of just Athelstan. "
Versailles,"I am on episode 3 and thanks to the long weekend here in France, I’ll most likely finish the season tomorrow. 

I am so glad they could film on location inside and outside of Versailles. Amazing production values, which I am not particularly used to with French TV shows. 

About the man in the iron mask: it’s a member of the royal family I bet, but not a secret twin brother. Someone who could make the king doubt his divine power. "
Versailles,Never heard about this show before but I'm intrigued. Dumas is my favorite author.
Versailles,Can I see this in the US yet?  It's one of our favorite shows!   
Versailles,"Is this season better than the second one? I liked the first season, but the second was kinda meh. They wasted too much time on boring stuff."
Versailles,"SEASON 3 IS OUT??? 

I need to find and watch it now. Thank you for the heads up! :) "
Versailles,"Wait, is this back on BBC2 already? I hadn't heard anything about it being back yet.

"
Versailles,"This show is amazing, I'm so glad season three is coming. However I have to wait until it comes to Netflix"
Versailles,"I watched them film a garden party once, it was awesome. An entire day of filming for a three minutes scene top. 

They have been insisting on his divine right thanks to his blood (well, even more so than usual) so you might be right. "
Versailles,"It’s definitely worth a watch then. The first couple of episodes didn’t hook me (too much focus on the court drama) but once the season’s main mystery really starts, it’s better. It has amazing production values too. "
Versailles,"I must say I have no idea, sorry. I am watching on Canal +, French cable. The original version (English) is available though so it might be online somewhere. 

Is the show popular over there? "
Versailles,"> Can I see this in the US yet

It's on TPB"
Versailles,"I am on episode 3 so I can’t talk about the entire season, but so far I enjoy it and the pace is better than last season. There are three big storylines happening at the same time which helps I think. "
Versailles,You’re welcome! Enjoy. 
Versailles,Ovation channel on Comcast 
Versailles,"No idea, I watch it on Canal +, French cable. "
Versailles,Ovation channel on Comcast 
Versailles,"First two seasons were huge on Netflix. I'd pay to watch season 3 without having to wait, though. 

Are you watching it dubbed, or subtitled?"
Versailles,Ha of course it is!  What isn't? 
Versailles,"What is TPB, please? I'm looking for episodes 7-10 of season 3 in the US. Thanks."
Versailles,"I see the S3 blu-ray / DVD will be out May 22 here so maybe elsewhere too? I have no idea how this works. 

I watch in English without subtitles. I tried the dubbed version but I always prefer the original voices. "
Versailles,Ovation channel on Comcast 
Versailles,Yes totally agree.  Subtitles are the way to go respect the original actors' work
Versailles,Thanks! I finished it about a month ago. Sorry to see the series end. It was a great show.
Versailles,where can I watch this online? It looks great.
Versailles,"Its only aired in France so far, it was a big hit. The budget is 2x what they spent on each ep of Downton. Here is a good article on the show. I don't think the USA rights have been sold yet.

http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/features/versailles-will-put-downton-to-shame-a-lavish-tv-series-with-modern-references-a6903951.html"
Versailles,"I have just acquired this series, and am keen to watch it. It will complement my recent viewings of War & Peace and Wolf Hall rather nicely, I hope."
Versailles,This seems like something right up my downton abbey
Versailles,"I watched this show recent days, can't understand why it isn't popular at all. Has all the elements to become a hot show except a well-known cast. But the performers are excellent and good looking. The king and his brother are so charming. "
Versailles,"I may be unlucky, but the two files (from two sites) I got for the first two episodes are English until about 40 minutes in, then it switches to French. Is this normal? "
Versailles,[deleted]
Versailles,It looks like The Tudors.
Versailles,"is it in english, or french with subtitles?"
Versailles,Where did you watch it? 
Versailles,"> I can't recommend it enough

You'll probably need to start with some lighter fare and use the experience to then build up to being able to recommend Versailles sufficiently.



Best thing is -- if you are patient and deliberate -- you may go on to being able to over-recommend Versailles someday soon!


Louie Lui Looey Luae. Good luck."
Versailles,"The only thing that would have made it better is if it were a retelling set in modern times, haha. "
Versailles,"I keep searching the trades for news on a US distributor, because this show looks amazing.  The nudity might be a problem for basic cable, so it will probably be up to one of the pay cable channels to purchase the broadcast rights."
Versailles,from the trailer it seems more adult. I think it's airing stateside sometime this year.
Versailles,"Not so much. It's more of the royal family and the court nobles, than the upstair downstairs thing. There's also more sex, voilence, and political intrigue. 

"
Versailles,It's in English.
Versailles,"From the reviews and the budget I'd guess it won't be cheap, which would only leave Netflix and Amazon. Neither have had shows with graphic sex and nudity, yet. Sounds perfect for HBO but they produce all their shows in house."
Versailles,">more sex, violence, and political intrigue.

Versailles,I hear Versailles will make Downton look like Borgias
Versailles,[deleted]
Versailles,The best thing about this show is the intro song.
Versailles,Saw a commercial on Sky. I'm really tempted to check it out. 
Versailles,"Can't tell which of the comments in here are sincere, shilling or parody of shilling..."
Versailles,"It may well be wonderful show but not possible to put Downton
to shame it is a perfect show. "
Versailles,I hear Versailles will make Borgias look like Duck Dynasty.
Versailles,I really want to see this.  Who were your favorite characters on the show?
Versailles,Isn't costume drama just one notch above day time soap?
Versailles,[deleted]
Versailles,"really depends on the costume drama.  Some of them are fantastic, some of them are awfully funny with how bad they are, and some of them are middle of the road."
Versailles,Not all of them. However yes seminar. And fact there is speculation that Dowton Abbey is ending where it is ending because the creators not want it to devolve into a costume soap opera
Versailles,I am looking forward to seeing George Blagden as Louis.  It seems a huge departure from the modest monk Athelstan in Vikings!
Versailles,Hah. Downton Abbey passed that point a long time ago. 
Versailles,"Yayyy George Blagden! I lost all interest in Vikings when I heard what happened to his character.

And I loved all the behind the scenes stuff/interviews where Travis thrived on making George uncomfortable."
Versailles,I watched what I could of the first season were on demand/ovation and couldn’t ever seem to find the rest/season 2. I was pretty sad because I love the history of Versailles. 
Versailles,You mean the show was cancelled due to nudity????
Versailles,"Both season one and two are on US netflix now. 

I loved season one, season two was great as well but it did feel like it dropped a little story wise."
Versailles,"Ratings have been falling apparently due to nudity, so it hasn’t been renewed. "
Versailles,it has a great story. but one problem I had was difficulty telling the characters apart since they all look alike. Am I the only one who had this problem?
Versailles,"It's fantastic! The show isn't boring, but the lives of the nobility are very boring. Can you imagine having to go to the same party with the same people every night?"
Versailles,Thanks for letting me know it is on Netflix finally. I shall be watching this tomorrow.
Versailles,I'm watching episode 10 now after discovering it on Netflix this morning.....I'm not a proud woman but damn this was good.
Versailles,"Agreed. This was difficult for me, too. I watched it with friends and we all figured out the characters by asking each other and coming to agreement."
Versailles,"Netlfix, where's X-Ray? Seems like Amazon has had this for ages. Push a button, see the character info, very useful. "
Versailles,Thought the same thing. They were prisoners in that castle.
Versailles,"I read somewhere that besides gambling, the only activity they had was bed-hopping, which led to rampant STDs among the aristocracy and thus the rise of the merkin. I have no idea if any STDs cause that sort of hair loss, but it's a good story. "
Versailles,I was going to check it out..until I realized I didn't have the channel
Versailles,"This finished on Australian tv a few weeks ago, think it is still available for free online for Aussie viewers via SBS OnDemand"
Versailles,"I was able to get the first episode for free via iTunes, if you can watch it that way."
Versailles,Did you watch the series?
Versailles,Yes it was some of the best tv I have seen in a while
Versailles,Exciting - I can't wait to keep watching. A+ so far.
Versailles,[deleted]
Versailles,"It's not actually a Netflix show, but it's pretty good. A little bit over the top, but enjoyable I suppose"
